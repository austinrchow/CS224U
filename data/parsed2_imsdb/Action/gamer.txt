written by mark neveldine brian taylor september some of them want to use you some of them want to get used by you some of them want to abuse you
some of them want to be abused eurythmics some years from this exact moment
the beautiful chiming sounds of space travel through the cosmos
dots of light whiz past our face
they could be stars at lightspeed or
subway lights flicker on in a flash we see pale sullen faces riding into a bleak future and hear the industrial clatter
its dark claustrophobic obscure
the rhythmic beat of track and wheel clicks engulf us
the lights flicker back on and hold as we see a half dozen soldiers in brown camo steel eyed prepared for whatever may be at the end of the tunnel
zero in on two kable something roughneck
focused determined eyes burning with internalized emotion
and sandra late s undeniably hot but tough as hell both are in shackles cuffs being roughly transported through underground tunnels knocked and shoved around
uniformed guards roam the train looking pissed off their swagger seems to mask fear
kable is meditating or exhausted hard to tell
the girl makes eye contact w him
kable says nothing just stares at her stoic
sandra contd my name is sandra
shut the fuck up
because he can the guard takes a swing at kables head with a billy club
kables skull snaps back into the window
the guard swings again this time nailing kable square in the stomach
to the guard a snarl putcher dick away
sandra is buckled over awkwardly hands behind her back tethered to the seat head dripping blood
kable jerks against his restraints every inch of him wanting to rip the motherfucker apart
he uses his elbow to help her back up but sandra fights through it sits back up and spits blood she can handle herself
the camera holds tight on kable and sandra
kable lets a glob of blood dangle from his mouth biting his lip bearing it
we hear the crunching sound of the club working on the others
and the metallic rumble and clatter of the train growing louder pounding slamming into our brains blotting out all thought
pov we are running ragged full sprint down a tunnel towards dirty white daylight
no music just heavy breath kables heartbeat and the sound of his boots bouncing off the concrete
others are running with us soldiers with weapons
at the tunnels end vaguely defined shapes of buildings smoke sky
our pov whites out as we
smash into the daylight
smoke plumes hang from a recent skirmish
kable climbs over burning debris gun raised as sandra and the other soldiers disappear into the grey mist
kable emerges from the smoke into
a destroyed city philly
seemingly out of character he leaps through the air slo mo and lands in an overdramatic rockstar pose nine inch nails coachella
in sequence multicolored leds on his weapon come to life accompanied by a low frequency hum that seems to pierce somewhere below human hearing
the multiple turrets spin then snap into place
other brown soldiers emerge like snakes out of dirt holes and into the light
they crouch and spread out
what appear like buzzing flies swarm thru the grey air at a closer look they are like tiny ball bearings that move like hummingbirds magnetically controlled
the swarm splits apart each fly connects with a different soldier they hover one foot above and two feet behind the soldiers head
kable slides behind a shredded telephone pole and takes cover
the sound of trains weapons soldiers all fade away
suddenly a bullet whizzes by kables face a pause then we hear a gunshot
another bullet whirs by his leg and another by his shoulder after the bullets pass we hear the gunshots
see the lightning wait for the thunder
in the peripheral a soldier in deep blue camo runs from behind an old car to a brick staircase
then another blue runs the opposite way closer in the foreground
the silence is crawling deafening and then
all hell breaks loose
suddenly we are in iraq times ten
kables eyes glance down at his weapon the turrets quickly shift and rotate he whips it up in a flash and returns fire into the mist thoom
the shells puncture air and connect distantly
the air ripples all around him his world closing in
he breaks free and runs toward an open street the turrets readjust he efficiently wastes two blues with automatic fire
a couple of pedestrians walk across the street totally ignoring the violence
kable makes a perfect degree cut and wraps around a street lamp and into the alley
a bum holds out a can with a couple of coins and shakes it
from an aerial pov we see the area swarming with brown blue combatants and a dozen civilians
in the top right corner of our frame we see the dull reflection of a face somewhat transparent watching the battle tungsten red similar to your own reflection on a
we snap back to the ground the whole area is a battlezone
kable lines up another blue climbing the fire escape to the third floor window and then coming from the rear surround speakers behind us a voice almost a whisper too
clean and distinct to be outdoors in this environment
and too young to possibly belong to kable
clean disconnected eat shit please
the blue drops like a sack
kable perfectly cuts back another degrees and runs for an old store front
inside a clerk air bags groceries for an empty store
a brown soldier sets up a tripod machine gun and aims for a bunker a hundred yards north
the distant blue targets seem almost robotically unaware
the brown soldier plants his left hand on the ground for stability right hand twisting the grip lock and squeezing the trigger tat tat tat tat tat tat
the blues fall some clumsily colliding into each other before they crash to the ground dead
another team of blues rock their heads around to focus on him
the brown tripod gunner is vaporized from the knees up
the forearm that supported him is standing straight up cleanly severed at the elbow
it slowly wobbles over and connects with the two legs severed at the knees
the three limbs fall into each other forming a flesh and bone tripod
the destruction pushing the bodies and debris out of the way and clearing a path one streaked with crimson red and burnt flesh
it moves fast and vanishes into the smoke clouds
down the road kable saves an east indian woman from getting obliterated by shoving her out of the way of the blazing truck
as kable turns to waste another blue the east indian woman gets right back up
walking into and getting obliterated by another truck
its creepy robotic but violent and too real like a programmed suicide
cant say i didnt try
we sense emotion in kables cold eyes then they flicker to the peripheral
tracking along a row of blown out windows a blue is taking aim we snap zoom in
the transparent ghost of a face as though projected on glass
the lips move in sync with shit
kable spins too late but from the level directly below the sniper through an open doorway we see a brown soldier blasting straight up through the ceiling
the blue is blown to chunks
the brown runs out and hits the curb concrete and meat collapse on the spot where she stood
kable gives her covering fire as she heads his way
they bolt for a corner kable reaches protection first
he stops to let sandra catch up and in that instant her brains get blown to jell o
blood and particles splatter over kables gear
without hesitation kable turns and wastes two more blues
up ahead he sees it an octagon steel shed with small glowing emerald green windows
he makes for it
the little fly following him is picked out of the air by a stray shot plink
contd what the
bullets and shells chop up everything around kable but hes a shell smacks his shoulder hard almost knocking him off his feet shredding the brown camo and revealing the flexible
he scrambles to the octagons entrance and bails in
kable steps into the middle of the vacant steel room
the second he breaks the green laser flood lights blast on all around the battlefield
a submarine alarm sounds from loudspeakers everywhere echoing through the streets cycling the battle is over session complete
kable steps out
the leds on his weapon blink off in sequence
armed guards are everywhere rounding up the i cons
i cons i convicts are the combatants death row inmates lifers of which there are never a shortage
generi cons generic convicts are the street traffic that lend unpredictability and realism to the battlefield
they are computer controlled npcs non player characters
petty thiefs and criminals who are risking their lives by participating to commute their sentences a dozen guards collect weapons two approach kable
his eyes are pure murder sandras brain matter still drips from him
the guard doesnt even flinch
the weapon is dead dormant they all knew it
the guards have a good laugh
kable is clubbed from behind we
back on the rattling train where we started
the surviving soldiers both brown and blue are shackled to the rail wounded exhausted hollow eyed
good run kable
kable only looks to the floor
quietly my names tillman
whatever your name is
you got to the save point fast
so the fuck what
no ones getting out of here alive
im going to make it
the cynical brown just shakes his head
sure you will
tuning the brown out turning his attention to they say you only got three battles left til you get out
kable says nothing
the camera pushes in on a tattoo on his forearm a simple outline of a black box with the words inside i am right here music aldo nova life is
just a fantasy kicks in
a spartan underground lab
a plain clothes tech sits on a stool holding a simple remote on the table next to him is a small metal dish
in front of him floating in the air is one of the little metallic he pokes at it it instantly jukes left again it jukes right
almost faster than the eye can follow
no way he could ever touch it
semi satisfied he holds out the metal dish and clicks the remote
the fly drops into the dish clink
close up the little gunmetal ball is black and dented on one side probably the one we saw get knocked out of the air
there is a pinhole glass lens on the other end
the tech picks it up with thumb and forefinger and holds the lens up to his eyes
switch to pov of the fly cam the techs face extreme wide angle examining
the image flickers glitches then cuts to a console of monitors cut from fuzz to graphics
tech guys and producers scramble
counting down five
swish pan and snap zoom across the room through an open door to the corridor where
a reporter gina parker smith sexy eager beaver focused a news exec s and a chief of staff s are walking briskly along in a heated discussion
do we have the damn interview or dont we
were cunt hair close i cant blow off the three asian war for close
all respect bob nobody cares about dead orientals
they care about ken castle may i hear from gina please
gina spins on him looks chief straight in the eyeballs
you realize castle has clocked exactly one media appearance to date and that was walters last interview before she died nine fucking years ago
stop menstruating just tell me we fucking have it we fucking have it
the chief of staff bangs open a conference room door with his fist as they blow by veers off and disappears
gina rolls her eyes in disgust keeps moving
gina parker smith contd palindromes
she stops hold on
focus lets get lunch
sushi iranian or mexican
burger chili fry
considering ill freak a burger
freeze frame on gina zoom and
ginas burger freaking face becomes part of an animated title with gina parker smith in this context it looks like shes freaking serious world affairs
note this telecast will play much faster than the page count indicates hyped up quick cutting overlapping dialog a
and hyper caffeinated
there was society
shots of several dozen young trendily dressed people were talking trends that havent yet been invented wandering robotically around a backlot looking city street occasionally bumping into one another
the graphic society logo superimposed
voiceover contd the ultimate sim environment where players dont control virtual animated characters but actual living breathing human beings
people are dancing making out on street corners
someone tries to eat an ice cream cone misses his mouth and pokes it into his eye
voiceover contd quoting they walked them they talked them
they juiced them
a hot young girl in a wet t shirt is slamming a bottle of voiceover contd they rocked them
a middle aged guy in a shirt and tie is headbanging furiously like an extra in a twisted sister video
voiceover contd we all remember the slogan
switch to rows of people in front of wall sized video monitors transfixed doing a kind of sign language with their hands
japanese lining up around the block
college students and office workers glued to screens
voiceover contd the creation of reclusive genius ken castle society took the world by storm becoming the number one guilty pleasure of billions either playing or watching
and generating one of the worlds largest private fortunes surpassing steve jobs and bill gates practically overnight
a file footage clip of ken castle s fresh and boyish southern molasses accent being interviewed on a news show i aint complainin
freeze on castle
the image distorts in three dimensions offset red and blue channels shifting
nine months ago castle unveiled a new simulation one that would take gaming to new heights of thrilling excess
and controversy slayers logo over a slo mo shot of brown and blue soldiers walking towards camera badass with big motherfucking weapons slung at their sides
voiceover contd if society let us live thru others
slayers would let us die thru others
slick edited combat footage from the battlefield
explosions flame throwers bullet hits
dudes screaming unloading mass rounds
voiceover contd slayers gives the gamer full control of a flesh and blood human being in full scale kill or be killed combat
and when we say flesh and blood we mean flesh a quick cut of a browns arm being blown off
voiceover contd and blood
an rpg explodes chunks smack the lens and ooze down
castle is opposite gina parker smith both identified by translucent animated chyrons
castle is older now than in the earlier clip early s his body is more solid hair cut shorter conservative
but the eyes still sparkle
big smile slayers
castles accent is like pure georgia honey
hes a rock ribbed charmer
down to business why isnt it murder
she leans in playing the role of hard hitting reporter to a gina when was the last time you saw someone volunteer to be murdered
im sure you know that every last one of our slayers is a bona fide death row inmate points for emphasis each one offered a chance to participate as an
alternative to their sentence
stay alive for thirty sessions and get set free
thats not a bad god damned deal
i see and has any one of these men or women ever actually survived long enough to be set free
ken just smiles locks in on her eyes
id remind your audience that slayers was put together with the full cooperation and approval of the united states federal government
that the revenue it produces is responsible for funding our entire prison system keeping the bad guys behind bars
and that the prop was voted for by a cock solid of the american public
to board op whatd he say
in an election tainted by suspected digital fraud
changing gears lets talk about the so called generi cons
video a montage of slayers civilians the bum shaking a can in the midst of chaos a group of pedestrians walking robotically into a wall of flame store clerks air
gina parker smith contd sent into the slayers environment with a set of pre programmed actions with no way to react and no one controlling them their chances of survival
are next to nil
theres a lot of men and women in prison that could never cut it as slayers
shouldnt they have the same opportunity to roll the dice for a ticket out
besides they only need to survive one session
video the east indian female generi con from the first battle gets smeared by a truck
bullet cam images of a slayers soldier leaping into action and freezing in mid air a graphic superimposed throw to the live studio broadcast leaning in mr
castle how the hell does it work
a d animated graphic accompanies his explanation the virtual camera zooms in to the frozen soldiers head and then inside passing thru transparent layers
ken castle contd it begins with a single nano cell planted in the motor cortex of the brain this cell can replicate replacing the cells round it with perfect copies
we see a cartoon image of a tiny nano cell labeled with a bold block letter n
the nano cell approaches a normal cell next to it
there is a flash now the cell next to it has turned into an exact copy of the nano
this continues multiplying exponentially until we zoom back to reveal that the entire brain has been converted to nano cells
ken castle contd these copied cells contain remote access functionality
therefore nano plus cortex equals the nanex
the graphic zooms back further to show a pair of hands working a retro atari style joystick
animated waves indicate a wireless transmission from the joystick to the slayer who unfreezes and flies into action
geek geek geek come on castle you promised us a demonstration
castle smiles broadly
coy did i
you know i seem to recall that lets just see
castle waves in his personal security a half dozen geeks in black jeans black t shirts w white socks and sneakers backpacks
yes even fanny packs
a full range of geek variations beard mustache combos thick glasses pony tails etc
one geek brings out the cutest softest little spaniel puppy in the world and places it in castles lap
meanwhile several others are directing handheld sensors at gina and thumb clicking to establish tracking points her slightest movements are scanned and interpreted as data in real time
fighting it oh
you like her
her name is gina
shes a good little bitch
somehow in his sweet southern drawl this rolls off almost acceptable
the crew has a laugh off screen gina blushes
i beg your pardon
this motherfucker is off the charts
you realize he could buy our network
shrugs why would he
producer contd son of a bitch can pull million pay per views for a single broadcast
on the monitors castle is showing gina how to make the dog roll over sit up etc
gina has her hands up limp in front of her chin like a submissive puppy begging and she is panting shes clearly getting into it
her every movement is mirrored by the adorable dog
thats fuckin scary
more combat footage this time focusing on kable highlights
isnt it true that each human that undergoes the procedure will have a distinct ip address like a notebook computer or mobile device
but control is strictly localized to the parameters of our gaming environments
ken castle contd you take society for instance once a cast member leaves the workplace they are completely free from the control and monitoring of their player
incredulous thats a relief
teasing to some maybe
dont you suspect a good many folks wouldnt mind an itty bit of control
someone else making all the decisions for you
no responsibilities no tough choices
think about it
tough we will mr
a supernova flare throws to music and graphics a live back to handheld non broadcast reality
ken has ginas hand in his hand beaming
her demeanor has changed shes like a little girl with her dad at the fair
good little talk
shit can i tell you
wait for the next slayers
kable has been unbelievable
his arms are just so
well i know its awful
what the hell is that
the worldlink graphic glitches out replaced by a blue screen like an old school computer crash
then one letter at a time in retro apple chicago font accompanied by the exaggerated sound of computer keystroke
then a voice deep but speaking artificially quickly like in radio commercials where they use time compression software to remove the silences between the words
ken castle wants you to believe that you are living in a safer better world
hes a liar
mind control is slavery
we will all be his dog if we allow this evolution to continue
everyone in the studio is speechless watching the monitors including castle actually he loves it
hes laughing his ass off
castle we have no idea
on the screen the humanz logo dissolves bit arcade style replaced by underneath is the classic illustration showing the progression from primitive early man to the erect modern human
in a crude animation the progression continues modern man bends back over on his hands and knees in the final stage hes wearing a dog collar getting fucked in the
ass then fed through a meat grinder packaged sold as ken looks over at the producer
ken castle contd thats a god damn hoot
to his techies bypass orbital reroute from the backup servers now for christ sake you dirty apes
to castle sorry mr
castle we cant hard line a live broadcast
its impossible to stop every virus that sneaks in
you might wanna oughta let my boys take a look at your firewall
the screen cuts to black color bars blink then an advertisement streams in
ken stands holding ginas hand kisses it
ken castle contd to gina what about your firewall sugar wonder if i might breach it one of these sunny days
he gives her a roguish wink
on the monitors we transition back into a paid commercial a victorias secret porn looking girl in handcuffs turns to wanna blow off a little steam
a prisoner shirtless his upper body smeared with white powder screaming slams his fist down into face
blood sprays on white
we see that he is beating down a uniformed guard
the guard wears a black gas mask shattered and pouring blood
other prisoners shackled together stand by watching forming a half circle around the fight
they are shirtless covered in the same white powder they look like tribesmen
one of the prisoners very distinctive nods grimly clearly enjoying the show
fuck him up
the prison yard is a vast expanse of white it could be a chalk mine or the surface of a strange planet
distant towers mark the perimeter
other groups of shackled prisoners can be seen in the distance trotting along in lines
trails of thick magenta smoke snake across the yard sucked by the wind
the rogue prisoner stomps down on the guards face one last time his shoes are made of cloth
the guard stops moving
the prisoner starts to run for it across the white terrain
a group of guards appear to round up the remaining prisoners
they club them down with the butts of rifles but pay no mind to the fleeing rogue
they merely watch him go impassive
in a moment we see why when the rogue prisoner crosses between the two distant towers he is jerked to the ground by an invisible field
his body goes into spasms blood foams from his ears mouth eyes
fingers run through white powder making patterns
a black shadow crosses the frame accompanied by a low hum some sort of aircraft
kable looks up as the shadow tracks across him we never see the craft
he looks out across the yard
kable is sitting in what seems to be a minimal rec area cut out of the white terrain
he sits by himself wearing a white cloth hoodie eyes dark head down silent
across the yard a group of prisoners are playing basketball every single player is skying for dunks
we focus in on kables tattoo i am right here with you
in the yard a cripple his two legs stiff with braces walks robotically along on crutches
kable watches him expressionless
it triggers a memory
a little girl no more than two walks along on her daddys feet
her hands grip his big fingers
taking each big robot step with him
a basketball comes out of nowhere and knocks the crutch out from under the cripple sending him ass up on the asphalt
quiet conspiratorial kable
we see that kable has drawn the pattern in his tattoo with his finger in the white powder at the sound of the voice he runs his hand through it
wiping it away
a wiry jittery dude of indeterminate age is sitting next to kable
kable doesnt even turn to look
my name is tillman freak
tillmans yeah tillmans i knew that they said you names was tillmans
just sittin always sittin always lookin just lookin
like me i keep my holes down
you got to man
a dude inevitably start to break up start to crack and break up everyday never know you gonna die today or live another two three
you never do know
all these niggaz gonna snap snap snap one by one every last one all of em
yeah but not you
twenty seven battles and three to go
no one ever got that close before no one even done ten games without gettin they brains shot
but kable kable kable he just sittin lookin like he got a plan he already somewhere else he on a mission nothin get in his way never break never snap
never say shit just take care of his business niggaz get spooked by that shit
kable turns slowly to look him in the eye says nothing
freek contd spooky
kable looks away
freek contd why they put you in here tillmans
kable waits a good long beat
i killed my best friend
a prisoner sings metallica off key but balls to the walls master
master of puppets im pulling your strings twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
kable is alone in his cell
at the base of the single door is a sliding compartment to push food through it opens
but instead of a tray someone pushes through a wrinkled photograph
kable picks it up and looks a woman just a blur of golden hair laughing and a little girl
the same one in kables vision
you want to get back to them
kable is stunned silent
he sits on the ground shoulder leaning against the heavy door staring at the girl in the picture
contd its all you think about
its the only thing that keeps you alive
her words are like hammer blows to his guts he wants to weep but hes too strong too internalized
he steels himself
she pushes through a white notecard and pen
kable doesnt take it
my son david is your biggest fan
he prays for you
this takes kable by surprise he reluctantly takes the pen and card
he writes something on it and sticks it back through the slider
the woman stabs kables hand with a lancet she draws out a little blood
kable yanks his hand back out
contd need to prove its authentic
makes it worth more
why would anyone want my name
you dont even know whats going on out there do you
at the far end of the solitary block a buzzer sounds then the slide and slam of heavy steel
contd gotta go
kable jumps up and pulls himself against the door a lifeline is slipping away
he holds the wrinkled photo to the window how did you get this picture
have you seen them
he peers through the little window at the top of the door but shes gone
instead a group of prisoners are being led down the corridor to their new cells
we recognize grim battered faces from the yard these are the men that stood by as the guard was being beaten down
distinctive prisoner hands cuffed behind his back makes eye contact with kable as he walks by
a desolate white running track a guard tower overlooks
the field is empty but for one man kable
hes busting ass around the track pouring sweat
were right there with him close up profile full speed
we hear the hard breathing the feet pounding dirt like were wide lock off kable feet high a mural painted on the side of a building
its an ad for slayers kable in full combat mode cutting loose with a flame thrower
kable running were even closer now
hes pushing himself beyond exhaustion pure focus
different city same story kable a towering billboard projection
endless lanes of freeway gridlock sprawling beneath
kable staggering near collapse lungs burning
the iconic image of kable on the famous times square video wall now even more massive
the stock tickers reeling off disaster
hes like godzilla frozen amongst the kable finally flames out
he breaks down to a jog then doubles over hands on his knees gasping for breath
cut out wide kable is ant size and insignificant on the long barren field under a vast grey sky
hold for a long beat and
montage of gamers faces preparing to get it on
all shapes colors and styles but all rich and powerful looking
some are sweating some calm some beat red others have guitar playing twitch faces
shock cut into the heat of battle
kable blasts through a cloud of exploding debris
a brown to his left is blown in half the legs ted nugent in brown camo lines up a blue sniper in a rd story window with a cross bow
he releases the arrow and pins the blues head to the window sill
damn i gonna have to eat you now son
an upside down car comes sliding down the street on its hood and slams into ted nugent vaporizing him
another five blue soldiers are taken out
their bodies drop to the ground gruesome goodness
the five ball bearing cameras quickly flock together and check out each body as a swarming unit
from a wider shot they look like flies on shit
after checking out the recently deleted they zip off towards the closest save point
fifty beer slamming college students are going berserk
theyve got slayers on a wall sized screen pay per view
theyre high fiving smashing up the place
kable leaps for a drainage trench makes it and hustles around the back of a burnt out building
up a stairway the ghost face on glass superimposed on the image the face is laughing giddy
kable takes up a spot from a second level vantage point from here we see a small group of blues moving down the block scanning for survivors
wul hello thar
kable watches himself switch turrets on his weapon
he brings up a sniper sight and locks in on a target
voice contd wait for it
close up of kables ear just then he hears the subtlest of sounds creeping up behind
whoevers controlling him doesnt seem to have noticed hes too focused on the enemies in the sights
we can see the tension in kables face hes helpless trying to fight it willing his player to take notice
whispering turn me around god damn it
whatd he say
a trickle of sweat runs down into kables eye
the sound is more distinct now closer
hes practically shaking from the struggle to overcome the control
pov someone has reached the top of the stairs
kable seen from behind comes into view crouched by the blown out window
voice contd my boy gotta take a piss or something
finally snap zoom on a reflection in a shard of hanging window glass the outline of a blue raising his gun
voice contd doh
kable spins fast
the turret is already revolving when he squeezes the trigger
the armor piercing shell takes sneaky blue by surprise blowing him out the back of the building
the blues in the street take notice
its a matter of seconds
kable makes a run for it as the floor starts to disintegrate behind him in a shitstorm of bullets
shrapnel drills his back absorbed by the body armor
he hits daylight and turns a corner in time to see a group of browns scattering
a live artillery shell skitters across the pavement belching smoke
kable is running
he looks to his right a frozen moment the save point up ahead on the spinning railroad
the moment passes kable looks back over his shoulder a rush of roaring flame is coming fast
at the moment of impact we soldiers are charred bleeding wasted
a brown is sobbing uncontrollably
who are they
who the fuck are they
whos playing us
kable watches him wondering the same damn thing
two fat slices of whole grain bread check
big sloppy spoonfuls of lumpy green organic pistachio butter spread on slice a check
welchs purple grape jelly spread on slice b check
simon pale and lanky unkempt shaggy hair wearing a vintage guns n roses t shirt from the appetite for destruction tour walks down a long high ceilinged crystal hall with
marble floors macking on the sandwich
passes through a glass tunnel running through the interior of a massive exotic aquarium hes alone in what appears to be a vast cold mansion
simons room is simple four walls and a ceiling each one a d corner to corner video screen
the hd level of the screens is virtually absolute the flesh and blood simon himself is just another element in a high dollar high tech the floor is all bed
simon pads in takes a spinning stunt jump and rolls onto his back in a big ass pile of pillows sandwich intact
the screens are a jumble of floating frames competing for prominence in the d space
muted vid chats stock tickers sports scores ultraviolent slayers playback etc
everything dynamic everything moving
one whole wall is apparently a real time monitor of the slayers battleground with updated statistics
points leader frag count we notice that kable leads these categories a video loop of kable in action beside his name illustrates the point
in the forefront of simons attention a set of dynamic frames allow him to scroll through a series of revolving images weapons equipment body armor
simon interacts with the d environment using hand gestures he can slide squeeze pull and scroll the images just by moving his fingers in the air
he flips past various transformers looking super guns
he stops on an animated graphic
a sexy female voice breaks it all down for us swarmers
the latest innovation from browning this self detonating cartridge offers the widest and deadliest spray available from a full tracking cornering ordnance
a video demo shows the fired cartridge split into two dozen smaller shells that flash out like a swarm of bees wind around a corner and utterly shred a test
an annoying girls voice pops in along with a vid chat screen that takes over the main wall
she looks about skinny skanky kind of hot
fan girl stop hacking
if i want you unmuted ill unmute you
you suck simon youre going to get my boyfriend killed before he can get out of jail and fill me up with his hot seed
another girl cute stoned chimes in
simon i just wanna play you
forget about that star fucker
shut up bitch
simon casually waves his hand at the frame like flicking at a fly annoying girl is wiped away bringing cute stoned girl to the forefront
when can i meet you for like reals
simon notices a metallic sparkle from the girls tongue
what is that
like a dentist aaaa
he reaches out and pinches the screen zooming in close as she sticks out her tongue it fills the wall
a dozen wicked looking black tongue rings stud the wet pink flesh simon contd woah
he quickly unsqueezes zooming back out
the girls eyes are rolled back in her head euphoric shes wasted
you like me
a third girl pops in filling the opposite wall
whats up loser
this is simons sister shelly
frosted up lips eyes and hair like a tokyo hooker
mom says let me see go to college move the fuck out and
oh yeah youre a sick retard youre pathetic and you smell like jeffrey dahmer
wanna make out
i cant wait til they cut you off simian
with a wave of his hand he wipes her image off the screen
two more video chats pop up twin year old girls stupidly hot
star struck oh my god its really you
suddenly all of simons screens are filled with the twins
in unison do you wanna see our tits simon
shrugs uh sure
they lift their shirts girls gone wild style
perfect perky cs with silver dollar nipples
mmmmm now that we have your attention heres another offer you cant refuse
here we go
when twin speaks it is with a mans voice
the accent is fifty million euros for control of kable instant transfer to the account of your choice
question do i look like i need the money
weve discussed this before kable is not for sale
feeling herself up baby
make it a hundred
its been real
simon snaps his fingers all the windows close simultaneously
simon makes a clicking sound with his tongue in the new silence
peace at last
by themselves the screens come back to life
simon contd doh
the instant chat boxes are gone replaced by a soundless grainy video loop there is something sinister about the lo fi image
it looks like the feed from an old surveillance two men are sitting in a room
its silent but one of them seems to be screaming he lifts a gun
simon contd what the fuh
waits a beat
and shoots the other man in the head
black blood pools
this is real
the loop repeats
when the shooter turns his face toward the camera simon freezes the frame with a gesture and zooms in
a message is typed across the screen one letter at a time we may recognize the retro chicago font from the humanz video prank earlier want to talk to him
then blinking lo fi in the lower right corner of the wall walkietalkie
exe simon contd um
music bloodhound gang the bad touch ha ha well now we call this the act of mating but there are several other very important differences between human beings and animals
that you should know about
you and me baby aint nothin but mammals so lets do it like they do on the discovery channel
pavement flies by
sun slams rainbow flares into the lens
roller skates break frame outpacing us
were cruising along with a group of young beautiful people skating like robots through a city park
roller dolly follows hot girls in daisy dukes knee socks and tube tops belly rings and tatoos in the small of their backs
athletic dudes shirtless gun racks and six packs
they swing their arms mechanically identically
synced with each other and the beat of the soundtrack
each face plastered with an absurd exaggerated grin
lets fucking we are in a super saturated world
not virtual animated but absolutely real yet the color and immediacy of it is heightened off kilter
on the grass a gang of tokyo pop punk rockers are having a water battle blasting and soaking each other with big plastic water cannons like something out of slayers
a redhead soaking wet is feeling up her own breasts totally oblivious to her surroundings
one of the skaters out of control plows right into her at full speed
the skater takes a ride on concrete grinding flesh off her bare legs
she wobbles to her feet eyes streaming tears but still grinning ecstatically
a guy in a priest outfit holding brightly colored helium balloons looks on impassively then spots something of interest and breaks off sprinting full speed
people are dancing the corniest moves ever
making out on the ground
and in the middle of it all
close up a sparrow is pecking at a hunk of orange and yellow pop out wide to reveal that the bird is eating out of a this is angie blonde
micro mini skirt fishnets boots
green eyes haunted with sadness behind them pretty the clothes dont quite match her its like someone dressed her up as a hooker
she doesnt seem to notice the little bird munching away she stands in the middle of the park looking around lost
she spots a guy standing by himself near a giant sculpture
she walks over to him the bird flutters away
the guy is young and attractive dressed in casual business attire
he is wearing a plastic pig snout on his face tied with an elastic band
he smiles like a drivers license photo
close up of lips profile by the looks of it an overweight male
the room is dark lit by the ambient glow of a video screen
angie echoes practically overlapping
we will continue to cut between the two locations
so whats your damage
angie strikes an exaggeratedly demure flirtatious pose then immediately snaps back to neutrality
you know just hanging out
beat looking to meet people
a close up of lips to match gorges but facing the opposite direction
an extremely butch masculine female trace of a mustache
you met me
echoing you met me
angie laughs a beat late
across the street a woman has hiked up her skirt squatted down and is taking a pee on the sidewalk
looks her up and down i like your fur
do you want to go somewhere
she strikes the same flirty pose for the second time
we are somewhere
he winks reaches out and puts a hand on her waist
they start to make out like teenagers at the prom
dale guy lifts up her skirt with one hand and squeezes a boob with the other
he turns her around and presses angies back up against the base of the sculpture rough hands all over her inside her slobbering down her neck and shoulders
angie just looks straight ahead
her eyes move to a nearby building the side is an animated billboard that has switched to a promo for slayers with kable featured prominently
she watches kables face move
she lets out an involuntary moan that is more like a whimper
dale guy contd thanks for vagina
recreating an internet style video shock prank the screen goes dead and another blue screen of death another message society is rape slayers is murder humanz we get our first
wider view of the room
much more cramped than simons room
like simons the room is dominated by a giant video screen but just the front wall
there are other smaller paper thin screens mounted in various spots and leaning against walls garbage and tech gear all over the floor
gorge late s morbidly obese is contained by a massive automated rolling chair like the escalade of rascals
the humanz message has taken over his screen and hes going fucking ballistic throwing shit at it and gesturing crazily to the wall mounted motion sensors with his hands trying
to get the image back
its not happening
a new video prank by the subversive group humanz caused a nationwide stir today
the tv report continues on screen where a news host is backed by a graphic showing the society is rape screen with footage of exaggeratedly confused frustrated players theyre like
the actors in infomercials who cant manage to peel a potato without losing their shit
all contact between society city and an estimated quarter of a million players was shut down for over three hours while castle techs worked to remove what they described as
a satellite infection
a tree lined sun dappled mountainside whisks by as feet work the pedals of a mountain bike were moving around mph
castle is cruising downhill in a degree three dimensional environment that looks absolutely real except that he is on a stationary bike and the news report is floating in the
air as a d window
he is wearing skintight tour de france style gear and slurping a smoothie one hand on the handlebar the other holding the cup
female news host contd experts estimate that the service interruption may end up costing k soft billions in lost revenue
dont cry for castle he can cover that with the change under his couch cushions
on a personal note that shit was fucking freaky
oh i literally pissed myself
sounds like fun
serious these humanz cocksuckers are getting out of control and someone should do something
moving on to international headlines
castle closes the window in his fist
the scream would be comical if it werent so horrific
with a dozen cons looking on an asian prisoner is on his knees fingers deep into the back of his own skull
he rips into his brain stem with a tiny piece of busted razor hoping to pull out a chip a wire anything
he pulls out something and drops like a sack of potatoes to the floor fried potatoes
he lands on a couple of dumbbells his head smashing into the weight bench spinal cord severed
kable looks on impassive emotion internalized
guards push through
what the hell happened to this one
an old black dude lifer answers
look like he escaped
the guards roll their eyes drag away the body
back to your jazzercise girls
across the room kable notices a new guy a mean looking sunofabitch
in fact if murder were personified it would look exactly like hackman
hackman stares straight at kable
there is something in his ghost of a smile that says hed be more than happy to eviscerate you
its off putting to say the least
freek is there
who the hell is that
new dude new dude
they say he killed a whole mess of people all kind of people
one day he just walk up and turn himself in like he wanna be inside or some shit
never gonna run out of slayers long as they got that kind of motherfucka run around kill a mess of people
now hackman is looking at kable dead blank
a guard comes up behind hackman and shoves him
hackman turns the guard gestures him to follow
kable turns to look
hispanic guard contd lets go
kable and the guard are ant sized in what looks like a massive driving range
virtual targets are holographically projected in mid air at various heights and distances
other prisoners are there too a ways off well out of earshot
kable looks over a swarmer cartridge slams it into his weapon switches turrets takes a bead on a virtual target
we see him intentionally pan the sight off to the left of target he pulls the trigger click
the target and several others close by turns red blinks a hit
this thing doesnt just take out individuals it takes out who aims
caught off guard what
or the player
kable narrows his eyes focuses across the field where other prisoners are being briefed and upgraded
he spots hackman
not much to aiming
its just hand eye coordination
im the hand
someone somewhere else is the eye
kable glances at the guard
he struggles part of him feels like hes talking too much but he cant help being grateful for the human interaction
they take over you know completely
they move you
like a robot
beat but it doesnt work so good
that parts just for show
you cant really fight that way
theres a delay
yeah the ping
they talk about that
the time it takes the slayer to respond to the command
its like five millisecond ping eight millisecond ping
kable gets a bead for a headshot on hackman
whatever you call it
a slice of a second is the difference between living and dying out there
when the trigger pulls he pulls the trigger a meaty click
kable contd its just me
kable is alone toweling off privilege of being a top we see now the damage his body has taken he is covered in dark ugly bruises from bullet hits the
body armor has absorbed including a flinch inducing cluster of black blue and yellow from the most recent session
from down the row of lockers a whisper hey
kable turns to look
hackmans head is poked out sideways from around the corner hes maybe feet away
he brings his hands out where kable can see them they are hackman contd contd i just deleted someone
hackman is almost giggling high on it
hackman contd contd this is the blood
hackman rubs his slippery hands together relishing it he nods his head toward the area behind the lockers
to call the situation creepy would be a serious understatement
hackman contd hes back here
want to see
your head aint on straight
hackman cracks his neck
kable pulls on his prison greys quickly refusing to make eye contact
im going to delete you too
thats why they put me here
kables eyes narrow what
hackman disappears he starts to move along an adjacent row of lockers slamming the doors singing fucking pinocchio hackman contd ive got no strings
so i have fun
im not tied up to anyone
theyve got strings but you can see there are no strings on me
kable tenses up ready for instant violence
hackman contd you got two whores kable
if he didnt have kables attention before this got it
the fuck did you say
on the outside
oh im sorry i meant your pretty girls
you want to get back to them but im going to visit them first
kable is instantly all business hes going to make hackman disappear right the fuck now
he jams around the corner but hackman is nowhere to be seen
past another row of lockers nothing
where the hell is he
kable slams a fist into a locker busting it off its hinges
the camera angle on hackman begins to switch perspectives and spin around as though someone is manipulating it in three dimensions
hes so perfect
snap out to reveal castle in a dark lounge the walls and ceiling are pure black making it impossible to tell the dimensions of the room
minimalist expensive looking furniture is scattered around
theres no one else in the castle is standing bare feet on white shag carpet
he is manipulating the image of hackman in the air by pulling squeezing twisting with his hands the interface is similar to the one in simons room
castle is as pumped as a kid on christmas morning
then from behind him hes scary
we see that a perfect double of castle himself has appeared in the room behind him
he changes the angle on hackmans mug to give a better view then turns to face his double
castle contd proudly the new face of slayers
pure crystallized horror two stories tall and covered in bloody red
beat hes so what they want
playing dumb but they love kable
another castle appears to castles left
castle faces them
unaffected they do now
but when my boy kills their hero right there in front of their eyeballs so vivid its like you can reach out and feel the wet flesh trust me theyll
change their point of view
how can you be sure
its human nature
theyll be seduced by the power the violence
shaking his head guess we never figured on kable blowing up as big as he did
bigger than the game
then again who ever wouldve imagined a player could last over a dozen sessions with the same i con
tillman is a perfect soldier a tactical killing computer you dropped him in with common murderers
what did you expect
musing his instincts give him an edge
and in the hands of a talented player
of course we can never let him out
not after what we did to him
tell me again why we dont just get rid of the problem
makes a throat slashing motion you know off camera
castle pokes a finger at castle
you lack a flair for marketing
the people would never accept that
they need to see their gladiators brought down
one thing i know is what makes people tick
suddenly the room has gone dead silent
we swing the camera around to reveal that castle is all alone in the room
he stares into the void calm and utterly in control
the camera moves past his head into pure black
the black of the underground tunnel
the tunnel lights streak past like vanishing stars
train tracks blur by
kable is sprinting down the tunnel towards daylight
the voice comes from the rear surrounds kable dude
kable shakes his head thinking hes hearing things
beat im playing you dummy
kable knifes through the tunnel exit
we are in the over the shoulder pov of the fly cam as kable breaks daylight and slides down the hillside
superimposed over the image simons reflected face
the camera pans centers and focuses in on the reflection
sniper bullets whistle by kable ducks rolls
the camera past the flesh and blood simon into an over the shoulder simon controlling kable playing him as
kable lands in the rockstar pose
simon mirrors him in front of the giant screen whatever simon does kable echoes
kable makes it to cover heart slamming
we hear the distant thumps of mortars launching
how come i can hear you
its a mod
gamers cant talk to cons
simon pop locks the breakdance arm wave
its cool yeah
kable finishes the pop lock its goofy
a shell impacts the dirt nearby and blows a massive crater in the firma kable shields himself from the raining debris and scrambles for better cover
pay attention to the game
they spot another brown advancing toward a group of buildings simon moves kable to join him
just as kable gets there a blue kicks out a door and opens up with an assault shotgun shredding the brown
two more blues pop out of a ditch on the opposite side kable rolls big ammo displacing the air just inches above his head and blowing out the windows tires
of an abandoned car behind him switches turrets and comes up firing
armor piercing shells boom
minus three blues
in quick cuts we see simon striking badass poses on the d screen kable echoes them its like a synchronized dance
kable keeps moving he passes a blue on his knees in the mud the blue has completely lost his shit
this is real this is real this is real
kable doesnt bother to shoot him hes unarmed
a caliber shell connects from somewhere distant and the blue is vaporized a smear on the pavement
that was sick
wait a minute
are you twelve
this is unbelievable
how am i not dead yet
cause im a badass motherfucker
kable doesnt even register this
his darting eyes pick up a familiar face in the chaos freek
freek has apparently volunteered as a generi con he is dressed as a postman pulling a cart of mail behind him as he walks across the street
mumbling gotta keep my holes down
keep em down
freeks gonna make it gonna cut gonna scatter
gonna burn this joint
it all happens too quickly a brown scrambles behind freek and ducks down using him as a moving human shield squeezes off a few shots freek is chopped up by
incoming gunfire the brown keeps running
theres nothing kable can do
an explosion nearby pushes them forward
kibbles and bits
burning these are real humans fucker
death row psychos so what
they had it coming
an exposed concrete stairwell leads into the bowels of a collapsed building it looks like it mustve gotten the oklahoma city treatment in the early s
but theres still juice feeding the dim fluorescents
kable makes his way down
a distant voyeurs pov maybe a snipers telescopic sight
observes kable disappearing underground
guess that goes for me too
yeah but youre different
dude i dont know
cause youre my psycho
he emerges in an underground parking level
forty or fifty cars and suvs lie dormant covered in dirt dust and debris
kable switches on a light built in to his weapon
the fly cam scans degrees independent of kable giving them two sets of eyes
damn new area
kable nods toward an exit at the opposite end marked p
they make for it
think about it kable all the shit weve been through together
what an epic run
beat its going to suck to see it end
are you kidding me
well yeah i get that for you its different
kable emerges several blocks from where he started on a narrow block that seems distant from the heat of combat
buildings shelter the street on either side
several blocks down a low wall blocks the road marked with red diagonal stripes and a warning restricted
we should go that way
theres nothing there
kid trust me i was going house to house in tehran while you were still sucking mommys nipple
sarcastic uh yeah dude thanks for the visual but its a restricted area
its beyond the borders of the game
i couldnt put you there if i tried
kable just grunts his eyes steal a last look down the block
they head the other way
close range a big ass armor piercing mortar shell passes in time stops kable sees the shell moving through the air an inch from his nose in ultra slo mo
his cheeks ripple from the displaced air
then real time we whip around to follow the mortar as it whistles into concrete and blows out the front of a building
kable is running
shit shit shit
he rolls behind a crushed riot van and opens up in the direction the shell came from ash and debris from the impact still raining down
and then from behind hes nailed in the back by a swung length of iron pipe
he half crumples spins hackman
hackman swings again knocking the weapon out of kables hand it skitters across the concrete
simon is completely freaked its happening too fast no time to react
he tries to engage hand to hand but every move pings a step late
kable swings a fist hackman dodges easily
hackman is moving too naturally as if hes under his own control
hackman slams the pipe off the side of kables head dropping him then tosses the pipe away
and pulls out a nasty high tech looking shotgun
he stands over kable and points the barrel at his face
friendly bye kable
he squeezes the trigger
the submarine alarm sounds
floodlights crank up
the leds on hackmans gun power down with an audible down cycle
a shell undetonated drops from the barrel and plops onto kables forehead
hackman contd what happened
a brown con walks slowly on unsteady legs out of the octagonal save shack profile
dudes look at him and back away
when he turns toward us we see why half his head shoulder and one arm are blown off
kable seizes the opportunity to jam a foot up into hackmans balls buckling him
he twists hackmans legs into a pretzel and throws him off
to himself kids gonna get me killed
kable sees guards appearing and blues hurrying away from ambush positions including the one who likely fired the mortar
kable cups a hand over his mouth conspiratorially and speaks directly into simons ear listen to me
i dont know whos behind it or why but i was supposed to die today
theyre gunning for us
i can beat them but not with you controlling me
what the hell
this is unthinkable dangerous talk
turn me loose kid
you want to win turn me loose
but find a way
a guard grabs kable and the link breaks we
a drab brownstone apartment
shades block out the oppressive nicotine sunlight the interior is mute faded claustrophobic
kable has his cell even though angie is on the outside and free her environment seems to parallel his
a worn out photo is taped to the fridge the same little girl in kables picture
she stands in front of a closet mirror in the bedroom looking herself over
shes fully dressed
but not like we saw her in society
she rehearses a friendly smile but has difficulty not breaking into tears
animated colored light leaks in from outside through the dark window blinds behind her some sort of projected advertising
cut to same room later
angie sits on the unmade bed
she searches through her purse for a pill jar rattles a few into her hand
she dry swallows them
leans forward eyes shut struggling not to pass out
she has to pull herself together somehow
the camera pushes past her toward the window where the animated colors play
the camera pulls away continuing the motion we are on a wide view of the outside of the building a rundown brownstone on a rundown street animated advertising covers half
the side of the structure
an ad for slayers is running kable in cinematic slo mo and superimposed in wall height block letters and then
angie sits uncomfortably in a hard plastic chair the light is flat fluorescent
in front of her behind a desk is a no nonsense social services caseworker late s cuban
looks over her paperwork so
angie delivers the smile we saw her rehearse with all the warmth she can muster its not convincing
caseworker contd why are we here today
says youd like to apply for custody of your child delia
her name is delia
the caseworker looks over the paperwork while angie shifts in her seat
spouse incarcerated life without possibility of parole
you use your maiden name
my husband he
its not entirely true regarding his sentence
in fact hes due to be released soon
she makes brief eye contact with angie
your husband was charged and convicted of first degree murder miss roth
i can hardly consider his release if it was to occur to be a positive
this is not going well
angie holds her tongue with all of her will not wanting to make it worse
the caseworker holds all the cards
caseworker contd changes subject back at the paperwork youre
caseworker contd not sure if ive seen you in anything
i work in society
acting is that what they call it
its a job
angie is hanging on
be pleasant be friendly breathe
but inside she wants to cry to scream to fucking explode
your child has been
exceedingly well placed
the new family is very wealthy
shell never want for anything
leans in i understand you love your little girl but
do you really think shed be better off with people like you
yes i do
im her mother
the caseworker presses a buzzer unlocking the door behind we will give your application all the consideration that it merits
the words burn into angie like battery acid but theres not a thing she can say
simon is lying on his bed staring at the ceiling a giant video screen playing back key moments of that days slayers session in an endless loop
simon holds his fingers up in front of his face zooming and rewinding the video with little fluid movements of his hands
suddenly the screen glitches out goes dead for a second and when it comes back the battle images are replaced by a giant face surrounded by black staring down at
him humanz brother early s a savvy leader with an unforgettable presence
his style is a throwback to another era like a s black panther soul brother transplanted into the high tech future
you like the software
the walkie talkie playa
simon puts it all together
youre the guy from tv
thats right baby
you think about what the brotha said
to what um brotha do you refer
kable wants the freedom to ass kick
do shit his way
you gonna give it to him
you were listening
we see and hear everything that goes on inside the so called game
considering kable said we got lucky that they were gunning for us what was that all about
kable got a past
he knows things
things he dont even know he know
things castles afraid of
as long as your boy stay on the inside castle know he can keep him quiet but if ever got out
shakes his head uh uh
castle will never let that happen
one battle left i think i can handle my bidness
humanz brother just shakes his head
youre not hearing me this is not something you can control
they gonna kill his ass simon
in the eyes of the world
and then what
you just another poor little rich honky
no kable no pussy no shit
simon cant deal
this is come on
i dont know what the hell youre talking about
i just play games man
thats right its a game
changing gears you want to win it dont you
yeah dude i intend to
then you need to cutcho strings puppet massa
humanz brother slowly zooms himself in
humanz brother contd imagine a slayer that dont got to wait to be told what to do
no ping you dig
a trained killing machine
operating in real time on pure instinct
simon cant help but consider it mind reeling
its obvious kable would royally fucking dominate but
simon shakes it off
would be cheating
a mod thats all
like that guidance system you hacked on three weeks ago lets you track motherfuckers around corners and shit
the game got to mutate after all
it got to evolve you feel me
i do feel you
humanz brother leans back he has him
then lets rock baby
music twisted sister i wanna rock kicks in a window pops up on the screen freenigga
exe i wanna rock continues
hackmans face glistening with sweat is the only thing partially visible in the inky black
the camera slowly zooms into his eyes
twin pools of madness
of close up of the faded photo
gold hair innocent laughter
kable runs his thumb across it tenderly caressing the lines
kable looks up
its the same voice as before the one that gave him the photo
we know you talked to him
youre not a guard
who are you
i dont have any
listen to me simons going to give you what you want
what you asked him for
how do you know that
i know something else whether or not hes controlling you you will never reach the save point
castle wont allow it
listen to me tillman the game is unwinnable they will not let you live
if youre want to get out and see the people in the picture youll have to find another way
kable doesnt answer he absorbs her words wondering if he can believe them
finally i need you to get me something
what can i get you
kable stares into the dark turning it over in his head then looks up at the window in the door a simple black rectangle and on the other side his
overhead fluorescents shock and hum to life revealing a claustrophobic room four walls metal grating underfoot and a locker
kable is in his combat brown
he print activates the locker
the weapon is there
and something else a wrinkled brown paper bag
what the hell
he takes it out trying not to glance too obviously at the overhead surveillance camera
cut to the pov from the cam kable is opening the bag
whats he got there
back in the room
inside the brown bag is a fifth of vodka
kable quickly slips it into his side cargo pocket
voice contd kable what the hell is that
behind kable a door slides open automatically revealing a concrete tunnel like the players entrance to a football stadium
the white light is blinking on and off
soldiers sprint for the daylight trying to escape the torture
its voice contd fuck face remove the molotov from your pants and discard into the recycle bin now
kable grabs the bottle from his pocket struggling to maintain as the light slams into his brain agony
all surveillance cameras point at kable
kable no choice makes the decision twists the cap tilts his head back and he wails the bottle at one of the cameras shattering it and joins the others rushing
kable breaks the daylight but without a smooth leap and roll and no rockstar pose instead he trips and tumbles ass over end down an embankment landing in a heap
at the bottom
sarcastic i can see turning you loose was a great idea
woozy what happened
you happened jackass
you wanted control you got it
kable tests his hands clenching and unclenching the kid wasnt lying
while starting to trip hard on the vodka which is kicking in instantly
yeah thats right
so please dont fuck up
an explosion rocks the dirt just a few feet away blinding deafening and kable shifts into another world
hes moving fast
sound is just an idea disconnected from reality
bodies and bullets drift by without gravity
his vision doubles and bleeds
whats the matter with you kable
lots of them
kable starts shooting wildly hitting
contd this is unbelievable
kable is running erratically at least
hard to hit
but definitely headed somewhere
a shell smacks kables shoulder knocking him off his feet the armor absorbs it but hes out of time
hes shooting air
frustrated fuck it
we see simons fingers glide dial up the swarmer
kable is still firing randomly as the turret shifts the swarmer goes straight up then locks on blue and swerves down on them like hell from the sky turning skulls
to swiss cheese
contd the voice of reason kable
listen its the last game
youre going to be dead and im going to look like a total asshole if you dont pull your balls together
he scrambles to his feet and charges for the entrance to the dammit
kable slams open a door marked p and stumbles into the car reality is roaring spinning
kable slams into the side of a parked car legs rubber
he looks it over tires flat no good
he stumbles to the next then another
his head hits a passenger side window
finally the one a ford f super chief
gun metal grey note the f is a concept truck a future design for fords f line
in our world this is a factory model which makes it old but not antique
the truck is about as badass as you could want with dark narrow windows big ass wheels and a front end that looks like it could punch through kable gets
to the fuel cap door and pries it open
engraved under the cap is a prominent warning ethanol only kable
what are you doing
kable unscrews the cap and sticks his finger down his throat
he does it again this time puts his mouth on the hole and pukes pure liquid into the tank
contd what the hell
he stops doubled over gasping for breath
then the feeling hits him again and he heaves another fountain down the hole
a blue shows up in the opposite stairwell kable brings his weapon up to hip level and blows him away without looking
his head is clearing
kable looks around unzips his pants and pisses into the tank
simon is slack jawed speechless
kable shakes out his head we can see in his eyes that hes regaining his senses focusing in
he busts out the drivers side window gets in tears open the steering column a blue slayer shows up in the mirror fuck
he cranks the booom
a mm shatters the back window and punches a hole into the dashboard
kable checks whats left of the mirror
hackman and six other blue slayers are coming fast
anything else ya fuckin cheerleader
kable hammers on the pedal again knocking out the old ghosts vrroooooomm
he slams it into gear and peels out
hackman leaps onto the side of the moving truck and points mm directly at the side of kables head
in a split instant kable grabs the nose of the weapon and points it up boom
a close range shell blows through the roof of the truck
kable slams the brakes spinning the truck and launches hackman into a row of parked cars
hackman gets in one last shot as kable punches it out of the garage disintegrating a concrete column
he slams his head into the windshield of a parked car caving it in
kable drifts the f onto the street sideways tires shrieking
wiping out two unlucky blues
pops it and he is headed straight into the restricted area
the fly cam is right there taking the hot turn right on the trucks tail giving simon the pov of a classic d driving game
he activates dynamic camera control with a gesture now he can manually choose his view
he pushes the camera forward next to the drivers window
the camera looks to the side at kable driving like hes on a mission to hell
simon barks in his head
get back in the game
youre screwing my ass kable ignores him he picks up his weapon points it out the window at the fly and fires
the fly jukes out of the way barely
it spins off out of control and smashes through the window of a building
simons screen is filled with a glitched out view of nothing under a pile of glass and concrete
the submarine alarm is sounding across the battleground
kable is heading deep into restricted territory slamming through and swerving around obstacles
without warning a snowplow comes blasting out of nowhere going trying to ram the drivers side
its a tick late clipping the back end instead sending kable into a spin
kable is knocked around in the cab and pukes all over the passenger seat
he recovers straightens out and keeps going
relieved ughh that was the one
simon is switching from camera to camera trying to pick up a view of kable
finally he comes across a rumbling chase cam coming up on kables truck from behind
the camera is mounted on a snowplow one of a pair gaining on kable slamming through rubble and debris
kable spots them in the rear view mirror
he slams his head against the steering wheel to clear it despite the purge hes still pretty fucked up
kable pops the drivers door and leans out getting a bead on the nearest plow
from the snowplows pov we see kable leaning out pointing the weapon at us
then big ass muzzle flashes thoom
shit shit shit
a shell comes right at us the screen glitches freezes and goes black
simon contd im dead
in kables rear view the lead snowplow spins out hemorrhaging black smoke then slams into the second sending it into the side of a building
kables truck hiccups fuel is on empty but still charging ahead
a low concrete wall surrounds the perimeter and its coming up fast beyond it more abandoned urban wasteland
kable has got too much speed at this point to do anything but slam the thing sideways into a sick power slide the truck hits the barrier and flips over
it corkscrewing four times before grinding to a stop on its hood
the airbags deploy smashing kable into his seat
kable scrambles out of the vehicle he spots a half collapsed subway entrance and runs for it
behind him two smart missiles are streaking high across the grey sky
they change direction and double their speed its fucking horrific
and converge on the downed truck in an eyeblink
kable is lifted off his feet and blown into the subway entrance which collapses behind him
the frat guys are standing there with their beers frozen mouths hanging open
on screen is a three dimensional test pattern accompanied by a sexy female voice please stand by
please stand by
please stand by
what just happened
the report plays on a variety of public screens to recap initial reports are that kable the most recognizable face of the slayers phenomenon next to ken castle himself is
officially listed as fragged
bitter thats bullshit
just one session away from being the first slayer ever to win a full pardon and release
a drab above ground commuter train somehow reminiscent of the train to the slayers battleground except the population here is strictly civilian young eccentric mostly attractive but their eyes are
burned out dead
dishwater daylight filters through the windows
the news broadcast continues fed over video monitors that line the ceiling of the train
the passengers eyes are glued to the screens
in a netcast plagued by technical difficulties and dead spots the report could not be confirmed however kable born john tillman of albany new york and convicted of murder just
four years ago has been removed from slayers rosters and upcoming events listings
including we reveal angie
she is stunned her eyes well up with tears
no one notices
female news host contd his player gaming megastar simon silverton could not be reached for comment
graffiti on concrete stenciled slayers is bad tv humanz kable is standing across the street from a beat down brownstone watching the second floor window
a funky off road motocross bike buzzes by him and up onto the sidewalk farting smoke
kable ignores the rider who parks gets off loses the brain bucket and steps up to his side
shes not home
kable turns the rider is a green eyed year old girl w black rimmed weezer glasses smart and cute as hell
this is trace
trace contd but castles personal security will be soon enough trust me you dont want to meet them
beat you know its pretty obvious that youd come here first
who are you
you asked me that once before
we might recognize it too its the voice from the other side of the cell door
you should really come with me
she glances skyward toward the sound of helicopters
trace contd like now
kable considers his options
they take off on the moto trace driving
trace darts nimbly thru traffic and pedestrians finally zagging up onto the sidewalk and down a side alley
theres an open doorway to the left neon sign above adult xxx video novelty toy she cuts hard degrees straight into it leaving tread on the concrete through hanging black
rubber strip curtains
and straight down a narrow stairwell taking the stairs she cuts hard right at the bottom
down a concrete corridor and onto a minimal freight elevator open on the sides
punches the down button bike still idling
kable coughs from the fumes
halfway down there is a square opening in the wall of the elevator shaft a tunnel to black
trace revs up the bike and as they pass the tunnel she pops it
a dark underground video arcade
low ceilings concrete old school sort of a graveyard of lost games
the classics of the s missile command defender robotron crank etc
the dimensions of the room are impossible to determine
a dozen or so people just black silhouettes in the cathode ray glow are scattered around banging buttons giving it body english racking up scores
trace leads kable through toward the one brightly lit spot at the center of the arcade an air hockey table is blasted with white light from above
humanz brother who we recognize from simons vid screen and humanz dude mid s long hair are playing clackclack click clackclunk they are so wrapped up in their game that
they dont appear to notice kable
humanz brother smacks a random bank winner
you a fool
stop playing that freaky shit off the rail
its a game of deception
whatever thats cuz you got no power
humanz dude measures a shot rolling the paddle with one finger then lets it rip slamming the game winner in a straight line past humanz brothers frozen paddle score
humanz dude contd getting in his face huh

they turn suddenly aware of him
humanz dudes paddle hand goes limp the puck limps in and scores meaninglessly

kable contd she took my blood
the nanex modifies the actual cell structure of your brain
humanz dude contd we can crack it but its not one size fits all we needed your dna to generate custom code

castle rides in on a white horse says he got a plan to bail us out and everyone just fall in line
so whats next
the health care system is collapsing castle comes to the rescue again
this time hes pushin total control of genetic disease
birth defects a thing of the past

theyll be standing in line to hand their babies over to him
next thing you know we all slaves
we cant let that happen
gotta bring the man down
you can help us tillman
with urgency you have to help us
kable takes this in and starts to walk away
i cant help you
kable ignores him hes out
but humanz brother freezes him in his tracks humanz brother contd we know where she is
simon is in a stark interrogation room alone drumming his fingers on the table thumb to pinky pinky to thumb
trying not to show how scared he is
the door clicks open and several men enter
we only see them from behind not their faces simon nods waddup
the seated man pushes several photos across the table to simon
simon glances at the top photo as casually as he can manage it shows simon in an mtv trl type setting being interviewed in front of a live audience of
when agent keith speaks he is calm conversational
guess you remember that day
simon nods noncommitally
agent keith contd youd just gotten kable through his tenth consecutive session alive
no one ever thought an i con could last that long
another photo shows simon on a jumbotron posing with his fingers in the cameras face throwing the motion control hand signal for fire and kill
in another hes being mobbed at an event signing an amazing pair of breasts with a black marker
agent keith contd pretty hot shit arent you
on the outside
now look at these
a new series of graphic photos show bloody mangled remains the aftermath of a slayers session
agent keith contd this is what its like on the inside
beat wonder how long youd last on the other side of the screen
this sits in the room for a beat simon considers several responses chooses none of them
agent keith contd simon youre being held today suspected of aiding in the escape of a convicted murderer from a maximum security penitentiary
the charge is
your hard drives have been seized forensics is decrypting the contents as we speak
your internet activity over the last ten years is being scrutinized and catalogued in minute vivid detail
simon flinches at this one
agent keith contd in addition your fathers bank accounts have been frozen pending further investigation naturally seeing it was his money that essentially funded mr
beat im going to need you to tell me everything that happened leading up to yesterday afternoon
everyone you talked to everything you heard everything you did
i need you to do that
i need something too
ice cold do you now
and what might that be
simon swallows hard
could you dudes do a sandwich like peanut butter almond butter walnut butter
pecan butter pistachio butter
pretty much any kind of you know nut butter
and welchs grape
simon chews a hanging chad off of a fingernail
they make that
fat fingers squeeze air
angie in a white tank top and panties is pulled to d life size dimensions on gorges video wall standing impassively in space
a fat tongue wets fat lips
gorge scrolls through options
hair clothes makeup
from slutty to sci fi to quirky to casual and back to slutty
as he selects options they appear on angie rotating her in three dimensions to model shes a living breathing barbie doll
orange sherbet hair then a platinum white judy jetson ponytail
black cat suit daisy duke darryl hannahs punk replicant from blade runner
he chooses a look and locks it gorge lifts an oxygen mask to his face and breathes deep
he goes limp in his chair eyes rolled up in his head head clocked back to face the ceiling
bathed in sweat
the mask falls away
angie is on the sidewalk a little unsteady on high heels wearing the outfit gorge chose
other people are wandering around everywhere
a debutante type in a pink ensemble has a poofy shitzu on a leash the shitzu is pissing on its owners leg but she doesnt seem to notice
a taxi speeds by with four people crushed in the back seat having crazy animal sex
angie starts walking
she passes a familiar face who turns to watch her go without expression is that gina parker smith
angie walks around the corner to a bar and goes in
the thorax bar is small intimate but ultra styled
the theme is insect
all manner of exotic bug preserved in glass suspended in ice
one wall is a giant black lit ant farm
green glowing fireflies dart through the air
people lounge on plush seating gobbling up creatively prepared bug delicacies fried pink grasshoppers fat yellow grubs with red chili oil
angie takes a seat at the bar
she just winks flirtatious
the bartender returns a smile and shakes up an aqua blue martini
to finish he plops in a live white larva
it curls and twists in the liquid soaking the alcohol into its pulp
she takes a sip letting the larva curl around her tongue
swallows it down
as a guy takes a seat to her left his hair is shiny slick black licorice
rick rape right
in gorges apartment his lips move angies echoing to match
angie contd i thought you werent allowed to come here anymore
rick rape laughs throwing his head back and slapping his knee exaggerated
that was just last month
i was a bad boy
are you still a bad boy
angie exits the elevator on the rd floor a modern minimalist building
rick rape is with her close behind
they come to an apartment door rick rape pushes her from behind up against the door violent
her right hand slaps a palm identification sensor alongside the door and it angie snaps a heel they stumble in
angies place is some kind of overdecorated schitzophrenic blend of girlie geeky porn
shafts of nicotine sunlight filter through patterned curtains
she crawls along a plush white fur rug
rick rape follows
he licks his lips an automatic gesture and begins to unbutton his pants
angie on her hands and knees back to him doesnt even bother to look until
kable has rick rape up in the air holding him like a barbell with one hand crushing his throat the other his balls
he brings him down over his knee snapping him like a broken bat angies face is passive neutral
but her eyes are nuclear with emotion
kable tosses rick rapes broken body into the bedroom
then falls to his knees in front of angie and takes her face in his palms gently eyes locked into hers
gorge is paralyzed
please dont kill me
angie says the words but they dont match her eyes
kable just shakes his head trying to grasp the situation
gorge angie contd ill do anything
dont say that
gorge holds out his hands angies fingers caress kables chest and move toward his crotch
kable contd stop
he pushes her hands away gently
kable contd this isnt you
angies eyes well up with tears
kable contd trying to contain his god damn it
you in there
let her talk motherfucker
gorge swallows kable is staring straight into his eyeballs
kable buries his face in his hands its tearing him up
gorge angie contd she has to say what i tell her
kable looks deep into angies eyes
almost whispering you can hear me baby
i know you can
he wipes away a tear from her cheek with his thumb
after all hes been through he begins to break down
kable contd i love you
i love you too
snapping hes screaming directly at gorge who cowers in his chair as if kable were in the room with him
kable contd say anything else and ill find you
ill rip you to fucking pieces do you understand me
gorge angie nods
kable contd to angie im getting you out of here
kable pulls angie out the door and down the hall in tactical mode weapon ready
he heads to the elevator punches up a ride
no sign of trouble
quiet im going to take you someplace where they can turn it off
gorge angie says nothing
the elevator door whispers open hackman is standing there with an assault shotgun
friendly hi kable
kable takes it in the chest hes blown off his feet through a wall and into an apartment opposite the elevator
hackman grabs angies wrist drags her onto the elevator and waits a beat smiling pleasantly
the elevator door closes
kable is on his back in rubble
his chest is a black smoking hole
but as the smoke clears we see that his body armor has absorbed the blast
hes groggy in excruciating pain wind knocked out of him but alive
two guys in gas masks and rubber suits are watching him from the next room as he attempts to struggle to his knees kable has obviously interrupted something
hackman and angie are having a pleasant ride down hackmans hands folded in front of him patiently the shotgun still smoking shoulder strapped
to angie anybody in there
the elevator stops and picks up two passengers a giggling necking couple
the doors close
hackman gives gorge angie a wink and flashes a nine inch bowie knife carbon steel nasty
angies eyes go wide with terror
the couple is oblivious
gorge cant hold back the sick fuck he squirms in his chair sweating buckets feeling himself up
and when he speaks angie echoes come on
hackman raises his eyebrows he wasnt expecting that one
but he obliges
a flex of his shoulder the necking girls legs buckle under her and she goes down without a peep
the guy is confused whered she go
he looks to angie
hackman headlocks him from behind and slowly making eye contact with gorge angie the entire time snaps his neck
angies eyes stream tears gorge is in ecstasy
hackman lets the second body drop chuckling as the elevator kable is waiting
kable grabs hackman with both hands rips him out of the elevator and slams him into a wall
a brutal head butt to the face smashing bone
hackmans face erupts with blood
hackman swings blind with the bowie knife once twice the blade misses kable backpedaling by fractions of inches displacing some serious air
hackman lets it fly
the bowie whistles past kables face and thunks into the wall behind him four inches deep
hackman smears the blood from his eyes and brings up the shotgun but kable is quick instead of trying to move away he steps in pushing the barrel straight down
as hackman fires
the big hit puts a crater in the floor and takes out a set of hackmans toes
kable kicks the shotgun from hackmans hands and brings up his own weapon to close the deal
as the glass walls of the lobby explode
more slayers are moving in
kable releases a barrage of cover fire grabs angie and breaks for the back exit
kable and angie hit white hot daylight
a blue slayer breaks the corner of the building and kable frags him
kable grabs angie by the shoulders and yells directly at continuous shot gorge angie starts running across the street leading the way
kable takes out another blue at a distance following close behind her
they run into a generic unmarked building
the shot continues across the lobby through an anonymous grey door
and down a flight of stairs
muffled music is thumping getting louder
down a pink corridor and into
a hour underground rave in full effect
this thing is fucking huge
in the dark its impossible to tell just how big
hundreds of writhing society dudes chicks and other
day glo moving spotlights strobes
the bubble girls from crank make an appearance
along with the discovery channel skaters from the park now in gothed up kable gathers it all
he takes angies arm and begins to wade through the chaos
the blood spatters on his face pop in sharp inverse day glo like hartigans scar in sin a skater girl takes a hold of the glowing smoking barrel of kables
weapon and starts to skate circles around him ring around the rosie
he wrenches it hard sending her flying into a crowd that goes down like bowling pins
they continue moving
kable happens to notice red lasers moving through the dark
lightning flashes explosions
a raver nearby disintegrates blood and guts a day glo volcano
dancers slip and fall on their asses in the viscera
the slayers are moving thru the rave hunting
everyone but kable and angie are so out of it they dont even notice
to gorge you
kable goes commando evading the hunters ducking under exploding shit
he moves to flank them
the dj is decapitated by a stray caliber round but the lightning strikes freeze the action as kable engages the blues one by one
he takes out three of them with close range blasts and another hand to hand to headsnap then notices more blues moving in
he catches up to angie and they make for an exit any exit
they find curtains run past freaky chill lounges and smoke out rooms
kable blows a hole in a locked maintenance door and they duck out of rave world into
an industrial concrete corridor
muffled blasts screaming in the rear surrounds tell kable the blues are close behind
up more stairs they slam through a service door and back into
a scooby doo looking van pulls up to the curb in front of them the back doors swing open
i can get you out
not much choice
kable and angie climb in
the electric van drives quietly away attracting no attention
kable slumps against the wall of the van cradling angie in his arms exhausted
angies eyes are post traumatic searching
gina is pumped
i cant believe its you
gathering herself listen you can trust me kable
quietly if not
he looks her straight in the eye
kable contd youre dead
hes not lying
close up a lancet is prepared
it punctures skin and angie is lying on a black leather couch unconscious breathing deeply
trace pops the lancet out of angies fingertip and plops a red drop into a glass tube of liquid
kable kneels beside angie stroking her hair
humanz dude humanz brother and gina parker smith are all there
shrugs the crack works youre the proof
we put the dna in the soup light it up extract it then feed my girls sequence into the code and were good to go
thinking out loud its an anti spyware program
we cant quarantine the foreign cells per se but we can disable their ability to transmit and receive
ginas not buying this i
id make you cut it out of me
trace gives her a glance dumb bitch
that would be like cutting out part of your brain
trace contd the nanocells replace the cells they replicate
they become you
gina has no answer
how long will she sleep
were going to have to keep her sedated until we can kill the link
otherwise shes broadcasting everything she sees or hears
you give us a robot we give you back a super hot human
trace rolls her eyes
humanz brother contd we need to talk my man
primitive bit arcade demo screens missiles obliterate a city in missile command line vector tanks track d targets in battlezone etc
ken castle made his first billion designing virtual reality simulators for the us military
six years ago he brought them something new a breakthrough so profound he said that history would be divided up between everything before and everything that came after
humanz brother and kable walk through the dark arcade past rows of machines
the lights and patterns of bit demo sequences and hi score screens flash across their faces
humanz brother contd they tested it on soldiers
the first volunteer was corporal travis scotch a friend of yours i believe
the second was you
kable fights difficult memories
the idea was to replace your brain bit by bit cell by cell gradual
the new tissue would never break down never deteriorate
bitter a new era in human longevity is what they told us
we were doing the world a favor
nods nine weeks later scotch was dead and you were serving life in maximum
castles project was shut down
but the shit wasnt a total loss the same technology resurfaced within a year
in a game
castle called it society
thank you for the history lesson
dig me tillman
whatever happened in that project is something castle wanna be buried
we need that shit baby what you saw what you know
i dont know what to tell you
you aint gotta tell me shit tillman
beat i want you to show me
slow push in on unconscious angie
we hear trace interacting with humanz techs off camera as a heart monitor beeps steadily
were ready to rock
a sequence is punched in on a keyboard
contd lets transmit in three
with a gasp angies eyes snap open
gorges eyes snap open
he spazzes out like a turtle on its shell a moment of panic hes been passed out in his chair and doesnt immediately know where he is
he looks around the dark room nervously takes a hit of oxygen
on the screen society is gone there is only a nebulous behind him a sound
he runs his hand along the chairs trackball control it spins around and rolls forward a bit
castles geek squad is standing in the room silhouettes in the dark scary
gorge contd freaked what are you doing here
who are you
a screen glitches pixellated fucked up highly compressed like an internet feed through a busted satellite
we begin to make out a coherent image it is a pov walking of an industrial corridor
cameras mounted and doors with square glass windows
we back away from the screen to reveal humanz dude humanz brother and gina parker smith are watching the image on a lo fi computer monitor
humanz dude runs his fingers along a touchpad moving frequencies around on a waveform monitor trying to dial the picture in better
we see kable through an observation window slumped over in a chair
or just concentrating
what are we looking at
translated as raw audiovisual data
i read something about this
but that tech is supposed to be a decade away
humanz dude smirks shakes his head
current exponential rate of growth i cant imagine a piece of tech that will take that long to come around
he bangs on a key beating up the interface
humanz dude contd theyll have better shit than this in best buy within months
kable younger in uniform walks down a sterile corridor
he is dead calm emotionless
tiny surveillance cameras track his movements
he comes to a door it whispers open and he steps in
a white minimal room table two chairs
we may recognize it from the video the humanz sent to simon
in one chair a man s beard and mustache grown out thick in uniform
kable sits down in the other
never thought id be so glad to see your ugly grille
mimicking him scotch
back in character ill tell you what man this place sucks
on the computer screen scotch gestures to indicate the white room the facility
to kable grinning they got me hooked up to computers five hours a day
nurses feeding me vitamins giving me shots wiping my butt male nurses i might add
scotch chuckles conspiratorial
what about you
youre dressed like a semi human being
they let you out already
kables response doesnt match scotchs energy hes bland generic
im not getting out
confused beat tillman
are you good
you dont look good
kables sorry seems to refer to something only kable knows
hesitant making light well its not like you ever looked that good
scotch is suddenly conscious of the surveillance
kables eyes flicker away from scotchs
he calmly removes his military issue
from its holster and lets it rest on the table between them
he stares at it intensely emotion starting to seep through the icy lines of his face
scotch contd quietly tillman what did they do to you
the image on the screen begins to break up
hard to make out
humanz brother holds up a finger shhh
through the observation window we see present day kable jerk and spasm in the chair
kable starts to shake the gun rattles on the table top
a bead of sweat creeps down his forehead
its apparent that he is locked in a paralyzing internal struggle
a low hum in the room starts to swell and throb numbing disorienting
it seems to take all of kables strength to answer
his voice is halting human not robotic like before
i cant stop it
kables eyes meet scotchs they are red rimmed with tears
who are you
we punch in on a wall of two way glass behind scotch pixellated visual noise resolving to murky detail as we move in we punch through the glass to reveal
a familiar silhouette castle brings up his hand miming a gun
kable brings up the gun points it at scotchs forehead
scotch is too stunned to react
cut to the silent fixed surveillance cam footage that humanz sent to simon kable pulls the trigger soundless
scotch falls over
black blood pools
the humanz monitor goes dead
not the best commercial for k soft technology
gina parker smith is practically moist visions of monster ratings dancing in her head
you can say that again
bitter he made him do it
castle made him do it
everyones eyes had been glued to it now they look up through the observation window
the room is empty
the chair is knocked over on the floor kable is gone
kable is slumped against concrete on his knees
reliving the murder has knocked the hell out of him but hes dealing a pair of skinny legs walk up and kneel next to him angie
he touches her face looks deep into her eyes they are wet with emotion
she just nods
finally for real
i missed you
angie says nothing just holds him tighter
kable pushes her hair back he searches her eyes desperate with emotion
kable contd baby
what did they do
i couldnt stop them
angie shakes her head wont meet his eyes
kable turns to face her
trace contd your daughter was taken into foster care by the state two years ago
kable tries to understand
trace contd the foster parent paid good money to remain anonymous
to make sure the girl would be untraceable
but theres always a data trail if you know where to look
shrugs we do
kable is gathering himself focusing
a fury building
where is she
im sorry tillman
guess he needed an insurance policy
long beat shes with castle
kable slams through crowds hes on a mission
the alley leading to the underground headquarters is right around the corner
gina fights to catch up to him
she gets a hand on his shoulder
gina parker smith contd out of breath wait
i want to come with you
kables eyes leave no room for doubt not a chance
thats all the story youre going to get
he bails leaving her there
just then matching black suvs pull up to the curb just ten feet from where she stands
castles geek squad piles out
gina sees them recognizes them from the interview with castle she turns away just in time to avoid being recognized by a geek as he scans the crowd
but theyre not after her
they head straight for the black
a door opens a switch is thrown
and simon is blinded by harsh fluorescent light
he sits up on a cot wearing a white t shirt and pajama pants fucked up hair groggy
get up and get out
sarcastic yeah aint it
looks like someone up the chain decided youre no longer a threat
simon slides open the door to his room peaks inside hesitantly
the floor is littered with busted up electronics and garbage
the wall sized screens are all running the same thing a single word repeated in columns by the thousands scrolling fast a digital waterfall of words white on black its
simon sits down in the middle of the detritus in a state of mild shock hes lost everything
he gestures at the screen and closes out the scrolling loop
then once again attempting to activate slayers control the screen shows the same nebulous test pattern we last saw on gorges screen
simon slumps against the wall defeated
castles estate is like a deserted city
balconies underlit domes lush landscaping abstract statues waterfalls
tiny cameras everywhere
and not a soul in sight
kable drops over a wall and onto grass
wind in the leaves cricket music otherwise dead silence
he keeps to the trees making his way toward the central then the sound of dogs
they come in a pack loping across the lawn grey more like wolves
kable readies his gun to take them out but the dogs run right past him
they round a corner and disappear
kable looks up spots a camera
and another and another
stands to reason hes been marked already
he walks out into the open
the giant front doors of the mansion are open
kable walks right in
the interior is huge
no furniture no art no people of course
could anyone possibly live here
and then at the far end of a large empty hall a little girl is sitting on the floor by herself playing with dolls making them walk and talk
kables eyes go wide
he starts to walk toward her slowly at first
and finally breaking into a run until he slams into what seems to be an invisible wall crumpling to the ground
the girl doesnt react
kable pounds on the glass
kable contd then looks closer running his fingers across the smooth not bad for video eh
the voice comes from unseen speakers it seems to be everywhere at once intimate
ken castle o
contd the latest and greatest
defy you to tell it from real life
you imagine porn on this thing
kable wants to explode but he contains himself
hes playing castles game and the rules are still undefined
then music the sound of a swingin hi hat from down a long corridor t t tssss t t tssss t t tsss
kable walks toward the source a bass and piano pick up the groove
he comes to a ballroom empty like everything else shiny hardwood floor for dancing
a spotlight pops on from above illuminating ken castle
hes wearing a t shirt and jeans
every instinct tells kable to go after him but he holds back
who knows if its even real
and then castle starts to sing
or more precisely lip sync the voice is sinatra ive got you under my skin
castle is doing a spot on karaoke ive got you under my skin
ive got you deep in the heart of me so deep in my heart that youre really a part of me ive got you under my skin
hes snapping his fingers putting on the moves
then from behind curtains a half dozen slayers appear
we recognize the scarred battle tough faces from the prison the game the pursuit
only instead of blue they are wearing tuxedoes with blue bow ties
kable grips his weapon but the men are unarmed instead they fall in on the beat and go into a choreographed dance behind castle
id sacrifice anything come what might for the sake of having you near in spite of a warning voice that comes in the night and repeats and repeats in my
kable notices shadowy figures around the perimeter of the room
glasses beards pony tails silently the geek squad has moved in and taken position
they move their hands in rhythm synchronized
each one seems to control a dancer they twirl a finger and the slayer spins
kick with two fingers for legs and the slayer kicks like a suddenly on a musical hit everyone castle the geeks the slayers points dramatically up at the wall where
a video screen begins to play it is footage of the geek squad busting into humanz headquarters and efficiently killing everyone
angie is tasered unconscious and dragged away
dont you know little fool you never can win
use your mentality wake up to reality
but each time i do just the thought of you makes me stop before i give in cause ive got you under my skin
kable hits his breaking point
he brings up his weapon to open up on the slayers
the geeks have taken care of that
kable tosses it aside and sprints for castle but the slayers break off from the choreography to engage him turns out theyre flesh and blood after all
castle backs away whistling the melody and continues his softshoe to the music as kable wades into brutal hand to hand combat
breaking necks snapping arms smashing faces
its a full on ballet of death
finally the music ends right on cue kable is finishing off the last of the men blood on his hands
castle applauds the geeks follow suit
genuinely stoked youre awesome
they speak simultaneously i dont care about you
you dont care about me
ken castle contd you just want your little sugar pie i know
so dont do anything stupido
my house my rules
castle walks away leaving his back open to kable seemingly without concern toward a side door
ken castle contd come on i want to show you something
tracking along the hallway medium close profile castle walks along confidently kable following
the background is a black glittering starscape
ive got to thank you for leading me to them by the by the human zuzz that is
snap out wide the hallway seems to run along the surface of the moon another d projection no doubt
craters and lunar debris stretch to the horizon
the geek squad walks along behind castle and kable at a distance
they are all tiny moon ants in the vast lunar panorama
the planet earth rising majestically in the dark heavens
ken castle contd of course soon enough theyd be whistling my tune like everybody else
but meantime it was that little cracker program they dreamed up that got my attention
ken castle contd that was a genuine nuisance no doubt about it
one thing even they didnt know though im wired too
snap back to castle medium close
his eyes are fucking ken castle contd i replaced of my own noodle with nano tissue years ago
they leave the hallway and step on to an indoor nba regulation basketball court electronic scoreboard bleachers the whole nine
its dark moody only one bank of overhead floods is turned on
at the far end of the court hackman is in warm ups shooting baskets
one leg the one with the abbreviated toes is in a flex brace
the geek squad grabs seats in the bleachers
but mines different
taps his forehead built to send to transmit
whereas every other k soft cell out there including the ones in
taps kables forehead your head kable is designed to receive
i think it you do it
castle looks across the court at hackman nods toward him
hackman drops the ball and begins to pop lock
ken castle contd were talking every slayer everyone in society city
i believe your better half would fall under that category
provided theyre within range of my transmitters
castle chuckles at hackman hackman stops dancing jogs over picks up the ball and resumes shooting
sarcastic very nice castle
so youve got an army of psychotics and deviants to dance around for you
castle narrows his eyes amusement edging out irritation he walks over to a bin of grip powder
youre thinking small kable
but not as small as me
he sinks his hands into the powder brings them out and claps making white dust clouds
kable waves the dust away ken castle contd see nano cells are real small a thousand times smaller than even these dust particulates
kable coughs inhale it and they go to work replicating spreading
like a virus multiplying in exponentials
six months time i could have million people converted ditch diggers porn stars presidents and not one would be the wiser
behind kable hackman lets the ball roll away and silently ken castle contd a hundred million folks that will buy what i want them to buy vote how i want
them to vote do pretty much damn well anything i figure they ought to do
hackman comes running at kable from behind eyes burning at a full charge
running into focus
holding the bowie ken castle contd for instance
kable hears hackman at the last second spins and absorbs the tackle
the men go to the ground grappling ufc style
kable has hackmans knife hand by the wrist stopping it but leaving his face unprotected
hackman brings his free elbow down on kables face connecting and opening a cut under his eye then again this time kable catches the elbow with his own free hand
and wrenches it in sideways dislocating hackmans shoulder with a sickening pop
kable works around hackman gets him in a headlock and squeezes
still gripping the knife hand immobilizing it
hackman is choking beat red
for long brutal seconds the life drains out of him
finally hackmans eyes roll back he goes limp
kable takes the bowie knife from hackmans dead fingers
he struggles to his feet dripping sweat and blood
you shouldve let him fight for himself castle he mightve had a shot
pleasant i think youre missing the point my man
no i get it youre pulling the strings on all of this
starts to move toward castle with bad intent which makes my next move pretty easy to figure
kable comes at castle fast bringing the knife around to open his throat like a pez dispenser
his arm freezes in mid air the blade inches from contact
neglected to mention my smart boys reversed that hack those fellas worked for you easy breezy once we had access to their drives
this is gut wrenching for kable after tasting freedom he feels his will ripped away from him
hes being puppeted by ken castle contd youre mine boy
with a twitch of castles eyes kable brings the knife down and slices open his own leg
simon is sitting on the floor head hung low in front of the dead wall
a glitch a flicker
the screen comes to life
its kables pov of ken castle
castle is stripping off his shirt
on screen come on lets boogie woogie rock and roll
castle throws a funky karate kick and nails kable in the jaw
then a haymaker to the gut doubling kable over
he lets kable swing the knife just short of his face as he backs away
biggest baddest slayer in the game
dont seem like much does he
castle is enjoying the hell out of himself
he uppercuts kable snapping his head back
then shakes out his knuckles
ken castle contd oww
kable swings his open hand around castle choreographs it perfectly kables nails rake across castles stomach marking him up like bruce lee in enter the dragon
castle strikes a pose to match
ken castle contd lucky shot
grins ok not really
he brings a passable reverse crescent kick that drops kable to the floor
ken castle contd i need an audience boys
a door opens at the far end of the court kable looks up slowly afraid of what he knows hell see angie and delia are led into the room
angie presses herself close to delia holding her shoulders protectively
she keeps her distance from the geek squad escorts and tries to block delia from them there is raw fear and anger in her eyes the geek squad are not
overtly violent or menacing but angie seems acutely aware that they are lethal
delia seems oddly neutral and unaffected by the entire situation
castle kicks kable across the floor toward them
ken castle contd thats right you crawl on your belly like a toad
he looks to the geek squad sheepish is this bad
im really bad
he gives kable a last kick kable collapses in front of his daughter
she looks down at him curiously
he looks up at delia eyes soaked with emotion
then to angie
they share a moment of intense eye contact we feel that angie wants desperately to go to him but is unsure of what is the best action to take strategically
she is looking to kable for a clue
kables eyes go back to delia he tries to reach up and gently touch her face
ken castle contd thats sweet
castle steps on kables hand pinning it to the floor
ken castle contd alright boys you ready
a true test
he steels his eyes on kable and concentrates
kable slowly brings up the knife toward delias throat
angie moves to pull delia away castle merely glances up at her and she freezes paralyzed
we can see her body strain against invisible control raw panic in her eyes
just like last time
kable is fighting it with all his will his whole body shaking
ken castle contd youre stronger now
a little more fight in you
but i think the end result will be about the same
ken castle contd shh
the geeks look on impassive
the blade is inches away
he looks into angies eyes she and kable are like one he seems to draw strength from her
finally kable wills everything he has and stabs the knife into the floorboards
suddenly kables head snaps around his eyes confused
and in one quick smooth movement kable yanks the knife out of the floor rises to his feet and spins on castle
he claps a hand around castles neck and tries to jam the knife up into his gut but castle is able to freeze him just short
ken castle contd freaked what the hell was that
the geeks break out tiny devices and start quickly scanning
not even kable understands this
there are networks accessing the same ip address
someone on the outside is sending him commands
simon is on his feet in full badass gamer mode
his body is positioned exactly like kables right hand gripping the virtual blade for an underhand thrust left hand clutching castles throat
he forces his right hand
kables knife hand begins to inch forward
now castle is the one struggling for control he claws weakly at kables hand trying to loosen it off his neck
panicking irritated working on it
kables eyes are locked in on castles
straining with everything he has
his strength and will overpowering castle but like hes explaining the obvious to a child i think it
kable succumbing to castles control begins to move the knife away from castles belly
ken castle contd you
castle delivers a crunching headbutt to his nose kable loses his footing sweat pouring down his face bloody drained
castle pushes the knife back towards kable
he fights back every muscle in his arm fighting against another like yin yang veins rising in his neck
then kable senses an opportunity look at this knife
imagine me sticking it into your gut
think about it
make it real
but his eyes flicker to the knife of course he cant help but picture it
and in that instant kable jams in the blade
castle focuses trying to pull it back out but kable shoves it in deeper castles eyes bulge
finally kable twists the knife and lifts castle off the ground
the paralysis breaks from angie she lunges forward to throw her arms around her daughter
triumphant he drops down into the badass rockstar pose
and kable does the same
damn it kid
castle collapses to his knees in front of kable glass eyed draining life
they are face to face
kable contd is the fuckin pose really necessary
castle face plants on the court
kables body relaxes he tosses the knife across the floor
then turns to face his family
when delia finally speaks there is a trace of castles georgia peach accent
are you my daddy tillman
he gathers delia in his arms and lifts her off her feet squeezing her close she squeezes back
kable grabs angie with his other arm and pulls her in
the geeks look at one another realize that their employment contract with castle has just been terminated
shrug pocket their shit zip up their backpacks and fanny packs get up and start to file out
geek leader stops
kable contd shut it off
set us free
the geeks look at one another
kable contd its nothing to you
a mouse click
geek leader shrugs
he nods to ponytail geek do it
the geek leader betrays a ghost of a smile
geek leader contd well played kable
kable doesnt answer but his eyes say how was any of this a fucking game
why did daddy tillman hurt daddy ken
its trace filming herself
this is for you you dumb bitch
i hope you do the right thing with it
the image switches to the captured footage of kable in the military facility
leading up to scotchs murder
the light from the screen reflects on gina parker smiths face shes wide eyed stunned
shooting stars fly past us in the dark
the same image we started with
only instead of an underground train carrying soldiers to battle
the tunnel ends we break from the side of a mountain into kable is driving on the open highway
angie is in the passenger seat asleep head pressed up against the window glass
kable checks the rear view window makes eye contact with delia who is suspended in a lightweight car seat in the back seat
you good sweetheart
kable allows himself a smile puts his eyes back on the road
angie slowly reaches for kables hand she rubs her thumb on his tattoo i am right here with you and falls back asleep
the camera tilts up stares out the front window and moves into the giant sun
