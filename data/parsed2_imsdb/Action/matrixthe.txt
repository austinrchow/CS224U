written by larry and andy wachowski april so close it has no boundaries
a blinking cursor pulses in the electric darkness like a heart coursing with phosphorous light burning beneath the derma of black neon glass
a phone begins to ring we hear it as though we were making the call
the cursor continues to throb relentlessly patient until hello
data now slashes across the screen information flashing faster than we read
call trans opt received
rec log im inside
anything to report
we listen to the phone conversation as though we were on a third line
the mans name is cypher
the woman lets see
target left work at trace program running
the entire screen fills with racing columns of numbers
shimmering like green electric rivets they rush at a digit phone number in the top corner
he caught the northbound howard line
got off at sheridan
purchased six pack of beer and a box of captain crunch
the area code is identified
the first three numbers suddenly fixed leaving only seven flowing columns
we begin moving toward the screen closing in as each digit is matched one by one snapping into place like the wheels of a slot machine
all right youre relieved
use the usual exit
do you know when were going to make contact
only two thin digits left
just between you and me you dont believe it do you
you dont believe this guy is the one
i think morpheus believes he is
but what about you
i think morpheus knows things that i dont
yeah but if hes wrong the final number pops into place did you hear that
call origin are you sure this line is clean
yeah course im sure
we move still closer the electric hum of the green numbers growing into an ominous roar
i better go
see you on the other side
she hangs up as we pass through the numbers entering the netherworld of the computer screen
where gradually the sound of a police radio grows around us
attention all units
attention all units
suddenly a flashlight cuts open the darkness and we find ourselves in the hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way across the polyester carpeting destroying several rooms as
it spooled soot up the walls and ceiling leaving patterns of permanent shadow
we follow four armed police officers using flashlights as they creep down the blackened hall and ready themselves on either side of room
the biggest of them violently kicks in the door the other cops pour in behind him guns thrust before them
the room is almost devoid of furniture
there is a fold up table and chair with a phone a modern and a powerbook computer
the only light in the room is the glow of the computer
sitting there her hands still on the keyboard is trinity a woman in black leather
get your hands behind your head
hands behind your head
she slowly puts her hands behind her head
a black sedan with tinted windows glides in through the police cruisers
agent smith and agent brown get out of the car
they wear dark suits and sunglasses even at night
they are also always hardwired small secret service earphones in one ear its cord coiling back into their shirt collars
lieutenant you were given specific orders im just doing my job
you gimme that juris my dick tion and you can cran it up your ass
the orders were for your protection
the lieutenant laughs
i think we can handle one little girl
agent smith nods to agent brown as they start toward the hotel
i sent two units
theyre bringing her down now
no lieutenant your men are dead
the big cop flicks out his cuffs the other cops holding a bead
theyve done this a hundred times they know theyve got her until the big cop reaches with the cuff and trinity moves it almost doesnt register so smooth and fast
the eye blinks and trinitys palm
snaps up and the nose explodes blood erupting
the cop is dead before he begins to fall
and trinity is moving again seizing a wrist misdirecting a gun as a startled cop a head explodes
in blind panic another airs his gun the barrel a fixed black hole and fires trinity twists out of the way the bullet missing as she reverses into a roundhouse
kick knocking the gun away
the cop begins to scream when a jump kick crushes his windpipe killing the scream as he falls to the ground
she looks at the four bodies
agent brown enters the hotel while agent smith heads for the alley
trinity is on the phone pacing
the other end is answered
the link was traced
i dont know how
are there any agents
you have to focus
there is a phone
wells and laxe
you can make it
she takes a deep breath centering herself
all right go
she drops the phone
she bursts out of the room as agent brown enters the hall leading another unit of police
trinity races to the opposite end exiting through a broken window onto the fire escape
in the alley below trinity sees agent smith staring at her
she can only go up
on the roof trinity is running as agent brown rises over the parapet leading the cops in pursuit
trinity begins to jump from one roof to the next her moverents so clean gliding in and out of each jump contrasted to the wild jumps of the cops
agent brown however has the same unnatural grace
the metal scream of an el train is heard and trinity turns to it racing for the back of the building
the edge falls away into a wide back alley
the next building is over feet away but trinitys face is perfectly calm staring at some point beyond the other roof
the cops slow realizing they are about to see something ugly as trinity drives at the edge launching herself into the air
from above the ground seems to flow beneath her as she hangs in flight then hitting somersaulting up still running hard
motherfucker thats impossible
they stare slack jawed as agent brown duplicates the move exactly landing rolling over a shoulder up onto one knee
just below the building are the runbling tracks of riveted steel
the train screeches beneath her a rattling blur of gray metal
trinity junps landing easily
she looks back just as agent brown hurls through the air barely reaching the last car agent brown stands yanking out a gun
trinity is running hard as bullets whistle past her head
ahead she sees her only chance feet beyond the point where the train has begun to turn there is a window a yellow glow in the midst of a dark
trinity zeroes in on it running as hard as she can her speed compounded by the train
the scream of the steel rises as she nears the edge where the train rocks into the turn
trinity hurtles into the empty night space her body leveling into a dive
she falls arms covering her head as the whole world seems to spin on its axis and she crashes with an explosion of glass and wood then falls onto a
back stairwell tumbling bouncing down stairs bleeding broken but still alive
through the smashed window she glimpses agent brown still on the train his tie and coat whipping in the wind stone faced he touches his ear piece as the train
slides him past the window
trinity tries to move
get up trinity
get up just get up
she stands and limps down the rest of the stairs
trinity emerges from the shadows of an alley and at the end of the block in a pool of white street light she sees it
the telephone booth
obviously hurt she starts down the concrete walk focusing in completely her pace quickening as the phone begins to ring
across the street a garbage truck suddenly u turns its tires screaming as it accelerates
trinity sees the headlights on the truck arcing at the telephone booth as if taking aim
gritting through the pain she races the truck slamming into the booth the headlights blindingly bright bearing down on the box of plexiglas just as she answers the phone
there is a frozen instant of silence before the hulking mass of dark metal lurches up onto the sidewalk barreling through the booth bulldozing it into a brick wall smashing
it to plexiglas pulp
after a moment a black loafer steps down from the cab of the garbage truck
agent smith inspects the wreckage
there is no body
trinity is gone
his jaw sets as he grinds his molars in frustration
agent jones walks up behind him
did you get anything from the room
their next target
the name is neo
the handset of the pay phone lays on the ground separated in the crash like a severed limb
well need a search running
its already begun
we are sucked towards the mouthpiece of the phone closer and closer until the smooth gray plastic spreads out like a horizon and the small holes widen until we fall
through one swallowed by the darkness that becomes a computer screen
we are on line inside a chat room called the matrix
it is an exklusive web site where hackers hang out
jackon i heard morpheus has been on this board
superastic morpheus doesnt even exist and the matrix is nothing but an advertising gimmick a new game
timaxe all i want to know is trinity really a girl
lodiii of all women on line are really men
quark the matrix is a euphemism for the government
superastic no the matrix is the system controlling our lives
timaxe you mean mtv
superastic i mean sega
we drift back from the electric conversation entering it is a studio apartirent that seems overgrown with technology
weed like cables coil everywhere duct taped into thickets that wind up and around the legs of several desks
tabletops are filled with cannibalized equipment that lay open like an autopsied corpse
we turn towards the center of this rat nest of technology following the slurping and crunching of cereal
we pass an open box of capln crunch as we find neo a younger man who knows more about living inside a computer than living outside one
fuckin idiots dont know shit
he finishes his cereal and is about to disconnect when an anonynous message slices onto the screen
do you want to know what the matrix is neo
neo is frozen when he reads his name
superastic who said that
jackon whos neo
gibson this is a private board
if you want to know follow the white rabbit
what the hell
timaxe someone is hacking the hackers
fos its morpheus
jackon identify yourself
knock knock neo
a chill runs down his spine and when someone knocks on his door he almost jumps out of his chair
he looks at the door then back at the computer but the message is gone
he shakes his head not completely sure what happened
again someone knocks
cautiously neo approaches the door
hey tommy boy
you in there
recognizing the voice he relaxes and opens it
anthony who lives down the hall is standing outside with a group of friends
what do you want anthony
i need your help man
they got me man
the shackles of fascism
he holds up the red notice that accompanies the denver boot
you got the money this time
he holds up two hundred dollars and neo opens the door
anthonys girlfriend dujour stops in front of neo
you can really get that thing off right now
i told you honey he may look like just another geek but this here is all we got left standing between big brother and the new world order
a police officer unlocks a yellow metal boot from the wheel of an enormous oldsmobile
they watch from the window as the cops silently robotically climb into their van
look at em
dont think about what theyre doing or why
computer tells em what to do and they do it
friend l thc banality of evil
he slaps the money in neos hand
why dont you come to the party with us
i dont know
i have to work tomorrow
itll be fun
he looks up at her and suddenly notices on her black leather motorcycle jacket dozens of pins bands symbols slogans military medals and a small white rabbit
the room tilts
sure ill go
an older chicago apartment a series of halls connects a chain of small high ceilinged rooms lined with heavy casements
smoke hangs like a veil blurring the few lights there are
dressed predominantly in black people are everywhere gathered in cliques around pieces of furniture like jungle cats around a tree
neo stands against a wall alone sipping from a bottle of beer feeling completely out of place he is about to leave when he notices a woman staring at him
the woman is trinity
she walks straight up to him
in the nearest room shadow like figures grind against each other to the pneumatic beat of industrial music
how did you know that i know a lot about you
ive been wanting to meet you for some time
who are you
my name is trinity
the trinity that cracked the i
kansas city d base
that was a long time ago
i just thought
you were a guy
most guys do
neo is a little embarrassed
do you want to go sorewhere and talk
its safe here and i dont have much time
the music is so loud they must stand very close talking directly into each others ear
that was you on the board tonight
that was your note wasnt it
i had to gamble that you would see and they wouldnt
i cant explain everything to you
im sure that its all going to seem very strange but i brought you here to warn you neo
you are in a lot of danger
theyre watching you
something happened and they found out about you
normally if our target is exposed we let it go
but this time we cant do that
i dont understand you came here because you wanted to know the answer to a hackers question
what is the matrix
twelve years ago i met a man a great man who said that no one could be told the answer to that question
that they had to see it to believe it
her body is against his her lips very close to his ear
he told me that no one should look for the answer unless they have to because once you see it everything changes
your life and the world you live in will never be the same
its as if you wake up one morning and the sky is falling
there is a hypnotic quality to her voice and neo feels the words like a drug seeping into him
the truth is out there neo
its looking for you and it will find you if you want it to
she takes hold of him with her eyes
thats all i can tell you right now
good bye neo
and good luck
who was it
who was the man
she leans close her lips alrost touching his ear as she whispers
you know who
she turns and he watches her melt into the shifting wall of bodies
a sound rises steadily growing out of the music pressing in on neo until it is all he can hear as we the sound is an alarm clock slowly dragging
neo to consciousness
he strains to read the clock face shitshitshit
the downtown office of cortechs a software development company
the main offices are along each wall the windows overlooking downtown chicago
rhineheart the ultimate company man lectures neo without looking at him typing at his computer continuously
neo stares at two window cleaners on a scaffolding outside dragging their rubber squeegees down across the surface of the glass
you have a problem mr
you think that youre special
you believe that somehow the rules do not apply to you
he stops glancing over his glasses at neo who turns in time
obviously you are mistaken
his long bony fingers resume clicking the keyboard
this company is one of the top software companies in the world because every single employee understands that they are a part of a whole
thus if an employee has a problem the company has a problem
he turns again
the time has come to make a choice mr
either you choose to be at your desk on time from this day forth or you choose to find yourself another job
do i make myself clear
the entire floor looks like a human honeycomb with a labyrinth of cubicles structured around a core of elevators
neo slumps down into his chair
a tall employee stands up in the adjacent cubicle leaning over the partition
what did he say
if i was late again im going to be fired
well it was nice working with you
neo glares at him as he sinks down
neo turns and finds a federal express man at his cubicle door
neo signs the electronic pad and the fedex guy hands him the softpak
have a nice day
he opens the bag
inside is a cellular phone
it seems the instant it is in his hand it rings
unnerved he flips it open
this is morpheus
neos knees give and he falls into his chair
i had hoped for this conversation to take place under less adverse conditions but you can never count on hope can you neo
ive been watching you neo and i want to meet you
i dont know if youre ready to see what i want to show you but unfortunately we have run out of time
theyre coming for you neo
and im not sure what theyre going to do
whos coming for me
stand up and see for yourself
neo starts to stand
do it slowly
his head slowly peeks up over the partition
at the elevator he sees agent brown and agent jones leading a group of cops
a female employee turns and points out neos cubicle
holy fuckin shit
one cop stays at the elevator the others follow the agents
what the fuck do they want with me
im not sure
but if you dont want to find out you better get out of there
i can guide you out but you have to do exactly what i say
the agents are moving quickly towards the cubicle
the cubicle across from you is empty
but what if
neo lunges across the hall diving into the other cubicle just as the agents turn into his row
neo crams himself into a dark corner clutching the phone tightly to him
stay here for a moment
the agents enter neos empty cubicle
a cop is sent to search the bathroom
morpheus voice is a whisper in neos ear
a little longer
brown is talking to the tall employee
when i tell you go to the end of the row to the first office on the left stay
as low as you can
sweat trickles down his forehead
neo rolls out of the cubicle his eyes popping as he freezes right behind a cop who has just turned around
staying crouched he sneaks away down the row shooting across the opening to the first office on the left
the room is empty
now there is a window
how do you know all this
morpheus laughs quietly
the answer is coming neo
he opens the window
the window howls into the room
outside theres a scaffold
you can use it to get to the roof
leaning out the window he sees that the scaffold is several offices away
its too far away
theres a small ledge
its a short climb
you can make it
neo looks down the buildings glass wall vertigos into a concrete chasm
no way no way this is crazy
dont be controlled by your fear neo
there are only two ways out of this building
one is that scaffold
the other is in their custody
you take a chance either way
i leave it to you
he hangs up
neo looks at the door then back at the scaffold
this is insane
why is this happening to me
what did i do
i didnt do anything
he climbs up onto the window ledge
hanging onto the frame he steps onto the small ledge
the scaffold seems even farther away
im going to die
the wind suddenly blasts up the face of the building knocking neo off balance
recoiling he clings harder to the frame and the phone falls out of his hand
he watches as it is swallowed by the distance beneath him
this is insane
i cant do this
he climbs back into the office just as a cop opens the door
i didnt do anything
the agents lead a handcuffed neo out of the revolving doors forcing his head down as they push him into the dark sedan
trinity watches in the rear view mirror of her motorcycle
a wide angle view of a white roon where neo is sitting at a table alone
we move into the monitor entering the room as if the monitor were a window
at the same moment the door opens and the agents enter
smith sits down across from neo
a thick manila envelope slaps down on the table between them
neo glances at the name on the file anderson thomas as you can see weve had our eye on you for some time now mr
he opens the file
paper rattle marks the silence as he flips several pages
neo cannot tell if he is looking at the file or at him
it seems that you have been living two lives
in one life you are thomas a
anderson program writer for a respectable software company
you have a social security number you pay your taxes and you help your land lady carry out her garbage
the pages continue to turn
the other life is lived in computers where you go by the hacker alias neo and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for including the
unauthorized use of the d
system for the removal of automobile boots
neo feels himself sinking into a pit of shit
one of these lives has a future
one of them does not
he closes the file
im going to be as forthcoming as i can be mr
you are here because we need your help
he removes his sunglasses his eyes are an unnatural ice blue
we know that you have been contacted by a certain individual
a man who calls himself morpheus
whatever you think you know about this man is irrelevant to the fact that he is wanted for acts of terrorism in more countries than any other man in the
he is considered by many authorities to be the most dangerous man alive
he leans closer
my colleagues believe that i am wasting my time with you but i believe you want to do the right thing
it is obvious that you are an intelligent man mr
anderson and that you are interested in the future
that is why i believe you are ready to put your past mistakes behind you and get on with your life
neo tries to match his stare
we are willing to wipe the slate clean to give you a fresh start and all we are asking in return is your cooperation in bringing a known terrorist to
neo nods to himself
that sounds like a real good deal
but i think i have a better one
how about i give you the finger he does
and you can cram that file up your secret service sphincter
agent smith puts his glasses back on
you disappoint me mr
you aint seen nothing yet
the irony of your situation is that you have no choice
you cant scare me with this gestapo crap
i know my rights
i want my phone call
agent smith smiles
and tell me mr
anderson what good is a phone call iy you are unable to speak
the question unnerves neo and strangely he begins to feel the muscles in his jaw tighten
the standing agents snicker watching neos confusion grow into panic
neo feels his lips grow soft and sticky as they slowly seal shut melding into each other until all trace of his mouth is gone
wild with fear he lunges for the door but the agents restrain him holding him in the chair
you are going to help us mr
anderson whether you want to or not
smith nods and the other two rip open his shirt
from a case taken out of his suit coat smith removes a long fiber optic wire tap
neo struggles helplessly as smith dangles the wire over his exposed abdomen
horrified he watches as the electronic device animates become an organic creature that resembles a hybrid of an insect and a fluke worm
thin whisker like tendrils reach out and probe into neos navel
he bucks wildly as smith drops the creature which looks for a moment like an uncut umbilical cord before it begins to burrow its tail thrashing as it worms its
screaming neo bolts upright in bed
he realizes that he is home
was it a dream
his mouth is normal
his stomach looks fine
he starts to take a deep everything is okay breath when the phone rings
it almost stops his heart
it continues ringing building pressure in the room forcing him up out of bed sucking him in with an almost gravitational force
he answers it saying nothing
this line is tapped so i must be brief
the agents they got to you first but theyve underestimated how important you are
if they knew what i know you would probably be dead
neo feels sick
i dont know what you are thinking right now but i want you to understand that i will not give up on you until you give up on me
neos throat cracks dry as the sahara
do you still want to meet
take the howard line south
he closes his eyes unsure of what he has done
an el train rages against its metal rails
it is three a
and the train carries the usual urban night crawlers
neo sits alone eyes shifting watching everything nervously
there is a metal bang and train clatter fills the car as the door is opened
neo turns and sees a large man enter
he is wearing sunglasses and a black leather jacket
his name is apoc and he walks straight at neo
come with me
neo stands just as the door at the opposite end opens and two police officers rush in drawing their guns
apoc grabs neo muscling him to the nearest exit
there is no upcoming station
apoc yanks the emergency brake and the train buckles against its own speed
the cops are thrown back
neo slams against the metal rail
the doors open onto nothing and just when neo regains his balance apoc shoves him backwards he flies out from the train arms windrilling as he falls from the raised
tracks hurtling towards a busy city street when out of nowhere a truck races under him and he crashes into a large dumpster bed filled with empty boxes
still shaking his head neo realizes he is not alone
a man named cabie is aiming a big gun at him
trinity is next to him talking into a cellular phone
we got him
call the chop shop
she hangs up
listen to me neo
you have to trust us
she tears off a long strip of black duct tape and reaches for his face
what are you doing
this has to be done for your protection and ours
she seals his eyes shut with the tape
you cant understand right now but if youre not one of us youre one of them
a featureless black van glides up to a staircase that curls down from the citys surface
trinity guides the blind neo down the steps
the back of the van slaps open revealing a young skinny man who looks to be still in his teens wearing an outfit that is a cross between a surgeon
and a telephone repair man
his name is gizmo and he smiles lewdly at trinity exposing his teeth that are wired with weird looking braces
va va va voom
still the hottest software around
neo hears the voices around him
this is really the guy
the guy that morpheus thinks yeah
but hes so old
are you going to help us or arent you
load up the copper top and lets get the hell outta here
hacksaw is a huge man in a leather welders apron
he shoulders neo and hauls him into the van
a moment later the green lights of lower wacker curve over the tinted windshield as the van rushes through the underworld
the chop shop is filled with electronic gadgets wired to meters and monitors
there are shelves lined with medical supplies and rows of hanging tools knives cleavers and stainless steel clamps
neo is strapped down to an ambulance cart listening nervously as gizmo gets to work
okay first we take a little look under the hood
he pulls up the goggles hanging at his neck and they blink to life with tiny halogen lights and lenses irising to varying levels of magnification
youre going to feel a little prick
he inserts acupuncture like needles into neos lower abdomen
the needles are wired to video monitors
hacksaw pilots the fiber optic lens
what are you doing
we think youre bugged
we cant take you to morpheus until youre clean
there it is
on a monitor we see the bug nestled in among neols large intestines
hit him with ccs of local
hacksaw loads a hypodermic needle and pumps an anesthetic around neols navel
using a device that looks like a miniature speculum gizmo inserts a knuckled dental pick
typing into a calculator keypad wired to the pick he automates the tip
on the monitor we watch it telescope out and the end separate into a tiny hooked metal claw
here kitty kitty kitty
the claw snags hold of the bug
but the bug reacts violently
neo screams as it wraps itself around the soft tissue web of intestine
i dont know
theyve never done that before
neo writhes in pain
hold him down
i got it
maybe we can stun it
are you crazy
that will kill him
we watch neo who cant see what they are talking about
come on do it or hacksaw will
the instant he hears the word he knows
oh shit the cry is frozen in his mouth as the paddles hit his chest
gizmo wrestles with the bug
hit him again
again the electricity convulses through him as gizmo yanks the speculum out
trinity touches neo who is just beginning to breathe
she eases the tape off his eyes
neo are you okay
we got it
hanging from the claw pick is the inanimate metal wire tap
nasty little bugger aint it
the van stops in a deserted alley behind a forgotten hotel
the doors open and trinity helps neo get out
thanks for your help gizmo
i just hope the man knows what hes doing
she nods then climbs out of the van
gizmo ogles the tight leather pants
goddamn what i wouldnt give for a copy of that software
trinity turns around
gizmo you dont have the hardware to handle this software
he howls with adolescent laughter as the van pulls away
trinity turns to neo
it is a place of putrefying elegance a rotting host of urban maggotry
trinity leads neo from the stairwell down the hall of the thirteenth floor
they stop outside room
this is it
neo can hear his own heart pounding
let me give one piece of advice
he knows more than you can possibly imagine
across the room a dark figure stares out the tall windows veiled with decaying lace
he turns and his smile lights up the room
he wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible behind circular mirrored glasses
he strides to neo and they shake hands
as you no doubt have guessed i am morpheus
its an honor
he nods to trinity
thank you trinity
she bows her head sharply and exits through a door to an adjacent room
they sit across from one another in cracked burgundy leather chairs
i imagine right now you must be feeling a bit like alice tumbling down the rabbit hole
you could say that
i can see it in your eyes
you have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up
a smile razor thin curls the corner of his lips
ironically this is not far from the truth
but im getting ahead of myself
can you tell me neo why are you here
youre morpheus youre a legend
most hackers would die to meet you
but i think we both know theres more to it than that
do you believe in fate neo
because i dont like the idea that im not in control of my life
i know exactly what you mean
again that smile that could cut glass
let me tell you why you are here
you are here because you have the gift
ive watched you neo
you do not use a computer like a tool
you use it like it was part of yourself
what you can do inside a computer is not normal
ive seen it
what you do is magic
its not magic
but it is neo
how else would you describe what has been happening to you
he leans forward
we are trained in this world to accept only what is rational and logical
have you ever wondered why
neo shakes his head
as children we do not separate the possible from the impossible which is why the younger a mind is the easier it is to free while a mind like yours
can be very difficult
free from what
from the matrix
neo locks at his eyes but only sees a reflection of himself
do you want to know what it is neo
neo swallows and nods his head
its that feeling you have had all your life
that feeling that something was wrong with the world
you dont know what it is but its there like a splinter in your mind driving you mad driving you to me
but what is it
the leather creaks as he leans back
the matrix is everywhere its all around us here even in this room
you can see it out your window or on your television
you feel it when you go to work or go to church or pay your taxes
it is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth
that you are a slave neo
that you like everyone else was born into bondage
kept inside a prison that you cannot smell taste or touch
a prison for your mind
outside the wind batters a loose pane of glass
unfortunately no one can be told what the matrix is
you have to see it for yourself
hold out your hands
in neos right hand morpheus drops a red pill
this is your last chance
after this there is no going back
in his left a blue pill
you take the blue pill and the story ends
you wake in your bed and you believe whatever you want to believe
the pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses
you take the red pill and you stay in wonderland and i show you how deep the rabbit hole goes
neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules with the moisture growing in his palms
remember that all i am offering is the truth
neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill
the cheshire smile returns
he leads neo into the other room which is cramped with high tech equipment glowing ash bliie and electric green from the racks of monitors
trinity apoc and cypher look up as they enter
i knew he would
cypher saddles up to morpheus talking in a hushed tone away from neo
morpheus i know what you believe but i think this is a mistake
were rushing him
im afraid he might pop
havent i always told you cypher not to let fear control your life
apoc are we on line
neo recognizes the large man from the el train
he and trinity are working quickly hardwiring a complex system of monitors modules and drives
you wrote the four horsemen virus
neo time is always against us
will you take a seat there
in the center of the room sits a chair
near the chair is an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked
i imagine you know sonething about virtual reality
neo sits and trinity begins gently fixing white electrode disks to his head arns and the back of his neck
tell me about it
essentially its a hardware system that uses an apparatus headgear gloves and whatever to make you feel that you are in a computer program
if the virtual reality apparatus as you called it was wired to all of your senses and controlled them completely would you be able to tell the difference between the
virtual world and the real world
you might not no
no you wouldnt
neo whispers to trinity
you did all this
she nods placing a set of headphones over his ears
they are wired to an old hotel phone
the pill you took is part of a trace program
its going to make things feel a bit strange
distantly through the ear phones he hears apoc pounding on a keyboard
sweat beads his face
his eyes blink and twitch when he notices the mirror
wide eyed he stares as it begins to heal itself a webwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the mirror were becoming liquid
cypher works with apoc checking reams of phosphorescent data
trinity monitors neos electric vital signs
neo reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers disappear beneath the rippling surface
quickly he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror stretches in long rubbery strands like mirrored taffy stuck to his fingertips
what is this
just relax neo
the strands thin like rubber cement as he pulls away until the fragile wisps of mirror thread break
with the tinkling of glass shimmering snowflakes of electric blinking mercury fall hit the ground and fade
he looks at his hand fingers distended into mirrored icicles that begin to melt rapidly dripping running like wax down his fingers spreading across his palms where he sees his
its going into replication
morpheus takes out a cellular phone and dials a number
tank were going to need the signal soon
stay calm neo
the mirror gel seems to come to life racing crawling up his arns like hundreds of insects
the mirror creeps up his neck as neo begins to panic tipping his head as though he were sinking into the mirror trying to keep his mouth up
its all over me morpheus is right next to him with the phone
i got a fibrillation
i knew it i knew it
streams of mercury run from neos nose
an alarm on trinitys monitor erupts
hes going into arrest
hes gonna pop
i got him
now tank now
his eyes tear with mirror rolling up and closing as a high pitched electric scream erupts in the headphones it is a piercing shriek like a computer calling to another
computer neos body arches in agony and we are pulled like we were pulled into the holes of the phone sucked into his scream and swallowed by darkness
floating in a womb red amnion
his body spasms fighting against the thick gelatin
metal tubes surreal versions of hospital tubes obscure his face
other lines like ivs are connected to limbs and cover his genitals
he is struggling desperately now
air bubbles into the jell o but does not break the surface
pressing up the surface distends stretching like a red rubber coccon
unable to breathe he fights wildly to stand clawing at the thinning elastic shroud until it ruptures a hole widening around his mouth as he sucks for air
tearing himself free he emerges from the cell
it is neo
he is bald and naked his body slick with gelatin
dizzy nauseous he waits for his vision to focus
he is standing in an oval capsule of clear alloy filled with red gelatin the surface of which has solidified like curdled milk
the ivs in his arms are plugged into outlets that appear to be grafted to his flesh
he feels the weight of another cable and reaches to the back of his head where he finds an enormous coaxial plugged and locked into the base of his skull
he tries to pull it out but it would be easier to pull off a finger
to either side he sees other tube shaped pods filled with red gelatin beneath the wax like surface pale and motionless he sees other human beings
fanning out in a circle there are more
all connected to a center core each capsule like a red dimly glowing petal attached to a black metal stem
above him level after level the stem rises seemingly forever
he moves to the foot of the capsule and looks out
the image assaults his mind
towers of glowing petals spiral up to incomprehensible heights disappearing down into a dim murk like an underwater abyss
his sight is blurred and warped exaggerating the intensity of the vision
the sound of the plant is like the sound of the ocean heard from inside the belly of leviathan
below neo a petal detaches from the stem bearing away the body of an old man like an automated barge even as a new pod rises up and plugs itself
into the empty space
inside the new capsule its surface more translucent and pinkish in color neo sees a small baby
from above a machine drops directly in front of neo
he swallows his scream as it seems to stare at him
it is almost insect like in its design beautiful housings of alloyed metal covering organic like systems of hard and soft polymers
a black particle beam washes over neo he reacts in pain as the scanner seems to expose the nervous system wired to the coaxial cable at his cerebral cortex
at the back of the neck the cable lock spins and opens disengaging
the cable pulls itself free a long clear plastic needle and cerebrum chip slides from the anterior of neols skull with an ooze of blood and spinal fluid
the other connective hoses snap free and snake away as the back of the unit opens and a tremendous vacuum like an airplane door opening sucks the gelatin and then
neo into a black hole
the pipe is a waste disposal system and neo falls sliding with the clot of gelatin
banking through pipe spirals and elbows flushing up through grease traps clogged with cily clunps of cellulite
neo begins to drown when he is suddenly snatched from the flow of waste
the metallic cable then lifts pulling him up into the belly of the futuristic flying nachine hovering inside the sewer main line
the metal harness opens and drops the half conscious neo onto the floor
human hands and arms help him up as he finds himself looking straight at morpheus
trinity and apoc
and others dressed in bizarre high tech combat gear
welcome to the real world neo
neo passes out
we have no sense of time
we hear voices whispering
do you think morpheus is right
do you think he could be the one
it doesnt matter now
but if hes wrong
neos eyes flutter open
we see trinitys face above us angelic in the fluorescent glow of a light stick
am i dead
far from it
he opens his eyes again something tingling through him
he focuses and sees his body pierced with dozens of acupuncture like needles wired to a strange device
he needs a lot of work
dozer and morpheus are operating on neo
what are you doing
your muscles have atrophied
were rebuilding them
fluorescent light sticks burn unnaturally bright
why do my eyes hurt
youve never used them before
morpheus takes his sunglasses off and puts them on neo
neo lays back
the answers are coming
neo wakes up from a deep sleep feeling better
he is wearing a black tank top and shorts
he begins to examine himself
there is a futuristic iv plugged into the jack in his forearm
he pulls it out staring at the grafted outlet
he feels his bald head
his fingers find and explore the large outlet in the base of his skull
just as he starts to come unglued morpheus opens the door
morpheus whats happened to me
what is this place
more important than what is when
you believe the year is when in fact it is much closer to
i cant say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know
the wind is knocked from neos chest
thats not possible
i promised you the truth neo and the truth is that the world you were living in was a lie
ill show you
like a sleepwalker neo follows morpheus through the ship
this is my ship the nebuchadnezzar
its a hovercraft
small like a submarine
its cramped and cold
but its home
they climb a ladder up to the main deck
everyone is there
this is the main deck
you know most of my crew
trinity smiles and nods
the ones you dont know
thats mouse and switch
the two big guys are tank and dozer
the names and faces wash meaninglessly over neo
and this this is the core
this is where we broadcast our pirate signal and hack into the matrix
it is a swamp of bizarre electronic equipment
vines of coaxial hang and snake to and from huge monolithic battery slabs a black portable satellite dish and banks of little systems and computer monitors
at the center of the web there are six ectoskeleton chairs made of a poly alloy frame and suspension harness
near the circle of chairs is the control console and operators station where the network is monitored
help him trinity
neo allows himself to be helped into one of the chairs
do you remember when i asked you about an apparatus that could turn a virtual reality into reality
its right here
he touches neos head
and its accessed here
neo feels morpheus guiding a coaxial line into the jack at the back of his neck
the cable has the same kind of cerebellum chip we saw inside the plant
this will feel a little weird
there are several disturbing noises as he works the needle in
we move in as neos shoulders bunch and his face tightens into a grimace until a loud click fires and his ears pop like when you equalize them underwater
he relaxes opening his eyes as we pull back to a feeling of weightlessness inside another place neo is standing in an empty blank white space
this is the construct
startled neo whips around and finds morpheus now in the room with him
it is our loading program
we can load anything from clothes to weapons to training simulations
anything we need
morpheus walks past neo and when neo turns he sees the two leather chairs from the hotel set up in front of a large screen television
neo stands at the back of the chair as morpheus sits
right now were inside a computer program
wild isnt it
neos hands run over the cracked leather
this isnt real
what is real
how do you define real
if youre talking about your senses what you feel taste smell or see then all youre talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain
he picks up a remote control and clicks on the television
we drift through the windy city circa
this is the chicago you know
chicago as it was at the end of the twentieth century
this chicago exists only as part of a neural interactive simulation that we call the matrix
we glide at the television as he changes the channel
you have been living inside baulliaurds vision inside the map not the territory
this is chicago as it exists today
the sky is an endless sea of black and green bile
the earth scorched and split like burnt flesh spreads out beneath us as we enter the television
the desert of the real
in the distance we see the ruins of a future chicago protruding from the wasteland like the blackened ribs of a long dead corpse
we are right now miles below the earths surface
the only place humans can survive outside the matrix is underground
still moving we turn and find neo and morpheus the chairs now sitting in the middle of the black desert
dizzy neo holds onto the chair
it started early in the twenty first century with the birth of artificial intelligence a singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines
in his sunglasses we see storm clouds gather
at first all they wanted was to be treated as equals entitled to the same human inalienable rights
whatever they were given it was not enough
in the circular window of the glasses explosions light up a bloody battle field
we dont know who struck first
us or them
but sometime at the end of the twenty first century the battle was joined
we move into his glasses and the war surrounds us
the war raged for generations and turned the face of our planet from green and blue to black and red
at last we see the sentinels killing machines that are at once terrifying and beautiful
they have an organic architecture like a microbiotic organism that is perpetually in motion
the sentinel cracks the body armor of a soldier splitting open the soft stearing meat inside
it scorched and burned the sky
without the sun the machines sought out a new energy source to survive
the sentinel locks up as heat lightning of black ink bursts against the sky spreading into a permanent cloud of stain
they discovered a new form of fusion
all that was required to initiate the reaction was a small electric charge
throughout human history we have been dependent on machines to survive
fate it seems is not without a sense of irony
we return to the power plant that neo escaped from where we see human beings looking almost blissful in their gelatin cocoons
the human body generates more bio electricity than a volt battery and over b
s of body heat
outside spreading all around the power plant beneath a breathing greenhouse are the growing fields
we are as an energy source easily renewable and completely recyclable the dead liquified and fed intravenously to the living
huge farm like reapers are harvesting the crop
all they needed to control this new battery was something to occupy our mind
we see inside a clear tubular husk
floating in viscous fluid there is a human fetus its soft skull already growing around the brain jack
and so they built a prison out of our past wired it to our brains and turned us into slaves
we pull back to find the image is now on the television and we are again inside the white space of the construct
i dont believe it
its not possible
i didnt say that it would be easy neo
i just said that it would be the truth
the room without walls begins to spin
let me out
i want out
his eyes snap open and he thrashes against the chair trying to rip the cable from the back of his neck
get this thing out of me
dozer holds him while trinity unlocks it
once its out he tears away from them falling as he trips free of the harness
dont touch me
get away from me
on his hands and knees he reels as the world spins
sweat pours off him as a pressure builds inside his skull as if his brian had been put into a centrifuge
hes going to pop
vomiting violently neo pitches forward and blacks out
he blinks regaining consciousness
the room is dark
neo is stretched out on his bed
i cant go back can i
morpheus sitting like a shadow on a chair in the far corner
but if you could would you really want to
neo isnt sure of that answer
i feel that i owe you an apology
there is a rule that we do not free a mind once it reaches a certain age
it is dangerous
they have trouble letting go
their mind turns against them
ive seen it happen
i broke the rule because i had to
he stares into the darkness confessing as much to himself as neo
when the matrix was first built there was a man born inside that had the ability to change what he wanted to remake the matrix as he saw fit
it was this man that freed the first of us and taught us the secret of the war control the matrix and you control the future
when he died the oracle at the temple of zion prophesied his return and envisioned an end to the war and freedom for our people
that is why there are those of us that have spent our entire lives searching the matrix looking for him
neo can feel his eyes on him
i did what i did because i believe we have been brought here for a reason neo
you are here to serve a purpose just as i am here to serve mine
i told you i dont believe in fate
morpheus smiles leaning towards hin
but i do neo
he stands up
get some rest
youre going to need it
there is no morning there is only darkness and then the fluorescent light sticks flicker on
neo is awake in his bed staring up at the lights
the door opens and ta
nk steps inside
did you sleep
you will tonight
i guarantee it
ill be your operator
he offers his hand and neo shakes it
he notices that tank doesnt have any jacks
you dont have
me and my brother dozer we are percent pure old fashioned home grown human
right here in the real world
genuine child of zion
zion is the place man
youll see it one day
last human city
all we got left
goddamn i got to tell you im fairly excited to see what you are capable of
i mean if morpheus is right and all
were not supposed to talk
about any of that but if you are well then this is an exciting time
we got a lot to do so lets get to it
neo is plugged in hanging in one of the suspension chairs
were supposed to load all these operations programs first but this is some major boring shit
why dont we start something a little fun
tank smiles as he plops into his operators chair
he begins flipping through a tall carousel loaded with micro discs
how about sore combat training
neo reads the label on the disk
im going to learn jujitsu
tank slides the disk into neos supplement drive
smiling tank punches the load code
his body jumps against the harness as his eyes clamp shut
the monitors kick wildly as his heart pounds adrenaline surges and his brain sizzles
an instant later his eyes snap open
hey mikey he likes it
ready for more
as grey pixels slowly fill a small half empty box
it is a meter displaying how much download time is left
the title bar reads combat series of file categories flashing beneath it savate jujitsu ken po drunken boxing
morpheus walks in
how is he
tank looks at his watch rubs his eyes
ten hours straight
hes a machine
neos body spasms and relaxes as his eyes open breath hissing from his lips
he looks like he just orgasmed
he locks at morpheus
this is incredible
i know kung fu
morpheus sits in the drive chair next to hin
he nods to tank
they are standing in a very sparse japanese style dojo
this is a sparring program similar to the programmed reality of the matrix
consider this your first lesson
he assumes a fighting stance
neo assumes a similar stance cautiously circling until he gives a short cry and launches a furious attack
it is like a jackie chan movie at high speed fists and feet striking from every angle as neo presses his attack but each and every blow is blocked by
while their minds battle in the programmed reality the two bodies appear quite serene suspended in the drive chairs
tank monitors their life systems noticing that neo is wildly and chaotically lit up as opposed to the slow and steady rhythm of morpheus
dinner is up
everyone is eating bowls of single cell protein
it has a cottage cheese consistency
mouse bursts in the room
morpheus is fighting neo
all at once they bolt for the door
neos face is knotted teeth clenched as he hurls himself at morpheus
but your weakness isnt your technique
morpheus attacks him and it is like nothing we have seen
his feet and fists are everywhere taking neo apart
for every blow neo blocks five more hit their marks until neo falls
panting on his hands and knees blood spits fror his mouth speckling the white floor of the dojo
how did i beat you
you youre too fast
do you think my being faster stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place
neo is frustrated still unable to catch his breath
do you believe thats air you are breathing now
neo squints at him
if you can free your mind the body will follow
neo stands nodding
their fists fly with pneumatic speed
everyone is gathered behind tank watching the fight like watching a game of mortal combat
that boy is fast
you ever seen anyone that fast that soon tank
morpheus is right
hes got to be the one
the speed of the blows rises like a drum solo that seems impossible to sustain
neos face sheds its mask of calm with a scream
he wants to beat morpheus bad
finally a single blow catches morpheus on the side of the head knocking his glasses off
there are several gasps
i dont believe it
morpheus rubs his face
you are angry with me
its all right
i feel better
anger is a gift neo but its a heavy one
tank load the jump program
neo straightens as the dojo dissolves away like a curtain lifting leaving the two men now standing on a building rooftop in a city skyline
you have to learn to let go of that anger
you must let go of everything
a wind howls whipping morpheus long coat to the side
you must empty yourself to free your mind
morpheus spins running hard at the edge of the rooftop
he sails through the air his coat billowing out behind him like a cape somersaults once and lands on the rooftop across the street
neo looks down at the street twenty floors below then at morpheus an impossible fifty feet away
he takes a deep breath
free my mind
they are transfixed
hes gonna make it
no ones ever made their first jump
what if he does
its never been done
trinity stares at the screen her fists clenching as she whispers
summoning every ounce of strength in his legs neo launches himself into the air in a single maniacal shriek but comes up drastically short
his eyes widen as he plummets
stories fly by the ground rushing up at him but as he hits the ground gives way stretchinp like a trapeze net
he bounces and flips slowly coming to a rest flat on his back
he laughs a bit unsure wiping the wind blown tears from his face
morpheus exits the building and helps him to his feet
everyone falls the first time
neo nods quietly
if you never know failure how can you know success
they break up
what does it mean
it doesnt mean anything
everyone falls right trinity
but trinity has left
neos eyes open as tank eases the plug out
he tries to move and groans cradling his ribs
while tank helps morpheus neo spits blood into his hand
i thought it wasnt real
neo stares at the blood
if you are killed in the matrix you die here
the body cannot live without the mind
trinity enters from the hall carrying a try of food
neo i saved you some dinner she sees him passed out on the bed
she sets the tray down and pulls the blanket over him
she pauses her face close to his then inhales lightly breathing in the scent of him before slowly pulling away
it seems the moment she closes the door he wakes with a start unsure of where he is
after a moment he gets out of bed
the ship is quiet and dark
everyone is asleep
the core glows with monitor light
cypher is in the operators chair as neo cones up behind him
shit neo you scared the bejeezus out of ne
no its all right
what are you doing
neos eyes light up as he steps closer to the screens that seem alive with a constant flow of data
the monitors are packed with bizarre codes and equations
you want a drink
he pours neo a drink from a large plastic jug
ill tell you i feel for you man
i really do
most of us were still young just punks when morpheus jacked us
but you you had a real life
neo takes a sip and it almost kills him
cypher pounds on his back
good shit huh
dozer makes it
its good for two things degreasing engines and killing brain cells
red faced neo finally stops coughing
did he tell you why he did it
ill be the didnt tell you that this wasnt the first time he thought he found the one
neo shakes his head as cypher fills his cup and laughs
let me give you a piece of advice
between you and me if morpheus says you can fly i wouldnt go jumping out any windows to find out if hes right
cypher raises his drink
neo swallows another throat scorching mouthful
welcome to the real world
chamber music and the ambiance of wealth soak the room as we watch a serrated knife saw through a thick gorgeous steak
thats what he said to me nine years ago
the meat is so perfect charred on the outside oozing red juice from the inside that it could be a dream
the real world
ha what a joke
we recognize the grating voice the insidious laugh
you know what real is
ill tell you what real is
a fork stabs the cube of meat and we follow it up to the face of cypher
real is just another four letter word
he laughs shoving the steak into his mouth
the restaurant is located on the top floor of a chicago skyscraper where the view is breathtaking and the menu has no prices
sitting across from cypher is agent smith
do we have a deal mr
cypher chews the steak loudly smacking it between his teeth
mmm so so fucking good
smith watches him shovel another hunk of meat into his mouth
you know i know that this steak doesnt exist
i know when i put it in my mouth the matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious
after nine years do you know what ive realized
pausing he examines the meat skewered on his fork
he pops it in eyes rolling up savoring the tender beef melting in his mouth
ignorance is bliss
then we have a deal
i dont want to remember nothing
and i want to be rich
like an actor
you can do that right
whatever you want mr
cypher takes a deep drink of wine
you get my body back in a power plant reinsert me into the matrix and ill get you what you want
access codes to zion
i told you i dont know them
but i can give you the man who does
sweat dapples his lip as neo snaps out of the construct coma
jeez i was wondering about that
why i was bald here but not in the matrix
residual self image
now whats this
he points to one of neos monitors
life systems monitor glucose levels
main power supply to the core
he follows tank to the operators station where he points to a red key switch
how about this
mainframe self destruct
uses all remaining power to generate an
our best weapon against the machines
the problem is if someone is still in the matrix when that thing goes off theyre not coming back
neo nods as morpheus comes up behind them
hows he doing
we just finished the operation programs and hes showing great retention
i want everyone alerted to hour stand by
were going in
neo its time for you to know why youre here
morpheus walks away
whats he talking about
hes taking you into the matrix to see her
neo looks down at the monitor teeming with matrix data that seems to coalesce equations giving way to images as a metal scream rises becoming an el train
the room is empty heavy curtains covering windows
it looks as if it hasnt been touched in years
in the bedroom with the cracked oval mirror an old black phone begins to ring
in the mirror we first glimpse them and as we keep turning the room fills with equipment and the team
morpheus answers the phone
he hangs up
mouse and cable hold the exit
neo follows the others down the stairwell that winds around an antique elevator shaft
did you have to do this
what did she tell you
lots of things
any of them true
trinity looks at him then looks away
some of them
were they good or bad
theres no point in worrylng
whatever is going to happen is going to happen
they cross the old lobby
switch and apoc stop at the doors
we should be back in an hour
neo squints into the sun that seems unnaturally bright
he is the only one without sunglasses
do you now understand what it means when we say if youre not one of us youre one of them
theyre sentient programs
they can commandeer any software hardwired to the mainframe
anyone that is still in a power plant
that is why we try to be invisible in the matrix
the best hacking is always traceless
cypher and trinity move away from them securing the perimeter
as cypher passes a garbage can he surreptitiously drops something inside
it is a cellular phone and we watch the blue display as the line connects
an early s black lincoln continental emerges from a corrugated roll up garage
morpheus and neo get in
an enormous man is waiting for them
a wad of chewing tobacco bulges his cheek
he spits into a coke can
morpheus been a long time coming
youre looking well mojo
mojo coughs a brown cankerous laugh juice speckling his chin and shirt
he stares at neo
you bringing us geriatrics now
he spits and laughs again
guess you are locking for a miracle
the continental pulls up to a bar in the kind of neighborhood where every corner has a pair of eyes
a lightless lower class bar
no one enters that is not expected
the front doors open in a brilliant burst of sunlight as mojo leads morpheus and neo inside
neo looks around his eyes adjusting to the darkness
mojo talks to the bartender then looks over
all right its cool
go on back
they weave their way to the back of the bar the sticky floor snapping under their feet
a monolith of a man rises from his stool as they walk up
he moves to the side opening the heavy iron door behind him
they descend the basement staircase toward the single bare bulb at the bottom hanging above the only door
a high tech laptop and modem are set up on a stack of milk crates
neo waits as morpheus types in a series of access codes
after a moment the screen blinks welcome morpheus
morpheus walks back to the same door they entered but it now leads into the walls and floors are polished marble
neo follows his mouth agape
what what happened
this is the temple
it is a part of zions mainframe
its hidden inside the matrix so that we can access it
two priestesses are waiting in the antechamber
weve been expecting you
okay youre on your own
go with them
they take neo by the arm leading him down a hall into another room
among the other potentials
neo enters and finally understands the attention given to his age
the potentials are all little children
the room feels at once like a buddhist temple and a kindergarten class
the childrens heads are either shaved or thick with dreadlocks
some are playing others meditating or practicing their gift
neo watches a little girl levitate wooden alphabet blocks
a skinny boy holds a spoon which sways like a blade of grass as he bends it with his rnind
neo crosses to him sits
the boy smiles as neo picks up a spoon and tries to imitate him
despite his best efforts neo cannot make it bend
your spoon does not bend because it is just that a spoon
mine bends because there is no spoon just my mind
neo watches as it curls into a knot
link yourself to the spoon
become the spoon and bend yourself
neo nods again holding up his spoon
there is no spoon
the spoon begins to bend just as the priestess touches his shoulder
the oracle will see you now
spoon boy smiles
neo enters nervously
beneath his feet is a path of the zodiac leading to marbled stairs that rise to a dais and a three legged throne
the throne is empty
a distant female voice calls to him and he follows it up the stairs
at the top of the dais he smells something cooking
following the scent he moves behind the pillars where he finds an open door
just come on in
he walks through a vestibule where he sees a fabulous moonstone headdress and velvet robes
a second door leads into it looks like a suburban tract house
there is a lot of cozy furniture a dining roon hutch filled with china shelves and tables crowded with doilies knick knacks and ceramic brick a brack
neo follows the plastic carpet runner to the kitchen
a woman is huddled beside the oven peering inside through the cracked door
be right with you
youre the oracle
i got to say i love seeing you non believers
its really a relief
all that pomp and circumstances just plain tucker me out
smell good dont they
id ask you to sit down but youre not going to anyway
and dont worry about the vase
he turns to look around and his elbow knocks a vase from the table
it breaks against the linoleum floor
shit im sorry
she pulls out a tray of chocolate chip cookies and turns
she is an older woman wearing big oven mitts comfortable slacks and a print blouse
she looks like someones grandma
i said dont worry about it
ill get one of my kids to fix it
how did you know
she sets the cookie tray on a wooden hot pad
whats really going to bake your noodle later on is would you still have broken it if i hadnt said anything
smiling she lights a cigarette
youre cuter than i thought
i see why she likes you
not too bright though
you know why morpheus brought you to see me
i think so
what do you think
you think youre the one
i dont know
she gestures to a wooden plaque the kind every grandma has except that the words are in latin
you know what that means
means know thyself
she puts her cigarette down
well lets have a look at you
she widens his eyes checks his ears then feels the glands in his neck
open your mouth
she nods then looks at his palms
you sure got the gift but its tricky
id say the bad news is youre not the one
still got a lot to learn
maybe next life
whats the good news
same as the bad news youre not the one
is that it then
she picks up the tray of cooling cookies
you better take a cookie
got a big day ahead of you
he eyes her then takes a cookie
make a believer out of you yet
morpheus rises from a bench as the priestess escorts neo out
when they are alone morpheus puts his hand on neos shoulder
you dont have to tell me anything neo because i already know what she said
i brought you so that you could hear it for yourself
i knew it would help
neo finishes his cookie
no one will ever ask you because it is a gift from her
it is for you and you alone
storm clouds shroud the streets as the sky turns jaundice
cypher nervously glances down the surrounding streets
he notices several unmarked white vans
he mops the sweat from his forehead when trinity sees the black lincoln
here they come
in the hovercraft we see the sweat rolling down cyphers face and neck
tank is typing rapidly at the keyboard
this area never has this much activity
apoc opens the side door and they enter the hotel
mouses cellular rings
welcome to movie phone
theyre on their way
the phone flips shut as he jumps up
lets get to work
light filters down the throat of the building through a caged skylight at the top of the open elevator shaft
four figures glide up the dark stairs that wind around the antique elevator
neo notices a black cat a yellow green eyed shadow that slinks past them and pads quickly down the stairs
a moment later neo sees another black cat that looks and moves identically to the first one
those words stop the others dead in their tracks
the monitors suddenly glitch as though the matrix had an electronic seizure
trinity turns around her face tight
what did you just say
just had a little deja vu
what did you see
a black cat went past us and then i saw another that looked just like it
how much like it
was it the same cat
it might have been
im not sure
trinity looks at morpheus who listens quietly to the rasping breath of the old building
what is it
a deja vu is usually a glitch in the matrix
it happens when they change something
she also listens as the staccato beat of helicopter blades grow ominously louder
tank sees what was changed
its a trap
morpheus looks up the stairs as a helicopter shadow passes over the clouded glass
cable goes to the draped windows
did you just feel something weird
the cellular rings
heavy bolt cutters snap through the main phone cable
mouse answers the phone
whats going on
they cut the hard line
its a trap
cable yanks open the curtain
the windows are bricked up
the door to the roof explodes open as heavily armed rnen rush towards room
tank watches helplessly
no no no
the door slams open and the police force pours in dozens of assault rifles surrounding mouse and cable who are armed with only handguns
its a trap morpheus stops as the scream is drowned by the report of machine guns filling the building with a terrible fury
mouses body thrashes against its harness as bullets pound him against the blood splattered brick window
gun smoke thickens the room cable blasting and moving until the hammer clicks empty
he screams as a dozen guns open fire ripping him apart
blood spits from cables mouth his body spasming then lying perfectly still
the flat line alarm softly cries out from the life monitors of the two dead men
more police cars arrive as cops break open the lobby doors
flying downstairs morpheus stops hearing the police swarming below
he turns and rushes down the hall of the eighth floor
at the end of it he finds the bricked up windows
thats what they changed
theres no way out
the sound of heavy boot steps close around them with the mechanical sureness of a vice
give me your phone
theyll be able to track it
we have no choice
tank answers the call
tank find a structural drawing of this building and find it fast
his fingers pound the keyboard
flashlights probe the rotting darkness as the police search every floor
the diagram windows onto the screen
i need the main wet wall
agent smith pauses his hand going to his earpiece
morpheus is guided by tank
now left and thats it in front of you
he cuts off the phone
agent smith hears the line click dead
theyre on the eighth floor
agent brown hears smith on his earphone
cops flood the eighth floor rushing everywhere
several cops sweep through the room
it is empty
as they pass the bathroom we see a man sized hole smashed through the plaster and lathe
they are inside the main plumbing wall slowly worming their way down the greasy black stack pipes
above them light fills the hole they made to get inside
brown turns to smith
where are they
the cops search in silence straining for a clue when one hears something strange near the bathroom
cypher has slipped and is wedged between the wall and several thick supply pipes
the cop leans in his ear almost against the thin membrane of plaster separating them
he can hear whispers hisses and a grunt when the wall suddenly bulges shatter cracking as the cop realizes theyre in the walls
neo pulls cypher free just as the cop opens fire bullets punching shafts of light like swords into the box of soot black space
the cop keeps firing his flashlight strapped to his gun barrel lighting up the wall until a bullet spits out his forehead
agent smith watches the body fall with a thud
are orders that hard to follow
ill say it again
morpheus must be taken alive
theyre almost falling theyre climbing so fast
above them plaster is smashed open as crunbling bits shower down on them filling the crawlway with dust
agent smith looks into the open wall at the exposed intestines of the building and realizes where they are going
how like a rodent
just below a rifle butt smashes open the wall light raking across the lathe
i got him
i got him
trinity finds her gun first
bullet holes pop out the wall as she strafes the room sending cops diving for cover
they continue trinity exposed for a roment when a creeping cop smashes a fist through and grabs a fistful of her hair
he starts to yank her out when neo kicks his boot bursting through plaster and splintering lathe knocking the cop out
they then quickly sink out of sight
this part of the basement a dark concrete cavern was the main mechanical room
there are four enormous boilers dinosaur like technology that once pumped hot water like arteries
black and bloody they squeeze out from the ceiling into the tangled web of pipes
their enemies are waiting for them
blinding lights cut open the darkness as gas masked figures fire grenade launchers
smoke blossoms from the green metal canisters
morpheus never stops moving
searching the floor he finds what
he needs the cover of the catch basin
cypher watches him pry open the grate when a gas can bounces near him
cypher seems to trip as the cloud envelops him
cyphers body begins to shiver uncontrollably
morpheus watches cypher disappear into the smoke then follows the others down the wet black hole
they crawl through greasy black water in a three foot diameter pipe that feeds into the sewer main
gas masked apparitions find the open hole
cypher is carried out hand cuffed his body still shaking mucus bubbling out his nose
as he is led past agent smith it almost seems that both men smile
we have them now
neo punches out the screen and then spills down into the main water trough
oily water forms around them as they wade across the man made underground river towards the service catwalk
neo is about to pull himself out when he sees them coming
flashlights and laser sites sweep at them as cops in helmets and heavy armor looking more nachine than human fill both ends of the tunnel
there is a single manhole cover above them
morpheus whispers to trinity
you have to get neo out
thats all that matters now
morpheus dont he must get out
do you understand me
a font of water erupts as morpheus leaps for the manhole ladder his coat flying open like the wings of a manta ray
there he is
pools of light wash over him as he hauls himself to the surface
hes heading for the street
trinity urges the others to follow her
grabbing neo they wade quietly away from the chaos
morpheus shoots out of the sewer but the police are waiting for him
the closest cop is armed with a tranquilized gun
he fires but morpheus is too fast using the manhole cover as a shield blocking the darts then frisbee ing it into the cops armored chest knocking him off his
the cops lunge at him but every part of his body is a deadly weapon moving with impossible speed
it seems he might fight his way out when he throws a spinning back fist that is caught by agent smith
so we meet at last
and you are
i am agent smith
you all look the same to me
ive been waiting for this noment
faster than a snake spits morpheus cracks smith with a jaw breaking right
oh so have i
agent smith smiles
trinity leads the others fading into the darkness of the tunnel lit only with shafts of lights streaming through the street drains as we rise towards them through a grate
into the fight
smith and morpheus exchange a furious serious of blows that is witnessed but not believed by the surrounding police
agent smith delivers a punishing kick that staggers morpheus
you cant win
i already have
he stands up and drops his fists a steely resolve in his eyes
cops swarm over morpheus
tank reaches out to the screen as if reaching for morpheus
cuff ed and beaten morpheus is thrown into a caged transport vehicle
the door clangs shut
agent jones finds agent smith
the others were lost
youve taken care of reagan
agent jones nods
then the others do not matter
a manhole cover cracks open
two eyes peek out just as a truck rattles over it
the thunder dopplers away and the cover opens
neo trinity switch and apoc climb out
trinity pulls a water logged phone from her pocket
we need a phone
tank is again at the monitors searching the matrix
we gotta find the others
theyre still alive
the phone rings
i need an exit
i thought they had you
cypher is standing at a public phone
across the street is the burning paddy wagon that appears to have collided witli an oncoming car
there was an accident
a fucking car accident
all of a sudden
theyre all dead
i still got the shakes but jesus someones going to make a believer out of me
dozer spots the wreck
there he is
i got you
just get me outta here
nearest exit is franklin and erie
an old appliance store
cypher hangs up and smiles as the fire trucks arrive
the phone rings
tank its me
they are outside a pawn shop
trinity has a new cellular
we need an exit
youre not far from cypher
cypher i thought so did we
that boys got nine lives
i sent him to franklin and erie
she hangs up
running cypher turns onto erie
dead machines eviscerated and shrouded with dust lay on metal shelves like bodies in a morgue
plywood covering a small window is ripped off and cypher crawls inside
deep in the back room a phone that has not rung in years begins to ring
tank punches the emit command
cyphers body twitches in its harness jerking itself awake
his eyes blink open
dozer unplugs him
system check looks fine
cypher stands a raspy cough spewing from his lungs
trinity sees the appliance shop
cypher holds his chest
my lungs are killing me
he crosses to an overhead bin
we got any pain killers
the first aid kits over here
as dozer stoops for a cabinet cypher pulls back a heavy blanket exposing a plasma rifle
neo crawls through the window that cypher opened
tank finishes loading the exit programs as cypher rises behind him swinging the weapon at his back
he looks over as dozer turns with the first aid kit a look of frozen disbelief crossing his face no
tank spins as red hot wads of plasma explode through his chair and into his back
diving a second burst tears up his side as dozer shoots a look at the monitor where tank was working
he stabs the enter command activating the exit sequence and ducks under a barrage of plasma fire the phone begins to ring as the others crawl in
god i love that sound
dozer rolls up grabbing a heavy crowbar from a box of tools
cypher circles the drive chairs as the sights of the plasma rifle find dozers face
dozer charges screaming and the plasma rifle screams back
the phone is still ringing
neo answers the phone when there is a click
there is no signal
nothing but silence
i dont know
it just went dead
trinity listens to the dead line and takes out the cellular
the operator phone begins to ring cypher steps over the body of tank and looks at the monitor
trinity can almost feel him watching them
every unanswered ring wrings her gut a little tighter until hello trinity
he had an accident
what about dozer
is dozer there
he walks over to trinitys body staring down at it hanging in its coma like stillness
you know for a long time i thought i was in love with you trinity
i used to dream about you
he nuzzles his face against hers feeling the softness of it
you are a beautiful woman
too bad things had to work out like this
we intercut between the appliance store and the main deck
you killed them
wearing tanks operator headgear cypher moves among the silent bodies
in a way youre very lucky
most people never know why they die
one minute theyre alive the next theyre dead
thats why i thought maybe i should tell you
it seemed the least i could do
he stands over the body of morpheus as his anger boils up out of him
you see the truth the real truth is that the war is over
its been over for a long time
and guess what
did you hear that
we lost the war
what about zion
zion is a part of this delusion
more of this madness
thats why this has to be done
it has to end
now and forever
she suddenly sees the entire dark plan
oh rny god
this is abzut zion
you gave them morpheus for the access codes to zion
cypher walks away from morpheus and bends down next to apocs body
you see trinity we humans have a place in the future
but its not here
its in the matrix
the matrix isnt real
oh i disagree trinity
i think the matrix is more real than this world
i mean all i do is pull a plug here
but there you watch a man die
he grabs hold of the cable in apocs neck twists it and yanks it out
you tell me which is more real
apoc seems to go blind for an instant a scream caught in his throat his hands reaching for nothing and then falls dead
welcome to the real world right
somehow some way youre going to pay for this
pay for it
im not even going to remember it
itll be like it never happened
the tree falling in the forest
it doesnt make a sound
his hand slides around the neck of switch as he takes hold of her plug
she suddenly feels her body severed from her mind as she is murdered
goddamn you cypher
dont hate me trinity
im just the messenger
and right now im going to prove that the message is true
he stands over neo
if morpheus was right then theres no way i can pull this plug is there
she turns to neo eyes wide with fear and he knows he is next
if he is the one then in the next few seconds there has to be some kind of miracle to stop me
because if he dies like the others that means morpheus was wrong
how can he be the one if hes dead
he takes hold of the cord when she hears an explosion and a scream
cypher is on the ground his left leg blown off at the knee
he rolls over and finds tank on the ground and the sights of the plasma rifle
hows it feel cypher
knowing youre about to die
cypher lunges for neos plug just as tank blows his head off
theyre both listening trying to figure out what is happening when the store phone starts to ring
trinity smiles tears moistening her eyes as neo throws his arms around her
for a moment it looks as if they might kiss before trinity lets go
we should we should hurry
trinitys eyes open a sense of relief surging through her at the sight of the ship
as tank unplugs her she sees his charred wounds
tank youre hurt
ill be all right
tanks face tightens
im sorry tank
a japanese luxury hotel in downtown chicago
a military helicopter sets down on the roof
heavily armed marines begin to deploy
agent jones gets out of the helicopter flanked by columns of marines
they open the roof access door and enter the top floor maintenance level of the hotel
they get in the elevator
at every door at least two marines stop and post guard
they exit the elevator and walk to the presidential suite the final two marines post guard
inside he finds agent smith
there is a problem
reagan has failed to secure the hardware
agent smith stares out the window
never send a human to do a machines job
but if reagan has failed why havent they pulled the plug
havent you learned by now that it is impossible to understand why they do the things they do
continue as planned
trace his signal to locate their position and deploy an extermination unit
morpheus is handcuffed to a chair stripped to the waist
he is bleeding from numerous wounds and is pumped full of serum alternately shivering and sweating
he is hooked up to various monitors with white disk electrodes
agent brown begins running a trace program
neo looks at morpheus whose body is covered with a cold sweat
what are they doing to him
theyre cracking his mind
they inject virus like serums to break down the system
its like cracking a computer
all it takes is time
how much time
depends on the mind
but eventually it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this
tank punches several commands on morpheus personal unit
the monitor waves change from a chaotic pattern to an orderly symmetrical one
when it does morpheus will tell them anything they want to know
the access codes to zion
if an agent got inside zions mainframe he could do anything
disable the defense system
it would be the end of us
he looks up at trinity who is pacing relentlessly
we cant let that happen
we have to do it trinity
zion has to be protected
trinity sees cyphers dead body
rage overtakes her and she starts kicking hin
we have to pull the plug
we dont have any other choice
those words are like using gasoline to put out a fire and we watch the pain in her eyes burn into a blaze
she walks past him and gets into her chair
trinity what are you doing
im going in after him
morpheus could conform at any minute if he does im sure youll do what has to be done
you saw that place
she glares at him
i know what morpheus means to you no
no i dont think you do
if you did then you would know that im not letting him go
not without a fight tank
she yanks her harness tight
not without a fight
agent smith stands in the bedroon of the enormous suite staring out the windows at the city below shimmering with brilliant sunlight
have you ever stood and stared at it morpheus
marveled at its beauty
billions of people just living out their lives
agent brown sucks a serum from a glass vial filling a hypodermic needle
did you know that the first matrix was designed to be a perfect human world
where none suffered where everyone would be happy
it was a disaster
no one would accept the program
entire crops were lost
agent brown jams the needle into morpheus shoulder and plunges down
some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world
but i believe that as a species human beings define their reality through suffering and misery
agent brown studies the screens as the life signs react violently to the injection
the perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from
which is why the matrix was re designed to this the peak of your civilization
he turns from the window
i say your civilization because as soon as we start thinking for you it really becomes our civilization which is of course what this is all about
he sits down directly in front of morpheus
he lifts morpheus head
like the dinosaur
look out that window
you had your time
morpheus stares hard at him trying hard not to show the pain racking his mind
the future is our world morpheus
the future is our time
neo goes to his chair and begins strapping in
what do you think youre doing
you need help
im coming with you
morpheus sacrificed himself so you could escape
theres no way youre going back in
morpheus did what he did because he believed that im something that im not
im not the one trinity
the oracle told me
trinity is stunned
she said i had a gift but i still had a lot to learn
she told me maybe next life
did you tell morpheus
it wouldnt mean anything
hed still believe what he wanted to believe
but morpheus is the one that matters
hes more important than me and we both know it
he straps in
i may not be what morpheus thinks i am but if i dont try to help him then im not even what i think i am
what are you
agent smith sits casually across from morpheus who is hunched over his body leaking and twitching
id like to share a revelation that ive had during my time here
it came to me when i tried to classify your species
ive realized that you are not actually mammals
the life signs continue their chaotic patterns
every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment
but you humans do not
you move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area
he leans forward
there is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern
do you know what it is
human beings are a disease a cancer of this planet
you are a plague
and we are
trinity and neo hang motionless in the suspension unit
tank is at the operations station
what do you need
lots of guns
coming right up
he loads the weapons disk
racks of weapons appear and neo and trinity arm themselves
no one has ever done anything like this
he snap cocks an uzi
thats why its going to work
agent smith is again at the window
why isnt the serum working
perhaps we are asking the wrong questions
or he doesnt know
of course he knows
i dont know
if i knew
agent smith hides his knotting fist
he is becoming angry
it is something that isnt supposed to happen to agents
leave me with him
agent brown and jones look at each other
tank sits down beside morpheus whose face is ashen like someone near death
he takes hold of his hand
hold on morpheus
theyre coming for you
a dark wind blows
in long black coats trinity and neo push through the revolving doors
neo is carrying a duffel bag
trinity has a large metal suitcase
they cut across the lobby drawing nervous glances
dark glasses game faces
several plainclothes cops try to stop them
they are met by the muted spit of a silenced gun and the razored whistle of throwing stars
the cops slump down to the marbled floor while neo and trinity do not even break stride
agent smith leans close to morpheus whispering to him
can you hear me morpheus
im going to be honest with you
he removes his earphone letting it dangle over his shoulder
i hate this place
this reality whatever you want to call it i cant stand it any longer
its the smell if there is such a thing
i feel saturated by it
i can taste your stink and every time i do i fear that ive somehow been infected by it
he wipes sweat from morpheus forehead coating the tips of his fingers holding them to morpheus nose
repulsive isnt it
he lifts morpheus head holding it tightly with both hands
i must get out of here i must get free
in this mind is tlie key
morpheus sneers through his pain
once zion is gone theres no need for me to be here
do you understand
i need the codes
i have to get inside zion
you have to tell me how
he begins squeezing his fingers gouging into his flesh
the skull is about to shatter when agents jones and brown burst into the room
agent smith releases morpheus
what were you doing
agent smith recovers replacing his ear piece
you dont know
agent smith listens to his earphone not believing what he is hearing
they get in
trinity immediately drops and opens the suitcase wiring a plastique and napalm bomb
beneath their trench coats is an arsenal of weapons slung from climbing harnesses
neo hits the emergency stop
he pulls down part of the false ceiling and finds the elevator shaft access panel
agent jones looks at morpheus
i think theyre trying to save him
neo ratchets down a clamp onto the elevator cable
both of them lock on
he looks up the long dark throat of the building and takes a deep breath
there is no spoon
neo whips out his gun and presses it to the cable lower than where they attached themselves
the cable snaps
the counter weights plummet yanking trinity and neo up through the shaft as the elevator falls away beneath them distending space filling it with the sound of whistling metal as
they soar to the top
the elevator hits the botton
the massive explosion blows open the doors fire clouds engulfing the elevator section of the lobby
the agents hear the blast and fire alarms
lower level they are actually attacking
hanging by a rope trinity hot wires the panel for the door
nervous the marines watch as the elevator dings softly and slides open
black smoke rises out of the exposed shaft
the nearest marine eases to the edge peering down at the churning blaze engulfing the lower levels
he does not see trinity and neo above him until it is too late
neo kicks knocking the marine flying down into the shaft
before the others can react trinity flips out into the hall decking the nearest marine
neo cracks another
the fight is over before it begins
an enormous explosion thunders above them shaking the building
the alarm sounds emergency sprinklers begin showering the room
agent smith smashes a table
find them and destroy them
agent jones nods and touches his ear piece
the roof access tower is now engulfed in flames as neo and trinity lay waste to a dozen more marines
guns and knives like extensions of their bodies used with the same deadly precision as their feet and their fists
across the roof the pilot inside the army helicopter watches the ferocious onslaught
i repeat we are under attack
suddenly his face his whole body dissolves consumed by spreading locust like swarm of static as agent jones emerges
just as she drops the last marine trinity sees whats coming
neo sees her the fear in her face and he knows what is behind him
screaming he whirls guns filling his hands with thought speed
fingers pumping shells ejecting dancing up and away we look through the sights and gun smoke at the agent blurred with motion until the hammers click against empty metal
agent jones charges
his gun booms as we enter the liquid space of bullet time
the air sizzles with wads of lead like angry flies as neo twists bends ducks just between them
agent jones still running narrows the gap the bullets coming faster until neo bent impossibly back one hand on the ground as a spiraling gray ball shears open his shoulder
he starts to scream as another digs a red groove across his thigh
he has only time to look up to see the barrel when agent jones standing over him pulls the trigger the final time
neo rolls reaching for another gun when around house kick snaps his jaw
agent jones grabs the gun and levels it at neo
suddenly agent jones stops
something is wrong
he scans the roof
trinity is gone
immediately he whirls around and turns straight into the muzzle of her
jammed right into his head
dodge this motherfucker
the body flies back with a flash of mercurial light and when it hits the ground it is the pilot
trinity helps neo up
youre hit im fine
neo is already looking at the helicopter
can you fly that thing
she pulls out a cellular phone
tank is back at the controls
tank i need a pilot program for a military m helicopter
tank is immediately searching the disk drawers
his fingers flash over the gleaming laser disks finding one that he feeds into trinityls supplement drive punching the load cormands on her keyboard
trinitys eyes flutter as information surges into her brain all the essentials of flying a helicopter absorbed at light speed
marines trying to communicate with the men on the roof are beginning to panic when agent jones comes around the corner
there was gunfire weve lost communication with the roof
remain at your posts
but sir the fire we should evacuate
you will do as you are ordered
agent jones marches into the presidential suite
agent jones throws open the bedroom door and enters walking through the puddles pooling in the carpet
over the rushing water and the alarms agent smith hears a sound and understands the seriousness of the attack
he turns to the wall of windows as the helicopter drops neo is in the back bay aiming the mounted
the gun jumps and bullets explode through the window in a cacophony of crashing glass as the agents go for their weapons
but neo is too close the
caliber too fast and bullets are everywhere perforating the room
agent smith is hit first his body jack knifing back blood arcing out with a sudden flash of light then agent brown his gun still firing as his body falls
and finally agent jones
neo stares at morpheus trying to will him into action
get up morpheus
morpheus sits unmoving his head still down
neo grabs the climbing rope just as marines burst into the adjoining room
he attaches only one end to his harness when they open quickly he swings the gun spraying the other room windows shattering furniture exploding marines diving for cover
just outside the presidential suite three marines blister with snow static
morpheus lifts his face into the rooms rain
his eyes still white begin to blink twitch then close
and when he opens them they are again dark and flashing with fire
the agents knife into the room firing even as neos bullet trails chase them
morpheus strains at his handcuffs
the agents and the marines turn the tide blasting lead ricocheting pock marking the copter
firing wildly neo turns to see morpheus rising snapping the handcuffs starting for the window
agent smith stops and sees morpheus run past the open bedroom door
he fires sweeping across the sheetrocked wall in a perfect line
for an instant we see the bullets shred puncturing the wall searing through the wet air with jet trails of chalk
and as morpheus starts to dive for the window a bullet buries itself in his leg knocking him off balance
he wont make it
morpheus lunges out of control as neo spins every move a whip crack snapping the other rope end onto a bolted bar
morpheus begins to fall when neo hurls himself into the wide blue empty space flying for a moment
the rope snaking out behind him an umbilical cord attached to a machine
as their two bodies set in motion rushing at each other on a seemingly magnetic course until they collide
almost bouncing free of each other arms legs scrambling hands searching in furious desperation finding hold and clinging
until the line ends snapping taut cracking their fragile embrace
morpheus tumbles legs flipping over falling down the ground deliriously distant as neo snatches hold of his mentors still handcuffed wrist
trinity is already pulling the copter up and away
as agent smith grabs the m from the nearest marine
hell bring them all down
targeting the helicopter he aims at something only he can see the oil line
the rear hull is punched full of holes and smoke and oil pours out like black blood
shit shit no
neo is pulling morpheus up to him when he hears the oh fuck
trinity throws the helicopter towards the roof of the nearest building
morpheus and neo cling to one another as they and the machine above them begin to fall
the engine grinds the chopping blades start to slow while the agents stand in the open shattered window watching the helicopter disappear behind taller buildings
carried by its nomentum trinity guides the parabolic fall over the nearest roof where neo and morpheus drop safely rolling free as the rope goes slack
neo gets to his feet trying to detach himself but the helicopter is falling too fast arcing over the roof like a setting sun the coils of slack snap taught
yanking neo off his feet dragging him with ferocious speed towards the edge even as trinity lunges for the back door her gun in one hand grabbing for the rope with the other neo flies like a skipping stone hurtling straight at us when his feet hit the rain gutter a fulcrum that levers him up just as trinity fires severing the cord from the helicopter falling free of it as it smashes blades first into a glass skyscraper
holding onto the rope she swings connected to neo who stands on the buildings edge watching her arc beneath him as the helicopter explodes she bounces against a shatterproof window
that spider cracks out while flames erupt behind her
tank stares at the screen his mouth agape
hes the one
hes got to be
neo pulls trinity up into his arms
both shaking they hold each other again
i knew it
i goddamn knew it
she runs at him throwing her arms around him
do you believe me now
hes the one
who else could have done this
morpheus i know you wont believe me but the oracle told ne im not the one
it doesnt matter if i dont believe you his eyes light up
what matters is that you dont believe her
the phone rings
tank get us out of here
got one ready
an underground el station
state and balbo
see ya soon
line goes dead
tank looks at the bodies and smiles
see ya soon
the rope is all that remains
agent smith can barely control his anger
the trace was completed
we have their position
the extermination unit is in place
order the strike
agent smith cant stand listening to them
he moves to the edge of the building looking out at the surrounding city
theyre not out yet
a metal gate is locked the sign reading station closed
neo looks around takes out a gun and blows off the lock
in the moist underground distance they hear the muted ring of a telephone
the phone is ringing inside a graffiti covered booth
across from it sitting hunched against the red concrete wall is an old man
he stares at the ringing phone taking a final pull off his t bird
no one is around
it continues to ring
determined he stands and walks to the booth
he is about to answer the phone when neo sees him
the old man stops neo rushes at hin gliding smoothly over the turnstiles
im sorry i didnt mean
the old man is shaking terrified
neo looks at his gun
he glances over his shoulder then eases back the hammer
get outta here
the old man nods turns and hurries deeper into the urban cave disappearing into the shadows as trinity and morpheus arrive
was that it was nobody
neo turns to the ringing booth
you first morpheus
morpheus gets in and answers the phone
lost in the shadow the old man turns back and watches as morpheus disappears the phone dropping dangling by its cord
his eyes grow wide glowing white in the dark
agent smith stares his face twisted with hate
he will never be free of the matrix
he starts to turn from the edge of the building when he suddenly hears it his head whipping back around staring as the old man stares
trinity hangs up the phone
she turns to neo standing close enough to kiss him
morpheus is right you know
it doesnt matter what he believes or even what the oracle believes
what matters is what you believe
he stares at the fullness of her lips
i want to kiss you
i want to kiss you too
the phone begins to ring
but i want it to be real
she pulls herself away and gets into the booth when something catches neos eye and he looks to where the old man had been
she hears him scream and sees agent smith emerge as if formed by congealing darkness charging with a fistful of metal
the gun fires the bullet flying at her bursting through the plastic window just as trinity disappears
the handset hanging in the air as the bullet hits shattering the ear piece
trinity blinks shivering as her conscious exits the construct
what the hell just happened
you have to send me back
gun report thunders through the underground both men blasting moving at impossible speed
for a blinking noment we enter bullet time
gun flash tongues curl from neols gun bullets float forward like a plane noving across the sky cartridges cartwheel into space
an instant later they are nearly on top of each other rolling up out of a move that is almost a mirrored reflection of the other each jamming their gun
tight to the others head
they freeze in a kind of embrace neo sweating panting agent smith machine calm
agent smith smiles
neo pulls the trigger
so are you
the smile falls
agent smith yanks his trigger
agent smiths face warps with rage and he attacks fist flying at furious speed blows and counters neo retreating as a knife hand opens his forearm and a kick sends
him slamming back against a steel column
stunned he ducks just under a punch that crunches into the beam steel chunks exploding like shrapnel
behind him neo leaps into the air delivering a neck snapping reverse round house
agent smiths glasses fly off and he glares at neo his eyes ice blue
you cant win
i already have
he attacks with a vicious series of blows but the agent seems to absorb them waiting for his opening
and this time agent smiths attack is too much an unrelenting fury fists pounding like jackhammers
trinity watches neo as his body jerks mouth coughing blood his life signs going wild
jesus hes killing him
agent smith grabs hold of him lifting him into the air hurling him against the curved wall of the train tunnel where he falls inches from the electrified third rail
the agent is about to jump down and press his attack when he hears sonething
from deep in the tunnel like an animal cry a burst of high speed metal grinding against metal
the sound of an on coming train
tank is trying to find another entrance
send me back tank
im looking trinity
from the cockpit an alarm sounds
morpheus hurries to the front console typing bringing up the radar
trinity follows him
what is it
in every pipe surrounding them they see the extermination unit
the killing machine we saw in the history program blister by us like tracer bullets shot down the throat of the abyss
neo tries to get up
agent smith jumps down onto the tracks and drop kicks him in the face
the world begins to shake rumbling as the train nears
do you hear that mr
agent smith grabs neo in a choke hold forcing him to look down the tracks the trains headlight burning a hole in the darkness
that is the sound of inevitability
neo sees it coming and he starts to fight
it is the sound of your death
there is another metal screech much louder closer as agent smith tightens his hold
neo is unable to breathe
the train roars at them swallowing agent smiths words
the veins bulge in neos head as he grits through the pain
he is not ready to die
my name is neo
impossibly he hurls himself straight up smashing smith against the concrete ceiling of the tunnel
they fall as the sound and fury of the train explodes into the station
neo back flips up off the tracks just as the train barrels over agent smith
neo stands knees shaking when the train slams on its emergency brake
with an ear splitting shriek of tortured rails the train slows part of it still in the station
neo turns limping starting to run racing for the escalator as the train comes to a stop and the doors of the last car open agent smith bursts out in
furious pursuit his glasses again intact
morpheus checks the ships self destruct key
you cant use that until neo is out
dont worry hell make it
a man sits in his mercedes talking on his car phone when his door is thrown open
neo yanks him out and jumps in
further down the street agent smith slows calmly touching his ear piece
neo throws the car across traffic rocketing down a side street
driving like a demon with one hand he grabs the car phone and dials long distance
wizard get me the fuck out of here
looking over his shoulder watching the mirrors neo drives almost unconsciously
i got some serious pursuit
the keyboard clicking tank searches for an exit
trinity screams into the headset
neo you better get your ass back here
im trying trinity
i got one
neo glances to his right and sees agent brown now driving the car beside his
agent brown swerves slamming into him
wabash and lake
neo fights the steering wheel as agent brown pushes the car up over the median
neo drops the phone as his car bucks into the opposing lane directly into the charging path of an enormous truck driven by agent smith
neo dives from the mercedes as the truck plows into it rending metal and glass crushing through totaling other cars as it explodes
neo is up and running even as orange and black clouds billow up behind hin
three figures silhouette by the burning wreckage become the three agents
further down the street neo hauls his broken bleeding ass
agents brown and smith slow touching their ear pieces as agent jones continues chasing full bore
neo spins around a corner racing toward a hotel called the heart of chicago hotel
only agent jones is behind him now
neo dives into the alley
at the far end he sees agent brown charging
neo leaps for the fire escape and begins to climb
sentinels open and shift like killer kaleidoscopes as they ready their weapons swarming around the nebuchadnezzar
the hovercraft booms as machines drop onto it
im going to make the call
agent snith is in the elevator when he hears the distant ring of a phone
the agents chase him firing bullets sparking and ricocheting even as neo jumps for the third floor platform
neo kicks in the window jumping into the hall
the doors count backwards
morpheus grabs the biggest gun he can find
the lasers begin to slice through the hull
where is he
hes going to make it
neo can hear the phone ringing
agent brown reaches the broken window behind him just as neo grabs the handle of throwing open the door to find agent sniith waiting
neo cant move cant think neos body jerks and everyone hears it as the life monitors snap flat line
morpheus is frozen in disbelief
three holes in his chest neo falls to the blue shag carpeting blood smearing down the wallpaper
agent smith stands over him still aiming taking no chances
through the lasered opening morpheus screams blasting away at the machines comet wads of plasma burning holes in their armored housings
trinity collapses onto neos body
no no no
neo youre not dead
you cant be dead
kneeling beside him agent brown checks his vital signs
agent smith smiles standing over him
i told you you couldnt win
tank is hit a laser bolt knocking him to the ground
they cant hold them off any longer
morpheus lunges for the self destruct as trinity whispers in neos ear
youre right here
im holding you neo
im not letting you go
do you hear me
i wont let you go
the agents walk to the elevator leaving neos body behind
morpheus flicks the plexiglas shield of the self destruct
dont give it up
she pounds on his chest
the blow echoes deep in his mind
his eyes snap open
trinity screams as the monitors jump back to life
tank and morpheus stare unbelieving
it is a miracle
now get up
neo struggles holding his chest sitting up
down the hall he sees the elevator closing and agent smith staring at him as if he were looking at a cypher
neo gives him the finger
agent smith pounds on the elevator door
a sentinel blows a hole in morpheus right arm and he screams refusing to let go of the detonator
neo dives for the ringing phone
machines split open the craft pouring in lasers targeting everywhere
a beat finds the center of morpheus forehead and he screams ready to die
he turns the key
a blinding shock of white lights flood the chamber sentinels blink and fall instantly dead filling the pit with their cold metal carcasses
in the still darkness only the humans are alive
his eyes open
tears pour from her smiling eyes as he reaches up to touch her
and she kisses hin it seems like it might last forever
as in the opening
the cursor beating steadily waiting
a phone begins to ring
it is answered and the screen fills instantly with the trace program
after a long beat we recognize neos voice
i know youre out there
i know youre working as fast as you can to catch me
we close in on the racing columns of numbers shimmering across the screen
i thought i should call and let you know how things stand
we dive through the numbers surging up through the darkness sucked towards a tight constellation of stars
i know youre real proud of this world youve built the way it works all the nice little rules and such but ive got some bad news
we realize that the constellation is actually the holes in the mouthpiece of a phone
seen from inside
ive decided to make a few changes
we shoot through the holes as neo hangs up the phone
he steps out of the phone booth and starts walking wearing a long black coat and dark glasses
he passes a mother dragging her little boy who cranes his neck as neo takes off flying up into the air
that man flies
dont be silly honey
men dont fly
there is a rush of air as the boy stares up as neo shoots overhead
his coat billowing like a black leather cape as he soars up up and away
