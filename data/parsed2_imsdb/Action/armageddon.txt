a in on what weve found
theo we dont even know what we have yet
comet asteroid it could be anything up there
and dont be so eager to red flag n
they dont call us when they discover anything
jimbo yeah but this is their sandbox were playing in
theo this is our discovery
were going to hold a press conference
were going to be famous
spacewatchll name this thing after us
job offers are going to fly in from all the big companies
that think tank up at m
hell even n
ll be chasing us
pearl im going on oprah larry king letterman
jimbo hell with them im going on howard stern
pearl concentrating this things really acting up tonight
we should find out if anyone else knows about this
jimbo master of factly call n
a theo and say what
hi were a couple astronomer geeks who found something really bitchin floatin in space
you cant just call n
its like calling the white house
besides youll never get the number
jimbo i have the number
i got it from mega monster
jimbo hes some super hacker i went to high school with
guys totally wired into every encrypted government installation
theo hes also an ex con
jimbo they never proved he shut down the power in those seven states
theo grabs the phone
golden and his crew devastated and exhausted search for answers
we cut around the room
clark what the hell was that
technician space junk
technician too big too much
it took out the whole shuttle
clark the press is going to want answers
what are we going to say
not until we know what happened
techs flip and skip looking very haggard furiously typing numbers into the circulator

jimbo whispers to pearl theo i got mission control
flip yeah mission control
jimbo into phone uhh hi im an astronomer in kentucky and i was wondering if you guys had seen some strange activity in the southern middle quadrant of the asteroid
belt between antares major and epsilom scorpio
flip who is this
jimbo my name
flip this is a restricted line
how did you get it
where are you

we dont have enough telescopes to track the skies
temple is it over
golden i dont know
well figure it out

i was calling which is outside spokane washington where my aunt zelda
astronomer tell us the exact ascension angle of your telescope when this was taken
theo its our discovery
astronomer your discovery killed close to people in new york alone people who couldve used a warning

a group of ten n
senior technicians are all talking at once
golden okay guys one of the worst days in n
a history just got worse
ten million to one
a rogue comet came from deep space and collided with an asteroid
some kids actually got a picture of the collision event and told no one
the stuff that hit this morning was the collisions forward thrown matter mere pebbles from whats about to come
clark a big asteroid
a lot bigger than the five mile one that obliterated the dinosaurs
everybody stares at each other
the phone chirps

golden hits a button
a large t
screen establishes audio visual link
temple sits with the joint chiefs white house chief of staff the directors of the n
temple dan were all here
tell us what were up against
golden in its simplest terms
the end of mankind
one asteroid one mile wide or bigger impacts the earth with the equivalent force of all the nuclear weapons in the world times a thousand
half our population will die within hours from tidal waves and heat pulses
the other half wont be so lucky
in the end it will be men eating the flesh of other men
beat its not the end of the world general the world earth will still be here
but there will be no life maybe cockroaches and some resilient strands of bacteria
temple well thats really positive dan
the president just got off the phone with the russians
theyre just about to launch a new mars probe on the biggest rocket in the world
golden and the n
brass exchange sceptical looks
golden with the worst guidance system in the world
their mars probe in was found by a pygmy tribe in africa
temple theyre going to pull off the probe and replace it with four atlas class iv nuclear warheads
enough punch in their opinion not to break it up but to slow it down enough to miss earths orbit
golden their launch date is set for next month
temple theyre going to move it up
golden to when
temple sixteen hours from now
all the n
technicians clamor at once
golden what are they gonna do glue spit and scotch tape it together
even if they get a nuke out to the asteroid a surface nuclear detonation is not going to work
the only way is to split the thing in half and hope the two pieces slide past us
temple thank you for bringing up the impossible dan
colinswood people the presidents joining us mr
president well this has been a tough day
the medias all over this
theyre going to get nothing
telling the public we might all be dead in eighteen days achieves nothing but panic
golden mr president finding this speck in the sky is a very hard thing to do unless you have the exact co ordinates
there are only twelve telescopes powerful enough to see it right now
youve got a full moon goin for four days makes it all but impossible to see
once these things draw closer to earth youll never keep a lid on this
the video screen blinks off
golden looks at his techs
golden how many of you are as scared as i am
golden raises his hand
all the other n
techs one by one raise their hands
golden one giant leap for mankind
everyone remember that
this is what we are going to do
were going to fly to that asteroid with a nuclear device implant it and get off before it blows
all eyes turn to n
chief of r d ronald quincy
quincy has coke bottle glasses and a i
quincy look set a fire cracker off in your open palm you get a third degree burn
close your fist itll do some serious damage
if we can get a nuke deep in one of the asteroids fault lines shell split in two like a diamond
golden youre all looking art us like were crazy
skip dan our currant shuttle fleet is too old and too slow
golden what im going to tell you is a breach of national security and could land me in jail but in eighteen days there arnt gonna be any jails so
were not gonna use a current shuttle
gentlemen im talking about the x
skip its done
quincy has been for three months

the hanger door is open breeze blows back a black silk tarpaulin revealing the x s nose
technicians come and go
golden time is our enemy
this is like the race to the moon guys what this agency was founded on
skip boss were good at space travel but youre talkin about drilling a hole
golden quincys been working on excavating the ice from the moon hes gonna reorient his thinking
and the first thing im gonna do is talk to the guy i ripped off
his name is harry s
hes the best oil driller in the world
golden i dont care who he is what hes doing

what did our always at lunch swedish geologist say
bennie jah jah jah
too much pressure

nods and walks off
harry hits another ball
we reveal his target a greenpeace boat anchored off the rig
the ball strikes the side of the boat just missing the head of one of the protesters

he admires his shot as his daughter grace walks up
grace is late s business dress harvard law
grace having fun
harry hits another ball
it misses the boat skips across the water
grace sure sliced the shit outta that one
frowns harry watch your language gracie
grace seagulls swallow those and they die
harry stupid birds
harrys eyes move to a group of greenpeace protesters across the rig being held back by stamper oil security guards
grace i just talked with a
harry talking to him quite a bit these days
grace awkward pause a rigs acting up
the drill string kicked twice this morning gave chick a nasty bruise in the head
hes not vulnerable there

to himself no thats a cliche
to harry can i start again
i uhh fell
harry you hurt yourself
in love i mean
fallen in love
its the damnedest thing but this person you
across the platform grace escorts five angry oil industry executives over to harry
a klaxon sounds
harry alarmed rushes right past them toward the a derrick
they follow snapping at his heels oil executive you explicitly promised results at thousand feet
harry we have results
oil executive but we dont have oil
weve given you everything youve asked
somebody better tell me why the hell a derrick is not turning
chick hurries up to harry
chick the uhh
the greenpeace guys
harry approaches a derrick
five members of greenpeace have handcuffed themselves in a circle around the drilling pipe
harry hey there what can i do for you
greenpeace leader this is an official protest
harry course it is
i love you guys
you like dolphins and whales i like em too
hey i know you
didnt you have shorter hair
greenpeace leader stamper do you know what this thing does to the eco system
harry howd you get out here
oh that boat down there with a thousand horsepower diesel
greenpeace leader how can you wake up every day and look at yourself in the mirror
harry the same way you did when you blow dried your hair this morning
and you used a curling iron i betcha
did you know most electricitys from burning oil
i stop drillin when the world stops usin it
bennie start er up
greenpeace leader wait
harry cant wait
im a businessman
those goons over there gave me mil
to find oil and they aint leavin till i do
cause they have no lives
the drill string begins to turn in the hole
greenpeace leader we
we threw away the key
time is money
the massive hydraulic kelly begins to descend on the greenpeace activists heads
greenpeace leader stop
the greenpeace leader miraculously produces a key and frantically begins unlocking the handcuffs
grace turns to the oil executives
grace hes good at public relations
approaches grace they watch harry
stares at her what
no response what
no response suddenly across a derrick a klaxon sounds
chick shes kickin
the civilians get the hell away
harry and a
run toward the rig
chick pressures north of seven thousand
we gotta clear the derrick
harry looks at wellhead chick rig up another pipe
chick and bennie look at harry with uncertainty chick and bennie begin clamping and tong a pipe strand onto the drill string like an indy pit stop crew
harry weve hit pressure
we gotta bleed it off
e go any deeper well blow the rig
harry thanks for that opinion
chick full speed
the bits five thousand feet down
full speedll rip the pipe apart
harry you learn all this in college
i been doing this thirty years kid
get on the controls
moves reluctantly to the drilling controls
chick nods to a
who engages the gears
the pipe string turns at full speed
the new drill pipe descends ten feet into the hole then
the torque rips the newly attached pipe from the drilling string
the drill spins freely
hits the stop
lever and stares at harry
the roughnecks converge around the wellhead
im goin down
gimme a wrench and a band coupling
chick hand the items to a
descends into the drilling hole
holding his breath under water shimmies down the drilling pipe feet first inside the water filled concrete tube running from the rig to the ocean floor
begins wrestling the disconnected sections together
the wellhead kicks
the rig platform shakes and shudders
seawater erupts from the wellhead
chick the drill holes flooding
harry strips off his jacket and climbs into the wellhead
he takes a huge breath and disappears into the brine filled drilling hole
is pinned against the hole wall by one of the disconnected pipes
harry comes down the hole
he plants his back against the hole wall and kicks the pipe freeing a
a slow deep rumble emanates from below
the briny water inside the hole suddenly turns black and viscous
and harry exchange an alarmed look
harry then a
pull for the surface up the drilling hole as the wellhead kicks again
the rig platform shudders violently
the derrick sways
seawater spews up from the wellhead
chick get back shes gonna blow
grace chick bennie and the other roughnecks huddle around the flooded drilling hole waiting
tense agonising seconds pass
harry scrambles out covered in
he grabs grace and pulls her away
grace wheres a
harry right behind me
the platform shakes
harry grace and the others sprint away as a geyser of crude oil erupts from the drilling hole blowing a
out of the hole fifteen feet above the wellhead
crashes to the platform floor
crude oil rains down on grace and the roughnecks
they run to grace never do that again
close on a
hes looking back at the drill hole panting traumatised greasy oil raining on his head
you know how i told you there were two obstacles
i didnt do the first cause hes tough
but i did the second
pulls out case opens it i got it at uhm
i cant give it to you until i talk to him but try it on
she reaches for the ring
it slips from a
s hand and falls through the grated floor pinging off the rigs steel pylons feet into the sea below
grace dont worry
tiffanys insures up to a week from purchase
stares despondently over the railing
harry black with crude oil staggers past a
pointedly good plan harry
harry walks over to oil execs theres your oil gentlemen
now get the hell off my rig
golden clark skip flip and the rest of the mission control technicians watch a live feed from russia

they got a nuke up there in sixteen hours
skip itll never fly
clark three things the russians make well guys vodka gymnasts and rockets
dont count em out
golden its the late th century i run the u
space program and im praying to god the russians are better at this than we are
the ground begins to shake uncontrollably
exhaust billows out from the rockets boosters
the russian rocket blasts off and lifts into
the rocket stops accelerating and stands still for a moment
it falls to earth blowing up in a thunderous inferno
golden clark and all the n
techs stare at the burning rocket
golden so wheres our oil driller
a champagne cork pops and widen to harry grace a

theo i dunno but i bet its a whopper
and grace are led into the room by stinson
quincys eyes move to harry quincy hes here
quincy clark and golden stand approach quincy contd dan golden meet mister harry stamper the finest oil driller in the world
golden mister stamper
shaking hands dan golden im director of harry i know who you are
i watched t
first manned lunar orbit
golden that was a long time ago
i run this place now
and weve got a serious problem on our hands that quincy here thinks you might be able to help us out with quincy eagerly outstretches his hand
quincy doesnt let go
quincy im a big fan mr
harry i kinda caught that
to golden whats the problem gentlemen

grace stamper and albert jack frost
stupid name so we call him a
handshakes they run my company
you talk to me you talk to them
golden direct everyone into golden temple clark harry grace and a
sit in a dark room viewing a videotape
quincy stands beside the projector supplying narration
on the tape we see harry on a rig platform shaking hands with an arab businessman harry great home movies
grace and a
quincy nineteen eighty five
the first well drilled over thousand feet
they said it couldnt be done
you did it
on the screen harrys on another rig shaking hands with an indonesian businessman
harry leans over and kisses the bit
the businessmen shake their heads awed
quincy contd nineteen ninety one
directional drilling through two miles of anthracite
they also said that couldnt be done
you did it
harry looks at quincy strangely this sure is a bizarre form of celebrity
quincy contd ninteen ninety three
the first hole over seventy thousand
once again they said golden move it along quincy
quincy right sorry
mister stamper youre the worlds foremost expert in deep drilling
you hold specialized patents in high speed bits drilling fluids downhole motors can i call you harry
harry stick with stamper
golden well mister stamper we need you to drill a hole
its in a difficult place
harry ive drilled in them all
this is really out there
beat space mister stamper
harry as in
satellite photos of the asteroid come up on the screen temple youve watched the news the last hours
you heard about the meteor shower
harry nods what you dont know is that an asteroid is on a collision course with earth
if it hits us earth as we know it will be over
golden were manning a mission to that asteroid to plant a nuclear device in its core
to do that we need to drill an eight hundred foot hole
harry looks at a
is this guy shitting me
i dont think they shit people at n
harry harry an eight hundred foot hole
on a moving asteroid
golden all we want is your advice in perfecting our drilling arm any help you can provide
well pay your usual consultancy of course
harry show me your rig
quincy leads golden harry a
grace and clark through n
s research and development area
this place looks like qs weapons shop from the james bond movies as funded by every company on the fortune huge clinically clean dominated by massive rocket engines
technicians in white coats and hairnets work on a variety of equipment
technicians hunch over a rover vehice not the golf cart used on the moon
this is low squat sturdy with an enclosed airlocked passenger compartment
quincy the armadillo our fourth generation rover
it carries a six cell solar engine with horses
this was a joint venture with the germans
winks its designed by porsche
quincy motions to two technicians
they roll over a robotic arm on a gurney powered by an electric motor
the robotic arm is connected to an oil drilling bit
harry wheres the kelly
quincy this baby works without one
harry how does it work
harry starts to inspect the bit
quincy it works through a series of complexly designed differential gears
harrys face tightens as he studies the bit further harry this is my patent
quincy drilling power transfer without conventional hydraulics by harry s
you registered it with the u
patent office last year
harry you stole it
quincy we just borrowed it mister stamper
quincy unpockets a remote control panel and presses a button
the drill bit presses down into a block of concrete and begins to rapidly chew through it as harry marvels at the realisation of his design
quincy contd we built this arm to mine ice from the moon greatest discovery in space in thirty years
harry whatd this cost
golden ten million
quincy twenty our million
harry boy im in the wrong line of work
so thats where my taxes go
for thievin incompetent government employed rip off artists
no torque adjustment no pressure release valve
a big hunk of junk
quincy were working on that
harry what happens if you hit gas
you have three seconds
drill faster run like hell or pray
beat times up
the rig just blew
golden gentlemen gentlemen wait a second
the crux of the matter
harry hang on
i betcha everyone in this room has a ph
golden or three
harry i left school after tenth grade
i earned my ph
d every day offshore drilling holes
you cant get it in a book
drilling holes is about instinct about smellin it
drillin holes is an art
you want the crux of the matter
beat you stole my patent and you dont have a goddamn idea how to use it
as for this piece o crap dont insult me
walks around the rig ill rebuild it the right way and drill the hole for you
grace uhm pop could we discuss this
harry just give me a space suit
golden you wont need one
youre not going up
harry you dont have a choice
i think all you ph
ds know that
harry walks off
grace and a
golden calling after harry harry
lets figure this out
harry sits opposite golden and temple
grace and a
stand behind him
harry first of all youre going to buy my patent
temple of course completely in order
what is the price
harry fifty million dollars
temple clears his throat
stamper this mission is to preserve the future of
harry youre right too low
im still pissed
harry looks to grace
harry give that money to my greenpeace buddies
smile told you
harry goes to shake pulls back harry contd and i never want to pay taxes again
temple ill call the i
try to uhm explain the situation
they begin to shake
harry withdraws his hand
harry i have this great log cabin in montana
its kind of a nature
temple you want us to buy that too
i fly fish there
but the fly fishins sucked ever since they put in that goddamn hydro electric dam
i want it gone by the time i get back
temple reluctantly nods
they stand to shake harry pulls away again
harry contd now about my crew

golden with lack of sleep and stress falls back into a chair
he closes his eyes opens them finding harry in the upper mission control deck
they lock eyes for a long moment
the city ablaze in neon
the harbour floating junksmanned by chinese merchants
a loud sonic boom cracks in the sky
theres a bright flash in the sky
night becomes day for two seconds
the world slows down motion creeps
the bright flash catches the face of a little boy reaching out for his fathers hand
the asteroid shrieks down hitting the harbours surface in a red hot flash boiled at thousand degrees
the room is silent
reports are starting to come in about the devastation

harry points from all of your intel the deepest fault line is here
this is my sweet spot
if i can get a clean hole in there shell blow in half
and the two pieces will slide right past us
you cannot shatter it
getting hit with smaller asteroids is as bad as one big one
you have to drill plant the nuke lift off and detonate all before the asteroid reaches this position
demonstrates position you have eight hours
you must detonate by this point or the two halves will hit us
harry nods and walks off
sharp drill an eight hundred foot hole in eight hours
is that possible
harry doesnt like to be questioned harry you just worry about getting me on that rock colonel
let me worry about the drilling
a moment of conflict between them
one of the armadillos complete with drilling arm sits at the bottom of the tank

the gauge starts to rise
brass shifts uneasily in their seats
theyre not accoutomed to seeing their astronauts disobey orders
golden contd a
shut the armadillo down now a
we can push it further
lets see what she can do
suddenly the rpms shoot into the red
a red siren spins in the control room
the armadillo shakes violently
the drilling bit grinds to nothing
the armadillo blows a tranny
harrys eyes close
brass looks to golden
one of them shakes their head
sharp and golden exchange a look
sharp shakes his head
presses a button and the cabin simulating depressurisation in space begins to fill with water
everyone around him just watches as a
climbs out of the tank
after a minute a
looks up sees all the eyes in the room on him
harry is outside smoking a coheba
harry runs his hand over a small metal medal that hangs from his neck
s off the team

harrys hand slides down to the medal hanging from his neck
harry contd when i was about your age i was in galveston texas

my wife ran off with a drill rigger left me with grace
everybody in town thought i was a fool
but i stayed with it
and in the last hour of the last day she popped
she spit out that black gold and i danced in it like a wild indian
reflective i captured the magic holding medal this is the last piece of pipe that struck gold that day
harry takes off the medal
sets it on the table
he grabs a cutting vice and cuts the medal in two perfect halves
he hands one half to a

surgeon like microscopic camera tracks it under the keys reaching a computer switch
lev sharp and chick are walking toward the shuttles
the electricity in the mir flutters
lev looks over his shoulder toward the central hub
a chill runs down his spine
dolly into levs eyes lev whispering leak
lev and sharp run toward the central hub
lev punches a klaxon
lev contd chick takes off running past lev and sharp
sharp to chick e vac
unhook the shuttles
reacts to the klaxon starts to climb up the shaft ladder
struggles under the heavy weight of his cold suit finally reaching circuits pop violently all around a
as the mixture of chemical in the air starts to chew the mirs walls
lev sharp and chick run into the hub as the leak continues growing rapidly worse eating the walls
sharp sees the leak
runs back toward the docking port
lev to sharp seal door
as sharp seals the hatch lev returns to look for a
harry and chick react to the klaxox blares
harry unhook the shuttles
harry and chick run out of the rear module and race through the maze of twisting corridors
runs through another corridor heading for the docking port as the walls around him pop
lev files around the corner almost smashing into a
the smoking circuitry sparks and the rear module explodes in a violent concussion launching a long tongue of flame into harry and chick race for the docking module as behind
them a second module fills with fire and explodes rocking the mir
then a third
fire starts to rip through corridors in the mir
the mir shudders and begins to tilt to one side
everything is sideways
lev is knocked to the ground
a heavy computer board falls separating a

lev turns back and runs from where he just came
looks left then right
he doesnt know how to get to the docking port
he starts running
sharp re joins bennie and truman
they unhook the fuel lines to the shuttles
sharp and chick run aboard shuttle freedom
truman boards independence
is at the corridor fork
right or left
the russian writing above both paths doesnt help
just as hes about to go left lev suddenly appears grabs a
and pushes him into the right lev run yankee
sharp to watts as he sits and buckles up shut the doors and fire her up
watts we still have people out there
sharp its them or all of us
close the doors now
as the doors are closing harry and chick rush into shuttle freedom
harrys fingers grab the doors just in time
the doors retract back
harry did a
chick i didnt see him
truman buckles himself in fires up the independence
freedom is fired up
the mir shudders again
sharp we have to go
and lev are running hard as debris falls behind them and the walls start to tear apart
they turn a corner headed toward the docking port harry is at the door eyes frantically searching for a
sharp we go now
sharp stabs a button on his pilot console
the automated doors begin to slide shut
truman stabs a button on his pilot console
the automated doors begin to slide shut
and lev race into the docking port from a rear corridor
harry sees them
lev dives into independence just as the doors close
dives head long through the shutting independence doors
sharp to watts full thrusters
the two shuttles release away from the mir station on full thruster power just escaping as the mir station explodes in an eternal flash fire blowing out sections of wall
panels and sending a solar panel shooting toward freedom that just misses her
the collapsed mir station drifts off into the oblivion of space
sits panting on the floor of the shuttle next to the docking port door
lev stares down at him
lev i am cosmonaut lev andropov what your name
my name is a

golden and sharp sitting around going over data
new images of the closer meaner asteroid approaching
interior small sleeping area
max hanging upside down in zero gravity
wakes up yawning
he looks to bear
max oh man did i have a dream
bear so did martin luthor king
max no this was a bad dream
we were drilling and the ground ate the bit
then it ate the pipe then the derrick
then it ate us
bear thats a dumb ass dream
max im not coming home
they look at each other
harry bear chick and sharp stand looking out the cockpit rear window toward the brilliant blue earth
bear what are you thinking about chick
chick my kid
bear my mom shed be proud to see me as an astronaut
chick harry what are you thinking
harry looking at earth how beautiful it is
thinkin about all that oil i sucked out and spit into the air
funny how a man can live years and realize he aint been doing the right thing
behind a curtain golden confers with collinswood
collinswood the president is counting on you to put out the fire dan
say whatever you have to
just do it
golden walks from behind the curtain
walks up to the podium ten video cameras swivel into position
for a long moment golden just stands there saying nothing
golden i work for the president of the united states
long pause looks over at collinswood but i think its my duty as a scientist to tell the world what is happening
three days ago a manned space mission was sent to intercept an asteroid which has entered the earths orbit
reporters all chatter this is a difficult mission
in all frankness it is the most difficult mission anyone has ever flown
beat a little over fifty years ago we sent our armed forces half way around the world to save the world from an evil empire that threatened mass extinction
the men and women of this nation united answered the calland preserved our freedom
beat once again we face a threat to our way of life
and once again we look to our military to preserve our future
the men and women selected to lead this mission are americas finest and most decorated career officers in the military
our hopes and prayers are with them
golden walks off
the reporters clamor reporters director golden
backstage golden approaches collinswood
collinswood golden your drillers better not let us down
golden well do your best
the two shuttles approach the moon freedom in the lead independence following
beyond the moon too distant to see clearly the asteroid is on its trajectory toward earth
it is a huge graggy mass surrounded on all sides by a debris cluster of rock and ice the ice glinting on and off in reflected sunlight like millions of
watts unbelieving my goodness look at that thing
sharp we have visual of target houston
velocity thirty three hundred miles an hour
clark sits with techs flip and skip
golden and temple pace behind the console
harry chick bear and max finish buckling into their seat restraints and harnesses
lev bennie jimbo and tito buckle on harnesses
bennie looks at a
the shuttles rapidly close on the moon
the dead luminous sphere looms larger in frame
the lunar surface completely fills the cockpit windshield
weve lost sight of the oncoming asteroid
sharp visual contact with target lost houston
in the rear cabin harry chick bear and max stare in awe at the ever approaching moon
shuttles freedom and independence shoot toward the moon pulled by the lunar gravitational field
through the windshield the lunar surface is only miles down looking close enough to reach down and touch
the two shuttles whip into lunar orbit moving around the moon continuing to accelerate nearing its dark side
clark into headset how we doin freedom over
watts nearing the dark side houston a minute thirty and counting
on the moons opposite side the asteroid roars into frame its trailing fragments motionless in relation to each other travelling as a swarm a cluster of debris
as it nears the moons gravitational field trailing fragments peel away drawn into the moon by its lunar gravity
a relatively debris less corridor begins to form on one side of the asteroid
skip twenty seconds till we lose radio contact director
clark youre on your own willie
youve got to raise your velocity thousand miles an hour or you wont catch the target over
sharp see you on the other side houston
skip entering dark side freedom and counting ten nine eight seven
skip radio contact terminated
the radio crackles with static
on the technicians consoles all of freedoms and independences computerized system monitors pressurization oxygen electrical power fuel capacity etc
golden theyll be pullin nine and half gs for eleven minutes general
temple anyone done that before
that russian monkey in
clark well pick em up again in sixteen minutes danny
golden if theyre still alive
the radio is static
watts rockets ready for burn willie
sharp over shoulder to harry and others time to suck it up people
just pretend youre on the big roller coaster at disneyland
mumbles under breath times a hundred
sharp reaches for the booster rocket switch
he gives watts one last look then throws the switch
freedom and independence fire their boosters
the two shuttles explode forward hurtling around the moons dark side with a degree of increasing velocity never before experienced by man
harry chick bear and max get hit with the first g forces
their torsos press back against their seats
they flex their arms breathing deeply expanding their chest cavities as they were taught in training
harry i hate to fly i hate to fly i hate to fly
lev bennie jimbo and tito get slammed back by the first wave of g forces
watts reads her velocity indicator under g forces so bad she speaks through clenched teeth watts fourteen thousand
twenty thousand miles an hour willie
technicians stare at their consoles
clark theyre hittin the big gs right about
golden come on willie you can do this
excruciating gut wrenching turn your intestines inside out g forces
harry and chicks facial muscles distort hideously their rubbery cheeks and lips flatten out
they continue anti g exercises tensing every muscle trying to keep blood flow evenly distributed
and bennies distorted faces likewise go through the anti g force exercises tensing every muscle
in one awe inspiring shot we see shuttles freedom and independence rocketing around the moon in darkness further and further until finally we see increasingly a staggering mind blowing visual
the asteroids trailing debris appears a huge cloud of tiny ice chunks and pebbles and much larger boulders and icebergs the size of houses the ice glinting with reflected sunlight throwing off a dazzling spectral shower of light in all directions and finally the asteroids huge core it has just cleared the moon and now flies straight for its destination the cool blue planet earth dead ahead across an expanse of space
shuttles freedom and independence slingshot out of the lunar orbit and fall in behind the asteroid settling into the debris continued static on the radio
everyone sits nervously waiting
suddenly the shuttles computerised system monitors begin to click back on
clark freedom come in over
independence come in over
golden grabs the mike
come in over
willie can you hear me
a pin could drop
technicians stare nervously at the central board
then suddenly through static sharp houston you gotta see this to believe it
held breaths are exhaled
golden and n
no one is more relieved than grace
sharp and watts stare through the windshield at the asteroid below them and dead ahead
we get our first and only temporary clear glimpse of the designated landing field a relatively smooth unobstructed plane on the asteroids surface
harry is green looks like hes gonna blow chunks
sharp were awake were not pukin
looks over shoulder at harry well harry is
and we got a clear path to the target
truman copy that freedom
clark gives golden a thumbs up
clark well take you in guys
freedom in the lead and independence following to the rear and side descend through the debris less corridor to the waiting asteroid
suddenly a cloud of ice and pebbles wafts in front of the shuttles
in one terrifying second visibility is cut to twenty feet
then pebbles and small ice chunks strike the windshield chipping and denting it
the impacts are violent the interior is buffeted around
its the space equivalent of bad hailstorm
sharp damn it
clark what is it willie
sharp problem houston
weve got debris all over us
rear of cockpit harry and the others alarmed are buffeted around violently
no visibility here either
ice chunks and pebbles bang against the windshield
truman ive got no visibility
ive lost orientation to the target
suddenly as sudden as it came the debris clears
but a huge ice boulder the size of a three story building twirls into independences path
it hits a boulder which collides with another
truman big guy
truman stabs his directional thruster button
shuttle independence veers to the right
sharp hits his directional thruster and freedom veers to the left
freedom goes left independence right splitting the ice boulder
freedom clears the ice boulder by a foot
independence not so lucky clips the ice boulder ripping her left thruster clean off
with one thruster independence careens out of control twirling and spinning
truman panicked i lost left thruster
i have no control
in the independences cargo bay one of the armadillos rips free from its moorings and plunges through the cargo bay doors
sharp steers freedom past the ice boulder
watts wheres the other ship
suddenly the independence with a ripped open cargo bay door careens directly across freedoms path filling freedoms cockpit window nearly colliding with her
sharp hits his thrusters veering away from the damaged independence
sharp and watts watch independence twirling toward the asteroid
the independences errant armadillo strikes the freedoms nose spider webbing the windshield
sharp and watts recoil in terror
the fuselage is spinning
bennie and the others are in terror
in the cockpit truman screams over the radio truman houston mayday mayday were going down
the shuttles roof collides with a rock
we hear scraping metal
the ceiling dents in dislodging interior ceiling panels filled with wires and electrical components they rain down on a
and the others
the sparking cabin fills with smoke
truman crew go to life support
everyone grabs for their helmet frantically trying to get them on
gets his on but he cant lock his neck seal
he fidgets with the little seakl locks
rips off the helmet
it slips from his fingers and floats off through the zero g cabin
throws off his seat harnesses and goes after his helmet
in zero gravity the sides of the twirling cockpit revolve around a
as he moves
we hear a cacophony of voices and banging rocks against independences fuselage
truman mayday houston mayday
golden and the n
personnel can only sit and listen horrified impotent to do anything
at the back of the cabin a
reaches his helmet and frantically gets it back on
the fuselage is still twirling around him
bennie strapped in and freaking out throws off his seat harness and bolts for the safety emergency hatch equipped with explosive truman sees bennie at the emergency hatch
big rocks smash off the windshield in front of truman the windshields safety glass is weakened splintered to the point of bursting
truman get away from that door
bennie is wild eyed crazed
bennie go to hell man i aint dyin on this thing
a rock smashes through the windshield gouging into truman
truman and co pilot weston are sucked out through the windshield
bennie blows the emergency hatchs explosive charges
the hatch door pulls bennie out into space
to his death
flash cuts independences system monitors flash off pressurization goes to zero cabin oxygen goes to zero individual life support monitors go to zero
independences radio transmissions are static and panicked voices
golden runs down the aisle to independences monitors
skip no cabin pressure
systems wide failure
harry and the roughnecks are smashed around in their seats
a boulder the size of a house looms downslope
shuttle freedom is skidding straight for it
sharp and watts watch helplessly as the shuttle skids toward the boulder
freedom hits a smaller rock which changes its skid angle
it clears the boulder by a foot and skids to a stop at the base of the slope
harry and the others jolt to a stop
no one moves
no one breathes
its scary as hell
mission control golden and the other technicians wait breathlessly for some response
golden grabs the mike
no response independence come in
no response come in freedom
skip buries his face in his hands
flip chews his pencil
golden having lost one crew already twists his wedding ring
sharp houston its freedom
we just landed on this son of a bitch over
golden and the technicians breath a sigh of relief
watts whats the status of independence
camera pushes in on harry as he waits for houstons response to this last question
sharp we lost her
camera tight on harry
hes lost men before many men on oil rigs
but not a
chick harry harry jesus christ this cant happen
harry snaps out of it turns to chick
harry it did happen
deal with it
we got a lot of work to do
harry unharnesses himself and rises
golden looks at grace
she looks back
a tear slides off her cheek to the console
harrys daughter doesnt say a word or break down
she just quietly rises and walks to the back of the room
grace rubs her bare ring finger
camera spies the zero barrier clock
seven hours minutes feet drilled
chick bear and max prepare to disembark donning helmet and glove assemblies clicking neck and wrist seals into locking position
harry comes into the cockpit
watts is flipping switches and reading gauges
sharps on the radio
a haze fills the cockpit
watts engine ignition system isnt responding
golden whats the problem
flip engine ignition
sharp houston i dont know where we are
tell me how far we overshot harrys sweep spot
advise on currant location over
skip motions to golden and clark
they hurry over to his console
on skips computer screen is a map of the asteroid containing its geological fault lines
skip they overshot their landing miles
theres a different fault line but its deeper
golden how much deeper
skip two hundred feet
golden exchanges a look with temple
golden harry your fault lines fifty yards off the starboard side
harry stalks to the rear
rockhound yes sir
harry im gonna get you some surface samples and youre gonna tell me what im up against
rockhound rocks are my life
watts willie we might be stuck
sharp exchanges grim looks with pitts and fisk over this bad information
harry the good news just keeps comin
load up guys
sharp watches harry and the guys exit to the rear
freedoms cargo door opens its ramp unfolds to the asteroids surface
harry looks out
freedom is in a small cold dark valley
the asteroids face is tilted away from the earth and sun
the moon is huge on our rear horizon
the place is eerily calm and tranquil
harry walks down the ramp onto the asteroid surface
chick at the armadillos controls engages gears
the armadillo rumbles out of the cargo bay carrying bear max rockhound and pitts over the wheel wells
the armadillo drives yards from freedom and parks
the guys hop down turning on their pro gravity thrusters
bear begins off loading foot long drilling pipes
harry takes readings from a seismic instrument
pulls out a soil sampler a small shovel on a telescoping shaft
he digs it in with his boot
it doesnt dig in at all
he walks around stabbing it into the ground
chick exchanges nervous looks with bear and max
whole goddamn place is bedrock
harry examines the ground
he finds a spot he likes digs an x in the soil with his boot
harry contd here
fire up the bad boy bit
chick max and bear go into action
max screws the bad boy bit onto the first drilling pipe
bear hoists the pipe up to the drilling mechanism muscles it onto the drill drive then clamps it on
harry plugs a tee and golf ball into the craggy surface
he waggles his club a iron head screwed onto the soil samplers shaft
pitts whats he doing
chick wildcatters are superstitious colonel
harry does this every time we break ground
the ball rockets off the tee and keeps going
harry hole number
let er rip
chick throws a lever lowering the bad boy bit into the rocky icy surface
down the drill pipe goes unimpeded feet just like that
it suddenly stops
its turning but not drilling
bear and max approach the drill hole
bear what in hells down there
harry chick bring er up
chick throws it in reverse
the drilling arm reverses out of the hole
the bad boy bot comes up chewed to shreds
harry and the guys examine the drill bit
everyone exchanges a worried look
max the dream
its my dream
harry shut up max
looks at bear whats with the look
get that off your face
youve seen bits get eaten before
bear not after ten feet
chick the first ten better be the worst ten
harry go to the terminator
chick grabs harrys mysterious metal case
harry pops open the metal case revealing the terminator a super high tech bit
harry i designed you
i built you
you are the enemy of all subterranean shit
you are the king
harry passes it to bear who screws it onto the drilling pipe rockhound scoops up a collection of downhole rock chips
harry contd hit it chick
the drill pipe turns
sediment comes whooshing out of the hole and the drill pipe descends like a bitch
sharp watts pitts and fisk have a panel removed exposing the guts of freedoms wiring and components
watts and sharp are inside the panel scrunched against the fuselage wall unbolting a large component
watts hands pitts and fisk a smaller watts unbolt the housing
there and there
the rock chips spew into the collector in front of rockhound
harry looks on
harry what do you make of that
rockhound picks up several chips
draws them close to his eyes
rockhound oh my
oh my my my
this isnt rock
its uhh its uhh its
harry iron deposit
rockhound shakes head no
its been melted
ive only seen this once at a volcano in hawaii
looks up at harry youre drilling into a big slab of cast iron mr
harry picks up the radio
harry give me dan golden
goldens handed the phone
golden yeah harry
whats your situation
you put me down on the worst possible place on this asteroid
im drillin into something i shouldnt
the hole just ate one of my diamond tipped bits in thirty minutes
that has never happened to me in twenty years
golden youre forty minutes in
you should be down feet
how far are you
harry not far
beat twenty three feet
close on golden as he looks at temple
temple this is an exercise in futility
golden to harry dont tell me what you cant do tell me what you can
remember that stamper
harry we will
sharp and pitts enter
fisk hands sharp the phone
sharp sharp over
push in on sharp in extreme close up
his jaw tightens
his eyes dart
sharp contd sir the bird cant fly
temple well you need to get it fixed unless you want to die along with that asteroid
a long pause as sharp listens
sharp contd yes sir
temple and i dont want those drillers knowing about this
they have enough to worry about just drilling the damn ole
collinswood colonel sharp this is chief of staff collinswood
have pitts and fisk prepare to detonate that nuke on the surface
too many lives are at stake here
have them standing by
sharp on your order sir
the gnarled wreck of shuttle independence lies below
twisted metal and cabin materials strewn everywhere
camera moves through the wreckage of independence
emergency lights still on battery flicker
the shattered windshield the blown emergency hatch a corpse lies face down helmet half on half off independences huge tubular nuclear something moves on the ceiling
hanging upside down caught in the twisted fuselage skin
cuts himself down
he twirls to the ground
sees legs moving under rubble
throws off the rubble revealing lev dazed but alive
helps him to his feet
lev what happened to the others
and lev move toward the cockpit
grabs the radio freedom come in over
freedom come in over
shaking head its you and me
smashes the radio in frustration
chick and bear screw on a new length of drill pipe
chick engages the gears
the drill pipe descends
the terminator is working
harry approaches from the shuttle
harry how far
chick almost feet and startin to kick ass
the drill pipe stops
harry walks over to the hole
chick contd that did not sound good
harry increase r
chick throws the lever
the drill pipe turns faster but still doesn t descend
harry and the guys crowd around the drilling hole
max freaky man
bear i got one of those big time crappy feelings about this
harry we gotta get more power down to this bit
thinks looks up at chick full throttle
chick you sure
harry yeah im sure
chick i dont think she can take it
harry shes gonna have to
chick the last time we ran her at full throttle we ripped her up
harry i dont have time to argue chick now goddamn it throttle up or ill come up there and do it for you
chick reluctantly throws the lever to full throttle
the turbine engine roars
the drill pipe turns faster in the hole
the turbine engine is shaking the armadillo
the drill pipe is descending again
the clutch rupture spewing the clutch plates and gears into space
chick throws it into reverse
up comes the terminator chewed to shreds
bear and max look at it then each other
very worried now
bear the terminators terminated
chick the clutch is dead
harry were goin to the second rig
harry stalks off toward the shuttle
harry contd we need the second armadillo
sharp well bring it out to you
harry moves to get his pipe tongs
fisk and pitts are next to the uncovered nuclear bomb
harry looks at the bomb
chick bear and max listen to harry over the inter crew link
harry why dont we cut to the chase fellahs
what the fuck is going on with that other nuke
harry stares at the nuclear weapon
sharp stamper if you cant drill the hole were detonating this thing on the surface
chick and the guys eye each other
harry walks off pissed off
golden and clark are hunched over monitors
two military aides carrying a nuclear command link golden alarmed tries to figure out what they have
chick bear and max enter through the airlock
everyone turns and stares at sharp
sharp theres no way in hell youre gonna get that hole dug and you know it
harry well it wasnt my scientists that told me about the fucking fire cracker inside the hand story
are we detonating on the surface or are we gonna drill
bear i didnt come up here to die
chick i say we drill
they say we have until zero barrier
sharp freaked out that hole better be dug in two hours or were detonating
whether youre on this godforsaken rock or not
harry were drilling
harry and his crew file out
golden to temple what is going on up there
temple your drillers arent doing the job dan
golden after minutes
what do you expect
temple golden we are preparing for surface detonation
golden a surface detonation isnt going to do it general
my scientists have already told you that
it must be detonated inside the asteroid
the alternative is that the earth will be bombarded by smaller matter which will be just as catastrophic
temple stares off pensively into the sky
temple we have a lot better chance of surviving the smaller matter
the drillers have two hours to the aides i want you ready on my command
the adjutants prepare the nuclear command link
military adjutant sir we have interface with the weapon
remote detonator standing by
lev is sitting on the ground head in his hands completely demoralised
lev i feel like skywalker luke when he learn darth vader his father
what i should do
get up we got work to do
let me cash in my chips
lev were getting off this rock if i have to drag your ass the whole way
off levs look now get up
walks into the independence cargo bay detached from the nose section
then climbs into independences armadillo
lev is prying open the cargo bay ramp door the hydraulics are shot golden turns to temple
golden the asteroids surface is heating up
temple what does that mean
golden it means they may not be able to work on the surface for much longer
the temperatures will be unbearable
the armadillo engine rumbling is poised to roll independences long tubular nuclear weapon which has been ejected with other debris from the broken fuselage
lev wait a
we drive over nuclear weapon and we finished before we started
so move it
lev jams a pipe between the arming devic and the nuke
as he rolls the nuke over the arming device detaches rips off and clatters to the ground
temple golden tell your drillers the clock is ticking
i have billion people down here relying on them
in the b
hangs a crayon drawing of sunny day by temples daughter
temple contd a lot of people are die
the armadillo blasts through the cargo bay door
and lev roll off away from the independence
cranes his neck looking out through the armadillo
a ridge with thre tall spires is in the distance ringed with light from freedoms flood lights
a half smile from a
sharp comes back from the cockpit carrying the detonator
harrys on the phone to golden
you told me that the only way to deal with this hunk o crud is to get a nuke feet down
you sticking with that
glad we have that understanding
golden if youre gonna pull this off we have to have a little talk about time
zero barriers in two hours
what about temperature
when did temperatures come into the picture
golden harry your suits are good upto degrees celsius
how hot is it going to get
golden we didnt anticipate you being on the asteroid so long
the clock is ticking
harry how hot is it going to get
golden three hundred and fifty degrees
harrys face drops
harry thanks for telling us now golden
i dont think my bits can handle those kind of temperatures
harry clicks off the radio
watts weve still gotta fix this shuttle stamper
harry give me some more good news
youve got two new assistants who can fix your shuttle
bear max hop to it
theres not a machine they cant fix
we can handle the hole from here
the airlock opens
sharp and pitts are led out by harry
harry colonel sharp if were going to blow this hole you gotta help me
i need some more manpower
the second armadillo rumbles out of freedoms cargo bay
chick and the roughnecks work like a nascar pit crew
sharp and pitts lay on their backs holding down a pound axle fighting zero g
suddenly the ground begins to tremble
s armadillo rumbles over a little hill revealing the ridge wth three spires directly in front of them
the sun is moving over the asteroids far horizon causing a sunrise
it is breathtaking spiritual
and frighteningly bright
over the hill
suddenly the ground under the vehicle shakes sharply
stops the armadillo
the ground around the vehicle heaves up and down
the ground splits
one tectonic plate rises feet in the air
the ground breaks like a wave up and down
here too the ground shakes
bear terrified drops a drill pipe
max is shaken to the ground
chick is nearly thrown off the armadillo
chick clear the rig
chick jumps down bouncing
everybody gets the hell away from the drilling hole
the asteroid shakes violently throwing a
and lev around the cab
rocks bank down on the armadillos top and hood
the asteroid surface continues splitting apart across the slopes fall line
the asteroid rumbles a few more seconds then the quake slowly stops
all is stll
contd lets take a look
lev gets out he nervously paces back and forth across the lip of the fissure
lev this bad
repeating mantra darth vader
everyone thinks were dead
so suck it up
because if we dont drill that hole six billion people are going to die
and im not lettin harry stamper get all the freaking credit for saving the world
firm were gona do this then were going home
lev i l o v e this american confidence
like john wayne
sotto this why i suspect you won cold war
hep me get these rocks over there
and lev start dragging rocks to use as a kicker ramp for the jump
lev is oblivious
they pull embedded rock out revealing diamonds
holds up a large chunk
contd this outta cut into a sweet wedding ring
lev holding chunk with this i can rebuild my mir
chick bear and max cautiously approach the drill hole
everything seems okay
chick climbs back up to the drill drive platform
chick back to work
bear grabs the drill pipe and hoists it
back to work
is walking along the gaping jagged fissure feet wide feet deep stretching across the entire slope
lev this bad this very bad very very bad
stick a cork in it lev
im tryin to think
stares at the fissure his eyes roaming from the fissure
to the armadillo
back to the fissure
contd hop on the back
get our weight distributed better
lev uncertain and why to do this
because im askin
and turn your suits thrusters off
trust me okay
gets in the armadillo
lev goes around back climbs on the rear bumper
he clicks off his pressure suits pro gravity thrusters
lev okey doke
the armadillo begins backing down the slope
throws it in neutral
the armadillo stops
hey lev were gonna see what this porche engine can do
he throws it in drive
the armadillo lurches ahead
the armadillos rear tires churn forward slinging rocks and gravel which in zero g shoot off in a stream into space never falling
lev holds on for dear life
s armadillo churns up the slope like a bronco x slinging gravel heading for the jagged fissure
it flies over the fissures edge as a
punches the armadillos pro gravity thruster off the armadillos roof mounted pro gravity thrusters shut down
the armadillo no longer thrusting downwardly flies across the jagged fissure in zero g
the heavy steel vehicle doesnt fall
it ascends and amazingly shoots across the entire foot expanse of jagged fissure
lev looks down
the fissure passes beneath him then solid ground again
theyve cleared the fissure
but theyre not coming down
up is bad
punches the pro gravity thruster start switch
the thruster nozzles sputter but no thrust
the armadillo is feet off the ground and still ascending
into outer space
lev his next stop being planet mars panics
he climbs the roof and peers inside the front windshield pounding on the windshield
up is bad
the armadillo continues lifting into space from which there is no return
toggles the start switch
the swtichs not quite
only the right front and right rear thruster nozzles fire pushing the right side downward rolling the armadillo over on its side
lev on the bumper clings to the rear mounted suspended in zero g on its side and in mid air the armadillo is pushed by thrusters tires first against the
sheer degree cliff face next to the slope
all four armadillo tires slam against the cliff
the armadillo bounces off
lev grabbing the armadillos towing cable flies off the rear
the cable spools out and lev hanging on for all hes worth slams against the cliff face and descends
lying sideways keeps toggling the thruster start switch
the indicator light finally flashes in and a
rams it into drive the armadillo all four thrusters now working drives sideways across the cliff face dragging lev who bounces against the cliff face and gradually falls until hes
bouncing on the asteroid surface
the armadillo finally falls down the cliff face and skids to a stop
shaken takes a deep breath and gets out
walks to the rear
lev splayed out feet from the back of the armadillo covered in asteroid surface dirt and grime looks up at him
lev very bad idea a
harry orders his crew to start the drill up
the men drill a shitload of feet in record time
they finally burst through the rock and hit easy sediment
the asteroid is spinning toward sunlight
here too there is a sunrise
bears face sweats inside the helmet
chicks vision begins to blur
tito takes a seat on a nearby rock exhausted
its getting warm
bear worried we got that sunrise harry
these bits are gonna fry up
suddenly the transmission linkage in the armadillo blows
harry goddamn it
thinks we take the tranny from the other rig
and if you wanna complain about the heat go to some other fucking asteroid
sharp to roughnecks lets move it
lets go guys
chick and bear yank the detached good transmission housing from inside armadillo and carry it across to armadillo
max finishes unbolting the broken transmission housing
he passes it to chick who dumps it on the surface
sharp and truman work with bear and chick who feed in the good transmission housing
max presses the airlock
the doors close and the cabin pressurises
max clicks off his helmet
he begins installing the transmission housing and the linkage
chick and bear atop the drilling platform begin installing the clutch plates and transmission linkage
harry move guys move it
bolting bolting bolting connecting connecting
skip is analysing the asteroids thermal readings
a multi colored thermal image map shows most of the asteroid is green no heat but around the chosen landing site are numerous red spots heat skip look at these
this is before sunlight hits the drill site
shes really heating up
max is bolting
the downhole pressure gauge needle jolts
max doesnt see it
he keeps working
harrys watching the work
out of the corner of his eye
the drilling arm kicks
harry turns to it
his eyes move back to chick and bear then back to the drilling arm
it kicks up again
just a few inches
unbolt the tranny
chick we just put it in
harry do it
chick confused starts unbolting the tranny
suddenly the well kicks hard one foot high
the rig kicks hard three feet bucking chick off
chick scrambles back up to the drill platform
the ground shakes
a terrific trembler rumbles through the valley
harry max and bear cling to the side of the armadillo
chicks nearly thrown off
harry contd harry climbs up to the drill platform
the ground shakes violently throwing harry and chick around the top of the drill platform
harry max you gotta get those bolts undone
max is furiously unbolting the tranny housing
there are two bolts to go
he ratches one off
max im doin it im doin it
max gets to the last bolt
harry go max go max get the last bolt
max gets the last bolt undone
chick and harry pull the unfastened tranny housing out of the armadillo as max stares at the downhole pressure gauges groping through the compartment for his helmet
max pressures through the roof
shit wheres my helmet
suddenly the drilling arm jolts upward lifting the armadillo six feet off the ground
chick shes gonna blow
harry max get the hell out of there
max is thrown against a wall of the rear compartment
the drilling arm kicks again six feet this time tossing the armadillo over on two wheels
max is slammed against the wall again
terrified he grabs for his helmet and locks the neck seals
a deep rumbling emanates from the drilling hole coming seemingly from the asteroids core
harry gets to his feet and slams his fist against the armadillos side
harry clear the rig
max helmet on is frantically scrambling to the airlock but theres no time
max i cant depressurize
with an awesome force the drilling hole blows
the drilling pipe explodes upward lifting the drilling arm and the entire armadillo vehicle with it
the entire rig blows upward into space
max punches the door lock without depressurising the cabin and is sucked violently out of the rear compartment into open space
fifty feet of drill pipe the drilling arm and the entire armadillo rig with max trailing blows into space
maxs face is a screaming mask of terror and confusion reaching out but theres no one to catch him
harry and the guys watch in helpless silence as the drill rig and max ascend into space
skip motions to golden
he comes over
skip they just lost the rig
the hole blew out
golden takes the news stoically
he thinks looking across the room at temple
he looks at the clock
one hour and forty golden say nothing
a stark tableau
harry and the men standing there just watching
devastated confused in shock
this is a total catastrophe
the mission is over
sharp nods to pitts
pitts picks up the remote nuclear detonator
sharp stamper you ready to blow this
lets get outta here
harry ignores him
he wont accept defeat
harry chick get your butt over here
chick drags his ass over to harry
harry were gonna fix this make it work
if we weld those two together and go in one speed
harry get your ass up here
chick doesnt move
the two men stare at each other
chick ive been with you fourteen years
ive never said this to you never thought i would
chick walks off toward the shuttle
bear joins him
harry atop of the armadillo looks around
his head drops
hes burning up
his fist clenches the half medallion in his hand where is it clipped to suit in pouch of suit
his eyes shut tightly
he is going to will victory from defeat
he will not give up
cameras at low angle giving harry a larger than life look
harry hears something
a low rumble
it is confusing
it sounds like
an armadillo engine
harry opens his eyes
he slowly turns and looks across the valley on the distant ridge the front bumper of a
s armadillo inches over the ridge crest
harry for the first time on the asteroid smiles
miracles do happen
chick and bear about ready to enter the freedoms airlock stop and turn
they see a
s armadillo roaring down the hillside onto the drilling site
and lev roar up to the drilling site in the independences armadillo
they come down a hill spectacularly without brakes and it piles into shit knocking things down
lev and a
bounce up to chick and bear
hugs and high fives go around
back from the dead
chick now you can die with us
harry all the bits are gone a
ive been inventing drill bits for twenty five years and i dont know what to use
you wouldnt happen to need a diamond tipper would you
pulls out the pouch of diamonds found on the ridge
harry boys were back in business
golden stares at the wall
grace is curled up on a chair in the corner
harry we have good news folks
and the russian just showed up
no other survivors
grace shuts her eyes smiling
chick shuts off an arc welder and moves aside letting harry view a drill bit with a
s diamonds mounted on the top like diamonds in a ring setting
harry and the guys smile
the newly created drill bit lowers into the drilling hole and begins turning
it chews into the shit down below whirring and ripping and
chick it worked
shes goin through her like a hot knife through butter
the men drill a shitload of feet in very little time
it is a feverish pace their teamwork perfectly timed as if choreographed
working the levers on the drill platform
hydraulic tongs clamping unclamping on pipe
bear hoisting pipe
chick and bear waiting with connecting pipe
the drilling arm going up and down
newly connected drill pipes descending into the hole
harry watching shouting orders
there are serious wind storms giving harry a
and the other guys problems
so severe they knock guys across the asteroid
skip looks at thermal readings with alarm
skip dan the surface is heating up
harry time a
harry distance chick
chick eight hundred and twenty feet harry
harry we gotta do in thirty minutes
chick downhole pressures goin through the roof
chick throws the lever
the drill pipe stops turning
harry we cant stop
harry got to kid
drill right through the pressure to pay dirt
harry thats crazy
sometimes crazy works
harry and a
stare at each other
harry chick a
s callin this one
chick throws the lever
the drill pipe descends on full throttle
all the technicians stand staring at the central board where a graph shows the drilling progress
flip nine hundred and eighty
theyre into the fault theyre doing it
golden looks at the clock
thirty one minutes to go
he twists his wedding ring
golden now just get the thing in the hole
all the technicians stare at their monitors
the atmosphere is thick with tension
clark chews his nails
the holes finished the drill pipes been pulled a
drives the armadillo safely away from the site
watts and sharp roll a gurney containing the nuclear device a massive stainless steel tube down freedoms cargo bay ramp toward the hole
harry and all the roughnecks stand by the hole
harry one thousand feet
chick smiles thousand and three harry
with a half hour to spare
sharp and watts roll the nuclear device gurney past the roughnecks up to the drilling hole
harry get the pipe and bit outta there
chick gets inside the armadillo
grabs the stick shift
compresses the clutch and throws it in reverse
the drill pipe begins to reverse out of the hole
skip shes gettin hotter
gotta mean gas methane helium probably water vapor
the drill pipe turns sloely retracting from the hole
bear atop the drilling platform is working on something with a wrench
bear accidently drops his wrench
it falls on the turbines ripped mesh protective screen and hangs there
bear looks at it nervously and reaches
the wrench falls into the turbine spinning at six thousand r
with a grinding squeal the wrench shrapnel blows out of the turbine and the drilling arm reverses speeds and violently thrusts the pipe forward buckling it
a piece of the drill string is blown out smashing into sharps helmet spider webbing his faceshield
hes out cold
harry and the guys dive away from the hole
chick confused works the clutch furiously to no avail
the drilling arm rams the pipe back down the hole where it buckles bends and breaks tito tends to sharp
his face has lost all color
harry approaches the hole
fifty feet down is a mess of mangled pipe blocking the hole
golden continues looking at the thermal imaging
golden harry cmon we got thirty minutes
harry well dan youre just going to have to goddamn wait cause turns to guys somebodys gotta go down there
chick dont look at me
bear i cant even get my foot in there
harry turns and eyes a
stares down the hole
harry do or die kid
close on a
as he peers into the hole
something ive been meaning to talk to you about
when this is all over and were back home id like to marry your daughter
harry stares at a
the look priceless
contd maybe ill ask her again later
harry turns around
looking up at the star filled sky
walks over to sharp
whos coming to now
harry to golden oh yeah golden
golden go ahead harry
harry your shuttle pilot just took a nasty shot from a drill string
golden is he alright
harry i hope so hes gotta get us off this shithole
j tied to a safety tether comes down the hole with a hand held cutter and a length of rope
he reaches the obstruction
the drill pipe has been mashed bent buckled
severed ends stab into the sides of the hole
starts cutting with the hand held cutter
the guys stand there watching
agonising seconds pass
suddenly the ground rumbles
it slowly starts to subside
the hole shakes
we need you
i need everything you got
wrestles with the severed pipes untangling them tying the rope to them
he gives the rope a tug
chick and bear above pull up the broken pipes
sharp enter interface with the weapon
pitts clicks a six digit code into a digital pad on the devices pitts device armed
the nuclear device has a small sled with ratchet wheels to let it slide down the hole slowly
sharp and watts lift one end of the gurney
the nuclear device slides off the gurney toward the the thermal and seismic sensors being transmitted from freedom skip its a mess up there
another temblor hits the worst yet
watts falls losing her grip on the gurney her end collapses
the nuclear device lurches sideways off the gurney and rolls away from the drilling hole
the nuclear device slides off the gurney
experiences the deepest most sinister rumble yet emanating form the asteroids core something from hell
theres a horrendous whooshing sound
a windstorm of pebble like a blowing tornado whooshes up from the hole smashing into a
everyone whirls around in the sounds direction as across the valley floor a foot methane geyser erupts spewing a plume of hideous greenish gas into space
then another feet high
another feet high
the asteroid has become alive
the geysers eruptions loosen the asteroids surface material and a
is whooshed violently out of the hole
pebbles and hot steam blasts from the drilling hole
harry get back
shoots out of the pipe tethering the safety line behind him blowing into space
the safety tether snaps and rips off
is feet off the surface
harry dives for his ripped tether
catching it inches before a
s thrown into space
harry and bear grab a
s safety tether and begin to pull him down
chick stares at something o
his jaw drops
chick this thing definitely doesnt like us
chunks of the asteroid some as big as trucks others as big as houses dislodge from the asteroid surface and slowly at first but with terrifyingly increasing speed and momentum
they start rolling
harry and the guys just stand there disbelieving what theyre seeing
on come the rocks and ice chunks rolling
as they hit smaller surface rocks they take little hops and bigger hops until they are bounding across the surface
harry lashes a
s tether to the armadillo
harry and the guys run for their lives
in the midst of this a foot high geyser erupts next to the drilling hole
pitts gets blasted by the geyser which blows him across the asteroid floor slamming him into the parked armadillo
a boulder rolls at pitts and squashes him against the armadillo killing him
a foot ice boulder rolls toward a
s safety tether
suspended feet off the asteroid surface looks down at the oncoming ice boulder
terrified tries to unbuckle the tether but he cant in time
the boulder hits a
s tether rolling over it flattening it to the asteroid surface which causes a
with a jolt to be yanked toward the surface
scrambles with his safety harness
chick next to the armadillo sees a
he dives inside engages the gears
the armadillo roars toward the oncoming ice boulder
terrified continues to descend as chick driving the armadillo rams the ice boulder just as its about to roll over a
the boulder hops up smashes down on the armadillos hood crushing the steel compartment around chick and gently rolls over onto a
who log rolls under the armadillo as the ice boulder whomps down and keeps rolling
the nuclear device is rolling across the asteroids surface
pebbles and debris clanging off the devices remote harry bounds toward the armadillo
the largest jagged rock rolls at the vehicle
theres no place to turn
the rocks rolls straight at him
harry falls heavily to the ground
harry gets up and dives down inside a fox hoe sized indentation in the asteroid surface
the boulder rolls right over him
finally the quake stops
the situation stabilises
everyone gets to their feet
harry and a
they look off at the massive boulders rolling away in the distance smashing into other rock formations
harry picks up a diamond
it sparkles in the light
chick grabs one
holds it up marvelling at it
the massive boulders rolling away in the distance smashing into other rock formations
harry picks up a diamond
it sparkles in the light
chick grabs one
holds it up marvelling at it
sharp with bruises on his face looks through his cracked faceshield down at pitts corpse
sharp hes dead
harry put it down chick
chick tosses down the diamond and follows harry
everyone checks themselves
looks at others
theres no talk no time to lose
they reconvene by the nuclear device
the alumniium gurney is smashed mangled
sharp three on that side the rest over here
they hoist the nuclear device and carry it to the drilling hole
they plug one end of the nuke in the drilling hole and lift the other
the nuke begins to insert down the hole
suddenly sharp tries to grab a tubular piece of aluminium from the broken gurney
sharp contd stop
rams it into the wheels of the nukes ratchet wheel delivery sled
the nuke stops inserting into the hole
sharp inspects the sharp contd the remotes shot
looks up itll have to be manually detonated
chick whats that mean
harry means one of us aint leaving
golden addresses the room
golden the situation the hole is drilled but the remote detonator is not functional
one of the crew is going to stay behind and
deep breath manually detonate the device
golden looks over at grace
she is stunned
the news is just sinking in
golden dont stay for this
grace im not leaving
temple in minutes we will be at zero barrier
to grace your father better be a man of his word
pan from harry
everyone is huddled inside the cabin
the smashed remote detonator a foot spool drum of electrical wire and a knife sit on the table
sharp stoically id trade places with any one of you
but we need two people to fly this mother back
so we either all stay or you guys draw
sharp raises a bundle of electrical wires in his hand
the crews going to draw straws
the highest tension yet
no one breathes no one moves
sharp whos first
no response clockwise then
sharp holds the wire strand bundle in front of lev
lev stares at it
he smiles nervously and reaches
the strand is long
chick chick stares at the bundle sweating
he grabs a strand
he stares at the bundle thinking choosing
he grabs and pulls quickly decisively
two strands remain and two men harry and a
stares at the wire strands not a bundle now
shifts in his chair
the matter will be decided on this last pull
looks at harry
they lock eyes
harry your turn
i aint gonna draw against you harry
chick starts to get up i cant watch this
harry stern hard sit down chick
chick sits down
harry looks at a
stares at the two strands
gets used to the idea
he reaches and begins to pull
chooses the other strand
it is short
stares at the short strand of wire in his hand
we see a fear on his face that gets covered by a small smile
well i guess i won
now im the guy who gets to save the earth
takes off the half medallion
harry takes off his half medallion
we said wed join these after we drilled the hole
it just aint gonna be on earth
they slide the two halves together to make a whole
harry and a
exchange a long look
watts flips switches
suddenly the jets ignite
skip turns to golden excitedly
skip they got freedom goin
and harry stand in the airlock helmets on
harry carries the two thousand foot spool drum of wire
the airlock opens
harry and a
descend onto the asteroid
golden looks at the clock running down ten thirty three
ten thirty two
ten thirty one
harry and a
approach the nuclear device
its half in half out of the drilling hole as they left it
harry and a
alligator clamp the end of the wire spool drum onto the nukes a
j you never answered my question
they finish attaching the wire
pulls the piece of tubular aluminium out of the nukes ratchet wheel delivery sled
the nuke descends downhole slowly spooling out wire from the spool drum
about grace harry
laughs nervously i know it aint gonna happen now but
if things were different
what would you say
harry walks back toward freedom
harry i always wanted a son
and if i had
id want him to be like you
harry hands him the pipe section
harry contd youre going to need some magic in the world
you can marry her a
laughs being told at this dire time in his life
he looks at harry with a hint of bittersweet smile
mean could have
go home a
im not going home harry
with one hand harry stabs the airlock door and then with a small pipe clamp rips a
s air tubes off
harry its my hole i drilled it and im staying with it till the end
harry grabs him throws his kicking screaming body into the airlock
harry contd shes always going to be my little girl
the door shuts automatically
harry is now alone
explodes from the airlock into the cabin
goddamn it harry
lunges for the airlock
sharp grabs a
with his good arm helped by bear
holding him back
sobbing furious pounds on the airlock window staring at harry outside
pounding on the door harry turns and walks back to the drilling hole
sharp looks at him
sharp this guy really is a hero
he wants to talk to his daughter
golden looks over at grace
their eyes meet
tech hands grace a mike and exits
she stares at the static on the monitor
harrys face fades in and out
grace knows something is very wrong from her fathers strained tired face
she forces a smile
intercut with harry inside the armadillo grace daddy
sighs this is so hard for me
i dont have
tears start to well up in her eyes
harry contd i just
want you to know how much i love you
grace im so proud of you daddy
grace wipes a tear from her face
harry looking at earth its so beautiful up here
swallows hard i remember something i read once
the world is a fine place
and worth fighting for
looks at earth smiles gracie im just an iron ass warrior doin whats best
pause take care of a
ill look in on you from time to time
harry pulls off the video link
graces monitors go black
grace touches the monitor as harrys face fades away
her knees buckle
she sinks to the floor
harry looks at the detonator in hand
harry you have three minutes and im not waiting
watts and sharp settle into the cockpit and begin flipping switches
harry all business now situates himself next to the nuke
the manual detonator in his hand
harry lets go sharp
get the hell off this rock
i will push this button
sharp hits the thruster switch
the booster rockets sputter and die
he hits it again
watts unbuckles and goes to the engine ignition system
the timer continues counting down to one thirty four
one thirty three
one thirty two
skip the thrusters are down
harry looks irritably at the shuttles sputtering thruster
harry sharp you better get those engines goin
the timer counts
watts is frantically adjusting the fuel modulators valves
sharp watts we gotta get that thing going
watts the interiorr valves stuck
lev crowds in next to her
watts contd to lev lev backs off
keeps looking at the modulator curiously
in the cockpit the timer reads
sharp keeps hitting the thruster switch
technicians stare pessimistically at consoles
golden stamper you gave me your word
you have five seconds
temple sharp i need a solution
back to lev watts and sharp
sharp sir with all due respect if i knew the problem id give a temple well find a solution
harry is looking at the shuttle
close up on finger ready to pull the trigger
harry sharp what the hell are you doing
get the hell out of harrys eyes close as the clock counts
temple stamper detonate
lev to watts watts what
lev give it whack
lev grab a wrench and goes ballistic
smashes it down on the component again and again and again
we hear jet fuel course through the component and sharp hits the ignition switch and the thrusters fire
shuttle freedom lifts off the asteroid on full reverse thruster power like a harrier jet
it ascends backwards falling away from the asteroid away from earth toward the moon
harry is a solitary figure left behind
sharp watts a
lev and bear watch harry becoming smaller and smaller on the asteroid
harry takes his final breaths
harry all right son of a bitch its just you and me
harrys finger compresses on the detonator button
a geyser of steam next to the drilling hole blat up to five feet away
a second geyser directly underneath harry blows
the manual detonator flies from harrys hand as hes knocked backward into the drilling hole
harry falls ass first down the hole his pro gravity thrusters pushing him further and further down
harrys fingers gouge into the walls of the hole
he scissors his legs
his boots scrape the sides
he begins climbing up out of the hole
we see that his air has been punctured
hes losing pressure
he starts to choke
theyve ascended to a safe distance
sharp somethings wrong
hell come through
sharp we should have detonation by now
harry doesnt fail
sharp were going back
sharp every life that you know will die
unless that nuke is detonated
harrys gloved hands grip the sides of the hole
then his helmet appears
he looks across the asteroid surface to the manual detonator lying in the dirt
the nuke has now descended several hundred feet into the hole
we move down the faces of the terrified men looking down on the craggy asteroid
chick unsure that means we might die too
sharp watts prepare for re landing
watts frozen with fear begins hitting switches
harry crawls out of the hole
the nuke is at the bottom of the hole
harry runs gasping for air bounding across the asteroid surface dodging geysers and rolling debris
he dives for the detonator
he stares long and hard
a tear wells in his eye
his finger presses on the detonator
sweat pours over his face
harry i beat you
slow motion close up on harrys finger as it presses the detonator
the nuclear device detonates
a spectacular concussion
the asteroid splits in two halves as planned like a split diamond
the two blown pieces wing off into space on new vector angles which might miss the earth
the detonation rocks the cabin
everyones violently buffeted around
watts houston we have detonation
watts fumbles for the reverse switches as the flames from the explosion grow closer
she hits the directional thrusters jamming it as hard as it will go
the flames bite up at them
the shuttle veers off toward earth
and the others stare out the cockpit window as the nuclear fission explosion flames out the halves of the asteroid wing off
in extreme slow mo we see images around the world
wall street deserted
a crowded bar with people huddled around a t
extremely tight on a tear falling form a womans face
english farmers in a corn field
a father holding his son as they watch the brilliant flaming sky
golden closes his eyes and falls to his seat
arms raise in unison
at the pyramids dappled in firelight hundreds praying
grace is quietly weeping
the asteroids detonation is computer imaged on the central board
we see the asteroids two halves moving in new directions
the technicians stare in wonderment
golden where are they flip
give me some angles give me some directions give me speeds
flip analysing new data the new courses are
theyre gonna miss us
the technicians cheer
grace looks up
wipes her tears
golden approaches her
golden i just want to tell you im proud to know the daughter of the man who just saved the world
shuttle freedom touches down
quarantine vehicles race out to meet it
tehnicians sit at consoles exhausted
there are coke cans coffee mugs cigarettes overflowing ashtrays
jimbo theo and pearl wearing v
visitors buttons stand at the back
jimbo this definitely doesnt look like a glamorous job
chick and bear unbuckle begin to rise from seats
chick im dyin for a budweiser
sharp stay seated
let the medical quarantine trucks set up
bear i aint gettin another enema from nurse ratchet
chick and bear look at each other
what would harry do
bear i think hed go get a beer
the emergency hatch door blows in front of surprised n
chick and bear walk away from the shuttle
all he n
quarantine medics are looking for them
chick what are you lookin at
bear yeah okay youre right were the studs who just blew up the death star
a wave of fans are held back by military police
sharp holding his shoulder in pain is helped across the tarmac by watts
a vet bystander comes up to sharp and drapes an american flag over his shoulders
temple with a huge grin approaches sharp
temple salutes sharp
among the masses chick catches sight of denise
tommy stands next to her waving a small flag proud as can be
grace runs toward a
he sees her and runs to her
they fall into each others arms
grace is crying
looks up at the sky
hes up there grace
and hell never die
will you marry me
i gotcha a new rock
pulls out one of the diamonds from the asteroid surface as big as a doorknob about two thousand karats
it glitters in the sunlight
grace stares at it agog
as we pull back and camera tilts to the skies above
where harry stampers soul remains
