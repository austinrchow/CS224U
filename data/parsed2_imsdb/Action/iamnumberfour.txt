written by alfred gough miles millar the events in this film are real
names and places have been changed to protect the lorien six who remain in hiding
take this as your first warning
other civilizations do exist
some of them seek to destroy you
pinprick the velvet black sky that stretches over a vast sleeping jungle
a fingernail moon silvers the whispering canopy while gentle tendrils of steam rise
camera drifts across the eternity of treetops until it finds its x square with a wraparound porch and simple wooden shutters
the structure is hidden in a clearing thats been crudely hacked out of the sweaty wilderness
two beds draped in mosquito nets sit on opposite sides of the space
a teen boy sleeps in one and a middle aged man lies in the other
their ebony skin glistens in the swampy heat
the numbing throb of insects fills the silence until the teens eyes fly open
fear grips his face as he looks over at the man who is now upright and awake
they hold their breath listening over the drumming chorus
its louder this time
the teen watches as the man pulls a crystal handled dagger from under his pillow and stealthily creeps to the door
the man cautiously leans in and peers through the bamboo slats
what he sees the empty porch
no sign of life
relieved he turns back opens his mouth to speak when his face contorts
he looks down and sees the tip of protruding from his chest
as the sword is viciously protracted through the door the man meets the teens haunted eyes and whispers his last desperate word
the teens naked feet pound the hot wet earth as he sprints through the maze of trees
flecks of moonlight ricochet off the crystal pendant that dangles around his neck
he moves impossibly fast
faster than any human could
echoes as something otherworldly catches his scent and begins thrashing in pursuit
the teens face tightens with dread and the shouts of his pursuers hammer his ears
he doesnt look back willing himself to survive
he races up a verge and fearlessly launches himself off the edge of god shot looking down as the teen leaps across the abyss
he kicks air as he arcs and finally touches down on the opposite lip
chest heaving he sees the hideous silhouette of its called a piken and skitters to a stop on the other side
it utters a chilling banshee wail of frustration
relieved the teen turns to make his escape when wraps around his throat
he is effortlessly hoisted by a towering man with skin as cold and pale as alabaster
he wears the long red coat of a commander
we catch the briefest glimpse of his cruel magenta eyes as they scan the geometric symbol engraved on the teens pendant
silhouetted against the giant jungle moon he triumphantly raises its serrated blade ignites with silver flame as it sweeps towards the teen
the boys death cry echoes as the camera zeroes in on the pendant that glows brilliant bright
it glimmers to life on the ankle of another teen miles away
his names daniel and hes in the middle of a wild jet ski race with two buddies
the trio crisscrosses the turquoise sea while a party rages on the beach
daniel makes a kamikaze move whips his jet ski past his opponents and victoriously pumps his fist
but his moment of triumph is cut short
his face contorts in agony as he feels searing into his skin
as he leans forward to grip his ankle he cartwheels off the jet ski and viciously body slams across the water
looking up as daniel crashes into view
needles of light flicker from the symbol
its cauterizing into his flesh like a brand
daniel stumbles through the surf and collapses onto the sand clutching his ankle
he rolls onto his side as a crowd of partying teens gathers
a blonde girl leans down to help
daniel whats wrong
did you break your ankle
but as she turns him over she sees the light leaking from between his fingers and reels back
oh my god
he stares up into the crowds fearful faces then staggers to his feet and takes off running
the busy road runs parallel to an expanse of ancient pines
through the trees we catch the shutter image of a figure outrunning the hurtling vehicles
trees whip past as daniel sprints down a sandy track
the pendant that knocks against his chest was carved by the same hand as the african teens but the symbol is unique
he peels off to the right and bursts out onto a long drive
sits at the end
its cake frosting pink and is built right on the edge of a coral white beach
the door flies open and daniel stands on the threshold
henri looks up from his bank of laptops that scroll with news feeds
he is decades older than his suntanned face betrays and youd be way off if you guessed his accent was french
number is dead
henris eyes narrow with urgency
he is immediately on his feet he kneels at daniels side and studies the symbol on the teens ankle
it has stopped glowing but is painfully raw
directly below this fresh wound are they are the same size but each symbol is subtly different
time has transformed them into raised snake smooth scars
henris penetrating eyes look up at the shell shocked teen
did anybody else see this
off daniels panicked nod
skitters across the ceiling its glossy black eyes watch as daniel frantically stuffs his clothes into a duffel bag
the walls are bare
no photos no posters no personality
henri enters holding a crate of computer cables
taillights in five minutes
what we cant carry we burn
i know the drill
tight on a box
its exquisitely carved and inlaid with an intricate geometric design
henri carefully hides it under the drivers seat of an old jeep wagoneer
its the kind with wooden trim
he looks at daniel who feeds homework assignments into a roaring fire
time to go
daniel clicks the sim card from his cell phone snaps it in two and drops it into the fire
bitter he takes one last look at the glittering azure sea then climbs into the jeep
as the engine hums to life camera follows it darts up the fender squeezes into the jamb of the trunk and houdinis into the vehicle with a flick of its
the jeep powers across the long elevated bridge
the dying sun tints the clouds and the sky in violent apocalyptic hues
this is the part i hate the most
but its the only thing in my life thats real
the rest is a lie
people think hes my father
his job is to keep me alive
henris eyes scan the rear view on constant vigil
the speedometer never brushes past
daniel has his head against the window brooding listening to an ipod
we are hiding from the mogadorians
a brutal race that wiped out our entire planet lorien
plastic flags whip overhead
daniel leans against a silver suv and watches henri negotiate with the dealer
only nine children escaped the genocide
we were each given a number and sent here to hide
i dont know where the others are
i only know when one of them is murdered
daniel sits on the edge of a bathtub
he gently unwraps the bandage that covers his ankle and fearfully inspects the neat scab that has formed over the wound
i got the first scar when i was eight
i woke up screaming
we lived in vermont
the second was on a tilt a whirl at a fair in michigan
yesterday was the third
his finger traces the lines of the other two scars
the lush tropical landscape has browned into flat dormant farmland
the silver suv charges through the bleak monotony
because of the spell our elders cast the mogs can only kill us in order
thats the reason ive survived this long
but our enemy is relentless
daniel is asleep with his earphones on
henri glances over his mask of certainty momentarily slips
he looks like a soldier heading into a battle he knows cannot be won
now their hunt has turned to me
i am number
a tired neon sign illuminates the big rigs that rumble past headed to destinations unknown
daniel sullenly stares at a stack of untouched pancakes
henri slides into the booth all business
i sent a letter to the school and theres nothing in the papers
i didnt even get a chance to say goodbye
henri keeps going passes an envelope across the table
daniel pulls out his birth certificate reads the name
just when i think you cant get any less original you lower the bar
im not interested in originality
im interested in untraceable
there are john smiths in the united states
note from this point on daniel will be called john
john looks at him then abruptly gets up and storms away
henri drops on the table and calmly heads after him
a row of ancient arcade games blinks
john angrily stabs the buttons of a space invaders machine as henri approaches
they are alone
johns eyes never leave the video screen
its been so long since the last scar
you got lulled into a false sense of security
thats my fault
john struggles to keep his temper in check
i liked florida
i liked having friends
i liked feeling normal
henris face softens with paternal compassion
i wish that you could have a normal life but you cant
only now does john turn and face him
his eyes blaze with frustration
then why fake it
why not just go hole up in the wilderness
thats exactly what number did
john looks at him confused
henri pulls up an article on his iphone and hands it to john
its from an african news site
a man and his son went missing two nights ago
the locals think they were taken by strange beasts
john understands the implication
the mogadorians are natural born hunters
blending in is our best protection
so we just keep moving from town to town
until i say otherwise yes
john waits as a trucker passes through the room
his voice softens but never loses its intensity
i want to be from someplace henri
loriens your home i dont even remember it
johns tone rubs henri the wrong way
like it or not its your home too
you have a responsibility to those who died
henri and john climb in
i want a say in where we live
off henris face you already picked it didnt you
henri revs the engine to life
cheer up youre going to be living in paradise
a frigid sheet of rain pounds the sign thats planted on the side of this narrow stretch of rural blacktop awelcome to paradise ohio
a the silver suv streaks past its wipers working overtime
it kicks up a spray as it speeds down main street
the dinky storefronts are garishly decorated for halloween
the leaves are washed in a thousand shades of gold
the suv barrels along the drive that twists through the woods
henri pulls up in front of a small house
it sits by itself surrounded by trees
water sluices off the weather worn garage in the yard behind it
a woman steps out of a minivan to greet them
she looks even perkier than the realtor in florida
a warm smile graces her round face and shes clutching a fruit basket
for the record she is called annie
whats your name
where are you from john
why did you move to paradise
because youre an asshole
john waits for a reaction but doesnt get one
because my dad needs peace and quiet to research his book
henri nods and smiles wryly
this was a lot easier when you were
the front door swings open and annie proudly escorts henri and john inside
here we are
home sweet home
they scan the faded interior
the place is in desperate need of a makeover
a grandfather clock pensively ticks at the end of the hall
annie remains relentlessly optimistic
annie places the fruit basket on the dining table and begins turning on the lights
thats one word for it
stewing john exits into the hall with his duffel bag
annie reads the strained dynamic
i feel your pain
i have a daughter his age
apparently i ruin her life on a daily basis
john steps back in holding a sun faded poster featuring nfl great bernie kosar
this guy was covering a hole in my wall
annies cheeks blush with annoyance
i told the handyman to patch that before you arrived
im so sorry
henri is all charm gently leads her to the front door
dont you worry about it
she nods grateful
well knock it off the rent
keep the poster bernie kosar brings good luck here in the buckeye state
the rain has stopped
the wind rustles the trees
john lifts out the last box
as he closes the trunk he doesnt notice the hitchhiking gecko hotfoot it out
henri is busy setting up his computer station
john dumps the box on the floor
thats the last of them
im hitting the sack
i need a new photo first
john crosses and stands against the wall
john gives him a withering look
henri flashes off a shot
the camera is cabled to one of the laptops
tight on laptop the image of john pixelates onto a digital grid and a face recognition program begins to map his facial structure
henri turns to another laptop
ive imputed the new search words daniel jones
big pine key
sunset high school
you think of any others
yeah this place sucks
henri swivels to face him
if theres a story or picture of you on the internet this program will find it
our enemy doesnt know who you are i want to keep it that way
john nods knows hes being a jerk
sand dollar beach thats where we were jet skiing
henri types it in when something scratches at the door
their heads instantly turn towards the sound
slow push in on the door as another scratch echoes
henri is on his feet
he flicks off the lights and silently signals john to retreat down the hall
with the cool air of an assassin henri unzips a duffel bag and pulls out a sleek crystal handled dagger
as he steps to the door
john crouches in the dark clutching a baseball bat
suddenly the light in the bedroom buzzes back on
he holds his breath as the door swings open
he looks up and is relieved to see henri
i found our intruder hes a little small for a mogadorian
at that moment slips between henris legs
it cocks its head studies johns face then pads forward and licks his cheek
the dog greedily laps a bowl of milk
hes starving doesnt have any collar or tags
must have been dumped
you know another pair of eyes and ears watching the house wouldnt be a bad thing
henri considers the request nods
john playfully ruffles the dogs head
what are you going to call him
since i need all the luck i can get how about bernie kosar
john enters dressed in black ready for his first day of school
he dumps his backpack on a chair
henri places a plate with an omelette and perfectly browned hash browns in front of him
you outdid yourself
henri lifts a red backpack into view
john stares at it
i already have a backpack
this one has five days of rations spare clothes cash and a handheld gps
keep it with you at all times
henri come on
youre in the crosshairs now
you have to be ready to leave at a moments notice
with or without me
john stares at the backpack takes in this new reality
he pushes the plate away snatches the backpack and heads out the door
henri stares at the omelette tastes a pinch of hash browns then puts the plate on the floor on his way out
it takes bernie
seconds to race over and start to eat
jack o lanterns stare out from the ahalloween block partya banner strung across the red brick facade
henri drives away
john slides the red backpack onto his shoulder when he hears a familiar bark
he turns and is surprised to find the little dog is sitting by the flagpole wagging his white tipped tail
john crosses to him baffled
bernie what the hell
were you hiding in the car
he scoops the dog into his arms
hey i was about to take a picture of the little guy
john turns and finds shes his age and is holding an old mm nikon
there is something about her unforced beauty that is instantly enchanting
john shuffles uncharacteristically nervous
hes not supposed to be here
bernie hops out of his arms and obediently runs towards home
hes really well trained
how long have you had him
john turns away
sorry about your shot
he begins walking towards the entrance
you just moved into the house on old mill road
its john right
john swings back concerned
dont worry im not stalking you
my mom said she rented it to a guy with a son my age
since i know every other face on this quad that had to be you
where are you from
i dont think that qualifies as an actual answer
i need to register
she raises her camera to snap a shot of him
what are you doing
capturing your first day even though youre technically six weeks late
please dont point that at me
afraid the cameras going to steal your soul
she lifts the viewfinder to her eye adjusts focus
annoyed he covers the lens with his hand
whats your problem
i said no
its only for the yearbook
john regains his composure
im not big into having my picture taken
as he heads away sarah watches intrigued
camera tracks to reveal mark jayne monitoring the encounter
hes the star quarterback and his chiselled jaw tenses with jealousy
loaded with textbooks john instinctively bows his head as he passes the black eye of a hall security camera and steps to a locker
he reaches for the combination lock when viciously sideswipes him
the textbooks scatter across the checkerboard linoleum
john sees the culprit is mark jayne who offers him a taunting grin
john fights his urge to react and watches as mark struts over to his posse of jocks
welcome to paradise irony not included
john looks at the teen standing two lockers down
hes got a battered skateboard tucked into his backpack and wears an army surplus jacket
this is sam goode genius by birth slacker by choice
he nods after mark
his names mark jayne
quarterback sheriffs son hes three years into the best four years of his life
john begins retrieving the fallen books
do yourself a favor stay off his radar
didnt know i was on it
you were talking to sarah harte
she was talking to me
mark and sarah have been exclusive since freshmen year
john looks down the hall and sees mark wrap his arm around sarahs shoulder
if theres another guy in her airspace he shoots them down
you got a warning shot
john piles the books into his locker
maybe ill fire back next time
look youre new so let me tell you how things work in this misnamed backwater
football players are gods the rest of us are mere mortals
if you want to survive keep your head down and dont make waves
you sound like my dad
obviously a wise man
im sam by the way
sam extends his hand
john doesnt take it
thanks for the download
as he slams his locker shut
its an impressive structure with wraparound bleachers
the junior gym class jogs around the track
john hangs in the middle of the pack with his hoodie up blending in
they pass the girls who are stretching on the pristine field
sarahs eyes drift towards john
the coach blows a whistle
lets hit the gym
the assembled teens groan and fan off towards the mouth of a tunnel that stares out from the base of the bleachers
john emerges from the tunnel via a door by the stage
some of his classmates are on the court passing and dribbling
okay half court three on three
girls have this basket boys have that one
two simultaneous games are in progress
john sits on the sidelines waiting his turn
he avoids eye contact with sarah who is sitting in the shadow of the basket
however he does notice mark jayne enter and approach her
new kid youre up
show me what youve got
john steps onto the court and waits for the ball to come his way
he steals a glance and sees sarah and mark arguing
a blur of orange
john swings back and catches the ball
just as he shoots hes distracted by sarahs upset voice
goes wild misses the basket but hits the glass backboard with such force that it mark and sarah are inadvertently forced to separate as shards rain down
all eyes turn to john whos annoyed at his momentary lapse
the coach blows his whistle
hit the showers
lebron grab a broom
as the gym empties john looks over and catches sarah watching him
off this silent exchange
is clutched in henris hands
he heads down the hall and stops in front of the grandfather clock
its tarnished pendulum sways
he unlocks the glass panel and slots the box out of sight behind the clocks brass face
satisfied with the hiding place he locks the front and takes the key
when he turns back he finds the dog is studying him with his head cocked
lets keep this our little secret
off bernies inquisitive eyes
john joins the line
he sees sarah sitting by herself inspecting a photographic contact sheet
his view is blocked by sam
john rubs his hands which are oddly sweaty
first day here and youre already destroying school property
so much for not making waves
john moves past him and grabs a tray
hes flushed and his face is now hot and red
it was an accident
i hear the real spectator sport was mark and sarahs blowout
john wipes his brow distracted
dude you okay
at that moment mark jayne and his buddy kevin cut in front of them
annoyed john taps mark on the shoulder
you got a problem
line starts back there
football players get priority
wheres that posted
im surprised your boyfriend didnt tell you
sam puts his hands up and backs away
mark smirks at john
if you dont know your place around here things can get rough
john holds his ground
in that case i guess i better ask you where i should sit
i was thinking about grabbing that chair next to your girlfriend
in a flash of anger mark whips up his tray hammers it into johns chest knocking him to the floor
you want to talk trash
lets see you back it up
john tries to stand but is suddenly overcome with a wave of pain
he looks down at his hands and is alarmed to see blooming from his palms
he quickly balls them into fists extinguishing the light from view
silence has fallen
still clenching his fists john rises and stumbles out into the hall
off sarahs concern as she watches him exit
henri is on a ladder adjusting a hidden surveillance camera above the front door when bernie starts barking
its an anxious urgent bark
henri steps inside and sees the dog is barking at a shaft of white light blooms from within
the shadow of the swaying pendulum cuts across henris face
as he sprints for the door
disoriented john staggers down the hall
sam catches up
dude hold up
john leans against the wall keeping his hands out of sight
you look like crap
ill get the nurse
but as sam runs off john heads in the other direction
henris suv roars into view whipping up a tornado of leaves
strips of negatives hang on drying lines
john bursts in and slams the door
he slips off his backpack opens his hands
tight on his eyes the brilliant light from his palms shrinks his irises to pinpricks
the luminescence is crisp mercury glass bright and grows stronger every second
suddenly the door opens
john spins in shock
a figure strides through the blinding glare gently takes his hands and folds them into fists
john looks at him confusion and fear etched on his face
henri whats happening to me
youre going to be okay
john angrily holds up one of his luminescent hands
on what planet is this okay
i need to get you out of here
john steps out of the darkroom wearing henris heavy coat
his hands are balled and stuffed into the pockets
henri leads him quickly down the hall
john fearfully studies his hands which have returned to normal then looks over at henri who seems oddly calm
okay start talking
what the hells going on
your first legacy is starting to manifest
an extraordinary ability
yours is called lumen
they start a lot sooner on lorien
i was beginning to fear yours would never emerge
you knew this was going to happen
why didnt you say anything
i didnt want to worry you
you were already under enough pressure
john acknowledges the apology but looks at him suspicious
what else have you been hiding from me
the curtains are drawn
bernie kosar dozes on the couch while john and henri sit at the table staring at the box
this couldnt be opened until your first legacy appeared
john nods nervously
henri places the fingertips of his right hand onto five petal shaped discs inlaid onto the lid
john cautiously follows suit and places his fingers on the apetalsa fanned across the opposite side
momentarily glow and a sharp click echoes from within
john and henri pull their hands away and watch as the box miraculously comes to life
fissures of light sweep across the lines of inlaid stone dividing the lid into sections that begin to twist and reform like high tech origami
push in on bernie as he sits up and watches the box unfold
like an intricate jigsaw the sections finally regroup creating a new pattern on the lid
its a familiar geometric symbol
john touches the crystal pendant that hangs from his neck the symbols are an exact match
john nods cautiously lifts the lid revealing a neat assortment of velvet pouches and an array of colored rocks
they range in size and color but all share a serene beauty
what are they
crystals from loriens core
theyll guide us in your training
john tries to reach for one but henri slaps his hand away
place your hand over them
john follows the instruction and is amazed when a walnut sized crystal floats up from the box
it slowly begins to spin and project our solar system
henri points to a planet
its oceans are dark with pollution and its sprawling continents are barren and treeless
thats what lorien looked like thousands of years ago
we had all the problems that earth has today
the planet was dying until our people made a collective decision to change and slowly lorien began to heal itself thats when the legacies started
john watches as the spinning planet transforms before his eyes
its oceans turn a vibrant chroma key blue and the land masses become a lush emerald green
only a select few developed these abilities
they became known as the garde
thats what i am
like your parents and grandparents
john considers this new information
the other children in the ship
henri finishes johns thought
theyre garde as well
once youve mastered your legacies well find them and face the mogadorians together
john looks at henri curious
what legacy do you have
i dont have any and never will
im your cepan a teacher
my job is not just to protect you but to train you
give me your hand
henri takes one of johns hands and pulls a cigarette lighter from his pocket
john flinches unsure
henri flicks a flame to life and sweeps it under johns outstretched palm
you feel that
amazingly the flame harmlessly licks the skin
but when henri moves the lighter further up johns arm ouch
john jerks his hand away
henri kills the flame shrugs
when were done your entire body will be shielded against fire
john rubs his singed wrist
youll get other legacies too
flying would be cool
you dont get to pick them off a menu
as john spins to the door the shimmering galaxy fades and the crystal drops to the floor
mogs dont knock
henri steps to his computer bank and examines a laptop featuring live feeds from a dozen surveillance cameras hes installed around the property
its a girl
john looks over his shoulder and reacts with surprise
john opens the door and finds sarah amped
howd you do it
her accusation startles him
eviscerate the entire senior class
she pulls a strip of overexposed mm film from her coat
i was in the darkroom before lunch and they were hanging on the line smiling and looking forward to the future
when i got back i found rolls of negatives wiped clean
john shrugs innocently
i dont know what youre talking about
so you werent in the darkroom today
heres a tip
if youre going to lie dont leave a big red backpack at the scene of the crime
she swings his backpack into view
john is mortified
he struggles to find a plausible answer and silently tries to quell the feeling welling in his chest
i dont know what happened
maybe its a sign that you should invest in a digital camera
film tells the truth
clearly im not going to get that from you
he watches as she angrily heads down the steps and climbs into her car
john glances at his palms and is surprised to find they are dimly luminescent
sarahs car sweeps out of the drive and powers towards town unaware of the truck parked in the shadows
is behind the wheel and watches as her headlights fade into the night
off his simmering jealousy
bernie kosar waits expectantly as henri pours adoggie chowa into a bowl
john steps in
she was returning my backpack
he dumps it by the door
i think you should stay home from school for a couple of days
just to be safe
john lies on his bed staring at his luminescent palms conflicted by his emotions
moonlight cuts across bernie kosar who is snoring peacefully at the end of the bed
john tosses and turns
he finally sits up unable to sleep
nursing a mug of black coffee henri diligently scans the laptop screens
hes clearly never gone to bed
he looks up as john enters wearing track gear
im going for a run
bernie trots out and wags his tail pleadingly
sorry buddy you couldnt keep up
epic aerial shot looking down at an eagle as it soars above the rich kaleidoscope of trees
it almost seems to be following john who is powering along a narrow track below
john moves at superhuman speed leaving a blurring wake of leaves
his foot splits a log as he bounds over it
john charges towards a secluded stream
its feet wide
he doesnt slow leaps off the bank and effortlessly hopscotches from boulder to boulder to the other side
it offers a high def view of paradise
john reaches the top and is exhilarated by the sense of temporary liberation
he alights in a nearby oak tree
john bends to tighten his laces his eyes fall on the trio of scars branded on his ankle
his happiness dims
he grits his teeth and takes off for home
as he passes the oak the camera tracks to reveal the gecko scampering down the gnarled trunk
sam is at his locker
he glances over at johns hoping hell show
disappointed he joins the crisscrossing throng
john apracticesa turning his lumen legacy aoffa and aona
henri watches as johns palms glow
a john focuses intently causing them to flare with sudden brilliance
momentarily blinded john jerks back and topples off his chair
sarah sits in the stands doing homework watching mark and the football team practice in the cold metallic floodlight
on the field the ball is hiked to mark
he looks for an opening and fires a perfect spiral to the receiver in the end zone
mark thumps chests with kevin and looks up at the stands only to discover that sarah is gone
johns playing asupercatcha with bernie
he watches as the little guy races back from the woods clutching a ball
panting with exertion the dog lays it at johns feet
john smiles swings back his arm and hauls the ball again
angle on ball it arcs up sails right over the garage and drops earthwards in the heart of the woods
unperturbed by the superhuman throw bernie hightails after the ball
henri steps out and watches amused then tosses john a pair of black driving gloves
off johns eye roll
tight on one of the gloves
its now fingerless and on johns hand
he weaves through the preclass crowd and is about to head into the chemistry lab when he sees
disappearing into a room at the end
hes torn then makes a decision and does something he shouldnt he strides down the hall after her
sarah is alone tacking photographs to a large board thats lying flat on the carpet
she hears the door click turns and coolly regards john
i think you have the wrong room
she rises walks past him and begins searching the photos scattered on the layout table in the middle of the space
wanted to apologize
does the apology come with an explanation
he turns to go has his hand on the door when wait
he looks back
her face softens
how about we delete monday and start over
she steps forward and extends her hand
tight on their hands as they shake
she checks out his fingerless gloves amused
she crosses to the board reaches down to lift it when john steps behind her
he effortlessly picks it up and hooks it onto the wall
they stand back
john stares at the collage of high school images that captures a life hell never know
you know all these people
curse of a small town
ive been around them my whole life
pointing to photo kim thomas
she peed in her bed at a sleepover when we were seven
president of the debate club
plays five instruments
doesnt know hes gay yet
shes been here so long she taught my mom and my four brothers
im the baby of the family in case you were wondering
her curious eyes scour his face
so whats your story
not very interesting
determined to keep the mystery alive arent you
his finger arrows in on a photograph of sarah
its a candid and shes taking a shot with her trademark nikon
wannabe vegetarian but i still love burgers
dreams of being a photojournalist
ive never actually admitted that last one to anybody before
your secrets safe with me
she studies him sensing a kindred spirit
you ever feel you dont belong in your own life
every single day
that almost sounded like a straight answer
they look at each other
theres a charged silence
the moment is broken when whats he doing in here
john and sarah spin to find mark
sarah is flustered
i thought you were on two a days
coach wants me to rest my arm before the scouts come
you didnt answer my question
john was helping me move some boards
john turns to sarah
im going to take off
mark doesnt take his eyes off john and blocks his way
seriously sarah whats up with this guy
i dont have time for this mark
but you had time to go to his house the other night
sarah looks at him stunned by the admission
you were following me
just trying to figure out whats going on with you
sarahs shock turns to anger
youve crossed so many lines i cant even speak to you right now
she hustles out of the room
mark glares at john
this isnt over
off john unmoved by the threat
the sky is even pinker than the house
a drawer flies across the frame
the place has been totally trashed
floorboards have been ripped up
nothing has been spared
camera drifts over the debris to
the mattress has been dissected and its guts lie scattered
kneels in front of johns old desk searching the drawers
she wears a biker jacket combat boots and has a striking adont fuck with mea face
frustrated in her search she flings the desk against the wall
it splinters on impact
tight on the stove a hand twists on the burners
raw gas hisses
the teen girl makes one final scan then heads for the door
the teen girl strides down the steps and crosses to a sleek ducatti
she slips on a helmet
push in on her arctic blue eyes as they focus on the house with a strange intensity
the house detonates
the concussive force of the blast rips the structure right off its stilts
tornadoes of flame blast through the windows as the house catapults into the air
orange reflections flicker on the girls visor as she flips it down revs the motorcycle and scream peels down the drive backlit by the glittering inferno
sam catches john at the lockers
nice freakout the other day
wasnt feeling well
they twist their combination locks
sam swings open his door theres a hissing pop and its the kind banks use to foil heists
in a shocking instant sam and the contents of his locker are splattered
it bears a gruesome resemblance to arterial spray
has his door halfway open and ducks back a second before the ink pack planted in his locker erupts
the spray misses his face but violently spits across his chest and arms
laughter echoes behind them
john spins and finds mark and his posse
tight on johns hands as he balls them and an angry glow flickers through his gloves
to john taunting told you it wasnt over
behind them sams laid back persona cracks
he frantically clears his locker looking for something
he finally pulls out a photo which drips with ink reels at the jocks
john looks back at sam
mark seizes his chance and launches a sucker punch at john
but john sees it out of the corner of his eye and in a blur of motion whips up his hand and
john squeezes it vice tight
mark grimaces in agony
his buddies back into the crowd of teens that has gathered
john leans in close
that sensation youre feeling remember it
with a quick push john shoves mark back against the lockers
mark dents a door and slides to the floor his eyes flaring with lacerated pride
the crowd disperses
mark gets to his feet and exits with his friends but shoots john one final wounded glare
red ink stained water hitchcocks down the drain
john wrings out his black t shirt
he sees sams reflection in the mirror
sam puts some clothes on the bench
i raided lost and found
he holds up a puke green sweater decorated with red snowmen
john turns back to the sink
nobody loses anything cool
he sits and begins to change
dude the way you thrashed mark back there
john acknowledges that with a nod
whip dries his shirt
sam plucks up the photo
the ink is now dried and cracked
whos in the picture
sam stares at it nostalgic
my real dad
i took it the summer before he split
he dragged me and my mom all over the yucatan
he was looking for evidence of ancient astronauts
all i got was montezumas revenge
sounds like a fun vacation
he called himself an anthropologist even though he only made it through one semester of college
he rises and tosses the ruined picture into the trash
always thought hed come back one day who was i kidding
the guys a joke
as the bell rings
the football stadium rises like a monolith in the background
john strides towards the tree line headed home
he turns in surprise as sarah approaches
i heard about the lockers
he starts off again
i broke up with mark
he stops slowly turns back
ive been thinking about doing it for a while
today just finally pushed me over the edge
he studies her face
why are you telling me
she bows her head suddenly embarrassed
i dont know
you made the right call
the certainty of his voice soothes her
she looks up and holds his gaze
their attraction is undeniable
halloween block partys tonight
i saw the banners
ill be on main street hiding behind my camera if you want to swing by
he says nothing
i wasnt expecting an actual response
i could text you later
do they have cell phones on planet john
she holds out her phone
john looks at it tentatively then takes it
as he inputs his number he hears the blare of a car horn looks up and sees henri waiting in his suv
john climbs in
wasnt that your friend from the other night
her names sarah
i didnt ask for a ride home
said there was an incident
john stares out the window guilty
a guy was messing with me
i took care of it
youre stronger and faster because of earths gravity you shouldnt use that advantage to settle petty scores
it was no big deal
dont blow it out of proportion
you cant risk everything over wounded pride
i wasnt looking for a fight
it just happened
get off my back
henri pulls a printout from his coat
john unfolds it
angle on printout its from the florida keynoter website and features a photo of the charred stilt house
johns gut churns as he stares at the image
article says it was arson
we were clean
theres no way the mogs can track us here
henri shakes his head shifts into gear and starts off
they can track us anywhere
i think its time you saw what youre really up against
sunlight razors across workbenches cluttered with rusty tools
henri and john stand in the middle of the space
is open on the floor between them
john lifts his hand and holds it over the crystals
its white and as thick as two fingers
it floats in front of johns face
he tentatively reaches out
when he grips it a shock wave of light blasts out totally wiping out the frame and transporting him into explosions rock and the screams of the dying echo
an old man hustles a terrified boy through the murderous bombardment
the air is choked with ash and smoke
the boy is year old john
the man is his grandfather
young john glances up and sees eclipsing loriens two moons
the angular hulls of the craft are scarred from galactic battles new and ancient and unleash an endless crisscrossing frenzy of missiles
in loric with subtitles keep moving
it wouldnt look out of place in ancient rome
young john and his grandfather race up the steps
a statue of loriens most famous warrior pittacus lore towers in the middle of the chamber
his noble face is illuminated in a shaft of flame tainted moonlight
young john and his grandfather scramble across the space and straight into the path of the soldiers pallid faces flash with smiles
swords drawn they move in for the kill when one is skewered in the throat by a crystal handled dagger
spurts from the wound
the soldiers body fractures like glass and disintegrates in a shower of embers as he drops to the floor
the other mogadorian spins and trades sparking sword strokes with its a violent battle of wills which ends when the cloaked figure kicks up the dead soldiers sword and impales
it into the mogadorians chest
the soldier eviscerates in a cloud of hissing cinders
young john watches in awed terror as the cloaked figure steps towards him and pulls back his hood
he looks younger the years of hiding have aged him
johns grandfather lifts a familiar crystal pendant from his neck and places it over young johns head
this is your cepan
go with him
your life is my life now
i will always protect you
he must survive
a blast scorches across the space
henri spots hunkered behind a column his red coat billows behind him like a curse
they are already hunting you
henri plucks a crystal ankle dagger from his boot grabs young john and charges up
as the commander breaks cover henri hurls the dagger
dives out of its path but roars as the blade spark rips across his right cheek like a hot poker
henri yanks young john by the hand
they take off in one direction while johns grandfather heads off in the other
suddenly swoops between them
the howls of its occupants ricochet through the night
the heat from its engines washes the ground warping the destruction like a ghastly mirage as two bay doors open
young john looks back through the heat haze and catches a impressionistic view as leap out
their reptilian bodies ripple with muscle and their oversize heads glint with raptor like jaws
the piken mercilessly rip into johns grandfather
young john races to help but henri wrenches him back
camera pushes in tight on young johns face as he screams
the memory ends and we
tight on john screaming
he drops the crystal and stumbles back
the experience has left him traumatized
henri steps towards him but john is too overwhelmed and runs out
a stone angrily skips across the water
john is about to toss another when bernie kosar trots into view
he ruffles the dogs fur but doesnt turn when henri steps out of the woods and crosses to his side
i saw my grandfather
i saw what you did to the mogadorians you saved my life
a lot of lorics sacrificed their lives so that you could live
john is still trying to process the memory
he said i must survive
the elders had a plan
you werent on that ship by chance
the nine of you were chosen for a reason
even if only two of you live together youll pose a grave threat to our enemy
consumed by bitterness john hurls another stone
you saw what they did to lorien
how can nine or six or two of us take on that army
henri knows he has to pull him out of this mournful funk
i never thought wed get off lorien alive but we did
i didnt know how we could survive on a strange planet but we have
i gave us six months before the mogs found us its been years
dont give up now
henri grips johns shoulders
you have the potential to do great things
even if you dont see it i do
how can you put so much faith in me
because your life is my life
if you quit then everything ive worked for and sacrificed is meaningless
remember nothing is inevitable
the fragile silence is broken when johns cell phone bleats
he scans a text
the block partys tonight
ill say i cant make it
henri sees john is wracked with doubt and confusion
john looks at him surprised by this paternal gesture
youve had enough for one day
a halloween parade drifts past the crowds packing the sidewalks
icicle lights twinkle in the trees
excited kids in costume zigzag past john
its small town americana at its best
et waddles by holding a jedis hand
john turns and is amused to find sam standing among the mannequins in the display window of a sporting goods store
an annoying chime plays as the door opens and john enters
the store is deserted
the stock needs to be updated and the shelves could use a dust
sam approaches wearing an apron
you work here
not by choice
pointing to sign eds my stepdad
hes under the delusion that if people eat enough candy apples and kettle corn theyll suddenly have the urge to buy sporting goods
john plucks a hockey mask from the basket on the counter
i put those on special tonight for any wannabe jason voorhees
sam pulls off his apron revealing a t shirt emblazoned with the words afuture supervillaina
let me lock up
ill hang with you
he steps to the door and twists the closed sign into view
what about your stepdad
he hit the tavern at
hes already hammered by now
ill probably find him passed out on the doorstep
every night is trick a r treat at my house
john and sam wander past the parade floats lined up along the road bordering the woods
stalls sell hot dogs and cotton candy
john subtly scans the crowd
shes over there
john follows sams gaze and finds sarah taking shots of some kids dunking for apples
she pulls the camera from her eye sees john and smiles as he approaches
you made it
re sams shirt like the t shirt sam
guidance counsellor said i need to set goals for myself
figured id aim high
she looks back at john
what do you think of halloween in paradise
john regards a particularly over the top float
they should pull out all the stops next year
well you havent had the full experience until youve been on the haunted hayride
she motions to the picnic area where teens are lining up to get on tractor pulled hay wagons
the wagons lurch through the mouth of a giant cutout devil and into the woods
give me a sec
she steps to the face painting booth
its sponsored by the local realtor who is sarahs mom annie
sarah hands annie her camera
sam whispers to john
before john can respond sarah steps back
you guys ready
three on a wagon might get a little crowded
ill meet you two on the other side
he gives john a not so subtle wink of encouragement
john and sarah join the end of the line and watch sam head away
i havent really talked to him since th grade
mark had a tight circle
if you werent a jock or cheerleader you didnt exist
im glad you broke free
off their growing connection
the path is lined with human heads piked to wooden stakes
screams wails and ghoulish howls boom from hidden speakers
ominous pov watches from the trees as a wagon with john and sarah rattles into view
its driven by the grim reaper
drop from the trees
sarah freaks as the arachnids dangle over their heads on wires
she rubs her hair flustered looks over at john who is coolly amused by the cheap scares
not even a flinch
none of this scares you does it
im trembling on the inside
you can smile
i was starting to have my doubts
she takes his hand
they clatter past a series of grisly a teen jerks and screams in mock agony as he is fried in an antiquated electric chair
a blood splattered doctor cackles as he hacksaws the legs off a cheerleader chained to a gurney
a squad of blood hungry vampiric football players attacks a rival team of werewolves
ghosts float in the branches as the wagon lurches to a stop
hells gate everybody off
the duo reluctantly clambers off the back and watches as the hay wagon circles back the way it came
once we make it through were home free
pendulums in front of them
sarah screams and clenches johns hand harder
a pathway of lights floods on illuminating a skull capped gate
the words ayour numbers up
are scrawled across it in fake blood
john and sarah step through the gate and enter a natural tunnel of dense overhanging branches
a fog machine gently coughs and spiderwebs stretch across the sides
they are about feet into the tunnel when the lights go out
somewhere a chainsaw sputters to life
white strobe lights suddenly flare on and burst through the gates behind them
the teens take off
its like a flickering scene from a demented silent movie
the zombies have almost caught up when the strobe abruptly ends
the sound of the chainsaws fades and john and sarah stop panting and laughing with relief
that was insane
a werewolf howls somewhere in the darkness
something brushes past johns leg
he spins suddenly unsure
what was that
just part of the ride
he turns sees a flash of purple light and hears the rustle of heavy footsteps on all sides
are you sure
as he steps forward cuts through the dark and viciously smacks john on the back
he drops to the ground like a sack
figures emerge from the shadows and he hears a desperate struggle behind him
john tries to stand but a boot cracks him in the ribs
another strikes the side of his face
he is surrounded
his attackers are brutal and unrelenting
over the looping soundtrack of b movie noises sarahs muffled screams dim
sa his voice is cut off as a fist smashes into his jaw and the steel cap of a combat boot slams his groin
john staggers up but is viciously kicked back to the ground
push in on johns face as it hardens with blind rage
in a blur of motion he reaches up grabs two of his attackers by their coats and hammers their skulls together
as they drop john spins to meet his other two foes with the assailants are illuminated in the phosphorescent glare
theyre not mogadorians but rather one is mark jaynes buddy kevin
theyre wearing zombie makeup and military fatigues and have night vision goggles strapped to their faces
john angrily strides forward palm outstretched
night vision pov everything is an overexposed blur until john brutally clotheslines one then pummel rams kevin in the chest sending him flying back feet into a tree
kevin slumps out for the count
john arcs a glowing hand through the darkness
he plucks up the jocks fallen goggles and heads off with terminator like determination
sarah is carried through the woods by two zombie jocks in camouflage fatigues and night vision goggles
let go of me
she futilely tries to wrestle free
sam is waiting by the exit to the hayride when he hears
in the woods help
something about her terrified tone alerts sam
she doesnt answer
he hesitates a moment then charges into the woods
freaky shadows crisscross as john uses his luminescent palms to navigate his way through the labyrinth of trees
sam scrambles blindly through the darkness
sam turns in the direction of johns voice
hes about to head towards it when trudge into view
sam darts behind a tree
suddenly the area is flooded with preternatural white light
he can hear the sounds of a scuffle and one of the jocks flies past and crashes in a heap while the other screams
youre blinding me
sam cautiously sneaks a peek shields his eyes with a hand
what he sees john pins the jock to a tree and holds a luminous palm up to the lenses of the teens goggles
now turn off that damn flashlight
john rips off the jocks goggles then pile slides him feet into a rotten stump and takes off in a blur of speed
camera stays on sam
off his stunned reaction
a rocky promontory overlooks a crescent shaped waterfall which drops into a swimming hole below
the zombie jocks carry sarah into view and dump her in front of mark
shes wild cat angry when she sees him
are you crazy
mark nods the zombie jocks away
its a practical joke
i swear if you hurt him why do you give a shit
get out of my face mark youre pathetic
im the best thing that ever happened to you and im giving you one more chance
appalled by his hubris sarah turns to leave
dont walk away from me
mark grabs her
sarah wrenches free but loses her balance and falls back on the ground
marks rage is transplanted by concern
he steps towards her to help when back off
mark watches john step out
blood trickles from a cut above johns right eye
are you okay
mark looks past him confused
where the hell are kevin and joe
john holds up a clutch of night vision goggles
they got spooked
hey those are police property
john flings them over marks head into the water
im going to kill you
with lightning speed john grabs marks arm spins him pinning him to a tree
blinded by rage john jerks marks arm up behind his back
mark is in real pain
transfixed with anger john keeps twisting
sarah looks at him pleading
thats his throwing arm
but he doesnt stop until she finally steps forward and slaps him across the face
startled john lets go
footballs all hes got
john stumbles back ashamed and heads into the woods
sarah offers mark a look of disgust and follows after john
john charges into view
sarah catches up
im sorry i didnt want you to break his arm
im not mad at you
im mad at myself
she stops faces him
i had no idea mark would pull something like that
he has seriously gone off the deep end
the guys in love with you
wants you back
thats not love
their eyes meet in the moonlight
walk me home
its a picture book perfect neighborhood
most of the houses are festively decorated with front yard graveyards and cobweb festooned trees
john walks with sarah
they come to the prettiest house on the block
this is me
john stares at the dozen jack o lanterns arranged on the porch
they glare back with flickering bucktooth grins
wait until the christmas decorations go up
my mom decks the halls with so many lights you can see our house from space
stray trick or treaters race past
she motions to the cut above his eye concerned
you should see a doctor
wouldnt waste their time
she looks at him curious
youre not going to tell me how you took out those football players are you
he says nothing
i really dont get you
she steps closer
but i feel like i can trust you
the air is charged
sarah swings open the white picket gate
as she turns back john steps forward and kisses her
although taken by surprise sarah quickly succumbs to his passion
however as their kiss intensifies rise and hover in midair
sarah has her back to them but when johns eyes momentarily flicker open he sees the orbs grinning back
startled he pulls away from her
instantly drop and smash onto the porch their candles blowing out on impact
sarah spins and stares at the jack o lanterns pulp oozes through their cracked shells
suspicious she slowly turns looks at john for an explanation
he does his best to cover his stunned reaction
fat drops of rain begin to fall
john puts up his hood
i better go
off sarah watching him melt into the downpour
bernie is asleep on a blanket
john creeps into the darkness soaked to the bone when
i heard on the police scanner that eight boys were beaten up in the woods tonight
henri turns on a light nursing a mug of coffee
john pulls off his hood
henri looks at the cuts and bruises on johns face
they wont talk
that was a stupid thing to do
what were you thinking
they attacked me
if i hadnt defended myself id be in the er right now
would that have been the better choice
youve got to start trusting me
emotionally charged john points his finger at henri accidentally causing the mug to telekinetically coffee and shards splatter across the floor
henri looks at john stunned
john shrugs sheepishly
i was getting to that
i got a new legacy
henri absorbs that revelation
thats a big step
must have been triggered by the fight
john doesnt correct him averts his gaze
i need to teach you how to control these abilities
well start working on that tomorrow
the conversation is suddenly interrupted by the repetitive whine of an alarm
they cross to the bank of computers
henri urgently stabs commands into a keyboard
what is it
henri pulls up a website
we got a hit on one of the search words
its a paranormal blog
athey walk among us
a angle on computer a video buffers into motion
its handheld and jerky
it whip pans over some sand and joins a group of teens huddled over a figure lying in the surf
hes holding his ankle and light seeps between his fingers
johns chest pounds with fear as he realizes
thats sand dollar beach
looks like a cell phone camera
theres enough for the mogs to id your face
can you take it down
henri remains ice calm and starts typing commands
working on it
im sorry henri
this isnt your fault
theres still nothing to trace us here
henri glances up from his screen
this could take all night
get some sleep
john dumps his hoodie on the floor and slumps on his bed
he pulls his phone out of his jeans and sees a new text message from sam
he clicks it open
push in on johns face as he scans the message with alarm
he sits bolt upright gripped with dread
he checks the message again
tight on phone ai saw what u did in the woods
a john hits delete and clenches the phone in his palm
a bad night just got worse
henri is illuminated by the dirty glow on the computers
his fingers work the keys with expert precision
hes so focused on the task that he doesnt notice blur across the frame of one of the surveillance camera screens and disappear into the woods
john cautiously approaches
its a a s ranch style
the garage adjoins the house
the lights are out
rain bullets off the garage door which is partially concertinaed open
john slides into view
it takes a second for his eyes to adjust
a pickup sits under a white tarp
theres no sign of sam until he boo radleys out of the shadows behind him
ive narrowed it down to three possibilities youre a genetic experiment youre a freak of nature or youre an extraterrestrial
i dont know what you think happened tonight
sam steps closer watery reflections ripple down his face
your hands lit up like a firefly on crack you tossed those football players around like crash test dummies and you took off faster than an olympic runner
did i leave anything out
john silently reels
what do you want from me
i just want to know who you are
john looks at sam realizes hes not going to give up
he hesitates then finally surrenders
im a survivor from a planet called lorien
sam absorbs this confession with awe
hes from there too
henris not my dad
hes my guardian
if he found out you knew about us wed be gone by morning
i dont want to leave paradise
i wont tell anyone
john nods grateful
theres something i want to show you
the tarp is whipped off the pickup truck
its an old ford
sam and john stand before it
the cops found it abandoned in the middle of route just south of white sands new mexico
it was my dads
he went missing six years ago
he was on one of his crazy fact finding trips
he believed we werent alone in the universe
sam rubs his hand across the hood wondering
mom figured he was having an affair and took off
all these years i thought she was right
now youre here
that doesnt prove anything
it proves he wasnt crazy
im starting to think that he didnt bail on us
that maybe something else happened out there that he was taken
the moment is broken by the slam of the front door and the sound of angry footsteps
sam instantly tenses
guess the bar closed
where are you
his speech is slurred and aggressive
you think i wouldnt hear you locked up early
john looks at sam shocked and concerned
you going to be okay
if he finds you here itll be worse
sam crosses to the door leading into the main house and heads inside
shouts erupt almost immediately
john flinches wanting to intervene but finally turns hustles under the garage door and slips into the night
henri is hammering at the keyboard of one of his computers
john enters with two mugs of coffee
you look wiped
henri turns and smiles playfully
i wasnt the only who was up last night
john nervously hands henri one of the cups and lies
sarah texted me
i went over to her house
henri buys the explanation and swings back to his computers
ive tried every trick i know but i cant crack that blogs firewall
there must be a way
we need to find where the sites located and take it offline manually
the url source has been run through a labyrinth of servers it could take weeks to track down
i want to help
henri takes a gulp of coffee and stands
tight on a welding torch as its sparked to life
its flame hisses as henri sweeps it towards john who is standing shirtless
bernie watches curious as henri washes the flame harmlessly up johns naked arm and torso
the walls are now adorned with thanksgiving banners
john and sam head past the lockers
mark and the jocks move out of their way acknowledging the new high school dynamic
using his telekinesis john strains to lift a tennis ball
it momentarily rattles then stops
henri is not impressed
bernie darts ahead as john and sarah walk through a crimson cascade of falling leaves
as they kiss the leaves around them freeze midair and slowly begin to drift upwards
john helps sam with a dusty box
its stuffed with sams dads old papers and books
we catch tantalizing glimpses of images stonehenge machu picchu the rings of saturn
its a vandy student hangout
camera drifts over a row of computer terminals and finds the teen girl who torched the stilt house
shes studying her computer screen intently
reverse to reveal she is watching the cell phone footage of john on the athey walk among usa blog
under henris watchful gaze john focuses on a tennis ball
john grins in triumph causing the ball to drop and bounce on the floor
mark silently stews when he sees sarah and john sitting together at a table
bernie pogos on his back legs trying to bite the tennis ball that john telekinetically hovers just out of the dogs reach
close on a laptop scrolling with endless lines of url addresses
reverse to reveal henri studying the screen
john is fully submerged in an old claw foot tub
go to johns distorted view looking up at henri as he drops a match into the tub
the liquid instantly ignites and we realize johns lying in gasoline
he sits up rests his hands behind his head as the flames harmlessly lick his face
the trees are now bare
john stands feet from henri and nods
henri flicks the switch of an automated tennis ball server
johns face is a mask of concentration as the yellow balls fly towards him
he holds up his hand and the balls its like theyve hit an invisible wall two feet from his hand
they hang there
john sees a smile sneak onto henris face and momentarily loses focus causing the wall to collapse and the balls to drop into the mud
bernie looks like a drowned rat
hes sitting in the tub being scrubbed by john and sarah
i dont see any family pictures around
i guess the photo aversion is hereditary
he greets the observation with a shrug
she carries on
is there anyone else in your life
it was a long time ago
its just me and my dad now
john uses a nail brush to clean the beagles ears
i get the feeling he doesnt like me very much
it takes him a while to warm up to people
sarah considers this
why dont you bring your dad and celebrate with us
i dont know
are there going to be a lot of people
a tsunami of relatives
but dont worry ill shield you from the wave
besides i want everyone to meet you
she playfully splashes him
their faces inch closer
they begin making out hot and heavy until henri suddenly walks in
ive found the caught in the act the teens lurch away from each other
just giving bernie a quick bath
youre clearly putting a lot of effort into it
i better hit the road
see you tomorrow
off john as she hustles out
henri sits in front of his computers
john enters with bernie who is wrapped in a beach towel
he begins drying the dog in front of the fire
henri breaks the silence
i finally tracked the location of that blog
its a house in warsaw indiana
about four hours from here
im heading up there tomorrow
sarah invited us to thanksgiving
i told her wed be there
send my regrets
you shouldnt go alone
it could be dangerous
i wont risk taking you
ill leave early and be back by five
john looks up and sees henri sitting in solitude
dont you ever get lonely
surprised by the question henri swivels to face him
how could i
i have you
you know what i mean
all these years theres never been anyone
we arent like humans
once we fall in love its for life
the pain of separation is unbearable
henris face clouds with melancholy and he abruptly gets up
as he heads into the kitchen john studies him with new eyes
steam billows as henri washes up
he keeps his back to john when he enters
john waits then softly asks
what was her name
henri slots a plate onto the draining board
you left her to save me
youre not responsible for what happened to her they are
he slowly turns and regards john with deep paternal concern
i looked at her the way you look at sarah
she cant come with us when we leave and we always have to leave you know that
john nods not wanting to deal with that reality
i was hoping to protect you from that pain
you cant protect me from everything
off henris sad smile of acknowledgement
the halloween decorations have been replaced by a thanksgiving display
wearing khakis and a pale blue oxford john tentatively walks up the front path
the warm sound of laughter drifts from inside
he takes a breath and rings the doorbell
its like a norman rockwell cover come to life
every inch of counter space is filled with platters of food
john watches sarah annie and a boisterous assortment of relatives put the finishing touches to the thanksgiving feast
kids rush in and out in a manic game of tag
john is captivated by the sense of family and celebration things hes never known in his own life
sarah steps over
shes wearing a funky cool vintage dress
come on were on gravy boat duty
the table is decorated with garlands of autumn leaves and an elaborate pine cone centerpiece
sarah places the last turkey shaped gravy boat onto the table
she smiles at john
you look dazed
just taking it all in
im glad you came
they tenderly kiss until annie bustles in carrying a steaming bowl of mashed potatoes
dont mind me
she puts the bowl on the table and grabs sarahs camera
lets get a picture of you two lovebirds
sarah cringes as annie lifts the camera to her eye
john really doesnt like having his its okay
let her take it
the gesture means the world to sarah
he puts his arm around her
sarah nestles her face against his
as the flash wipes red candles flicker
sarahs dad is expertly carving the turkey
everybody is at the table
john sits next to sarah
she holds his hand under the table
its hallmark worthy until the carriage clock on the mantel chimes
john looks at his phone
his brow creases with concern
he turns to sarah whispers
i need to check in with henri
john speed dials as he steps out into the cold
he holds the phone to his ear
it rings three times and then is answered
the call is hung up
suddenly on edge john redials
this time its picked up immediately
are you one of them too
john reacts to the chilling menace of the mans tone
who are you
john jerks the phone from his ear and stares at it panicked
he paces desperate and unsure then gets an idea and punches another number
i need your help
the food is getting cold
everybody is waiting for john
sarah catches her mothers disapproving look
ill see whats taking him so long
sarah steps out just in time to see john climb into a pickup truck
its the one from sams garage
he looks back
i have to go
off her confused disappointment as the truck squeals away
sam is behind the wheel
i owe you
anything to get out of thanksgiving at my house
he offers john a weary smile
i checked out that blog on the way over
saw the video
what was the deal with your ankle
john pulls up his khakis shows sam the trio of scars
they kind of look like the symbols in my dads research
you guys dont abduct people
irritated he covers them back up
how about the ones you said were hunting you
theyre capable of anything
we need to get to warsaw now
suddenly johns cell phone rings
he snatches it up but is disappointed to see the name asaraha flashing on the lcd
he hits ignore and the truck hurtles into the dark
its a dilapidated victorian
mist shrouds the yard which is littered with junked cars and trash
the pickup crawls to a stop in the shadows across the street
the teens sit in silence
henri tracked the url to that house
sam scans the street
i dont see his suv anywhere
he would have parked it across town
sam opens the glove compartment and pulls out a revolver
stole it from ed
john yanks sams arm away from the door handle
i called you because i needed a ride not a sidekick
if i could have run here i would have
ill call you when i get back
off sam as john climbs out alone
its graveyard quiet
john nervously sneaks down the side of the house
his breath fogs as he inch creaks up the wooden
he squats in front of the door
he holds up a luminescent palm and uses it like a flashlight to sweep the interior
what he sees take out boxes litter the filthy counter
the sink is swamped with dirty dishes
the light washes across a semiautomatic sitting by a packet of lucky strikes
annoyed john spins and finds sam creeping towards him
i told you to go
they might know where my dad is
john realizes sam is determined
he sweeps his hand back over the kitchen door
his palm illuminates a familiar its lying on the counter by the fridge
john aturns offa his palm and reaches for the door handle
sam anxiously swats his arm away
other than strength speed and night light what powers have you got
telekinesis but thats a work in progress
no invisibility x ray vision flight
sam we drove here
sam takes a deep breath psyching himself up
lets do it
but as john reaches for the door handle the kitchen light suddenly turns on and a man enters
hes built like a wrestler and goes by the name of frank
with a lucky strike clenched between his lips frank picks up the packet on the table and is pissed to discover its empty
he crushes it in his fist and crosses to the door
john and sam are gone
frank steps out and locks the door
he flicks away his cigarette as he heads down the stairs
camera follows the butt as it cartwheels into hes crouched next to john at the side of the porch
he frantically begins trying to extinguish the stub
john clamps his hand over sams mouth and snuffs the cigarette between his fingers
once franks safely around the corner john releases his hand
the duo silently climbs onto the porch
john squats in front of the door
his hand shakes as he holds it out towards the lock and concentrates
theres a loud click
you just dead bolted it
way to go
new plan follow lucky strike
text me if he comes back
sam sneaks off after frank
tight on lock as the dead bolt turns by itself and the door swings open
john cautiously crosses the threshold
he holds up his right hand dims his palm to a dull blue glow
he retrieves henris dagger and tentatively heads into
everything is filmed with dust
its freezing and johns breath fogs in the hazy aura his palm casts
the naked floorboards creak
fear bites as john scans the lifeless gloom not sure where to start
tight on his shoe as it brushes a mousetrap
his breath catches in his throat
he aturns offa his hand
his heart thumps as he waits for something to react to the noise
but nothing does
as his eyes adjust to the dark he notices a rectangle of light faintly leaking from the door that leads down into
the ancient stairs sag as john slowly descends
the space is illuminated by a single naked bulb
the sound of dripping water hammers the silence
john scans the rabbit warren of rooms and sees a figure chained to a chair in the corner
he races over
but as he reaches for henris gag a young man steps out of the shadows holding a baseball bat
john turns too late and the bat strikes his left side
he drops the dagger as he falls to the floor his ribs searing
the man bret raises the bat again
john focuses his mind
whips out of brets grip and torpedoes towards john who ducks out of the way as the bat flies past
confused bret lurches forward
john scrambles for the bat clenches it in his hand and swings it into the young mans legs
knocks the light as he topples into a column and crashes onto the cement out cold
its over in a violent blur
john sits stunned for a moment
the swinging bulb casts surreal shadows as he spins back to henri telekinetically aunlocksa the padlock securing the chains and rips off the gag
henri is groggy and his face is swollen from brutal beatings
you shouldnt be here
your life is my life remember
henri tries to shake his drug induced haze
i talked my way in
thought the big guy was buying it
he rubs a wound on his neck
i was asking him about the video when the other one shot me from behind
some sort of animal tranq
im getting rusty
suddenly johns phone vibrates
its a message from sam aget out now
a we have to leave
john helps henri up they race for the stairs when brets hand grabs johns ankle tripping him to the floor
henri smashes his boot into brets face knocking him out for good
john staggers up they spin for the stairs just as head down them into view
frank holds the revolver against sams neck
their shadows crisscross under the swaying bulb
stay planted or ill blow your friends head off
henri looks at john in shock
he came to help
john and henri put up their hands
john focuses on the gun but as the light bulb sweeps past he causes it to explode
henri body slams frank sending the revolver skittering
but as he wrenches sam to safety to the pickup fly out of sams pocket and slide under the stairs
john flashes on his palm casting everything in eerie blue light
on all fours frank scrambles for the fallen weapon
its almost within reach when he is lifted right off the ground by an invisible force
sam looks over at john impressed
youre the one from the video
youre the one theyre after
with tremendous telekinetic effort john slams frank against the ceiling
tell me what you know
franks says nothing
john trains his palm light on the big mans face
its like a blinding interrogation lamp
i dont know what theyre called
the one in the red coat said hed kill me if i didnt do what he wanted
this revelation stuns henri
theyve been here
frank nods in terror
he told me to call if anyone came asking about the video
sweat beads johns face from the mental exertion
they wanted me to hold your friend until they got here
henri urgently retrieves sams gun and his dagger
we need to go
john areleasesa frank who drops onto the floor like a whale and is knocked out
at that moment a razor thin line of dust drops from the floorboards above
john immediately extinguishes his palm
the trio stands frozen necks craned up ears pricked as the floorboards creak above them
they are definitely not alone
four mogadorian soldiers stalk through the house
their long black coats silently sweep
one sniffs the air like a bloodhound and motions towards the basement door
the door is shredded off its hinges and flies down the stairs
the mogadorian patrol storms through the cloud of splinters
frank and bret lie where they fell but theres no sign of john henri or sam
pissed one of the mogadorians strides towards a small blacked out window
he punches out the glass with his fist and catches sight of sam clambering over the back fence
john henri and sam pile in
sam get us out of here
sam reaches into his jeans then frantically checks his pockets
i must have dropped the keys
henri keeps his cool looks at john
start the engine
henris calm eyes never leave him
yes you can
john nods puts his hand on the dash and closes his eyes
the engine turns over but doesnt start
sam looks up the street panicked as
climbs out of a black suv and storms towards them
johns brow is furrowed with concentration
the mog unsheathes his sword as he runs
with a superhuman leap he lands on the hood twaaaaack
john and henri spin out of the way as the sword shatters the windshield and impales in the back of the seat missing them by a mouse hair
as the mogadorian withdraws the sword to strike again henri sweeps up his dagger and stakes it into the mogs neck
the engine roars to life
the mogadorian tumbles off the hood magenta light spurting from his wound
john turns to sam who is petrified and screams
sam wrenches the shaft into gear and floors the gas
the mogadorian eviscerates in a frenzy of embers
the truck bursts through the blizzard of sparks and streak peels away
camera tracks the swish of a familiar red coat as its owner slowly descends the stairs pans up past his right hand which methodically twists two meditation balls to reveal
hes the one who slaughtered number in africa
his men part as he steps into view and crosses to frank and bret who are chained to chairs
a soldier stands behind each one
frank looks at the commander in terror
i called you like i said
its not my fault they got away
the commander steps into the moonlight that seeps through the window
we get our first good look at his face
a gnarled scar runs down his right cheek identifying him as the same mogadorian henri wounded in the escape from lorien
his skin is deathly pale and his eyes have a cold purple tint
where did they go
his accent is thick and his voice is unnerving
how should i know
the kid had me pinned to the ceiling
the commander turns to bret
where did they go
bret is too freaked to even speak
the commander nods to the soldiers
they grab frank and bret by the heads and yank open their mouths
frank watches in confused terror as the commander holds one of the meditation balls
suddenly flower open across its surface and viciously spin
with cold blooded calm the commander drops the ball into franks mouth
off its terrible drill like whir
vermillion clouds streak the heavens
sams truck pulls up next to henris suv which is inconspicuously parked in front of a hour pharmacy
john turns to sam
well meet you back at the house
were not going back to paradise
thank you for your help but youll never see us again
henri climbs out
sam looks at john confused
is he serious
john nods numb
what am i supposed to tell people
forget about us
we never existed
off sam as john climbs out
its a rundown dump on the bleak edge of a no name town
john silently stews
bikers smoke at the edge of the grimy pool which is drained for the winter and rattles with frozen leaves
henri steps out of the motel office with a key
henri lets john inside chains the door and draws the sun bleached curtains
we leave at nightfall
henri this is insane
they still dont know where we live
its only a matter of time
they know our faces
they saw sam
how long has he known
henri is floored and hurt by the admission
i trusted you and you lied to me
john bows his head cant meet henris gaze
only because i knew how youd react and i didnt want to leave paradise
henri paces tries to quell his emotions
now we dont have a choice
the mogs are using humans to trap us
from this point on no more towns
no more schools
were going off the grid until we find the others
his tone is defiant
this isnt a discussion
in a flash of pent up anger john holds up his hand and telekinetically sweeps henri off his feet and pins him against the wall
henri looks at him stunned
im not leaving without saying goodbye to sarah
henri fixes him with a steel edged stare
spent john releases henri who slides to the floor shaken
the dynamics of their relationship forever changed
henri finally stands
give me your phone and ids
john hands him his cell phone and wallet
henri opens the back of the phone and pulls out the sim card
john smith dies today
reporters and lookie loos watch from behind the crime scene tape that crisscrosses the street
camera zeroes in on shes the one we saw in nashville and who torched the stilt house
her eyes study the stream of police that hustles in and out of the house carrying evidence baggies and equipment
a crime scene photographer methodically catalogs the grim blood soaked nightmare
hes in a full body suit and booties
the flashgun mounted to his camera whitewashes the space as a uniform cop appears on the stairs
the chief wants to send the morgue boys in and seal this tomb
hope they havent had lunch yet
these guys were gutted from the inside out
he steps over to franks body which has been splayed open
as he flashes off some shots the appears in the corner of his viewfinder
shes kneeling by franks severed head which has rolled a short distance from the body
the photographer pulls the camera away from his eye and looks at the teen girl confused
who the hell are you
she ignores him
he glances at the only window which is feet away on the other side of the room
howd you get in
the girl continues examining franks wounds
totally unnerved the photographer shouts up the stairs
hey weve got a live one down here
when he spins back the girl is gone vanished into thin air
tight on a dirt devil as it snorts up beads of broken glass
reveal sam cleaning the evidence of the previous nights adventure
cardboard covers the missing passenger window
sam climbs out of the truck and is startled by sarah
where is he sam
i dont know
he tries to avoid eye contact but she is determined
what happened last night
ive tried calling him all day
but his numbers no longer in service
forget about him sarah
incredulous she grabs his arm
im not going anywhere until you tell me whats going on
he left with henri and he isnt coming back
off sarah shattered
john stands under the steaming spray
eyes screwed shut
naked and lost
two loud knocks at the door
taillights in five
the group of bikers by the pool has grown four fold
theyre partying hard
henri keeps his head down as he passes
the female clerk stares at the tv mounted on the wall
shes watching a local news report about the warsaw house murders
the window rattles as a motorcycle speeds past and he slides his key onto the counter
henri steps in and is annoyed to hear the shower still running
he strides to the bathroom door
henri shoulder rams the door open
he whips back the shower curtain and stares at the empty tub
off henris grim concern
the sky is twilight blue
a gleaming harley roars around the bend going full throttle
john is on its back
the wind whips his hair
eyes set forward
headed back to paradise
annie opens the front door and is surprised to find john
little late for dessert
i need to talk to sarah
shes not here
some friends dragged her to a party at mark jaynes
john absorbs this news turns
annie steps out after him
i dont usually pry into my daughters love life i certainly didnt want my mother in mine but sarahs my youngest and shes special to me
shes special to me too
the big two story property dominates the end of a cul de sac
teens stream up the drive
cars are parked end to end down the street
camera cranes to meet john as he charges into view on the stolen motorcycle
john works his way through the throng of partying teens
he passes a red haired teen boy recording the event on a flipvideo camera
a hand grips johns shoulder
john turns to find mark jayne
you werent invited
she doesnt want to see you
john shoves him aside and heads for the sweeping stairs
its been transformed into a major makeout den
candles line the windowsills and ring the edge of the pool table
teenage couples grope in the flickering half light
kevins going for the beer bong record
the teens immediately bolt for the stairs
in the giddy exodus one of them accidentally brushes onto the white shag rug
john heads down the burgundy hall which is lined with family portraits
he glances in the rooms as he passes
sarah and her friend emily sit on the bed with marks two dogs abby and dozer
a wedge of light cuts across them as the door opens and john steps in
she leaps up and hugs him
john waits as emily exits
im sorry about last night
she pulls away her relief turning to anger
not good enough
sam said you were never coming back
what are you doing here
i couldnt leave without seeing you one last time
she looks at him crushed
so its true
whats going on
what kind of trouble are you and your dad in
were going to be fine
whatever it is ill understand just tell me the truth
the truth is im not who you think i am
you need to forget about me
why are you acting like this
because its the only way to keep you safe
safe from what
he turns away shields her from his torment
he doesnt look back as he walks out the door
camera stays on sarah as she sinks onto the bed and the dogs comfort her
party goers pack the hall and kitchen watching kevin consume an impossible amount of beer through a funnel and hose
drained and numb john heads the other way and fails to notice the smoke seeping from under the basement door
john strides down the driveway bleak faced
hes about to straddle the motorcycle when he hears a muffled explosion
he looks back and sees billowing from the side of the house
he bolts towards the front door screams at a jock as he passes
as he races inside
its total chaos
smoke and flames plume up from the basement
terrified teens scramble
john thrashes through the crowd shouting sarah
the panicked evacuation spills out
a window explodes and orange flames lick the cold night air
john sees emily stumble out clutching one of marks dogs abby
went back for dozer
another explosion rocks
a couple of drunk jocks cheer
john looks back at the house
the fire has taken hold with incredible speed
the living room curtains are ablaze
cuts over the sound of the hissing flames
its coming from the second floor
john charges past mark towards the house
its too late
you cant get through
john ignores him and runs into the inferno
flames sprint up the walls and clouds of black smoke spew from the sectional sofa
immune to the heat john heads into the front hall and finds is fully engulfed
fearless he clambers up the flaming steps
his jeans and shirt catch fire
hes almost reached the top when the staircase breaks away behind him and disintegrates in a cloud of embers
its a raging conflagration
the family portraits blister on the walls
john beelines towards dozers plaintive wail which reverberates over the ugly roar of the fire
sarah is crouched by the heavy oak bed that dominates the corner of the room coughing eyes burning from the smoke and heat
dozer is cowered underneath howling
sarah desperately tries to move the bed but it wont budge
the door rips off its hinges
through the smoky half light sarah watches as john strides into the room heroically backlit by flame
dozers under the bed
hes too scared to come out
john strides forward grips the bed with one hand and effortlessly hoists it
sarah looks at him amazed then scrambles forward and gently scoops dozer into her arms
john puts the bed back down
dont let go of him
i promise i wont let go of you
as he lifts them
the trio heads into the hall just as an foot section of the floor collapses in front of them
unfazed john sprints forward and bridges the hole
angle on sarah as she stares at the burning chasm in terror and grips dozer tighter
john touches down on the other side and doesnt slow as he powers down the hall which is a shrieking tunnel of fire
breaks free and swings down in front of them
sarah screams but watches in stunned amazement as john sweeps it out of the way with a telekinetic flick of his hand
the second floor window shatters as john leaps out holding sarah and dozer
a roaring tongue of fire whips his back as he drops to the ground and touches down with sarah and dozer
coughing and shell shocked sarah puts the dog down
she stares at him unsure
you walked through that fire without getting burned
i saw you stop that beam
sirens wail in the distance
ill explain everything
but not here
offering his hand sarah
as they take off into the woods the image freezes then rewinds
john and sarah kneel in the shadows then fly backwards up through the window and into the burning house
reverse to reveal the red haired teen watching playback on his flipvideo camera amazed
he runs to the back of the house and finds mark
check this out man
push in as mark stares at the footage stunned
john and sarah walk in silence dappled in moonlight
he catches her staring at him
please dont look at me like that
im still trying to process everything i saw and i keep coming to the same conclusion what you did isnt possible
it is for me
who are you
off his hesitation for once please tell me the truth
its the hardest thing hes ever had to do
my name isnt john
i dont have a name just a number
in fact my whole life can be reduced to numbers like million thats how many light years it takes to get from my planet to earth
thats how many towns ive lived in
or thats how many days ive been running from an enemy that wants me dead
i lied to you sarah because i lie to everyone
thats how i stay alive
tears of relief brim as he finally reveals his soul
i shouldnt be telling you any of this
emotionally spent john leans against a tree
she steps towards him and brushes her hand down his cheek
i dont care
i just want to be with you
i want that too
but if i stay you could get hurt
i have to leave to keep you safe
sarah absorbs the bitter reality reaches for his hand
theres something i want to give you first
sharpens into focus
its the one annie took of them at thanksgiving
john and sarah stand in the eerie red glow
she gently tongs the image into a bath of fixing solution
so youll always remember me
with exquisite tenderness they kiss
johns palms shimmer
the intensity of the luminescence builds with their rising passion
they sink to the floor and the light crescendos in an ethereal flash that bleaches out the frame
the spinning lights of a trio of fire trucks flare the lens
crews hose down the last smoking embers
a deputy approaches mark who is standing by a police cruiser
the fbi showed up flashing their badges
wanna talk to you
as he points to a black suv thats parked down the street
mark climbs in the back
he looks around nervously as the vehicle starts off
where are we going
is this about the fire
it was an accident
only now do we reverse to reveal sitting in the back
his face is masked in shadow
were hunting for one of the guests at your party
he holds up a netbook which flashes with the flipvideo footage of johns rescue of sarah
its posted on youtube
do you know this boy
yeah john smith
but i didnt invite him
hes a fugitive
weve been tracking him for some time
mark smirks vindicated
ill help you find him
he points to sarahs image on the screen
hes not at sarahs i already checked
and one of my dads deputies drove by his house nada
he poses a great threat to us
where else could he be
mark pulls out his cell phone
ive got sarahs cell number maybe you guys can trace it
the commander takes the phone and passes it to one of his men in the front
he looks back at mark
tell me everything you know about john smith
sam is at the kitchen counter watching the youtube video on his laptop when headlights bleed through the blinds
sam steps out and reacts in surprise as henri emerges through the headlight glare
johns not at the house
is he here
no but hes all over the internet
he turns back to his suv
those things from warsaw theyre coming arent they
go back inside
this isnt your fight
the hell it isnt
im coming with you
off this declaration
the crystal pendant glints against johns chest as he grabs a aparadise higha sweatshirt from a supply closet and yanks it on
sarahs phone suddenly rings startling them
she listens then hands john the phone
henri careens through the night with bernie and sam
where are you
get out now
at that moment all the power in the school dies and the headlights of an suv flash across the window
fear registers in johns eyes as he realizes
the commander climbs out
mark follows but is distracted as a trio of black suvs speeds into the lot followed by a tractor trailer from which inhuman growls echo
what the hells in there
he looks back at the commander who is arming up from the trunk of the suv
mark glimpses the arsenal of future tech machine pistols double bladed swords and heavy duty daggers
he backs away in fearful realization
you guys arent fbi
before he can run a mogadorian soldier grabs him by the neck and constrains him
the commander pulls over his broad shoulders
the cartridges are made of crystal and swirl with purple light
finally he slips on his trademark red coat and spins towards the school
one of johns hands holds sarahs while the other lights their way as they hurtle down the passage
theyve almost reached the doors when they suddenly fly open and
struts into view
we recognize her as the mysterious teen girl
she swings up an awesome hand cannon and fires right at them
the blast scorches the air between john and sarah but takes out the who was stalking up the hall behind them
john watches in shock as the mogadorian keels over and shatters into embers
john swings back to the teen girl as she strides forward
you oughta keep your heroics off the internet
who the hell are you
wheres your cepan
on his way
the mogs got her four months ago
we had been tracking them
she heads past
john and sarah follow after her
we discovered they plan to attack earth
the only thing standing in their way is the six of us
the revelation hits john like a wrecking ball
you know what that means
john nods with new purpose
the war starts tonight
first we have to get out of here alive and find the others
six leads them past the impressive trophy case
what are we up against
theres a commander a bunch of soldiers and two piken
theyll have all the main entrances covered
the gym theres a tunnel under the stage
itll take us out to the stadium
six acknowledges that info with a curt nod
six grabs john and sarah by their arms and yanks them back against the wall
they hold their breath as one of the mogadorian soldiers prowls straight past
he stops for a moment then turns the corner
sarah looks across at the mirrored trophy case and sees theres no reflection
john realizes turns to six
you got any other legacies
i can control the elements
lumen and telekinesis
john turns and watches in horror as the mogadorian commander and a trio of mogadorian soldiers sweeps into view
the commander is holding he is ashen with fear
sarah has to catch herself from screaming
john makes a move but six holds him in place
they want to draw you out
hes not dying because of me
angle on the soldiers and mark
theyre heading past the trophy case when johns voice booms out of nowhere
mark rips free and hits the deck a second before the trophy case explodes
shards of glass rip into the mogadorians and trophies torpedo off the shelves and impale the aliens against the far wall
the mogadorians scream as they flail
john sarah and six break cover
john wrenches mark to his feet and they take off running
they dash around the next corner and find sprinting towards them followed by two mogadorians
six raises her hand cannon blows one of the mogs away while john safely leads everybody into
barricade the doors
john telekinetically uproots a trio of bookcases that fly across the space and block the door
sarah turns to mark who is totally shell shocked
what are you doing with them
they said they were fbi
that john was a fugitive
what the hells going on
youve stumbled into a war
so shut up and keep your head down
i see age hasnt mellowed your attitude
mark turns to john guilt wracked
i didnt know they were trying to kill you
genuine to john im sorry
this isnt your fault its mine
he offers mark his hand
mark shakes it
suddenly bernie begins to growl
what is it boy
henri sees where bernie is staring and realizes
hes telling us to run
they take off a second before pummel rams through the wall in a shower of bricks books and paper
it utters a glass shattering roar
john looks back and sees bernie bravely holding his ground
he watches as the beagle sprints forward and launches himself at the monster
bernie clamps onto the pikens neck
hes hopelessly outmatched and holds on for dear life as the piken tries to buck him off
then something amazing happens he doubles triples in size and keeps growing
his features become reptilian gecko like his fur turns to spines and in a matter of moments bernie has transformed into a hulking john looks to henri as the truth
of bernies origin dawns
bernies a chimera
he came with us from lorien
guess i wasnt the only one keeping secrets
somebody had to watch you when i wasnt around
they exit while bernie and the piken continue to battle
john and henri catch up to the others
the gyms this way
a projectile hisses past johns ear and detonates a row of lockers booooom
its like an incendiary grenade
the paint blisters off the lockers as they are consumed by fire
sees two mogadorian soldiers hauling heavy duty weapons that use the glass cartridges that glow on their ammo belts
one fires another round
john telekinetically rips a door off its hinges
it flies forward blocks the charge and ignites
john spins back and screams go
they take off
john follows and uses his telekinesis to fling cabinets doors benches anything he can to block the fiery onslaught
but the rounds are coming too fast and a projectile smacks him in the back
its like being hit by napalm
as flames wash across him he looks up and snaps on that run the length of the hall
a deluge sprays dousing the fire
with his clothes smoking john tears around the corner
the mogadorians charge after him but find boooomm
she blasts them at point blank range
magenta light gushes from their wounds
like rain hitting hot coals their bodies hiss as they crack and cinder
henri mark sarah and sam race out of view
then john sees something emerge through the smoky water choked haze
it utters a low predatory growl and launches itself forward
oddly six doesnt move
she closes her eyes and lays one hand on the flooded floor turning the water to
in a matter of moments the hall has been transformed into an icy tunnel
the sprinklers spray snow
the piken struggles to find purchase in this new frozen environment and slip slides after john and six who disappear into
the doors are demolished as the piken flails off the ice
it takes out a row of tables and chairs and skids to a stop
it roars in humiliated fury and its red eyes scan for john and six who are nowhere to be seen
the piken prowls behind the serving counter
snow beads off its back
its monstrous nostrils suddenly flare sensing something
it hunches lower and peers at the trays and pans that are stored below
reveal john and six
john clutches sixs arm
theyre lying between a stack of roasting dishes
threads of foamy drool drip onto their faces as the piken pokes its head further
its ghoulish red eyes seem to stare right at them
with a final frustrated snort it carries on
henri sarah sam and mark race into view
sarah stops panicked and afraid
right behind us
he offers her his hand
shes about to take it when steps out of the shadows
there is nowhere and no time for henri and the others to run
but as the mogadorian squeezes the trigger of his hand cannon the wall on his right bernie and the first piken crash into the hall
they are still at each others throats and dont even notice as they steam roller over the mogadorian squashing him like a bug
the creatures smash through the opposite wall and out of sight
its over in a violent blink
john and six sneak through the shadows
she steps to the door but it wont budge
theyve blocked it
use your telekinesis
were not leaving without my friends
dont you mean the girl
john ignores the jibe and turns back
six grabs his arm
i broke the elders spell to find you
the mogs can kill me now
we have to go
we stay and fight
off his determination
henri and sam crouch behind one station while sarah and mark hide in the one opposite
henri pulls a selection of weapons from the backpack
he hands one to sam looks over at mark
you know how to use one of these
my dads the sheriff
he slides two across the floor
the door opens
they swing up to fire but find john and six
save it for the mogs
bernie and the piken pummel the rows of lockers which collapse like dominos
gashed and exhausted the battling duo shatter smashes into water spurts from a broken pipe
the piken slips on the slick tiles
as it struggles to right itself bernie seizes the moment and sinks his fangs into the monsters neck
its talons viciously rip into bernies side
ignoring the pain bernie doesnt let go until his foe finally jerks to stillness
as bernie sinks to the floor he morphs back into a beagle and lies spent and bleeding
john leads the group past the bleachers and points to the side of the stage
the doors over here
the tunnel leads out to the stadium
sarah sweeps back the curtain revealing a padlocked set of metal doors
john holds up his hand snaps the lock and whips the chain free
the doors fly open spring out of the dark
one tackles henri while the other blindsides john
henri struggles until the blast cinders the mogs head clean off
henri looks over and sees mark holding a smoking shotgun and nods his thanks
the second has john pinned when it suddenly roars in agony and disintegrates into a shower of sparks revealing she sheathes her dagger and helps john up
saving your life
my new hobby
sarah notices a smile of respect flicker between john and six
three mogadorian knives razor the air
one impales six in the shoulder
she slumps at johns feet
henri opens fire on the who storm towards them
john screams to sam and mark
get her down the tunnel
they grab six by the arms and drag her into the tunnel
sarah glances back at john and follows after them
henri takes out a soldier
john sweeps up his hand and
the commander and the other soldier are sent flying as the planks rip free of their nails
john and henri charge into the tunnel
the doors fly shut behind them and the bleacher stand rolls forward to seal the entrance
sarah is in the lead
sam and mark follow holding the wounded six
theyve almost reached the end when lurches into the mouth of the tunnel
without a seconds hesitation sam swings up his gun and blasts it
mark looks at him in shock as they race through the embers
i play a lot of xbox
sam mark six and sarah hurtle across the field
when they reach the track sarah looks back and smiles with relief when john and henri burst out of the tunnel
get to the woods
she nods and exits with the others
john and henri head onto the field after them when leaps out of the mouth of the tunnel behind them
its seriously pissed
it bounds straight towards john
its fangs glint like barbed wire as it launches itself towards him
at the last second nobly shoves john out of the way and is plucked into the pikens jaws
the creature shakes him like a rag doll and flings him feet down the field
john watches anguished as henri lands in a heap
the piken pivots turns its crimson eyes on john
it almost seems to smirk
its fangs are stained with henris blood
johns face hardens into a mask of rage
he makes no attempt to flee as the piken charges
as it springboards into the air
angle on johns hands as they suddenly clench
angle on the goalposts as theyre snapped clean off their bases and fly skyward
angle on john as the pikens shadow washes across him
angle on the piken as it arcs towards john with its mouth open and teeth bared
suddenly the goalposts spear its flanks impaling it like supersize bbq forks
the three ton killing machine drops out of the sky and smacks onto the yard line
john watches impassively as the red life fire dies in its eyes and its head lolls to one side
the stadium looms in the distance
sam wrenches the dagger from sixs shoulder while sarah and mark anxiously watch
john sinks by henris side
henri groans as john cradles his head
his coat is soaked with blood and his torso is horribly mauled
john tries to drag him to his feet
come on taillights in five
i wont be coming with you this time
we go together
henri smiles grateful but at that moment flies past john and impales henri in the chest
henri utters a groan and his dying eyes meet johns
find the others
his voice is a gravelled whisper
your life is my life
his eyes flutter closed and he slips from johns grip
anguished john doesnt notice his pendant momentarily flicker with a radiant blue light
he angrily spins to face but in a blur of speed the commander steps forward wraps his hand around johns throat and plucks him into the air
hes flanked by the remaining soldiers
johns feet kick uselessly as hes lifted face to face
three loric pendants dangle from the commanders belt like mocking trophies
your cepan saved you on lorien
the commanders voice hisses with cruel certainty
he wrenches his sword from henris corpse
but this moment was inevitable
the blade shimmers with silver flame as he raises it
johns eyes narrow as the sword sweeps towards him
this is the moment his adolescence officially ends
this is the moment when a warrior is born
angle on blade as it shatters into a million pieces which flutter to the ground like glittering confetti
john stares at the alien with calm confidence
nothing is inevitable
the flame is hotter and brighter than acetylene torches
he grips one of the commanders bandoliers
tight on the mogadorians face as he realizes its over
the glass cartridges detonate in a deadly chain reaction
john the commander the mogadorian soldiers in fact every goddamn thing in the stadium is obliterated in the that radiates across the field like a blinding ring of hell
sarah looks back as the blistering vortex of flame lights the night sky
her breath catches in her throat
oh my god
before anyone can stop her she takes off running sprinting for the stadium
its a smoking ruin
the seats have melted into puddles
sarah bursts into view
she looks across the devastated field
the grass has been reduced to a charred black carpet of stubble
nothing remains of henri or the mogadorians
she charges across the broiled expanse hoping against hope
then she sees john lying motionless and naked his clothes completely burned away
she stops puts her hand to her mouth to stifle a sob when he coughs and stirs
ash swirls like snow as she races to his side
they wrap each other in their arms
neither wanting to ever let go
the sky is cracked with the first light of day
sarah is dressing sixs wound at a table
sorry girl scout first aid didnt cover extraterrestrial dagger wounds
six smiles grateful
as the two teens size each other up camera finds mark
he hangs up his cell and crosses to john and sam who are talking intently by the motorcycles
john is now wearing a pair of old jeans and a faded denim jacket
the sheriffs department is starting to put up roadblocks
you guys better get moving
six and sarah join them
you good to go
dont worry about me
john nods to sam
sam ride with six
we dont need baggage
sam steps in front of her determined
i have to find out if the mogs took my dad
six turns to john who is not bending then glares at sam
you slow us down ill shoot you myself
sarah looks at john tries to rein in her emotions
i want to come too
you need to stay here
you could have died last night
im not putting you in danger again
marks promised to look after you
tears tumble down her cheeks
i dont want to say goodbye
ill come back for you
when its safe
she bows her head anguished
he gently lifts her chin
where im from we only give our heart to one person
ive given mine to you
i love you sarah
their lips meet and they kiss
it only ends when john hears an urgent rustle in the woods
they turn and watch as limps into view
blood mats his fur and his face is scratched but hes alive
off johns relief
sam sits behind six on her motorcycle
john holds bernie as he straddles his harley
bernie morphs into a gecko and darts into his pocket
sarah studies john and six unsure
john throttles the bike to life then looks back at sarah
he fights a pang of jealousy when he sees her standing at marks side
rain spits as the motorcycles start off
this is the first town ive left without henri
the first one i have a reason to come back to
john and sarah hold each others gaze desperately trying to brand the image of their faces onto their memories
the bikes blur past the awelcome to paradisea sign
he warned me the pain would be unbearable if i left her
he was right
a straight stretch of blacktop bisects the sunbaked flatness
but i dont regret it
the pain reminds me whats at stake
a dust trail plumes as the bikes power into view
we must find the others and face our enemy together
im not sure how we can stop them
but nothing is inevitable
i know that now
thunderheads darken the horizon
i am number
his eyes are fearless and his face is undaunted by the battles yet to be fought
hes ready to face a future unmapped and uncharted
