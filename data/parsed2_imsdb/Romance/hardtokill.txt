the two shadow men are obscured by the shack and the position of calabrese and vitale

storm soundlessly lowers the lookout to the ground
storm shakes a sore hand and notices its cut
kneeling down to the outstretched heap he finds the cause of his injury one of mikeys teeth wiggles freely in his fingers
storm plucks the tooth and folds it inside the big guys hand

two dark figures with shotguns leveled fill the door
there is an eruption of gunfire and blinding muzzle blast and smoke
in the dim light for a moment we do not know what has happened then we see one of the assassins thrown backward jacket blown open at the shoulder
we see storm hit badly at close range
he takes it in the right center mass
it looks like his right arm is torn off as his
is literally blown across the room
felicia is now hysterically screaming but not for long as she is mortally wounded
we are sure storm will collapse and this horror will be over but storm rushes the remaining assailant and tilting his body sideways as he enters he avoids one more
the momentum of storms quick spin catches the assailant perfectly and like a fast spinning top slammed against another storm has the puppet by the strings
he clamps down with his left and only good hand on the assailants right hand and uses it against the gun as a tool for more torque
spinning him around until he is at the peak of his circle storm with all his might spins his whole body in the opposite direction quickly using the whipping effect
of his shoulder and hip to snap the assailants wrist and flip him violently
there is a loud crack and scream as he lands on his head and neck and then from the side point blank another ferocious shotgun blast storm is blown into

ford steps out
eerie ultraviolet motionless forms steady hum of monitoring equipment and the shuffle of the killers shoes
moving purposefully from bed to bed checking each chart for the right name
danny helps storm out of the tub
checking the chart in the dim blue when a flashlight ray suddenly hits his face
excuse me doctor
i have to check everyone on the upper floors
comes forward no suspicion can i just get your i
russ takes the silenced shot right between the eyes
his body collapses in a heap there in the entry
danny wheels storm through the big swinging doors

reacts as if fearing russ has had a heart attack
he leaves storm rushes forward to investigate
storm strains to see
dashes up russ

danny sprawls onto the floor dead
doesnt need to see to recognize that sound
he gropes at once for the wall corner trying to propel his litter back through the swinging doors and out of sight
storm strains for it his limbs maddeningly uncooperative stretching pawing
until he claws far enough to reach where the janitors mop rests against the wall
steps into the hallway peering up and down just as storm slides out of view
the killer grabs dannys body by the ankles to drag it back out of sight
just then backs through the double doors at the other end of the hall trying to balance an overloaded tray of supplies shes carrying
she and ford are momentarily in full view of each other
but backs turned
suddenly ford hears andy
andy carefully heads that way the two corpses visible ahead and the killer poised to waste her
but shes concentrating on the overloaded tray traveling closer closer
until she turns off into the medicine room
ford swiftly hauls both corpses out of sight
storm weakly awkwardly rows himself toward the elevators with the mop handle
then using his hands trying to grasp the wall and push himself along

he makes it within reach of the call button and stabs at it with the mop handle
then bulls eye
the light comes on
ford has found the last storms medical chart and the empty bed
hes heading back frustrated angry out toward the hall when
the elevator bell dings
storm struggles to push himself inside
everything an excruciating effort
the doors slap into his litter trying to close
hindering him as he throws a look toward stalks this way ears tuned to the slapping doors ahead around the corner
he breaks into a trot makes it all the way in with a final heave
the doors not yet closed and rounds the corner just as they shut
races forward storm jabs at the panel for the lobby button but the shaky mop handle hits th floor instead
the killer hears this hears the elevator start up
he punches the call button
the other elevator opens
he plunges in just as comes out of the medicine room and spots blood on the floor hurries forward sees russ and dannys bodies

she backs off in horror
andy rushes to the ward station lunges for the phone finds its been cut
her view into the coma room suddenly brings the realization that storms bed is still gone
the doors open revealing a dark deserted seventh floor still under construction
he registers the opposing elevator rising his way jabbing again at the control panel
doors wide open
any button will do just close the goddam door
fords elevator arrives
we make out the killers form just as storms doors close
storm blows huge relief
looks to see what he finally pushed
the rd floor button
he puts the mop to the side wall and shoves himself with all hes got
the gurney wheels around and places him right next to the control panel
storm twists onto his side and slams a hand over the emergency stop button
but the button jams
and storms thrusting hand has pushed his gurney even farther away
he cant reach it
he feels the elevator about to stop at a floor
claws at the mop as a weapon
raises it with all his feeble strength
the doors open and andy crashes into him
hoarse weak help me
pounding down the steps three at a time
gun in hand
andy hauls storms litter full tilt out of the elevator

too weak to break the fall

cane propped up he manages to somehow stand again
hes absolutely exhausted

he misses his mouth getting the rice all down his beard
spilling a little too much to ignore and at first it looks like hes going to explode

having made some decision she enters
oh im sorry

but he tries very hard to maintain his one objective in life to get very strong and win the upcoming battle
he looks at this woman who now looks more beautiful than anyone he has ever seen

there is a brief moment of hesitation and a look of disbelief between the boys and then boom
ford tries to hand storm a pool cue as if storms head is a baseball and the cue is a bat
this doesnt work very well as storm enters and simultaneously grabs fords cue using his momentum to slam his head down onto the edge of the pool table
we hear fords skull crack and he goes down
almost instantly another pool cue in joness hands slashes toward storms head
this time storm has his own tool and takes his cue to intercept the one about to connect with his head
he again uses the power of the attackers momentum and as soon as his cue goes down so does storms onto the back of joness skull with so much force
we hear the neck snap at the same time the cue splinters in half
storm is left with the jagged tip of the skinny end
dunne knowing hell never make it in time to the couch at the rear of the room lunges at storm with a butcher knife he seizes from a tray of
cold cuts on a side table
storm traps the knife and quickly guides it into dunnes midsection
with the other hand he raises the sharpened end of the pool stick and slams it down dunnes throat via the windpipe
thats for my wife
fuck you and die
dunne falls to his knees and just stares
storm does a flying kick to his chin breaking his neck
the room now finished he turns and exits
holland pours himself a nervous drink

shocked he nervously looks around
seeing nothing he picks up the note and reads it
anticipation of death is worse than death itself
a faint smile comes to his face with great confidence
as he backs out of the toilet he pulls his pistol from his shoulder holster cocking it
he cautiously exits
holland as he moves toward the sporting room and his support team
he enters the area of carnage and the smug confidence on his face starts to change to a slight worry
he then starts carefully making his way back to the indoor pool to inform trent
holland enters the area and finds no one
now the look on his face is one of fear and confusion
but he has a plan
his plan is to try to make it out of the house in one piece
what was once careful stalking has turned into panicked blundering
continue tracking holland as he bumps into things knocking them over retreating wildly
he passes a raging fireplace and suddenly out of the shadows comes a voice how does it feel to know youre about to die

hes swinging like maniac and we hear the sound of the poker slashing the but he gets too close to storm who snatches the poker away from him
they are like two vicious cats whirling

storm then begins the search for trent
he casually strolls through the house calling as if hes playing hide and seek with a childhood friend
vernon oh verrrrrnon where are you
storm opens closets looks in drawers under the toilet seat and then proceeds into loud enough for trent to hear lets see
where could that bad boy be
from the tragic violent rage to what almost seems like a kiddie game we are not sure if storm has gone mad or what
he approaches the master closet as he continues the taunting melody
storm enters and begins pushing the clothes of the racks aside looking for something thats probably not there
trent is too smart for this shit
hes probably on a jet to the bahamas by now

storm reaches to shove it aside when with shocking and deafening suddenness a shotgun blast erupts point blank shredding worth of suit jackets and barely missing storms head
instantly a figure leaps out
storm gently disarms him and the two men are for a moment frozen eye to eye
storm seems to drift off somewhere far away and then violently slams trent up against the wall pinning his chest with the left hand
storm takes the sawed off shotgun by the handle and punches the barrel straight into trents mouth
the barrel simply goes through the teeth and in his mouth
it appears storm has made up his mind about what to do
trents eyes bug out of his head
storm now takes trent by the hair and leads him through the house shotgun still in his mouth
you know trent i want to kill you so bad i can barely contain myself
but i keep thinking that death is far too merciful a fate for you and that a nice petite white bread boy like you in a federal penitentiary
pause let me put it this way i doubt whether you could remain anal retentive for very long
i think thats best for you trent is now so fucking scared he looks like he is about to go out of his mind
about this time in their journey through the house storm has stopped before hollands mangled and lifeless body
if you think trent was scared before you should see him now
storm curiously turns his back on trent for a moment to pick up handcuffs off the floor
trent sees his last chance
trent seizes the poker and does his most mighty babe ruth impression
just as storm stands up the poker comes flying
it looks like storm is dead but somehow he steps inside the arc and does shihonage which disarms trent and flips him backwards head first into the fire
trents neck is impaled by one of the decorative iron arrows of the fireplace
he is stuck struggling to free himself from the arrow as his head catches fire
a fate somewhat worse than prison

storm turns away we are not sure where we are yet
in the distance we see a procession of marching men all wearing kilts and all the accoutrements of traditional scottish garb
in the front several paces ahead of the neatly marching lines of men is a single bagpiper
behind all of them is a hearse being nobly escorted by mounted police
now we see them fully the colors the feeling the emotion of caring men marching in the funeral parade of a fallen comrade
camera pans over to reveal a section of mourners mostly police but with some civilians
the camera moves closer and pans to the front row where we see storm in full police regalia a medal of valor around his neck
andy and sonny are standing near at sober attention
the procession stops and the lone bagpiper continues to play the dirge as he walks up and takes his position on a section of lawn
the pallbearers remove the flag from the casket and present it to the chief of police who now slowly approaches the group of mourners and stops directly in front of
he presents the flag and salutes sonny
the lone bagpiper stops and an officer on trumpet begins playing taps
the coffin is slowly lowered
finally the film that storm shot that night seven years ago on the wharf
spliced with the audiotape with subtitles including each speakers name to make every word and identity clear
we see the two shadow men step from the station wagon
the pushed film clearly reveals them to be trent and holland
we see them conspire with calabrese and vitale
murder is a serious business my friend
and an expensive one

im up to here with caution
this bleep lives on alfalfa sprouts and bean curd he aint gonna die of natural cause
our shot starts to widen revealing that the tv monitor is in a news studio
the nightly news is being broadcast what we see on this monitor is simultaneously going out over the air
as the shot widens and traverses we begin to see the actual news set including esposito who got his well deserved scoop and other anchorpeople crewmen etc
all im counseling is a little patience
the man is public
hes in the paper every day
well the next time i read about him it better be in the obituaries
continue move as the wharf scene keeps playing
the tv monitor passes out of frame sound goes down were moving past the news set and its occupants who are readying to go back on camera as soon as
the wharf tape ends and on which now fill the frame bright and blinding
the screen starts to bleach out
it goes white and above a perfect peaceful sea
a small powerboat the kind that you rent from the dock moves into frame
storm steers it standing up
andy and sonny in the back cockpit seat
she switches a channel up comes the same footage we just saw on the news set
it takes a beat before she realizes what it is

seven year storm
indicates tv i told you youd be famous
storm takes a step so he can see the screen
views it for a short beat then picks the tv up from andys lap and while its still playing heaves it over the side and into the drink
bobs for a few moments
then sinks beneath the surface
whyd you do that
watching the last ripples from the sinking set
a moment between him and himself when the past is allowed to slip away sink out of sight making way for the future
storm turns back from the water surface to his son and to the woman he loves
he sits letting the boat drift wherever it wants to and tugs andy down beside him
then he reaches across to his son pulls the boy to him with a playful headlock
for a moment both andy and sonny are held in suspension wondering what storm will do or say
finally to sonny knock knock
for a beat the boy is taken aback
then he breaks into a broad smile
storm glances to andy pulling her tighter to him

you dont have to cry about it
a beat then i love you both
storm hugs his son with great affection pulling andy to him with his other arm
this is their beginning
drifts its happy way across the sun shimmering sea
