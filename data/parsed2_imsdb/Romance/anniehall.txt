fade out credits abrupt medium close up of alvy singer doing a comedy monologue
he wearing a crumbled sports jacket and tieless shirt the background is stark
theres an old joke
uh two elderly women are at a catskills mountain resort and one of em says boy the food at this place is really terrible
the other one says yeah i know and such
well thats essentially how i feel about life
full of loneliness and misery and suffering and unhappiness and its all over much too quickly
the the other important joke for me is one thats uh usually attributed to groucho marx but i think it appears originally in freuds wit and its relation to the
and it goes like this im paraphrasing uh
i would never wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member
thats the key joke of my adult life in terms of my relationships with women
tsch you know lately the strangest things have been going through my mind cause i turned forty tsch and i guess im going through a life crisis or something i
and im not worried about aging
im not one o those characters you know
although im balding slightly on top thats about the worst you can say about me
i uh i think im gonna get better as i get older you know
i think im gonna be the the balding virile type you know as opposed to say the uh distinguished gray for instance you know
less im neither o those two
unless im one o those guys with saliva dribbling out of his mouth who wanders into a cafeteria with a shopping bag screaming about socialism
sighing annie and i broke up and i i still cant get my mind around that
you know i i keep sifting the pieces of the relationship through my mind and and examining my life and tryin to figure out where did the screw up come
you know and a year ago we were
tsch in love
you know and and and and its funny im not im not a morose type
im not a depressive character
i i i uh laughing you know i was a reasonably happy kid i guess
i was brought up in brooklyn during world war ii
alvy as young boy sits on a sofa with his mother in an old fashioned cluttered doctors office
the doctor stands near the sofa holding a cigarette and listening
to the doctor hes been depressed
all off a sudden he cant do anything
nodding why are you depressed alvy
nudging alvy tell dr
young alvy sits his head down
his mother answers for him its something he read
puffing on his cigarette and nodding something he read huh
his head still down the universe is expanding
the universe is expanding
looking up at the doctor well the universe is everything and if its expanding someday it will break apart and that would be the end of everything
disgusted his mother looks at him
shouting what is that your business
she turns back to the doctor he stopped doing his homework
whats the point
excited gesturing with her hands what has the universe got to do with it
youre here in brooklyn
brooklyn is not expanding
heartily looking down at alvy it wont be expanding for billions of years yet alvy
and weve gotta try to enjoy ourselves while were here
fall shot of house with an amusement park roller coaster ride built over it
a line of cars move up and then slides with great speed while out the window of the house a band shakes a dust mop
my analyst says i exaggerate my childhood memories but i swear i was brought up underneath the roller alvy as a child sits at the table eating soup and reading
a comic book while his father sits on the sofa reading the paper
the house shakes with every move of the roller coaster
coaster in the coney island section of brooklyn
maybe that accounts for my personality which is a little nervous i think
young alvy at the food stand concession watching three military men representing the army the navy and the marines arm in arm with a blond woman in a skirted bathing
they all turn and run toward the foreground
the girl stops before the camera to lean over and throw a kiss
the sign over the concession reads steves famous clam bar
ice cold beer and the roller coaster is moving in full gear in the background
you know i have a hyperactive imagination
my mind tends to jump around a little and have some trouble between fantasy and reality
full shot of people in bumper cars thoroughly enjoying bumping into each other as alvy father stands in the center of the track directing traffic
my father ran the bumper car concession
alvy as a child moves into the frame driving a bumper car
he stops as other cars bombard him
his father continues to direct the traffic there there he is and there i am
but i i i i used to get my aggression out through those cars all the time
alvy backs up his car off screen
the camera pans over three austere looking teachers standing in front of the blackboard
the chalk writing on the board changes as each teacher lectures
while alvy speaks one of the male teachers puts an equation on the blackboard
x and other arithmetic formulas
i remember the staff at our public school
you know we had a saying uh that those who cant do teach and those who cant teach teach gym
and uh hh of course those who couldnt do anything i think were assigned to our school
i must say a female teacher standing in front of an old fashioned schoolroom
the blackboard behind her reads transportation administration
the camera pans her point of view a group of young students sitting behind their desks
alvy as a child sits in a center desk wile all around him there is student activity there is note passing ruler tapping nose picking gumchewing
i always felt my schoolmates were idiots
melvyn greenglass you know fat little face and henrietta farrell just miss perfect all the time
and and ivan ackerman always the wrong answer
ivan stands up behind his desk
seven and three is nine
alvy hits his forehead with his hand
another student glances over at him reacting
even then i knew they were just jerks
the camera moves back to the teacher who is glaring out at her students in nineteen forty two i had already dis as alvy talks the camera shows him move
from his seat and kiss a young girl
she jumps from her seat in disgust rubbing her cheek as alvy moves back to his seat
making noises ugh he kissed me he kissed me
off screen thats the second time this month
step up here
as the teacher really glaring now speaks alvy rises from his seat and moves over to her
angry she points with her band while the students turn their heads to watch what will happen next
whatd i do
step up here
whatd i do
you should be ashamed of yourself
the students their heads still turned look back at alvy now an adult sitting in the last seat of the second row
first off screen then onscreen as camera moves over to the back of the classroom why i was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity
the younger alvy standing next to her six year old boys dont have girls on their minds
still sitting in the back of the classroom i did
the girl the young alvy kissed turns to the older alvy she gestures and speaks
for gods sakes alvy even freud speaks of a latency period
gesturing well i never had a latency period
i cant help it
with young alvy still at her side why couldnt you have been more like donald
the camera pans over to donald sitting up tall in his seat then back to the teacher now there was a model boy
still standing next to the teacher tell the folks where you are today donald
i run a profitable dress company
sometimes i wonder where my classmates are today
the camera shows the full classroom the students sitting behind their desks the teacher standing in the front of the room
one at a time the young students rise u from their desks and speak
im president of the pinkus plumbing company
i sell tallises
i used to be a heroin addict
now im a methadone addict
im into leather
close up of a tv screen showing alvy as an adult on a talk show
he sits next to the show host dick cavett a navy man sits on his right
static is heard throughout the dialogue
i lost track of most of my old schoolmates but i wound up a comedian
they did not take me in the army
i was uh
interestingly enough i was i was four p
sounds of tv audience laughter and applause are heard
in in in in the event of war im a hostage
more audience laughter joined by dick cavett and the naval officer
alvys mother sits at the old fashioned dining room table peeling carrots and talking as she looks off screen
you always only saw the worst in people
you never could get along with anyone at school
you were always outta step with the world
even when you got famous you still distrusted the world
a pretty manhattan street with sidewalk trees brownstones a school people mill about some strolling and carrying bundles others buried
the screen shows the whole length of the sidewalk a street and part of the sidewalk beyond
as the following scene ensues two pedestrians indistinguishable in the distance come closer and closer toward the camera recognizable finally as alvy and his best friend rob deep in conversation
they eventually move past the camera and off screen
traffic noise is heard in the background
i distinctly heard it
he muttered under his breath jew

we were walking off the tennis court and you know he was there and me and his wife and he looked at her and then they both looked at me
and under his breath he said jew

i think i have a few minutes left
alvy stands in front of glass doors of theater the ticket taker behind him just inside the glass doors
the sounds of city traffic car horns honking can be heard while he looks around waiting for annie
a man in a black leather jacket walking past the theater stops in front of alvy
he looks at him then moves away
he stops a few steps farther and turns around to look at alvy again
alvy looks away then back at the man
the man continues to stare
alvy scratches his head looking for annie and trying not to notice the man
the man still staring walks back to alvy
hey you on television

alvy is getting more and more uneasy as the man talks more and more people move through the doors of the theater
im uh im robert redford
laughing come on

thanks very much
they shake hands and alvy pats the mans arm
the man in turn looks over his shoulder and motions to another man
all excited now he points to alvy and calls out
alvy looks impatient
off screen what

the tv star
nodding his head yes alvy shoves nd man aside and moves to the curb of the sidewalk
the two men follow still talking over the traffic noise
alvy singer over here
a cab moves into the frame and stops by the curb
alvy moves over to it about to get in
overlapping the two men and stuttering i i i i its all right fellas
as alvy opens the cab door the two men still behind him annie gets out jesus whatd you do come by way of the panama canal
overlapping alvy alright alright im in a bad mood okay
annie closes the cab door and she and alvy move over to the ticket booth of the theater as they continue to talk
im standing with the cast of the godfather
youre gonna hafta learn to deal with it
im dealing with two guys named cheech
they move into the ticket line still talking
a billboard next to them reads ingmar bergmans face please i have a headache all right
hey you are in a bad mood
you you you must be getting your period
im not getting my period
jesus every time anything out of the ordinary happens you think that im getting my period
they move over to the ticket counter people in front of them buying tickets and walking off screen
gesturing a li little louder
i think one of them may have missed it
to the ticket clerk hm has the picture started yet
it started two minutes ago
hitting his hand on the counter thats it
i i cant go in
two minutes alvy
overlapping annie no im sorry i cant do it
we weve blown it already
i you know uh i i cant go in in the middle

alvy nods his head yes and lets out an exasperated sigh well only miss the titles
theyre in swedish
you wanna get coffee for two hours or something
well go next two hours
no u uh im going in

she moves past the ticket clerk
waving to annie go ahead
annie moves back to alvy and takes his arm
look while were talking we could be inside you know that
watching people with tickets move past them hey can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody cause i get embarrassed
all right all right so whatta you wanna do
i dont know now
you you wanna go to another movie
annie nods her head and shrugs her shoulders disgustedly as alvy gesturing with his band looks at her so lets go see the sorrow and the pity
oh come on weve seen it
im not in the mood to see a four hour documentary on nazis
well im sorry i i cant
i i ive gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish cause cause im anal
laughing now hh thats a polite word for what you are
a lined up crowd of ticket holders waiting to get into the theater alvy and annie among them
a bum of indistinct chatter can be heard through the ensuing scene
loudly to his companion right behind alvy and annie we saw the fellini film last tuesday
it is not one of his best
it lacks a cohesive structure
you know you get the feeling that hes not absolutely sure what it is he wants to say
course ive always felt he was essentially a a technical film maker
granted la strada was a great film
great in its use of negative energy more than anything else
but that simple cohesive core
alvy reacting to the mans loud monologue starts to get annoyed while annie begins to read her newspaper
overlapping the mans speech im im im gonna have a stroke
reading well stop listening to him
overlapping alvy and annie you know it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another
you know what im talking about
sighing hes screaming his opinions in my ear
like all that juliet of the spirits or satyricon i found it incredibly
you know he really is
hes one of the most indulgent film makers
he really is overlapping key word here is indulgent
overlapping without getting
well lets put it this way
to annie who is still reading overlapping the man in line who is still talking what are you depressed about
i missed my therapy
how can you possibly oversleep
the alarm clock
gasping you know what a hostile gesture that is to me
i know because of our sexual problem right
everybody in line at the new yorker has to know our rate of intercourse
its like samuel beckett you know i admire the technique but he doesnt
he doesnt hit me on a gut level
to annie id like to hit this guy on a gut level
the man in line continues his speech all the while alvy and annie talk
stop it alvy
wringing his hands well hes spitting on my neck
you know hes spitting on my neck when he talks
and then the most important thing of all is a comedians vision
and you know something else
you know youre so egocentric that if i miss my therapy you can think of it in terms of how it affects you
lighting a cigarette while he talks gal gun shy is what it is
reacting again to the man in line probably on their first date right
still going on its a narrow view
probably met by answering an ad in the new york review of books
thirtyish academic wishes to meet woman whos interested in mozart james joyce and sodomy
he sighs then to annie whatta you mean our sexual problem
i i i mean im comparatively normal for a guy raised in brooklyn
okay im very sorry
my sexual problem
okay my sexual problem
the man in front of them turns to look at them then looks away
i never read that
that was that was henry james right
novel uh the sequel to turn of the screw
even louder now its the influence of television
yeah now marshall mcluhan deals with it in terms of it being a a high uh high intensity you understand
a hot medium
as opposed to a
more and more aggravated what i wouldnt give for a large sock o horse manure
as opposed to a print
alvy steps forward waving his hands in frustration and stands facing the camera
sighing and addressing the audience what do you do when you get stuck in a movie line with a guy like this behind you
i mean its just maddening
the man in line moves toward alvy
both address the audience now
wait a minute why cant i give my opinion
its a free country
i mean d he can give you do you hafta give it so loud
i mean arent you ashamed to pontificate like that
and and the funny part of it is m marshall mcluhan you dont know anything about marshall mcluhans
overlapping wait a minute
i happen to teach a class at columbia called tv media and culture
so i think that my insights into mr
mcluhan well have a great deal of validity
oh do yuh
well thats funny because i happen to have mr
mcluhan right here
so here just let me i mean all right
come over here
alvy gestures to the camera which follows him and the man in line to the back of the crowded lobby
he moves over to a large stand up movie poster and pulls marshall mcluban from behind the poster
to mcluban tell him
to the man in line i hear i heard what you were saying
you you know nothing of my work
you mean my whole fallacy is wrong
how you ever got to teach a course in anything is totally amazing
to the camera boy if life were only like this
credits appear over the faces of the soldiers
chronicle of a french town during the occupation over credits and soldiers june fourteenth nineteen forty the german army occupies paris
all over the country people are desperate for every available scrap of news
annie is sitting up in bed reading
off screen boy those guys in the french resistance were really brave you know
got to listen to maurice chevalier sing so much
mm i dont know sometimes i ask myself how id stand up under torture
off screen you
he moves into the frame lying across the bed to touch annie who makes a face if the gestapo would take away your bloomingdales charge card youd tell em everything
that movie makes me feel guilty
yeah cause its supposed to
he starts kissing annies arm
she gets annoyed and continues to read
what what what whats the matter
i you know i dont wanna
overlapping annie reacting what what i dont
its not natural
were sleeping in a bed together
you know its been a long time
i know well its just that you know i mean i i i i gotta sing tomorrow night so i have to rest my voice
overlapping annie again its always some kind of an excuse
its you know you used to think that i was very sexy
when we first started going out we had sex constantly
were were probably listed in the guinness book of world records
patting alvys band solicitously i know
well alvy itll pass itll pass its just that im going through a phase thats all
i mean youve been married before you know how things can get
you were very hot for allison at first
allison clipboard in band walks about the wings stopping to talk to various people
musicians performers and technicians mill about busy with activity
allison wears a large adlai button as do the people around her
the sounds of a comedian on the stage of the auditorium can be heard occasionally interrupted by chatter and applause from the off screen audience
allison stops to talk to two women they too wear adlai buttons
looking down at the clipboard maam youre on right after this man
about twenty minutes something like that
oh thank you
alvy moves into the frame behind allison
he taps her on the shoulder she turns to face him
excuse me when do i go on
looking down at the clipboard who are you
im a comedian
youre on next
rubbing his hands together nervously what do you mean next
i mean youre on right after this act
gesturing no it cant be because hes a comic
so what are you telling me youre putting on two comics in a row
no im sorry im not goin i cant i dont wanna go on after that comedian
no because theyre theyre laughing so he starts laughing nervously i i id rather not
if you dont mind i prefer overlapping will you relax please
theyre gonna love you i know
overlapping i prefer not to because
look theyre laughing at him
see so what are yuh telling me they move closer to the stage looking out from the wings
overlapping that ive got to
theyre gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes then i gotta go out there i gotta
get laughs too
how much can they laugh
off screen they they theyre laughed out
off screen do you feel all right
as allison and alvy look out at the stage the camera cuts to their point of view a comedian standing at a podium in front of huge waving pictures of
the audience laughing and clapping sits at round tables in clusters around the room
the camera moves back to allison and alvy watching the stage
alvy is swinging his hands nervously
off screen onstage you know
alvy starts looking allison up and down people in the background mill about
above the chatter around him look whats your whats your name
off screen general eisenhower is not
looking out at the stage allison
still looking off screen portchnik
a group from the
coughing thank you
i i dont know why they would have me at this kind of rally cause
he clears his throat excuse me im not essentially a political comedian at all
the audience starts to laugh
interestingly had uh dated
a woman in the eisenhower administration briefly
and uh it was ironic to me cause uh
cause i was trying to u u uh do to her what eisenhower has been doing to the country for the last eight years
the audience is with him laughing as allison continues to watch offstage
allison and alvy are on the bed kissing
there are books all over the room a fireplace unlit along one of the walls
alvy suddenly breaks away and sits on the edge of the bed
allison looks at him
hm im sorry i cant go through with this because it i cant get it off my mind allison
its obsessing me
well im getting tired of it
i need your attention
alvy gets up from the bed and starts walking restlessly around the room gesturing with his hands
it but it it
doesnt make any sense
he drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound
so how is it possible for oswald to have fired from two angles at once
it doesnt make sense
alvy stopping for a moment at the fireplace mantel sighs
he then snaps his fingers and starts walking again
ill tell you this
he was not marksman enough to hit a moving target at that range
clears his throat if there was a second assassin
it thats it
alvy stops at the music stand with open sheet music on it as allison gets up from the bed and retrieves a pack of cigarettes from a bookshelf
weve been through this
if they they recovered the shells from that rifle
moving back to the bed and lighting a cigarette okay
all right so whatta yuh saying now
that e e everybody o o on the warren commission is in on this conspiracy right
well why not
yeah earl warren
moving toward the bed hey
honey i dont know earl warren
propping one knee on the bed and gesturing l l lyndon johns lyndon johnson is a politician
you know the ethics those guys have
its like uh a notch underneath child molester
then everybodys in in the conspiracy
nodding his head tsch
the fbi and the cia and j
edgar hoover and oil companies and the pentagon and the mens room attendant at the white house
alvy touches allisons shoulder then gets up from the bed and starts walking again
i i i i would leave out the mens room attendant
youre using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me
oh my god
then to the camera shes right
why did i turn off allison portchnik
she was she was beautiful
she was willing
she was real
sighing is it the old groucho marx joke
that that i i just dont wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member
alvys and annies voices are heard over the wind browned exterior of a beach house in the hamptons
as they continue to talk the camera moves inside the house
alvy is picking up chairs trying to get at the group of lobsters crawling on the floor
dishes are stacked up in a drying rack and bags of groceries sit on the counter
theres a table and chairs near the refrigerator
alvy now dont panic
look i told you it was a
mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house
dont do that
the lobsters continue to crawl on the floor
annie bolding out a wooden paddle tries to shove them onto it
well maybe we should just call the police
dial nine one one its the lobster squad
come on alvy theyre only baby ones for gods sake
if theyre only babies then you pick em up
oh all right
its all right
she drops the paddle and picks up one of the lobsters by the tail
laughing she shoves it at alvy who jerks backward squeamishly
dont give it to me
look one crawled behind the refrigerator
itll turn up in our bed at night
they move over to the refrigerator alvy moves as close to the wall as possible as annie covering her mouth and laughing hysterically teasingly dangles a lobster in front of
him will you get outta here with that thing
laughing to the lobster get him
laughing talk to him
you speak shellfish
he moves over to the stove and takes the lid of a large steamer filled with boiling water hey look
put it in the pot
laughing i cant
i cant put him in the pot
i cant put a live thing in hot water
let me do it
what whats he think were gonna do take him to the movies
annie hands the lobster to alvy as he takes it very carefully and drops it gingerly into the pot and puts the cover back on
overlapping alvy and making sounds oh god
here yuh go
oh good now hell think she screams aaaah
overlapping annie okay its in
its definitely in the pot
she moves hurriedly across the kitchen and picks up another lobster
smiling she places it on the counter as alvy stands beside the refrigerator trying to push it from the wall
annie theres a big lobster behind the refrigerator
i cant get it out
this things heavy
maybe if i put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker it will run out the other side you know what i mean
im gonna get my
im gonna get my camera
you know i i think
if i could pry this door off
we shoulda gotten steaks cause they dont have legs
they dont run around
annie rushes out of the room to get her camera as alvy picks up the paddle
trying to get at the lobsters he ends up knocking over dishes and hitting the chandelier
holding the paddle he finally leans back against the sink
annie standing in the doorway starts taking pictures of him
p p p pick this lobster up
hold it please
whatta yuh mean
are yuh gonna take pictures now
itll make great alvy be alvy itll be wonderful
picking up the lobster annie placed on the counter earlier all right here
oh god its disgusting
alvy drops the lobster back down on the counter sticking out his tongue and making a face
dont be a jerk
one more alvy please one more picture
reluctantly alvy picks up the lobster again as annie takes another picture oh oh good good
the camera pans annie and alvy as they walk along the shore
so so well heres what i wanna know
he clears his throat am i your first big romance
no no no no uh uh
well then w who was
oh well lets see there was dennis from chippewa falls high school
behind him is a movie theater with marilyn monroe misfits on the marquee
he looks at his watch as the younger annie in a beehive hairdo moves into the frame
they kiss quickly and look at each other smiling
off screen dennis right uh uh
local kid probably would meetcha in front of the movie house on saturday night
oh god you shouldve seen what i looked like then
off screen laughing oh i can imagine
p p probably the wife of an astronaut
then there was jerry the actor
the younger annie and jerry lean against the wall
jerry is running his band down annies bare arm
annie and alvy walk into the room observing the younger annie in jeans and t shirt with jerry
laughing look at you you you re such a clown
i look pretty
well yeah you always look pretty but that guy with you
acting is like an exploration of the soul
i its very religious
uh like uh a kind of liberating consciousness
its like a visual poem
laughing is he kidding with that crap
laughing oh right
right yeah i think i know exactly what you mean when you say religious
incredulous to annie you do
still watching oh come on i mean i was still younger
hey that was last year
its like when i think of dying
you know how i would like to die
id like to get torn apart by wild animals
eaten by some squirrels
hey listen i mean he was a terrific actor and look at him hes neat looking and he was emotional
y hey i dont think you like emotion too much
jerry stops rubbing the younger annies arm and slides down to the floor as she raises her foot toward his chest
touch my heart
with your foot
i i may throw up
its now sunset the water reflecting the last light
the camera moves over the scene
the off screen voices of alvy and annie are heard as they walk the camera always one step ahead of them
he was creepy
yeah i i think youre pretty lucky i came along
laughing oh really
well la de da
la de da
if i if anyone had ever told me that i would be taking out a girl who used expressions like la de da
oh thats right
that you really like those new york girls
not just not only
oh id say so
you married a cocktail party is in progress the rooms crowded with guests as alvy and robin make their way through the people
a waiter carrying a tray walks past them
alvy reaches out to pick up a glass robin reaches over and picks it of the tray first
there is much low key chatter in the background
off screen two of them
theres henry drucker
he has a chair in history at princeton
oh the short man is hershel kaminsky
he has a chair in philosophy at cornell
yeah two more chairs and they got a dining room set
why are you so hostile
sighing cause i wanna watch the knicks on television
squinting is that paul goodman
and be nice to the host because hes publishing my book
a foul rag and bone shop of the heart
they move through the rooms robin holding a drink in one hand her arm draped in alvys the crowd mills around them
taking robins hand im so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for dysentery
oh really i heard that commentary and dissent had merged and formed dysentery
no jokes these are friends okay
alvy sits on the foot of the bed watching the knicks game on television
off screen cleveland cavaliers losing to the new york knicks
robin enters the room slamming the door
here you are
theres people out there
hey you wouldnt believe this
two minutes ago the knicks are ahead fourteen points and now
clears his throat theyre ahead two points
alvy what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop
looking at robin whats fascinating is that its physical
you know its one thing about intellectuals they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea whats going on
but on the other hand
clears his throat the body doesnt lie as as we now know
alvy reaches over pulls robin down onto the bed
he kisses her and moves farther up on the bed
stop acting out
she sits on the edge of the bed looking down at the sprawled out alvy
no itll be great
itll be great be because all those ph
s are in there you know like
discussing models of alienation and well be in here quietly humping
he pulls robin toward him caressing her as she pulls herself away
youre using sex to express hostility
why why do you always r reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories
clears his throat he said as he removed her brassiere
pulling away again there are people out there from the new yorker magazine

those are the two categories
you know theyre the the horrible would be like uh i dont know terminal cases you know
and blind people crippled
i dont dont know how they get through life
its amazing to me
you know and the miserable is everyone else
thats thats all
so so when you go through life you should be thankful that youre miserable because thats youre very lucky
overlapping annies laughter to be miserable
its a beautiful sunny day in central park
people are sitting on benches others strolling some walking dogs
one woman stands feeding cooing pigeons
alvys and annies voices are heard off screen as they observe the scene before them

annie reacting tosses the suitcases and some loose clothing onto the bed
she sits down on the edge looking away
alvy walks in pictures and carton in band still talking rapidly growing field
you dont want me to live with you

how whose idea was it
it was yours actually but uh i approved it immediately
i guess you think that i talked you into something huh
putting pictures on the mantel no what what
we live together we sleep together we eat together
jesus you dont want it to be like were married do yuh
he moves over to the carton of books on the window seat and reaches in
he starts tossing books off screen
looking up at alvy how is it any different
gesturing its different cause you keep your own apartment
holding a book he starts walking around the room because you know its there we dont have to go to it we dont have to deal with it but its
like a a a free floating life raft
that we know that were not married
he tosses the book on the bed and walks back to the window seat
still sitting on the bed that little apartment is four hundred dollars a month alvy
looking at annie that place is four hundred dollars a month
yes it is
whistling its its got bad plumbing and bugs
jesus ill my accountant will write it off as a tax deduction ill pay for it
shaking her head you dont think im smart enough to be serious about

alvy moves over to the bed and sits down next to annie
then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like i was dumb or something
putting his hand to his forehead cause adult educations a wonderful thing
you meet a lotta interesting professors
you know its stimulating
annie and alvy in annies vw driving to their summerhouse
the camera moves with them as they pass a house with a lighted window blooming foliage
there is no dialogue but it is a comfortable quiet
classical music plays in the background
annie sitting cross legged on a wooden chest in the bedroom is browsing through a school catalogue
alvy lies in bed reading
reading does this sound like a good course
uh modern american poetry
uh or uh lets see now
maybe i should uh take introduction to the novel
just dont take any course where they make you read beowulf
laughing hey listen what what do you think
do you think we should uh go to that that party in southampton tonight
alvy leans over and kisses her shoulder
no dont be silly

he puts his arms around her neck kissing her annie making muffled sounds you know we should we should just turn out the lights you know and play hide and
seek or something
laughing well okay

yelling out to her as she leaves the room yeah grass right
the illusion that it will make a white woman more like billie holiday
off screen well have you ever made love high
i i you know if i have grass or alcohol or anything i get unbearably wonderful
i get too too wonderful for words
you know i dont i dont know why you have to uh get high every time we make love

oh come on look whos talking

he undresses and crawls into bed taking annie in his arms mmmm

as annie speaks her inner self ghostlike moves up from the bed and sits down on a chair watching
i dont know but you seem sort of distant
lets just do it all right
kissing and caressing annie is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions
alvy do you remember where i put my drawing pad

the camera shows a neat two story house surrounded by a well manicured green lawn then cuts to alvy and the halls are eating easter dinner
the sun is pouring through a big picture window shining on a large elegantly laid out table
alvy sits at one end rubbing his nose and chewing the halls flanking him on either side mr
hall grammy and annies brother duane
holding her wine glass its a nice ham this year mom
grammy hall takes a sip of her wine and nods
smiling at duane oh yeah
grammy always does such a good job
chewing a great sauce

grammy hall stares down the table at alvy a look of utter dislike
alvy tries not to notice
to dad hall smoothing her hair we went over to the swap meet
annie gram and i
got some nice picture frames
we really had a good time
grammy continues to stare at alvy he is now dressed in the long black coat and hat of the orthodox jew complete with mustache and heard
lighting a cigarette and turning to alvy ann tells us that youve been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years
setting down his glass and coughing yes
im making excellent progress
pretty soon when i lie down on his couch i wont have to wear the lobster bib
mom hall reacts by sipping from her glass and frowning
grammy continues to stare
duane and i went out to the boat basin
we were caulkin holes all day

alvy leaning his elbow on the table looks out toward the camera
to the audience i cant believe this family

the screen splits in half on the right is alvys family his mother father aunt and uncle busily eating at the crowded kitchen table

on the left the halls in their dining room
both dialogues overlap juxtaposed
let im drop dead
who needs his business

alvy sighs and sits down leaning his arm on duanes dresser
duanes face is big lighted by a single lamp
i tell you this because as an artist i think youll understand
sometimes when im driving
on the road at night i see two headlights coming toward me
i have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly head on into the oncoming car
i can anticipate the explosion
the sound of shattering glass
flames rising out of the flowing gasoline
reacting and clearing his throat right
tsch well i have to i have t o go now duane because i im due back on the planet earth
he slowly gets up and moves toward the door

duane behind the wheel stares straight ahead
it is raining very hard the windshield wipers are moving quickly
the headlights of another car brightens the interior of duanes car as the camera shows first duane then annie then alvy tensely staring straight ahead
the camera bolds on a quiet new york city street the buildings brownstones
its a warm day people sit on front stoops window boxes are planted
annie walks into the frame first then alvy who is walking to her right
they walk quickly side by side their voices heard before they move into the frame
off screen you followed me
i cant believe it
off screen i didnt follow you
you followed me
was walkin along a block behind you staring at you
thats not following
well what is your definition of following
gasping following is different
i was spying
do you realize how paranoid you are
im looking at you
you got your arms around another guy
that is the worst kind of paranoia
yeah well i didnt start out spying
i i thought id surprise yuh
pick you up after school
yeah well you wanted to keep the relationship flexible remember
its your phrase
oh stop it
but you were having an affair with your college professor
that jerk that teaches that incredible crap course contemporary crisis in western man
existential motifs in russian literature
youre really close
whats the difference
its all mental masturbation
stopping for a moment oh well now were finally getting to a subject you know something about
she walks away
catching up to her hey dont knock masturbation
its sex with someone i love
continuing to walk quickly were not having an affair
he just happens to think im neat
still walking next to her neat
theres that what are you twelve years old
thats one o your chippewa falls expressions
he thinks im neat
next thing you know hell find you keen and peachy you know
next thing you know hes got his hand on your ass
they both stop in the middle of the street
youve always had hostility toward david ever since i mentioned him
you call your teacher david
its his name
well listen thats a nice bi its a biblical name
w what does he call you
he walks away
calling after him alvy
youre the one who never wanted to make a real commitment
you dont think im smart enough
we had that argument just last month or dont ou remember that day
alvy is at the sink washing dishes as the screen cuts to the scene of last months argument
annies voice is heard
off screen im home
turning oh yeah
howd it go
comes into the kitchen and puts down a bag of groceries on the kitchen table oh it was
laughing really weird
but shes a very nice woman
and i didnt have to lie down on the couch alvy she had me sitting up
so i told her about about the the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother
and then she mentioned penis envy
did you know about that
im im one of the few males who suffers from that so so
g go on im interested
well she said that i was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage and and children
and then i remembered when i was a kid how i accidentally saw my parents making love
rea all this happened in the first hour
i i i
ive been goin for fifteen years i you know i dont got
nothing like that in oh i told her my dream and then i cried
ive never once cried
taking groceries from the bag yeah
i i i sit and i whine
alvy in my dream frank sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and i cant breathe
yeah and hes strangling me
and i keep you know its taking a bottle of juice and some celery from the bag well well sure
because hes a singer and youre a singer you know so its perfect
so youre trying to suffocate yourself
it it makes perfect sense
uh uh thats a perfect analytic kind of insight
pointing her finger at alvy she said your name was alvy singer
turning to annie whatta you mean
yeah yeah yeah you
because in the dream
i break sinatras glasses
putting his band to his mouth sinatra had gl you never said sinatra had glasses
so whatta you saying that i im suffocating you
turning ajar in her hand oh and god alvy i did
this really terrible thing to him
because then when he sang it was in this real high pitched voice
thinking tsch whatd the doctor say
putting away some groceries well she said that i should probably come five times a week
and you know something
i dont think i mind analysis at all
the only question is will it change my wife
will it change your wife
will it change my life
yeah but you said will it change my wife
no i didnt
laughing i said will it change my life alvy
you said will it change
will it change
yelling out angry life
i said life
alvy turns toward the camera
to the audience she said will it change my wife
you heard that because you were there so im not crazy
and then i told her about how i didnt think youd ever really take me seriously because you dont think that im smart enough
she walks out of the room
to annies back gesturing why do you always bring that up
because i encourage you to take adult education courses
i think its a wonderful thing
you meet wonderful interesting professors
annie stands at the open door of a cab alvy next to her gesturing as people and cars move by
adult education is such junk
the professors are so phony
how can you do it
a bit rapidly
i dont care what you say about david hes a perfectly fine teacher
i cant believe this
and what are you doing following me around for anyway
im following you and david if you interrupting i just think we oughta call this relationship quits
annie gets into the cab alvy leans over and closes the door
he turns toward the camera as the cab drives away well i dont know what i did wrong
gesturing i mean i cant believe this
somewhere she cooled off to me
he walks up to an older woman walking down the street carrying groceries is it is it something that i did
never something you do
thats how people are
she moves on down the street
scratching his head love fades
god thats a depressing thought
have to ask you a question
he stops another passer by a man dont go any further
now with your wife in bed d d does she need some kind o artificial stimulation like like marijuana
we use a large vibrating egg
he walks on
continuing to walk large vibrating egg
well i ask a psychopath i get that kind of an answer
jesus i i uh here
he moves up the sidewalk to a young trendy looking couple arms wrapped around each other you you look like a really happy couple
so h h how do you account for it
uh im very shallow and empty and i have no ideas and nothing interesting to say
and im exactly the same way
well thats very interesting
so youve managed to work out something huh
oh well thanks very much for talking to me
he continues to walk past some other passersby and moves into the street
a mounted policeman comes by and stops near him
alvy looks at the horse as if to speak
you know even as a kid i always went for the wrong women
i think thats my problem
when my mother took me to see snow white everyone fell in love with snow white
i immediately fell for the wicked queen
the scene dissolves into a sequence from the animated snow white and the seven dwarfs
the wicked queen resembling annie sits in the palace before her mirror
alvy as a cartoon figure sits beside her arms crossed in front of him
we never have any fun anymore
how can you say that
youre always leaning on me to improve myself
youre just upset
you must be getting your period
i dont get a period
im a cartoon character
cant i be upset once in a while
rob as a cartoon figure enters and sits down on the other side of the wicked queen
max will you forget about annie
i know lots of women you can date
i dont wanna go out with any other women
max have i got a girl for you
you are going to love her
shes a reporter the cartoon figures of alvy and rob walk past the wicked queen the screen dissolves into the interior of a concert ball
robs voice carries over from the cartoon scene as the screen shows alvy with the female reporter
its very crowded noisy policeman and reporters are everywhere
alvy stands with his hands in his pockets watching the commotion
for rolling stone
i think there are more people here to see the maharishi than there were to see the dylan concert
i covered the dylan concert
which gave me chills
especially when he sang she takes just like a woman and she makes love just like a woman yes she does and she aches just like a woman but she
breaks just like a little girl
they move toward the aisles as a guard holds up his hands to stop them up to that i guess the most charismatic event i covered was micks birthday when
the stones played madison square garden
laughing man thats great
thats just great
you catch dylan
i i couldnt make it that ni my my raccoon had hepatitis
you have a raccoon
gesturing tsch a few
the only word for this is trans plendid
its trans plendid
i can think of another word
i mean this man is god
hes got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment
it must be a tremendous hem
im a rosicrucian myself
i cant get with any religion that advertises in popular mechanics
look the maharisbi a small chunky man walks out of the mens room huge bodyguards flanking him while policemen bold back the crowds theres god coming outta the mens room
its unbelievably trans plendid
i was at the stones concert in altamount when they killed that guy remember
yeah were yuh

the reporter is sitting up in bed lighted cigarette in her hand

sighing oh no no dont be

you know yawning im startin it im startin to get some feeling back in my jaw now
oh sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience
oh tsch thank you

making sounds i think i think theres too much burden placed on the orgasm you know to make up for empty areas in life
who said that
rubbing his chin and shoulder uh oh i dont know
it might have been leopold and loeb
the telephone rings
alvy picks it up rising up slightly from the bed concerned as he talks hello

the screen is projecting the beginning of the sorrow and the pity a street filled with fleeing cars belongings tied on top and piled in the back seats
subtitles pop on the jewish warmongers and parisian plutocrats tried to flee with their gold and jewels as a narrator explains in german
split screen annie and her psychiatrist on the left alvy and his on the right
annie talking sits in a white molded chair as does her doctor
the office is very modern stark white and chrome
alvy talking to his psychiatrist lies on a deep leather sofa the doctor seated away from him
this office looks more like a well worn den bookcases overflowing dark wood
the dialogue is separated in each screen though no one talks simultaneously
to her doctor that day in brooklyn was the last day i remember really having a great time
to his doctor well we never have any laughs anymore is the problem
well ive been moody and dissatisfied
how often do you sleep together

i tried everything you know i i i put on soft music and my my red light bulb and
but the thing is i mean since our discussions here i feel i have a right to my own feelings

the incredible thing about it is im paying for her analysis and shes making progress and im getting screwed
i dont know though i feel so guilty because alvy is paying for it so you know so i do feel guilty if i dont go to bed with him
but if i do go to bed with him its like im going against my own feelings
i dont know i i cant win

they pass a man talking on the phone in the hallway
i forgot my mantra
as they come down stairs the party is still in big gear
people are looser now conversations are more animated some talk quietly in more intimate corners some couples are dancing
alvy stands alone sipping a drink near the huge christmas tree
a tall woman passing by shakes his hand then leaves
he continues to sip his drink alone watching tony and annie in the center of the room dancing
the screen shows a plane in flight los angeles far below then annie and alvy sit the stewardess behind them serving other passengers
annie stares out the window bolding a coffee cup alvy reads
both are preoccupied thinking their own thoughts
to herself that was fun
i dont think california is bad at all
its a drag coming home
to himself lotta beautiful women
it was fun to flirt
as she sips coffee i have to face facts
i i adore alvy but our relationship doesnt seem to work anymore
an open magazine lies in his lap ill have the usual trouble with annie in bed tonight
whatta i need this
if only i had the nerve to break up but it would really hurt him
if only i didnt feel guilty asking annie to move out
itd probably wreck her
but i should be honest
he looks over at annie
looking back at alvy alvy uh lets face it
you know something dont think our relationship is working
tsch i know
a relationship i think is is like a shark you know
it has to constantly move forward or it dies
he sighs and i think what we got on our hands clearing his throat is a dead shark
a lighted christmas tree stands in the middle of boxes books and the general disarray of packing and figuring out what belongs to whom as alvy helps annie move out
holding up a book whose catcher in the rye is this
walking into the room with an armload of books well lets see now
if it has my name on it then i guess its mine
reacting oh it sure has
you know you wrote your name in all my books cause you knew this day was gonna come
putting down the books and flipping back her hair well uh alvy you wanted to break up just as much as i do
riffling through the books theres no no question in my mind
i think were doing the mature thing without any doubt
holding a framed picture and moving about now look all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine
looking down at a book this denial of death
you remember this
oh this is the first book that i got you
annie goes over to alvy
they both look down at the book the fireplace burning nicely is behind them
remember that day
geez i feel like theres a great weight off my back
patting alvys shoulder oh no no no no no
i mean you know no no no i mean i think its really important for us to explore new relationships and stuff like that
she walks away
theres no theres no question about that cause weve given this
uh uh i think a more than fair shot you know
he tosses the book into the carton
off screen yeah my analyst thinks this move is keen for me
off screen yeah and i i tru you know i trust her because my my analyst recommended her
walking in with another armload of books well why should i put you through all my moods and hang ups anyway
and you and you know what the beauty part is
holding a small box of buttons we can always come back together again

taking a button from a box hey this ones mine this button

impeach uh eisenhower

people milling about on the sidewalk as alvy walks out of a store and moves toward the foreground
into the camera to the audience i miss annie
i made a terrible mistake
a couple walking down the street stops as the man talks to alvy
shes living in los angeles with tony lacey
well if she is then the hell with her
if she likes that lifestyle let her live there
hes a jerk for one thing

i found this in the apartment
she used to wash her face eight hundred times a day with black soap

well i i tried but its uh you know its very depressing
alvys arms and legs fill the screen as he slowly gets up from the floor bolding up a live lobster
he puts it on a grill tray
pointing to the lobster this always happens to me
quick g go get a broom
his date a girl wearing short shorts leans against the sink and lights a cigarette
she makes no move to help
smoking what are you making such a big deal about
as she talks the lobster drops from the tray to the floor
alvy jumps away then gingerly scrapes the tray toward the lobster theyre only lobsters
look youre a grown man you know how to pick up a lobster

a waitress brings alvy a menu and waits for his order

annie gets into her car

i cant believe it
greatest greatest fascist dictator adolf hitler
annie drives away
alvy gets behind the wheel starts the motor
putting the car in gear he inadvertently moves forward hitting a bunch of trash cans with a loud crash
putting the car in reverse alvy notices a beige car that has just turned into the parking lot
for a brief moment the screen shows a flashback of the bumper car ride at the brooklyn amusement park
alvys father is on the platform directing traffic young alvy is in a small car bumping others right and left
alvy hack in the parking lot backs up his convertible purposefully smashing the side of the beige car as another flashback of bumper car ride appears this time as alvys
father directs traffic a marine in a small car bits the back end of a soldiers car and alvy back in the parking lot moves his car over to another parked car and bits it full force
another flashback appears
people in the small cars really racing around the track now bumping into one another over and over again alvys father directing the flow as the film cuts back to
the parking lot where alvy reverses the convertible and rams it into the front end of yet another car
he sits behind the wheel as people rush out of various cars and as sirens start blaring coming closer and closer stopping finally as a motorcycle cop gets off beside
alvys car and walks over to him
getting out of the car officer i know what youre gonna say

a guard moves down the ball to the cell where alvy stands with other inmates
he unlocks the door and opens it letting alvy out

you you read death in venice
you didnt read death in venice till i gave it to you
well you only give me books with the word death in the title
the camera pulls back showing alvy sitting with two men at a table set up near the actors
a mirror running the whole width of the wall reflects the two actors a script lying on the table between them
it is obvious now that they are rehearsing a scene that alvy wrote
in mirrored reflection its an important issue
in mirrored reflection alvy you are totally incapable of enjoying life
the camera moves back to actual actor and actress
youre like new york
youre an island
rising with emotion okay if thats all that weve been through together means to you i guess its better if we just said goodbye once and for all
you know its funny after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here
in a health food restaurant on sunset boulevard
the actor begins to leave as the actress jumps up from her chair
im im gonna
go with you
the actor comes back
they embrace i love you
the camera cuts to alvy who turns and looks straight into the camera
to the audience gesturing tsch whatta you want
it was my first play
you know you know how youre always tryin t get things to come out perfect in art because uh its real difficult in life
interestingly however i did run into annie again
it was on the upper west side of manhattan
annie singing seems like old times overlaps alvys speech and continues over the next scene where alvy standing in front of a manhattan theater shakes hands with annie and her
the theater marquee reads ophuls over the theater scene and annies singing she had moved back to new york
she was living in soho with some guy
laughing and when i met her she was of all things dragging him in to see the sorrow and the pity
which i counted as a personal triumph
annie and i
alvys voice continues over the scene shot through a window of manhattan cafe showing alvy and annie sitting at a table laughing and enjoying themselves we had lunch sometime after
that and uh just uh kicked around old times
a series of flashbacks following in quick succession while annie continues to sing annie and alvy going up the fdr drive the day they met playing tennis annie driving alvy
bolding up partially eaten sandwich
annie and alvy in the hamptons house kitchen annie banding a live lobster to alvy who drops it in the pot on the stove
annie and alvy walking side by side by the shoreline
alvy at the tennis club packing his bag as he looks over his shoulder and sees annie hands on her face then clapping as she offers him a ride home
in her car
annie opening the door to alvy the night he came over to kill the spider annie and alvy in the bookstore buying the death titles annie and alvy in their
hamptons house annie reading a school catalogue the night alvy puts in the red light
the memories continue to flash on the screen annie and alvy at a friends house alvy blowing the cocaine all over the sofa annie and alvy playing tennis annie and
alvy having a picture taken backstage at the college performance in annies hometown alvy bolding annie close the night he came over to kill the spider
and continue annie carrying her luggage and clothes into alvys bedroom alvy following the day she first moved into his apartment
annie holding up her sexy birthday present from alvy then leaning over and kissing him annie and alvy walking down a city street holding each other close sitting on the
park bench observing the people and kissing on the fdr drive the new york city skyline behind them
the music stops
returning to the present the camera focusing through the cafe window shows annie and alvy across street
they look about at the city traffic
lunch is over its time
alvy and annie shake hands and kiss each other friendly like
annie crosses the street alvy watching her go
then he turns and slowly walks down the street off screen
his voice is heard over the scene after that it got pretty late
and we both hadda go but it was great seeing annie again right
i realized what a terrific person she was and and how much fun it was just knowing her and i i thought of that old joke you know this this
this guy goes to a psychiatrist and says doc uh my brothers crazy
he thinks hes a chicken
and uh the doctor says well why dont you turn him in
and the guy says i would but i need the eggs
well i guess thats pretty much how how i feet about relationships
you know theyre totally irrational and crazy and absurd and
but uh i guess we keep goin through it because uh most of us need the eggs
credits popping on and off in white
