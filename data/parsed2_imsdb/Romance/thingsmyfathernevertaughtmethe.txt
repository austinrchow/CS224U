written by burleigh smith albert a middle aged man feeds melvin a two year old
i loved my father and he taught me many useful things
but he didnt teach me anything at all about women
there was a time when i resented that
and then one day it occurred to me that perhaps he didnt know all that much about the fairer sex
on the other side of the room corinne a vulgar morbidly obese woman sits on the couch and devours a large packet of potato chips
one look at my mother and i had conclusive proof
she burps loudly and gives a smile of satisfaction
melvin now thirty two walks along with mike three
both are bespectacled
heres what im going to do son
ill give it to you straight
im not going to fill your head with stories about fictitious characters like santa claus or the easter bunny or god
theres only one thing you need to worry about in this life and thats women
and im going to teach you everything i know about the art of meeting courting and seducing em
dont worry about anything else theres nothing more important
reading writing toilet training you can learn later in life
mike wearing cute denim overalls with a teddy bear embroidered on the front stands on a footstool in front of melvin and a tailor
clothes maketh or unmaketh the man
what were you thinking when you put that on this morning
that you were going to spend the day in the sandpit
mike responds with a look of innocence and confusion
to tailor well take the best youve got
to mike the finer the threads the more inclined the ladies will be to tear them off
i know dont try to make sense of their logic
they have none
melvin at a table with mike who is now dressed in smart casual attire and looks more like his father
of course its not all about clothes
its the way you carry yourself too
youve gotta make a conscious effort to be relaxed but in control in all situations
and a little playful
go for an expression where youre suppressing mild amusement
but dont overdo it
you want to look dignified at all times
melvin glances over to mike who is picking his nose
are you not listening to a word i say
mike freezes unsure what to do his finger still planted in his nostril
melvin yanks it out
melvin and mike approach the entrance
now meeting the right person is really all about spending enough time in the right places
so were going to a new preschool today
one in a higher socioeconomic suburb
melvin and mike sit on a bench and watch children at play
mike looks around then points
you like the girl over there
shes molly three
a shy bespectacled girl she sits on her own and reads a book
i think theres enough geek genes in our family
its time to diversify
elsewhere brittany four is taunting another child
and avoid that bitchy girl
she may be pretty but believe me its not worth the trouble
you definitely dont want to get involved with someone like your mother
melvin keeps looking
he points out amelie three well dressed and eating a baguette
stay away from the french girl too
french women have no morals
it might be great for a bit of slap and tickle after midnight when the only meat your buddies are getting is at a kebab shop
but theres no word in french for fidelity and what were looking for is a serious relationship
i mean what youre looking for
awkwardly unconvincing im fine
sarah three blonde and dressed in pink sits at a table nearby
she talks excitedly with a group of girls
shes popular good looking
she seems friendly enough
i think barbie there might be worth a try
mike doesnt look so sure
go and talk to her
intimidated mike shakes his head his eyes pleading
its better to get shot down than wonder what if
melvin gives him a push in sarahs direction
just show an interest in the things that interest her and youll have plenty to talk about
mike looking completely out of place in his flashy clothes apprehensively approaches the girls
they stop talking and watch him
he picks up sarahs handbag and admires it putting it over his shoulder
then he tries on her sun hat and slips into her discarded pink shoes
the girls laugh at him and run away
melvin covers his face in disbelief
back on the bench melvin scolds mike
would you like to go to the toyshop later on
you can pick out a nice fairy costume
what are you doing to me boy
mike shrugs defensively
we need to toughen up your image now
most girls are attracted to bad boys
see if you can start some sort of altercation with her
mike thinks then nods his head
mike grabs a handful of sand from the sandpit marches up to sarah and throws it forcefully into her face
sarah starts to cry drawing the attention of everyone in the playground
mike smiles and looks to his father for approval
melvin is horrified
mike struggles with a large arrangement of flowers
melvin pays the florist
well that was over the top but at least you got her attention
and its better to be known as a jerk rather than a fruitcake
the good news is you now have the opportunity to apologise
if you can feign sincerity and a desperation for forgiveness you should be able to endear yourself to her
to florist leave the price tag on
we want her to know how much we paid
melvin watches from the other side of the high fence
mike carries the flowers across the playground
he sees sarah being comforted by her friends
then he sees molly who is still reading her book
melvin gestures for mike to give the flowers to sarah
mike thinks then gives them to molly instead
melvin groans and throws his hands up in frustration
melvin points his finger in mikes face
im trying to do the right thing by you and you mess everything up
youre as incompetent as
the government film funding bodies
mary early thirties and attractive approaches with molly who carries the flowers
molly loves her flowers
melvins attitude changes immediately
they were my idea
well it was a very nice gesture
she continues walking then stops
were going to lunch at the cafe on the corner
would you and mike like to join us
well see you there
mary and molly leave
melvin turns back to mike
great work my friend
looks like were in for a double date
he claps a high five with his son
and the perfect chance for you to learn from a master at work
melvin mike mary and molly sit around a table
before eating mary and molly bow their heads in prayer
mike watches them and does the same
unseen by the others melvin decides to give thanks too
and not for the food in front of him
melvin and mary sit and watch their children laugh as they chase each other about
they seem to like each other
they certainly do
molly has a birthday party coming up
would you like to come
im thinking about a sleepover
or is it too soon
she smiles at him
melvin raises an eyebrow seductively
a sleepover would be great
no such thing as too soon when youre with the right person
he moves closer to mary
he puts one hand on her leg and uses the other to play with her hair
she pulls away violently and stands
what are you doing
getting to know you
before the sleepover
i meant mike coming over to spend the night
not his dad
unimpressed she walks over to molly lifts her into her arms and they leave
mike stares coldly at his father his hands on his hips
mike picks flowers from a nearby garden
melvin sits alone dejected
mike approaches and whispers in his ear
its better to get shot down than wonder what if
mike whispers more
i now have the opportunity to apologise and endear myself to her
mike presents his father with a small arrangement of hand picked flowers
yeah youre right
ive taught you well
he takes the flowers leans over and kisses his boy fondly on the head
