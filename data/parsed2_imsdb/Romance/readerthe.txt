written by david hare based on the novel by bernhard schlink
a modern apartment all cool and glass
michael berg is preparing breakfast laying the table for two
he is dark haired saturnine
he is doing everything with deliberate quietness taking the occasional glance towards the bedroom to check hes not making too much noise
he is boiling an egg which he takes out of boiling water and puts on a sparkling clean plate
michael puts the yolk stained egg cup and plate into the sink his breakfast eaten then as noiseless as he can turns on the tap to run water
the bedroom door opens and brigitte comes out naked
shes attractive younger
the credits end
you didnt wake me
you were sleeping
you let me sleep because you cant bear to have breakfast with me
its half serious
michael doesnt react
nothing could be further from the truth
i boiled you an egg
michael produces a second boiled egg in a cup seemingly from nowhere like a magician and puts it on the table
id hardly have boiled you an egg if i didnt want to see you
tea or coffee
brigitte has re appeared from the bedroom now in a dressing gown
shes still half serious
does any woman ever stay long enough to find out what the hell goes on in your head
michael smiles to himself
what are you doing tonight
im seeing my daughter
youve kept very quiet about her
shes been abroad for a year
did you say tea
michael kisses brigitte on the cheek as she departs
give my love to your daughter
he closes the door then turns to the open door of the bedroom
he looks at the mess of last nights love making
then he goes to the window and looks out
a yellow u bahn goes by
michael now is sitting on a tram
he is in a well cut suit hes inherited ill fitting with two tone shoes and tangled mop of hair
sweat breaks out all over his face
a woman is staring at him
hes plainly feeling ill
michael stands at the window looking out
impulsively michael gets up rings the bell and gets off at the next stop
michael closes the window
it has come on to rain
michael is walking along the street looking more and more sickly
there is an archway leading to a courtyard and impulsively he darts inside to get out of the rain
he begins to vomit
opposite him is a wood workshop open to the yard
a uniformed tram conductress walks past
michaels body is turned away his face invisible his hand over his mouth
she puts down her ticket machine on the pavement and seizes him by the arm
hanna schmitz has ash blonde hair and is in her mid thirties
hes sick again
she reappears with a bucket of water to sluice down the pavement
she wipes his face down with a wet cloth
then she fills another bucket
effortlessly hanna takes michael in her arms
she holds his head against her breasts
michael buries himself and slowly he stops sobbing
then he lifts his head
where do you live
hanna and michael walk at a fair pace along a street dotted with the scaffolding of new building
hanna is carrying his satchel she is pulling him by the arm
they come up the road
it is now snowing
michael stops outside his block as if nervous she might come in
ill be fine now
look after yourself
michael smiles thank you and goes in
hanna is left alone
she looks round frowning then sets off stopping uncertainly at the crossroads to check for the way she came
michael turns and watches curious at her indecision
carla berg is at the stove in the kitchen
she takes dinner through for the berg family at a round table in a traditional apartment under a five candled brass chandelier
michaels father peter is a balding abstracted man eating in oppressive silence
next to him his older brother thomas his older sister angela and his younger sister emily
michael has his book in front of him not touching his food
im worried about him
he looks terrible
the boys saying he doesnt need a doctor
i dont need a doctor
carla looks reproachful
were not going to argue about this
people have to take responsibility for their own lives
michael is lying in a single bed his face violently inflamed
carla is with the doctor a much older man
remind me how old are you now
its scarlet fever
hell be in bed for several months
michael turns into the pillow a wet patch beneath his head
delusional with fever he senses a presence at the door
but at once carlas arm pulls her away
the door closes
in the corridor the doctor is heard
burn the sheets
and three months is the minimum
a sunny day in march
michaels bed has been moved beside open windows so he can profit from the weak sun
he is sitting up working on his stamp collection
carla is moving round behind him tidying the room
how are you feeling
by the way i meant to tell you the day i got ill
a woman helped me
a woman in the street
she helped you
she brought me home
do you have her address
michael is standing holding a small bunch of flowers
he is looking puzzled at a row of bells with numbers only
the woodyard is busy
workmen come out of the building
michael comes up the stairwell once grand now in decay green linoleum and faded red paint
the sound of a sentimental song at the open door of a small apartment
inside hanna is ironing in a sleeveless smock blue with red flowers
her hair is fastened in a clip
she looks at him a moment
the flat is without decoration an enfilade of small rooms
a stove a sink a tub a boiler a table a few wooden chairs
there is no window just a balcony door to let light into the room
hanna carries on ironing
i brought you these flowers
to say thank you
put them down there
michael puts them beside the sink
hanna has a blanket and a cloth over the table nothing disturbs her rhythm as she irons one piece of laundry after another then folds it and puts it over
one of the chairs
i would have come earlier but ive been in bed for three months
youre better now
have you always been weak
id never been ill before
its incredibly boring
theres nothing to do
i couldnt even be bothered to read
hanna carries on ironing
he is becoming as comfortable with the silence as she is
she starts ironing a pair of knickers
he watches her bare arms moving back and forth
she looks broad planed strong
she is at peace with being watched
she puts one pair of knickers down then does another
then she upends the iron
i have to go to work
ill walk with you
wait in the hall while i change
michael goes out into the hall
the kitchen door is slightly open
hanna takes off her smock and stands in a green slip
her stockings are hanging over the back of a chair
she picks one up rolls it smooths it up over her calf and knee then attaches it to her suspender
she reaches for the other
the flesh is bare between her legs
michael watches riveted
hanna seems oblivious
but as she is about to put the second stocking on she looks at him
she drops her dress and straightens holding her stare
in response he blushes then panics and runs out of the flat
the door slams
michael runs down the stairs in terror and shame and out the front door
the workmen look up curious as michael flies by slamming the outer door
michael is lying in bed
he looks up at the sound of a tram going by outside
the tram making its way along the quiet street
michael gets out of bed and quickly gets dressed
michael reading a book watches unobserved fascinated as hanna collects tickets
she calls out the name of the next stop
she doesnt see him as she works
michael is standing on the other side of the street from hannas courtyard
he is in two minds about whether to go in
the woodworkers are loading a van
he waits for them to finish before he slips in through the archway making his way to the stairs
michael is sitting on the steps of the first landing
then as if from nowhere hanna is suddenly standing behind him in uniform carrying a box of coal in one hand a scuttle in the other
she looks tired but not surprised to see him
there are two more buckets downstairs
you can fill them and bring them up
hanna walks straight past him
for a moment he tenses as if there might be some contact
but she goes by
michael opens the door
he turns on a dim light
there is a flight of wooden stairs into the murk of a huge pile of coke poured in from the street
he goes down to the bottom and picks up a bucket
he digs in to the coke and at once it comes tumbling down on him in a cloud of dust
hanna is at the kitchen table drinking a glass of milk
she has taken off her jacket and loosened her tie
michael comes in with the two buckets of coal his face and clothes filthy
she roars with laughter full throated
you look ridiculous look at you kid
michael sees himself in the mirror but she has already got up going towards the tub in the corner of the kitchen
you cant go home like that
give me your clothes ill run you a bath
hanna opens the tap
theres a boiler and steaming hot water comes out
michael takes off his sweater then stops
what do you always take a bath in your trousers
hanna takes his sweater and goes to open the balcony door
she puts his sweater on the balcony rail
its all right i wont look
on the contrary she turns and walks straight towards him
michael is naked
hanna takes his clothes from the chair
he gets into the bath
she goes to the balcony
in the bath he submerges himself
hanna goes out and shakes his clothes out in the open air
when he comes up from under the water she is laying his clothes back on the chair
she picks up the shampoo and hands it to him
wash your hair ill get you a towel
michael washes his hair then submerges again
when he comes back up hanna is holding out a large towel
he gets out turning away to hide his erection
from behind she wraps his body and rubs him dry
then she lets the towel fall
she puts her body against his back and he realises shes naked
he turns and faces her
thats why you came back
michael looks at her awed
youre so incredibly beautiful
now kid you know thats not true
at once she puts her arms round him and they kiss
michael goes down onto the floor hanna on top of him
all the time shes staring into his eyes
he cant take it
he closes his eyes and about to come begins to scream
she puts her hand over his mouth to smother the noise
the family is half way through their meal
michael is sitting watching them eat thinking about his lovemaking with hanna
youve inconvenienced your mother
how many more times
ive said im sorry
you scared her
its hardly my fault i got lost thats all
thats why i was late
can i have some more
he reaches for more stew
thomas goes on eating a look of contempt on his face too superior to engage in this
how can anyone get lost in their own home town
the doctor told me i had to take walks
i meant to head for the castle i ended up at the sports field
theyre in opposite directions
its none of your business
hes not lying
michael never lies
carla smiles benignly
emily knows shes right
they all eat on for a few moments
dad ive decided i want to go back to school tomorrow
the doctor says you need another three weeks
well im going
if he wants to go back then he must
michael cant breathe as if some decisive moment in his life has been reached
peter is looking at him seeming to know whats going on
a massive brownstone building
the whole school is coming out but michael is first in a desperate hurry waving goodbye to his friends and running quickly away
michael comes quickly up the stairs
the door of hannas apartment is ajar
he pushes it open
hanna is at the sink
michael comes in precipitate tearing off his clothes and embracing her at the same time
he drops his trousers and lifts her onto the sink
he comes in about twenty seconds
he stands sweating
all right kid its not just about you
they are on the bed
he is lying underneath her
hanna leads his hands to her face then down her body
she begins to move and in response he moves too
he watches awed as she comes
hanna has fallen asleep on michaels chest
he is awake looking at the birthmark on her left shoulder
the sound of the wood yard below
he kisses the birthmark
whats your name
she opens her eyes
a look of suspicion
why do you want to know
ive been here three times
you havent told me your name
michael waits a moment
whats yours kid
so im with a michael
hanna smiles as if there were something funny about it
a teacher in his sixties has scrawled the words odysseus hamlet and faust on the blackboard
the class of boys is attentive
next to him his friend holger schluter
across the way rudolf
the notion of secrecy is central to western literature
you may say the whole idea of character in fiction is defined by people holding specific information which for various reasons sometimes perverse sometimes noble they are determined not to
michael looks content
the bell goes
the boys come pouring out cheerfully into the corridor and head to the next classroom
michaels demeanour has changed
theres a knowingness a swagger a confidence which is new
michael lingers for a moment then slopes off in the opposite direction alone
michael comes out the back door of the school unobserved climbs over the railings and starts to run down the street
michael is almost asleep hanna awake
you never tell me what youve been studying
do you learn languages
say something in latin
michael thinks a moment
quo quo scelesti ruitis
aut cur dexteris aptantur enses conditi
michael smiles slightly
do you want some greek
michael grins pleased to be able to do something
he goes and gets his satchel
hanna turns on a light
oi men ippeon stroton oi de pesedon oi da naon phais epi gan malainan emmenai kalliston ego de ken otto tis eratai
how can you tell
how do you know when youve no idea what it means
hanna looks at him a moment
what about in german
do you have anything
well im writing an essay
its about a play
by a writer called gotthold ephraim lessing
perhaps youve heard of him
hanna makes no reaction
the plays called emilia galotti
have you got it
michael reaches down to the satchel and pulls out a book
you can read it
id rather listen to you
there is a silence as michael absorbs the idea
im not very good
michael grins embarrassed then opens the book
the setting one of the princes chambers
prince complaints nothing but complaints petitions nothing but petitions
for goodness sake just imagine that people actually envy us
they are in the bath together
hanna takes a piece of soap and runs it lovingly down his cheek
then she passes the soap across his stomach
youre good at it arent you
good at what
why are you smiling
because i didnt think i was good at anything
michael is playing handball with terrific physical confidence
a couple of bruising physical encounters
holger rudolf and michael all laugh
the whistle blows
an empty tram moving through the eerie early morning streets
michael appears walking alongside it and gets on
michael is sitting in the second carriage
he looks up
the conductress is hanna
at first she does not notice him
michael watches waiting to be noticed
she turns round and looks at him
he smiles in greeting but she makes no acknowledgement at all
she turns away
he frowns bewildered
the tram is heading out of town
hanna is now talking animatedly to the driver
they are getting on very well laughing together and chatting
michael is still by himself in the second carriage looking foolish
the tram comes to a halt and passengers get on
hanna is now in the busy second carriage collecting tickets
michael looks up expectantly
but as he holds up his ticket hanna makes no reaction except to clip it
she turns away without speaking
the tram comes to a halt again and michael humiliated bolts for the door
michael watches the tram disappears up the hill
he looks around lost in the middle of nowhere
a tractor goes by workers heading to the fields
michael sets off to walk back to town
michael is on the stairs as hanna comes up in her uniform
what was all that about
hanna lets herself in saying nothing
hanna has gone in to put down her things at the kitchen table
michael follows desperate
i got up at
specially its the first day of the holidays id been planning to surprise you poor little baby
got up at four thirty and on your holidays too
what is this
i was on your tram
you totally ignored me
what do you think i was doing
why the hell do you think i was there
michael has yelled in desperation
hanna looks him straight in the eye
i havent the slightest idea
and what you do is your business not mine
hanna turns and moves away
and if you wanted to speak to me i was in the first carriage
so why did you sit in the second
hanna goes to run a bath
and now thanks very much ive been working i need a bath
get out id like to be by myself
i didnt mean to upset you
you dont have the power to upset me
you dont matter enough to upset me
she takes off her clothes to get in
as soon as she does he gets up and goes into the other room
he sits by himself miserable
he hears her bathing
then finally gets up and goes back in
she is still in the bath
i dont know what to say
ive never been with a woman
weve been together four weeks and i cant live without you
even the thought of it kills me
hanna looks at him thoughtfully
i sat in the second carriage because i thought you might kiss me
kid you thought we could make love in a tram
but michael has a more urgent question
is it true what you said
that i dont matter to you
in the bath she shakes her head
do you forgive me
do you love me
she looks at him
then she nods
michael is sitting on the side of the bed
hanna comes in wrapped in a towel
do you have a book
well i do
i took something with me this morning
what is it
its another play
michael gets it out of his pocket
hanna has lain down on the bed completely content
were changing the order we do things
read to me first kid
then we make love
michael sits at the foot of the bed and starts to read
intrigue and love a play by friedrich schiller
hanna is baking bread
michael is on a chair beside her with a book
the odyssey by homer
whats an odyssey
its a journey
he sets out on a journey
he starts to read
sing to me of the man muse the man of twists and turns driven time and again off course once he had plundered the hallowed heights of troy
many cities of men he saw and learned their minds many pains he suffered heartsick at the open sea fighting to save his life and bring his comrades home
hanna is in the bath
michael is reading a shakespeare sonnet to her
and we will some new pleasures prove of golden sands and crystal brooks with silken lights and silver hooks
she pulls him into the bath
hanna is sewing
michael is reading huckleberry finn
i poked into the place aways and encountered a little open patch as big as a bedroom all hung around with vines and found a man lying there asleep and
by jinks it was my old jim
he starts acting out jim and the two of them collapse laughing
michael is at the bottom of the bed
hanna is lying inside
he is reading lady chatterleys lover
lady chatterley felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her
for a moment he was still inside her
this is disgusting
where did you get this
i borrowed it from someone at school
you should be ashamed
michael reads tin tin to hanna who is lying on the bed
they are both looking at the pictures
blistering barnacles and a thundering typhoon
it is water
but what on earth did you expect it to be
by thunder whisky
come now captain you cant be serious
all right kid thats enough for today
they fall back onto the bed
i was wondering do you think you could get some time off
maybe we could go for a trip
what sort of trip
id love to go bicycling
just for two days
michael reaches for a book
ive got a guide book
ive worked out the route
look what do you think
hannas look is so far away she doesnt seem to hear the question
then i think you like planning dont you
she throws the book away and they begin to make love
dawn breaking outside the window
michael is working at his desk the surface covered in stamps his collection book open
he picks one with a pyramid on it and looks at it
underneath michaels voice reading intrigue and love by schiller
im not frightened
im not frightened of anything
why should i be
i welcome obstacles because theyll be like mountains i can fly over to be in your arms
the more i suffer the more ill love
seen from outside a shop full of stamps
michael and a stamp dealer with white hair and a moustache
michael is offering his pyramid stamp his gestures becoming desperate as the stamp dealer shakes his head clearly not giving him as much as he hopes
then michael concedes the dealer concedes and a bunch of notes are handed across
michael runs exhilarated out into the street
danger will only increase my love it will sharpen it it will give it spice
ill be the only angel you need
on this arm luise you will go dancing through life
you will leave life even more beautiful than you entered it
heaven will take you back and look at you and say only one thing can make a soul complete and that thing is love
hanna and michael are whizzing down a hill together on bicycles
he has a rucksack
its a rural paradise hills on all sides a gleaming river below the sun shining brightly
she is wearing a blue dress
they come to a cafe and sit down outside
they pick up the menus on the table
a waitress arrives
so what would you like to have
what are you having
ill have what you have
michael starts giving the order
next to them are a group of boy scouts who are laughing among themselves
theres sausages sausages or sausages
give it to me come on give it here
let me have a look
you always have the same thing
they all laugh
hanna watches them nervously
the meal finished michael is alone paying the bill
i hope your mother was happy
she enjoyed her meal very much
the waitress goes
hanna returns from inside
michael holds out his arm to her which she takes
they walk away towards their bikes
he is smiling
michael looks round then dares to reach across and kiss her on the lips
the waitress watches
they get off their bikes at a small church
michael stops and gets out a map and a guide book
here let me show you where were going
its ok kid
i dont want to know
the sound of a choir from inside
michael and hanna enter tentatively to find a choir rehearsing bach
it is a traditional german scene whole families singing together at the altar
hanna is transported entranced at the sound of the music
hanna is in a river the water up to her calves her skirt tied round her thighs
she is completely absorbed
then she looks up aware of being watched
michael is sitting with a notebook
what are you doing
im writing a poem
can i hear it
its not ready
ill read it to you one day
michael now is standing by his desk
he opens a drawer
he takes out the recognizable notebook
he opens its yellowing pages and looks at the poetry
then flips the pages to some handwritten lists the words odyssey schnitzler chekhov zweig with numbers beside them
michael flaps it shut puts it back and turns to go out
michael leaves his apartment block
he gets into his black mercedes
michael is listening on the radio to the same bach music they heard in the church
he drives through the thriving modern city
beyond the huge cranes and gouged out building sites of a city under construction
michael swings his car into place
he gets out and heads across the road prosperous purposeful
an assistant meets michael with his robe which he pulls on as he walks quickly through an elaborate lobby
gerhard bade also in his fifties also robed falls in step
you all right michael
youd better hurry
you know what shes like
a robed assistant is waiting outside the door with documents he hands to michael
they all go in
michael joins his client just seconds before the female judge comes in and everyone stands
the judge looks at michael disapprovingly sensing his lateness
michael sits thinking back
a sheriffs posse of sixteen year old girls come laughing blushing towards the classroom
one of them is talking excitedly to the other
im just going to pretend ive been here for years im not going to behave in any special way
you just wait
you wait and see
they smile together and head for the classroom
the boys are already in place dotted round as the girls come in
there are cries of here they come
then the teacher comes in
good morning ladies
gentlemen please welcome your new fellow students treat them with courtesy please
not far from michael a girl sits across the aisle virginal with brown hair brown summer skin
my names sophie
the teacher comes in
the class quietens
the teacher is in full flow
michael cant take his eyes off sophie
everyone believes that homers subject is homecoming
in fact the odyssey is a book about a journey
home is a place you dream of its not a place you ever attain
the teacher breaks off
berg i dont mean to distract you but were meant to studying homer not studying sophia
the whole class cracks up
michael is riveted as sophie swims fast and lithe through the water
around him young people are lounging round on towels
its the social centre
holger and rudolf are rubbing their hair with towels as sophie approaches
michael the waters fantastic
its wonderful isnt it
its going to be a great summer
michael looks across to where a group of americans are shouting and playing a very loud game of volleyball
now the americans have allowed us back in our own lake
why are they so loud
you should see their stores
they have everything
everything mankind could ever dream of
you dont like americans
just its more fun without them
he looks sophie straight in the eye
there is a sudden silence michael looking straight at sophie
sophie looks down
then michael moves slightly to pack up his stuff
why do you leave early
he always leaves early
michael is cycling back towards town a smile on his face
michael flies up the stairs then goes in
hanna is sitting sewing
he kisses her on the cheek as he gets out a book
im sorry im late
i was held up at school
at once he sits down opposite her
the lady with the little dog
by anton chekhov
hanna looks seeing right through him
the talk was that a new face had appeared on the promenade a lady with a little dog
a huge tram shed full of empty trams
hanna is at the end of the garage talking to the superviser a large man in his fifties
schmitz one moment
weve got good news for you
your work is good were going to promote you
to work with me in the office
its more money
he moves away
hanna looks distraught
michael is watching sophie swimming a look of anxiety in his eye when holger touches his shoulder
get a move on were leaving early today

its your birthday
were giving you a party
holger and rudolf disappear to get dressed
sophie appears in her swimming costume
come on its a surprise
we thought youd like it
weve been planning it for weeks
i promised someone id do something else
the others are furious with him
they all go off
michael is cycling towards hannas apartment his hair wet from the lake looking equally unhappy
hanna is sitting unhappily as michael reads to her
they are both in a bad mood
oh kid kid
hanna just shrugs
she goes and sits at the table to drink tea
michael is irritated
you never ask you never bother to ask how i am
you never say
it just happens to be my birthday
its my birthday thats all
in fact youve never even asked when it is
look if you want a fight kid
no i dont want a fight
whats wrong with you
what business is it of yours
she has snapped at him razor like
its always on your terms
we do what you want
its always what you want
my friends were giving me a party
well then why are you here
go back to your party
isnt that what you want
hanna puts down her cup angry
she goes into the bedroom and slams the door
he sits the magic of the day gone
he gets up and opens the bedroom door
hanna is on the bed
and its always me that has to apologize
hanna lets time go by
then you dont have to apologize
no one has to apologize
no one can make you
hanna reaches for a book from beside the bed
she throws it down on the cover
war and peace kid
hanna is on the edge of the bath running water
she has a pale blue flowered smock
she is running with sweat
the smock sticks to her
michael gets out a book
hanna drops lavender oil into the bath
michael stands in the bath and she washes his body
they are making love on the bed
at one point she moves on top of him
she holds his head between her hands as if she would crush the life out of him
then she lets go
they are both sweating exhausted
she looks a moment
now you must go back to your friends
michael has gone
hanna washes out milk bottles and empties them into the sink
then she picks up her luggage and leaves the empty apartment
michael is sitting on the pier watching as holger rudolf and sophie swim competitively out to a pontoon then turn back full of energy and high spirits
michael watches for a while then suddenly he gets up and starts to run away from them all
you all right
but michael is running away across the lakeside beach
michael opens the door
he goes in
the apartment is emptied the rented furniture in place all trace of hanna gone
he looks round
he looks at the empty bath the tap above it
he opens the kitchen cupboards some coffee sugar thats about it
he goes into the bedroom the bed stripped bare
he lies down on the bed
michael lying on the bed curled up in his clothes like a foetus asleep
the family at breakfast
michael slips quietly in the main door trying to go to his room without being heard
emily runs to look
sheepishly michael appears
where were you last night
i stayed at a friends
he seems to know exactly whats been going on
get the boy something to eat
i think we all knew youd come back to us eventually
michael is alone in the deserted pool
he is on the jetty
he takes off his clothes and slips into the water
just his head like a seals at one end just out of the water quite still
michael sitting alone thinking back
the sun slants and for a few seconds the water dazzles
he slips his head under
michael still sitting thoughtfully by himself in the empty court
then he looks up
an assistant has appeared
it is eight oclock
he gets up
julia is already at the table in a chic modern brasserie
she is a sympathetic young woman of around
when she sees him she gets up
i was early
michael leans in and kisses her on the cheek
she looks a moment then they sit down
they have eaten
they both have big glasses of red wine
its more relaxed
so how will you decide
i dont know
im happy back in berlin i suppose
youve seen your mother
i wanted to get away
there was nothing more to it
it was paris but it could have been anywhere
away from your parents
julia doesnt answer
im aware i was difficult
i wasnt always open with you
im not open with anyone
i knew you were distant
id always assumed it was my fault
how wrong can you be
julia colours on the verge of tears
then she looks away
they drive through the gleaming streets
its been raining berlin is glistening
their voices i admit it now i was nervous
i was nervous too
its silly isnt it
it is silly
thank you for dinner
ill see you very soon
michael lets julia out and is watching her safely to her door from the car
good night dad
michael suddenly gets out himself
i want to ask you a favour
i want to take you on a trip
i want to show you something
can i pick you up in the car
julia doesnt need to say anything
at ten say
michael hugs her his heart aching with love
julia goes in to her place
michael is left standing still in the plaza outside not moving
underneath the sound of what follows thirty years previously
a woman lecturer has a class of about students
from their hair their dress it could only be the s
those of you for the special seminar group on the legal system in the third reich please stay on in this room
professor rohl will be here in a moment
nearly all the students leave talking among themselves
just eight are left dotted around the huge room
michael is one of them now in a corduroy jacket and tie
there is a lull
michael looks round at the group of oddballs then finds rohl distinguished greying is already in front of them
well we seem to be quite a small group
a small group and a select one
clearly this is going to be a unique seminar
let me start by thanking those of you whove chosen to take part
good for you
a reading list gentlemen
rohl contd karl jaspers the question of german guilt
a calm student with long hair smiles at michael
she looks like francoise hardy
michael is working alone at his desk a light on
the door of his extremely modest student digs is open
marthe appears at the door silently
he looks up
so this is where you are
but neither of them move
marthe just smiles from the door
you take work seriously
oh i dont know
youre rather a serious boy
marthe shrugs slightly
its how i was brought up
what about you
are you serious
youre sure you want to work tonight
well i do
but i wont work every night
see you tomorrow
they smile at one another
the seminar group long haired hippyish is on the train professor rohl with marthe dieter and a few others
michael catches marthas eye
then he opens the window cheerful
the students are having a cigarette in front of the huge building
two black vans with barred windows come by carrying prisoners
the first one veers close to michael on the pavement then disappears into the inner courtyard
rohl smiles at michael
why all the police
theyre worried about demonstrators
for or against
a courtroom has been improvised inside the town hall
there are large windows with milky glass down the left hand side
as rohl and the students arrive the court is a melee of photographers lawyers and public
the three judges are already in place next to six selected citizens
michael and the others take places in the gallery all photographers are now asked to leave
the photographers go
the defendants please
from being noisy and chaotic the court is now silent
the first thing im going to do is hear motions from each of the defendants lawyers
judge contd theyre going to be arguing that theres no reason to keep the defendants in jail until the outcome of the forthcoming trial
dieter grins at michael in anticipation
i am going to take these cases one by one
michael is leaning down to get stuff out of his briefcase as marthe shakes a pen which isnt working
do you want a pen
ive got a pen
so michael doesnt hear as the judge speaks
there is a row of six defendants
the fifth woman is hanna her hair tied in a knot her gaze fixedly into the middle distance not looking towards the spectators
she is wearing a grey dress with short sleeves
they all sit sideways to the gallery
hanna rises to her feet
the words seem to come very quietly across a great distance
your name is hanna schmitz
it is only when the judge repeats the name that michael looks up hearing it for the first time
can you speak louder please
my name is hanna schmitz
michael is rigid blank just staring
you were born on october st
and youre now years old
you joined the ss in
what was your reason
what was your reason for joining
hanna doesnt answer
you were working at the siemens factory at the time
youd recently been offered a promotion
why did you prefer to join the ss
hanna has a defence counsel a young man beside her who is about to get up
but the judge forestalls him
ill re phrase my question
im trying to ascertain if she joined the ss freely
of her own free will
i heard there were jobs
i was working at siemens when i heard the ss was recruiting
did you know the kind of work youd be expected to do
they were looking for guards
i applied for a job
michael is intent now so are the students beside him
and you worked first at auschwitz
then you were moved to a smaller camp near cracow
rohl leans into michael
are you ok
you then helped move the prisoners west in the winter of in the so called death marches
michael is hanging out of the window of the train smoking a cigarette
michael sits down in his seat
rohl moves to sit opposite him
so what did you think
i dont know
it wasnt quite what i expecting
in what way
what were you expecting
rohl is looking at him
michael doesnt answer
i thought it was exciting
why did you think it exciting
because its justice
the train hurtles through the german countryside
a student party in a candle lit room
marthe is singing to a guitar
its been going on for hours the students are on the floor with beer and cigarettes
the front door is open
dieter beer in hand looks out to the balcony where he can see michael bent away from them all by himself
michael his arms on the balcony is smoking looking out into the night
his eye lands on a student room in which a couple are making love
the small student group is now rattling around informally in the big lecture room
i need to correct an impression
dieter said yesterday this was about justice
but is it
rohl contd if it were about justice you might ask why has it taken so long
the war ended twenty years ago
remember thereve been no significant trials between nuremburg in and the auschwitz trials a couple of years ago
thats a long gap
whats the reason for the gap
rohl waits a moment for a student to answer
id have thought it was obvious
its cowardice isnt it
its bad conscience
its the big cover up
after the war
the german people didnt want to look at what theyd done
is that right
because they had too much to hide
all our parents are liars
all right mine are
so its left to us isnt it
because were not implicated
so thats all right then
no but seriously dieters right
my parents i cant even talk to them
i dont love them
how could i
how could anyone love them
because theyve told themselves so many lies they cant remember the truth let alone admit it
isnt that why we signed up for this seminar
i dont know
you tell me
speaking for myself
im not sure any more
rohl is staring at him thoughtfully
what did your father do dieter
if you want to know he was in the waffen ss
there are some smiles but dieter rides over the reaction
thats what i mean thats what im saying
so were a million other germans
thats exactly my point
thats why its better not to pretend this is about justice
forgive me nor is it about getting into an emotional state
it has no purpose if its just the young giving their parents a bad time
theres a silence
thats clearly why some of them are there
so what is it about
what do you think
societies think they operate by something called morality
but they dont
they operate by something called law
youre not guilty of anything merely by working at auschwitz
people worked at auschwitz
precisely have been convicted and only for murder
to prove murder you have to prove intent
thats the law
remember the question is never was it wrong
but was it legal
and not by our laws no by the laws at the time
dieter frowns unhappy
but isnt that
the law is narrow
rohl looks unapologetic
on the other hand i suspect people who kill other people tend to be aware that its wrong
rohl is leaning forward attentive
hanna is standing opposite the judge who holds up a book called mother miss schmitz youre familiar with this book
parts of it have already been read out in court
judge contd its an american publication which has been translated
its by a survivor a prisoner who survived ilana mather
yes i know
i know ilana mather
she was in the camp wasnt she when she was a child
she was with her mother
the judge waits
hanna seems arrogant defiant
in the book she describes a selection process
at the end of the months labour every month sixty inmates were selected
they were picked out to be sent from the satellite camp back to auschwitz
thats right isnt it
yes its right
and so far each of your fellow defendants has specifically denied being part of that process
now im going to ask you
were you part of it
there is a stir among the other defendants and in the court
they start talking to their lawyers
so you helped make the selection
you admit that
then tell me how did that selection happen
hanna shrugs slightly as though it were obvious
there were six guards so we decided wed choose ten people each
thats how we did it every month
wed all choose ten
are you saying your fellow defendants took part in the process
we all did
even though theyve denied it
but you admit it
youre saying you took part in the process
the other defendants stir with animosity but the judge is intent following his own line
did you not realise you were sending these women to their deaths
hanna nods slightly
yes but there were new arrivals new women were arriving all the time so of course we had to move some of the old ones on
im not sure you understand
we couldnt keep everyone
there wasnt room
the judge frowns genuinely surprised that she doesnt seem to understand his point
no but what im saying let me rephrase to make room you were picking women out and saying you you and you have to be sent back to be killed
well what would you have done
hanna is looking at the judge a perfectly straight question
michael smiles slightly proud of her
everyone in the court waits for the judge to answer
rohl is impassive
but hanna follows her own thoughts
she quietly asks herself a question
so should i never have signed up at siemens
michael is alone smoking
on a bench side by side are two women
one is very small dark in her sixties
the other is composed formidable elegant in her thirties
rose and ilana mather
they look up catching michaels eye
then a clerk leans in to the younger woman
mather theyre ready for you now
the two women go into the court
the door closes
michael is alone in the now deserted lobby unwilling to go back
then he goes to the door
he opens it a little
the sound of the trial
he opens the door fully
michael can see that it is ilana who is testifying
the court is conspicuously packed
large black and white photographs of the labour camp now dominate the room
michael comes quietly into the back of the room as the trial goes on
michael has pushed past a couple of people to sit down near rose who is sitting in the body of the court
he looks across to the defendants
rita beckhart a large older woman is one of a couple who isnt bothering to listen
in your book you describe the process of selection
you were made to work and then when you were no longer any use to them then they sent you back to auschwitz to be killed
are there people here today who made that selection
i need you to identify them
can you please point them out
ilana points with her finger at the defendants
the last finger has been to hanna
michael watches but hanna does not react
each of the guards would choose a certain number of women
hanna schmitz chose differently
in what way differently
she had favourites
girls mostly young
we all remarked on it she gave them food and places to sleep
in the evening she asked them to join her
we all thought well you can imagine what we thought
hanna stares back impassive
then we found out she was making these women read aloud to her
they were reading to her
at first we thought this guard this guard is more sensitive shes more human shes kinder
often she chose the weak the sick she picked them out she seemed to be protecting them almost
but then she dispatched them
is that kinder
hanna looks back not apologizing
michael sits alone head in hands in despair
now rose is testifying
the court is quiet focused
i want to move on now to the march
as i understand it you and your daughter were marched for many months
it was the winter of
our camp was closed down we were told we had to move on
but the plan kept changing every day
women were dying all around us in the snow
half of us died on the march
my daughter says in the book less a death march more a death gallop
michael looks along the row to where ilana is now sitting
please tell us about the night in the church
michael watches as rose looks across to ilana
ilana stares back at her
michael watches the exchange as rose nods as if accepting she must go ahead and speak
that night we actually thought we were lucky because we had a roof over our heads
wed arrived in a village as always the guards took the best quarters they took the priests house
but they let us sleep in a church
there was a bombing raid
in the middle of the night
at first we could only hear the fire it was in the steeple
then we could see burning beams and they began to crash to the floor
everyone rushed rushed to the doors
but the doors had been locked on the outside
the church burned down
nobody came to open the doors
is that right
even though you were all burning to death
how many people were killed
everyone was killed
how did you survive
i needed to get away from the other women
because they were panicking they were screaming
i couldnt stand it
i couldnt stand their screaming
i was more frightened of the other women than i was of the fire
so i too my daughter and led her to the upper floor
i cant defend what i did
its impossible to defend
i took ilana in my arms and i led her towards the fire
there was a small gallery at the side of the church on the upper level
it saved our lives
the gallery didnt burn
rose turns in tears to look at ilana
i want to thank you for coming to this country today to testify
the group is back in the big hall
but the atmosphere is grim
its a while before dieter speaks
i dont know
i dont know what were doing any more
you keep telling us to think like lawyers but theres something disgusting about this
rohl is very still like an analyst who is finally leading his patient to the heart of things
this didnt happen to the germans
it happened to the jews
everyone is shocked at his violent passion
what are we trying to do
were trying to understand
six women locked three hundred jews in a church and let them burn
what is there to understand
tell me im asking what is there to understand
michael cant answer
dieter gets up outraged now
i started out believing in this trial i thought it was great now i think its just a diversion
diversion from what
you choose six women you put them on trial you say they were the evil ones they were the guilty ones
dieter contd because one of the victims happened to write a book
thats why theyre on trial and nobody else
do you know how many camps there were in europe
dieter turns furious
people go on about how much did everyone know
what did they know
that isnt the question
the question is how could you let it happen
and better why didnt you kill yourself when you found out
one of the group walks out
thats how many
there were thousands of camps
dieters passion is so great that everyone is shaken
look at that woman
the woman youre always staring at
im sorry but you are
michael is white
the atmosphere is electric
i dont know which woman you mean
you know what id do
put the gun in my hand id shoot her myself
michael walks along an empty wooded road miles from anywhere
the sun is shining through the trees behind him
the wire fence of a concentration camp deserted
michael with a back pack goes alone through the metal gate
michael walks among the deserted empty huts
inside one of the huts michael is by himself staring at a line of empty beds
he moves on overwhelmed lost
he passes through the showers
then he comes to a room with vast metal cages on either side
in the cages the countless dusty shoes of the exterminated
michael opens a door and walks into a room with a line of gas ovens
he walks past them
then he stands beside them his head down
hanna is standing being examined by the judge
large photographs and maps of the village with the lay out of the church are now on display
why did you not unlock the doors
hanna doesnt reply
why did you not unlock the doors
the judge turns to the row of defendants
ive asked all of you and im getting no answer
two of the victims are in this court
they deserve an answer
ilana and rose are not far away from michael and the students
the judge puts down a bound handwritten document
here this is the ss report
you all have copies
there is a flurry of paperwork among the defendants and lawyers as they turn to their copies
this is the report which was written approved and signed by all of you immediately after the event
in the written report you all claim you didnt even know about the fire until after it happened
but that isnt true is it
the judge waits
it isnt true
i dont know what youre asking
the first thing im asking is why didnt you unlock the doors
hanna takes a look to the other defendants
for the first time her poise is crumbling
for the obvious reason
why couldnt you
we were guards
our job was to guard the prisoners
we couldnt just let them escape
and if they escaped then youd be blamed youd be charged you might even be executed
the judge waits
if we opened the doors then there would have been chaos
how could we have restored order
hanna contd it happened so fast
it was snowing
the bombs there were flames all over the village
then the screaming began
it got worse and worse
and if theyd all come rushing out we couldnt just let them escape
we were responsible for them
so you did know what was happening
you did know
you made a choice
you let them die rather than risk letting them escape
hanna cant answer she has no answer
the other defendants have made an allegation against you
have you heard this allegation
hanna does not reply
they say you were in charge
it isnt true
i was just one of the guards
the other defendants interrupt to call out she was in charge
did you write the report
we all discussed what to say
we all wrote it together
she wrote it
she wrote the report
she was in charge
is that true
and i didnt write the report
does it matter who did
rita beckhart has called out from her place
the judge looks at hanna a moment
i need to see a sample of your handwriting
i need to establish who wrote the report
at once hannas counsel rises
im sorry but i really dont see how thats appropriate
nearly twenty years have gone by
somebody take her this piece of paper
are you really going to compare handwriting of twenty years ago with handwriting of today
give her the paper
counsel approach the bench
a piece of paper and a pen are put down in front of hanna
her counsel moves to the bench
michael stares first at her then at the pen and paper an apprehension rising in him
michael thinks back to hanna in her bedroom saying no you read to her looking puzzled at the menu on the bicycle trip and to her throwing a book away
in the apartment
at this moment michael realises she is illiterate
back in the courtroom hanna looks up to the judge to stop the conference
theres no need
i wrote the report
michael in a panic pushes along his row past rohl and the others who all look up knowing something is going on
hanna turns as if sensing him behind her
michael is sitting on the steps outside the lecture room
rohl walks straight past him
youve been skipping seminars
michael comes into the room and sits down smoking a cigarette
michael looks at him
i have a piece of information
concerning one of the defendants
something theyre not admitting
michael stubs out his cigarette
you dont need me to tell you
its perfectly clear you have a moral obligation to disclose it to the court
it happens this information is favourable to the defendant
it can help her case
it may even affect the outcome certainly the sentencing
theres a problem
the defendant herself is determined to keep this information secret
two students come in for the seminar
a moment please
chastened they leave
what are her reasons
because shes ashamed
ashamed of what
michael doesnt answer
have you spoken to her
of course not
why of course not
i cant do that
i cant talk to her
what we feel isnt important
its utterly unimportant
the only question is what we do
rohl gets up
if people like you dont learn from what happened to people like me then what the hell is the point of anything
hanna is sitting on the edge of her bed
a guard comes to the door
you have a visitor
hanna is taken aback for a moment
then she gets up
michael is standing smoking a cigarette in the waiting area
a whole number of visitors old people children families are waiting
some kids are playing with a football
then a guard arrives and calls out names
michaels name is called
hanna is led swiftly down a prison corridor towards her meeting and sat down at a desk to wait
michael is led in the group towards the visiting room
it has come on to snow
as he walks towards the room he loses heart
he changes his mind
the rest of the group go on as he falls behind watching them go
he begins to turn back
hanna sits down at the empty table waiting
michael turns away and heads back the way he came
hanna looks round
nobody is coming
she waits more
hanna is still waiting
then she is led back to her cell
michael appears at the door of marthes room
she is working at her desk
he smiles and closes the door
youve taken your time
she starts to pull his clothes off
he lets her
he makes no move to undress her
she takes all his clothes off until he is naked and she remains clothed
he looks at her a moment then takes her in his arms and they go down on the bed
they make love
marthe is apparently asleep michael awake
as quietly as he can michael tries to slip away
where are you going
i need to sleep by myself
hanna is standing naked at the sink preparing herself for the day
michael is lying in his own bed staring up at the ceiling not able to sleep
michael reluctantly pushes back the cover and gets naked out of bed
slowly he begins to dress
hanna washes herself naked
michael is dressed now
he stands in front of his mirror adjusting his tie
hanna stands in front of the mirror tying her tie
there is a small inadequate mirror in which she checks her dress a black suit a white blouse and black tie
she looks very formal
hanna is led through the prison by a guard
a lot of people heading into the courtroom
as the seminar group goes in michael hangs back
rohl looks at him as he goes through the doors
michael is left outside then goes to watch as the vans arrive
hanna and the prisoners are led into the court
hannas suit is so formal that members of the public call out
dieter leans in to marthe
hanna walks on to her place
everyone rises as the judges come in to take their places
hannas face is resigned without expression
the judges sit
the whole court goes quiet
the court finds guilty the defendants rita beckhart karolina steinhof regina kreutz angela zieber andrea luhmann jointly aiding and abetting murder in three hundred cases
the court finds the defendant hanna schmitz guilty of murder in three hundred cases
there are tears in michaels eyes as he watches
the court sentences the accused as follows
rita beckhart karolina steinhof regina kreutz angela zieber and andrea luhmann you will each serve a total sentence in prison of four years and three months
rohl marthe dieter and the students are looking down on the sentencing
michael is crying
hanna schmitz in view of your own admissions and your special role you are in a different category
the court sentences the accused schmitz to imprisonment for life
hanna is impassive not reacting
then she turns and looks up to the gallery
michael walks away through the cameras and news crews
michael sits on the train thinking
the younger michael becomes the older
michael is sitting beside julia
michael is julia is a bright little year old in a coat
the countryside speeding by
where are we going
i said ill tell you when we get there
you told me you liked surprises
i like surprises
michael walks with julia towards their old house
he looks round the memory of coming with hanna as a sick boy years earlier clear in his mind
the same landmarks
they are all three eating at the dinner table eating a small roast chicken
shes grown hasnt she
i dont know
its so long since i saw her michael how can i tell
we shouldnt have come unannounced
daddy whys she angry
even carla smiles slightly
im afraid ive have some bad news
michael contd weve already told her
gertrud and i are getting a divorce
daddys going to live in his own house
you didnt come for your fathers funeral but you come for this
you know its not easy for me to visit this town
were you really so unhappy
thats not what im saying
its not what i meant
carla looks at him hard
you mustnt worry about gertrud
im going to look after her
and anyway lets face it shes already a state prosecutor she earns far more than i do
michael im not worried about gertrud
im worried about you
exhausted by her day julia is sleeping in michaels arms
he looks down at her full of love
on the other side of a busy berlin street full of traffic michael holds julias hand a loving father to guide her across the street
gertrud has come to the door a shrewd looking intelligent woman a little older than michael very thin in slacks and a blouse
michael is standing outside with julia
gertrud leans down and scoops julia up kisses her
michael stands on the step hovering
do you mind if i dont ask you in
i dont mind at all
ive a lot to do in fact
it doesnt look like it
he stands not going
i took her to see where i grew up
you went to the west
my god what a trip
we went to say hello to granny
daddy took you to see carla did he
she was strange
come on lets see whats on tv
gertrud gives julia her supper and puts her in front of the tv
then she comes back to michael
i bet she was strange
you could say
she always was
why on earth did you decide to do that
i dont know
gertrud says nothing
i suppose if im honest we went because i wanted to re establish contact
with your mother
and did you succeed
they both smile
are you all right
he touches her arm
michael youre meant to be an intelligent man
dont you know its very hard to receive contact if youre not willing to give it
gertrud looks level not unkind
say goodbye to julia
michael turns to say goodbye
michael standing in the empty room
its eerily silent
he goes to his bookcase
he runs his fingers along the spines as hanna once did
he takes out a paperback of the odyssey
he looks at it a moment then he starts to read to himself
sing to me of the man muse the man of twists and turns driven time and again off course once he had plundered the hallowed heights of troy
he sits back
hanna is in her cell folding her blanket
she is a new austerity a greyness about her
her cell is modern but without decoration
a guard comes along the corridor calling out mail
she leans into hannas cell to tell her she has mail
hanna is obviously surprised
hanna reports to the mail room where she is given a big parcel which she is told to open
inside a huge batch of casette tapes and a tape machine
hanna is opening the box taking out the tapes
michael gets out a tape machine
in her cell hanna takes out the machine
michael holds the microphone
hanna puts a cassette into the machine
the odyssey by homer
in panic she turns it off
michael presses the recording button and speaks into the machine
the odyssey by homer
sing to me of the man muse the man of twists and turns driven time and again off course once he had plundered the hallowed heights of troy
many cities of men he saw and learned their minds many pains he suffered heartsick at the open sea fighting to save his life and bring his comrades home
michael is now walking up and down in his shorts and t shirt microphone in hand still reading
ah how shameless the way these mortals blame the gods
from us alone they say come all their miseries
middle of the night
michael is lying on his back still reading
who are you
where are you from
im wonderstruck you drank my drugs youre not bewitched
michael takes a cassette and puts it into a white box
he writes on the side odyssey
then he reaches up to put it on a shelf next to boxes separately marked odyssey
then he takes out a small notebook and cross references the new tape in a handwritten list
hanna is lying on the bed
zeus from the very start the thunder king has hated the race of atreus with a vengeance
michaels voice contd his trustiest weapon womens twisted wiles
hanna smiles with pleasure at his reading
a montage of michael reading and hanna listening
michael is reading different books
he is animated now excited
there are extracts from the old man and the sea hemingway anatol schnitzler the world of yesterday zweig and doctor zhivago pasternak
michael catching fire with excitement with what he is doing
hanna collecting the tapes from the mail room and organizing on her shelves her library growing
hanna is lying in bed listening to a new tape
the lady with the little dog by anton chekhov
the talk was that a new face had appeared on the promenade a lady with a little dog
hanna is walking round with other prisoners in sequence
suddenly she stops dead an idea hitting her
the library is right next to the mail room
hanna walks past the mail room and goes to the library counter
i want to take out a book
do you have the lady with the little dog
whats your name
the librarian goes to get it
hanna stands waiting and looks at the stacks of books for the first time seeing possibility
hanna is back in the cell
she puts down a new parcel and a book
she puts the parcel to one side then opens the book
she then winds back the tape which is already in the recorder
the lady with the little dog a story by anton chekhov
the talk was
she turns off the tape
she runs her finger along the title the lady with the little dog
she gets down a small decorated metal tin and takes a pencil from it
she starts making the sounds
the the the
l l l etc
hanna is working now circling the word the each time it comes in the book
the book is covered in marks
michael is coming down a busy kreuzberg street
he goes into his block
he opens the door the place is much more lived in
he picks up his mail
thumbing through it he sees a letter in childish handwriting
michael frowns opening it and taking out a piece of paper
michael is holding a letter
he looks down at the writing thanks for the latest kid
i really liked it
he stares then puts it down and steps back stunned
hanna stands with a new package
she opens it excitedly
she takes out tapes
she looks for writing a letter
there is none
she turns the packing paper over and over but theres nothing
she stands desolate
hanna effortfully writing various letters just a single message on each
the pen working agonizingly across the paper
next michael continuing to read to her on the machine
hanna still writing
then finally many attempts at the same sentence written many times michael is reading the latest letter from hanna
he looks at it
do you receive my letters
write to me kid
michael opens a drawer in a file box on the floor
there is a stack of her letters inside
he puts the latest on top of the pile and closes the drawer
hanna stands at her window in despair
michael is at his desk with the phone in his hand with a typed letter in front of him
youre michael berg
you got my letter
i have it here
as i say hanna schmitz is coming up for release very soon
michael fingers the letter a moment
ms brenner is sitting at her desk in a simple modern office
hanna has been in prison for over twenty years
she has no family
she has no friends
youre her only contact
and im told you dont visit her
michael is sitting quite still
when she gets out shes going to need a job
shes going to need somewhere to live
you cant imagine how frightening the modern world will seem to her
there is a silence
im still here
i have no one else to ask
if you dont take responsibility for her then hanna has no future at all
its kind of you
thank you for letting me know
michael puts the phone down
he looks as if he has just been handed a sentence
he gets up and stares at the wall which is now stacked with all the books he has read
then he goes to his balcony
michael stands looking out over berlin from his balcony
michael walks along the road by the prison wall then goes to the guichet to sign in
michael is waiting in a small barred waiting area as ms brenner walks across the yard to open the gate and let michael in
youre michael berg
we were expecting you earlier
ms brenner is walking michael up the steps towards the prison canteen
they pass guards and inmates
i should warn you for a long time hanna held herself together
she was very purposeful
in the last few years shes different
shes let herself go
ms brenner leads michael to the door of the canteen
theyre in the canteen
theyre just finishing lunch
michael sees an old woman who is sitting at a table
her blue dress is stretched too tight across her heavy body
her hair is grey
she has a book in her lap but shes not reading it
a few prisoners are finishing their meal
it takes michael a moment to realise the old woman is hanna
then hanna becomes aware of being watched
she turns and looks round
at once her face lights up
michael smiles back but as he approaches her he fixes onto her inquiring look and sees the light go out of her eyes as if she has looked at him
and been disappointed
he sits down opposite her
she smiles weary
youve grown up kid
she takes his hand
there is a long silence michael unable to think of anything to say
he withdraws his hand
ive got a friend whos a tailor he makes my suits
hell give you a job
and ive found you somewhere to live
its a nice place
quite small but nice
i think youll like it
theres a moments silence
there are various social programmes cultural stuff i can sign you up for
and theres a public library very close
hanna nods slightly
you read a lot
i prefer being read to
there is a short silence
thats over now isnt it
michael doesnt answer
did you get married
yes i did
we have a daughter
im not seeing as much of her as i would like
id like to see a great deal more of her
after a few moments he concedes
the marriage didnt last
there is a silence
have you spent a lot of time thinking about the past
you mean with you
no i didnt mean with me
before the trial i never thought about the past
i never had to
what do you feel now
hanna looks a moment a haunting look searching him
it doesnt matter what i think
it doesnt matter what i feel
the dead are still dead
theres a silence
i wasnt sure what youd learnt
i have learnt kid
ive learnt to read
michael stares devastated
ill pick you up next week ok
that sounds a good plan
quietly or shall we make a big fuss
they look at each other
the other prisoners have already gone
they stand up
she scans his face again searching for his thoughts
he takes her in his arms a little awkward
take care kid
they walk side by side back towards the door
then by way of saying goodbye she takes his hand
see you next week
she stretches her arm out before she lets go of his hand then vanishes inside
michael walks on alone
michael comes out of the main entrance
he stands a moment looking round at the evening
michael walks to his car
the room is simple a bedroom to one side a bathroom to the other
it is all furnished with simple functional furniture
the end of a hard days work
michael hangs a picture over the desk a landscape reminiscent of where they once went cycling
the job is done
he looks round grimly content
hanna is lying on her bed fully dressed
she gets up and gets some books down from the shelf
she puts them one by one in a pile on the table
then she takes off her shoes
she stands up and climbs onto the pile of books on the table
her bare feet on the books
then she reaches up
michael gets out of the car
he is carrying a bunch of flowers
he walks towards the prison
he leans in to the guard who is in a modern office
from the far end of the corridor michael is seen sitting on a bench
ms brenner comes out of her office and murmurs in his ear
michael is seen nodding ashen
the two of them come together down the corridor
they stop at the open door of the cell
the body has been removed
the books are still on the floor
michael goes in
a bare table a chair a bed a closet a toilet in the corner behind the door
there are shelves with books an alarm clock a stuffed bear two mugs instant coffee tea tins
she didnt pack
she never intended to leave
ms brenner looks at him in confirmation
michael looks at the two lower shelves on which are ranged the tapes with the cassette machine
above the bed are a series of cuttings pictures torn from magazines showing meadows hillsides pasture cherry trees
one in particular a burst of autumnal colours
michael kneels on the bed to look at them
there are quotations articles recipes even sayings in hannas childish handwriting spring lets its blue banner flutter through the air is one
then he sees a newspaper photograph the young michael berg receiving a prize from the school principal
the headline michael berg receives school literature prize
ms brenner reaches out for a tea tin from the shelf
then she sits next to michael on the bed and takes out a folded sheet of paper from her suit pocket
she left me a message a sort of will
ill read out the bit that concerns you
michael looks at the effortful handwriting on the page
there is money in the old tea tin
give it to michael berg
he should send it alongside the marks in the bank to the daughter who wrote the book
its for her
she should decide what to do with it
and tell michael i said hello
tell him to get on with his life
ms brenner looks at him
do you want to see her
michael shakes his head
michael rides in a taxi into manhattan
a view of the familiar skyline
michaels taxi comes up fifth avenue
it draws up outside an expensive apartment block
michael gets out and goes in the manhattan skyline opening up behind him
a superbly appointed space full of great and expensive art
michael has taken his coat off
ilana mather appears elegant well dressed on the surface the spirit of prosperous new york
she is now in her early fifties
youre michael berg
i was expecting you
so you must tell me what exactly brings you to the united states
i was already here
i was at a conference in boston
youre a lawyer
i was intrigued by your letter but i cant say i wholly understood it
you attended the trial
almost twenty years ago
i was a law student
i remember you i remember your mother very clearly
my mother died in israel a good many years ago
michael hesitates for a moment
go on please
perhaps you heard
hanna schmitz recently died
she killed herself
ilana shakes her head
she was a friend of yours
a kind of friend
its as simple as this
hanna was illiterate for the greater part of her life
is that an explanation of her behaviour
or an excuse
michael shakes his head
she taught herself to read when she was in prison
i sent her tapes
shed always liked being read to
ilana shifts slightly
why dont you start by being honest with me
at least start that way
what was the nature of your friendship
when i was young i had an affair with hanna
ilana looks at him for a moment
im not sure i can help you mr
or rather even if i could im not willing to
i was almost sixteen when i took up with her
the affair only lasted a summer
michael just looks at her
and did hanna schmitz acknowledge the effect shed had on your life
michael stares back understood for the first time
shed done much worse to other people
ive never told anyone
people ask all the time what i learned in the camps
but the camps werent therapy
what do you think these places were
we didnt go there to learn
one becomes very clear about these things
ilana looks at him unrelenting
what are you asking for
forgiveness for her
or do you just want to feel better yourself
my advice go to the theatre if you want catharsis
go to literature
dont go to the camps
nothing comes out of the camps
ilana looks at him unrelenting
what she wanted
what she wanted was to leave you her money
i have with me
to do what
as you think fit
michael reaches for his briefcase
he takes out the lavender tea tin which he sets down on the table in front of ilana
ilana lifts the tin
when i was a little girl i had a tea tin for my treasures
not quite like this
it had cyrillic lettering
i took it with me to the camp but it got stolen
what was in it
a piece of hair from our dog
some tickets to operas my father had taken me to
it wasnt stolen for its contents
it was the tin itself which was valuable what you could do with it
she sits a moment overcome her hand on the tin
theres nothing i can do with this money
if i give it to anything associated with the extermination of the jews then to me it will seem like absolution and that is something im neither willing nor in
a position to grant
michael nods slightly
i was thinking maybe an organization to encourage literacy
theres a silence
do you know if theres a jewish organization
ill be surprised if there isnt
theres a jewish organisation for everything
not that illiteracy is a very jewish problem
there is the shadow of a smile
why dont you find out
send them the money
shall i do it in hannas name
as you think fit
ilana smiles slightly
she puts her hand on top of the tin
ill keep the tin
ilana is standing at the window watching down to the street where michael is walking away
she has the tin in her hand
when hes vanished she turns and goes into her bedroom
there on the dressing table there is a framed photo of ilana with her mother in germany before the war
she sets the tin down beside the photo
michael is driving julia in the big mercedes through the german countryside
he is tense silent
julia takes a sideways look at him but he does not respond
where are we going
i thought you liked surprises
i do like surprises
they draw up at a church
it is the same one he and hanna passed on their bicycles years before
michael and julia get out and walk towards the graveyard at the side
michael julia stand at a deserted grave side
the whole cemetery is seen
michael stoops down and uncovers a simple stone hanna schmitz
julia watching says her name
julia waits a moment
who was she
thats what i wanted to tell you
thats why were here
julia looks waiting
michael looks for a moment as if he will not go on
so tell me
there is a moment then they turn to stroll michael talking starting to tell the story
i was i was coming home from school i was ill
they walk away among the trees
