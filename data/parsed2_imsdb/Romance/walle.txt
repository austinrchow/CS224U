written by andrew stanton pete docter stars
the upbeat show tune put on your sunday clothes plays
out there theres a world outside of yonkers
distant galaxies constellations nebulas
a single planet
drab and brown
moving towards it
pushing through its polluted atmosphere
close your eyes and see it glisten
a range of mountains takes form in the haze
the mountains are piles of trash
the entire surface is nothing but waste
were gonna find adventure in the evening air
a silhouetted city in the distance
what looks like skyscrapers turns into trash
thousands of neatly stacked cubes of trash stories high
rows and rows of stacked cubes like city avenues
they go on for miles
beneath your parasol the world is all a smile
something moving on the ground far below
a figure at the foot of a trash heap
a small service robot diligently cubing trash
every inch of him engineered for trash compacting
mini shovel hands collect junk
scoop it into his open chassis
his front plate closes slowly compressing waste
a faded label on his corroded chest plate waste allocation loader earth class wall e wall e spits out a cube of trash
stacks it with the others
something catches his eye
tugs on a piece of metal stuck in the stack
the sun reflects off it
wall e checks the sky
the sun sets through the smoggy haze
and we wont come back until weve kissed a girl he places the hubcap in his compactor
presses a button on his chest
the song stops playing
the end of a work day
wall e attaches a lunch cooler to his back
whistles for his pet cockroach
the insect hops on his shoulder
they motor down from the top of a giant trash tower
wall e travels alone
traverses miles of desolate waste
oblivious to roving storms of toxic weather
passes haunting structures buried within the trash
buildings highways entire cities
everything branded with the same company logo
buy n large bnl stores restaurants banks
the corporation ran every aspect of life
theres even a bnl logo on wall es chest plate
close on newspaper wall e drives over
headline too much trash
the deck bnl ceo declares global emergency
a photo of the bnl ceo giving a weak smile
wall es old treads are threadbare
practically falling apart
cause a bumpy ride for his cockroach
he passes the remains of other rusted wall e units
fancies one with newer treads than his own
wall e now sports the newer treads
rolls past a series of holographic billboards
the solar powered ads still activate when he passes them
ad bnl logo over trash too much garbage in your face
ad starliner in space theres plenty of space out in space
ad starliners take off from earth bnl starliners leaving each day
ad wall e units wave goodbye well clean up the mess while youre away
wall e drives down a deserted overpass
activates an even larger holographic billboard
shows off a city sized luxury starliner
depicts passengers enjoying all its amenities
the jewel of the bnl fleet the axiom
spend your five year cruise in style
waited on hours a day by our fully automated crew while your captain and autopilot chart a course for non stop entertainment fine dining
and with our all access hover chairs even grandma can join the fun
theres no need to walk
putting the star in executive starliner
the bnl ceo appears at the end
waves goodbye as the axiom takes off
because at bnl space is the final fun tier
the holographic billboard powers off
reveals the axioms deserted launchpad in the distance
the mammoth structure sits across the bay
now empty and dry
a polluted dead valley
near its edge rests a wall e unit transport truck
a giant childs tonka truck left to weather the elements
a buy n large logo on its side
wall e approaches the rear of the truck
pulls on a lever
the back lowers
wall e motors up the ramp
open racks for storing wall es line both walls
knickknacks of found junk littered everywhere
the tired robot removes his newfound treads
wall e motors down the center aisle
flicks on an ancient betamax player
jury rigged to an ipod
pushes in a cassette labeled hello dolly
the image is very poor quality
actors sing and dance to put on your sunday clothes poysc
the same song wall e worked to
hums poysc wall e opens his cooler
pulls out the hubcap from his chest
looks back at the tv
mimics the dancers on the screen
pretends the hubcap is a hat
continues to unpack a spork
a rubiks cube unsolved
a zippo lighter
he presses a button by the rack of shelves
they rotate until an empty space appears
his new items are lovingly added to the shelf
the zippo joins a pre existing lighter collection
a new song it only takes a moment plays on the video
wall e is drawn to it
presses his record button
two lovers sing gently to one another
wall e tilts his head as he watches
holds his own hands
wall e motors outside
turns over his igloo cooler to clean it out
pauses to take in the night sky
stars struggle to be seen through the polluted haze
wall e presses the play button on his chest
the newly sampled it only takes a moment iotam plays
the wind picks up
a warning light sounds on wall es chest
he looks out into the night
a raging sandstorm approaches off the bay
unfazed wall e heads back in the truck
iotam still gently playing
the massive wave of sand roars closer
wall e raises the door
whistles for his cockroach to come inside
the door shuts just as the storm hits
obliterates everything in view
wall e alone in the center of his shelter
unwraps a bnl spongecake think twinkie
lays it out for the cockroach to sleep in
it happily dives in
wall e collapses himself into a storable cube
backs into an empty shelf space
rocks it like a cradle
and shuts down for the night
outside the wind howls like the hounds of hell
wall es charge meter flashes warning
groggy and lifeless
the morning sun
wall e fully exposed in its light
his front panel splayed out like a tanning shield
a solar collector
his charge meter chimes full
solar panels fold away into hiding
wall e now awake collects his lunch cooler
heads off to work
and accidentally runs over the cockroach
horrified wall e reverses
reveals the flattened insect under his tread
the cockroach simply pops back to life
ready to go
relieved wall e resumes their commute
cu of wall es hands digging into garbage
cu of trash being scooped into his chest compactor
a cube lands by the cockroach
wall e discovers a bra in the garbage
unsure what its for
tries placing it over his eyes like glasses
tosses it in his cooler
wall e finds a set of car keys
presses the remote lock
somewhere in the distance a car alarm chirps
plays with a paddle ball
the ball keeps smacking him in the face
he doesnt like it
wall e discovers a diamond ring in a jewel case
throws out the ring
keeps the case
the jewel case drops into the cooler then
an old boot
wall e finds a fire extinguisher
foam blasts in his face
its tossed far far away from his cooler
wall es shovel hand strikes something solid
faces a refrigerator much larger than himself
cu on fridge door
a welding beam moves down its center
it emits from between wall es split binocular eyes
the door falls apart in two pieces
a small plant in its early stage of growth
wall e is entranced
carefully he extracts the section of earth around it
wall e gently places the plant inside the old boot
dusts dirt off the leaves
robot and faithful cockroach return home
wall e stops short of the threshold
stares at the ground
quivers on the dirt
a single laser point of light
wall e moves to touch it
the dot races along the ground
wall e drops his igloo
chases after the dot
the dot leads wall e deep into the polluted expanse
he is so fixated on it he doesnt notice coming from every direction
all racing into the valley over the contour of the terrain
triangulating towards a center
wall es dot suddenly stops
slowly he reaches for it
cant grab it
all the dots converge in front of him
the ground shakes
wall e becomes confused
doesnt see above him
the sun growing brighter behind the cloud cover
wall e senses he should look to the sky
now three suns are descending on him
wall e runs for it
an enormous column of fire blocks his path
a second column of fire
wall e cubes the ground beneath him
digs in just as a tide of flame carpets the ground
then suddenly quiet
wall es head rises out of the dirt
glows red hot from the heat
trembles with fright
everything in shadow
something very big looms over him
wall e climbs out of his hole
bangs his head on metal
wide on a massive spaceship
rests ominously in the empty bay
a portal on its underside opens
frightened wall e tries to hide
nowhere to go
he places a small rock on his head
a device lowers to the ground on a long stem
scans the surface
wall e creeps closer for a better look
the device unfolds
wall e boxes up again
a capsule descends from a chute in the stem
robot arms emerge from the device
place the capsule on the ground
the capsule falls away in sections to reveal
a probe robot
it hovers gracefully above the ground
blue lit eyes
wall e is transfixed
watches eve from behind the device
tilts his head
shes the most beautiful thing hes ever seen
eve hovers over the ground
a blue ray emits from her front panel
fans out degrees
scans random objects and areas
the device rises back into the ship
exposes wall e
he rushes for cover behind the nearest rock
never takes his eyes off eve
watches her float away from the ship
from the ship
engines roar back to life
wall e digging furiously
the rocket takes off
again a red hot wall e peeks out from the ground
looks for eve
she is watching the ship rise into the clouds
waits until it is completely out of sight
then eve rises high up into the air
she flies around the bay
soars like a graceful bird
does loops in the sky
zooms right past wall es rock
he is hypnotized
eve descends gently to the ground
wall e sneaks up closer
hides behind another boulder
makes a noise
instantly eve whips around
her arm converts into a laser cannon
blasts wall es boulder to smithereens
eve now cold and dangerous
scans the area
no sign of life
all business again
hovers away to probe more of the planet
wall e boxed up behind what little remains of the rock
eve wanders through the pillars of cubed trash
scans random areas
wall e spies from the shadows
too frightened to approach
she moves on
eve probes a mound of tires
wall e hiding nearby
he flinches at the sight of innocently approaching eve from behind
she spins around
blasts the insect
wall e is gut punched
the cockroach climbs out of the smoking crater
eve finds the insect intriguing
lowers her arm
the end separates into individual hovering sections
she lets the insect crawl up her arm
wiggles into her workings
giggles wall e relaxes
eve sonically picks up wall es location
locks onto him
arm converts to laser cannon
quick glimpses of wall e dodging the blasts
trash piles are systematically obliterated around him
wall e now exposed
nowhere to hide
boxes himself up
eve holds her fire
electronic hums identify yourself
she slowly approaches wall es box
keeps her gun trained on him
electronic hums repeat
wall e peeks out from his box
doesnt understand a thing she says
cant believe shes real
the cockroach climbs down her gun arm
jumps onto his master
eve scans wall e
a red light appears on her chest
hes not what shes looking for
she retracts her gun arm
wall e watches her go
eve scans through the market
wall e follows from a safe distance
a stray puppy dog
eve glances over at him
wall e panics
bumps into a rack of shopping carts
creates an avalanche
they chase him down a flight of stairs
wall e reaches the exit doors
carts pig pile on top of him
wall e perched on the roof
patiently watches eve fly
she scans the ground below her like a searchlight
eve comes in for a landing below
shuts down for the night
wall e waits
quietly sneaks down the refinery fire escape
tumbles to the ground
eve doesnt wake
wall e creeps up to her
opens his arms wide
and measures her
turns to a pile of trash
splits open his eyes
begins welding something
eve powers up again
does a double take
a trash sculpture of eve stands in front of her
she hovers away unimpressed
doesnt notice wall e hiding behind a pile of pipes
wall e kicks the pipes in frustration
they roll on top of him
scans a car engine
slams the hood shut
scans a port a potty
slams the door shut
scans an apollo capsule
slams the hatch shut
scans a freighter hold
slams the lid shut
eve hovers over the freighter
not finding what shes looking for
wall e eavesdrops from afar
eve flies past the ships crane magnet
wrestles to free herself
furious she blows up the entire ship
the reaction startles wall e
eve slumps down against a dredged anchor
she gives up
concerned wall e cautiously approaches
sits at the other end of the anchor
both robots stare silently at the fiery wreck
slowly very slowly wall e inches towards her
musters the courage to speak when she suddenly turns to him hums so whats your story
wall e falls backwards with surprise
eve scrolls through a variety of languages german directive
beeps oh i understand that
wall e eagerly turns to some nearby trash
scoops it into his compactor
proudly spits out a cube
points to eve
struggles to speak di
wall e nods
she scans his chest logo
struggles again w wally
smooth almost perfect wwww aaaa leee
wall e nearly melts
she says his name so beautifully
wall e tries to repeat it eeee
she giggles again
wall e likes making her giggle
the wind kicks up
the warning light sounds on wall es chest
he moves to grab her
hums hey watch it
dont come any closer
she draws her gun on him
doesnt understand the danger
the sandstorm rushes up behind her
wall e collapses into a box
the storm hits full force
eve is instantly lost disoriented
wall es hand appears out of the dust
calmly takes eves hand
the back door lowers
a rush of wind and sand
wall e pulls eve inside
closes the door
she coughs up dust
wall e hits a switch
strings of christmas lights fill the space
his racks of oddities painted in colored light
an air of enchantment
eve is taken aback
beeps come on in
she drifts through the sea of knickknacks
becomes spooked by a singing billy bass fish
threatens to shoot it but wall e calms her down
he is compelled to show her everything
hands her an eggbeater
bubble wrap so infectious to pop
a lightbulb lights when she holds it
the rubiks cube she solves it immediately
his hello dolly tape
curious she begins unspooling the tape
loud beeps my tape
he grabs it back
inserts it carefully into the vcr
please still work
the movie eventually appears on the tv
plays a clip of poysc
wall e is relieved
beeps what do you think
mimics the dancing for eve
encourages her to try
she clumsily hops up and down
makes dents in the floor
wall e politely stops her
beeps how bout we try a different move
spins in a circle
spins faster and faster
accidentally strikes wall e
he flies into the shelves
eve helps him up from the mess
wall es left binocular eye falls off
dangles from two wires
eve gasps with concern
wall e placates her
beeps its fine
feels his way to the rack of shelves
rotates them until
spare wall e parts appear
replaces his broken eye with a new one
eve is relieved
she eyes his lighter collection
flicks open a zippo
ignites a flame
wall e freezes
he had no idea it could do that
moves closer to inspect it
its the closest hes ever been to eve
she remains focused on the lighter
wall e stares up at her
the tiny flame flickering between them
the hello dolly video plays iotam in the background
suddenly he is moved to express his love
musters the courage to open his fingers
timidly reaches his hand out to hers
eve turns and looks at him
wall e instantly chokes
pulls his hand back
eve becomes intrigued with the tv
scans the image of the lovers singing iotam
wall e watches her
his infatuation still palpable
then he remembers
he rushes to his shelves
eve watches him rummage through junk
a drum falls down on his head
she giggles charmed by it all
something about wall e
she is drawn back to the lovers on tv
then the lit zippo lighter in her hand
a tap on her shoulder
she turns to find wall e holding something
eve immediately locks onto it
drops the lighter
in a flash
her chest opens
a tractor beam snatches the plant away
stores it inside her
then she shuts down completely
only a single green light pulsing on her chest
wall e is stunned
whatd i do
waves his hand in front of her face
knocks on her chest plate
wall e panics
gently shakes her
still no response
camera moves in on the blinking green light
the morning sun
wall e places eve in his charging spot
aims her hovering form to face the sun
several hot days pass with wall e holding vigil in the heat
a thunderstorm approaches on the horizon
wall e holds an umbrella over eve
gets struck by lightning
holds up another umbrella
gets struck again
a sandstorm blows through
wall e pops out of a dune on the trucks roof
lifts up an upside down barrel that protected eve
wall e pries open a panel on eves chest
reveals her pulsing blue heart battery
attaches jumper cables to his own heart battery
tries to connect the other end to hers
an automatic defense system blows him off truck
wall e cockroach take eve for a walk
pull her along on a leash of christmas lights
wall e gives eve a boat ride on a lake of sludge
uses an industrial tire as a boat
rows like a gondolier with a road sign
wall e sits by the empty bay with eve
watches the sunset
burns wall e eve on a public trash can
tries to pull out her hand to hold it
it snaps back into place trapping his hand
wall e has set up the tv on the roof
the blank eve floating next to him
tries unsuccessfully to play pong with her
still no response
finally he gives up
defeated sigh wall e loads up his cooler
checks on eve one more time
heads off to work defeated
wall e simply going through the motions
no spirit in him at all
pulls out the zippo lighter
flicks it a few times
a rush of wind blows out the flame
wall e looks in the direction of his home
a bright glow is lowering down through the clouds
beeps oh no
wall e racing as fast as he can
the cockroach clings onto him for dear life
the recon spaceship towers over his truck
a robot arm cherry picks eve from the roof
lifts her up and into the ships cargo hold
wall e racing in the distance
reaches the end of the collapsed bridge ramp
forced to watch eve disappear into the ship
the cargo doors slam shut
the first of the three rocket engines powers up
wall e heads down a hill of rubble to the ship
notices his cockroach tagging along behind him
leads it back to the top of the hill
the insect mopes
droops its little antennae
wall e motors back down to the rocket
the engines blast a wall of smoke
preparation for launch
eve is secured into a slot
joins a row of other eve probes
only eve flashes a green light
the camera drifts back out a window
where wall e steadily climbs up the side
the ships engines ignite
wall e clamps his hands tight to a metal support
the rocket takes off into space
the cockroach watches his master go
the spaceship roars through the sky
wall e tightens his grip battling the gs
he looks ahead
litter the outer atmosphere
the ship bursts through the layer
the recon ship breaks free of the planet
its boosters shut down
wall e takes in the sudden quietness of space
looks back at his planet
weightlessness takes effect
wall e almost floats away
grabs hold of the ship
knocks on a window near eve
she remains shut down
wall e points out at the stars
it is the most spectacular light show possible
and wall e has a front row seat
the ship flies past the moon
a billboard stands next to the abandoned apollo moon rover
bnl outlet coming soon
the ship passes by the sun
wall e pops open his solar panels
the ship cruises alongside saturns outer rings
wall e runs his hand through the tiny particles of ice
a dumbbell nebula slowly twists in space
wall e is mesmerized by it
leads his eye to a light growing in the distance ahead
gigantic in size
the now tiny recon ship heads straight for it
two tug rockets guide the ship in
it locks into giant braces fixed on the deck
the impact knocks wall e off
he lands in the scaffolding of the front brace
suddenly the entire dock comes to life
robotic arms and service robots of all types appear
rise from the floor
lower from the ceiling
its a cacophony of automation
they all attend to the ship
and four other probes slide out of the ships side
suspended in a horizontal rack
wall e is surprised to find her facing him
she remains shut down
just a few feet away with a giant abyss between them
a squad of cleaner robots emerge onto the dock
a small roller brush bot m o leads
beeps hold up
waits for the floor lines to appear
depict their exact path of action
they file out on the line
a crane bot lowers eve from the rack
m o and his cleaning crew stand ready
m o scans eve
scan reads foreign contaminant
m o is disgusted
revs his brush roller
moves in for the clean
a vacu bot follows after him
then a spray bot and buffer bot finish off
the cleaning crew waits for probe
wall e studies the routine
figures out a way to climb down to eve
when the crane returns wall e poses as probe
the crane grabs him instead
m o turns around to clean the next probe
wall e is lowered in front of him
confused m o scans him
scan reads foreign contaminant
m o is horrified by such filth
a red siren light rises from his head
oh no no no
this is all wrong
he scrubs wall e full force
wall es front panel pushes him away
confused m o moves to clean him again
wall e backs away
leaves a dirt trail
m o curses you made the floor all dirty
m o furiously scrubs the floor
wall e peeks out amused by this neurotic little guy
two steward robots come out of the wall
act like hovering caution signs
a small robot gopher shoots out a pneumatic tube
he bears epaulet like shoulders and a siren for a face
gopher beeps an electronic order for the stewards to follow
m o just finishes cleaning the floor
wall e is fascinated
impishly makes another mark
m o compulsively cleans it
look it stays clean
you got that
wall e wipes the bottom of his tread on m os face
m o loses it
scrubs his own face
gopher and his steward escort arrive
the cleaning crew stand at attention
wall e boxes back up with the probes
gopher begins scanning each probe
moves down the line
scans wall e
moves on to the next probe
stops wait a minute
wall e is gone
gopher shrugs it off
doesnt notice wall e hidden behind her
gopher scans her blinking plant light the entire dock goes to code green
green lights flash
all automation stops
in rapid succession
a hover transport glides up to gopher
a crane bot loads eve
curved energy bands lock her down
gopher assumes the drivers seat
its all moving too fast for wall e
suddenly eves transport heads for the elevator
wall e chases after them
grabs onto the back of the transport
they disappear into the elevator
the cleaning crew files out
follow their lines back to their hold
m o stops short
notices wall es filthy tracks crossing his path
reads foreign contaminant the tracks lead to the elevator
m os neurosis takes over
must clean dirt
he makes a radical decision and
jumps off his line
starts methodically cleaning the dirt trail
gopher waits patiently as the floors pass
wall e hidden behind the transport
peeks at eve
pets her blank faceplate
quiet beeps itll be okay eve
the elevator doors suddenly open
dozens of robots speed along a multi lane passageway
all following glowing lines on the floor
wall es head whipsaws back and forth
tries to process it all
doesnt notice gophers transport merge into traffic
wall e shrinks from the high speed traffic
timidly attempts to merge
sticks out one tread
instantly causes a robot pile up
wall e boxes up
weaves across all the lines on the floor
bounces off robots like bumper cars
barely able to navigate the chaos
takes refuge in the middle of an intersection
scans for eve
a paint bot paints a wall sign
a garbage bot dumps trash into a wall chute
down the hall eves transport glides up a ramp
wall e chases after them
wall e flies up the ramp
nearly collides with a merging hover chair
it blocks his way
wall e gains alongside it and discovers sitting reclined in the chair
he is large round and soft like a big baby
wears a red bnl jumpsuit
the chair seems to be steering itself
guided by floor lines just like the robots
speaker headrests block his peripheral vision
a holographic screen floats inches in front of his face
he converses with a second passenger on screen well ive been in my cabin all morning so lets hover over to the driving range and hit a few virtual balls
nah we did that yesterday
i dont want to do that
well then what do you want to do
he looks over his shoulder
passenger is floating right next to them
isolated in his own hover chair
also in a red jumpsuit
also a big baby
i dont know
both humans are totally unaware of the others presence
they all exit the hallway
merge into the
wall e is in awe
hundreds of floors of guest rooms rise on all sides
thousands of passengers fill the giant space
all reclined and riding on hover chairs
multiple floor lines guide their chairs in all directions
humans have become the most extreme form of couch potatoes
absolutely no reason to ever get up
every one of them engrossed in their video screens
cocooned in virtual worlds
over developed fingers tap armrest keypads
the controls allow them to steer
and most of all
chat mindlessly with other passengers the chatter is deafening
no one notices wall e at all
he drives into the endless human traffic
bot over here
a drink bot floats over to a passenger
puts a fresh drink in her open hand
wall e flows with the traffic into a large tunnel
i cant hear you
im in a tunnel
youre breaking up
i can hear you now
they spill out into the bright light of the a city sized mall like environment
all under a giant dome
the ceiling simulates the sun and sky
a bnl logo w time temp appears on the face of the sun
buy n large
everything you need to be happy
your day is very important to us
wall e is gobsmacked
a passenger john hovers up alongside him
tries to hand off his empty drink cup to wall e
hey drink bot
wall e shies away
john reaches farther out with the cup
here take the cup
take the cup whoa
reaches too far
john falls to the floor
flails like an upside down turtle
unable to stand on his baby legs
wall e watches two stewards arrive
block johns accident
emergency lines appear on the floor
redirect the hover chair traffic
john reaches out for assistance
just drive past
please remain stationary
a service bot will be here to assist you momentarily
suddenly john begins to rise
whats going on
wall e lifting him up from behind
loads him back onto his chair
john doesnt know how to react
wall e waves hello
uh no john
wall e scans the concourse
spots eves transport about to board a monorail
he races after them
abandons the stunned john
small wave bye
it pulls out of the station
wall e leaps on
barely catches the last car
it glides down the concourse
a nanny bot supervises a group of toddlers
all wearing matching bnl onesies
motionless in their hover rings
they stare at educational programming on their holo screens
a is for axiom your home sweet home
b is for buy n large your very best friend
wall es monorail glides past
wall e takes in the overstimulating scenery
dozens of themed food restaurants whizz by
each specialty is served in the same jumbo plastic cup
time for lunch in a cup
wall e now notices his fellow passengers
they all slurp from similar cups
next the monorail passes a beauty salon
beautician bots primp and style passengers
pre recorded lines its the new you
you look great
i know honey
they pass through the fashion district
enormous billboards hawk the latest color schemes
attention axiom shoppers
its the new red
passengers next to wall e press their chair buttons
their jumpsuits change from red to blue
their monorail speeds into a glass tunnel
wall e looks past a passenger mary next to him
spots eve on the other side
wall e tries to sneak behind mary
but her chair moves backwards
smashes wall e against the back wall
no way getting past her
wall e politely tries to get marys attention
chats incessantly on her holo screen date
derisive snort dont get me started
every holo date ive been on has been a virtual disaster
if i could just meet one who wasnt so superficial
there are no good men out there
wall e tries to fold back her speaker headrest
accidentally breaks it off
i know cause ive scrolled through them all gasp what the
marys chair shorts out
holo screen shuts off
jumpsuit defaults back to red
for the first time mary has an unobstructed view
her eyes slowly dilate
its as if shes seeing the world for the first time
her gaze falls on wall e
he waves politely
beat m mary
he points to eve on the other side of mary
gestures hed like to get by
she is slow to understand
oh uh sure go ahead
mary moves her hover chair back
wall e rolls over to eve
pats her protectively
the monorail emerges into first class
a vast circular plaza of pools
surrounded by a ring of high rise apartments
hundreds of passengers lounge poolside
all serviced by their personal umbrella bots
claps umbrella bot opens shade
it stops at the bridge plaza
the base of the axioms bridge tower
the passengers exit
follow their respective lines
gopher drives eve and wall e towards the tower
pass over a giant bnl logo on the plaza floor
she is the last to exit the car
doesnt follow any lines
excited by her newfound awareness
looks out on the lido deck as the monorail pulls away
i didnt know we had a pool
eves transport enters the cavernous hall
a lone typing bot is stationed at the far end
a bridge elevator behind him
blocked by a force field gate
the transport pulls up to the typing bot
the typing bot responds by typing
finally the gate lowers
elevator doors open
the typing bot watches the transport enter the elevator
notices wall e hiding at the back
wall e gives it a friendly wave as the doors close
the elevator shoots up to the bridge
the typing bot looks at its hand
mimics wall es waving gesture
never done that before
tries it some more
wall e looks out on the descending lido deck
marvels at it all
his view suddenly goes dark
the elevator doors open on
the large circular room is dimly lit
windows to space on one side a lido deck view on the other
a massive console wraps around its entirety
covered in buttons
a sea of thinking lights
a captains wheel automatically steers
gopher drives into the middle of the room
suddenly the wheel disengages
the autopilot auto
a single camera eye lights up its center
a periscope stem connects auto to the ceiling
slides along rails up to gopher who salutes
auto eyes eve
wall e sneaks back into the shadows
auto detects eves plant light
begins computing rapidly
the number a flashes on his lens
an electronic exchange begins between auto and gopher
wall e watches the interchange
without warning auto heads in his direction
wall e boxes up
a circular section of floor lights directly below him
irises open like a trapdoor
wall e drops
and hits the floor hard in the room below
someone stirs then resumes snoring
auto lowers through the portal
a clock alarm buzzer activates
you are needed on the bridge
shoots back up
the portal closes
wall e peeks out of his box
pan across the nautical themed cabin
one wall lined with portraits of former captains
their years of service listed below
the autopilot in the background of each picture
each generation of captain more devolved than the other
from human to gelatinous blob
we stop on the final portrait
a blobby captain
it looms above the actual captain snoring in bed
he reaches out in his sleep to quiet the snooze alarm
smacks wall es box by mistake
activates the poysc sample
it plays loud
the captain sits straight up half awake all hands on deck
wall e is frantic to turn off the music as
prep robots burst from the cabinetry
a beautician bot massage bot and wardrobe bot
the captains bed automatically raises
forms into a hover chair
the robots rapidly massage brush primp and dress him
pre recorded morning
just a trim
wall e blends in with the primping
uselessly wiggles the captains toes
giggles lines light on the floor
lead his chair automatically to the elevator
wall e sneaks aboard just as the doors close
elevator doors swish open
the captain still half asleep
claps his hands twice
on cue a coffee maker rises from the console
pours a cup
classical music plays on overhead speakers
the captains chair links with a lit floor path
leads him over to the coffee
wall e stays lockstep behind him
auto glides over to the captain
wall e hides under the console just in time
the captain reaches for his coffee
makes a minimal effort
easier to adjust his chairback slowly forward
he grabs the coffee
sir the annual the captain gives auto the hand
sips his coffee
first things first
to the room computer status report
his chair automatically arcs along the console
specific panels light up as he passes
sips coffee unchanged
regenerative food unchanged
jacuzzi ph balance
laundry service volume
he eyes eve on the transport across the room
has to get to her
but auto is right above him
auto calls up a screen on the console
displays the recon ship and a flashing positive probe
waits patiently for the captain to notice
finally the captain turns
sir the annual reconnaissance has but then notices the time
disappointed sigh auto why didnt you wake me for the morning announcements
he slingshots his chair to the lido deck side of the bridge
wall e nearly collides with him
ducks back under the console
honestly its the one thing i get to do on this ship
grabs a large dial
time of day icons surround it
cranks it from mid day back to sunrise
the fake noon sun reverses at high speed to a sunrise
passengers lunch cups switch to breakfast cups
poolside passengers umbrella bots close up
an announcement whistle blows over the intercom
a section of sky dome becomes a jumbotron screen
displays a live video feed of the captain
the image also shows up on every passengers chair screen
unmotivated well good morning everybody and welcome to day aboard the axiom
as always weathers a balmy degrees and sunny and oh hey i see the ships log is showing that today is our th anniversary of our five year cruise
well im sure our forefathers would be proud to know that years later wed be
deflates doing the exact same thing
they were doing
cut to various aspects of axiom living
the listening passengers look just as bored as the captain
snaps out of ennui so
be sure next mealtime to ask for your free
hard to pronounce septuacentennial cupcake in a cup
also today we have uh
hey auto whats that flashing button
mic feedback whine the captain stares at a flashing button on the console
it bears the same plant icon as eves display
the captain turns to auto
for the first time he notices eve
auto hovers over her
probe one has returned positive
auto re activates eve
rises to salute the captain
across the room wall e watches with sheer joy
he is compelled to head straight for her
no probes ever come back positive
looks at flashing button before
the flashing button is practically calling to him
instantly shades close on all the windows
the room goes dark
wall e is forced to hide under the console again
a large holo screen appears right above him
pre recorded footage of the bnl ceo plays greetings and congratulations captain
if youre seeing this that means your extraterrestrial vegetation evaluator or
air quotes eve probe has returned from earth with a confirmed specimen of ongoing photosynthesis
the captain stares slack jawed at the screen
wall e sneaks under the console towards eve
thats right it means its time to go back home
w w were going back
now that earth has been restored to a life sustaining status by golly we can begin operation recolonize
a section of the console illuminates
an ancient dusty manual slides out
into a passing wall es hands
wall e immediately boxes up
holds the manual over his head
the captain mistakes wall e for a book podium
grabs the manual
blows dust off the cover
it reads operation recolonize
below the title the same plant icon from eves display
simply follow this manuals instructions to place the plant in your ships holo detector and the bad edit axiom will immediately navigate your return to earth
its that easy
an animated diagram depicts a stage below the ships bridge
the symbol of a holo detector rises up
a stick figure places a plant inside the machine
a starliner icon flies back towards earth
the captain listens closely to the instructions
wall e paying attention as well
wall e notices he has a clear shot to eve
heads in her direction
now due to the effects of micro gravity you and your passengers may have suffered some slight bone loss
but im sure a few laps around your ships jogging track will get you back in shape in no time
the captain looks at his vestigial legs
we have a jogging track
if you have any further questions just consult your operation manual
see you back home real soon
the transmission ends
the captain examines the manual
holds it out in front of him
reads to himself operate
aloud cautious manuel relay instructions
clips the corner of the cover with his handle
and simply opens the book
the captain is both fascinated and intimidated
lifts the cover with his own fingers
will you look at that
wall e taps her shoulder
not now wall e double take
tiny wave ee vah
eve is in a state of disbelief
shoves wall e into the shadows under the console
hushed angry wall e what are you doing here
you cant be here
youre going to get me in trouble
makes a flurry of clandestine gestures at him
wall e just stares at her
swoons ee vah
he manages to turn to the first page of instructions
reads aloud well lets open her up
voice command confirm acquisition
the bridge suddenly jumps to life
green lights flash
a large device appears from the ceiling
scans the entire room
rides along the ceiling rails
stations itself directly above eve
a voice arm swings into the captains face voice authorization required
a button pushing arm lowers
presses a sequence of buttons on eve
her chest lights up
the doors open
the captain winces
and nothing is inside
wheres the thingie
where is it
checks manual maybe we missed a step
show me how you change the text again
auto and the captain turn away
re read the manual
eve is stunned
searches her chest cavity for the plant
then she remembers
turns on him wall e
wall e flinches
surprised by her anger
eve opens wall es chest
picks him up
scans the floor
angry electronics find it
wall e scared of her
why dont you scan her to be sure
eve jumps back to attention
auto slides up to her
scans her chest cavity
contains no specimen
probes memory is faulty
were not going to earth
shakes his wheel negative
so uh i guess things go back to normal huh
privately relieved well false alarm
instantly the plant retrieval device retracts
exits back into the ceiling
the shades rise
lights go back on
the probe must be defective
gopher send her to the repair ward
gopher hops to attention
traps eve in his suspension beam
loads her back onto the transport
have them run diagnostics on her
make sure shes not malfunctioning eeyah
and reveals wall e
everyone stares at him
long awkward pause
wall e innocently motors over to the captain
shakes his hand
leaves a clump of dirt in his palm
the captain stares at it
turns to auto
have wall e cleaned
the elevator opens
gophers transport drives out
both eve and wall e strapped on it with energy bands
the typing bot has now mastered waving
waves an enthusiastic goodbye
wall e tries to get eves attention
she gives him the cold shoulder
refuses to speak to him
wall e shrinks
the transport exits the lobby
the clump of dirt is suspended in a beam of light
the captain sits at his vanity console
analysis data scrolls on a holo screen
analysis foreign contaminant
substance is a three phase system composed of various combinations of naturally derived solids
subject is most commonly referred to as soil dirt or earth
the last word piques his interest
his eyes drift to a globe on his shelf
earth the surface of the world as distinct from the sky or sea
dozens of images of land pop up on screen
lush green colorful inviting
takes it all in
through the window we see the captain
glued to his screen
filled with ocean images
an expanse of salt water that covers most of the earths surface and surrounds its land masses
the camera drifts away from the window
moves aft to the axioms stern
m o continues to clean wall es filthy trail
oblivious to everything around him
cuts through traffic
robots crash into each other in his wake
m o doesnt notice eve and wall es transport drive past
they hover down a corridor and enter
its a fully automated clinic for broken bots
day care for the malfunctioned
the rejects are kept in force field pens
dozens line the walls
eve and wall e stop at the inspection station
robotic orderly arms activate
wall e shrinks
watches them systematically check in eve
perform an i
attach a red defect boot to her head
a button is pressed on the boot
eve goes into sleep mode
lifted off the transport
beeps where are you going
the orderly arms now start on wall e
he escapes before they can place a defect boot on him
races through the ward
wall e runs smack into a defective beautician bot
pre recorded just a trim
she paints wall es face with hideous looking make up
holds up a mirror
wall e gasps
you look gorgeous
wall e is snatched up by an orderly arm
placed in an empty force field pen
sits between a paint bot and vacu bot the broken paint bot flings paint at wall e
the vacu bot sneezes dust in his face
across the way a massage bot flails wildly
orderly arms restrain him with an energy straightjacket
eve slides past wall e
carried by an orderly arm
brought into the diagnostics room
the frosted glass doors shut
orderly arms run diagnostics on a few reject robots an umbrella bot flips open and overextends
the orderly arms struggle to close it
a defibrillator bot shocks a crash test dummy
it bursts into flames
eve is awoken from sleep mode
a series of tests begin
eve is annoyed but calm
its all routine
an orderly arm easily detaches her gun arm
wall e stares at the frosted glass doors
can only make out eves silhouette
to him her arm is being ripped off
the orderly arm tests eves circuitry
her insides light up
next to her the umbrella bots mechanism screeches
wall e watches in horror
it looks as if eve is being tortured
mistakes the screeching for her screams
wall e struggles to free himself
she is washed and scrubbed
a circular buffer cleans between her head and body
it feels good
it looks as if eve is being beheaded
he needs to stop the torture
wall e fires his cutting laser at his pens force field
the barrier shorts out
wall e tumbles to the floor
lands on his play button
poysc blares across the ward
the rejects all stop and stare
wall e races to the diagnostics room
crashes right through the glass doors
finds eve surrounded by orderly arms
grabs eves separated gun arm
points it at the orderly arms
angry beeps let her go or ill shoot
his hands tremble don knotts style
hes holding the gun backwards
eve slowly reaches for the weapon
put the gun down
an orderly lunges at him
wall e panics
the gun fires backwards
it blasts through the repair ward
blows up the repair ward control panel
wall e shrinks
he knows hes in trouble
the smoking remains of the control panel short circuit
all orderly arms go limp
the repair ward doors open up
and all force fields disappear
the rejects look at each other for a beat
then cheer wildly
the mob of robots all rush wall e
lift him on their shoulders
carry their hero out of the ward
wall e still holding on to eves gun arm
eve watches in astonishment
this day just gets worse and worse
she flies off after them
the rejects march wall e out the entrance
their red defect boots all blink
activate a warning light above the doorway
emergency lights blinking
activate an embedded row of stewards
they pop out of the wall
race to the repair ward
the reject mob stampedes through the halls
disrupts all robot traffic
wall e carried over their heads
suddenly the mob stops in front of
a blockade of stewards
wall es dropped in front of them
still holds eves gun
a tiny robot pushes wall e closer
show em whos boss
stern wall e
eve catches up to them
flies over to wall e
snatches her arm back
just as she reattaches her gun
the steward camera eyes take a snapshot of them
screens appear displaying eve and wall es image
she appears to brandish her gun at camera
like bonnie and clyde
their faces now on every wall
passengers hover chair
caution rogue robots
caution rogue robots
the stewards prepare to fire suspension beams like gopher
eve realizes whats about to happen
grabs wall e
flies over the stewards
the mass of rejects take their cue
they bust through the steward blockade
robots recognize eve and wall e as they fly past
match them with the wanted screens
call attention to them
stewards in hot pursuit
eve hides herself and wall e in a porthole cubby
lets the stewards pass by
she glances out the porthole
she can see the docking bay below her
just under the bay doors
a row of emergency escape pods
eve gets an idea
grabs wall e and flies down the hallway
eve and wall e ride in uncomfortable silence
their wanted image plays on an elevator screen
caution rogue robots
wall e points to it
beeps hey look
were on tv
eve aims her gun at the screen
blows it to pieces
wall e shrinks into a box
the elevator chimes
eve and wall e step out
rows of numbered bay doors line the hallway
eve approaches bay
she and wall e enter
eve navigates the dark
approaches a freestanding console
fiddles with some buttons
he glances down at eves hand
privately intertwines his fingers
maybe now is the right moment
quiet ee vah
banks of controls light up around them
is revealed at the end of the room
its hatch automatically opens
bathes the room with light from its lit interior
eve turns to wall e earth
she points to an overhead screen
it displays coordinates to earth
she gestures for wall e to enter the pod
he happily complies
jumps up on one of the seats
pats the seat next to him
arent you coming
eve remains at the threshold
shakes her head
points to her chest
makes her plant symbol glow
shes not going
this changes everything
wall e races out of the pod
beeps then im not going either
eve shakes her head
gentle but firm wall e
carries his box back into the pod
wall e follows her right back out
drives behind the console
you cant make me
frustrated wall e
the hallway elevator chimes
they both look up
someone is coming
eve shuts off everything
lights go out
the pod closes back up
both eve and wall e hug the wall
blend in with the other wall fixtures
they hear something hover into the room
cant see what it is
an epaulet robot arm rises up over the console
the pod lights up again
the hatch opens
the strangers shadow comes around the console to reveal
eve and wall e look at each other
they watch from the shadows as
gopher enters the pod
opens his chest cavity
emits his suspension beam
and deposits the plant
excited whisper plant
gopher exits the pod
she keeps her eyes on gopher
watches him return to the console
she turns to speak to wall e
whisper wall e
wall e is inside the pod
picks up the plant
proudly shows it to eve
loud whisper ee vah
louder whisper wall e
gopher hits a button
the pod door shuts on wall e
and launches into space
gopher shuts off the room
eve leaps out of the shadows
looks out the pod bay window
wall es pod rapidly shrinking in the distance
the plant icon on eves chest glows
she rushes to a narrow service airlock
enters it like a phone booth
eve bursts out into space
rockets after wall e
wall e plastered against the back of the pod
it suddenly reduces speed
he drops to the floor
you are now free to move around the cabin
wall e fumbles to get his bearings
peers out the rear hatch window
sees the axiom receding from view
he clambers up into the pilots seat
pulls back hard on the throttle
looks down at the console
a self destruct dial is counting down twenty seconds till self destruct
wall e frantically hits the self destruct button
pushes every button on the console
everything activates lights flash
oxygen masks drop
windshield wipers activate
flares fire off
ten seconds till self destruct
wall e panics
looks for a means of escape
spots the hatch
grabs the pods fire extinguisher
shoots himself to the door
ten nine eight seven six five four three two
pulls on the emergency exit lever
the hatch wont open
she races through space after him
suddenly in the distance the pod explodes
eve is gut punched
no no no
she flies towards the debris field when wall e whizzes right past her
he holds the fire extinguisher
uses it as a form of propulsion
eve is consumed with relief
chases after him
he points the extinguisher the other way
attempts to fly back over to her
its hard to steer
they rocket right past each other again
beeps stay there
ill come to you
wall e finally has the hang of steering
fires short bursts
makes his way
gets extinguisher foam in her face
look what ive got ee vah
he opens his compactor door
pulls out the plant still in the boot
sensors zero in on the plant
confirm its authenticity
a map of the axiom appears
draws directions to the bridge
a command flashes deliver to axiom superior
eve is ecstatic
she snaps the plant up with her tractor beam
seals it safely in her chest
then scoops up wall e in her arms
spins him around
laughs wall e cant believe his luck
rests his head on her shoulder
eve stops spinning
leans her head against his
a tiny arc of electricity passes between them
a thank you kiss
wall es meter spikes
he floats circles in space
swoons hums come on
times a wastin
she reaches for his hand
wall e shakes his head
holds up his extinguisher instead
beeps i can fly myself
kicks on the extinguisher
spins in a pirouette
and flies away
chases after him
the two fly around the stern of the ship
wall e does a few barrel rolls
beeps try that
matches him move for move
the pair fly between the booster engines of the ship
weave in and out of the rocket flames
bank up along the ships port side
execute a double helix in perfect unison
passengers hover down the hallway
all focused on their private screens
no one looks out at the stars
except for mary
she has pulled over to the side
stares wistfully out the deck window
sigh so many stars
spots eve wall e dancing among the stars
recognizes wall e hey thats whats his name she backs up to wave hello
bumps into johns hover chair
what the mary leans over to his armrest
turns off his holo screen
points out the window
look at that
wall e flies past the window
a wave of recognition hits john
he comes to life as if wakened from a long sleep
i know that guy
snaps fingers wall e
hey wall e
its your buddy john
right wall e
hi wall e
they both wave until wall es out of sight
john absentmindedly lowers his hand to his armrest
and touches marys hand
both turn towards each other
they make eye contact for the first time
they soar across the axioms bow
auto busy operating the ship
doesnt see eve and wall e outside the window
auto turns the sky dial from day to night
the sky dome fast forwards to evening
pan over to the top of the bridge tower
the windows of the captains quarters are dark
only the flickering glow of a holo screen lights the room
define hoe down
the captain is still engrossed in his earth research
multiple images litter the screen
crops farms a barn etc
an image of people square dancing pops up
hoedown a social gathering at which lively dancing would take place
an aperture opens in the ceiling above
auto lowers down to face the captain
earth is amazing
points to images these are called farms
humans would put seeds in the ground pour water on them and theyd grow food like pizza auto shuts off the holo screen
good night captain
annoyed grunt auto rises back up to the bridge
the aperture shuts
the captain glares at the ceiling
then whispers conspiratorially to the computer
the holo screen lights up define dancing
eve and wall e descend along the starboard side
spiral gracefully around one another
dancing a series of movements involving two partners where speed and rhythm match harmoniously with music
wall es extinguisher runs out of foam
he lets it float freely out into space
eve catches him in her arms
wall e croons
eve scans the axiom for a way in
down on the ships lower hull
a repair bot burn e welds an antenna
eve and wall e fly into the open hatch behind him
burn e bangs on the closed door
let me in
let me in
looks around crap
the lido deck is now closing
the lido deck is now closing
the last few passengers exit the pool area
all wearing the same color blue uniforms
except two red ones still in the pool
they ripple the surface of the pool
john and mary float over the waters surface
splash one another playfully
make me giggles
i didnt know we had a pool
a lifeguard bot glorified megaphone lowers from its tower
reprimands them from the pools edge no splashing no diving
john splashes the robot
it shorts out
eve and wall e sneak onto the deck
hide between a row of towel carts
eve peeks through the towels
surprised to discover two stewards
on duty in front of the bridge lobby entrance
no way in
a trash bot passes
dumps its load down a nearby trash chute
eve keys in on the chute
it runs all the way up the tower
to the bridge
he stares at eves hand
time to seize the moment
hits the play button on his chest
it only takes a moment plays from his scratchy speaker
puts his hands together
eve whips around
whats that noise
wall e holds his hands up to eve
e vah eve immediately shuts off his music
shoves his hands down
hushed hums stop it
theyll hear us
she places a stack of towels on his head
gestures for wall e to stay put
points to her plant light
before wall e can even protest she is gone
zooms silently across the lido deck
up into the trash chute
it sits in space
the axiom glides towards it
somethings not right
we reveal the captains fingers holding the ship
the captain sits by his window to space
holds a toy axiom model over his globe of earth
rocket noises prepare for landing
landing noises were here everybody
crowd cheers captain were home
its so beautiful
no its nothing
i was pleased to do it
its all about you people noises
eve bursts out from it like an angel
blows the lid off
the captain is stunned by this vision
she opens her chest to reveal
howd you find it
eve hovers over to him
formally presents him the plant
he takes it in his hands
still potted in the old boot
gazes at it in wonder
we can go back home
for the first time
laughs whats it like now
doesnt know how to answer
dont tell me
i want to see for myself
he turns to his console
hits a button
a cylindrical device rises from a panel
the captain sticks it to the side of eves head
a holographic screen projects from the device
plays back images of her time on earth
a collage of images rapidly scroll past
all displayed from eves pov being delivered to earth
flying above the devastated landscape
blowing up a rock
scans of numerous trash locations
that doesnt look like earth
wheres the blue sky
he looks over to his computer screen
the beauty images of earth still on display
compares them with what plays on eves screen
wheres the grass
his face drops
slumps in defeat
the dream is over
the hello dolly clip of poysc plays
it stirs the captain out of his funk
he looks up at the screen
leans in for a closer look
i know that song
observes the dancers feet and theyre
a rueful smile grows on his face
he looks down at its tapping in time to the music
his gaze drifts over to the plant in his hands
he lifts it up
makes the boot dance
you made it somehow eh little guy
you didnt give up did you
as if in response the plant wilts slightly
a leaf drops
oh no no remembers wait a minute
the captain urgently hovers across the room
eve left alone
her recorded memories continue playing
the clip changes to it only takes a moment
eve recognizes the music
watches the lovers on screen hold hands
something familiar about the gesture
looks at her own hands
slowly she interlocks her fingers
eves eyes go wide
this is what wall e was trying to say to her
her memories continue on the screen a tap on the shoulder
wall e presents her the plant the screen goes black
security camera footage initiates
wall es vigil for eve plays out protecting her from the rain
keeping watch night and day
trying to jump start her heart
amazed at wall es selfless dedication to her
realizes the meaning of wall es love
soft wall e
she looks at her hands again
still waiting between the towel racks
rehearses holding out his hand to eve
gives up beeps ill never get it right
sneaks his way over to the garbage chute
sticks his head in
the chute has an endless drop
wall e climbs in
holds himself spread eagle to stay in place
carefully inches his way up to the captains quarters
a monorail pulls up
m o steps off
still hot on wall es trail
scrubs the dirty tracks towards the bridge lobby
then notices wall es fresh tracks
leading to the trash chute
beeps ah hah
the captain at his wet bar
waters the plant in the sink
there you go little guy
you came a long way for a drink of water
just needed someone to look after you thats all he is struck with a notion
stares out the window at space for a beat
sees his reflection holding the plant
glances at his earth globe
to himself we have to go back
activates his chairs call button
auto come down here
aye aye sir
eve is still watching wall es vigil on the screen playing pong
wall e etches their names in a heart
eve is lost in the moments
smitten wall e
remembers wall e
hes still waiting for her
she turns to leave and finds lowering in front of her
auto spots the plant in the captains hand
a flashes on autos lens
auto eve found the plant
fire up the holo detector
not necessary captain
you may give it to me
not listening you know what
i should do it myself
heads for the elevator
auto shoots back upstairs
pops out another aperture in front of the elevator
blocks the captain
sir i insist you give me the plant
auto get out of my way
sir we cannot go home
what are you talking about
that is classified
captain give me the plant
holds plant out of reach what do you mean classified
you dont keep secrets from the captain
give me the plant
tell me whats classified
tell me auto
thats an order
its a stare down
aye aye sir
auto rises back into the ceiling
lowers down over the vanity console
high speed button pushing
a new bnl video message appears
labeled top secret for autopilot eye only
the bnl fanfare plays
cut to the bnl ceo at the podium
wears an emergency oxygen vest
the fanfare plays too long
just cut it off will ya
music stops forced chuckle hey there autopilots
uh got some bad news
operation cleanup has uh well
wouldnt you know rising toxicity levels have made life unsustainable on earth
darn it all were going to have to cancel operation recolonize
dons his life vest so just uh
just stay the course
rather than try to fix this problem itll just be easier if everyone remains in space
president sir its time to go
im giving override directive a
go to full autopilot
take control of everything
and do not return to earth
ready to run repeat
do not return to earth
throws on his gas mask to camera crew now lets get the heck out of here
the ceo races out of the room
the message cuts out
auto turns to face the captain
the captain shakes his head in disgust
now the plant
no wait a minute
computer when was that message sent to the axiom
the paused image on the holo screen highlights
data begins to calculate on the screen
we see years scroll rapidly backwards
it stops on
message received in the year
thats thats nearly years ago
auto things have changed
weve got to go back
sir orders are do not return to earth
but life is sustainable now
look at this plant green and growing
its living proof he was wrong
its completely relevant
points out to space out there is our home
and its in trouble
i cant just sit here and
thats all ive done
thats all anyone on this blasted ship has ever done
on the axiom you will survive
must follow my directive
the captain turns away in frustration
his eyes catch sight of the captain portraits
notices auto in every one of them
looking over all their shoulders
a little closer every generation
the captain slowly looks over his shoulder
and auto is right behind him
the captain looks at the plant in his lap
his countenance grows determined
he rights his hat
turns to face auto
and gives the most authoritative order of his career im the captain of the axiom
we are going home today
auto slides into his face
makes the captain flinch
no more mr
auto emits an electronic command
shoots out of a pneumatic tube
eve immediately remembers him from the pod bay
she beeps a warning to the captain
gopher activates his suspension beam
snatches the plant away from the captain
thats my plant
this is mutiny
to eve eve arrest him
eve draws her gun arm
points it at gopher
the robot raises his epaulet arms
she opens her chest cavity
motions for gopher to put the plant inside her
eve you are to put this plant straight in the holo detector
gopher slowly advances towards eve
but then tosses the plant across the room
down the trash chute
hums oh no
the plant is gone
but in that frozen moment
the plant suddenly reappears
rises like a ghost up from the chute
wall es head follows
unawares of the plant resting on his head
wall e straddles the top of the lip chute
the plant drops onto his chest
wall e looks at it with surprise
beeps hey the plant
wall e is slow to understand
finally picks up the plant
anticipates to throw it when
auto lowers right in front of him trying to block
give me the plant
eve moves to help wall e
but gopher traps her in his suspension beam
wall e dodges autos multi arm advances
defiantly tosses the plant into his chest
slams it shut
beeps you cant have it
auto flips open one of his handles
produces a taser
and electrocutes wall e
wall es chest circuitry blows out
then drops lifelessly down the chute
gopher floats her trapped form over to auto
the button on her defect boot is pressed
she shuts down
gophers ray holds eve over the opening
drops her down the chute
she bangs against the sides as she tumbles
gopher salutes auto and exits
auto turns to the captain
he is in shock
all communications are terminated
you are confined to quarters
the power shuts off in the room
auto rises back up through the ceiling
the captain looks up
shakes his fist in fury
the aperture closes to black
the word reboot suddenly flashes
her view comes into focus
eve lies in a seemingly endless warehouse of trash
trash slime and robot parts everywhere
piles dumped from a variety of ceiling chutes
eve looks down
computer mice crawl over her
one of them has crawled over her reboot button
switched her back on
a warning alarm sounds
eve spots a platform loaded with giant trash cubes
it slides into an airlock
inner shield doors lock and seal
caution activating airlock disposal
activating airlock disposal
the exterior hatch flies open
the vacuum of space instantly sucks out the cubed trash
eve begins to panic
calls out again wall e
suddenly her area is flooded in light
she flinches at the sight of
as they rumble up behind her
headlights for eyes
they bear a slight resemblance to wall e
wall a emblazoned on their fronts
each grab a ton of trash at once
eve is swept up with the junk
spit it out
eve now trapped in the side of a giant cube
her cube is picked up
transported to a waiting platform
stacked with other massive cubes
wall e trapped in the cube next to her
not doing well
again the alarms kick in
the platform slides on rails
across the safety line
into the airlock
the inner shield doors begin to close
eve needs to act fast
her gun arm stuck inside the cube
struggles to activate it
blasts herself free
flies over to wall e
hes stuck deep in the cube
m o suddenly drops from a ceiling chute
lands in a pile of trash
covered with filth
piles of trash everywhere
the airlock doors closing in the distance
zooms in and locks on wall e
his screen reads foreign contaminant
beeps i have you now
m o speeds towards the airlock
tugs on wall e
desperate to free him
hes slow to pull loose
the gap in the doors narrows
eves never going to make it
racing towards the doors
hes almost at the airlock
the doors slam tight against his roller arms
m o is stuck
the exterior hatch opens eve yanks wall e free
the trash flies out into space
she flies against the force
fights to reach m o
grabs onto his roller
the wall as notice m o stuck in the door
slam the emergency shut off button for the airlock
the exterior hatch closes
eve and wall e fall to the ground in a heap
m o still stuck in the door
shaking uncontrollably with fear
the wall as light up a small work space
eve props wall e up against some trash
hes barely functioning
fades in and out of consciousness
just his red warning light flashes on his meter
eve gently opens his chest cavity
examines the damage
carefully pulls out his circuit board
she flies off into the depot
searches for a new circuit board
m o dutifully cleaning wall e
his display pov reads all clean
m o closes up
wall e feebly offers his hand in gratitude
weak wall e
m o stares at the filthy hand
they sit in awkward silence for a beat
eve returns with found circuit boards
shows each one to wall e
will any of these work
he shakes his head with a frail no
wall e opens his compactor
pulls out the plant
eve holds the plant
her return to axiom superior flashes in her display
she considers it for a moment
then tosses the plant to the floor
i dont care about the plant anymore
she holds her hand out to him
wall e struggles to lift his hand to eves
he reaches out
and bats her hand away
wall e pushes past her
crawls over to the discarded plant
gives it back to eve
eve cant make out what he is saying
wall e fumbles around his box
the zippo lighter
eve stares at the flame
wall e nods
he moves his binocular eyes up and down
like the time he fixed his broken eye
you can fix me eve
with spare parts in my truck
the truck that is back on
her eyes light up
no time to lose
she scoops him up
m o rushes over to wall e
hangs onto his igloo latch with his roller
eve raises her gun arm
blasts a hole in the ceiling
takes off with the two of them
up through the garbage chute
the wall as wave goodbye
a steward moves down the hall
scans for rogue robots
eve and wall es warning image on his display screen
he stops in front of
painted haphazardly on the floor
follows it to a storage closet door
the steward opens the closet
inside a paint bot hides his head in the corner
the yellow line leads straight to his rear brush
the steward apprehends him with his suspension beam
suddenly everything begins to shake
the steward looks around confused
a jet engine noise builds
seems to be coming from
the hallway trash chute
eve wall e m o burst out from it
the paint bot recognizes wall e
beeps the poysc song
our savior has arrived
the stewards alarm goes haywire
he takes a snapshot eve holding wall e holding the plant
and eve is aiming her gun straight at camera
the terrified steward is thrown in
we are currently having technical difficul
eve locks the door on him
the trio take off down the hall
the freed paint bot gives chase
cheers poysc as he follows
wall e only half functioning gets an idea
presses his play button
poysc blares through the hallway
rejects come out of hiding as they hear the music
parade after eve and wall e
all following the pied piper
eve and wall es wanted image instantly circulates
alert screens pop up around the sleeping ship
caution rogue robots
caution rogue robots
auto observes the same wanted image
raises a screen showing a deck plan of the axiom
it highlights eve and wall es location
auto activates every steward on the axiom
stewards eject from their wall stations
like atms jumping to life
race in the direction of eve
carelessly knock over stray passengers in their way
caution rogue robots
auto watches the deck plan display
monitors the progress of all the stewards
the camera drops through the floor down to
the captain still trapped
rams his hover chair against the locked elevator door
has no effect
hoarse exhausted mutinyyy
this is your last chance
you hear me
caution rogue robots
caution rogue robots
a flashing light catches his attention
outside his window
he looks up on the sky dome
a giant wanted image of eve and wall e holding
the captains eyes light up
glances down at the open manual on the floor
plant icon holo detector icon earth he is filled with renewed determination
laughs well see whos powerless now
lays flat in his chair
floats under his vanity console like a grease monkey
pulls off the underside panel
yanks out a bundle of wiring
cross connects two wires
the console powers up
eve zooms through the hallways
a band of rejects track behind them
they reach an intersection when
the captains face appears on holo screens all around them
is this thing on
all screens display the captains live feed
hes absolutely everywhere
a few stray passengers are still up
watch their screens in confusion
auto watches the captain on the holo screen
furiously tries to shut off the intercom
this is the captain im locked in my room
eve wall e bring the plant to the lido deck
ill have activated the holo detector
autos probably going to cut me off the screens all go dead
eve and wall e look at each other with determination
theyre about to continue on when
a wall of stewards block their path
dozens of them stand in a row
eve fires her gun
destroys a steward
another one quickly takes its place
traps her arm with its suspension beam
she cant shoot
the stewards advance when suddenly
the rejects charge the stewards the beautician bot deflects rays with her mirrors
the vacu bot sneezes dust in their faces
the defib bot shocks them with her paddles
the umbrella bot opens up
shields the others from the attack
a weak wall e activates his welding beam
shorts out the massage bots energy straightjacket
it goes berserk
leaps at the entire army of stewards
robot parts fly everywhere
eve and wall e cant watch the carnage
he sets eves cylindrical device on the floor behind him
it projects her stored memories
auto watches steward blips disappear from his screen
a message screen pops up
its the captain
and hes holding the plant
look what i got auto
autos single lens irises wide
oh you want it
come and get it blinky
the captain hovers in front of eves memory screen
it projects a still image of wall e holding the plant
the captain blocks the cameras view of wall e
pretends to be holding the projected plant himself
hears auto coming
turns off the vid com
yanks his bundle of wires out of the wall
the room goes dark again
the aperture opens
auto lowers into the dark
cautiously searches the empty room
pans across the portraits of other captains
past our present captain
the eyes in the portrait dart nervously
wait a minute
the captain lunges at him
grabs auto by the steering wheel
hangs onto it like capn ahab in a gale
his lower extremities of no use
zips back up through the hole in the ceiling
the captain gets stuck between floors
what too heavy for ya huh
auto tries to pull free
the captain wont let go
auto ends up yanking him through
the captain rides auto like a bucking bronco
auto swings violently back and forth
youre not getting away from me one eye
is that all you got
gopher drops out of his pneumatic tube
sees the captain fighting auto
charges at the captain
who kicks him straight out the window
his shadow growing over the pool
and smashes in a heap on the cement
we pan over the smoking wreckage of the stewards
the massage bot floats above it all
pants like a wild beast
one steward still twitches
the massage bot crushes him with one blow
eve grabs wall e and the plant
they take off for the concourse level
m o and the rejects follow behind
a little closer
the captain reaches his one free hand out for
the holo detector button
his hand slams down hard on it
klaxons sound all over the ship
floodlights kick on everywhere
the lido deck pools automatically cover up
stray passengers pause to take in the alarms
space life preservers burst from their hover chairs
inflate around their necks
green lines appear on the floors
sleeping passengers are involuntarily led out of their cabins
every hover chair follows the illuminated lines
the procedure is completely automated
the passengers are all confused
helpless to stop it
the passengers glide in by the thousands
form concentric circles over the closed up pools
fill the multi storied balconies on all sides
they arrive together at the lido deck
mary notices a group of toddlers scared and crying
a nanny bot tries vainly to placate them
the bnl logo on the floor rotates
a large cylindrical device rises from the stage
the ships holo detector
jumbotrons activate on the dome
show the bridge
everyone can see the captain wrestling auto
he tries to speak to them during the fight strained in command ladies and gentlemen
this is your captain speaking
were having a slight malfunction with the autopilot
please remain calm
the passengers get caught up in the conflict
treat it as if it were a televised fight
eve and wall e fly out of the transport tunnel
make a beeline for the holo detector
ready and waiting for the plant
auto furiously spins his wheel
throws the captain to the floor
the entire ship lists dangerously to one side
eve and wall e slam into the holo detectors side
wall e drops the plant
it tumbles off the bridge plaza
eve is forced to set wall e down
he clings to the holo detector
she flies off to retrieve the plant
the hover chairs stay locked on their lines
passengers all slip off their chairs
their uniform color defaults back to red
slowly slide across the deck
and for the first time
all of humanity reaches out to one another
close ups of hands holding hands
everyone piles up on the listing side
the plant is buried underneath the mass of humanity
eve searches desperately amongst them
they hang together off their chairs
crying toddlers just above them
the kiddies slip out of their hover rings
mary gasps in horror
yells to john john get ready to have some kids
they purposefully let go of their chairs
grab hands forming a human chain
catch the toddlers
all slide together down the lido deck
the toddlers giggle the whole way down
they land at the bottom next to eve
an empty monorail car tips off the upper deck
lands on the pool level
it begins sliding down the lido deck
smashes vacant hover chairs in its wake
gasp eve looks up
sees the monorail sliding towards them
she stops the car before it hits
struggles to hold it up
cant let it crush the passengers below her
auto keeps the ship tilted
glides over to the holo detector button
switches it off
the holo detector begins to lower back into the floor
wall e is still hanging onto it
he uses all his strength
and wedges himself under the upper lip of the detector
stops it from disappearing into the floor
the pressure squeezes wall e into a box
the holo detector button buzzes and flashes
auto calls up a lido deck security camera view
discovers wall e wedged in the device
auto presses down on the off button
the holo detectors hydraulics fight against him
wall e desperately fights to hold it up
begins slowly to expand himself
and push the holo detector back up
the captain watches wall es heroic rise on screen
auto flips out his taser
jams it into the off button
short circuits it
the holo detector reverses full force
crushes wall e
we cant tell if he survived the crush
eve calls out for him
trapped holding up the monorail car above the passengers
the captain watches wall e being crushed
he braces his arms against the floor
and rises up on his own two feet
the passengers collectively gasp
their captain is standing
and walking himself up the railing
auto hears the distant cheering
wonders whats up
auto whips around
shocked to see the captain standing albeit wobbly
finds himself face to face with him
auto flips out his taser
rushes at him
the captain grabs it
the taser arcs in the captains face
sees a control panel high up on autos column
the captain looks auto in the eye
raises a finger up to the control panel
to the autopilot button
and flicks the switch to manual
grits his teeth auto you are relieved of duty
noo auto is instantly turned off
the captain smiles triumphantly
grabs the wheel with both hands
makes the ship level again
the passengers all spill across the deck
shaken but ok
eve sets the monorail down
rockets over to the holo detector
wall e is pinned under the lip of the holo detector
eve tries to lift it up
it wont budge
she looks back to the crowd
he searches the crowd for the plant
humans begin to stand for the first time all around him
through his pov he spots the plant mixed in among them
foreign contaminant flashes on his display screen
she fights to keep the machine from crushing wall e further
m o holds the plant up from across the lido deck
the vacu bot shoots it into the hands of a passenger
humans and robots form an impromptu fire line
toss it up to eve on stage
she shoves the plant into the device
the detector instantly scans the plant
plant origin verified
course set for earth
slowly the holo detector rises
wall e topples out from underneath
badly crushed and leaking oil
eve gasps in horror
m o and the rejects avert their eyes
passengers recoil as well
it converts into a giant star chart
rapidly plots a course for earth
ten seconds to hyperjump
eve lifts wall e up
no sign of life
m os head drops in despair
the passengers witness grief for the first time
begin to have new feelings of their own sadness sympathy
mary begins to cry
buries her head in johns shoulder
nine eight seven six five four three two one zero
the ceiling countdown hits
the ship jumps to light speed
the passengers and robots are thrown off their feet
everyone holds on to one another
the captain struggles to keep control of the steering wheel
fights the g forces
humans and robots hang on for dear life
john and mary cling to each other and the babies
she holds tightly to wall e
still calling out his name
the axiom zooms through hyperspace
the cockroach waits obediently on the hill
exactly where wall e told him to stay
his antennae twitch with boredom
appears on the ground
the cockroach watches the dot run down the hillside
the ground begins to shake
the insect looks to the sky
a dark patch grows behind the clouds
blots out the sunlight
the axioms keel breaks through
its shadow swallows up the entire landscape
the cockroach senses his masters return
hundreds of red dots rush past him
he eagerly chases after them
the city size starliner lowers gracefully from the sky
pushes back the clouds to the horizon
the circle of dots triangulate over the abandoned berth
converge over the ports landing shaft
thousands of feet deep
the ships keel descends into it
the earth shudders
trash towers tumble in the distance
then all is quiet
a row of giant doors open on the side of the ship
multiple gangways automatically extend
connect with built in terminals on the port
the captain walks out gingerly
holding the boot w plant
the other passengers step out on their own legs
wobble like toddlers
they squint up at the harsh sunlight
a commotion is heard from the back
somebody trying to push through
appears out of the crowd
cradles a boxed up wall e in her arms
m o and the rejects follow behind her
they rush across the gangway
the cockroach meets up with eve
climbs up onto wall e
doesnt understand why his master isnt responding
eve urgently scans the landscape
locks on to wall es truck in the distance
she takes to the air
m o and the rejects chase after her down the gangway
the captain respectfully removes his hat
good luck friend
the interior is dark and still
suddenly the junk jingles and clinks as the back door opens
eve flies inside with wall e
sets him on the floor
she scans the rotating shelves at high speed
grabs a car jack
ratchets up wall es crushed body
spare parts being grabbed by eve
frantically installs the new parts into wall e
her arms a blur of precision in motion
replaces his damaged circuit board
the final piece
she opens his new solar panels
and blasts a hole in the ceiling with her gun
the rejects stop
see the roof of wall es truck explode
a shaft of sunlight beams down on wall e
eve holds her breath watches
apple reboot sfx wall es meter fully charges
his head slowly rises from his box
the cockroach hops with joy
eve is relieved
she holds out her hand to him
with love wall e
wall e gives her a blank stare
he turns away from eve
motors out the truck
she grabs him
turns him back around
wall e just stares
doesnt seem to know who she is
hums here look at these
she grabs the rubiks cube and light bulb from the shelf
the light bulb glows in her hand
she gives them to wall e
wall e looks blankly at the junk on the shelves
hums i know
she hovers over to the video player
plays hello dolly
looks back to see if it has any effect
wall e is over at the shelves
has scooped all his prized possessions into his compactor
crushes them into a cube
eve is gut punched
wall e motors outside
runs over the cockroach on his way out
the insect pops back to life
watches his friend in shock
wall e rolls up to a nearby trash pile
scoops up trash
spits out a cube
eve hovers over to him
still in disbelief
wall e continues to stack his cubes
she stops him
lifts his head
stares into his eyes
eve presses his play button
nothing but static
eve begins to panic
she hovers in silence next to him for a long time
finally eve grasps wall es hand
forces his fingers to interlace with hers
holds him close one last time
leans her head against his
hums iotam she touches her forehead to his
goodbye wall e
a tiny spark between them
eve turns to hover away
her fingers caught between his
she checks his eyes again
a tiny servo noise
she looks down at their hands
they start to move
slowly close around eves
she looks back at his face
wall es eyes gradually come into focus
his brows raise
he notices their hands entwined
his dream come true
amazed ee vah
the hello dolly tape reaches the finale of iotam
and that is all that loves about
eve and wall e stare into each others eyes
m o and the rejects finally reach the truck
they begin to celebrate
wall es alive
then m o realizes they need privacy
herds the rejects o
go go go
wall e and eves foreheads touch
together now and ever more
and well recall when time runs out
newly planted in the earth
small hands water it gently
pull out to reveal it surrounded by kids
the captain instructs them
john and mary help unload equipment from the axiom
robots and passengers stream off the ship
this is called farming
you kids are going to grow all kinds of plants vegetable plants pizza plants
laughs ahh its good to be home
the camera pulls out from the axiom
over the bay
that it only took a moment
past wall e eve holding hands in his truck
over m o and the rejects cleaning outside
through the trash towers of the city
past a field of plants sprouting from its peak
up through the cloud cover
out into space
to be loved a whole life long
and settles on
