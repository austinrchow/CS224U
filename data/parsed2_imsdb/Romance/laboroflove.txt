night shyamalan a three lane highway relegated to one lane
the serpentine line of cars bottlenecks as it slithers by
an arch of orange and red flares outlines the area of shattered glass and twisted metal
we are at the site of a gruesome car accident
an ambulance and four police cars are on the scene
two cars are involved in the crash
the first a silver cadillac with its front caved in a perfect semi circle there is no one inside the car
the second car is a different story entirely
a dark green honda prelude crushed against the concrete median that separates the south bound lanes from the north bound lanes
all the windows have imploded
the original seventeen foot length of the car compressed to ten
the hood has folded back into the front seat
this car is not empty
through the sliver that used to be a window we see a female hand purple swollen and bloody
some drivers have stopped their cars on the shoulder and have walked over to the flares
a set of cops wave them back
get back in your cars and continue with the traffic
there is nothing you can do
beat get back in your cars
officer pierce speaks to a female officer dana
whats the story
shes been dead about ten minutes
the jaws are on the way
ran a license check
her name is ellen parker
forty two years old
what about him
pierce gestures to a hispanic teenager who is cuffed behind his back and being led to a police car
how old is he
its his grandfathers car
on his way back from drinking with the boys
pierce lets it sink in
who do we contact for her
dana checks the papers in her hand
they live in wynnewood
married seventeen years
pierce looks back at what remains of the honda prelude
there isnt any good left in the world dana
not one damn thing
close up of the hypnotic red and blue lights that consume the highway
just after dawn
a gentle mist hangs in the air
the calm suburban streets wait to be flooded with a sea of middle class homeowners on their way to work
a womans reebok cross trainers move along the sidewalk
long brisk steps steps people have when walking with a purpose
the cross trainers enter the doors of a bakery store seconds after a man turns a window sign from closed to open
this happens with precision timing not losing a step
a well practiced routine
angelo a large man black slicked hair has laid out three identical loaves of raisin bread on the counter
very good batch today
we finally see the person standing in the reebok cross trainers
ellen parker a woman in her forties with a heart warming smile and wise glint in her eyes
the kind of woman that somehow becomes more beautiful with age
she carefully squeezes each loaf
her hand hovers over the middle loaf
twenty minutes later
the basket of the chosen raisin bread is placed on the center of a table
ellen covers it with a cloth napkin
the eggs sizzle in a pan
we find ellen cooking breakfast
a stunning african grey parrot sits proudly on ellens shoulder
claude is a breathtaking creature with grey feathers and a cherry red tail
the door bell rings
where a delivery man hands over a bouquet of violet orchids
claude still perched on ellen like a clothing accessory spreads his impressive wings defensively
the delivery man scans the far wall to find a collection of bird photographs
a dazzling collection of all kinds of birds elaborately framed and hung
ellen signs the release and closes the door
she takes a deep smell of the violet orchids and looks down the hall to the open bedroom door with a glowing smile
we catch a glimpse of a man dressing
where ellen and her husband are eating breakfast
claude is now in a cage in the hallway
maurice parker eats a buttered piece of raisin bread
he is a man in his late forties neatly combed hair his new york times folded into a manageable rectangle
this is a man who has been seated a great deal of his life
the type of man who breaks into a sweat when taking out the garbage
he feels a stare and looks up to find his wife with that glowing smile
he smiles back
ellen gestures with her eyes to the violet orchids now displayed proudly on the window ledge
maurice studies them
who sent them
this takes ellen by surprise
maurice catches the expression
you thought i sent them
disappointed there was no card
maurice reaches over and searches the bouquet
have i forgotten something
is this a special day
flat its just a regular day
maurice pulls out a small bent card from between the stems
its from dan and kate wilkins
for dinner last week
maurice hands ellen the card she looks at it uninterested
its a special day isnt it
well im sure its not christmas because youd be worried about how much money we dont have to spend on each other
i know its not new years because youd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you dont like to dance
and im sure its not our anniversary because i didnt find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says pick out something pretty
yes maurice im virtually certain its not a special day today
ellen begins to eat
maurice stares at her
youre mad at me
you were beaming a minute ago but since i didnt send the flowers
now youre mad at me
why would i send flowers
whats the occasion
ellen instantly becomes emotional
because you love me
thats the occasion
ellen returns to eating
maurice stares at her quietly
a shaft of light penetrates the darkness of a room
growing larger as the door swings open
ellen steps in first followed by maurice
ellen goes straight for the blinds
burst of light stab the room
the spines of the books catch the light
rows and rows of books cradled by a maze of mahogany book shelves
this is an old fashioned store with antique chairs at select places
a coffee table sits near the window with a set of deep cushioned sofa chairs
this store is a home
maurice moves behind the counter and turns on the radio
chopin flows from the old speakers atop the corner shelves delicately
ellen opens the door to the store and locks it in that position with a slanted piece of wood
the store is now open
half a dozen people wander the isles
maurices eyes drift to a pair of eleven year olds who have sauntered into the store
one boy disappears behind philosophy and reappears momentarily with his sweat shirt zipped up to his neck a rectangle is outlined under his shirt
i see that
maurice comes around the corner the boys haul ass out of the store
theyre long gone before maurice reaches the door
he yells after them
im getting a doberman
ellen who is sitting in the back room doing the accounts comes out when she hears the commotion
youve been saying that for two years i think they know youre bluffing
maurice inspects the philosophy section
maurice looks up as a young man early twenties hurries in
kris reddy walks past maurice his black locks of hair peeking out from under his philadelphia eagles cap
to maurice lizy bennett
kris waves as he removes his jacket
he is wearing a parker books t shirt underneath
he pins an assistant manager tag on
maurice thinks to himself
the answer comes to him pride and prejudice
it has to be a full characters name
they called her lizy in the book
beat sorry i was late
my jeep died on the way over from the paper
they printed your article on dry verses can dog food
pulitzer here i come
kris notices as maurice goes back to searching the isles
never have children
if theyre not a burden to you theyre a burden to someone else
on the end of his words kris go to the pharmacy
donnavan to get you a large bottle of geritol
tell him maurice has officially become a grumpy old man
whatd they take this time
as if theyre going to read nietzsche
maurice moves back behind the counter clearly irritated
they pick on you because they can get a rise out of you
children can sense those things
kris quickly opens his black shoulder bag and pulls out a mini tape recorder
he talks into it dead serious
juvenile delinquency are the victims to blame
the tape recorder returns to the bag
ellen stares at him curiously
ill forget them otherwise
ellen nods with realization
ellen and kris turn their attention to maurice who is mumbling to himself angrily
he looks out the window to the street to see a familiar group of school boys waving at him tauntingly
red and gold paper mache lanterns are sprinkled around the room
we find ellen and maurice polishing off a dish of general tsos chicken
two thousand square feet
we can add a used book section
ellen is not listening
she is staring at a young couple two tables over who cant take their eyes off each other
next door is a jewelry store with a full time security guard
he stands outside all day
lets see them try and take nietzsche then
maurice finally notices ellen is not listening
snapping out of it what
the new store
honey i told you
if it makes you happy we should just do it
its a tremendous amount of work moving
we can do it together
maurice needed the support
his face brightens
an empty table
the dishes have been cleared
maurice and ellen are opening their fortune cookies
whats yours say
love is shown through actions not just words
thats not a fortune
you will be rich
thats a fortune
what you have is a statement
what it is is the truth
i dont follow
maurice what would you do for me
what would you do for our love
im not talking about saying im talking about doing
maurice notices the strain in her voice
is this going to be similar to the flower incident
very emotional sometimes people need to see things done for them because sooner or later they dont believe the words anymore
raising his voice you dont think i love you
lowering the volume i want to be shown
beat maurice would you do anything for me
what do you want from me
would i swim across an ocean for you
would i walk across the united states for you
yes i would
you know that
soft no i dont
i dont even know if youd walk across the street for me
maurice is getting redder by the second
the entire restaurant hangs on his response
so what have you done for me thats so earth shattering
the waiter closest to the table cringes with maurices words
ellen drains of color
she stares at him in complete and utter disbelief
she drills him with this iron glare for an eternity then grabs her purse and heads to the exit
maurice stares at the table for a moment to gather whats left of his dignity and follows her out
the waiter moves to the table and clears the aftermath
he sees ellens fortune crumpled next to her tea cup
he unravels it
the fortune reads
the room is lit by one bedside lamp
maurice is sitting in bed wearing a robe
reading glasses at the end of his nose as he rubs a yellow cloth over a silver medallion
the medallion has a raised picture of a lamp the kind aladdin uses seated on an open book and the words book society
maurice meticulously rubs away the smudge marks
ellen is at the edge of the bed as far from maurice as possible
her back is to him as she sleeps under the covers
she speaks without turning around
why do you polish that thing all the time
youre talking to me
why do you polish it
maurice studies the impressive silver medallion
a book society award is a very prestigious thing
why are you polishing it in bed in your pajamas at at night
are you going to show it to someone
theres no reason
it just makes you feel good to do something for it to express your pride and affection for it some how
beat how come youd do that for a piece of metal and not for me
maurice has no answer
he just stares at his hands
ellens face can be seen under the covers facing away from maurice
her eyes are red
the tears roll off her nose and land on the pillow unseen and unheard
the kitchen table is mockingly empty
not even a crumb
maurice dressed for work eyes the table with great resolve
he rubs his hands together ceremoniously
i can do this
maurice moves to the fridge and gets out two eggs onions green peppers and mushrooms
claude is chirping incessantly from the hall
the pile teeters precariously in maurices arms as he moves to the counter
next the pans come out he tries to pull the bottom pan from the cabinet ellen is seated in bed arms crossed equal resolve in her face
a large metallic crash of pots echoes from downstairs
ellen grabs her robe
ellen gently takes claude out of his cage
she kisses him
the bird once frantic instantly at peace
whispering you missed mommie
worried when i didnt come down
ellen feeds the bird as she peeks around the corner careful not to be seen
maurice is desperately trying to cook an out of control omelette
it spills over the sides and sizzles on the range top
he tries to scoop it up with the pan tilting it further further the entire omelette slides onto the range
maurice frantically tries to wrangle it back in
ellen has to keep herself from laughing
her expression changes to pity as she watches the chaos unfold
ellen scrutinizes a new three loaves of raisin bread
angelo smiles and packages the chosen loaf
a defeated maurice is eating an apple
he looks up with surprise as ellen walks into the kitchen from the back door a bag under her arm
she glances at him and then moves to the counter where she prepares the bread for serving
ellen looks down into the trash to find the rebellious omelette sitting uneaten
the bread gets laid out in its usual basket in its usual manner
maurice says nothing as ellen pulls two eggs from the fridge and cracks them on a sizzling pan with expert ease
maurice smiles warmly at his wifes back before moving to her and hugging her from behind
he whispers in her ear
why do you put up with me
has something to do with it
maurice reaches over and turns off the stove
he then turn ellen around and kisses her long and hard
ellen pulls away gently and stares into his eyes
maurice looks very emotional
i do love you
very very much
with all his heart i will i promise
ellen kisses maurice and returns to the eggs
maurice continues to hug her from behind
the morning sun pours into the kitchen covering ellen and maurice in a golden bath
a large black man wearing a dress shirt sleeves rolled up to the elbows turns on a switch
a set of tube lights flicker carl stone leads maurice out to the main room which is presently a cob web infested barren space with a few discarded packing boxes
left in the corners
maurice runs his fingertips against the wall
history and the arts will be here
his hand makes a grand swirl pointing to another area
he says the next two words with great awe as if he was saying something holy
carl watches curiously as maurice walks around in a trance
he moves to the bay window that over looks the street
well have a hand painted sign
another grand swirl parker books
maurices already bright eyes brighten even more as he spots the security guard strolling up and down the front of the jewelry store
the guard catches his stare and waves
maurice is aglow
he turns to carl
this is my dream
its finally here
carl has to smile rarely does he see someone so happy
we are in carls cramped upstairs office
just enough room to walk amongst the file cabinets
maurice holds his pen over the documents before him
i wish my wife were here
she should see this
stalling she had a doctors appointment in blue bell
thats a one and a half hour drive
ellens been going to that doctor since she moved to pennsylvania
understanding we could do this tomorrow
ellen gave me strict orders to sign it
we invited some friends over you see for a celebration
carl smiles patiently hes seen this before
maurice gathers his strength as he puts pen to paper
he scribbles his signature quickly and lets the pen drop to the table top as if all the energy drained from his body
he looks up to carl with powerful eyes
every journey begins with one step right
enjoy your party mr
your new store will be waiting for you monday morning
carl and maurice shake hands like best friends
a wine chiller sits proudly on the coffee table
the sounds of light conversation float through the room
about ten friends and family have gathered
maurice sits on the sofa nearest the window
hes listening to the drone of ted price
ellen is not present
so she says the l word after two dates the l word
she says dont you believe in true love
love that can conquer all
i say whoa hold on
just so were clear on things i think love these days is shit
it dont mean a thing and it dont stand for nothing
you know what she says fine but how do you feel about kids
everyone near the sofa laughs
a car light dances on the curtains
maurice quickly pulls the curtain aside and watches as the car pulls past the house and around the corner
maurice turns back from the window hiding his concern and without missing a beat
its nice to see you dont have any scars from your divorce
this brings on another round of laughter
maurice rises from his seat but is waved off by adelle matlin who picks up the phone right away
adelle is maurices niece early thirties very attractive and always smiling except at this moment
ted begins another one of his stories the words are incoherent as maurice watches adelle carefully
adelle turns her back to the room as she talks and then disappears into the kitchen stretching the phone cord around the doorway
something is definitely wrong
maurice steadies his gaze at the door of the kitchen
eternal seconds pass before adelle appears again
she looks different ghostly
she glances up for a fraction of a second locking eyes with her uncle she immediately looks away
maurice watches adelle move to her husband gerald and whispers in his ear
gerald changes instantly taking on the same ghostly transformation his eyes dart to maurice
teds story is cut off as maurice speaks loudly
the room goes silent as all eyes fall on adelle and gerald
shaking maurice can we go into the dining room
whats happened to my wife
this hits everyone in the room like a bomb
a dread hangs over every passing second
gerald crumbles under the moment
adelle begins to cry
there was a car accident
some of the crowd reacts
a women covers her mouth
the moment is unbearable
to himself please god dont do this
gerald cracks the tears start to flow from his eyes
maurice it was serious
i dont know how to gerald buries his face into the heels of his palms as if trying to contain an explosion in his head
oh jesus please help me
ellen didnt make it
ellens dead maurice
maurice closes his eyes shut tightly
like a child scared of the dark
adelle blacks out knocking over the wine chiller on the way to the ground
in less than a minute the room has transformed from a celebration to a mourning
everyone is frozen staring at maurice for their cue
a child in her mothers arms begins to cry as if aware of the circumstances
extreme close up
maurice opens his eyes slowly
the room stays still as maurice stares at ellens hat sitting on the piano
a ftd florist truck pulls up
a delivery man moves with an extravagant bouquet of flowers to the front door
he rings the door bell
the delivery man looks to the ground and searches before placing the bouquet on the porch
we now see that the porch is completely covered with flowers bouquets and wreaths
the delivery man tip toes his way through the maze of condolences and moves to his truck
maurice waits as the sound of the flower truck fades away then looks into claudes cage
claude sits on the highest perch and continues to call to his mother
maurice stares at the pile of untouched food on the floor of the cage
eat the food claude
maurice seated at the kitchen table
he looks at the bouquet of flowers still seated on the window sill
the violet orchids are all dead and shriveled up
the house feels abandoned lifeless
from the hall
his hopeless cries punctuating the air every few seconds
maurice sits in a chair facing ellens wardrobe closet
the lights in the room are off
the room is lit only by the maurice gets up and with a great deal of uncertainty opens the closet
maurice stares at the collection of hanging dresses
he reaches out and pulls the cloth of a floral dress towards him
he closes his eyes and smells the cloth
his face tightens in pain
both hands cling to the dress tightly
he tries desperately cant fight it maurice parker begins to cry
his hands grab frantically at the rest of the dresses pressing them to his face and chest
im sorry ellen
im so sorry
he hugs the dresses as if they were her
his weeping turns to a torturous wail of grief
all the love all the anger spilling out in this one moment
he falls to the ground yanking all the dresses down with him they collapse atop him
he buries his face in his wifes clothes
the muffled sound of his cries echoes through the lonely house
the neighborhood park
the trees in full bloom
maurice walks down a path leading to the open fields
only mothers with strollers and the elderly are out this early
maurice is seated on a park bench
across from him is an elderly couple in their seventies
the old woman is frail with tiny eyes that disappear when she smiles
the husband is a skinny man with a baseball hat that makes him look like a little boy
maurice watches them silently as they sit and hold hands
their warm laughs and whispered conversations stinging him
he watches as the old man gets up
the old woman tries to make him stay but he playfully pulls away
she shakes her head like a shy school girl as the old man walks back down the path by himself
the old woman glances maurices way
the old woman glances at the empty baby carriage standing next to the bench
is it a boy or a girl
oh thats not mine
maurice gestures to the woman and baby who are sitting on a blanket in the grass
i dont have kids
children are a blessing from god
i have four
the old woman studies him
are you okay
is that your husband
she nods yes
you look so happy how long have you been married
forty seven years
this hits maurice hard
are you married
this hits maurice even harder
this is painful yes
the old woman looks down the path for her husband
where did he go
hes getting my sweater from the car
i said there was a breeze
shaking her head i told him not to go
may i ask you a question that might sound strange
how do you know he loves you
the old woman looks at him oddly
i mean besides
time how did you know ten years ago twenty years ago
she thinks hard
no answer for a moment then the old woman sees something out of the corner of her eye her husband is walking up the path with her white lace sweater
over his arm
she smiles as the answer comes to her
because he shows me
hes not much for words but he shows me
maurice sits back her answer lingers in the air like a haunting voice
maurice watches as the old man comes back and drapes his wife with the sweater
the old woman waves as they continue down the path
hand in hand
an obese woman with a hacking cough sits to the left of maurice
to the right a man with a patch over his eye
the nurse sticks her head outside the glass divider till maurice stands up
royce checks a chart
maurice watches him from his perch on the examination chair
so whats the deal maurice
i mean why the sudden voluntary visit usually it takes gun point to get you in here
routine i assure you
i just wanted to gage my health
am i healthy
yes you are
im going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar
royce folds his arms and waits
whats this all about
how far could an individual walk if they had no athletic training you understand just an ordinary person
royce stares at him suspiciously
i know what youre getting at
ive seen it before
youre feeling old and you want to start exercising
a lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth
dont feel embarrassed about it
playing along okay
you should start slow and easy fifteen minutes a day
how far in one attempt whats the farthest someone like myself could walk
the doctor is confused again
just for curiosity sake thats all
i dont know maybe twenty miles
of course im not recommending that
if someone like you had to i mean
thats how far theyd probably get before encountering serious physical walls
maurice thinks about it carefully as the doctor returns to the chart
a hip young woman with her forehead wrapped in a headband chews away on a stick of gum
joselle leans over the counter with maurice and studies a map
each inch represents miles
making the grand total
damn baby relax
im getting to it
taking on a rehearsed tone from philadelphia following the route highlighted to pacifica california youre traveling an estimated three thousand two hundred miles
maurice is a bit pale
he follows the yellow highlighted highways winding its way across the u
three thousand miles
how many times does twenty go into three thousand
what was that
perhaps theres another route
this is the route approved by triple a
even if you followed back roads the entire way youd still be looking at roughly the same distance
joselle studies his concerned expression
dont worry baby it shouldnt take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat
by car right
joselle scrunches her face in exaggerated shock and takes a step back to look maurice up and down
how else you gonna get there on the ground
maurice gives her a sad expression
if she only knew
the future parker books
the room sits as empty and barren as before
maurice sits on the floor against the far wall
he stares at his new store
his gaze turns to the window where the guard strolls by
the guard doesnt notice him
maurice looks terrible his eyes red and framed by bags
his skin a yellowish white
he moves to his feet and turns off the lights
kris unloads the last of a shipment of books
he moves to maurice who sits by the window to the street
maurice points to a chair across from him and kris takes a seat
why do you want to be a journalist kris
what sparked your interest
i want to reach people
nobody listens to me
this is my way to reach them
to reach people you have to feel something first
you write about the wrong things
how can you feel for dog food
the people at the gazette dont respect it and neither do you
this is a ghost town
nothing ever happens
write from your heart
thats why the classics are great
why are you telling me this mr
maurice looks out the window and picks up an envelope from the coffee table between them
he hands it to kris
your bus is arriving
kris opens the envelope and finds money
its one months pay
kris gets up
a shock of adrenaline hits him
are you firing me
i wont be here for a while
the store will be closed in the interim
kris grabs his coat shifting his attention between the window and maurice
you going on a trip mr
kris moves to the door
what day are you arriving
im not sure sometime in january i think
kris stops cold
the door to the street half open
when are you leaving
kris is seriously confused now
maurice decides to end the confusion
im walking there kris
kris jaw hits the floor as the bus pulls to a stop across the street
kris pulls up his sleeve and glances at his forearm
the hairs on my arm are standing up
something strange is happening
i always knew you had good instincts
beat goodbye kris
ill see you when i get back
kris hesitates before darting out of the store across the street and into the bus
kris takes a seat in the back and digs into his bag and pulls out the tape recorder
the death of a spouse can it drive you insane
the suburbs come to life
men and women leaving for work
school buses picking up their cargo of passengers
store owners opening their businesses
a group of eleven year old boys including the two kleptomaniacs we saw earlier are standing before a closed door staring at a sign
they look at each other before heading down the block
the sign reads closed owner out of town
the house is eerily silent
three things lay on the dining table
a shoulder bag filled with clothes
a carrying bag with personals
and a set of maps
maurice checks the locks on all windows
he places all the food in the refrigerator into a trash bag
he pulls out a drawer and loosens a side panel a wad of money flops out
maurice pockets the bills
maurice walks through the hall with a portable cage
he stops before claudes hanging cage
no movement no chirping
maurice stares emotionally for a moment before reaching in and carefully removing claudes lifeless body from the bottom of the cage
maurice looks down at the lost pet in his hands
i know how you feel
maurice buries the bird in the backyard
maurice sits at the table
the essentials laying before him
he clings to a wallet size photo of ellen
maurice stands and gathers his things
maurice stands at the edge of the water
recreations of historical ships are docked in the harbor
the old fashioned sails and masts sway in the gentle breeze
the sounds of a street vendor catch maurices ears
he turns to see a funnel cake booth in a row of food stalls
the harbor is jammed with people
a street fair is in full swing
the sounds of a live band mix with the cries of the maurice early twenties
skinny dark rich hair
he yells out from behind a booth of paperback books
three dollars a piece
two for four dollars
all the classics
a young woman emerges from the crowd of browsers
maurice begins to speak but is caught off guard by young ellens beautiful features
maurice manages a few words
can i help you
my father owns the food stall over there
maurice looks over to find an enormous man serving food
you look thirsty
ellen places the soda she had at her side on the table
maurice is completely flustered
hi im ellen
ellen places her hand out
maurice grabs it instinctively and shakes
ellen looks at the full table of books
not doing too good huh
maurice nods no
itll pick up
ive been coming to these things my whole life
people dont want to carry things as they walk around
youll sell as the fair starts to end
ellen waits for maurice to say something but nothing comes out
you dont talk much do you
i read a lot
ellens father bellows for her over the crowd
maurice jumps at the sound
i better go
ellen starts for her booth come over if you get hungry
ellen disappears into a sea of people
maurice stands in awe for a second before snapping out
he shakes his head to himself
i read a lot
the people are filing out of the street
maurice is a whirl wind of activity as people wave dollar bills at him calling out classical titles
maurice glances over to ellens booth
she is watching him with a big smile
maurice gestures to the line with a shocked expression
the booths are packing up
ellen helps pack away the remaining food
a book is placed in front of her on the counter
the book is romeo and juliet
ellen looks up to see a very shy maurice standing before her
ellen gives him a smile that melts him
are you trying to tell me something
maurice eyes ellens dad who throws him deadly glances
maurice is very intimidated
he whispers to her
barely audible walk with me
you like to take walks
but i want to take a walk with you
ellen looks at him carefully
looks right through him
you just said something very sweet
the water reflects the lights from the harbor
maurice and ellen are standing very close
what are you thinking
ellen looks out onto the water
its one of those thoughts you keep to yourself
please tell me
i was just thinking that if we actually became a couple this was a beautiful place to begin things
maurice is bright red
ellen giggles at his shyness
maurice gathers his strength and looks her straight in the eyes
maurice leans forward and kisses her softly
maurice tears in his eyes stands in the spot they stood many years before
softly i love you ellen
on this empty dock
on this hot day in september
with no witnesses and no fan fare maurice parker takes the first steps of his journey
a topless cherry red wrangler jeep pulls out of a mechanics garage and moves down route
kris reddy is at the wheel
a daily gazette sign flaps from his roll bar
kris changes the station on the radio as his eye catches a man walking on the opposite side of the street
kris turns back to the road mind racing
brakes screech as the jeep slows and then rumbles over the island separating the lanes
making a u turn across a four lane highway
maurice wiping his brow with a handkerchief
the wrangler jeep rolls up next to him as he walks
maurice doesnt stop walking as kris leans over the passenger seat
looking ahead round the world in eighty days
what are you doing mr
i told you
cars honk as they pull by the slow duo
youre walking to california
pacifica california its a coastal city
oh a coastal city
kris looks around to see if anyone else sees the lunacy in this moment
ellen told me that she didnt know if i loved her
she knew you loved her
she wasnt certain
i never really showed her
im really lost
what does this have to do with walking
i said i would do anything for her
and she didnt believe me
i said id walk across the country for her
she didnt believe me
maurice looks to kris rolling along beside him
he sees the worried expression on his face
i need to show her how much i love her kris
because i should have shown her before
everyday i should have shown her
thats a long ways away
so ive been informed
kris tries to act calm but it doesnt last long
you cant walk across the united states its over three thousand miles
maurice takes his time with the response
kris waves more cars to pass them
ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast
now thats about a quarter mile each way
that comes to about three thousand miles
he smiles to himself and you know what kris
she never ate a slice
maurice picks up speed surer with every step
kris slows the jeep to a stop and reaches into his bag
the mini tape recorder goes on with a click
the question we never ask what would we do for love
kris watches through the windshield as mr
parker disappears down route
the wreaths flowers and bouquet have now tripled in number
they spill onto the lawn and walkway
a neighborhood dog rummages through the more colorful bouquets
the abandoned house
a telephone rings continuously
it stops after a string of rings
it begins again after a few the dark bookcases echo the rings of the telephone
the answering machine finally picks up
hello youve reached parker books our store hours are eight to six
a center city town house
wall to wall books cognitive psychology physiology of behavior abnormal psychology clinical psychology the titles cover every shelf and every tabletop
adelle matlin hangs up the phone and moves to the living room where her husband is reading a paper in his recliner
gerald looks on with an assuring smile
he probably just went somewhere
for a walk
i dont know
are you kidding
he hates walking
the empty street echoes with the tired shuffle of maurice stops in this tracks and picks up a crushed coke can from the side of the road
he places it upright at the place where he stands
maurice immediately walks off the highway into a small motel parking lot
a motel clerk checks his wooden keys
pool times are am to pm theres cable in every room with two premium channels
hbo and cinemax
pay per view channels can be i need a bed and i need tylenol
the room comes with two twin sealy posturepedics
but the tylenol will be extra
maurice stares at him with exhausted eyes
maurices shoulder bags are on the bed
the water is maurice gently moves his hands under the bathtub head checking the temperature
he sits on the edge of the tub
maurice peels off his shoes with great pain
they slide across the dull white tiles into the corner
the once well kept english loafers could be mistaken for trash now
maurice rubs his barefeet with both hands grimacing from the pain
the tub is almost filled
maurice stops the tap
the steam from the water fills the room
maurice raises his legs with great effort and submerges each leg into the steaming water
his eyes close with great relief as his body melts into the tub
maurice lays his head on the side of the tub
it only takes ten seconds before maurices snoring fills the bathroom
the neon motel sign throbs red
superimposed across this image are the words maurice looks down the highway
eyes squinting to block out the sun
the road winds and dissolves into the horizon
maurice looks back the way he came a second of indecision
the moment passes
maurice takes a deep breath before moving to the crushed coke can
he moves to the exact spot where he left the road the night before and begins walking again
the elevator bell dings letting off a cargo of newspaper personnel
frank and seth are two of them
they make their way to the desks
a sea of desks pressed against each other each desk has a computer
frank and seth come to their corner and stop before a young man phillies cap turned backwards sitting behind an ibm dx
fingers flying over the keyboard
someones got a hot story
what time did you get in
kris reddy keeps typing
he spits out the answer after a few seconds
whats this one about kris
blinds or curtains the eternal question
boxers verses tight undies the battle continues
frank and seth crack up laughing
frank reaches for the printouts
kris immediately covers them with his hand
he stares up with a smile
read about it on sunday
maurice exits an athletic store in a small town
on his feet a new pair of sneakers
maurice as he walks down a winding highway
his new sneakers shuffling slowly
a sharp pain shoots up maurices leg
his knees buckle
the shoulder bags tumble to the ground followed by maurice himself
from a distance it looks like hes been shot
maurice grabs the back of his thigh and tries to straighten his leg out
his face frozen in a painful expression
maurice rubs his legs slowly working the cramp out
he relaxes a bit as he finally straightens his leg
maurice sits there motionless eyes glazed
the sounds of a bird snap him out of his trance
he looks up to see a painted bunting a bird about six inches in height fly down from a tree and land on a rock next to him
maurice stares at the beautiful bird curiously
its body splashed with brilliant blues reds and greens
it looks out of place in these mundane surroundings
maurice looks around the skies to see no other birds
the painted bunting chirps a few times before taking flight into the air
it circles over maurice before disappearing behind the trees
he pulls himself to his feet with great effort
maurice opens all of his bags and begins emptying the essentials the maps food a canister of water
maurice reloads one bag and pulls it over his shoulder with great effort
at his feet are the rest of his belonging piled on the side of the road
maurice painfully begins walking again
we pull back on maurices figure walking on the highway
the pile of disregarded things laying by the side
the highway is endless
winding its way for miles and miles into a fixed dot in the distance
sunrise on pennsylvania
gerald picks the philadelphia gazette off the front porch
gerald flips open the paper as he waits before an empty plate
smells good honey
adelle puts the finishing touches on a stack of pancakes
she sets up two plates and brings them into the geralds eyes remain glued to the paper
adelle comes to the table holding the golden pancakes over the table
she notices the strange look on his face
what is it
maurice is in the paper
she stares silently at the paper laid out on the table
the headline beams at her adelle is shocked
she gazes at an old picture of her uncle printed underneath the headline
oh my god
she storms off into the kitchen with the golden pancakes
gerald looks down at his empty plate longingly
sergeant dally pretends to be concerned
what would you like us to do

or whatever its called
he isnt breaking any law
hes a grown man
he can crawl on his hands and knees to china if thats what he wants to do
sergeant im a psychologist and i know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems
my uncle lost his wife and it devastated him
were very sorry about that
some of our men were on the scene of the accident
i think my uncle is suffering from a condition called mania which is linked with depression
it is a time when an individual will act over confident and will act out impractical grandiose plans
sometimes these plans can be dangerous
how long does this
a couple days to a few months if untreated
dally digests this information
look ill see if anyone has spotted him recently
if i get any information ill call you
dont wait by the phone
if hes really been walking this whole time hes out of our jurisdiction
adelle looks very emotional
on the verge of tears
dont worry hell be back
hes in his forties
hes had no physical training
hell be back by the end of the week
a floating dot moves along a flat stretch of road
the sun drops behind rolling hills
the dot has become larger sprouting arms and legs
darkness has fallen
the dot has materializes into maurice
a clerk hands over a set of keys in exchange for money
maurice walks back onto the highway and steps next to an old boot that has been used as todays marker
maurice starts walking from that point
maurice grabs two handfuls of small green boxes
he places them on the table
the cashier stares down at the eight boxes of ben gay and rings it up
maurice standing at the entrance to a tunnel that pierces the side of a mountain side
maurice makes the sign of the cross and walks into the darkness
maurice appears on the other side with a smile of relief
hes awed at the beauty of the landscape
tiny clusters of buildings far in the distance wrapped in a blanket of green for miles on every side
maurice asleep in the bathtub
its raining hard like gun fire from the sky
maurice sits on the edge of a road rubbing his legs
his hair matted to his head
the rain pelts the ground in forceful waves
at a cash register maurice slaps ten more boxes of ben gay down on the counter
a teenage girl with braces looks at him like hes charles manson
his barefeet are propped up on his bag
his feet are swollen and red with fresh blisters
a pack of ice is wrapped around his knee with an old shirt
the picture of ellen clutched in his hand
two joggers pass maurice as he sees a flashing school sign
it is a suburban town
the fallen red and orange leaves cover every flat surface
a line of cars pulls around a semi circle driveway
maurice watches as parents drop off their children
a couple of ten year old boys walk by
maurice realizes theyre talking to him
sure man high top nike cross trainers with heel supports and air cushioned soles theyre nasty
the boys keep walking
maurice looks down at his sneakers with new found pride
after a while maurices attention switches back to the cars
one car in question catches maurices eye
a woman consoles a small child who doesnt want to leave the car
she wipes his tiny tears with her hand and hugs him tenderly
the little boys head cradled in her arms
the parker house many years ago
the house semi furnished
ellen carefully hangs her first bird photographs on the wall a striking aerial photo of a golden eagle
wings spread soaring high over a mountain range
i thought we both wanted the same things
ive changed my mind
you cant change your mind
ellen takes a seat on the only sofa
i want children
youve just decided is that right
young maurice is visibly upset
ellen there are two kinds of people in the world please not the two kinds of people speech
people that were made to be parents and people who were not made to be parents
my parents were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway
i dont want us to be that way ellen
you can change
face it ellen im not the type of person who reads bedtime stories
but you love me anyway
upset dont be so sure
ellen fiddles with her dress
she bites her bottom lip as she tries not to cry
shaky voice what if something happens to one of us
well be all alone
maurice loses his hard demeanor and moves next to her
he lays his hand across her shoulder
nothing will happen to us
its a bleak picture i know but were going to be together till were old and grey and you dont remember my name anymore
maurice lifts her chin with his hand gently
she blinks her eyes and a tear rolls down her cheek
he takes a deep breath
let me think about it okay
ellen brightens up immediately
im not saying anytime soon
im just saying that maybe we can consider it down the road sometime
ellen gives her patented glowing smile
she hugs him with all her strength
she whispers in his ear
i love you maurice parker
maurice walks away from the school shuffling through the piles of leaves that block the walkways
a child and her father walk down the path towards him
maurice looks away painfully
the childs soft laughter pounding in his ears as he quickens his pace
jackson liquor wholesalers
for the kind of people who buy whiskey by the crate
maurice has his map unfolded over the cash register
i can show you the main roads but thatll add ten miles to your trip
do you mind ten miles
the parking lot of the store looks like a used truck lot
every kind of supped up truck one could possibly imagine is on display here
maurice passes a canary yellow flatbed pick up with a group of men drinking a newly purchased case of beer
maurice gets about ten feet past them when he stops hesitates and then heads back to them
excuse me whos truck is this
the man sitting on the hood of the truck has dark hair and hasnt shaven in days
this unfortunate gentleman is named mine
are you and your friends planning on driving soon
denny gives maurice a greasy curious look
he squints his glazed eyes
yes we are
who the fuck are you
maurice doesnt look scared in fact he looks angered
you dont know me from adam but i want you to do something for me
i want you to wait until you sobered up before you get behind the wheel
i know this is out of the ordinary but one man to another would you do me that favor
then everyone in the group bursts out in drunken are you a preacher
seething with anger no i just dont want anybody dying because i didnt say something when i had the chance
dennys face goes blank
his steady gaze almost terrifying
ill drive my truck shit faced if i want to
you better turn around and walk away preacher
you dont know who youre talking to
maurice looks around at the hostile faces and decides on a retreat
denny watches maurice with predatory eyes
maurice practically hobbles his way down a road lined by towering pines
he stops to take a drink from his canister and keeps walking
the sounds of a car grow in the distance
maurice doesnt turn his back
the canary yellow truck pulls over the ridge with a load full of passengers
it gains distance on maurice
maurice hears the engine and waves his arm in the air signaling for it to pass him
maurice walks ten more feet before turning around
maurices face instantly changes when he sees the demented grins through the windshield of the truck
maurice turns and quickens his pace
the truck picks up pace
maurice breaks into a run
the truck speeds up passes maurice and stops in front of him
panic fills maurice as he watches the truck unload its drunken passengers
eyes scan the forest on either side for a way out
maurice decides to stand his ground
to himself this is indiana nothings going to happen to you
you need a ride preacher
the men walk up to maurice
no thank you ill walk
a tall lanky gentleman gestures to maurices shoulder bag with his beer can
some beer sprays maurices feet with the gesture
where you coming from
look gentlemen im late i need to ive been thinking who the hell is this preacher guy
coming up to me and my friends
looking like he wanted to kick my ass for drinking
denny gives maurice that inhuman stare
maurice is clearly frightened
then i figured it
you lost somebody because some asshole was drinking
maurice is frozen
maybe you lost a son
maurice looks up for a millisecond
denny doesnt miss it
stepping closer a wife
did someone piss drunk run into your wife
crushed her like a bug
snapped her bones
maurice is red with anger
denny loves it
oh the preachers getting angry again
denny goes ice cold tell me something
did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone
were you there to help her
or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face ill kill you
denny easily avoids it
maurice doesnt see the first blow coming it hits him in the chest maurice gasps for air as he buckles to the dirt
hands grab restrain
a powerful kick in the ribs another
another set of vicious kicks
the road and forest begin to spin
a painful slash across his face
maurice prepares for the next blow
it never comes
red and blue lights swirl
maurice looks up barely focusing a man leans over a car door
the image becomes clearer a policeman stands poised gun aimed directly at the men hovering over him
distorted and slowed step away from him now
officer merril grey balances a phone on his shoulder as he spreads a new coat of mayonnaise on his hoagie
need an i
check on a maurice a
grey reads maurices license
listening he was assaulted by a group of men just outside elkhart indiana
sergeant dally the officer adelle spoke to earlier listens on the other end of the phone his mouth agape
how is he
gesturing to a young officer at another desk to come over
dally cups the phone
call adelle matlin
tell her we found her uncle
the sea of desks are empty
one empty desk is lit kris reddys desk
the crackle of a shortwave c
unit floats through the large unoccupied room from an adjacent room
the we move to the back room to find kris writing furiously in front of an elaborate c
he jots down the words as fast as theyre said maurice parker
the transmission gets cut as the phone conversation ends
kris quickly rolls the chair across the room and grabs a map off the shelf
the map gets pinned under two coffee cups and a ceramic frog as kris traces the route from philadelphia to indiana
he sits up straight in astonishment as his eyes hit the key of the map
jesus hes walked six hundred miles
kris glances at the hairs on his arm and smiles
kris at his computer and in the zone
fingers flying over the keys passionately
on his desk is a cardboard box filled with letters all shapes and sizes on the verge of overflowing the top of the box
one the side of the box are the words labor of love fan mail
dawn in indiana the sun spills over the horizon
maurice and officer grey are seated on the front stairs of the precinct drinking coffee when adelle matlin drives up
adelle steps out of a rented toyota celica
her tense frightened eyes betray her mental state for the past ten hours
she walks to the stairs
maurice slowly gets up
adelle is in shock as she looks at the stranger before her
maurice stands in a colts football t shirt faded jeans and sneakers
his left cheek is black and blue and his arm and side are bandaged
uncle maurice youre wearing sneakers
high top nike cross trainers with heel support and air cushioned soles
adelle wasnt sure what that meant
she shakes it off and hugs maurice
she is visibly relieved to have him in her arms
my shift ended an hour ago
adelle notices the rose in greys hand
grey catches her glance
its for my wife
whats the occasion
grey looks to maurice they exchange a knowing smile
adelle notices the wink exchanged between grey and maurice
you can use the conference room if you want to talk
that wont be necessary
we can talk on the way back i rented a car
itll be kind of hard to talk since youll be in the car and i wont
adelle gives maurice an angry glare maurice holds his ground
the conference room is down the hall on your right
file cabinets in the corners
a small rectangle table takes up ninety percent of the space in the room
maurice is seated his legs extended straight on another chair
adelle paces the front of the room
and your store
what about your new store
what about all your dreams
i have new dreams now
i dont accept that
maybe one day after youve been married twenty years youll understand
uncle maurice i spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here
i have a rented car outside just listen to me
beat come back with me now and if you still want to do something like this in a year maybe well plan a car trip across the country gerald and
i will come along i have to walk by myself all the way every inch
its what she asked for
its what im going to do
she was being symbolic
what if she asked you to fly to the moon
youd be visiting me at nasa
adelle changes gears
she takes a seat next to maurice and studies his legs and tired face carefully before uttering the words
whispering what if you dont make it
ill make it
if you really want to do this
plan it out
train for it
build up your body
plan every stop along the way
how much money
really do it properly
this is all so by the seat of your pants
no its not
why did you take the back roads here
theyre not safe
youd know that if youd planned
ive all ready gone six hundred miles
i cant do it again
if you cant redo these six hundred miles when youre rested and ready how are you possible going to walk another two thousand five hundred miles in your present condition
maurice is stumped
he looks unsure
he instantly looks on the verge of tears
nothings going to happen
uncle the way i was told if that police car didnt happen down that road you would be dead right now
that guy denny had jumped bail in another state hes dangerous
theyll be other dennys if you dont plan
maurice stares down at the table the life draining from him with every word she says
ellen deserves you to do this right
really make it if youre going to do it
she deserves it
the rented toyota celica turns out of the police station onto the main road
adelle holds a cushion in the air as she looks in the rearview mirror
do you want this
its a long ride
maurice is stretched out in the back his legs propped up on a blanket
maurice shakes his head no silently
his sad eyes watching the passing scenery
the speeding car swallows up the miles effortlessly
maurice watches the jackson liquor wholesalers whiz by
the painful hills he climbed gone in an instant
the school where he watched the children being dropped off swishes by in a blink
all those miles lost
maurice shuts his eyes in pain
the rented toyota celica is parked at the convenience store
maurice is seated in the back staring out at the eighteen wheelers that come in and out of the parking lot
he glances in to adelle who is gathering food
maurices dull eyes are about to shut when something catches his attention
he sits up and stares out the window with great intensity
maurice watches as a large truck pulls into the parking lot across its side in blazing red jackson liquor wholesalers since maurice scans the area
gas station attendants
a bearded homeless man laying next to a heating unit
kids eating fast food on old picnic tables
maurices gaze steadies on the truck as the driver fills the tank with gas
adelle is on the phone
well figure everything out when we get there
oh hes going to need a lot of help with this
he wasnt even going to come with me i had to tell him that he could do the walk later if he plans well
i know but by that time ill have gotten him some treatment
i just want to get back home before he changes his mind
adelle gets in the front seat of the car keeping the bag of food on the passenger seat
she starts the car as she talks into the rearview mirror
you want something to eat
she stares at maurice covered in a blanket with his back to her
an unresponsive blob
i know youre feeling a lot of emotions right now
its okay to be mad
its okay to feel helpless
its part of the healing process
adelle puts the celica into drive and pulls out onto the highway
evening in philadelphia
the rented toyota celica pulls into the driveway
the front door of the house opens
gerald walks out to greet them
a tired adelle slips out of the car and hugs gerald
he was exhausted slept the whole way
adelle and gerald move to the back door of the celica
they open it and stare at maurice covered by the blanket
adelle shakes the blanket
uncle maurice were home
adelle shakes maurice who stirs a little as he wakes
his feet slide out from under the blanket adelle stares curiously at the army combat boots that dangle out
adelle pulls aside the covers
the homeless man from the gas station sits up
adelles shrill scream blasts through the air
gerald and adelle stumble back as the large bearded man struggles out of the car and looks around the quiet neighborhood
so this is the city of brotherly love
the homeless man raises his hand
he holds up maurices well polished book society medallion and kisses it lovingly
adelle and gerald stare back speechless
jackson wholesalers parking lot
the truck from the gas station the only vehicle parked before the store
maurice back on the road
his limp only slightly visible at this point in the day
the bandages rubbing him with every step
the highway takes him around a beautiful bend of trees
the air is filled with the sounds of birds
maurice spots a yellow warbler a striking bird about eight inches long with vivid yellow feathers
it sits elegantly on a nearby branch
he walks towards it it stays in position
the bird chirps back at him
maurice is within arms reach of the bird
ellen would have loved you
maurice looks closer and notices its wings
the feathers bend back a dark area at the center
how did that happen
maurice watches the bird hop around the branch unable to fly
the kitchen is a different color
the refrigerator and appliances are brand new
ellen walks in something cradled in her hand
maurice looks up from his paper to see ellen move to the sink and lay a motionless bird on the counter
shaky voice it mustve hit the window
i think its neck is broken
dont bring it in here it probably has all kinds of diseases
ellen finds an eye dropper from the table and fills it with water she lets a few drops fall into the birds mouth
evening just before bed
maurice is reading
ellen is monitoring the bird closely
it lays on the bedside table wrapped gently with a hand towel
a morsel of food is lowered into its mouth with a pair of tweezers
the bird stares blankly at the ceiling
it isnt going to make it ellen
let the poor thing go quietly
itll make it
her delicate hand rubs the birds stomach
the graphic images of the tv flicker on maurices face
he glances back to ellen who talks to the bird cradled in her arms
softly you must miss flying
being way up there in the clouds looking down at all of us
you miss that dont you
you miss playing with your friends and talking with them
in the soft light of the lamp ellen has transformed into a mother rocking her child to sleep
maurice is reading his paper
come out here
maurice looks through the window to see ellen waving to him frantically
ellen points to the ground
the little bird awkwardly walks around the porch
the birds wings burst into motion flapping hard catching the wind
ellen jumps up and down bursting with pride as her little child takes flight
i dont believe it
ellen hugs maurice
all he needed was love
once you have that you can do anything
young maurice and ellen watch the bird soar into the blue sky
maurice is kneeling at a stream by the side of the road
he gently clears away the dirt from the yellow warblers feathers
youll be all right
a couple days and youll be up there again
maurice carries the bird back to the trees
he lays it back on the branch
he stares at its beautiful coat with a smile
ellen would have loved you
adelle is on the cordless
her fingers tapping on the kitchen table angrily
gerald moves around her as he sets two plates at the table
yes i understand it does sound humorous but this is a very serious situation
gerald is cooking
he gently flips the chicken breast in a butter and garlic sauce
this smells good
why am i such an authority
under his breath here comes the resume
i received my b
from the university of pennsylvania my p
from bryn mawr college
i worked three years at the boston university school of medicine during which time i had articles printed in the journal of educational psychology american journal of psychology psychology review
so i think its safe to say my opinion is valid
gerald brings the sizzling pan over and divides the steaming dish into both plates
look please find him for me
officer i tried
but i brought back the wrong person
gerald quickly scoops some rice onto both plates
his mouth is watering as he goes for the utensils
adelle abruptly stands at her place
gerald gets into his seat at the table just in time to see adelle angrily hang up the phone
she stares off into space before unconsciously cleaning the table
adelle picks up both plates of food
adelle geralds heart sinks as adelle pops open the trash can with a tap of her foot and dumps the picture perfect meal into the garbage
she goes to the sink and rinses the plates completely preoccupied with her thoughts
she mumbles to herself as she shuts off the water
he says he admires him
adelle storms out of the kitchen
gerald sits at the empty table with a fork in his hands
he shakes his head in disbelief
the land is flat
from the roads one can see endless fields in all directions
when the wind blows the crops bend in unison changing the shape and texture of the land for a moment and instantly changing back with a snap of the wind
maurice takes in the beauty of the land through a painful grimace
occasionally clutching his right leg in moments of extreme pain
maurice rests on an abandoned tractor by the side of the road and watches the wind change the fields
he closes his jacket as the gusts become stronger
the clock clicks past am
maurice is still in bed the curtains drawn
he crawls out from under the sheets and downs two pills with a glass of water
he looks bad
his face pale his eyes at half mast
he wipes unnatural sweat from his brow and melts into the bed again
just after dusk
a small towns main road
maurice quietly passes under the street lights
he stares up and tightens the hood on his parka as the first snowflake falls into the shaft of the street light
soon thousands of flakes fall into the light
kris fields calls frantically as the lights blink anxiously on his phone
the front page of the gazette is posted on his pin up board
he marches on
underneath is a picture of maurice standing outside his bookstore holding up the book society medallion proudly
a teenage boy gets off the elevator and maneuvers an enormous bag over his shoulder
emblazoned across his back are the words mail room
the boy comes to kris and empties the bag on kris desk without a word
hundreds of letters cascade down swallowing the table top and covering kris who stares in awe as the letters keep coming
maurice is coughing painfully
he crouches over the edge of the bed and holds his side with every strain
maurice looks worse than ever
his hair and shirt are soaked with sweat
the coughing attack stops
maurice take a couple deep breaths before laying back down
his feet are visible sticking out from beneath the sheets
they look like someone has beaten them with a stick swollen and bruised
they disappear under the sheets
that stretch into a white oblivion
the branches of the trees are encapsulated in ice
the snow piled ten inches on every surface
maurice buried deep beneath three layers of clothes looks around
his breath materializes with every step
he forces a weak smile at the magical landscape before him
the sounds of a volvo station wagon urges maurice to the side of the road
as it passes a little girl waves from the passenger window
maurice puts on a brave face and waves back
another car enters the picture a dark blue firebird rises over the hill in the opposite lane moving fast too fast
slow motion as the firebird skids over the ice and the snow the driver desperately trying to gain control
the mother in the volvo hits the brakes as the firebird spins into her lane
maurice yells out
the cars impact with a sickening crunch back to real time the firebird spins into a guardrail breaking through it and coming to a stop in a bank of snow
the volvo isnt so lucky
it flips from the impact
sliding on its roof driving through the snow down the road
it comes to a rest a hundred feet away
the entire event took only seconds
maurice runs frantically after the volvo
the windows are shattered
snow has packed into the over turned car
no one can be seen inside the vehicle
maurice kneels down and punctures the wall of snow with his hand
his arm disappears up to the shoulder
his face grimacing with the strain
his arm comes out slowly
a few muffled sobs are heard before the little girl breaks through the wall of snow and slides out of the window
she lets out a desperate gasp for air as maurice pulls her out by the wrist
maurice clears her mouth and face and watches as she coughs
panting its okay
its all over
maurice lays her gently against a snow bank before moving to the other side of the car
is she okay
maurice looks up to see the driver of the firebird walking towards him
he looks dazed
maurice doesnt waste another second and plunges his arm in the snow
deeper than before
his cheek pressed against the snow almost laying flat on the ground
frantic oh no
shes wearing a seat belt
maurice fishes around
his teeth clenched
he lets out a powerful grunt as he pulls back with all his strength a womans wrist appears first then the tangled hair and then the body spills out onto
the road next to maurice
the driver appears over the woman and maurice and loses it when he sees them
it wasnt my fault
it wasnt my fault
maurice out of breath clears the womans face and mouth no movement
maurice holds her nose and breaths into her mouth
she doesnt respond
the mothers unconscious face turns into ellen
her lifeless eyes her bruised cheek and forehead
her neck at an awkward angle
maurice stares down at his wife in horror
being revived by maurice
he pushes her chest in counting
push count breath
push count breath
the mothers body twitches slightly at first then obviously
the mother lets out a few painful coughs
she takes a breath
life quickly returns to her body
maurice places her head in his lap and hugs her lightly rocking back and forth
the tears streaming down his red face
everythings going to be fine ellen
i wont let anything happen to you
i love you sweetie
everythings going to be different now
the scene backs out as maurice comforts this stranger in his arms
the police have descended on the scene
traffic has been blocked off in both directions
the light thrown by the ambulances tints the snow and fields a throbbing red
maurices face can be seen in the shadows of the backseat of a police car
officer hansen and officer tandy converse
whats his story
his name is maurice
hes dancing around everything else
red flag man
if hes in trouble with the law fine
not our problem
he yanked two people from a car wreck lets give him some space
hansen looks in at the drawn exhausted face of maurice through the window
hansen opens the back door
maurice you need anything
which way were you headed
we can drive you
no thank you officer
hansen throws a sharp glance to tandy
hansen turns back to maurice
how about food
our dime at the local diner
maurice mulls this offer
come on man youre a hero
in nebraska we dont let heros walk around with empty stomachs
i need to be brought back here
the end of the meal
maurice sits in a booth across from hansen and tandy
they watch as maurice coughs violently into his napkin
you look like shit maurice
maurice takes a couple strained breaths
how long have you been footing it maurice
looks around excuse me gentlemen
maurice gets up and heads to the bathroom
hansen and tandy stare at maurices shoulder bag laying on his seat
red flags man
not our problem
why so vague
why so evasive
he could be somebody hot
not our problem
its going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the steadmans house
this guys not a murderer
if he is half the town has seen us take him out for dinner like a couple of jack asses
that makes tandy think
if hes clean hell never know about it
tandy looks to the mens bathroom door
do it quick
hansen instantly reaches over and begins rummaging through the shoulder bag
hansen pulls out a little folder
he opens the folder to reveal an old certificate
hansen shows tandy the worn piece of paper
a marriage certificate
who the hell carries their marriage certificate around
maurice and ellen parker
it was issued in philly
maurice parker has come a long way from home
hansen returns the certificate and folder to the bag and leaves the booth quickly
maurice returns to the table to find only tandy seated
maurice sees hansen in the phone booth at the far end of the diner
has to call his wife every two hours or shell go ballistic when he gets home
p a r k e r
get on the horn with philly
call me here
sergeant dally packs his things to leave
he sees the light on line light up on his phone
he ignores it
the clerk sticks her head around the corner
line one sarg
im not here
dally zips his coat
its the nebraska state police
you know somebody named maurice parker
he shakes his head as he unzips his jacket
smiles that son of a bitch made it to nebraska
dally grabs the phone
crackles with the voice of sergeant dally and the michelle a very introverted intern stares at the radio astonished
it now has kris reddy etched on its door
kris looks up from his desk at michelle who stands in the doorway bright red
what is it
michelle just points down the hall
michelle scribbles down notes
he saved a little girl and her mother
pulled them right out of the car
kris stands jaw hanging wide open
where is he
michelle checks her notes
very soft voice umm elm creek nebraska
kris practically falls over
michelle scribbles down more quotes
this story is big huh
the gazettes small huh
what are you saying
this story is too big for this paper
flustered again umm no
its just that god damn youre right
you dont say much michelle but what you say is golden
kris mind is racing as the c
hansen scoffs down his third dessert
maurice stares at him oddly
the pay phone rings
hansen jumps to his feet too quickly
he tries to recover
too excited i was expecting a call
hansen moves to the phone
tandy winks at maurice with a smile
hansen listens carefully to the officer on the line
im on first name basis with half the city of philadelphia
hansen apparently this guy parker lost his wife and went a little fruity
i spoke with his niece adelle matlin and she says to restrain him
that hes dangerous to himself
she says to call when we have him in the station
the ride progresses in silence
hansen and tandy in the front seat
maurices head is pressed against the back seat window
his eyes begin to shut slightly as sleep overcomes him
the car goes over a bump
maurice jars awake
he glances out the window to see a highway sign swish by in the east
maurice looks around quickly at the passing scenery
where are you taking me
hansen and tandy exchange looks
im going to drop off tandy at the station and then drop you back
thats all right isnt it
hansen looks back to the road
the drive continues in silence
tandy checks his watch just when a click a hard wind and a metallic slam in quick succession shakes the car
what the hell was that
tandy looks back maurice is gone
the back seat empty
tandy stares out the blackness of the back window
out of the car
he jumped out of the god damn car
maurice staggers through the naked trees
thin trees every few feet with no branches
the snow ankle deep
maurice braces himself against a trunk checking his hands
his vision blurs as he stares down at his scraped bloody palms
the forest clears quickly into an open field
far in the distance across the field of white is a small pointed building standing alone
the glow of a light can be seen through the windows
maurice trudges through the deeper snow
stumbling many times
the frigid wind pushing him to his knees
maurice keeps moving the field seems endless
maurices feet hit the snow of the driveway just as his legs buckle his face hits the snow hard
he manages to roll over on his back with great effort
he stares up at the pointed building the dull light becoming duller
something blocks the light
maurice feels himself rise into the air as two powerful arms scoop him off the ice
a priest carries him into the doors of a church
a dimly lit cathedral
six foot six father berchman walks down the center isle of the cathedral through a cloth curtain and into a where maurice is sitting in a chair wrapped in a
what did they ask
if i had seen you
by the way im sorry about your wife
they told me
im sorry you had to lie
it must have been difficult
i asked the officers if you had committed some crime
if they had said yes you would be speaking with them right now
this is the fathers own room
very sparse as one would expect
he moves to his bureau and retrieves some pills
take these and if youre up to it try to explain how it is you came to be sitting here
maurice follows the fathers instructions and tightens the blanket around his shoulders
im walking for my wife
the father nods as if this is not shocking news
do you believe a persons soul lives on after their death
and that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them
thats a reasonable assumption
i dont want my wifes soul having any doubts
about my love for her
the father nods with understanding as if everything became very clear with that statement
you dont have to prove anything to her
im not proving to her
im showing her
and i know i dont have to
i want to
ive realized love is about giving
im alive i can still give to her
i want to give her everything i can
the father studies this stranger before him with great admiration
there are some people including those officers that are trying to stop me
they mean well
but they dont understand
i wouldnt either if i were them
maurice struggles with the last words
he slumps back physically drained
the father gets up and takes the empty glass of water from maurices hands
i want you to stay here a few days until youre better
youre no use to your wife in this condition
the father moves for the curtain
you think im crazy too
the father turns and smiles warmly
i have spent my life dedicated to love
love of god
love of humanity
and here you are living through love
bathing in it
using its strength its magic its ability to overcome any barrier
if you are crazy i hope my insanity is not far off
maurices eyes well up instantly
father berchman wraps one powerful hand around a tiny silver cross dangling from his neck
the other hand waves high into the air at the shrinking figure of maurice parker walking through the snow
the long trek continues
the black tar of the roads peek out in spots as the sun beats down on the flatlands
maurice drapes his worn scarf around a melting snowman
we are looking inside a fancy center city philadelphia restaurant
adelle and gerald are seated by an enormous bay window
a waiter comes to their table with their main course
gerald watches the food being served with great anticipation
geralds eyes drift out the window to the magazine stand on the sidewalk
he squints to see better
realization hits hard
his eyes light up
he looks to adelle and back to the magazine stand
in a mad race for time gerald begins to devour the food on his plate
the waiter and adelle watch him in shock
adelle glances out the window
her eyes squint
then light up
she jumps to her feet and grabs gerald by the arm a fork full of food drops to his plate
gerald looks back at his full plate longingly as adelle pulls him out of the restaurant
the waiter looks out the window to the magazine stand
the new york times are hung like stockings around the border of the stand
on the front pages a singular headline stands out among the others a large photo of maurice is next to the headline
a red headed waitress slices a credit card through the machine and waits
green computer letters blink this account has been closed
the waitress returns with the card she shakes her head no at maurice who digs into his wallet for cash
maurice slides two twenties across the counter to the motel manager
maurice checks the remaining bills in his wallet
only a few bills left
in the motel room we find maurice sitting over the edge of a bed buckled over in a coughing attack
it finally stops
maurice flops back to the pillows completely drained
the flatlands have vanished
the roads now serpentine through mountain ranges
view from the mountain range maurice moves like a grain of dust over the black line of the road
maurice rests every half mile
he labors up every incline with ultimate effort
he braces himself with a branch serving as a make due crutch
maurice spots a small town nestled in the arms of the mountain range
he begins the journey to rest
maurice pays for his food with the last few bills in his wallet
another stick serves as a walking cane
the multi layers of clothes have been shed for a short sleeve shirt
maurice follows a dirt road that breaks free of the mountains and into the open country again
a dust covered mailbox at the end of a long dirt driveway
maurice wipes the mailbox clean with his hand
the name emerges like an ancient inscription from beneath the mud
maurice tentatively moving to the front door
his hand instinctively clutches his empty stomach
the wind blows gently
maurice shuts his eyes and takes a deep breath
he opens his eyes slowly to see a dinner table being set
potatoes gravy fresh baked bread
floating through the half open window to maurices thankful smile
the first light knocks go unheard with all the commotion
the door squeaks open
maurice puts on his best smile
the door opens wider no one stands before him
maurice looks down to find an adorable little boy black hair big eyes and an even bigger grin
this is three year old isaac caldwell
im maurice parker
im much older than three
are your parents home
you know what i can play baseball with my brothers when im bigger
is that right
you know what
im just little now but ill be big soon
youll probably be bigger than your brothers
isaac is happy with this thought
maurice looks up as mrs
caldwell comes to the door
who are you talking to isaac
caldwell stops as she stares at maurice
hello im maurice parker
im just passing through and i need to conserve what little funds i have
i need some food and a roof to sleep under for one night
now i dont look like much but if there are any things that need to get done around the house mrs
caldwell doesnt listen but instead yells behind the door
youre not going to believe whos here
maurice looks at her oddly
caldwell comes to the door his face lights up
this is maurice parker the one walking for his wife
caldwell is completely floored
so for that matter is maurice
caldwell puts out his hand with awe
if that aint fate
hi im dave caldwell
i do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here
we did a piece after your story ran in the new york times
maurice is truly surprised
new york times
caldwell ushers maurice in the doorway by the elbow
someone said they spotted you in town
parker youre a celebrity
the caldwell family dinner
all twelve of them
ten children talk and reach for food
maurice sits at the end talking enjoying and sharing
isaac sits next to him proudly
maurice has blended in as another member of this family
an inviting room
the kind prepared for visiting grandmothers and grandfathers to stay in
maurice checks himself out in the mirror
his borrowed pajamas fit nicely
he moves to the window and stares at the moon lit landscape
enormous endless dwarfing
the rocking chair creaks as maurice melts into it
he rubs his calves slowly the pain evident in his face
his head leans back after a moment
on the verge of sleep
the sound of tiny footsteps stirs him
he looks to the doorway to find isaac standing quietly at the door in his baseball p
i thought you were asleep
you know what
i remembered you were here and i woke up
isaac walks silently to maurice
tip toeing all the way
your parents would want you to be in bed
you tell stories
im not good at that
very bad in fact
isaac climbs up into maurices lap with great effort
maurice looks down at isaac who waits patiently for him to begin
i would be exceedingly boring
i dont do these type of things
isaac still waiting
see there are two kinds of people in this world
beat just a short one okay
isaac gets in position cradled in maurices arms
maurice searches for something to say
there was a boy named isaac who wanted to play baseball but he was too small and no one would let him play
but he kept practicing by himself waiting
he went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove
you know what
maybe i ran onto the field and hit a home run
whos telling this story
isaac points to maurice
good now the team had this great big player big billy
he was the best
he had them in the world super bowl championship of little kids baseball
but right before the game the second best player on the team was suspended because he played a prank on a nice man who owned a book store
when that boy grew up he was convicted on burglary charges and spent fifteen years in prison where he belongs
isaac didnt understand that last part
anyway big billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands
who can play baseball
and there was a little voice that yelled out me i can play
everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove
beaming thats me
but everyone saw how small isaac was and laughed
but not big billy
he stared at isaac carefully and then told him to join the game
it came to the end of the game
it was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game
big billys team was losing and he was on base
thats when isaac came up
he could barely hold the bat
big billy winked at isaac
the ball was pitched isaac hit the ball hard
it soared up and out over the stadium
isaac hit a home run and won the game
after the game isaac asked big billy why he let he play
big billy smiled and said i wasnt always big billy i was little billy first
isaac and big billy went off after the game and read a classic book together
you know what that was a really good story
tell it again
maurice has to smile as isaac looks up anxiously
there was a boy named isaac who liked to play baseball
we back out as maurice rocks back and forth in his chair
isaac falling asleep in his arms
the family dog max scurries up and down with great excitement
max can sense something big is happening
the caldwell clan one and all has gathered at the end of their driveway
maurice is escorted out by isaac who clings tightly to his hand
caldwell meets maurice halfway and pulls him aside
thats a nice watch
maurice looks down at his beat up seiko
ive always wanted a watch like that
unstrapping it its yours
i wont take it unless i pay for it
lets see thats a pretty nice watch i can see that
maurice watches him suspiciously as he pulls out an envelope from his jacket pocket
lets say i give you whats in this envelope for that beautiful watch
maurice is handed the envelope
he opens it to find a thick i really want that watch
this isnt right
this is my only chance to get a watch like that
it would mean a lot to me and my family
please take it
it really isnt that much
maurice stares into the envelope emotionally and hands over the watch tentatively
this is a loan
caldwell straps on the watch and then hugs maurice
the rest of the family say their good byes
isaac wont let go of maurices hand as he walks out into the street
isaac come back here
isaac just holds on tighter
after maurice and isaac have walked a few steps out into the street maurice kneels down
i have to go now
isaacs bottom lip protrudes as he tries not to cry
maurice has to hold back a few tears himself
he hugs isaac tightly
whispers why didnt i meet you fifteen years ago
maurice pulls away from isaac slowly
isaac runs to his mothers arms
maurice waves good bye to the caldwells as he heads down the road
maurice stops bends down to the road and picks up a torn white paper streamer that spiraled its way to his feet
he looks ahead and finds both sides of the street lined with parked cars
some of the cars are decorated with white streamers
a beautiful canopy of flowers sits at the end of ten rows of lawn chairs
maurice watches from near the cars
he smiles as the young bride and groom nervously say their vows
everyone laughs warmly as the groom stumbles over his lines
moments before the ceremony
the guests are seated
the organ is playing
young maurice sits on a chair in a tuxedo staring out the half open door to an old man who tries to gain his balance by holding onto the wall
maurice is upset
he runs his fingers through his hair
the door opens wide as young ellen comes in
she is wearing her wedding gown
white lace tight at the arms and waist she looks stunning
they said something was wrong
maurice stares at his rented shoes
ellen moves to him and kneels before him
she lifts his chin
everything looks beautiful
they even got the white dove i wanted for the cake so whats wrong
what is it
maurice moves his gaze from her to the half open door
ellen looks back
thats okay really it is
no its not
he should be here with me now not trying to find some fucking bottle of johnny walker
hes never been there for me
ive always been alone
maurice looks like he may cry
im afraid ellen
im scared of being alone again
what if one day you realize how boring i am
what if one day you realize youre not happy
beat i could have been alone before but now youve changed things
i cant be alone anymore ellen
im scared whats going to happen to me
ellen takes both his hands and squeezes them between hers
the day i met you i gave you my heart
today i give you my soul
where ever you are where ever you go i will be with you
maurice parker i promise she shakes him with emphasis i promise you will never be alone again
the bride and groom run through a shower of rice into their limousine
they wave through the window as the car pulls away
they settle in and look to the seat across from them
on the seat is a fresh flower
next to the flower is a note
the groom picks it up and shows it to the bride
it reads it is signed m
the bride and groom look at each other curiously
the limousine passes maurice on the road as he walks
a fax machine rolls out a tongue of information
michelle the intern snatches it and jogs through the maze of desks
michelle catches the tail end of a telephone conversation
come on pete this is important this is racism in our backyard
aw thats bull
just think about it okay
kris hangs up
theyre pushing my jewish temple vandalism story to the metro section
kris notices michelles familiar bright red face
michelle is completely flustered as usual
thats it what is it talk to me
hands the fax over umm coalville utah
kris studies the fax before jumping up from his desk and moving to the wall
an enormous u
map covers three quarters of the wall
red tacks mark a trail across the united states beginning with philadelphia
kris puts a red tack at the top right corner of utah
kris notices through the open officer door that frank and seth are listening in
kris nods to michelle
who immediately shuts the door on their view
kris waves bye before it closes
hes taking highway all the way
kris paces the room charged with excitement eyes occasionally stopping on the map
michelle watches kris animated expressions
you know what this is dont you
its a miracle
it was a miracle little johnny passed his math test
this is a real miracle
turning water to wine kind of miracle
people should know about this everyone every single person
its time for a blitz
lets see what kind of tv interest we can generate
michelle enjoys watching kris when hes like this
umm hes going to make it isnt he
kris studies the map
but he hasnt hit the toughest miles yet
the lights are out
the flicker from the tv dances over adelle and gerald
adelle is fast asleep
gerald is having a late night sandwich
nightline comes on the tv
what would you do for love
this is the question americans are starting to ask themselves
the incredible tale of maurice parkers walk across the country has caught the imaginations of young and old
he puts the sandwich on the plate and hands it to his left obediently
pan to left to find adelle wide awake now
she glares at the tv screen silently as she takes the sandwich and dumps it in the waste basket releasing some of her frustration
a computer map of the u
trails maurices walk on the screen
at this bookstore owner from wynnewood pennsylvania has tallied an estimated miles
his latest appearance in coalville utah brought the spotlight of the country to that small town
i cant believe it
whatever has carried mr
parker through snow and rain and thousands of miles of this countryside will have to carry him through the most dangerous part of his trek
the three hundred miles through the sweltering roads of nevada
a merciless sun beats down on a long stretch of highway
the black tar from the road melting slightly
no sign of maurice
we see into the distance not a soul in sight
we look to a hillside a hundred meters from the road
there we see a figure lying still in the shade of an overhanging rock formation
maurice has a towel over his eyes and his feet propped up on his shoulder bag
he is fast asleep
the sun turns red for one brilliant moment before hiding behind the horizon
like an alarm went off maurice wakes up and packs his things
the moonlight outlines a line figure hobbling his way step by step with a walking stick
the air fills with a powerful rumble
maurice turns to see a wave of rocks and sand slide down a hillside to the road
they cause a great thunder that settles to dust
maurice walks down the center of the highway away from the hillside
the fiery nevada sun begins its ascent into the sky
maurice looks bad
hes breathing heavy as he moves up a steep incline by the side of the road
his feet slide on the loose dirt
maurice looks like he could collapse at any moment
he makes it to the indentation in the hillside just enough room to lay down in the shade
maurice lays out slowly
he pries off his sneakers band aids and blisters cover every inch of his feet
maurice dumps the sand out of his sneakers and painfully pulls them back on
his eyes close as he tries to unbutton his jacket
too late hes asleep
maurices bed is a rock that juts from the side of the hill
first we see nothing then some grains of sand escape from the crack where the rock meets the hillside
the crack fraction of an inch
it stabilizes there
maurice unaware of his precarious situation sleeps twenty five feet above the ground
temperatures in the nineties
the sun is directly overhead
maurice stirs in his sleep moving closer to the edge of the rock
maurice wakes up as he begins to slide off
hands scraping at the dirt
he slides off the rock
feet and hands desperately trying to cling to the hillside
he picks up speed as he tumbles down
maurice looks down in time to see a small jut in the rock hurtling towards him
no time for panic
a sickening crack of bone as maurice hits the rock square in the ribs
maurice flops down the rest of the slope like a rag doll
he comes to rest in the dirt clutching his ribs
the sun beats down on his stunned eyes
maurice stares up at the dizzying slope
sand still trickling down to a stop
he doesnt try to move for the first few seconds
his breathing increasingly erratic
maurice drags himself to sit upright
the sharp pains causing a distorted grimace on his face
a short rest before working his way to his feet
maurice uses a highway guardrail as a backrest
he takes a seat in the dirt
maurices hair is damp with sweat
his breathing relegated to slow gasps
his left hand covering his rib cage protectively
blood begins to trickle through the spaces between his fingers
maurice closes his eyes for a moment before his bent leg goes into spasms
maurice is forced to straighten the leg instantly
jarring his tender rib cafe
maurice clings to the back of his thigh
maurice is defeated
on the verge of tears
he glances way down the road and spots a tiny cloud of smoke miles away in the distance
a car is moving in his direction
maurice looks up into the dazzling white sky
drops of sweat falling into his eyes
whisper its over ellen
i failed you again
maurice looks down the road at the cloud of dust growing larger
i tried ellen i really tried
i dont have the strength
the cloud is now clearly a car
maurice stares up into the sky again
the tears racing the sweat down his cheeks
maurice yells to the heavens
you said i would never be alone
his yelling turns to sobs you promised
maurices is interrupted by a slight rustling behind his head
maurice turns and looks through his tears
there a few feet from him perched quietly and majestically on the guardrail is a golden eagle
it stands two and half feet tall
it spreads its great wings
the feathers expand like a blanket spanning six feet and throwing a gentle shade on maurices face
maurice is frozen in wonder
the magic of the moment glows in his eyes
maurices face gains life
the dark feathered eagle stands like a god before maurice
the moment is breathtaking
the car on the road takes the last quarter mile in seconds
screeching its brakes at the sight of maurice on the side of the road
maurice turns away from the bird as the car pulls up
the driver gets out and calls over the hood
hey man are you okay
maurices face filled with strength
he grins through the pain
what the hell are you doing out here
you need a ride somewhere
no thank you
the driver is concerned
he opens the driver door
you by yourself
this pacifies the driver somewhat
he nods and gets in the car
maurice watches as the car pulls away
he turns back to the guardrail the eagle is gone
maurice looks up into the sky
the golden eagle is flying overhead
a tiny dot against the blazing sun
maurice struggles to his feet using the guardrail as support
maurice takes his first step
rows of similar houses with small lawns and custom mailboxes
beautiful trees line the streets creating a canopy over the roadway
two women sit on a swing on the front porch of a small suburban home
janis and ammies conversation is cut in mid sentence
who is that
i dont know
whats the matter with him
janis and ammie stare to the street where a sunburnt maurice staggers in a daze
maurice is on the edge of darkness
the trees and faces swimming mixed with the colors of red and blue cloth waving in the wind
images come in and out of focus
two women walking towards him
maurice clutches his head as the trees start to swim faster color lights houses
maurice collapses in the middle of this suburban street
janis and ammie run to his side
maurice lays still on a hospital bed
his eyes slowly force themselves open
good morning mr
maurice turns his head to the side
a pretty woman in her late twenties with large locks of brown hair smiles back
this is stephanie
there are a lot of people worried about you
softly where am i
in a hospital
did you take me back
stephanie understands his worry
you are in st
vincents hospital in roseville california
youve been here three days
maurice closes his eyes in relief
the room is crowded
maurice is now propped up in a seated position
he tries to digest a set of fish sticks on a tray
i cant believe youre here
maurice looks across to adelle and gerald
are you two planning kids
you should definitely have children
theyre really special
adelle and gerald are in shock
maurice forks another fish stick with a smile
i dont think you realize how serious this is uncle
how serious is it
ray who has been standing by the window listening steps forward
you have two broken ribs a punctured spleen and acute rheumatoid arthritis
maurice gives a comforting smile to adelle
the normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion
this is called claudication as a result there isnt enough circulation to your body
that accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms im sure youve encountered
can it kill me
it can but itll have to wait in line
this surprises maurice
we ran a c
and an m
we found bleeding in your brain
your collapse was caused by transient cerebral ischemia
a sudden loss of blood circulation to the brain
in other words mr
parker you had a mild stroke
there is dead silence in the room
scared i suppose i over did it
adelle moves over to maurices side and holds his hand
what steps do we take now
we find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding
i just did this procedure on a senator and hes doing fine
what are the odds
do i have a fifty fifty chance of surviving the operation
its hard to say
its a delicate surgery
theres no getting around the fact that its a very high risk situation
adelle strokes maurices hair
maurice stares down at his food before looking up with great resolve
then itll have to wait until i finish
i finish the walk and then we may take all the chances we want
the room is stunned
adelle gets off the bed and collects herself
listen to me very carefully because i dont want you to misunderstand me
the walk is over uncle maurice
youve made it to california it was a miracle now lets try to save your life
louder im completing the walk
im almost there
okay maurice keep it calm
beat we can talk about this again but just so you know we have a guard on this floor whos sole job it is to keep an eye on you
maurice is crushed
there are a lot of people out there who would like to see you finish including me but im not willing to put your life in anymore risk than it
we do the operation and when youre better you finish the walk
the room is dead again
maurice drowns in his thoughts
a small chapel
stain glass windows overlooking the parking lot
maurice sits in his wheel chair at the back of the room
a few other patients are scattered in the four small pews
maurice has his hands folded tightly and stares up at the statue of mary
his concentration is broken as a man in a full black suit and black shirt sits next to him
maurice nods at the priest
how are you feeling
im not sure what to do now
im not sure what he wants for me
he wants to reward you
thats why im here
a little confused what do you mean
i mean youve done a great thing
you should be rewarded monetarily
maurice is lost
whats your shoe size
who are you
the priest reaches into his jacket for the first time we see a polo design on his shirt and a gaudy gold chain around his neck
clive silver marketing executive at reebok
maurice stares at the card in disbelief
we want you to do some spots for us
what the hell is this
some of the patients turn around
im talking six figures pay or play for two spots
we want to push a new line with you
americas new hero
maurice is flustered
he cant take this
his eyes become desperate
clive waves his hands in the air excitedly
imagine grainy black and white shots of long stretches of highway quick cuts with a slow pounding beat underneath
then we see a man walking up a steep incline its you maurice
we see shots of you walking
music crescendoes bham
close up and you say
reebok because theres nothing you cant do
he is surprised to find maurice in tears
clive is thrown totally off as maurice stares at him angrily through streaming tears
my wife is dead
maurice continues his powerful gaze until clive looks away
clive gathers his things and leaves the chapel without another word
maurice drops his head into his hands and cries quietly
a change of shifts
stephanie gathers her things
she lifts her coat off the counter
underneath is a paper
she spins the paper to face her
the headline reads the end of a journey parker hospitalized
stephanie peeks into the dark room
whispers good night mr
ill see you tomorrow
stephanie waits for a response from the motionless figure on the bed
she leaves the room a little disappointed
we move closer to the bed
we see maurice laying still the battered photo of ellen clutches to his chest
stephanie is wheeling maurice down the hall
maurice has a glint of happiness in his eye
they move through the doors marked visitors area
maurice stretches a huge grin as kris reddy gets up from a chair
kris bends down and hugs maurice emotionally
the grapes of wrath
maurice and kris seated in the corner of the room
i missed you kris
i missed you to mr
adelle told me your writing is going well
the crusader for social issues and all
you were right
from the heart is always better
i drove by the bookstore its boarded up now
theres a sign over the wood office space available
the loss is evident on maurices eyes
i havent been too punctual with the rent
i was thinking you could open another store with investors
im sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now
maurice forces a smile
actually im not worried about my career right now
im more worried about how youre getting me out of here
kris glances at the hair on his forearm
are they standing
running his hand over his arm saluting
come on mr
what come on
i cant do it
i want you to finish but i want you to live more
maurice sits back straight
he looks upset
we do the operation after i finish
i cant risk not finishing
i thought you understood what i was doing
why in gods name did you fly all the way here then
dont do this
to look me in the eye and say whats important to you isnt as important to me
to tell me you know whats best
to tell me life is more precious than what i feel for my wife
kris gets very emotional
he rises from this chair
parker you can yell at me if itll help
but im not risking your life
its mine to risk
maurice turns to the window away from kris
your operation is scheduled for friday
ill be back before then
kris walks to the door and stops
she knows you love her mr
she knows now
not looking at kris no more words
until i touch the ocean with my hands
its all just words
kris is tortured
he leaves the room
maurice wheels himself into the hall from the waiting area
he looks around
his eyes lock on the exit sign over the door at the end of the hall
his eyes scan the area quickly
he immediately finds the guard on the floor staring at him
the guard nods ever so slightly as if to say i know what youre thinking
maurice turns his attention to a small boy in a hospital gown being scolded by a head nurse
you cooperate with us about taking your medicine and maybe well talk about candy
the head nurse takes a chocolate bar out of the boys tiny hands
the boy offers no response
maurice watches curiously as stephanie walks over and pats the boys head
maurice catches a small exchange stephanie slips another candy bar into his pocket
the boy breaks into a warm smile
stephanie puts her fingers against her lips and winks
maurice takes this exchange in with great interest
stephanie steps into the room and prepares a tray of food
the silhouetted figure of maurice seated near the bay window turns to face her
you should be in bed
the face stares back from the shadows
she feels him watching
what do your friends call you
do you have a car steph
you should be in bed
stephanie moves to maurice
she stops short when his face comes into view
his eyes are raw red
his face puffy
youre in pain
i need your help
they told me you might try to talk me into something
you need to rest mr
its for your own good
beat ive been following your story for a long while
its a beautiful thing you did
you ever lose somebody stephanie
parker im supposed to give you your fish sticks
maurice melts her with his expression
did you tell him everything you wanted to
did you do everything you could while he was here
she shakes her head no the tears welling up in her eyes
if i dont do this steph my life isnt worth saving
maurice reaches out and squeezes her soft trembling hand
please help me
stephanie throws a nervous smile to the guard as she escorts a doctor down the hall
the doctors oversized while lab coat almost drags on the floor as he tries to hide the pain of being on his feet
maurice parker studies a bogus chart in his hands
his new glasses sliding off his nose
beads of sweat revealing his agony
three people in the elevator stephanie dr
maurice parker and a female physician
the female doctor looks at maurice curiously studying his demeanor she cant place him
the elevator doors open on the third floor
the sound of a tv floods the elevator compartment
maurice looks up in horror to see a close up of his face superimposed on the tv screen seated on the receptionists desk
a man gets on the elevator
the female doctor stares at the tv as the doors close she immediately turns to maurice
her view is blocked by the new passenger
the elevator progresses down
the female doctor leans forward trying to get a glimpse of maurice
the bell dings as the doors open on the ground floor
doctor maurice parker and stephanie quickly exit
the female doctor stays in the elevator and watches carefully
yells excuse me doctor
down the hall
maurice pauses and turns around fear etched across his face
the female doctor looks around the barren hall then turns back to maurice
the female doctor smiles as the doors shut
after a few moments of shock maurice smiles back
stephanie yanks maurice down the hall and out the emergency a colorful canopy of leaves
a familiar torn american flag
stephanies white vw rabbit pulls to a stop
this is it
this is where i fell
he turns back to stephanie who stares back at him emotionally
i never thanked my father
he did so much for me
i never thanked him
maurice holds her sad face in his scared hands
whispering its not too late
maurice gets out of the car painfully slow
he pulls his shoulder back upright with a laborious breath
a sense of pride returns to his face
he turns back to stephanie and catches a horrified look
he follows her stare
she is staring at his shirt
he looks down to see a dark crimson stain growing beneath the surface
he covers the area with his hand
youre going to have a lot of work to do when i get back
someone should be with you
he gives her his best smile and begins shuffling his feet over the loose gravel of the road
one step at a time
a black man grey balding hair walks hurriedly up the stairs
this is stan newton
keeping in step with newton is a police officer
sergeant emory jet white hair army cut gives him an intimidating appearance
newton stops emory before entering
im afraid mrs
matlin is very upset
emory lets the warning sink in before opening the door
adelles voice is booming
adelle yells at dr
ray a few nurses and the guard who was on duty
american journal of psychology psychological review and science so i think its safe to say my opinion is valid
she catches her breath
how does a grown man who can barely walk just stroll out
this is not james bond here this is my uncle who owns a bookstore and gets outwitted by grade school kids pulling pranks
adelle notices the new people in the room
matlin this is sergeant emory
hell help us find your uncle
adelle walks up to emory
let me tell you a story sergeant
there was a patient of mine who had a golden retriever mac
she loved mac not like a pet but like a family member
one day she had to leave mac with friends and wouldnt you know it mac gets away and ends up falling into a sewer
my patient comes back goes nuts when she hears that mac has been in the sewer for over hours
apparently the cop who found the dog didnt want to get his pants dirty
and neither did anyone else
so of course my patient decides to go in after it
breaks her hip and lands next to her dead dog who died of toxic fumes down there
adelle looks around at all the engrossed faces
the moral of the story is
she sued for a lot of money
she sued the friends the city and the officer for negligence on duty
she has no mac no happiness but shes very rich now
that was a dog
were talking about a human being
beat i hope everyone clearly understands the chain of events that will occur if something should happen to my uncle whom i love more than you can possibly imagine
now sergeant i would like to know right now if youre willing to get your pants dirty for my uncle
adelle and emory have a staring contest
adelle stands alone in a room with four men and she is clearly the one in charge
the door flies open
a police officer walks in pushing kris reddy through the door
i found him sneaking up the back stairs with this
the officer holds out a long coat and hat
emory walks up to kris
did you help mr
parker leave this hospital
kris looks to the empty bed and smiles
a big smile
but i was going to
emory turns to the officer and ushers him to the door
its time to get our pants dirty
i want three black and whites from here to handley avenue
and no communication with the station
the press monitors the transmissions
a born actor they can do that
that goes for all of you
not a word about this disappearance to anyone
absolutely no press
kris smiles innocently
police vehicles roam the city streets slowing to a crawl at every white male over forty walking the sidewalks
scanning the crowded intersections through the open window of her moving taxi
patrolling the streets on foot
he stops at a hot dog vendor and flashes a picture of maurice from his wallet
the vendor shakes his head no
a commotion breaks out one block down
kris spins in that direction
sees a crowd forming at the corner of the sidewalk
starts toward them
kris sees something through the thinner parts of the crowd
something laying on the sidewalk
kris walk turns into a sprint
kris works his way through the growing crowd puncturing the center of the circle
kris gazes down at the man writhing on the concrete
a black man shaking uncontrollably
a women standing over the fallen man waves the crowd back
he has epilepsy just give him room
an ambulance is on the way
the crowd spreads out
kris looks down at the unconscious man on the sidewalk sadly kris thoughts race
he moves on with newfound concern
a converted gymnasium
the room is splintered into rows of folding tables and chairs
against the wall is the serving stand
groups of volunteers dispense sandwiches and soup
the room is crowded with homeless men and women and a few children
in the back we find maurice
in his old clothes and tired disheveled appearance maurice is virtually invisible in this crowd
he presses something to his injured side
his condition has worsened
he eyes the entrance where a police officer walks in and moves to the serving counter
the officer asks the serving lady something and shows her a picture
she shrugs her shoulders and continues serving
the cop takes one last look around the hundreds of hungry people leaving the room
maurice pulls up his hand from underneath his shirt
the napkin he was holding at his side is saturated with blood
maurice replaces it with a clean napkin
emory rubs his eyes as the papers pile up on his desk
officer klein lays out the newspapers one after the other
times hes back
san francisco chronicle have you seen maurice
new york post unstoppable
klein lays the last paper on the table
is that all
the mayor sent word that he wants this thing handled quickly before anything unfortunate happens
he said he doesnt want to be known as the mayor of the city where maurice parker died
is that all
matlins waiting for you
klein opens the door
adelle walks in and stands at a distance from emory
she looks beat
her eyes are bloodshot and tired
what happened with the museum sighting
adelle is visibly dejected
its been a long couple of days for all of us
so let me be honest
if he hasnt turned up yet hes probably no
i spoke with dr
ray this morning and he said it was highly unlikely that someone in his condition could survive this long without medical attention let alone walk sixty miles in fact his
exact word was impossible
adelle fiddles with her coat
if i knew where he was id get him off the street but i think its time that you the mayor and everyone else be braced for the inevitable
the freeway is packed bumper to bumper
cars standing still in the hot sun
a hispanic man in his late forties juan is seated in his dodge caravan when he sees someone in his rearview mirror
a man is using a stick as a cane
the struggling man makes his way along the shoulder very slowly
juan reaches over to his passenger seat and turns over the l
under the heading hes back
is maurices picture
juan quickly rolls down his window as maurice passes by on the shoulder
yelling hey maurice man keep going buddy
maurice is startled at the mans yell but then smiles when the words register
maurice struggles forward
juan keeps yelling encouragements
this grabs the attention of other drivers who realize who is walking past them
one by one car doors open and people call to maurice
dont stop maurice
cars start to honk
more and more people turn to see the commotion
the yelling and honking is joined by whistles maurice cant believe it he tries to smile but cant hold it
his face tightens with every step
his shirt is soiled with blood
he raises his hand and gives a weak wave to a woman who holds up her little boy through the sunroof of the car
parked in the traffic
a newsreporter stares through binoculars
thank you god
the crew quickly prepares their cameras and equipment
they move like lightning
in seconds they are shooting the crowd and their hero
the air is charged
the noise growing more and more people join in
people stand on top of their cars to get a better view
stuck in traffic
officer dawson looks around as the parade of noise surges towards him
he looks out his window and catches a glimpse of maurice limping up the freeway
officer klein busts into emorys office just as adelle is about to leave
they found him
adelle is instantly charged with life
dawsons on the c
wants to talk with you sarg
adelle and as many officers that will fit in the room are listening to the radio conversation
whats going on

emory clicks to listen
the speakers explode with honking hes just getting off
its amazing sarg
everybodys out of their cars and cheering him on
shit get him in your car and take him to st
you ever see that concert footage of the doors sarg
adelle and the room of officers look confused
what the hell are you talking about
the doors the musical group
i saw a documentary where the police stopped one of their concerts snatched jim morrison right off the stage
the crowd went frickin nuts they tore up the place it turned into a war
beat im not stopping this concert by myself
and theres no way youre getting backup here its jammed up for miles
emory is thinking fast
why dont we just let him finish sarg
emory looks at adelles expectant face
he talks into the c
without taking his eyes off her
how does he look
hes bleeding heavily
hes having breathing problems and hes as pale as stone
if he wasnt moving id swear he was dead
he talks to the other officers in the room
bring him in
if he dies out there who the hell knows what that crowd will do
to himself let alone the mayor
the room empties fast
emory talks to adelle
hell be in a hospital within a half an hour
somehow adelles face doesnt convey much confidence
the shops are empty
the food court abandoned
close to five hundred people are huddled at the center of the mall
the hi fi house has four large screen tvs in their bay windows and speakers on the outside of the doors to lure passing shoppers in
all four sets have the same program on a newsbreak on maurice parker
the crowd listening anxiously
hes headed west on sharp park road
witnesses describe him as seriously injured
a shock of concern shoots through the crowd
lynn mccay and our highway cam has just spotted him
the picture cuts to a helicopter shot of downtown pacifica at first it just looks like an aerial of buildings then the camera zooms
it catches a tiny figure struggling through a street intersection
newspapers spiral through the air
maurice stretches his neck up squinting at the sun
the silhouette of a helicopter hovers above him
the noise is overpowering
maurices fatigue grows every muscle every ounce of energy goes into each step
maurice clutches the side of his head
the steps halted
hands trembling teeth clenched eyes squeezed shut
a surge of intense pain tries to buckle him
maurice fights it off as he moves his feet again
the helicopter swoops above as he makes his turn onto a final stretch of road adjacent to the beach
maurice stops dead in his tracks as he turns the corner to find a sea of people waiting for him
a momentous sight
people lined along the street for as far as the eye can see
air as they spot maurice standing at the end of the street
the crowd surges towards him
maurice is dazed
the noise the pain the faces swirl in his head as thousands of people surround him
maurice is overwhelmed
he is about to collapse when someone takes hold of his arm
maurice turns to see kris reddy standing next to him
in the midst of this chaos and growing madness
maurice and kris have an entire conversation with one emotional look
the sounds of sirens break the moment
kris turns to see two police cars turn on the street behind them
kris turns to maurice
dont stop walking
kris lets go of his arm and moves like lightning
he jumps atop a fire hydrant and yells to the crowd
the police are here
theyre coming to take mr
he needs our help
kris points to the squad cars inching their way up the street
dont let them end the walk
as they come to a halt as a wall of people stand in their way
the speaker on the police car blares through the air
step aside now
you are ordered to step aside now
the people dont move
a woman carrying a baby makes the baby move her little hand in a waving gesture to the officers behind the wheel of the police cars
the officers look at each other in disbelief
the far end of the beach road
a police car screeches to a stop
sergeant emory and adelle get out
adelle is completely blown away
she looks around at the pandemonium
thousands of men women and children celebrating with applause and cheers helicopters in the air camera crews standing on raised platforms
adelle drinks in the electric atmosphere with awe
emory yells orders into his walkie talkie as adelle breaks the outer edge of the crowd and disappears into the field of spectators
yelling what the hell is going on
its frickin wall to wall people and theyre way too emotional
we need mucho backup now
officers are to bring in mr
parker on sight dont ask questions dont hesitate bring him in
i want a barricade placed along the entire beach area
now god damn it now
emory clicks off and looks around at the growing crowd he turns to see a public bus unloading passengers fifty more spectators rush off the bus and rush toward the
maurice stares down at the ground
willing each new step
maurice looks up for a moment as something grabs his attention maurice gasps for air as his eyes focus
the small faces become clearer
maurice stands twenty feet from the entire population of pacifica high school
they cover one side of the street for an entire block
stretched over their heads held up by twenty students is a huge hand painted banner
maurice reads the words trucks unload dozens upon dozens of blue wooden barricades
an assembly line of officers place the barricades end to end at the place where the sand meets the pavement
emory yells orders as a new truck arrives
through ten states and over three thousand miles
a bookstore owner from philadelphia pennsylvania
the father that brought maurice in out of the cold in the midwest praying intensely in his chapel
an old hand held radio is on the pew next to him
he listens to the updates
ellen parker killed by a drunk driver september nd
isaacs father sitting in a tv station watching the monitors as the feeds come in from california
caldwell watches with great emotion eyes glued to the screen
a seven month odyssey through the heart of the country
the police officer from philadelphia who worked with adelle
he listens with the rest of the precinct to a portable stereo on a windowsill
the room is silent everyone hangs on the words coming from the speakers
the power of the human spirit
in a hotel room
the tv filling the room with news
gerald sits behind two large room service carts of food
he takes a big bite of a sandwich with an emotional smile to the television
a life threatening condition transient cerebral ischemia
where stephanie watches in the jam packed recreation room with about thirty patients watching a tv screen mounted high in the corner of the room
stephanie looks a mess shes been crying for a while
a journey he began by himself will end with a family of millions at his side
the boisterous crowd parts like a ripple effect as maurice walks through
the eyes fall emotionally on him as he stares down at the ground trying to keep moving
maurice gasps harder now his eyes stinging with drops of sweat falling from his brow
people in the crowd cover their mouths in shock as they get a clear view of him
his shirt soaked on one side with blood his entire body shaking with pain and exhaustion his face hollow and pale ghostly
maurice stops in his tracks
he looks up at a wooden sign worn from the years of salt water air
the sign reads maurices thoughts fade away from this place this time
we are in the parker bedroom
the lights are off
the moonlight from the windows blankets young maurice and young ellen as they lay in bed
ellen is cradled in maurices arms
she is awake and watching the shadows dance on the ceiling
she speaks in whispers
what do you think heaven is like
maurice opens his eyes and stares at his beautiful wife
i dont know
i think its a different place for each person
did you have a dream
i know where my heaven is
when i was ten my family lived in pacifica for a year
i used to go to the beach everyday that summer
i never felt so happy carefree
it was a magic place for me
thats where my heaven will be
if i die youll know where to look for me
go to sleep ellen
no really if god takes us away from each other you know where to look now
pacifying her the beach of pacifica california
go to sleep ellen
ellen smiles as she cradles deeper into maurices arms
husband and wife fall asleep together
maurice snaps back to the present the pain and commotion come back in a tidal wave of reality
maurice wipes the tears in his eyes and tries to take a step
someone blocks his way
uncle maurice please we have to get you to a hospital
adelle looks at her wounded uncle sadly
she touches his shirt and her hand comes away with blood
i have to finish first
i wont let you die
the inner circle of people bursts open as kris breaks let him finish adelle
hes almost there
yelling hes almost dead
cant you see that
this has nothing to do with you
maurice touches adelles cheek turning her attention back to him
he barely manages to get the words out
it has nothing to do with you either
this is between ellen and me
maurice begins crying uncontrollably
im begging you
maurice takes her hand and bends down putting his forehead to her hand as if getting blessings from her
let me do this for ellen let me do this for my wife
adelles heart is breaking
she weeps openly as she straightens her uncle to an upright position
she wipes the tears from his eyes with her hand gently
they reach for maurice
touch him and theyll be a riot
adelle stands firm the strength in her growing with each second
and ill start it
the officers are taken off guard
they look around at the countless sea of eyes on them
adelle sees they wont do anything and moves to maurices side
maurice begins to walk again
adelle to one side kris to the other and thousands of people following in step
the wave of people led by maurice walk toward the beach
the beach is blocked off by barricades all along its perimeter
police officers stand every ten feet along its edge
a young officer watches fearfully as the ocean of people move towards him
officer gantz talks into his walkie talkie
what should i do
at the other end of the beach barricade holding back hundreds of people trying to get to the beach
emory holds his walkie talkie and looks around at the sea of anxious faces
he makes eye contact with a woman in tears
clicking off his walkie talkie as the crowd presses up to the barricade
officer gantz is in awe as maurice appears from the crowd looking like a ghost of war
a holy apparition
maurice works his way painfully to gantz
gantz looks into maurices pleading eyes
maurice tries to say something but nothing can come out
gantz turns away from maurice and picks up one of the barricades
he makes an opening about three feet wide
gantz turns back to maurice stands at attention and steps aside
with unspeakable admiration watch your step mr
adelle and kris watch in amazement as maurice takes his first an empty beach
all sound and chaos disappears
the gentle the last fifty yards
the steps in the sand heavy torturous
each step a step closer to her
maurice picks up the pace
his numb feet making prints in the sand
his lungs on fire
twenty feet left
the cool water engulfs his feet and ankles
maurice falls to his knees like a man falling before god
kneeling in the water maurice raises his hands to his eyes
the water spills between his fingers
clear pure magical
maurice gasps hard as he falls onto his back
the water comes in and washes over him
hes staring into the sky
another wave of ocean gently blankets him
he spots something above him fluttering
his vision blurs
the image clears
maurice smiles as he makes out the image of a maurice takes a short breath very short
his body goes still his eyes stay fixes at one point
no more pain no more loss no more words
the water washes over maurice a
over his lifeless body
and over his smile
