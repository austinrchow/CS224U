written by justin haythe city lights
the soaring bridges and glowing windows of new york city
the sounds of a cocktail party
a party of bohemian types in the village
artists canvases propped up against the walls
a narrow hallway with couples talking intimately
two rooms crammed with young people smoking and drinking
a man and a woman in their s stand alone in a corner
frank wheeler intelligent good looks and april johnson a patrician beauty a woman amongst girls
hes been making her laugh
so what do you do
im studying to be an actress
im a longshoreman
smiles no i mean really
i mean really too
starting monday though im doing something a little more glamorous
night cashier at a cafeteria
smiles i dont mean how you make money
i mean what are you interested in
honey if i had the answer to that one i bet id bore us both to death in half an hour
he smiles revelling in her attention
later frank and april dance
they move well in sync looking into each others eyes
he slides his hand down the silk of aprils dress until it rests in the small of her back
close on their hands
their fingers slowly entwine as they lose themselves in each other
close on franks face seven years later full of doubt and tension as he watches his wife april on stage and as we hear the hollow voices of a very
bad amateur play
finally mercifully the curtain falls
then vigorous relieved applause
frank hears a voice from behind through the applause thank god thats over
april takes the final bow
shes fighting not to cry
frank applauds her loudly
looks around to see who else is joining him
but there is no noticeable crescendo in the applause
then frank hears the voice again and she was very disappointing
he cant argue
frank now moves against the crowd of exiting audience members towards the stage
he keeps his head lowered avoiding eye contact until he feels a hand on his sleeve
givings an older couple are standing in his way
very nice frank
frank steps around her
i cant tell you how much we enjoyed it
you have a very talented wife
frank forces a smile as he goes
ill pass it along
april sits alone at her dressing table crying
the cast mills backstage
the mood is subdued but some have decided to make light of the disaster
frank moves through the crowd
across the room he sees milly campbell s determinedly bright up on her tip toes
her husband shep s heavy set is still in costume shell shocked and pebbled with sweat
shes through there
points you bout ready for that drink
couple of minutes
the chair in front of the mirror is empty
a cigarette burns in the ashtray
frank glances at a standing screen in the corner
aprils costume is draped over the top
he goes towards it deciding what to say
heartfelt april sweetheart
you were great
i mean it
the door to the bathroom opens
april enters in street clothes
franks been talking to an empty room
you about ready to leave
ive just got to get this makeup off then we can go
she sits in front of the mirror too embarrassed to look at him
frank can see that her face is blotchy from crying
he puts his hand on her shoulder
i guess it wasnt a triumph or anything was it
april looks at him in the mirror
she holds his look just a second
and from her expression he knows he said exactly the wrong thing
i guess not
ill be ready in a minute
take your time
he removes his hands and lights a cigarette
april begins to take off her makeup
will you do me a favor
milly and shep wanted us to go out with them afterwards
will you say we cant
say its because of the baby sitter or something
well the thing is i already said that we could
i mean i just saw them out there and i said we would
then would you mind going out again and saying you were mistaken
that should be simple enough
dont you think thats a little bit rude april
well ill tell them myself
take it easy
ill tell them
he backs to the door
april and frank walk down a long empty echoing corridor past school lockers booster club posters and silent classrooms
they dont touch
they dont speak
the tension between them is palpable
april stares ahead
their faces are lit by the dashboard
after a while
i mean it baby
you were the only person in that play
he looks over at her
we just never shouldve let you get mixed up in the damned thing
youve studied for christs sake
could we sort of stop talking about it now
i just dont want you feeling bad about it thats all
because its not worth it
i mean its bad enough having to live out here among these damn people whatd you say
i said yes
all right frank
could you just stop talking now before you drive me crazy please
frank clenches his jaw and flips on the indicator
what are you doing
why are we stopping
the car comes to a stop at the side of the road
frank turns off the ignition
he slides towards her
no frank please dont
he puts his arms around her
baby its okay
please dont touch me
why cant you
leave me frank slides back behind the wheel
it strikes me that theres a considerable amount of bullshit going on here
and theres one or two things id like to clear up
number one its not my fault the play was lousy
number two its sure as hell not my fault you didnt turn out to be an actress and the sooner you get over that little piece of soap opera the
better off well both be
number three i dont happen to fit the role of dumb insensitive suburban husband youve been trying to hang that one on me ever since we moved here
number four she opens the door and is out of the car flashing across the headlights
frank struggles with his door
april stands in the dark yards from the road looking over an expansive countryside
theres only a few lights in the distance
this is still farmland
frank comes up behind her careful to keep his distance
what the hell are you doing
come back to the car
just let me stand here a second
frank raises his arms in exasperation
a car approaches
he puts a hand in his pocket and tries to look casual
the cars headlights light up aprils back then pass
she doesnt move
look cant we sit in the car and talk about it instead of running all over route twelve
havent i made it clear i dont particularly want to talk about it
jesus im trying to be nice about this thing
how kind of you
how terribly terribly kind of you
wait a minute
i dont deserve this
youre always so wonderfully definite arent you on the subject of what you do and dont deserve
she turns and walks past him back towards the car
wait a minute
he stumbles after her
other cars whizz by but hes past caring
wait a minute god damn it
she leans against the car and folds her arms
you listen to me
this is one time youre not going to get away with twisting everything i say
christ i wish youd stayed home tonight
you know what you are when youre like this
i really mean that
and you know what you are
eyes raking him youre disgusting
just because youve got me safely in this little trap you think you can bully me into feeling whatever you want
you in a trap
you in a trap
jesus dont make me laugh
clutching at her chest me
oh you poor pathetic little boy look at you
look at you and tell me how by any stretch of the imagination you can call yourself a man
he raises his fist she flinches away and bong
he punches the hood of the car
the look april gives him is probably the worst look hes ever received a look of pitying boredom
dont look at me like that april
could we please go home now
she calmly walks around and gets in the car
after a moment frank follows
they sit silently in the car in the darkness
a small attractive suburban house in the morning sunshine
frank walks out to the car stops and looks back at the house
april stands at the window
the sound of the car pulling away
frank stands on a grey platform amongst a crowd of commuters
the morning commuter train eases into the station
frank sits against the train window holding a new yorker
around him the train is crowded with men reading newspapers
in one swift movement all the doors of the commuter train swing open as a hundred feet step down onto the platform
an empty stairwell in grand central a tide of grim determined commuters rise into view
a mass of suits and hats
frank is amongst them
knox headquarters a squat formidable structure
thick honking traffic
frank walks with the crowd past a display window bright cardboard images of fashionable women grin and point their pencils at a list of product benefits speed accuracy pride of
place at the center of the display is a new knox electronic computer with a sign that reads performs a mans lifetime of work in just minutes
frank rides crushed against the wall in a crowded elevator
he glances over at maureen grube ripe a little obvious but undeniably sexy
she meets his look
and looks away
frank opens the bottom right drawer of his desk props up his feet and lights a cigarette
im going to need your help this morning old scout
seated beside frank jack ordway s tall and effete with greying hair appears to be hard at work hunched over a file
he is in fact propping up his head with his hand while shielding his eyes
for the next few hours youre to warn me of bandys every approach and you may have to screen me from public view in the likely event i that i
its that bad
good morning jack
nothing good about it i assure you
april drags two overflowing garbage cans to the curb
she stops and looks down the empty road
not a single human being in sight
close on aprils face
givings sits behind the wheel driving slowly along a suburban street talking at high speed
frank sits beside her wearing sunglasses
april sits in the back
we dont yet see what mrs
givings is describing only as it plays on their faces
of course i knew the moment you came off the train what you were looking for
a small remodeled barn or a carriage house and i just hate to be the one to tell you that sort of thing just isnt available anymore
but i dont want you to despair
there is one place down here i want to show you
now of course it isnt very desirable at this end
gestures as you see crawford road is mostly these little cinder blocky pick up trucky places plumbers carpenters little local people of that sort
frank turns around to april lowers his glasses
april stifles a giggle
she points her arm fully extended eventually it leads up to revolutionary road which is much nicer
now the place i want to show you is a sweet little house and a sweet little setting
simple clean lines good lawns marvelous for children
its right around this next curve
now youll see it there
they all look
see the little white one
sweet isnt it
the perky way it sits there on its little slope
charming isnt it
a smile full of promise
franks fist raps against the door of an office
ted bandy tight and precise looks up from behind a well organized desk
you wanted to see me
bandy holds out an envelope from behind his desk
came for you from toledo this morning
frank reaches for it but bandy moves it out of reach
this is the third one this month
oh right sorry
i thought id taken care of that
frank reaches again but bandy moves it
a little man enjoying his power
im not prepared to have this conversation again frank
these folks in the provinces look up to us frank
we need to be efficient
we cant have this kind of back and forth and so forth
its just not efficient
am i right
absolutely yes yes
bandy finally hands over the envelope
frank sits at his desk
what was that about
branch manager wants a revised brochure for the conference on the knox
impersonating bandy its just not efficient
sharp inhale sounds like a real goodie
i dont even know what the knox does
dont insult me
frank drops it in his in box
then looking up he sees maureen across the office
frank stands over maureen at her desk
the envelope from toledo lies in front of her
now if youll look in the inactive file under sp youll find copies of all the stuff we sent to the agency
and that way we can trace the thing back to its original sources
she nods jotting down a note
for the first time frank allows himself to take in her profile her cleavage her lips
i hope you werent planning on an early lunch
im not really hungry
ill check on you later
maureen and frank sit in a secluded corner
maureen sips a martini
shes already a little drunk
you know something
youre lucky you met me
i can show you the ropes
theres an art to survival at knox
let me show you what i mean
he waves over the waiter
bring me the telephone would you
and two more martinis
maureen looks daunted at her empty glass
the waiter brings over the phone
he holds his finger to his lips
he uses an authoritative tone
frank wheeler here
just wanted to let you know that ive had to send maureen grube down to visual aides for me
ill probably need her the rest of the day
frank hangs up and smiles at maureen
i never even heard of visual aides
thats because it doesnt exist
now were moving behind april as she moves through the silent house
she carries a basket of dirty laundry on her hip
she pulls the bedding off the couch
the distant sound of children playing
she turns to see mrs
givings at the screen door
april manages a friendly smile
i cant stay a minute
my dont you look comfy
i just wanted to bring this sedum for that messy patch in the front yard
she puts it on the table
all it wants is just a tiny dollop of water for the first few days and youll find it absolutely thrives
well thank you
you want some coffee
only if youre having some
helen sits down
with the end of her finger she pushes a dirty dish out of her way
is there something i can do for you helen
yes i almost forgot
i do have a small favor id like to ask
quiver of anxiety its about my son john
hes been in the hospital
im sorry to hear that
well actually just for the present hes in pleasant brook
she knows what it means
im so sorry
he just got a little run down
things can just get the better of us sometimes
dont you think
then pretending to read the titles on a stack of books on the table
it really is a marvellous facility and the treatments seem to be doing him wonders
anyway they said getting out for an afternoon might do him some good
she pauses on sartres nausea looks at it vaguely
i think he finds my friends a little conventional frankly
i mean hes travelled
he has a phd in mathematics
i suppose you could say hes an intellectual
it would do him a world of good to meet a young couple like you
wed love to helen
so i thought perhaps if you had some time
wed love to
flushed with relief thank you dear
april smiles generously
i remember when you first came off the train
you werent like most of my clients
you were different somehow
well you looked simply ravishing and i just knew frank did something terribly brilliant in town
you just seemed
of course you still are
april takes this in
april watches from the picture window as mrs
givings walks down the drive towards her car
her face is reflected in the glass
something is taking shape in her mind
the dining room is now almost empty
waiters and busboys eat in the corner
frank cuts a solitary figure
he lights his last cigarette and crumples the pack
i guess you got me a little drunk
maureen slides into the booth
she stares at the table trying to focus
you know what today is
its my birthday
im thirty years old today
maureen raises her glass then sways drunkenly
what was the name of the department you made up again
what a joke
he sips his drink
want to hear a real joke
she looks up at him
my old man worked at knox
he was a salesman in yonkers
once a year he used to take me into the city for lunch
it was supposed to be a special life advice sort of occasion
i used to sit there and think i hope to christ i dont end up like you
frank grins as if its supposed to be very funny
and here i am a thirty year old knox man
can you beat that
i think i kind of lost you
your father worked for knox
im sorry but everythings kinda going out of focus
frank takes her arm to steady her
she meets his eye
how bout some air
close on a hand opening an old cigar box
april is sitting with the box at the kitchen table
it contains various sentimental knickknacks from her past including photos of the kids of her and frank in new york with friends and a photograph of frank in uniform beneath
the eifel tower on liberation day
she studies it
frank fixes coffee in the tiny kitchen
april is sitting up in bed in the first blue light of day wearing franks t shirt
she holds a curled collection of black and white photographs in her lap
she stops on the same picture of frank and the eifel tower
frank comes over with the coffee and two cigarettes
he lights them both and gives her one
you ever been to paris
ive never really been anywhere
maybe ill take you with me
he lies down with his cigarette between his teeth
im going back first chance i get
people are alive there
he stares up at the ceiling
she studies him
all i know now is that i want to feel things
really feel them
hows that for an ambition
i think youre the most interesting person ive ever met
he looks at her overwhelmed by her face in the light
i mean it
frank stands at the mantle tying his tie
well i guess this wasnt what you had in mind when you went to work this morning
maureen covers herself with the sheets
it certainly wasnt
frank inspects the contents of the mantle photos of maureen at the prom maureen with her parents
maureen tentatively fingers her hair that has now gone to frizz
the sheet slips down
she grabs at it
then wills herself to calm down and act sophisticated
do you have a cigarette frank
he turns and smiles at her
he comes over and gives her one
lights it with his zippo
she exhales slowly gaining confidence
frank gets up and pulls on his jacket
can i get you a drink or anything
no thanks maureen
actually i guess id better be cutting out its getting kind of late
gee thats right
have you missed your train
its all right ill get the next one
he comes over to her
bends down kisses her gently on the lips
listen you were swell
take care now
franks station car turns into the driveway
he sits there a moment in the darkness
frank approaches the door with his key
he takes a moment to gather himself but before he can the door opens
april is dressed in a black cocktail dress
she looks wonderful
she steps forward and takes his face in her hands
she kisses him
why are you all dressed up
she hands him a glass of whiskey and closes his fingers around it
first of all i missed you all day and i want to say im sorry
im sorry for the way ive been since that stupid play
im sorry for everything and
and i love you
now wait here till i call you
she goes leaving frank in stunned silence
he takes a large drink
from inside the house the sound of the childrens voices
then aprils voice alright frank
you can come in now
frank enters the house
walks through the darkened living room towards the light
enters the dining room
the room is lit by the candles burning on a birthday cake
jennifer michael and april sit around the table wearing paper birthday crowns
they sing happy birthday
frank scrubs his skin his scalp his face trying to wash away maureen
he turns off the water
he stands there in the silence regaining control
frank steps out of the bathroom
april turns from the mirror wearing the silk negligee and comes towards him with two glasses
i have had the most wonderful idea
ive been thinking about it all day
whats all this about
you know how much money we have saved
she hands frank a glass of brandy
enough to live on for six months without you earning another dime
and with the money we could get from the house and the car longer than that
what we get for the house
what are you talking about
where are we going to live
you always said it was the only place youd ever been that was worth living
so why dont we go there
whats stopping us
whats stopping us
well i can think of a lot of things
for instance what kind of a job could i possibly get
you wont be getting any kind of job because i will
dont laugh listen a minute
have you any idea what they pay for secretarial positions in the government agencies in europe
embassies and those things
frank laughs again
no i dont
im serious about this frank
do you think im kidding or something
no i know i know
i just have a couple of questions is all
for one thing do you mind telling me what exactly im supposed to be doing while youre out earning all this money
she draws back shocked that he doesnt get it
dont you see thats the whole idea
youll be doing what you shouldve been allowed to do seven years ago
youll have time frank
youll have time to find out what it is that you actually want to do and when you figure it out youll have the time and the freedom to start
sweetheart its just not very realistic is all
well i happen to think this is unrealistic
i think its unrealistic for a man with a fine mind to go on working like a dog year after year at a job he cant stand coming home to
a place he cant stand to a wife whos equally unable to stand the same things
frank is silent
how could anyone possibly argue with her
you want to know the worst part
our whole existence here is based on this great premise that were somehow very special and superior to the whole thing and you know what ive realized
were just like everyone else
look at us
weve bought into the same ridiculous delusion
this idea that you have to resign from life and settle down the moment you have children
and weve been punishing each other for it
listen we decided to move out here
no one ever forced me to take the job at knox
i mean who ever said i was supposed to be a big deal anyway
when i first met you there was nothing in the world you couldnt do or be
i was a little wise guy with a big mouth thats all
you were not
how can you even say that
so ill have time
and god knows thats appealing
its very appealing
and i mean everything you say might make a certain amount of sense if i had some definite talent maybe
if i were an artist or a writer
but frank listen to me its what you are thats being stifled here
its what you are thats being denied and denied and denied in this kind of life
and whats that
dont you know
he looks at her
she gazes back at him
youre the most valuable and wonderful thing in the world
youre a man
frank looks at her
in that moment he loves her more than ever before
he kisses her
this is our chance frank
this is our one chance
why the hell not
april throws her arms around him
the elevator doors slide open
frank steps onto the fifteenth floor full of energy
frank arrives at his desk
casually tosses his briefcase down
lights a cigarette
jack stands nearby making idle chat with office co workers ed small and vince lathrop a pair of overgrown children
good to see your shining face
whats the news
im moving to paris
and im moving to tangiers
frank shrugs smiles picks up the toledo file scans it
he reaches for his dictaphone and clears his throat
intra company letter to toledo
chalmers branch manager
with regard to recent and repeated correspondence this is to advise that the matter has been
very satisfactorily taken in hand period paragraph
he takes out a cigarette
we wholly agree that the existing brochure is unsuitable
to this end we have developed
he lights the cigarette with a snap of his zippo
speaking of production control
hes making it up as he goes and enjoying it
its all meaningless now
april sits in the american express office
here you are mrs
wheeler a handsome clerk smilingly hands her a stack of documents
heres the travellers checks you asked for
and your steamer reservations
and these ill pass on to the embassy for you
she looks at them in her hands its real
jack frank ed and vince sit crammed in a booth in a tiny crowded midtown luncheonette
frank looks pleased with himself
the rest sit in stunned silence
and when does this noble experiment commence
october at the outside
jack and vince exchange a look
franks enjoying the effect
i just happen to think people are better off doing some kind of work they actually like
vague right yes
mumbled absolutely absolutely
i mean assuming there is a true vocation waiting for you
wouldnt you be just as likely to discover it here as there
a waitress puts the check on the table
i dont think its possible to discover anything on the fifteenth floor of the knox building and i dont think any of you do either
the men are silent
frank picks up the check
this ones on me
frank is standing leaning against a coffee bar in grand central station
he is finishing a beer
it is rush hour and amidst the sea of people he is the only one not moving
he is watching all the people walking by with an air of detached amusement
as if he were now above them all
frank rides between train cars
the wind whips his hair
he takes a deep pull from a pinched cigarette then flicks it straight as a bullet into the passing countryside
he feels alive
the commuter train slows into the station
a door swings open
and frank leaps from the still moving train onto the platform
he slows to a walk
the kids dance back and forth through the sprinkler shrieking with pleasure
april sits on the steps in front of the house reading some material from the american express office
she looks up as franks car pulls into the drive
he steps out of the car and comes towards her
she looks up and smiles
he drops his brief case on the ground and walks towards her
she meets him in the middle of the lawn and they embrace
close up two fingers walk the journey from new york to paris across the page of an atlas
michael and jennifer dressed for bed sit sandwiched between april and frank under the bedclothes
all the way to
a pause as the two kids stare at the atlas
its a big world out there and we thought maybe we should go see a little bit of it
how far is it
a long way
we have to take a boat ride over the sea to get there
i wont know anyone there
and neither will i
but remember when you started school
and now look how many friends you have
frank senses that they are a little concerned
april and frank look to one another
youll never guess what they eat in paris
youll never guess
and frogs legs
the children dissolve into disgusted laughter
april and frank laugh with them
at the bottom of the stairs shep hums a big band number as he vigorously shines his shoes
he takes a swig of beer and lets out a satisfied belch
milly sits at a vanity table doing her face
she wears a floral dress and her hairs been done
she looks at shep in the mirror
you better get changed theyll be here soon
that what youre wearing
panic dont you like it
you look great doll
guess i better haul ass
he walks into the bathroom
milly looks back at her reflection
the small explosion of a beer can opening
shep watches the golden liquid fill his glass
shep walks through the living room with his glass of beer
hes halfway across the room before he notices his four sons dressed in matching pajamas propped up on their elbows chewing gum at the television screen
they dont even look up
shep walks across the grass to the edge of his property
he drinks and looks down over revolutionary road
he can see the wheeler house
he takes a drink of beer his eyes focused on the house
shep wheels around
april and frank are standing there with milly
april wears a new indigo silk dress
her hair moves in the warm breeze
shes never looked better
shep mixes drinks with his back to the room
milly walks in and places two heaping trays of hors douvres on the coffee table
oh those look great
april helps herself
april i cant get over it you look like the cat who ate the canary
do you have something to tell us
a little bit of news
disapproving not to pry or anything
suddenly unsure im not prying
am i prying
i didnt mean to
actually we have got some pretty important news
shep and milly look up expectantly
he smiles conspiratorially at april
you want to tell em
april smiles back at him
were going to europe
millys face drops
shep is frozen
then but what for
because weve always wanted to
because the kids are still young
because its beautiful
shep you tell her
its a great city
milly glances nervously at shep
when did you make this decision
about a week ago
its hard to remember
we just suddenly decided to go thats all
about a week ago and you tell us now
we had to get used to the idea
shep forces himself across the room and hands the wheelers their drinks
so whats the deal frank
you get a job over there or what
what do you mean not exactly
frank wont be doing any kind of a job because i will
to frank and what are you going to do
im going to study
and im going to read and
i suppose im going to finally figure out what i want to do with my life
while she supports you
while she supports me
at least in the beginning
you wouldnt believe what they pay for secretarial work in government agencies over there
nato and e
and those places
the cost of living is dirt cheap compared to here so we should be all right
the truth is we just need something different
were not getting any younger and we dont want life to just pass us by
gee it sounds wonderful kids
i mean it it really sounds wonderful
well certainly miss you though wont we sweetie
milly sits on the edge of the bed in her night gown
she is brushing her hair
shep stands in the open doorway to the bathroom doing up his pyjamas
after a beat
you know what i think
milly looks up
i think this whole plan sounds a little immature
millys face brightens
oh god im so relieved
i was thinking that the whole time
what kind of man is going to sit around in his bathrobe picking his nose while his wife works all day
i dont know shep
i just dont know
milly is crying
what is it
im just so relieved
he sits down beside her
she falls into his arms
its all right
its going to be all right
a kids shout from somewhere in the house
milly sits up
frank and april burst into the kitchen laughing
jesus their faces
youd think wed told them that we were swimming up the yangtzee river or something
laughing april hands frank a drink
you know what this is like april
talking like this
the whole idea of taking off to europe this way
its like the way i felt going up to the line the first time in the war
i was probably just as scared as everyone else but inside i never felt better
i felt alive
i felt full of blood
and everything looked more real
the guys in their uniforms
the snow on the fields the trees
and all of us just
i mean i was scared of course
but i kept thinking this is it
this is the truth
i felt that way once too
he looks at her
and theres something in her eyes
the first time you made love to me
he walks over to her and kisses her passionately
and they make love that way face to face with the lights on looking into each others eyes fully clothed until he comes inside her
as he comes she makes a sound almost inaudible but it sounds like
no he holds her breathing heavily
she strokes his head
frank walks across the th floor the atmosphere unusually abuzz
he arrives in his cubicle
jack ed and vance are talking in hushed tones
bart pollock is here
hes in bandys office
a small signal light illuminates on franks desk
looks like he wants to talk to you
frank looks around
theyre all looking at him
he looks over in the direction of bandys office
keep my name out of it
bandy looks up from his desk
an uncharacteristic smile
how are you
you know bart pollock
well weve never met but a massive man in tan gaberdine rises up from a chair
glad to know you frank
he holds a file in his enormous hand
speaking of production control
frank looks away ready for a dressing down
this is a crackerjack
theyre just tickled to death in toledo
he slaps the file on the desk
frank cant believe it
close of a book brighter french
frank sits on the couch flipping absently
you wouldnt have believed this guy
april enters carrying a plate of sandwiches
hes perfect presidential material in the worst sense
a million dollar smile and about three pounds of muscle between his ears
mimicking pollocks booming voice frank this is a crackerjack
april looks around to be sure everythings in place
wish i saw his face when you told him you were leaving
frank looks away
toot of a car horn
april goes to the window
i think this is them
through the picture window we see the givings car is parked in the driveway
givings gets out of the car holding a tinfoil covered baking pan
givings opens the backseat
out steps john s an institutional haircut and ill fitting suit
he looks around the sunny neighborhood
the kitchen is suddenly crowded with the givings frank and april
overlapping sorry to be late
youre not late
the traffic was terrible
good to see you
wasnt it terrible howard
hands are shook the baking dish exchanged
you didnt have to do that
the time they finish that stretch of road theyll have to start all over again
john stands by himself closest to the door
and you must be john
silence settles over the room
say hello john
nice to meetcha
heard a lot aboutcha
john smiles exposing a mouthful of deeply stained yellow teeth and high eroded gums
givings leads the group into the living room
where are your darling children
theyre at a birthday party
sorry they couldnt be here
john walks around the room stiff legged examining the book shelves the paintings
if i had a certified lunatic coming around the house id probably get the kids out of the way too
april and frank exchange a quick glance
oh look at all this food
you didnt have to go to any trouble for us
its just some sandwiches
april lifts the plate and offers it to john
john would you like a sandwich
he avoids her look but he takes four
helens been talking it up about you people for months
the nice young wheelers on revolutionary road the nice young revolutionaries on wheeler road
whod like some sherry
please dont bother frank
id like some sherry
and ill drink helens if she doesnt beat me to it
april cant suppress a smile
suddenly serious but hey
you got a high ball glass
put a couple three ice cubes in it pour it up to the brim
thats the way i like it
i think i can do that
givings eats his sandwich watching his son
oh this is the most wonderful egg salad april
you must tell me how you fix it
frank hands john his high ball glass
you a lawyer frank
no im not
i could use a lawyer
john lets not get started again about the lawyer
pop couldnt you just sit there and eat your wonderful egg salad and quit horning in
givings gives his son a level warning look
see ive got a good many questions to ask and im willing to pay for the answers
now i dont need to be told that a man who goes after his mother with a coffee table is putting himself in a weak position legally thats obvious
frank and april exchange a look
john come and have a look out this fabulous picture window
givings gets up and goes to the window
if he hits her with it and kills her thats a criminal case
oh look the suns coming out
if all he does is break the coffee table and give her a certain amount of aggravation and she decides to go to court over it thats a civil case
maybe well see a rainbow
john come have a look
ma how about doing everybody a favor
how about shutting up
shes not smiling now
steady down now
with her back to the room mrs
givings closes her eyes
i can look into it
maybe recommend someone
john stares at frank for any sign of condescension
so what do you do frank
i work for knox business machines
you design the machines
make em sell em repair em
all these questions
i sort of help sell them i guess
i work in the office
actually its sort of a stupid job
i mean theres nothing you know interesting about it or anything
whaddya do it for then
maybe frank doesnt want to be questioned like this son
okay okay okay i know its none of my business
and besides i know the answer
you want to play house you got to have a job
you want to play very nice house very sweet house then you got to have a job you dont like
anyone comes along and asks whaddya do it for
hes probably on a four hour pass from the state funny farm
john smiles his yellow grin
i agree with everything you said john
we both do
thats why im quitting the job in the fall and were taking off
were moving to paris
john looks over at his mother
did you know about this ma
how do you feel about that ma
the nice young wheelers are taking off
john bursts into a painful braying laugh
it goes on and on
givings brings a hand to her brow shes on the verge of tears
steady down son
april looks at frank the whole thing is in danger of going off the rails
how about some fresh air john
john stops laughing abruptly
he looks to his parents
if thats all right with you
i dont know if its a good idea
if john wants to i dont see the harm
frank april and john walk through the woods
the ground is freshly rained on and damp
the sun is bright
john buttons up his top button and pulls his sleeves down over his hands
i hear youre a mathematician
you hear wrong
its all gone now
you know what electrical shock treatments are
yes i do
ive had thirty seven
he pushes his hat back and turns his head at april
there are scars on his forehead
april can see them
supposed to jolt out the emotional problems
just jolted out the mathematics
mimicking how awful
why because mathematics is so interesting
because the shocks must be awful and
well because its awful not to be able to do what it is you want to do
i think mathematics are dull
john stares at april
i like your girl frank
so what do a couple of people like you have to run away from
were not running
john comes to a stop
and whats in paris
a different way of life
so maybe we are running
were running from the hopeless emptiness of the whole life here
the hopeless emptiness
now youve said it
plenty of people are on to the emptiness but it takes real guts to see the hopelessness
john continues walking
frank and april watch him go
frank and april at the kitchen table
you know hes the first person who seemed to know what we were talking about
maybe we are just as crazy as he is
if being crazy means living life as if it matters then i dont care if we are completely insane
beat do you
i love you so much
the small attractive house bathed in sunlight
frank follows bart pollock as he cuts a swathe through an impressive midtown eatery
a small maitre d scuttles in front of them
bart nods points at well wishers and makes a politicians show of knowing the staff
tell you something frank
im a little sore at bandy for the way hes kept you under a bushel all these years
this place okay for you
frank smirks at the performance
this is just fine sir
bart pollock sits across an expanse of white tablecloth gripping a martini glass in one of his enormous paws
one thing interests me frank and one thing only selling the electronic computer to the american businessman
thats why im assembling a team
men like you not your average salesmen
itll mean more money and i got to be honest maybe more of a time commitment
but youll be part of something exciting wheeler
well sir it sounds exciting
frank looks down at his plate
he cant help himself
do you happen to remember an earl wheeler
bart looks at him blankly
out of yonkers
cant say that i do
relation of yours
he worked at knox almost twenty years
thinking earl wheeler
no reason you would have heard of him
well im sure he was a good man
theres something i should have mentioned earlier
im leaving the firm
in the fall
no its not another outfit
bart holds up his hands
now look frank
is it a question of money
because if it is theres no reason we cant get together on a satisfactory i appreciate that but its not money
its more of a personal thing
a personal thing
looks down clearly disapproving frank
let me tell you something my father told me
a man only gets a couple chances in life
if he doesnt grab em by the balls it wont be long before he finds himself sitting around wondering how he got to be second rate
i guess so
bart lets it hang
so do me a favor
sleep on it
discuss it with your wife
because lets face it where the hell would any of us be without our wives anyway
on franks face
and frank in all sincerity if you do decide to join us i believe itll be a thing youll never regret
and i believe something else too
i believe itd be a fine memorial to your dad
frank finds himself surprised by his welling up of emotion
frank is sitting in his cubicle over his dictaphone
jack is long gone
knowing what youve got comma knowing what you need comma knowing what you can do without dash
thats inventory control
he stubs out a cigarette in an overflowing ashtray
close on his face
maureen stops by franks cubicle
she pretends to be surprised to see him
oh hi frank
i got to dig myself out here
i heard you were getting promoted
frank shrugs no big deal
i guess your dad would have been real proud huh
surprised she remembered huh
yeah i guess so
smiles sweetly so
maybe i should buy you a drink or something
we dont know which way hell go
she cant quite believe it
ill just get my coat
frank sits there a moment longer thinking
then he follows
on a television
elmer fudd points a gun at bugs bunny and pulls the trigger
frank frowns into his french phrase book
mike is watching the tv
april works a sewing machine with a cigarette burning beside her
jennifer stands beside her holding a stuffed giraffe and a list which she reads
im going to take my doll carriage and my bear and my three easter rabbits and my giraffe and all my dolls and my doll house
i thought maybe wed give the doll house to madeline
i dont want to give it to madeline
april has to stop to re thread and shes losing patience
i already explained to you the big things are going to be hard to pack
frank lowers the book
he recognizes her tone
but madeline can have my bear and my easter rabbits no
just the big things
wouldnt you rather go outside and play with michael
i dont feel like it
youve been inside all day
i dont feel like it
well i dont feel like explaining everything fifteen times to somebody whos too bored and silly to listen
jennifer turns and runs up the stairs upset
april lets out a defeated sigh
she turns to the kitchen to see to the supper
steam rises from the vegetables
frank stands in the entrance silently watching for a moment
whats the matter
she carries a pot of steaming overcooked vegetables to the sink slops them into a colander
i dont believe you
did something happen today or what
nothing happened today that i havent known about for days and days
oh god frank please dont look so dense
do you mean you havent guessed or anything
what are you talking about
she finally stops and looks at him
im pregnant thats all
beat as he absorbs it
hes totally blind sided
she comes over to him
oh frank i meant to wait until dinner to tell you but i just well ive been pretty sure all week and today i went to the doctor and now
i cant even pretend its not true
still stunned jesus
you didnt say anything
oh i dont know what i thought
he stares still unsure how he feels
im sorry frank
im so sorry
i know you are
she looks at him with slight desperation
we dont have to let this stop us
there are things we can do
remember that girl at school i told you about
as long as you do it before weeks its fine
he just looks at her and his silence makes her desperate
weve got to be together in this frank
otherwise nothings going to make any sense
well figure it out
he takes her in his arms
so we have time
on franks face
slowly he smiles
i love you frank
i love you too
a baking hot day
the sky is electric blue
radios play children cry dogs bark
sunbathers cover almost every inch of sand
we find shep milly frank and april with beach chairs coolers and umbrellas
a child wrapped in a towel sleeps on millys lap
april wears a pair of dark glasses behind which she is thinking thinking
so frank hows work
they gonna survive without you
something kinda funny happened the other day
i did some dumb little piece of work to get myself off the hook with bandy and suddenly im the bright young man
laughs thats always the way isnt it
i knocked this thing off in a couple of minutes and now they want me to join their team of specialist salesmen
itd be funny if they werent talking about so much damn money
april turns and looks at frank
long and hard
if he can feel her look he doesnt show it
stealing a glance at april so you tempted
shrugs well its kind of ironic dont you think
april suddenly stands up
frank and shep watch her walk down to the waters edge
frank stares after her
april stands in the water staring out over the sea
the waves break against her ankles
whether it occurs to her or not shes staring in the direction of europe
frank comes up beside her
i thought you turned the job down
shrugs not yet
its just an option thats all
with the money theyre talking things could be different for us here
we could get a better place
april shakes her head and drags on her cigarette
look the point is we could be happy here
at least for a while
she stares out at the sea
it is possible that parisians arent the only ones who know how to lead interesting lives april
she turns to him
so youve made up your mind
like i said its an option
and supposing youre right
you make all this money and we have this interesting life here
wont you still be wasting your life toiling away at a job you find ridiculous
just like your father
sharp maybe we let that be my business
incredulous your business
exhales its too hot for this
im going to get wet
she just looks at him
he walks into the ocean
she stands on the shore watching him swim away from her
april paces the family room
her hair is a defiant mess
she still wears her bathing suit under her clothes
frank sits on the couch
the windows are open and most of the lights are off
its a very hot night
you dont want to go do you
come on april
of course i do
because youve never tried at anything
and if you dont try at anything you cant fail
what the hell do you mean i dont try
i support you dont i
i pay for this house
i work ten hours a day at a job i cant stand
you dont have to
im not happy about it
but i have the backbone not to run away from my responsibilities
it takes backbone to lead the life you want frank
he shakes his head and gets up
where are you going
is it alright with you if i go to the bathroom
she disgustedly twists out her cigarette and immediately lights another
frank splashes water on his face like a boxer between rounds
he looks up at his reflection
he reaches for a towel but there isnt one
he turns to the shelf behind him and pulls down a fresh towel
something catches his eye
he reaches to the back and retrieves a small brown paper package
he opens it his face slowly registering what it means
april wheels around as frank storms in a rubber syringe in his hand
what the hell are you going to do with this
and what do you think youre going to do
youre going to stop me
youre damn right
go ahead and try
he comes at her across the room with the syringe in his hand
she moves away
listen to me
you do this you do this and i swear to god ill youll what
youll leave me
is that a threat or a promise
he shakes it in her face
when did you buy this april
i want to know
you know you really are being melodramatic about the whole thing
as long as its done in the first twelve weeks its perfectly safe
thats now april
dont i get a say
of course you do
it would be for you frank dont you see
so you can have time
like we talked about
how can it be for me if the thought makes my stomach turn over
then its for me
tell me we can have the baby in paris frank
but dont make me stay here
we cant have the baby in paris
i dont need everything we have here
i dont care where we live
i mean who made these rules anyway
the only reason we moved out here was because i got pregnant
then we had another child to prove the first one wasnt a mistake
i mean how long does it go on
he turns away
do you actually want another child
well do you
he wont answer
come on tell me
tell me the truth frank
we used to live by it
you know whats so good about the truth
everyone knows what it is however long theyve lived without it
no one forgets the truth frank they just get better at lying
so tell me do you really want another child
frank turns towards her
all i know is what i feel
and anyone else in their right mind would feel the same way
quiet but ive had two children
doesnt that count in my favor
the fact that you even put it that way
you make it sound like having children is a punishment
i love my children
and youre sure about that
what the hell is that supposed to mean
april you just said our daughter was mistake
how do i know you didnt try to get rid of her or michael for that matter
how do i know you didnt try to flush our entire fucking family down the toilet
no thats not true
of course i didnt
but how do i know april
please just stop frank
april a normal woman a normal sane mother doesnt buy herself a piece of rubber tubing to give herself an abortion so she can go live out some god damn
sober all im saying is you dont seem entirely rational about this thing
and maybe we should get someone to help you think about it
and the new jobs going to pay for that too
april if you need a shrink itll be paid for
april turns to the book shelves
her back to him
frank waits his heart beating quickly
i guess there isnt much more to say then is there
her eyes are bright with tears
so i guess paris was a pretty childish idea huh
everything hangs on franks answer
i guess maybe it was
april closes her eyes
tears run down her cheeks
he walks over to her but he doesnt touch her
we can be happy here april
i can make you happy here
she cries quietly
weve had a great few months
it doesnt have to end
she turns to face him
were going to be okay
i hope so frank
i really hope so
frank stands at the picture window watching
april approach the children
she squats on the ground so she can be at their height and talks to them
michael tries to get into her arms
jennifer turns away and walks sulkily across the grass
frank looks into his coffee cup
he doesnt look like a man who won an argument
frank sits smoking nervously in an oak paneled waiting room
the door opens behind him
he gets to his feet
thank you for waiting
pollock can see you now
he follows her through the door
the door closes behind her
we see the scene in dumb show through the glass door
bart looks up as frank enters
an i knew it all along smile spreads across pollocks face
he offers his hand to frank
frank smiles thinly
foiled by faulty contraception
frank ed vince and jack sit in the same booth in the same crowded luncheonette
frank stares out the window
the others cant contain themselves
i cant say im sorry
wouldnt have been the same without you
youd have been sorely missed in the old cubicle i can tell you that
he raises his glass drinks alone
frank looks away from the window
well the plan always seemed a touch unrealistic dont you think
frank glares with barely contained fury
i suppose its none of my business really
i suppose it isnt
well we wont be the only ones glad to hear the news
theyll be celebrating in the secretarial pool
ed and vince chuckle
two drumsticks spinning in a spotlight
they click out a rhythm and crash into a number
cut back to reveal a small low ceilinged joint
on stage are the steve kovack quartet four perspiring middle aged men with day jobs
youngish couples and the odd middle aged couple navigate the dance floor
a smattering of lost singles line the bar
the wheelers and campbells sit squashed into a booth on the side of the dance floor
several empty glasses have accumulated
milly is beating the edge of the table with red drink straws
shes a few drinks ahead
they have to shout over the music
remember the first time you brought us here
you said it takes a special kind of taste to enjoy vitos log cabin
its so awful its kinda nice
they laugh at the old joke
then milly begins to weep
dabs at her eyes look at me
im just so happy
our little gangs back together again
she knocks her drink back
the number finishes
at least europes not going anywhere
april stares out at the dance floor
frank looks at her
a new number starts
i dont really feel like it
milly takes him by the hand and pulls him away
shep and april watch
then shep turns his attention to april
tipsy guess aprils pretty blue bout paris huh
think shell be okay
give us girls a couple of days and we can get over anything
frank turns his attention to milly
hes a good dancer
his movements are fast and aggressive his mind on april
milly is a little too drunk and hurries to keep up perspiring through her dress
he spins her around and around back and forth into his arms
milly begins to look slightly dizzy
he doesnt hear her over the music or he doesnt care
sudden remorse you okay
im afraid im not very
her body spasms with the need to be sick
she turns and rushes for the ladys room
frank leads the way through the cars
shep supports milly who is now falling down drunk
april walks alone a few paces behind
they reach sheps car which is trapped behind several other cars
of all the inconsiderate
frank looks to april
look why dont you take milly home then go home yourself and that would take care of both sitters
then shep can take me home later
all right with me
to april youll be alright
frank holds aprils look an instant then walks away with car keys in hand
steve kovack performs an exhausting sweat drenched drum solo
april and shep now sit alone in the booth
im sorry youre not going away anymore
i know it was important to you
april distantly nods her thanks
dont take this wrong ive been there and
they dont have so much we dont have here
it didnt have to be paris
shep sips his beer trying to figure out how to connect with her
you just wanted out huh
i wanted in
i just wanted us to live again
shep nods not entirely sure what she means
for years i thought we shared a secret
that we would be wonderful in the world
i didnt exactly know how but just the possibility
kept me hoping
she takes a long slug of her drink
how pathetic is that
to put all your hopes in a promise that was never made
see frank knows
he knows what he wants
hes found his place
hes just fine
married two kids
it should be enough
it is for him
hes right we were never special or destined or anything at all
sure you are
youre the wheelers
youre a terrific couple everyone says so
april doesnt hear shes pursuing her thought
i saw a different life
i cant stop seeing it
beat cant leave cant stay
beat no damn use to anyone
april turns and stares at him
the band strikes up a new number
come on lets do it
april and shep dance
shep cant dance well but hes trying
april on the other hand is a wonderful dancer
she dances out as far as their joined hands allow and does a little twitching hip bobbing curtsies before twisting back all seemingly effortless
it is joyous released
shep slips behind the wheel and is immediately kissing her groping
let me take you somewhere
in the back seat
she climbs into the back seat
he pulls off his jacket and climbs in after her
he folds the jacket under her head for a pillow
she remains perfectly still allowing him to kiss her to search under her clothing to kiss her skin and finally to lift her skirt and pull her clothing aside and
make love to her against the vinyl seat cover
as suddenly as it began its over
shep collapses against her
april stares into the darkness
this is what ive always wanted
i love you
dont say that
i mean it i love you
please just be quiet for a minute then you can take me home
they begin to quietly assemble themselves
frank stands at the mirror putting on a clean shirt
april stands at the kitchen table chopping vegetables
she wears an unflattering floral dress
frank stands in the doorway watching
its beautiful out
yes its lovely
he glances at the calendar
you know what today is
she doesnt look at him
its twelve weeks
he walks over to her
he takes her in his arms
look this has been kind of a crazy summer
weve both been under a strain
i mean i know youre upset
you know im not sleeping with you and you want to know why
she looks him straight in the eye
well im sorry frank but i dont really feel like talking about it
she pulls herself free of his grasp
he watches as she adds the vegetables in the pot on the stove
what do you feel like talking about
would it be all right if we didnt talk about anything
cant we just take each day as it comes and do the best we can and not feel we have to talk about everything all the time
he smiles patiently
i dont think i suggested we talk about everything all the time
my point was weve both been under a strain and we ought to be trying to help each other as much as we can right now
shes utterly uninterested and its making him nervous
i mean god knows my own behavior has been pretty weird lately
i mean as it happens
there is actually something id like to tell you about
she continues folding the napkins
ive been with a girl in the city a few times
finally she stops moving
she looks at him
a girl i hardly even know
it was nothing to me but she got a little carried away
shes just a kid
anyway its over now
its really over
if i werent sure of that i guess i could never have told you about it
why did you
relieved baby i dont know
i think it was a simple case of wanting to be a man again after all that abortion business
some kind of neurotic irrational need to prove something
i dont mean why did you have the girl i mean why did you tell me about it
he is suddenly unsure
i mean whats the point
is it supposed to make me jealous or something
is it supposed to make me fall in love with you or back into bed with you or what
i mean what am i supposed to say
he tries that same patient smile but its not convincing
why dont you say what you feel
i dont feel anything
in other words you dont care what i do or who i fuck or anything
no i guess thats right i dont
she is frighteningly calm
fuck who you like
his panic mounts
dont you see
dont you see i want you to care
oh i know you do
and i suppose i would if i loved you
but you see i dont think i do anymore
and i only just figured that out
and thats why id just as soon not do any talking right now
she goes back into the kitchen
frank follows her
oh now dont give me this shit
you know god damn well you love me
you think so
you know god damn well
any one home
frank and april stare at each other breathless
frank and the givings sit with cocktails
its painfully awkward
moving boxes are everywhere
im sorry dinners late
can i get anyone a refill
oh dont worry
its nice just to sit for a bit and socialize
you really didnt need to go through all the trouble of cooking
i can see you have a lot to do with packing and what not
frank looks at april
she avoids his look
actually theres been a change of plans
john looks up
frank looks at april
i thought maybe it was obvious
april manages a forced smile
i cant tell you how pleased i am
oh but i expect youll be needing a bigger house now wont you
hold it a second ma
john gets to his feet
i dont get this
he fixes frank with the stare of a prosecuting attorney
whats so obvious about it
i mean okay shes pregnant so what
dont people have babies in europe
oh john really
i dont think we need to john holds up a hand
im asking the man a question
if he doesnt want to give me the answer im assuming hell have sense enough to tell me so
suppose we just say that people anywhere arent very well advised to have babies unless they can afford them
nods slowly okay
okay its a question of money
moneys always a good reason
john paces the room with his hands behind his back like a detective at a murder scene
but its hardly ever the real reason
whats the real reason
wife talk you out of it or what
he turns the force of his smile on april
little woman decide she isnt quite ready to quit playing house
she walks across the room and stabs out her cigarette
then immediately lights another
nah nah thats not it
i can tell
she looks too tough
tough and female and adequate as hell
he swings around to face frank
okay then it mustve been you
frank stares back defiantly
john please youre being very john holds up his hand
what happened frank
you get cold feet or what
you decide youre better off here after all
you figure its more comfy here in the old hopeless emptiness after all or franks face
wow that did it
look at his face
whats the matter wheeler
am i getting warm
frank stares at john his rage increasing
givings gets to his feet
all right son
i think wed better be boy
he lets out his braying laugh
april starts to laugh
you know something
i wouldnt be surprised if you knocked her up on purpose just so you could spend the rest of your life hiding behind that maternity dress
that way you never have to find out what hes made of
now look i think thats just about enough out of you
i mean who the hell do you think you are
you come in here and say whatever crazy god damn thing comes into your head and i think its about time someone told you to keep your god damn hes
not well frank
not well my ass
i dont give a damn if hes sick or well or dead or alive he should keep his fucking opinions in the fucking insane asylum where they belong
april stares at frank
lets go son
givings moves john towards the door
givings slowly stands
april is the only one left seated
big man you got there april
he winks at april and puts his hat on
big family man solid citizen
i feel sorry for you
still maybe you deserve each other
matter of fact the way you look right now im beginning to feel sorry for him too
i mean you must give him a pretty bad time if making babies is the only way he can prove hes got a pair of balls
frank lunges at john
givings tries to hold frank back
givings leaps between them
hes not well frank
givings slowly releases frank
he is breathing heavily
all right john
lets get on out to the car now
he guides him from the room
im sorry april im so sorry
sorry sorry sorry
have i said sorry enough times
i am sorry too
damn i bet im just about the sorriest bastard i know
course get right down to it i dont have a whole hell of a lot to be glad about do i
he takes another step towards the door then stops and turns back laughing again
hey but im glad about one thing though
he points a yellow stained finger at aprils stomach
you know what im glad about
im glad im not gonna be that kid
they go out
frank goes to the liquor cabinet pours a whiskey and drinks it
april watches him from across the room
okay okay dont tell me
dont tell me let me guess
i made a disgusting spectacle of myself
he turns to april
and everything that man said is true
isnt that what youre going to say
apparently i dont have to
youre saying it for me
he comes towards her
but youre wrong
why am i wrong
because the man is insane
hes fucking insane
do you know what the definition of insanity is
what is it frank
the inability to relate to another human being
its the inability to love
she looks at him
then she begins to laugh
the in the in the inabil the inability to
she reels around the room her laughter increasingly out of control
oh frank you really are a wonderful talker
if black could be made into white by talking youd be the man for the job
so now im crazy because i dont love you right
is that the point
youre not crazy and you do love me thats the point
he takes a step towards her
all the laughter goes out of her face
she backs away
but i dont
in fact i loathe the sight of you
youre just a boy who made me laugh at a party once and if you come any closer if you touch me or anything i think ill scream
he takes her by the arms
oh baby listen she screams
high and shrill
her eyes wide open cold and perfectly calm
fuck you april
and fuck all your hateful snotty little she slips past him
he goes after her
she pulls a chair into his path
he slings it against the wall
whatre you going to do now
are you going to hit me
to show how much you love me
oh no dont worry i cant be bothered
youre not worth the trouble itd take to hit you
youre not worth the powder itd take to blow you up
youre an empty he begins to shake with anger
youre an empty hollow fucking shell of a woman
what the hell are you living in my house for if you hate me so much
will you answer me that
why the hell do you fuck me
what the hell are you carrying my child for
he points at her belly
why the hell didnt you just get rid of it when you had the chance
listen i got news for you
i wish to god you had
he strides out of the room
frank enters the bedroom and slams the door
he paces slowly calming
he sits on the bed with his head in his hands
his mind racing
then hes on his feet again
he rushes for the door
frank enters running but the kitchen is empty
frank runs out of the room into living room
the living room is empty
he goes straight for the front door
frank bursts out the front and comes to a stop
shes across the street climbing unsteadily into the woods
frank breaks into a sprint
april walks through the woods
frank runs up behind her scrambling through the muddy bracken
april wheels around
dont come any closer
april listen i dont come any closer
cant i even get away from you in the fucking woods
he stops moving
april listen i didnt mean that
honestly i didnt mean what i said
are you still talking
isnt there any way to stop your talking
i need to think
cant you see that
she backs up against a tree trunk looking down at him
please come back
whatre you doing out here
do you want me to scream again frank
because i will if you say another word
i mean it
frank has no choice theyre outside
the neighbors would hear and call the police
he reluctantly backs away then turns back the way he came glancing over his shoulder as he goes
frank stands at the window watching the section of woods where he left april
then he sees her come back across the street
she walks around the side of the house
he turns and runs into the kitchen
frank goes to the window
he watches april walk up into the yard and stop against a tree
frank pours a drink and takes the bottle with him to the window
he looks out drinking
in the darkness he can make out the glow of aprils cigarette deep in the woods
frank falls back on the bed
hes now very drunk
his eyes close as he slips into unconsciousness
frank wakes alone
he looks around the room
his head is throbbing
frank stands in the doorway dressed for work
the kitchen has been tidied and is bathed in sunlight
the table has been carefully set for two
april stands at the stove wearing a fresh maternity dress
she seems serene
april turns and looks at him
he stands there frozen
would you like scrambled eggs or fried
it doesnt really matter uh
scrambled i guess if its easy
ill have scrambled too
frank sits at the table
frank and april sit across the kitchen table eating
for several moments only the sound of their cutlery
its kinda nice having breakfast without the kids for a change
april reaches out to pour him some orange juice
her hands shake slightly
i thought youd probably want a good breakfast today
i mean its kind of an important day for you isnt it
isnt this the day you have your conference with pollock
thats right yes
i imagine it is a pretty big deal for them anyway
what exactly do you think youll be doing
you never have told me much about it
i think this whole thing is about knox getting ready to buy up one of these really big computers bigger than the
did i tell you about that
no i dont believe you did
well you know basically its just a
a big fast adding machine
he takes a pencil from his inside pocket and delicately sketches the computer on the napkin
instead of mechanical parts you see its got thousands of little individual vacuum tubes
she picks up the drawing and looks at it
its surprisingly delicate
oh i see
at least i think i see yes
its really sort of interesting isnt it
well i dont know its yeah i guess it is sort of interesting in a way
you should value what you do frank
youre obviously good at it
he smiles flattered and surprised
he slips the pencil into the inside pocket of his suit
guess id better be getting started
april stands up too smoothing her skirt
listen though april this was really nice
i mean it was a swell breakfast
really i dont know when ive ever had a a nicer breakfast
im glad i enjoyed it too
they stand there gazing at one another across the table
suddenly inexplicably his eyes are filled with tears
he turns and walks to the door
he puts his hand on the handle and turns back once more
then you dont you dont hate me or anything
no of course i dont
she comes over to him
have a good day
he leans down and kisses her tenderly
they look at one another a moment longer
he steps through the door
she catches the door before it shuts and watches him through the screen
april walks out onto the driveway as the car reverses away down the drive
frank backs the car onto the road
he slides the car into drive and then catches sight of april in the driveway
april sees frank looking back at her
frank waves from the car and drives off
then april is alone
she shivers from the morning chill
she turns and looks back at the house
april enters through the screen door and goes to the table
she looks down at franks diagram and carefully places it aside
she carries the dishes to the sink and begins to wash them
suddenly her body convulses as she tries to hold back from crying
and then there is no stopping the tears
april is standing by the phone with her hand on the receiver rehearsing
she is smoking
everything all right
my voice sounds what
april uses both hands to grip the receiver
well no im afraid im not feeling any better
if its not an inconvenience for you
this evening would be great
oh well no not if theyre outdoors playing
dont call them in
the cigarette shreds in aprils hand
just give them you know give them each a kiss for me and give them my love and tell them you know
all right milly
she hangs up and begins to cry again
takes a breath
we move behind april as she walks through the silent house
the distant sound of children playing outside
each room she passes is a pocket of silence
april makes the bed
she arranges her shoes on the floor of the closet
april reaches onto a shelf behind some clothes
pulls out the brown paper package
april stands at the stove over a pot of rolling boiling water
she removes the rubber syringe from its paper packaging and drops it into the pot
she checks her watch
april carries the pot of boiling sudsy water down the hall
april places the pot into the tub
she lays towels across the floor
and closes the door
the sound of running water
the empty mirror
aprils face rises up into the reflection with a gasp
we move with april down the hallway her face is pale
now april stands at the picture window
she is shaking
a droplet of blood slides down her knee
she looks down
on the floor two droplets of blood appear between her bare feet
now we see the bright maple leaf of blood seeping through her skirt
she is shaking more
she walks slowly out of the room towards the kitchen
i think i need an ambulance
one one five revolutionary road
milly folds laundry
she looks up to see an ambulance turns into the wheelers driveway
her face clouds with instinctual foreboding
shep steps out into a hospital hallway
frank paces helpless in the waiting room his face a mask of bewildered childlike confusion
he looks up to see shep coming towards him
they tell you what happened
i couldnt even understand half the things he told me
he said the fetus was out before they got her here
he said they had to operate to take out the whatdycallit the placenta and now shes still bleeding
he said shed lost a lot of blood before the ambulance came and now theyre trying to stop it and he said a whole lot of things i didnt get
about capillaries and he said shes unconscious
how about sitting down frank
what the hell do i want to sit down for
take it easy
here have a cigarette
shep offers the pack
frank doesnt take one
she did it to herself shep
sheps face as he realizes what hes saying
she did it to herself
shep takes a cigarette for himself
he lights it with trembling fingers
ill get some coffee
frank looks over at shep as if hed forgotten him
shep stands and walks down the hall
shep stands at a coffee machine gathering himself
he looks up
he begins to feed coins into the machine
his hands are trembling
he drops a coin
it rolls under the machine
he has to get down on his hands and knees to retrieve it
shep walks tentatively holding a cup in each hand slopping coffee onto the floor
he rounds the corner and stops
frank is no longer in his chair at the end of the long echoing hallway
shep looks around
then suddenly the double doors are flung open and a number of nurses hurry out
behind them comes frank supported by two doctors
shep runs to them as they move frank over to a chair
hes in shock
they try to make him sit but he stays stubbornly on his feet the chair skidding behind him
try to sit down mr
sit down frank
frank looks at shep his face is a terrifying blank
a toyland of white and pastel houses along the road
the crisp green lawns
the blue televisions flickering behind the glass
we hear the whisk of running footsteps on the asphalt the rush of a mans breath
frank is running down the middle of the street tears streaming silently down his face
four high ball glasses with glistening cubes of ice
shep puts the finishing touches on four drinks
brace a pleasant looking young couple fresh from the city sit on the couch
it was the worst experience of my life
such wonderful people
werent they shep
shep picks up the drinks and carries them across the room
he stands there beside the three of them but he cant bring himself to sit down and join in
frank lives in the city now
where is it he works
bart pollock associates
brace removes his pipe and looks at it
have you seen him since
too many memories i think
sheps seen him
in the city
hes just dedicated to those kids
every spare moment he has he spends with them
shep turns and walks out of the room
shep walks across the lawn to the edge of the property
he looks out over the suburban houses
at what was once the wheeler house
sheps face looking out
his eyes are filled with tears
milly comes up behind him
she takes his arm and holds him close
i dont want to talk about the wheelers any more
we dont have to
we dont have to
shep and milly look out over revolutionary road
the same silence over a beautiful day in the city
and from the silence the faint sound of wind through the leafy branches of trees
two children play in a playground in a small park
its jennifer and michael
they seem happy engrossed
other kids play around them
watching them from a bench is frank
he is a little older a little thinner
close on franks face
the sound of his children playing
givings crouches on a cotton work sheet painting varnish onto a chair
givings sits reading the paper
a new puppy sleeps curled up on the rug nearby
i cant tell you how pleased i am about the little revolutionary road place howard
remember how dreary it looked all winter
all cold and dark and well spooky
and now whenever i drive past it gives me such a lift to see it all perked up and spanking clean again with lights in the windows
and do you know i was just thinking ive loved that little house for years and the braces are the first really suitable people ive ever found for it
really nice congenial people i mean
givings fiddles with his hearing aid
well except for the wheelers you mean
oh i was very fond of the wheelers but they always were a bit a bit whimsical for my taste
a bit neurotic
i may not have stressed it but they were often very trying people to deal with in many ways
actually the main reason the little house has been so hard to sell is that they let it depreciate so dreadfully
warped window frames wet cellar crayon marks on the walls filthy smudges around all the mr
givings reaches up to his ear and suddenly
but for the faint sound of wind
he gazes out the window as behind him mrs
givings continues to talk but we cant hear a thing
he has turned off his hearing aid
