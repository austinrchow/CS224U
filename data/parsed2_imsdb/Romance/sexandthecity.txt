written by michael patrick king glistening city buildings reflect onto the window of an upscale clothing boutique
in the window a mannequin is wearing the best of everything
a pretty twenty something girl looks in at the display dreaming of the day
year after year twenty something women come to new york city in search of the two ls labels and love
four twenty something women walk away from us arms linked laughing they make their way down the busy street shopping bags and designer purses swinging
the young women reveal carrie bradshaw and fabulous walking towards us
she watches them as they pass a smile grows on her face
twenty years ago
i was one of them
she walks along her shopping bag swinging
carrie on step ladder barefoot
her finger moves along a series of designer shoe boxes
having gotten the knack for labels early
i concentrated on my search for love
carrie walks along
turns out a knock off is not as easy to spot when comes to love
she passes a twenty something girl and guy huddled very close together
suddenly the girl slaps him across the face
until it is
carrie reacts and trots along
carrie and preppy perfect charlotte walk along talking
that is why you need help to spot them
jump cut to carrie charlotte and miranda walk along talking
lots of help
jump cut to carrie charlotte miranda and samantha walk along laughing their shopping bags and designer purses swinging
the front of carries building

the doorman tips his hat and opens the door
carrie and big walk through the beautiful lobby and over to the elevator

they laugh a little as the doors close on the elevator
a door is opened up by carol their real estate agent

a male building agent stands here
the smiles leave carrie and bigs faces
to big thirty four

the agent reaches over and presses the ph button on the control panel
carrie and big react

carrie puts her arm around her
jealous of me living in this gorgeous penthouse in manhattan

new york magazine said brooklyn is the new manhattan
whoever wrote that lives in brooklyn
there she is
samantha is standing out in front of christies
she waves to them as she finishes a call
on phone samantha jones
smith jerrods manager im in new york till monday
she hangs up as they reach her
how was your flight
lets go in i am so excited
a lobby bustling with new york women
carrie samantha charlotte and miranda make their way through them
it was a rare occasion that brought all types of women together
the socialites the trendies the yuppies the yentas
the girls gently move past by an elderly yenta who reacts
why the pushing
carrie and the girls enter a room filled with dramatically lit jewelry cases that display amazing jewelry
on the walls around the gallery are large photos of a beautiful raven haired woman
she is captured in candid poses out and about new york city at various social events wearing the jewelry on display
blair elkenn was a waitress turned model turned actress turned billionaires girlfriend who came home one night to find herself unceremoniously turned out on the street
samantha carrie and charlotte page through the catalogues as they walk
miranda types on her blackberry
and now she was getting the ultimate break up revenge
an embarrassing and very public auction of all the jewelry he had given her when they were happy
the girls stop
floating in a case at their eye level is a unique two finger flower ring made out of diamonds
there it is
and shes a beauty
when i saw this in the catalogue i said to smith this flower ring is the essence of me
one of a kind filled with fire
and a little too much
lets go spend some of my hard earned hollywood money
they make their way to the auction room
hey whats coming up on smiths series
is he going to sleep with that new blonde neurosurgeon
he sleeps with every hot woman doctor in that hospital
dont you ever get weirded out by seeing smith in bed with all those other women
no i think its hot
sometimes when im alone i masturbate right along with them
and people say the golden age of television is over
besides its fake sex
when theyre doing it no ones actually turned on
kinda like steve and i
beat then but come one its been seven years
he does that i do this
its not like a new plot twist is going to turn up
a distinguished woman auctioneer is at a podium
the flower ring
samantha sits up ready
an electric buzz moves through the crowd
if schadenfreude is the word for feeling pleasure at someone else misfortune this was jewelryfreude
lets start the bidding at ten thousand
samantha raises her number
the auctioneer nods
thank you madame
do i hear fifteen
a woman in a business suit on a phone raises her number
samantha looks over at her
and the gloves are off
do i hear twenty
samantha raises her number
do i hear twenty five
the woman raises her number
samantha raises her number
carries eyes widen
the woman is talking with someone on the phone
shes bidding for someone on the phone
thats not fair
the woman raises her hand
charlotte gives her a look
i deserve this
i work hard
do i hear forty
samantha raises her hand
do i hear forty fi the woman quickly raises her hand
sex with only one man for i dont know how long

a laugh ripples through the room
samantha glares at the rival woman almost daring her
carrie looks afraid
the woman raises her hand
samantha reacts disappointed
the auctioneer looks at samantha
sixty to our colorful bidder
to carrie i draw the line at fifty
samantha shakes her head no
carrie rubs her arm
carrie samantha miranda and charlotte are primping in front of the mirror
i thought this auction would be more fun
but its kinda sad
a baby voiced woman next to charlotte overhears
they look over at her
i thought it was just sad for me cause i know her
but its really sad huh
and its funny cause they were so happy
till they werent i know right
we all told her to get married but she didnt want to push him
hed been married three other times
so she let it ride and then she came home one night and he had locked her out
she didnt even have anywhere to live
after ten years
such a shame
she was a smart girl till she fell in love
carrie catches mirandas eye in the mirror looks away
big takes a bright red lobster out of a pot of hot water with tongs
he places it next to another cooked lobster
he walks to the cooking island where carrie sits sipping wine
the creatures are ready
just gonna sit there
im not sitting im thinking
husk and think
he winks puts two ears of corn in front of her then starts chopping tomatoes
im thinking im going to sell my apartment and put the money towards heaven on fifth
you love your place

you write there
its your office
theres plenty of room at the new place and besides
i want to make us a life there
i want it to be ours

i bought it for us
and thats so amazing but you bought it so its really your place

i didnt think it was an option
bradshaw what if it was an option
she hits him with a husk

he puts out his hand
she takes it and they shake
you gotta do better on that corn

she looks down at her corn hes right
crowded serious lunch crowd
carrie sits across from charlotte and miranda
miranda is in a work suit
so the other night big and i were talking about you know moving in together and our future
charlottes eyes are getting wider and wider
and about what makes sense as we move forward
we decided to get married
charlottes screams at the top of her lungs
carrie and miranda and the entire restaurant react
and im deaf
everyones looking charlotte looks around at the disgruntled faces
she half stands and address the diners looking at her
but my friend here just got engaged and shes been going out with the man for ten years
the diners bursts into applause
carrie slumps in her chair pulls up her sweater collar turns to miranda
i am mortified
there is literally a ringing in my ear
a large photo of smith
samantha walks past it and up a sleek modern office building stairway
her cell rings
samantha jones intercut with carrie walking through the upscale boutique talking on her pink swarovski crystal covered cell phone
i made a little decision that i hope youll be happy about
you finally got botox
i did not get botox im telling you carrie youll love it
i did not call to talk about botox
im just saying
samantha reaches the top of the stairs
blow ups of smith on various magazine covers line the walls of the chic small office space
last week after the auction i started thinking about my options
well big and i decided to get married
you sounded more excited about the botox
well honey i am excited for you but you know me
i dont really believe in marriage
botox on the other hand that works every time
a receptionist hands her some messages
honey ive got to go
the people magazine person is on hold
smiths on the short list to be their sexiest man alive
we can catch up when im in town next week
samantha hangs up
carrie looks at her phone dismissed and disappointed
she closes it and walks on
carrie rounds a corner
her phone rings
intercut with samantha standing in her office
i think i was in shock
i mean its you getting married
this is not some random person its you
i hear ya
and i guess i thought that after that big mess with aidan youd never want to get married
so i put you in my were never getting married file
now ive got to take you out of that file
sorry about the extra paper work

samantha it feels so different this time
no cliche romantic kneeling down on one knee
just you know two grown ups making a decision about spending their lives together
well im happy for you
and one more thing
i want you to be maid of honor
how do you feel about that
the same way you feel about botox
painful and unnecessary
carrie and charlotte sit on her bed looking through a list of names
anthony sits at her makeup vanity
he has a large notebook open in front of him
seventy six guests
seventy five sounds better
a small wedding of seventy five guests
carrie looks at the list
as a wedding gift charlotte had given me anthony marantino friend and wedding planner
carrie crosses someone off
charlotte reacts shocked
she was borderline anyway

carrie gets up and goes into the closet
anthony hurries over and sits next to charlotte
this is going to be good
im so excited

anthony and charlotte grab hands in anticipation as carrie comes out of her closet
she holds up a simple off white vintage suit
charlotte and anthony deflate
that was the exact reaction i was aiming for
no its pretty but its so simple
simple and classic
when i saw it i just thought that is what i should marry big in
well whos it by
i found it in a vintage shop
the bride wore a dress by no one
she turns and heads back into the closet
as she goes dont worry ill style it up with shoes
anthony turns to charlotte and says in a low voice
the invitation is fancier than the dress
i heard that
a family style italian restaurant
miranda in business clothes sits with steve brady and magda
bradys face is covered in spaghetti sauce
and from anthony marantino to spaghetti marinara

the clock on the bed table reads
samantha sits in the jacuzzi wearing her ring sipping a glass of wine bored
one glass of merlot and two orgasms later
samantha hears moaning
the sounds of someone having sex in the house right next door
she looks from the hot tub she can see her neighbor dante hot dark sex on a stick in his living room making wild love to a red haired woman

samantha watches and sips not so bored
and that is how samantha learned she had a new neighbor
carrie enters the apartment

as she steps out onto the terrace
big comes up behind her
he leans her against the door jamb and kisses her
he kisses her sliding down the front of her body
big is in bed wearing half glasses reading the wall street journal
carrie enters from the bathroom and hops into bed
she grabs a library book from the night stand and looks over

carrie runs past the stone lions and up the grand stairs holding three library books in her hand
carrie stands at the entrance while a female guard checks the contents of her purse
a floral delivery man comes in carrying a gorgeous arrangement of white flowers
he calls to the guard

carrie peeks around the closet and looks in
the gown is hanging next to the white suit dwarfing it
and just like that vivienne westwood kicked my sweet little suits ass
big leads carrie into their new bedroom by the hand
her eyes are closed and she has a designer shopping bag slung over her one arm
he moves her around the construction debris stopping in front of the new closets double doors
carrie opens her eyes

she opens the closet doors revealing a beautiful oversized walk in closet with shelves and more shelves and places for shoes and more shoes

samantha looks at stanford and anthony speechless
the limo driver slams the limo door

bigs car pulls over as the limo approaches
big powers down his window as the limo passes he sees carrie in the window resting her head against the glass listless
carrie looks up and sees big
he smiles an apologetically smile
her limo keeps on moving
big watches it go
the limo screeches to a halt
the back door flies open and carrie almost leaps out
big sees her he looks relieved
she hurries up the street to bigs car holding her bouquet
big gets out of his car just as carrie reaches him
i freaked out for a minute but im ready now carrie hits him with her bouquet
its a violent direct hit on his face
she hits him again hard
a wounded sound escaping her throat
she hits him again
he ducks back into the car for protection
she hits the bouquet on the roof of the car the flowers start breaking apart and flying everywhere
i knew you would do this i knew it
miranda reaches carrie and holds her back by her waist
big gets back out of the car and starts over to her

carrie starts crying
charlotte has arrived
carrie turns and falls into her arms
miranda and charlotte lead her away
big starts over to follow

he stops in his tracks
a waitress s at the brant park cafe nearby over pours water into a customers glass riveted by the scene

a cab comes down the street and honks at big standing in the road dazed
carrie sits in a chair
she is holding a glass and has an hermes blanket wrapped around her
miranda sits nearby holding a bottle of vodka
samantha paces working on her iphone
i thought i would still be in extreme pain but im feeling nothing

she sips looking sad
charlotte leans down and tucks in the sleeping lily
she picks up a chinese baby doll and nestles it under lilys arm then turns and starts out
miranda is standing in the hall as charlotte enters from lilys room

carries hair blows in the breeze her sunglasses firmly in place
a gorgeous romantic private house surrounded by tropical splendor
the cart arrives in front
the doors are open and paulo the butler stands there holding a tray with two beautiful tropical drinks
he is surprised when he sees the four women but he covers effortlessly

carrie gets out of the cart and goes into the house followed by charlotte and miranda
samantha arrives and picks up a drink off the tray

carrie stands looking in the mirror
she takes off her sunglasses
her eyes are red red red
she splashes water on her face and looks at herself in the beautiful mexican mirror
paulo leads miranda charlotte and samantha into the romantic bedroom suite
on the bed rose petals are scattered in the shape of a large heart
oh my god
miranda and charlotte quickly grab the bed cover and jerk it up throwing all the rose petals off
miranda addresses him in a very intense whisper

carrie exits the powder room her sunglasses in her hand
she stands in the entry way alone
she looks out at the main room the beautiful view the romance
her eyes start to water
a porter enters with the bags
carrie hides her face acknowledging him with a nod
carrie enters and moves directly to the bed past charlotte where miranda is sitting talking on her cell
magda ill talk to you tomorrow miranda hangs up as carrie crawls onto the bed and lays down
the pink sunset light floods across her face
well its a gorgeous sunset
close the shutters
paulo moves over to the window and starts closing the shutters
the sun is slowly shuttered out
all of them
carrie closes her eyes
darkness falls across her face
the room is dark except for the bright sunlight straining to get in between the cracks of the closed shutters
carrie is asleep
miranda sits on the bed
carrie stirs half waking

miranda shakes her head no
carrie closes her eyes falls back asleep
carrie is still asleep
charlotte sits on the bed
she gently shakes carrie
carrie opens her eyes

charlotte exhales concerned
a tingling of glass sound wakes carrie
she opens her eyes and looks
samantha is just sitting on the bed with a breakfast tray

samantha holds up a bowl of yogurt
carrie adjusts on her pillows a little
samantha feeds carrie a spoonful of yogurt
carrie looks at her
samantha miranda and charlotte are sitting having lunch
charlotte opens a pre packaged snack pack chocolate pudding

samantha looks over at her and notices something
miranda looks up at samantha
samantha indicates her swimsuit crotch area
which is badly in need of a wax
miranda grabs her towel and covers her crotch area
i didnt know i was going to be in a swimsuit
carrie and charlotte look up from their magazines

she walks away
samantha calls after her

miranda goes inside
carries throws her magazine down

they look at her she sips her cocktail
i cant believe my life revolves around a man

carrie slips silently away
charlotte gets up and starts away after her
miranda looks should i charlotte shakes her head not sure

samantha and miranda have just gathered their things and are leaving their chairs as charlotte and carrie return
we thought we were leaving
charlotte shakes her head no
samantha and miranda turn around and start back to their seats as music starts
the girls settle in just as a model starts down the runway in gorgeous clothes
carrie miranda charlotte and samantha watch dissolve to the girls watching another model another outfit
they point and discuss what they see loving it
dissolve to the girls watching another model another outfit
with each outfit carrie seems to lighten and brighten
dissolve to the girls watching another model another outfit
carrie smiles as she watches now truly enjoying herself
carrie is being interviewed by elaine holding a tape recorder
miranda samantha and charlotte watch nearby
i didnt know if it was the fashion or the fact that the four of us were together again but for the first time in a long time i felt
the girls leave the tent and start down the stairs
lets get a cab i am starv splat
her fur coat is hit with splash of red paint
they react shocked
an activist woman stands there holding a paint cup
next to her another activist is holding a pug dog
fur is murder
beat god i miss new york
carrie hurries across the street and a couple of weeks later i met st
louis boyfriend will
she arrives at the front of a restaurant
through the window she can see louise sitting next to will
louise spots carrie and waves
carrie waves back and starts in
over christmas they realized how much they loved each other
just in time for valentines day
carrie turns the key in her mail box
a little pink envelope sits there
she takes it out and opens it
its a kids style valentine card of cinderella
she turns it over
lilys crayon mark mixes with charlottes handwriting to aunt carrie
carrie opens the door holding the valentine
her phone is ringing
she answers it
intercut with samantha in her kitchen attempting to make sushi
her hands covered in rice
the dog wearing a sweater with a heart on it sits on the floor watching
im just calling to make sure you arent hanging from your shower rod
you called an hour too early
so whats the v day plan
miranda and i are going to dinner and then a really violent slasher movie
i am making smith sushi
pause for reaction
do you make sushi
we took a class a while back and when he walks in the door at seven thirty i am going to surprise him by laying on the dining room table
covered with homemade sushi
boy you do have time on your hands
carrie walks over to the book shelf and places the cinderella valentine on it
she looks down at the bottom shelf
the vogue magazine is looking up at her she picks it up
a small village restaurant festively decorated for valentines day
pink balloons float on the ceiling their red ribbon strings hang at eye level
carrie and miranda sit at a table
at all the other tables couples
is it me or is valentines day this year on steroids
i think it was like this last year but we played for the other team
a waitress approaches them with pink menus
heres our special valentine night menu
all the selections are romantic in theme and designed to be split for two
are you having wine
a glass or a bot bottle
ill be right back to take you and your girlfriends order
the waitress leaves
miranda looks at carrie
i could do a lot worse
the wine bottle is now empty
carrie and miranda eat
why would you look at the vogue today of all days
cause im an emotional cutter
beat then i deserve what i got
running all over new york believing that im finally getting my happy ending
see everyone love does conquer all
look at me in my one of a kind wedding gown marrying the love of my life
waitress stops at the table
she picks up the bottle
would you like another bot yes
in that article i did not say we once
it was all i want and i think
it was from your point of view
my point of view
the whole wedding was my point of view
i let the wedding get bigger than big
i am the reason he didnt get out of that car
you cant put this all on yourself
beat then okay
i said something i shouldnt have said to big at the rehearsal dinner
what do you mean
i was really upset after steve showed up and i bumped into big and i said that you two were crazy to get married
carrie is stunned
the waitress arrives with the new bottle of wine
here we go
she is opening the bottle
she pops the cork starts to pour
stop its fine thanks
the waitress puts the bottle down and walks away
im sorry i was upset steve had i have been going over this and over this in my mind for five months and for five months you kept a secret
i tried to tell you once but the vogue article came out once
you tried to tell me once
you should have tried to tell me every single day
i know i was looking for the right time
there is no right time to tell me you ruined my marriage
the room is now at attention
it just happened i wasnt thinking
carrie grabs her purse to leave
carrie please dont go i carrie stands up the festive balloon strings bob in front of her face
she pushes them away
and i think what hurts the most is that you kept a secret from me
i have never ever kept a secret from you
she starts out
stops comes back through the ribbons
no im lying
for the last five months ive been thinking that its a huge mistake that you left steve
how does it feel
she turns and pushes balloons out of her way as she starts out
a kissing couple s is blocking her way
they stop she squeezes by them
miranda is devastated
candles are lit
samantha enters wearing a sexy sheer robe and carrying a giant tray of homemade sushi
the phone rings
the machine picks up
smith leaves a message
babe were way behind on set
i still havent been released
ill get there as soon as i can
she sighs places the tray on the table
looks at the wall clock seven thirty
samantha is sitting in the robe near the table
eight thirty samantha is pacing
she takes a piece of sushi pops it in her mouth and chews pissed
a woman moaning is heard
she walks over and glances out the window into dantes living room
candles are everywhere he is naked and giving head to naked blonde woman
she is writhing in pleasure
samantha watches even more pissed
it was the same valentine night samantha had planned minus the sushi
samantha now wearing sweat clothes sits with her arms crossed waiting
the door opens and smith enters
he sees samantha sitting there
man that was a long day the crew went into double overtime
you are three hours late
did you eat
yes i ate
i ate the sushi that i hand made for you
the sushi that i planned to lay all over my naked body as a valentines surprise for you
why are you so upset
i slaved away in a kitchen all day to make this meal for you
you made some sushi its not a big deal
not a big deal
she stands up
she picks up some pieces of sushi
you see this this took me five fucking hours
she throws sushi at him
he dodges them
i am not the type of woman who sits home all day waiting for a man
beat you love california so much enjoy your hand made california roll
she throws more sushi and storms out
smith looks at the subzero fridge
a sushi piece slides down the front
a floral arrangement sits on the hall table next to the answering machine
a card reading im sorry miranda is nearby
the answering machine is recording an incoming call from miranda
are you there
carrie is standing in the bathroom looking out at the answering machine brushing her teeth
three days of im sorry calls and e mails and flowers and i still wasnt ready
it was the longest wed even gone without speaking
carrie walks up to her stoop
a cab idling in front
the cab window goes down
miranda is sitting there
i need to talk to you
how long have you been waiting here
miranda looks to the meter then back to her
seventeen dollars long
beat please get in
it just turned to eighteen
carrie looks at her hesitates starts over to the cab
rain pours down the windows
carrie and miranda sit in silence
a middle eastern driver sits behind the wheel
close on the meter
this is weird not talking
carrie i understand but it just happened i never meant to hurt you
beat you have to forgive me
carrie looks over at her
what were you going to say
you badger me to forgive you in three days and you wont even consider forgiving steve for something he did six months ago
its not the same thing
miranda thinks carrie looks at her
and i know youre not the reason my marriage fell apart
i was just desperate to have someone else to blame
the meter clicks
steve and miranda are sitting in front of a therapist
i dont know if i can trust that it wont happen again
steve youre very quiet today
miranda i know i made it hard for you to trust me
but you made it hard for me to trust you
the way you treated me and cut me out of your life like that
i mean yeah i broke a vow
but what about the other vows
like promising to love someone for better or for worse
what about that
miranda looks down at her hands
steve looks at the therapist
how do i know she wont punish me for the rest of my life
and she doesnt know for sure that you wont have another indiscretion
beat all you can know
is that you want to move forward and risk that you love for each other wont allow that to happen
and thats what well discover here
steve looks over at miranda
miranda looks at steve
forsythia bushes are in bloom
carrie and miranda walk
they carry sandwiches
so were done with our last session and were not allowed to talk for two weeks while we figure out if being together again is something we really want
and then we had to pick a place to meet and if we both show up on that day the past no longer exists
showing up is the promise we make to each other that were willing to let it all go and move forward
can you do that
i dont know
i have a lot of thinking to do
thinking or feeling
what do you mean
miranda youre a lawyer
you can argue both sides of any case but why we feel what we feel isnt logical
sorry harvard im afraid youre going to have to make this decision based on your emotions
well then im screwed
i dont know what i feel
there will come a moment when youll know
and if its yes all that brilliant logic will go out the window
with the past
and i thought picking the place to meet was a challenge
where is it
the brooklyn bridge
halfway between both our places
and yet poetic
poetic if we both show up
otherwise youre on a bridge rejected
not a good plan
carrie walks in carrying a starbucks cardboard caddy with two coffee
louise is sitting at her desk working
i have two pieces of good news
and i have two coffees
i just got a heads up from your realtor
the apartment on fifth finally sold
carrie sips coffee
you have sixty days before the new owner takes possession and you are out of there

louise holds up her hand
there is a diamond ring on it
oh my god im moving back to st
louis we are getting married in the fall
carrie hugs her
samantha is sitting on the beach reading the secret
meanwhile back in lost angeles
she rolls her eyes and tosses it down in the sand
samantha walks on the beach
the dog is walking with her
samantha had money a career and a man who loved her
still she couldnt shake the feeling that something was missing from her life
the dog runs up onto the neighbors deck
come back here
samantha is on the neighbors deck looking for the dog
where are you baby
she rounds a corner and comes face to face with dante showering in the outdoor shower
water runs over his naked and perfect body
he sees her and smiles a hot smile
she is thrown overwhelmed
sorry im your neighbor and my dog ran up on your dick catching herself deck
there is a growl sound
she looks the dog is humping a towel on the deck floor
she looks back at dante

speechless she shakes her head no she scoops up the dog and hurries away
he calls after her
stop by anytime
samantha takes a peek back and continues on her way
samantha is having lunch outside while on the phone
smith is interested but the dates will have to work with the series
dante appears on the deck next store in a wet suit
he unzips it while looking at samantha
samantha dips a chip in guacamole and eats it
he pulls his wet suit down and smiles at her
she dips another chip
he steps out of it and looks at her almost torturing her
she looks the other way dips another chip in guacamole and eats it
samantha is in the kitchen on the phone
she picks up a slice of messy pizza from a delivery box on the table
we agreed that no one else from the show but smith was going to be on the cover
she walks to the window and looks out
dante is on his deck putting on sun screen
samantha is in the jacuzzi she is looking up at dante who is on his deck smoking a joint
he indicates for her to come over
she shakes her head no
he walks away
she presses a button on the control panel
the jacuzzi jets start
she re positions herself on them then
she reaches over and grabs a giant hot fudge sundae and
starts eating it
miranda sits in the window having a cappuccino alone
on the table a legal pad with a list of pros and cons
with her two weeks just about up mirandas list of pros and cons were equal
she throws some money down on the table and takes a final sip on her cappuccino
as she stands up she catches sight of herself in the mirrored wall
cappuccino foam covers her top lip
miranda stands on the bridge
she looks at her watch
it suddenly dawned on miranda that steves list might have had more cons then pros
just as this reality hits the crowd parts and steve is seen running up the bridge
miranda and steve walk along the bridge towards brooklyn
and miranda never looked back
steve and miranda are making love it is passionate
well almost never
miranda turns her head back to look at steve
carries apartment is transformed
it is sleeker polished more grown up with a warm modern feel
and at home everything felt and looked different and yet still very much me

samantha opens the door

samantha is sitting with charlotte and miranda and carrie
they are having coffee

i dont know if theres anything to be proud of
i stuff my face to stop myself from doing something that feels natural to me
carrie reaches over and rubs samanthas back
why didnt you say something

and when youre in denial you dont dial
now listen this isnt about the weight

but are you happy
silence then relationships arent always about being happy right

she notices the gardenia ring on her finger
she starts to take it off

samantha sits in first class
she is crying
while eating a hot fudge sundae

samantha nods and finishes eating the hot fudge sundae as fast as she can
scraping almost licking the bowl
as someone returned to my life
carrie stands at the door with louise

samantha walks past lovro and magda sitting on chairs out front sipping ice tea and up to mirandas lower east side apartment stoop with the dog on the leash
samantha moved in
the hot tattooed latin guy is still sitting on the stoop out front with the ferocious looking pitbull
she starts up the stairs

samantha looks down
the dog is humping the pitbull
diego nods approval
a very very pregnant charlotte carrying shopping bags is being seated at a banquette by the hostess

i think he was hoping to see you
carrie is having a hard time with this

harry and charlotte give each other a sad glance
carrie walks out of charlottes room with harry
shes a doll
she kisses harry on the cheek and starts away
he asked me to ask you to call him
looks at him
its none of my business
but i felt bad for the poor schmuck hanging around the hospital waiting room hoping to see you
i swear every time he heard someone in heels coming down the hall his heart stopped
harry its so much more complicated than you can imagine
i know it is and you have every right to never call him but im just a big pile of love today and i feel bad for the guy
he said hes been writing you but you never responded
beat then hes never written me
he said he wrote because he didnt have your phone number

carrie looks at harry
carrie enters her apartment
she glances over at her bookcase remembers
jump cut to carrie opens the bookcase drawer and takes out a manila envelope marked p
jump cut to carrie dumps the contents of the envelopes on the desk
jump cut to carrie quickly sorts through the mail looking looking for something
a letter something
nothing from him
she leans back in her chair more confused
her eyes drift up to her computer
she wonders if jump cut to carrie is logging onto carriebradshaw
she types in password
jump cut to carriebradshaw
coms welcome page
she clicks on email
jump cut to carrie scans through emails none are from big
frustrated she logs off
carrie is still at her desk lost in thought
two hours two manila envelopes and countless emails later i was just about to give up on the big riddle when she looks back at her computer screen and notices
carrie sits up
clicks on it
i had told louise to put big in a place where i would never have to hear from him again
she types in her password
picks up her phone
dials a number
hey louise its me
whats the password to get into your assistant file
she hangs up and places the phone on a pile of mail which causes the mail to fall over onto the floor
carrie reaches down to pick up the mail she notices the love key chain has fallen as well
she picks it up and looks at it has a hunch
oh my god
jump cut to carrie types the password l o v e
the file opens her eyes widen
there on the screen are many many many emails all from jjp

carrie drops the phone and jumps up
carrie runs down the stairs
she spots a passing cab
it screeches to a halt
she runs to the cab
carrie steps into the elevator
she presses ph steps back
the doors close
key in the lock carrie enters
she looks around
the light in our pre war apartment looked completely different post war
carrie walks into the bedroom and over to the closet
she pushes open the other double door
big standing there holding the manolos in his hands
he looks up surprised by her
i was going to get these to you
i didnt want it to be a total loss
it wasnt logic it was love
she walks into the closet and over to him
she throws her arms around him
he drops the shoes
very very passionate
carrie and big are nestled up next to each other on the carpeted floor of the empty walk in closet
his suit jacket is off
her shoes are off
why did we ever decide to get married
beat then i guess we were afraid it meant something if we didnt
she looks at him and nods
im sorry to have done that to you
she touches his lips
im sorry to have done that to you
beat and you know the funny part
is there a funny part
we were perfectly happy before we decided to live happily ever after
the jokes on us
she looks around
is this what you had in mind when you installed the carpet
id like to think i was that smooth
we better get up before the new owner bust in on us
they start to get up
carrie rises first
he starts to get up first sitting on his side
and the way we decided to get married all business
thats not the way you propose to someone
he moves further up onto one knee where he stops
she looks down at him is this happening
he holds out his hand
she places her hand in his
carrie bradshaw love of my life will you marry me
it is everything carrie bradshaw had convinced herself would never happen
could never happen
and here it is

he notices her never worn manolo on the floor
he picks it up
holds it out to her
she lifts her foot and places it in the shoe
carrie stands with big in front of a judge
she is wearing the simple white suit and her never worn manolos from the closet
and in the end
carrie bradshaw married john james preston in a label less dress
by the power vested in me by the state of new york i now pronounce you husband and wife

big and carrie kiss
then he whispers into her ear
carrie and big walk through the courthouse lobby toward the front door holding hands
you okay that it was just us
you and me like i said
would have been nice if you had the girls here
he holds the door open for her as they walk outside
carrie and big walk out of the courthouse into the sun
which is why i called them
miranda charlotte and a more slender samantha are standing there
they scream and throw rice
as the rice hits
carrie screams and big laughs
a guard hurries over to them
carrie is spitting out rice
excuse me excuse me
youre not allowed to throw rice anymore
honey get over it its new york
she winks at the guard
he shrugs and walks away
big carrie miranda steve brady charlotte harry lily rose stanford samantha are casually gathered around a couple of tables that have been pushed together
a waitress comes over balancing hot plates
who had the ham and eggs
big raises his arm
the waitress hands the plate down
carrie intercepts it and places it in front of big
it wasnt a fancy designer reception either
just food and friends
the waitress hands out the other breakfasts
samantha feeds bacon to the dog who is wearing a tiny bridal veil on his head
carries books are displayed on a book kiosk
carrie stands in front of it reading to a crowd from the galleys of her new book
she is wearing reading glasses
maybe some labels are best left in the closet
carrie miranda charlotte and samantha back to her fighting weight walk down the busy street dressed for a night on the town
they laugh as they go their designer purses swinging
maybe when we put a label on people
bride groom husband wife fat thin married single
we forget to look past the label and see the person
they arrive at the club entrance
a line of people wait to be let inside
the doorman s spots carrie lifts the red rope and lets the girls in closing it after them
the four girls sit at a table drinking cosmopolitans
this is delicious
why did we ever stop drinking these
because everyone else started
sips then well that is an oldie but goodie
and speaking of an oldie but goodie
a waiter brings birthday cake to the table
the number stands proud and tall among the glowing candles
he places it down in front of a proud samantha
wait wait a toast
the girls lift their glasses to samantha
fifty and fabulous
samantha smiles touched then blows out her candles
and the next fifty
miranda charlotte and samantha raise their glasses
to the next fifty
they sip and look at one another
and there in the same city where they met as girls four new york women entered the next phase of their lives
dressed head to toe in love
samantha licks some icing
charlotte cuts the cake
carrie smiles and sips
and thats the one label that never goes out of style
from outside we catch just a glimpse of carrie and the girls at their table inside the busy club
the camera starts to move away passing the line of people waiting to get in
at the front of the line four twenty something women stand waiting for the red rope to be lifted
as the camera moves past them and up the doorman lifts the red rope and the twenty something women squeal with excitement and anticipation as they hurry inside
the camera continues up and up and over the busy and exciting city
