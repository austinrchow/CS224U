by jonathan lawton stephen metcalfe the view of downtown los angeles from the enormous ornate house is extraordinary
a small outdoor dinner party is in progress
a magician is entertaining guests
playing cards and coins appear and disappear in his nimble hands
edward harris stands at the window impassively looking down at the party
edward is a handsome well groomed man of around forty
he looks tired the kind of fatigue that cant be cured by a nights sleep
a murmur left pocket
and indeed down below the magician pulls the coin from the left pocket of the incredulous womans silk blazer
more laughter and applause
the study is in keeping with the rest of the house
everything the best
william stuckey edwards contemporary is a crafty looking lawyer who is the party host
vance is an investment banker
his assistant jake is a financial researcher
the other men are investment bankers
they are in dark suits and power ties
on the table are stacks of documents and folders the name kross industries is prominent on many of the folders
our banks certainly doesnt want to discourage harris enterprises from investing in california
we think this is a great new venue for you but youve got to understand the mergers and acquisitions market is changing
with the upswing in inflation we have to make these offerings tempting to offset the risk
look were talking about hard assets and a straight liquidation
we have over a thousand man hours in this deal
losing patience this is a no brainer
theres no risk for you
no one has ever lost money backing mr
but ship building is a new endeavor for you
cuts him off come on
you know were not going to go into ship building
besides youre the ones with the troubled track record not us
bill be reasonable
if youre really going to digest kross industries that quickly eighteen should not be such a problem
besides i dont think theres anywhere else you can go for the money in the time you have
edward turns from the window
he hasnt miss a thing
all eyes are on him
draymen heux has offered me seventy five in the pool at sixteen and a half
i can secure the other half personally
you have until tomorrow morning to make me a better offer
the bankers speechlessly stare at him
the meeting is over gentlemen
he turns away
the bankers look at one another
silence as they exit
when the door closes
stuckey explodes with laughter
did you see the look on their faces
you dont think we pushed too hard
theyll come back
they cant afford not to
edward that bluff was beautiful
maybe i should have made it rhyme
the others stare at him uncertain
the others follow suit
looking at his watch well
weve been at this long enough
edward ushers vance and jake toward the door
gentlemen enjoy the party
the magicians wonderful
vance and jake exit
calling after them watch your left pocket
a butler has entered the room
phone call mr
its miss charles
is she coming out
were about to find out
take care of your guests
stuckey exits the room as edward crosses to the telephone
into phone where are you cynthia
beat i see
pausing getting angry no i dont expect you to be at my beck and call
are you coming or not
edward descends the long curved stairway
he has vance in tow
all business prepare the filing papers
have them ready by the middle of the week
ill tell you when to submit them
the people talking and drinking on the stairway gravitate toward edward
turning on the charm yes
will we see you at the polo matches wednesday
wouldnt miss it
abruptly to vance i want this done fast and easy
no slip ups
i want to be back in new york by saturday
he deftly keeps making his way through the crowd
stuckey is sipping champagne and talking to a beautiful woman in a tight sheath of an evening dress
an elegant woman elizabeth stuckey approaches from behind him
she taps him on the shoulder and he turns startled
millicent uh uh millicent
my wife elizabeth
ignoring her is edward leaving
stuckey looks up to see edward moving quickly toward the door
stuckey abruptly leaves the two woman together to follow edward
edward comes out of the house
jags a limo with waiting driver and two bmws pack the circular driveway behind a black ferrari
the limo driver leaps to attention at the sight of edward
edward stands making an obvious effort to keep his impatience under control
stuckey comes out of the house and down the walk
whats up where you going
give me your car keys will you im going back to my hotel
at least stay for a drink
this partys for you
apologize to elizabeth for me
stuckey gropes uncertainly in his pocket for keys
listen therere some major local talent inside just dying to meet you
as if delighted really
some high class gold digger who speaks french better than i do
turning away no thank you
i just got off the phone with one
cynthias not coming
edward grabs the keys out of stuckeys hand
he crosses to a black ferrari and gets in
let your driver take you
well move the cars
edward starts the car
can you drive a stick
the car lurches forward with a squeal of wheels and promptly stalls
edward give me a break
with a squeal of tires the ferrari bucks out of the driveway and
love this car
is it new
and you dont even know where youre going
edward starts it again and heads uncertainly uphill
stuckey watching throws up his hands
thats the wrong way
the ferrari moving fast through the hollywood hills passes large beautiful homes
edward shifts grinding gears
the ferrari comes to a red light and pulls up next to a dodge colt
the girl in the colt looks at edward and his car admiringly
edward feeling confident now revs the engine
the light turns green
edward immediately stalls the ferrari
the colt leaves him in the dust
he blinks shakes his head as if trying to rid himself of his own tired thoughts
the ferrari comes to the intersection of outpost and franklin stops
edward gets out of the car
he looks at the street signs
he has no idea where he is
he gets back in the car and takes off on franklin heading east
a crumbling old apartment building
dark alley ways deserted parking lot
the ferrari blink and you miss it motors past the building looking very out of place on the street
panning up a building facade of lit windows and metal fire escape
one window in particular
a girl stands there in a short kimono looking down
and then she turns away
a series of shots to see her dressing
vivian turns and stares at herself in a grainy cracked bedroom mirror
she is twenty years old and a prostitute
make up applied to give her a hard older look doesnt quite succeed
shed be innocently beautiful without it
she is wearing tiny shorts a tight tube top thigh high boots
she stares at herself not really liking what she sees
she signs turns off the light and walks out of the bedroom
faded peeling walls
thread bare dirty carpet
vivian locks the apartment door behind her and starts down the dim hallway
a door suddenly opens startling her
an unshaved enormously pot bellied man in a stained t shirt stares at vivian with pig eyes
vivian turns some tough on him
dont give me that
kit gave it to you yesterday cash
kit give me nothin
suddenly uncertain you bullshittin me
of rent i do not bullshit
vivian hurries at a run back down the hallway
by the end of the week or youre otta here
a beat by the way you look very nice tonight
vivian pulls a coffee can off a shelf
she pulls off the top
she tosses the can away starts for the door
she opens it
down the hallway the landlord is standing in front of his open doorway talking to a fat woman
they both glance up
vivian quickly closes the door
she doesnt want to deal with them
vivian comes off the fire escape onto the sidewalk
she hurried away
vivian walks along urgently looking for something
a babbling street type goes by happily talking to himself
he wears an i love hollywood t shirt
vivian passes tourists but doesnt notice them any more than she pays attention to the vagrant she passes further on huddle in a doorway
a long haired kid on a skateboard goes by dropping off little bags to various street types
a barker type stands in front of a photo store urging tourists to come in and take a photo with a cardboard cut out of a movie star
some go in
vivian hurries past a group of rubbernecking japanese tourists
a black prostitute in a mini skirt strolls toward her
a car passes
the driver stares at vivian with interest
she ignores him
the black prostitute approaches the car
hey baby you lookin for a date
the driver looks her over
the black prostitute gets in the car and it drives away
a group of men mostly drug dealers hang out at an all night coffee shop
they whistle and make obscene gestures and sounds as vivian hurries by
she ignores them and goes next door into a falafel stand
half a dozen people sit at dirty tables inside
behind the counter are a man and a woman vietnamese cooks frying food trying to ignore the unsavory crowd camped in the shop
chan you seen kit tonight
no see nothing
you do tell her im looking for her
looking good bay bee
yeah you too dnai
if kit comes in here tell her stay
both of them nod and smile at vivian
skateboard zips by a group
we see a police car parked at the entrance to an alcove
also an ambulance
the bubblegum lights are going
a crowd has gathered
the happy man with the i love hollywood t shirt and a police officer are engaged in tense conversation
they just pulled her out of a dumpster in the back
now talk to me
i tell you man i dont know who she hang with
she have a pimp
cocaine her pimp man
she a strawberry
she be out on these streets day in day out tradin her sorry ass for crack
and now she dead from it
vivian rushes up to join the outskirts of the crowd as the body of a young girl is pulled out of an open dumpster and carried towards the waiting ambulance
for a moment vivian thinks its
no vivian turns grimly away
vivian surveys the dark street
and suddenly sees whos shes looking for
we see a young tough looking man and woman trying on wigs
the storekeeper is a man wearing a dress and wild wig
the girl kit is around is dark haired and thin
the young man carlos has his arm sloppily draped across kits shoulder
they giggle about something both obviously high
kit looks up bleary eyed
vivian is standing in front of her
you spent it on drugs didnt you
carlos you know my roommate viv
lookin good baby
ignoring him did you blow it all kit
is it all gone
carlos had some great rock
beat that was our rent
carlos attempts to put an arm around vivians shoulders
calm down chica
vivian throws him off
what is it you wan baby
i can fix you up
beat it scum bucket
you kiss your mother with that mouth
your frien still owes me
to kit lets go
skateboard appears suddenly blocking vivian and kits path
get out of my face or ill have those cops on your ass in two seconds
carlos glares at her
he looks down toward the lights of the cop cars
one of the policemen looks towards them curiously
vivian waves at the cop
threatening to vivian dont take no dates tonight chica you got one with me
vivian grabs kit by the arm and pulls her across the boulevard
vivian and kit sit at a table sipping tea
vivian is still mad at her
we worked for that money
we were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in get off this street
dont be stupid
vivian looks like she wants to weep
she does neither
she slowly nods
kits sorry she said that
kit contd so i blew our stash
we could make it all back with one good night on the streets
i just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster
i wonder how much she made tonight
dont be mad at me
ill pay you back
i thought you were giving up that drug shit
a beat meanwhile i got some crack left you wanna get high
no lets go to work
then touches her hand im sorry i said your dream was stupid
edwards ferrari turns onto hollywood blvd
finally out of the hollywood hills
vivian and kit are out trying to hustle johns in passing cars
vivian strikes a sexy pose at the bus stop
kit is talking to another prostitute rachel
no no honey
you see these stars on the sidewalk
me and vivian work from don ameche all the way up to roy rogers
this is our office
we got seniority
get off our corner
i was just taking a rest here
besides shes new
points to vivian but im old
go rest up by monty hall or debra paget where you belong
rachel walks off
looks at passing cars looks slow tonight
maybe we should get a pimp
carlos likes you and forget it
we work for it
we keep it
they keep hustling
i cant handle this tonight
im going home
stares at her that crack is burning a hole in your pocket
there isnt even milk in the fridge
the rents due
now come on suddenly hey hey theres a rent
hes not gonna want us
the ferrari goes by and stops
calls out to vivian excuse me
excited dont take less than a hundred
you look hot tonight
and remember dont mouth off
they dont like that
but take it easy on that shit
kit gives vivian a quick hug
youre the greatest
ill wait up for you
and then kit is off moving quickly away
she stares at the ferrari loathing it and all it represents
and then its as if vivian turns a switch
she fluffs her mane of hair throws her shoulders back thrusting her breasts out and sashays towards the car a sexy friendly smile on her face
in the drivers seat of the ferrari edward is looking furious and distracted
vivian leans over the passenger window
hey sugar you lookin for a date
you looking for some company
how do i get to beverly hills
dropping the come on you gonna tell me youre lost
what do i look like a tourguide
edward takes a good look at her
a beat no you look like a hooker
actually im a movie star out for a walk
can you tell me how to get to beverly hills
for five bucks
the price just went up to ten
why dont you just do it out of the kindness of your heart
sit and spin
he pulls out his money clip
vivian suddenly freezes
on the sidewalk up ahead carlos and skateboard
carlos flashes an evil menacing grin
he motions to skateboard they start forward
holding up a bill you have change for a twenty
vivian pulls open the door of the car and jumps in
for twenty ill show you personal
edward stares at her
she smiles sweetly
vivian contd make a u ee
beverly hills is the other way
the ferrari pulls away passing carlos on the sidewalk
as he grinds the gears wincing no
vivian smiles back
mind if i turn on some heat
if you can figure it out be my guest
vivian reaches out turns on the heat
youre obviously mechanical
laughs youre not from l
what motel you staying at
okay what hotel
regent beverly wilshire
i bet you know it
annoyed at his tone yeah i peed in the fountain there once
give me a break
edward glances over amused
it hits him that she really is an attractive girl
whats your name
what do you want it to be
a beat vivian my names vivian
you like being a hooker vivian
so do day jobs
sarcastic day jobs yeah
ive tried them
a beat turn right
the ferrari glides along a seedy west hollywood section of santa monica
must be dangerous
tell me about it
is suffering from a wacko epidemic
and who knows where half the guys i pick up have been
i mean i use condoms
and i get checked out once a month at the free clinic
not only am i better in the sack than an amateur im probably safer
you ought to have that printed up on your business card
a moment if youre making fun of me i dont like it
if i did i didnt mean to
vivian unconsciously bites her fingernails
ugly habit biting your nails
you dont know habits you think this is ugly
but she puts her hands in her lap
she looks out the window
shes safe from carlos
okay pull over
let me out
ive got to get back to work
edward pulls the ferrari to the curb and stops
vivian contd stay on this street and youll hit beverly hills
what do you charge for company vivian
company would cost you
a hundred dollars
for the whole night
for an hour
i never joke about money
neither do i
a moment amused a hundred bucks an hour though
thats pretty stiff
she reaches across the seat
her hand goes in his lap
no but its getting there
vivian how much to put up with me for the entire night
you couldnt afford it
vivian starts to get out of the car
vivians sexy smile comes on
whats your name lover
my name is edward
you got it
edward gets out of the car
vivian looks at him confused
you know how to drive a stick
vivian moves around the car
better believe it
then lets go
its worth just so i dont have to drive
they get in the car
she starts the car revs it
here we go edward
the ferrari peels out fishtails madly and screams up the street
thousands of tiny white lights sparkle along the walls of the regent beverly wilshire hotel
bright flags are illuminated by carefully placed spotlights
the ferrari screams into the driveway and comes to a jarring stop by the front door
edward takes a moment to get his breath
he gestures toward the back
my raincoats in the back
put it on
you may feel more comfortable
this is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour
you mean they dont have hookers
every place has hookers but if this hotel has hookers they dont look like theyre
off the boulevard
as they walk in vivian is tying the trenchcoat
now i took like a hooker in a trenchcoat
she looks up
she stops in her tracks
the lobby is bright and spacious filled with thick carved wood paneling
even at this hour there is a great deal of activity
men in business suits and women in furs and jewels are passing by
vivians face quickly conceals the sudden awe she feels at the sight of all this luxury
vivian matter of factly reaches out and takes edwards arm
so lets go
edward guides them across the lobby
they reach the elevators and go inside
the young elevator operator is dressed in a clean red uniform that seems just a bit too tight
as the elevator doors close he nods toward edward
she sees the operator glancing at her
and step on it
edward and vivian come out of the elevator into a hallway leading to a single doorway with two heavy wood doors
edward pulls out his key and unlocks the doors
with a gentle push the door slide open in unison
edward gestures to vivian to go inside
edward closes the doors behind her
as vivian steps into the room she has the sensation of falling off the top of the building
in front of her is a sunken living room with massive windows revealing the sparkling lights of the city below
for the first time she is speechless
edward closes the door and walks past her down the steps to the living room
edward picks up a phone
vivian checks out the room
into the phone room service
to vivian what do you drink
into the phone send up a bottle of crystal champagne
can i have some chips
into the phone and a bowl of strawberries
vivian makes her way down the steps to the living room
she stares at the view
to vivian impressed
vivian is impressed but shes not going to admit it
i come here all the time
as a matter of fact they do rent this room by the hour
he sits down in a comfortable chair and leans back
vivian looks at him
vivian contd well now that you have me for the night what are you going to do with me
want to know something
i dont quite know
i hadnt planned this
do you plan everything
a small smile always
well the meters running its your money
speaking of which cashll do
takes out his wallet
standing over her he drops three crisp new hundred dollar bills in vivians lap
she picks up the bills stares at them trying not to be impressed
she puts the money in her jacket
she realizes edward is standing over her as if waiting
she leans forward reaches out to unzip his pants
he abruptly turns away
lets talk some more first
in town on business
taking off his jacket uh huh
let me guess youre a
loosening his tie and why do you say that
a small smile i dunno
you have that sharp useless look
edward almost smiles
he sits across from her again
sounds like youve known a lot of lawyers
ive known a lot of everybody
a chime goes off to indicate theres someone at the door
he starts to sit up
vivian motions for him to stay put
i might as well make myself useful
edward sits back down
vivian waltzes up the steps and opens the front door
a waiter comes into the room with a silver cart on it is a bucket of champagne and a covered bowl
where would you like it
where would we like it
where would we like it
herell be fine
the waiter carries it down the steps and sets it in the middle of the living room
he turns and heads back up the stairs and pauses near vivian staring
vivian stares back at him
what are you looking at
the waiter glances away uncomfortably and exits
vivian closes the door behind him
vivian marches back down the stairs
i think he wanted you to tip him
excuse me i didnt think he had change for a hundred
edward crosses to the silver stand
vivian watches with interest as he twirls the champagne bottle in the ice bucket
vivian contd you have a wife
i have both
edward lifts the bottle out
he deftly pops the cork on the bottle without losing a drop of champagne
where are they
they should be
theyre both good at it
edward pours the champagne into a single long stemmed glass and hands one to vivian
edward contd my ex wife lives in london in what used to be my home
my girlfriend is in new york moving out of my apartment even as we speak
he drinks nods approvingly
its a very good year
oooh thank god
edward laughs softly
she sips it
to her surprise really likes it
edward lifts a lid on a silver bowl to reveal a dozen enormous strawberries
try a strawberry
because they bring out the flavor of the champagne
jesus you act like youre seducing some valley girl you picked up in a dance club
the meters running
she slowly eats a strawberry
the juice of it stains her lips
her eyes are like smoke as she takes a sensuous sip of champagne licks away the stain of the strawberry
his eyes havent left her
softly you really are a very beautiful girl
husky voiced just a romantic thats you
her mouth is so wet and inviting
he leans closer
hes about to kiss her
vivian contd not on the lips
she pulls his head down to her breast
edward and vivian on the bed
he is on his back his shoulder and head resting against the headboard
she is astride him hands resting on his chest rocking
in control confident
very much liking the fire shes kindled in his eyes
touching her breasts what do you like
if i want you to turn me on ill pay you three hundred
just lay back and let me drive
smiling vivian reaches behind her touching him
he tries not to groan
shes moving faster now
edward suddenly pulls her violently to him he rolls her over
a heavy spray of water comes down upon edward
he stands there quietly letting it wash over him
he turns off the shower steps out of the stall picks up a towel and dries himself
his expensive clothes are on the floor haphazardly dropped everywhere
vivians clothes as tattered as they are are neatly folded and piled on a chair
the incongruity of it touches edward in a sad way
he looks toward the bed
vivian is fast asleep
her heavy makeup has long since been rubbed off
asleep her wary smart ass attitude is gone
she looks like a sweet gentle girl
he stares at her a moment longer
he turns goes into the living room
vivian opens her eyes
through the open door she sees edward sitting in a living room chair
he is reading contracts
the sun is coming up as hotel employee hoses down the sidewalk in front of the hotel
a woman employee is vacuuming the lobby
she sees something and pauses
she pulls a dead leaf from one of the potted plants
the elevator doors open and a waiter rolls a cart out into the hallway
he takes it to the doors of the penthouse
he rings the bell
the waiter wheels in a table of food coffee champagne and orange juice
edward dressed in suit pants white shirt and suspenders stands in the living room talking into a cordless phone
edward points the waiter to the dining table
into the phone sorry
william stuckey is behind his desk
kross knows were after his company
he wants to talk with you
i dont think you should
the waiter returns
edward signs the bill
the waiter exits
i want to
edward if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the wall street journal
ill see him alone
everyone knows youre my muscle
well make it social
tell kross ill meet him for dinner
tonight if you can arrange it
you shouldnt go alone
he might claim that you tried to black mail him
bill were businessmen not the damn mafia
ill see you in the office
by the way about your car
oh god what
smiling ill bring it back
edward hangs up
he pours a glass of orange juice and takes a sip thinking
something makes him turn
vivian wearing a monogrammed hotel terry robe is standing uncertainly in the bedroom doorway
you didnt wake me
ill be out of here in a minute
would you like some breakfast
shes hungry and the breakfast looks great
only if you do
vivian sits across from him
edward serves them breakfast
did you sleep well
i forgot where i was
she looks at him sharply sees that he means no offense relaxes
whered you go
i took the couch
i had some work to do
hesitating about last night
oooh baby you were the best
i was beside myself
mmm i could tell
i just hope it was worth three hundred bucks
id say you give a good dollar value
they share a small smile
do you ever
i like guys if thats what youre asking
not that i trustm
vivian contd what do you do anyway
i buy companies
he almost smiles
she almost smiles back
the one im buying this week will cost around million
this time vivian is impressed
vivian contd you are major league baby
your mother must be very proud
edward is oddly pleased at her reaction
the closet door is open
edward reaches for a tie
in the closet are about a dozen expensive looking suits shirts shoes etc
she follows him in
so what a ya do with the companies once you buym
fumbling with the tie i sell them
she undoes his knot and starts over
vivian contd at ease let me do that
part of the all night services
by breaking up a companys assets what are assets
vivian cmon i might buy a company some day
assets are anything of value a company owns
sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole
by selling them off i make a profit
sorta like stealing cars and sellingm for parts huh
now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot
whered you learn to do this
sarcastic i fucked the debate team in high school
i had a grampa
he liked ties on sundays
you mind if i take a swim in your bathtub before i hit it
vivian turns and heads toward the bathroom
he follows her into the bathroom
vivian turns on the water in the tub
it fills the tub in a torrential rush
you could hold a pep rally in here
the phone on the marbled bathroom wall suddenly rings
edward reaches for it
into the phone yes
stuckey is walking around his desk
edward its me
kross is all set for tonight
vivian stares curiously at the bidet
listen i gotta say this again i dont like you going alone
she turns it on
the water hits her in the face
stifling a chuckle im a big boy
there are lotions and shampoos and bubblebaths on the edge of the tub
vivian regards them like a kid in a candy shop
let me at least get you a date
keep it social
edward watches as vivian smells some bubble bath
her eyes ask edward if its okay to
edward did you hear me
i know a lot of nice girls
vivian pours the bubblebath into the swirling water
theres something about the look on her face
the way she bites her lower lip
i have one
edward hangs up the phone as vivian curiously turns on the television
the sound blares
she fumbles to turn it down
edward reaches over and turns it off
how much for the week
im in town until saturday
she look at him like he isnt speaking english
do you want to stay here for the week
it takes vivian a moment to respond
itd cost you
five full nights
its got to be enough to really change things
she shoots for the moon again
vivian may i point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only
but you want days too
all right two thousand
and then quickly getting herself back together she flips on the sexy smile
vivian contd sugar you got it
i will treat you like a prince
anything anyway you want
im not just talking about sex
look butthead ill treat you so nice youll never want to let me go okay
three thousand for five days
and vivian i will let you go
edward comes out into the bedroom
vivian quickly follows
they move through the bedroom into the living room
ill be out most of the day
he reaches into his pocket for a money clip
he peels off bills
he hands the cash to vivian
i want you to go out and buy some decent clothes
vivians eyes go wide at the amount of money
nothing too flashy not too sexy
theyre at the front door
yeah you want me to dress like your high class girlfriend
youre wasting your money though
all im gonna do is hang around the hotel
as a matter of fact i may never get out of that bathtub
edward opens the door he starts to exit
he turns back
im taking you out to an important dinner with me tonight
the door closes in her face
from inside what
are you crazy
edward smiles to himself
vivian is stretched out in the hot bubble bath
the tv is on
she clicks the remote control in her hand
she lies back into the soapy water and disappears
she suddenly pops back up laughing
a thought occurs to her
she reaches for the cordless phone
she is about to disconnect when the phone is answered
whereve you been
i was asleep
you woke me
kit listen the guy last night the one in the ferrari im at this hotel the regent beverly wilshire its this absolutely unbelievable place and hes hired me for a
whole week and kit listen hes paying me three thousand bucks
we can get out of the apartment
we can get out of this town

hey you there
whyd he want you
perhaps because vivians been wondering the same thing
he just does
im sorry viv
carlos has been on my back
a beat did you get the money up front like i taught ya
three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes
now listen im gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk

spend it on drugs and ill pull your hair out
im getting dressed now
ill be over
hey kit where do i go for the clothes
good stuff on him
brightening in beverly hills
vivian comes out of the elevator and crosses the lobby
she is back in her hooker clothes
she leaves an envelope at the front desk
thomas the prim middle aged hotel manager steps out from his office
he stares in surprise and displeasure as he sees vivian exit out the front door
vivian doesnt notice the odd stares she gets from two well dressed middle aged women who are just entering
vivian is looking wide eyed and delighted and yes more than a bit overwhelmed
she passes store windows
and more store windows
and still more store windows
each display is more beautiful and expensive than the one before
vivian is also aware that she is getting odd looks
two beautiful dressed girls her own age look at her turn away and giggle
the uniformed guards that stand at attention in front of many of the stores stare at her suspiciously
feeling more and more uncomfortable vivian comes to a posh womans boutique
she hesitates for a moment
vivian is no sooner in the door than she is subject to the disapproving stare of a saleswoman standing behind the counter
cooly may i help you
im just looking thanks
vivian tiptoes through the shop as if it was filled with delicate glass objects
she cautiously examines a dress
the saleswoman quickly comes around the counter and approaches her
are you looking for something in particular
vivian eyes the saleswoman puzzled at her tone
she examines a dress
you have beautiful things
no reply how much is this
i dont think it would fit you
beginning to get the drift i didnt ask if it would fit
i asked how much it was
its very expensive
vivians body tenses as she stares at the saleswoman
what is with you
unblinking excuse me
im going to spend money
i dont think we have anything for you here
youre obviously in the wrong place
vivian is speechless
she turns and stomps toward the door
she stops and spins around staring at the saleswoman
vivian flips her off
she throws the door open and storms outside
the saleswoman calmly strolls back to her counter and returns to her place
vivian comes out onto the street and stands lost
she takes a deep breath trying to control herself
two women in elegant designer outfits stroll by eyeing vivian as if she were a freak
vivian suddenly feels naked
she turns and hurries away
vivian enters the lobby upset nervous and paranoid
she feels an emptiness in her stomach at the sight of all the luxury around her
she hurries toward the elevators
at the front desk mr
thomas once again spots her
he crosses the lobby and deftly cuts her off from the elevator
may i help you miss
vivian stops practically shaking with terror
im just going to my room
youre a guest here
im im with a friend
and who is that
vivians face is filled with confusion
she doesnt know his name
the elevator doors open behind them
she spots the operator
blurting it out he knows me
thomas turns and eyes the operator curiously
the operator looks back at them innocently
with a smooth gesture mr
thomas waves the operator over
do you know this young lady
the operator nods
shes with mr
she apparently joined him last night
thomas waves the operator away
why dont you come with me
well chat for just a moment
he takes vivian gently but firmly by the arm and leads her off
in a richly furnished office mr
thomas places vivian in a comfortable chair and then leans against the edge of his desk
whats your name
things that go on in other hotels dont happen at the regent beverly wilshire
vivian says nothing
thomas contd mr
harris however is a very special customer
and we like to think of our special customers as friends
as a customer we would expect mr
harris to sign in any additional guests
but as a friend were willing to overlook it im assuming youre a
vivian finds herself nodding
thomas contd i thought so
you must be his
naturally when mr
harris leaves i wont see you in this hotel again
vivian bites her lower lip nods
thomas contd good
we understand one another
as a gentle afterthought i would also encourage you to dress in a more appropriate manner
vivians face screws up as she tries hard not to cry
thats what i was trying to do
she cant help it the tears come
vivian pulls out the money edward gave her
she drops it on the desk
its a moist looking wad now
vivian contd i was trying to get some other clothes
they made me feel like shit
she cant go on
thomas politely glances at the money
he unfolds it smoothes it and hands it back to her
he picks up the phone
into the phone womens clothing
beat bridget please
vivian is staring at him
thomas contd bridget hello this is barnard thomas over at the regent beverly wilshire
well thank you thats flattering
id like to ask a favor of you
im going to send someone over
her name is vivian
shes a guest of ours
a very special guest
he glances at vivian
with those simple words hed made her feel better
thomas contd shes from out of town and she needs a little help in dressing
perhaps you could help her out
thank you very much
shell be right over
he sets the phone down and smiles patronizingly at vivian
thomas contd there you are
if you have any other problems come ask for me personally
she smiles mischievously
a sleek corporate helicopter flies over the port
edward vance stuckey and jake walk toward the buildings edge
they look out over the empty shipyard as vance describes it
this is the jewel in krosss crown
we can strip out all the heavy equipment
some of the cranes are very valuable overseas
the japanese are salivating for them
prime industrial property straddling the port of long beach and los angeles
it gives me a hard on
edward points toward one of the edges of the shipyard
whats that long building over there
storage i think
not with those smokestacks its not
let me check
vance pulls out a notebook
the real estate possibilities are endless
most of the yard well just level
i talked to a couple of developers under the table of course and they said you what
i talked to some developers about the land
what kind of an idiot are you
you dont talk about this to anyone
theyre close friends theyd never breathe a word to vance where did you dig this moron up
hes right jake that was an incredibly stupid thing to do
it wont happen again edward
ill pull him off the project immediately
we dont have the time to bring someone new up to speed
not unkindly to jake youve already impressed everyone you need to havent you
it wont happen again mr
vance has found what he was looking for in his notebook
this is interesting
that building is storage now but it used to be a smelting plant
they closed it down after world war i want our lawyers to check into the toxic waste licences on them right away
i want to know if the permits are still valid and what kind of limits are on them
its a long shot but if the permits are still in effect theyre worth a fortune
he turns away
the other follow edward back toward the stairs
what times diner tonight
kross is bringing his son
very bright kid watch yourself with him
whos this girl youre taking
no one you know
the elevator opens and vivian walks out and surveys the room nervously
she walks toward the womens clothing section
bridget a large friendly woman spots her and quickly approaches
you must be vivian
bridget contd lets look at you
she steps back regards vivian with a professional eye
bridget contd where are you from dear
for starts you should know that hot pants are horrid even when you do have the legs to carry them off
what are your plans while youre in town
i might be going out to dinner
youll want a cocktail dress then
you have a beautiful figure
a little too out in the open but simply lovely
do you need shoes
do thigh high leather boots go with a cocktail dress
calling out philip
well need shoes
bridget leads vivian towards the racks of clothes
she pulls out a dress
your uncle will like this
hes not really my uncle
they never are dear
thomas is behind the desk
he looks up
vivian is standing there a happy look on her face
she holds up a garment bag
i got a dress
dryly i rather hoped youd be wearing it
i didnt want to get it messed
i got shoes too
thats all right
im sure theyre quite lovely
they were real nice to me there
they treated me yknow
thomas tries not to wince at the familiarity
youre very welcome miss vivian
she smiles at him
he watches as vivian turns and walks toward the elevator
the provocative way her hips move just naturally attracts the attention of a male passerby
and the white gloved elevator man literally leaps to press the elevator button for vivian who rewards him with a happy smile
the phone is ringing vivian enters
she hurries to pick it up
the phone keeps ringing it has more than one line
vivian frantically punches buttons
vivian contd hello
edward is in a private office
never answer the phone
tsk believe me this will be the last time
did you buy some clothes
i got a dress yeah
i hope its appropriate
its very tasteful
i think youll especially like the zipper in the crotch
silence im joking
lets hope so
youll get some more clothes tomorrow
ill be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty five sharp
no i dont got it
even the farmboys back in georgia come to the door when theyre taking you on a date
this isnt a date
go by yourself then
where you taking me anyway
i think youll approve
ill meet you in the lobby
but only cause youre paying me to
thank you very much
vivian slowly sets the phone down
the phone rings again
vivian very carefully punches the flashing button and picks it up
i thought i told you not to answer the phone
edward hangs up
he smiles to himself
vivian bites her fingernails looking nervous
the doorbell rings
vivian looks up startled
she rises moves to answer it
its the spanish maid
she nods politely at vivian
i come to turn down the bed
i turn down the bed
the maid points to her hotel badge trying to explain
i come to turn down the bed
the maid enters
is there a trick to it
the maid turns down the bedspread
is that all
you just fold back the bedspread
i also place las chocolates on the pillow
oooh i love those
i leave extras miss
consuelo are all rich people so lazy they cant do this on their own
thomas is still behind the desk working when a soft voice startles him
he looks up
vivian still hasnt changed
what is it miss vivian
edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner
ever been there
its a bit beyond my
range shall we say
yeah mine too
is it like yknow normal
i think youll find it normal enough
will i like it
youll like it fine
youre the best
she turns away
just mind which fork you use
vivian turns abruptly back a horrified look on her face
an elegant formal placesetting complete with a myriad of different size forks spoons stacked china plates and crystal glassware
sit across from one another at a fully set table
in fifteen minutes i can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the queen
first as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand
but i always eat like this
either youre european or badly brought up
i vonder vich
giggles actually some of the richest people i know have the worst manners
of course mr
harris being of old money knows his way around a table
all right now pay attention please
what if they serve soup
they will serve salad
but what if they serve soup
then you use your soup spoon
smiles i like steak
picking up the appropriate utensil then you would use your steak spoon
thomas swallows his exasperation
we pull back from their table to reveal the cavernous empty banquets room each table is set and ready for the dinner service
miss vivian maybe ill just order a burger barney that way i can eat with my hands
theres a salon here in the hotel
instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners why dont you just have your hair done instead
vivian sits in a salon chair
the last customer thane a young man of about twenty with his long hair pulled back in a pony tail tilts her head one way and then another eyeing her
i have a friend who has a friend who does chers wigs
i hate him already
a beat all set
what a ya say we chop it all off and bleach the tips
edward enters and looks around the lobby
edward crosses to a house phone and picks it up
hes about to dial when good evening mr
edward looks at him blankly
barnard thomas manager of the hotel
of course yes
if youll excuse me just a moment i have a message for you from your niece sir
the young lady staying in your room
edwards eyes narrow
he hangs up the phone
i think we both know shes not my niece
thomas looks uncomfortable
edward contd does this hotel have any problem with that
harris a guest of yours is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly
the young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge
he starts towards the lounge
very intriguing young woman miss vivian
his tone stops edward in his tracks
thomas contd have a good evening sir
and off he goes leaving edward to wonder what the hell transpired during the afternoon
edward enters the lounge
he looks around not seeing vivian
and suddenly his eyes go back to
the beautiful girl with the beautifully styled hair in the beautiful black cocktail dress at the piano bar
edward tries to hide his surprise as vivian rises moves elegantly towards him
such a beautiful woman deserves an apology and so without thinking im sorry
she waits expectantly
he holds out an arm
she takes it
vivian comes out of the ladies room
she walks forward past the maitreds station
she takes a breath
and then walks forward
vivian moves down a marble starircase through the elegant restaurant toward a far table
her beauty and natural grace draw approving stares
she is like a queen moving through a ballroom
at a secluded table edward sits in conversation with two men
james kross in his early s a bulky self made millionaire industrialist
sitting next to him is his son and second in command david kross a handsome man in his early thirties
all of them rise as vivian comes to the table
david kross holds out vivians chair for her
surprised she nods her thanks
in front of her is an enormous placesetting
she smiles down at the utensils filled with confidence
waiters have placed a delicate salad down in front of each of them
vivian proudly reaches for her salad fork
but then she sees that kross has picked up the fork closest to his plate and is digging into his salad with that
vivian looks to see what edward will do
he doesnt seem interested in eating yet
neither does david kross
feeling a sudden panic vivian puts her fork down
so young man i understand you are trying to take over my company
the abruptness of the question takes edward back for a moment
but then he almost smiles
please dont patronize me mr
our ages mean nothing here
kross and david look at each other
harris we know youve purchased at least twenty percent of our stock
we also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share
twenty five percent
harris i built kross enterprises myself
i know every man who ever worked there by his first name
i know their wives
and their children
if your intention is to take over my company and turn it into a glorified real estate deal think again
edward thankfully now reaches for his salad fork and begins to eat
relieved vivian picks up hers
they all eat for a moment
what do you suggest mr
waiters approach some to clear the salad plates some to put down the next course
vivian thinking shes got to finish quickly stuffs her mouth with the rest of her salad
she is reluctant to let the waiter take her fork
what would it take to buy our stock back
name your price
to get me in a mood to sell double what i paid
but your company doesnt have enough capital right now to buy anything
were on the verge of closing a large navy contract
double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares
we would give you a promissory note
youre not getting any navy contracts
vivian can see that both father and son are stunned by this news
theres no way you could know that
but i do know
i also know your lines of credit are over extended
if i dont buy your company someone else will
looking up ah the escargot
escargot are put down in front of everyone
vivian stares at them dubiously
she picks up what she assumes is the next right fork
she picks up a snail
the two do not fit
flustered she doesnt know what to do
no one else seems to be eating
and now a waiter comes and places escargot forks at each place
vivian picks it up with a sigh of relief
softly to the waiter scume me what are these things
bending to whisper escargot mademoiselle
leaning close to whisper snails
vivian stares at them horrified
she like james and david kross no longer seem interested in eating
edward eats with pleasure
kross im not here to sell you my stock
on the contrary im here to buy yours
angry youve got a lot of nerve
what i have is a lot of money
i know all about you mr
when you buy companies they have a way of disappearing
even the pension funds are stripped clean
the last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces widows were left without their retirement checks
calmly what i did with those companies was perfectly legal
i dont question the legality of what you do
its your morality that makes me sick
i will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you
angry now it is not your company
its a public company
and i am going to acquire it
either i buy from the other stock holders or i buy from you
vivian struggles with her escargot
edward contd i would suggest that you and your board cooperate with me rather than fight a battle you dont have the ammunition to win
vivian suddenly zings her snail across the table
everyone looks to her
slippery little suckers
if youll excuse me young lady mr
turns to david deal with this david you know where we stand
i need to go someplace and puke
to edward and vivian men like my father built this country
he was no saint
he screwed people
but for every guy he stepped on he gave a hundred a good job
edward is silent
he seems like a nice man
david looks at vivian as if seeing her for the first time
we can reach an understanding on this
i dont think so
you should know were going to fight you with every resource we have
do what you have to do
i dont take it personally
i take it all very personally
to vivian very nice meeting you vivian
david kross gets up and leaves
vivian and edward sit in silence
a beat and thats the way the game is played
screwin some poor slob out of his retirement
edward says nothing
but vivian can see shes hit a nerve
snails for dinner
no wonder everybody is in such a bad mood
a waiter appears at the table
are we ready for the next course sir
bring a check please
edwards face is pensive and thoughtful as he stares out of the glass window down at the city lights
he quickly drains his champagne glass
vivian moves to stand next to him
she refills his glass from the bottle
youre upset huh
i never get upset about business
you liked the guy though
whether i liked him or not is irrelevant
theres no emotion involved in business
if you want to survive
excited were the exactly the same
kit keeps telling me dont get emotional when you turn tricks thats why no kissing its too personal
the key is like youre saying stay numb dont get involved when im with a guy im a robot i just do it
realizing what shes saying and quickly recovers except with you
at your price i give my all
vivian contd lets not talks about this heavy stuff
come on relax
vivian comes up behind him
she begins to rub his shoulders
is very good
edward is silent
turns him unknots his tie unbuttons his collar
know what were gonna do in a little while then
were gonna call dominos and havem deliver a bigass pizza
were gonna eat it in bed
were gonna veg out and watch television
yeah its this box it has pictures sound
you dont have to use your brain at all
i have work to do
smiling she softly kisses his throat
vivian contd see
what you havent figured out yet
she kissed his neck
she fumbles with his belt
vivian contd is that while youre the boss everyplace else
im the one in charge here
she kisses his chest
vivian contd you
just think you are
she starts to kneel down
he stops her
they stare at one another for a moment
he releases her
she starts to undress him
vivian is asleep
she turns over slowly waking
her hand goes out to touch edward and encounters nothing but empty bed
vivian comes awake with a sudden start
she look around momentarily frightened not sure where she is
sighing with relief she lies back down
she sees edwards american express card on the pillow next to her
wake up vivian
time to shop
edward comes out of the bathroom and moves toward the bed
he is tying his tie
vivian sits up and ties it for him
he smiles at her
i still dont understand why you only bought one dress
i wasnt as much fun as i thought it was going to be
well you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you
was someone rude to you
i had a little problem in one store
i wasnt dressed right
i dont know what to say
i dont belong there
maybe ill just go back to bridget
she was cool
vivian you belong wherever you are
i dont care how you were dressed they were the ones who were wrong not you
edward sits on the bed
edward contd people arent going to respect you unless you respect yourself
a beat the next time someone is rude to you you stare at them right here
he softly touches her right between the eyes
edward contd its an old trick i use especially with bankers
works every time
will you try it
a beat come with me
edward looks at his watch
vivian covers it with her hand
a beautiful chic womens shop
the haughty salesgirl approaches vivian near a rack of dresses
edward hovers in the b
can you help me
the salesgirl looks vivian up and down
vivian gives her the stare and straightens up
we see the salesgirls reaction change
confidently im looking for a dress nothing too flashy not too sexy conservative
in a size six
uncomfortable under vivians stare do
do you have a charge account with us
vivian smiles and draws out edwards american express card
the salesgirl nods and quickly moves to a rack of dresses to find vivians size
vivian tries on different clothes under edward and the salesgirls supervision
vivian comes happily out of the dressing room wearing a low cut spangled and fringed outfit
edward shakes his hand
the salesgirl holds a classic tweed ensemble over vivians outfit
sighing i look like fucking nancy reagan
the salesgirl shows edward clothes by ann taylor
he turns to find vivian happily holding up a tiny low cut leather dress
edward shakes his head in mock disapproval
vivian is wearing an elegant pastel dress
edward is standing at the stores bar watching and talking on the telephone
stuckey and vance are pouring over stock reports talking to edward on the speaker phone
kross came out of his corner swinging
he started buying up all available stock as soon as the market opened
almost to himself hes a tough old son of a bitch
edward is watching vivian
she pulls the hem of her skirt up to mid thigh
she looks hopefully over to edward
edward shakes his head
its up to ten and a quarter
offer nine and a half
bring them back down to earth
where is he getting the money to fight
someones loaning it to him
get on it right away
our contract guys are working on the kross pension funds
theres another forty million there
we can bleedm dry
there is a sudden hesitation in edwards eyes
he watches as vivian tries on a hat
she preens for him
to vance stuckey put the pension funds on hold until i say otherwise
surprised were letting them slide
i want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now
edward hangs up and takes a long look at vivian
she moves to him
looks at his watch youre on your own now vivian
ive got to get to work
be sensible and you can keep everything
spend too much and it all goes back
vivian hugs him again
vivian walks along rodeo drive
she looks lovely in the pink dress and new white shoes
a pretty white hat is the final touch
she carries a bag containing her old clothes
she stops at a trashcan and ceremonially throws the offending items away
we sees vivian in each department within the store with different salespeople
she happily and confidently tries on a variety of dresses hats shoes accesarries etc
vivian is in a dressing stall
she tosses a dress out to a waiting saleswoman
a saleswoman holds a long purple evening gown
imitating bridget horrid
vivian is admiring a pair of beautiful suede dress pumps
her attention is drawn to the salesmens exotic hand painted tie
whered you get your tie
vivian stands in front of an enormous tie rack with the salesman a dozen wild swirling designed ties are hanging over his outstretched arm
vivian picks out the brightest one and smiles
vivians arms are filled with clothing boxes and bags
she feels like she owns the block
a well dressed man passes by smiling politely
vivians nose lifts as she happily ignores him
suddenly vivian stops
shes about to pass the shop she was thrown out of
vivian takes a breath and enters the shop
the moment she steps through the door vivians courage leaves her
the saleswoman is waiting on a customer
to the customer isnt this lovely
i think it would look wonderful on you
vivian musters her courage
she takes a deep breath and starts forward
to her customer would you like to try it on
both the saleswoman and her customer look up
the saleswoman smiles pleasantly
do you remember me
no im sorry i dont
i was in here yesterday
vivian slowly raises her middle finger
the recognition starts to dawn in the saleswomans eyes
vivians courage begins to return
i want you to know something
you made me feel terrible
i wasnt dressed right and you said i didnt belong here
well i do
youre the one that was wrong not me
and i want to tell you something else
im never gonna shop here again as long as i live
and with that vivian turns and walks out
the saleswoman is stunned
the customer thrusts the dress into the saleswomans arm as if offended by vivians speech and leaves the store also
thomas looks up from the desk
vivian and a bellhop stroll through the hotel entrance and across the hotel lobby to the elevator
the bellhops arms are packed with boxes and shopping bags
thomas cant help it
he smiles to himself
vivian opens the front door for the bellhop who carries in her packages
she motions for him to place them on the couch
vivian happily tips him with a five dollar bill
the door closes
vivian does a giddy spin and falls onto the couch
edward is standing at the end of a long meeting table
he is serving himself coffee from a tray
gloating you were right
kross mortgaged everything he has down to his grandsons college tuition to secure loans from a bank
not just any bank
one we do business with
edward just sips his coffee
stuckey contd it goes without saying that your business means a great deal more to them than our friend krosss
a beat all you have to do is make a call
edward is silent
stuckey is again surprised
excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week
first you go soft on the pension funds
now youre giving him the chance to get away
as of two minutes ago you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars come on bill dont talk to me about how much moneys involved
its my money
and some of its mine
edward his jugulars exposed
then get the bank on the phone for me
he closes the door
a beautiful candlelit food laden table has been set up in the middle of the room
champagne and wine chills in a bucket
a fire burns in the fireplace
music is playing
and stares again
vivian stands in the bedroom doorway
she is wearing an exquisite silk dressing gown
she looks incredibly beautiful
i thought maybe youd like dinner
he fingers her dressing gown nice
wait till you see what i have on underneath
she opens the dressing gown
what she has on underneath is absolutely nothing
edward crosses to her
taking her in his arms he lifts her up and kisses her breasts
what about dinner
dinner can wait
the bathroom is lit by candles
vivian and edward are in the marble tub
vivian sits behind edward
she lazily washes his shoulders and back with a large sponge
you always been rich
seems like it
i guess its easy to get used to huh
easier than learning how to be poor
a moment and then my fathers family was wealthy
when i was young there were cars and houses private schools nannies
but then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman
and he took his money with him
i like hearin
not much to tell
i went to public school
went to university on scholarship
went to work for an investment firm
in eight years i owned it
and then growing very quiet my father was chairman of the board of the third company i ever went after
i swallowed that company and shit out the pieces
one of the pieces was him
vivian softly traces small patterns on edwards shoulders with a finger
you still mad atm
he died a long time ago
she gently rests her head on his back
panning bellies people are sunbathing by the pool
old and stretch marked
and then gorgeous
the gorgeous is vivian
she is wearing a miniscule bikini and sunglasses
she looks up
a young waiter looking a little dry mouthed at the sight of her is holding a telephone
you have a call
taking the phone hi baby
a moment ill be ready
she hangs up
she looks at the waiter confused
what do you wear to polo
horses and riders crash and careen on the playing field
an enthusiastic crowd cheers
a tailgate party using cadillacs and rolls royces is in progress
horses and riders thunder by a crowd of very well dressed successful looking people celebrities execs socialites aficionados most of whom ignore the game
they are there to see and be seen much more than to watch a polo match
vivian and edward make their way towards the party
edward is wearing his new tie
vivian is looking very chic and beautiful in one of her new outfits
not that its helping the place the people the wealth everything here suddenly has her overwhelmed
she suddenly stops
youre really pushing it bringing me here
i think its exciting
what id we run into someone i know
i really doubt anyone here frequents hollywood boulevard
a voice calls out
william stuckey is with a group of people
he waves them over
stuckey contd come on
edward takes vivians arm and leads her forward
stuckey grins and shakes edwards hand
looking at vivian well well well
vivian dislikes this guy on sight
dislikes the frosty looking woman at his side
bill id like you to meet vivian
holding out a hand smiling bill stuckey vivian
my wife elizabeth
elizabeth stuckey stretches her thin lips in a cold smile
lots of fun people here
let me get you two some champagne
he moves quickly away
she moves to greet someone else
vivian and edward survey the milling crowd
sarcastic real genuine guy
hes good at what he does
you could freeze ice on his wifes ass
she anything like your ex
a small smile shall we mingle
a goal is scored
edward watches and guides her vivian sips champagne and meets and chats and wins over different people
a group of people
i simply love your dress vivian
this old thing
of course a figure like yours can wear anything
you must work out constantly
i lead a very physical life
are you into running vivian
im into walking
i walk a lot
in another group of people
you look awfully familiar vivian
havent we run into one another at the spa in la costa
well i do often spa there
edward and elizabeth stuckey watch vivian laugh and chat with a group of women
edward shes marvelous
warm and witty and down to earth
with pleasure she is isnt she
so unlike your usuals
where on earth did you find her
edward smiles enigmatically
taking an hors doeuvres off a passing waiterss tray he starts forward
were good together
he has to admit it
ive been just what he wants me to be
i say the right things i know the right people i give wonderful parties
no question no arguments no embarrassments
it works for both of us
that makes vivian think
and then she smiles as she sees edward approaching
vivian moves to him
edward these women here i dont think any ofm like the guys theyre with
theyre just into it for the money
im sure thats true for some of them
i thought i was the pro
these women make me feel like an amateur
a beat ready to stomp sod
the crowd engages in sod stomping
they drink champagne
they make a dance out of it
shoes get stuck in the mud
its ludicrous these people in their suits and fancy clothes replacing divots and stepping over the horse shit
in a corner of the field grazing horses stare seemingly in disbelief
vivian is having a wonderful time
and then as she moves towards the outside of the crowd she sees someone staring at her from over among some of the riders and grazing horses
david kross smiles at vivian
and then she crosses towards him
i never thought stomping in grass could be so much fun
laughs i like your hat
pleased a moment uhm
business things going
lets not talk about it its too depressing
come on ill show you thunder
please we hardly know each other
thunders a horse
they approach the sweating mount
david kross caresses the horses muzzle
hey big guy you getting tired yet
this is vivian
a beat and then you two been together long
you and edward
hope to be
to vivians surprise the question causes a pang inside
its not like that
maybe that means youd have lunch with me sometime then
vivian is suddenly silent
she looks away
david contd im sorry am i being too forward
you dont know anything about me
id like to find out
you dont know anything about me either
thats why people have lunch
but something holds vivian back a feeling
william stuckey turns
he sees vivian and david kross standing together
he stares his mind racing and anxious angry look on his face
stuckey has edward off to the side
he is talking to him in a low earnest voice
fill me in on this
howd you and vivian meet
we just did
grinning come on you can tell me
i sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this
the night i left your house i was lost
i was looking for directions
and you just happened to run into her
whats she do
vivians in sales
what does she sell
edwards eyes narrow
why do you want to know
hear me out
ive known you a long time
i see a difference in you this week
like that tie
im suddenly wondering if this girls not the difference
especially when i see her talking with david kross
vivian turns away from the bar now holding two glasses of champagne
she scans the crowd for edward
she met him at dinner last night
i like this tie
so now theyre best friends
edward this girl appears out of nowhere and now i see her talking to a guy whose company were trying to buy
its too convenient
youre being ridiculous
industrial espionage is not ridiculous
edward how do you know she hasnt attached herself to you so she can bring kross back information
christ bill shes not a spy shes a hooker
i picked her up off hollywood boulevard
as she hear loud sudden laughter
she sees that its stuckey laughing
smiling vivian starts towards them with two glasses of champagne
i swear to god you are the only millionaire i ever heard of whod go looking for a goddam bargain streetwalker
edward sees vivian coming
lets drop it shall we
he smiles gently as vivian quietly approaches and hands him his glass of champagne
a group of businessmen are standing a short distance away
one of them calls out edward
may we have your opinion on something
to vivian and stuckey excuse me a moment
he moves to join the group of men
stuckey gives vivian a broad smile
having a good time vivian
all this must be quite a change from hollywood boulevard
vivian looks as if shes been struck
edward told me
your secrets safe with me
stuckey runs his hand up her arm
stuckey contd what do you charge vivian
maybe you and i could get together after edward leaves
forcing a bitter smile yeah
call me at the regent beverly wilshire
i just might do that
he moves away
edward looks up from his conversation sees her looking at him
he smiles raises his glass in a small toast
vivian toasts him back
edward switches on a light
vivian comes down the steps into the room
edward follows after her
youre awfully quiet
you havent said a word since the party
as edward touches her shoulder vivian suddenly spins and explodes with anger
i cant believe what a
vivian what the tears well in vivians eyes as she yells at him
clean the slut up take her out huh
what are you trying to prove
im not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends
i dont know what youre talking about
ive been with stinking old men whove made me want to puke but ive never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight
would you please calm down
tell me what happened
he wants an appointment with me after you leave
you my pimp now or did he think that up on his own
edward looks guiltily away
what was i supposed to do
a beat i told the truth
why should the truth upset you
its not as if youre from a convent
i want my fucking money
im getting out of here
i dont want anything more to do with you
can we talk about this
can you just try to calm down
your goddamned friend he thinks the only reason im with you is for the money
a tear falls from vivians eyes
defiantly well its true
just pay me what you owe me and im gone
before i pick up this chair and smash your face in
im only here a couple of more days and im not going to spend them fighting with you
ill call you a cab
if you want the clothes pack them up
vivian stands quietly for a moment
and then she turns and walks into the bedroom
vivian starts roughly picking up her clothes in the dim light of the bedroom
as she does she starts crying
with each item of clothing the tears come down harder
edward appears at the doorway
his face is genuinely concerned
i wasnt prepared for questions about us
it was an idiotic and insensitive thing i did
i should have known that it would hurt you
im not hurt
it doesnt hurt you when somebody pisses on you it just pissed you off
i really am sorry
vivian lets the clothes fall from her arms
sobbing she stands limply
you hurt me
edward goes to her and wraps his arms around her shoulders
she touches his hand
he sits on the bed
he pulls her to him and wraps his arms around her holds her tight
ill make it up to you
edward carrying a briefcase moves jauntily down a long hallway
stuckey trails after him
this is no time to disappear
were in too far
kross isnt going anywhere and i dont need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down
ill be in the office tomorrow
promise me youll read those contracts by then
he calls after edward
by tomorrow edward
edward hurries on
edward exits out of his limo and walks to the front doors
edward smiles moving jauntily to the elevators
thomas at the front desk notices edwards happy mood
good afternoon mr
edwards attention is taken by the glittering jewelry display in the hotel jewelry store window
he detours from the elevators and moves to the window for a closer look
he thinks a moment and enters the jewelry store
vivian comes out of the bedroom into the living room wearing an elegant red sequined evening dress
she looks incredibly beautiful
she sees the phone
a thought occurs to her and going to it she picks it up
she hears someone at the door
she hangs up
he is carrying a small case
he stops at the sight of vivian
do i look okay
a small smile hmm
no theres something missing
he holds up the small case
i dont want you to get too excited
these are on loan
vivians jaw drops
edward is holding a diamond and ruby necklace in his hands holds it as if it might melt if he breathed too hard
edward behind vivian fastens the necklace around her neck
this is made for a princess
i think shed approve of you wearing it tonight
he leads her to a mirror
she stares at her reflection
edward i cant
of course you can
what if i lose it
what if someone tries to steal it
ill guard them and you with my life
a limo pulls onto the tarmac at burbank airport
a pilot in a leather jacket and sunglasses hurries forward to open the limo door
edward now wearing evening clothes and vivian climbs out of the limo
your plane is ready to go mr
taking her arm edward leads her across the tarmac
you dont want to go all the way to san francisco in a limousine do you
where are you taking me
to meet some friends
rudolpho a poet
benoit a landlord
mimi a flower maker
up ahead is a waiting private jet its engines already humming
she is speechless
edward grins loving the look on her face
the corporate jet takes off down the landing strip
edward and vivian are alone in the passenger lounge of the jet
vivian cant believe the cabin
it is a comfortable room featuring a long couch that curves across two walls built in bar television and stereo
edward is once again going over papers
ive never been on a plane before
im glad you like it
now be quiet ive really got to read these
vivian fluffs her hair up
she makes a happy excited growling sound rrrrr
a wicked gleam comes to her eye
she walks over to edward and stands in front of him
he looks up
she parts the thigh high slit in her gown to expose silken quarters
she begins to unfasten the garters one at a time
vivian what do you think youre doing
edward watches silk stockings slide down vivians lovely legs
she reaches out and gently caresses edwards face
edward sets down his papers
the setting sun casts an incredibly glow over the city and the coast
you ever been in love with anyone
vivian is at the window looking out
she carefully puts her earrings back on
she stares mesmerized by the skyline the golden gate bridge in the distance
edward is buttoning his shirt
he is silent
youre not paying me to ask you question like that
im paying you to be you
a beat have you
ever been in love with anyone
you mean besides elvis
turning back to the window im a human being
first time i ever ran away from home i got as far as atlanta
i met this boy
hed been with his parents on their way to chicago
they stopped at a gas station
he went to the john
when he came back theyd split
we sorta started looking out for each other
aw he was sweet
and boy was he good looking yknow dark hair and eyes
the chicken hawks were on him all the time
he hated that
sometimes wed find a safe place to crash nights and wed curl up together and wed talk about all these crazy things
the two of us getting married someday
what happened to him
my father found me
dragged me home
i dont know why he never seemed to like me much when i was there
a bitter smile cept when he was drunk then he liked me a whole lot
a moment i made it back to atlanta a year later
andy was gone
vivian stares out the window
aw but things sure look fine when youre sitting way up high
edward moves close to vivian and putting an arm around her shoulders stares with her out at the view
vivian rests her head against him
an airport limo pulls to a stop in front of the san francisco opera house
the driver walks around back and opens the passenger door
edward emerges and helps vivian out
edward puts his hand on vivians elbow as they walk through the elegant lobby
some people say that opera is an acquired taste but i dont believe it
you can always tell when someone goes to the opera for the first time
they either love it or hate it
those who love it will always love it those who hate it might come to appreciate it but theyll never truly love it
vivian is wide eyed as they walk past a beautifully lit fountain with several graceful statues in its center
everywhere she looks she sees elegantly dressed women and prosperous looking men
it makes her nervous
without realizing it she raises a protective hand up to her necklace
she looks as if she suspects someone is going to step up and steal it
i really doubt if anyone here is going to try and grab it
vivian reluctantly lowers her hands
a crowd of people mill around the lobby heading toward their seats
vivian is aware of the looks she draws as she passes curious even envious looks from the women appreciative glances from the men
her hands again rises nervously to her necklace
they all think you look very beautiful vivian
vivian gives him a grateful look
relaxing she lowers her hand from the necklace
with a flourish he offers his arm
she takes it
they start forward
edward and vivian take their seats in a box high above the stage
if its in italian how will i know what theyre saying
ill whisper some of the main parts of the story to you
but youll be surprised how much you understand
the music conveys the story more powerfully than any words
but dont they have it in english
vivian dont be afraid of what you dont know
thats the fun of it
the lights dim
even if i hate it im glad you brought me
the orchestra begins to play
vivians eyes focus intensely on the stage as if a new world is about to be revealed to her
in a montage of images and music la boheme is performed
the lights from the stage dance across vivians face
edward leans over to translate the tenors aria
what am i
i am a poet
not a man of wealth but one rich in dreams
you have come to replace my vanished dreams
i dwell now only in your eyes
the music ebbs and swells
the sets and costumes change
the story continues
edward again leans close to vivian
and now she asks rudolpho if he still thinks her beautiful vivian raises a hand and gently covers edwards mouth
her eyes are fixed on the stage
she doesnt need his help
the emotions building inside vivian swell as the music is reaching its tragic climax
her lips tremble
her eyes fill with tears
edward glances at her
he studies her a long moment watching the emotions play unashamedly across her face
strangely moved he takes vivians hand
as the opera ends they are both swept away by it
as the lights come up vivian wipes off her tear ruined mascara
she sighs happy
the women in the next box smile at her
did you enjoy the opera dear
tearfully it was so beautiful i just about pissed my pants
edward smiles at the now shocked looking older woman and he and the still misty vivian exit
edward and vivian sit side by side
if youd gone on about how much you liked it im not sure id have believed you
i more than liked it
ive never enjoyed it more
vivian looks at him a moment
and then leaning slowly forward she kisses him gently on the mouth
he looks at her surprise
he puts his arms around her and kisses her back
it is the first time theyve kissed and they make it very special
the plane flies in the night
back to l
in a series of cross fades edward and vivian make love
equally giving equally taking
no masks no shields
in the darkened bedroom edward and vivian lie together
edward cradles vivian
her back rests against his chest
his arm is over her body
she takes edwards hand in her hands and carefully examines it marveling at the fingers the tiny hairs on the back
she gently kisses the palm
she clutches edwards hand tightly to her breast
she closes her eyes ready to sleep now
his eyes open
vivians whispered endearment has filled with him with sudden confusion and uncertainty
he stares into the dark wondering what to do with the woman in his arms
the phone rings
edward immediately reaches out and picks it up
he is dressed in a robe
breakfast is on the umbrellad table in front of him
stuckey not even dressed yet paces around his desk
did i wake you
i had to call
i jus got off the phone with james kross
he wants to see you
he wouldnt say
i think we got him
his nuts are on the block and we got him
silence you there
give me twenty minutes
well be there
listen if hes really caving in well go from there down to the office
i want him to commit his stock to us this morning
edward hangs up
his mind seems on other things
vivian is still asleep
she is face down on the bed the sheets just covering her to her waist
edward stares down at her
he gently reaches out and runs a finger down the soft line of her spine
vivian murmurs contentedly
opening her eyes looking at him hi
edward smiles at her softly
and then better get dressed
were having guests
vivian is wearing her yellow dress
she stares at herself in the bedroom mirror
her make up
she realizes how different she is now realizes that she likes it
edward comes out of the bathroom
he crosses to the closet for a tie
she comes over starts to tie his tie for him
he is very aware of the closeness of her
she smiles at him
he smiles puts his hand on her stopping her for a moment
looking up she sees that he is serious now no more jokes
he releases her hand
quietly one more night and youre finally rid of me
yeah youve been pretty tough to take
i have to go to new york tomorrow
vivian says nothing
edward contd but ill be back in los angeles
id like to see you again
i thought we could work out something
vivian is silent
edward contd ill get you an apartment buy you a car vivian sighs letting something go inside
finished with his tie she turns away
edward contd what is it
not unkindly what else
you gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town
it wouldnt be like that
i want to get you off the street
youll have a different kind of life
whats wrong with that
thats very sweet edward and i know you mean it
she is silent
vivian ive thought about this a lot
this is the best solution
shakes her head no then continues tying his tie when i was a little girl my mother locked me in the attic when i was bad which was pretty often
id stare out the window up there and make believe i was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen
then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up
rescue me from the tower and then wed ride off
but never ever in all the times i had that dream did the knight say come on baby ill put you up in a great condo
she finished his tie
vivian lifes not a fairy tale
softly to herself i know
a beat hey dont mind me
im being stupid
more ill think about it okay
its a real good offer for a whore
ive never treated you like a whore
not mean you just did
the doorbell suddenly rings in the living room
edward enters the living room
vivian slowly enters behind him
edward opens the front door
kross slowly enters
he looks very old and tired so much so that edward has to mask his surprise
how are you mr
not bad for a man who hasnt slept in four nights
ill get used to it
an angry reluctant looking david kross is behind his father
stuckey brings up the rear
edward and david give one another perfunctory nod
stuckey smugly winks at edward
edward closes the door and leads them all down the stairs
vivian is very troubled at krosss appearance
he gently nods at vivian
to david hi
lets not waste time here shall we
kross you said this morning you wished to speak with mr
harris is now listening
kross has to fight down his humiliation at stuckeys tone
he turns to edward
im here to tell you that ive reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer
of course yes
after the expected filing period is over im going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid
a moment youre making the right decision sir
stuckey glances triumphantly at edward
he is surprised to see that there doesnt seem to be any victory in edwards face
edward is silent
kross interprets his silence as second thoughts
ill see you on one condition
im not so concerned for me but the people who have worked for me
vivian is disturbed watching this tired looking man
quickly theyll be taken care of
wont they edward
kross ignores stuckey
he looks to edward
edward slowly nods
ill sign anything you want then
kross nods tiredly
his voice is very soft
vivian abruptly turns and disappears into the bedroom obviously upset
the men all watch her go
he turns to kross excuse me please
he heads to the bedroom
vivian is sitting on the bed on the phone
is kit deluca there
when she comes in will you have her call vivian wells at
she hangs up as edward comes in
what did you do to him
what do you mean
last time i saw him he was this strong guy
now hes beaten
and you liked him
vivian i want you to listen to me
the man realized that it would be better for his future and his sons future if he cooperated
its not your concern
business thats all
the man made a business decision
its all just business to you
its what i do for a living
its how i make money
ill be back in a few hours
well talk about this later
edward enters the living room
the men look at him expectantly
well continue this down at the office
he heads for the door
vivian stands at the railing unhappily looking out at the city beyond
the phone rings
she turns and hurries inside
vivian answers the phone
thomas is standing behind the front desk a rather strained expression on his face
barnard thomas here
miss vivian i wonder if you might come down to the front desk
theres someone here to see you
id send them up but sadly i dont trust the young lady to find you on her own
a hand reaches out and wrenches the phone away from mr
kit heavy make up skimpy outfit chewing gum cigarette and all keeps her voice just below a bellow
where are you babe
glaring at mr
thomas the sphincter police wont let me through
kit finishes slurping on a big frosty ice cream soda
she smacks her lips like a happy little girl
vivian isnt having anything
yes im glad youre clean but ive been calling and calling
was that you
who did you think
i still owe him two hundred bucks
kit i left that money for you days ago
i just got it
an older couple walk past the table
they stare at kit
fifty bucks grampa
for seventy five the wife can watch
horrified the elderly couple hurry away
everybody keeps starin at me
i know what you mean
what do you know
you look good
all dressed up
meaning it you clean up real nice
giggling you sure dont fit in down on the boulevard lookin like you do
not that you ever did anyway
you think i fit here where they just about chew your food for you
where do you fit
vivian is silent then
suddenly i kissed him kit
on the mouth
honey youre not supposed to do that
i stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real
oh my god you mean it was good
miserably it was great
he wants to set me up in a place give me some money
i pray for that
nods all im doing is feeling lousy about it
i dont know what to do
what do i do kit
go for the bucks
i dont care about bucks
a beat i might love this guy
wow are you in deep shit
a sigh you know hell break your heart
vivian is silent again
kit contd i blame myself here
first time i laid eyes on ya i knew you were too complicated to be a whore
her face is filled with confusion
edward stands at the window looking out
there is something about his somber demeanor that both reflects the look weve just seen on vivian and suggests the way we saw him at the top of the story
jake enters a pile of papers under his arm
he begins laying them out on the conference table
kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker
edward says nothing
who are you going after next sir
he turns as stuckey james and david kross and vance enter the room
they surround a conference table
kross sits the papers laid out in front of him
stuckey hands kross a pen
a secretary lays out finger food
they wait for her to leave before they speak
if we can get these letters of intent out of the way now
harris and i would like to ask you some questions about your company
dad excuse me but thats inappropriate
youre under no obligation to answer any questions at all
could we at least wait till after the filing period
stuckey glances to edward for help
edward is silent indeed its as if something is twisting inside of him
stuckey plunges ahead
harris is preparing a bid based on our speculation of the corporations net worth
the price he ultimately pays for your fathers stock will be based on that bid
the more we know the higher our bid can be
its in my best interest to cooperate david
if he throws himself on your sword you promise to take care of him and his family huh
david stares at him
you bed it is
to edward youre everything he said you were
to his father do what you have to do dad
just dont expect me to watch it
kross looks at edward with a resigned smile
he hasnt learned how to lose gracefully yet
ill sign your papers
and ill answer your questions
whatever you want
he picks up the pen
hes about to sign
for just a moment
a moment mr
kross id like to ask you a few questions before you sign
you realize that youre a target
if you werent mine youd be someone elses correct
if you had a
reprieve what would do
quickly i dont think theres any sense in let him answer
i would take advantage of it
kross looks uncertain
he gropes for an answer
i dont know
there wasnt time
i suppose youd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently dont seem aware of wouldnt you
the waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours youd certainly find out about that
surprise suddenly flares in stuckeys eyes
oh my god
i suppose youd use them as collateral on new loans wouldnt you
have you lost your mind
to stuckey quiet
to edward would i get the loans
this time i imagine you would yes
as if thinking about it hmm
a moment with all this in mind mr
kross i cant logically make a formal bid on your company can i
a small smile youd be initiating a financial battle youd ultimately lose mr
youre very right
i think the best thing we could all do is go home
have a good day gentlemen
he exits from the room
edward is walking down the hall
stuckey comes out of the office and calls after him
calls edward what happened
what kind of move was that
edward silently goes into the elevators
the doors close
yells dammit edward speak to me
stuckey heads back to the conference room
edward comes out of the building
his chauffeur leaps to open the limo door
take the car back to the hotel
i need to walk
he sets off across century park east
vivian is in the living room pacing edgy the doorbell rings
it rings again
she opens it
stuckey is standing outside with a small briefcase
he looks agitated
he tries to hide it
im looking for edward
vivian just stares at him
edwards not back
i thought he was with you
stuckey walks past her and down the steps into the living room
no ill just have to wait then wont i
there is a bar set up
stuckey sets his briefcase down
he crosses to the bar
stuckey contd mind if i have a drink
he pours liquor in a glass
he fires it down
it seems to calm him a bit
do you want to know what he did
do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did
he handed the whole thing back to kross
on a silver platter
for no reason
what was he thinking i mean what was going through his goddam head
pours another drink what was all that benevolent crap
what are we going to become a philanthropic foundation
ill probably be the director of several worthwhile charities
i think its great
stuckey glares at vivian
a lousy whore and youre the gum in a hundred million dollar deal
mocking aw come on bill
its just business
he looks at her a moment
but what do i know maybe youre worth it
come on show me
lets see your act
he grabs her wrist
ill pay for it
what a you charge
twenty thirty fifty bucks maybe
are you a fifty dollar whore
he tries to kiss her and pulls her down on the couch on top of him
are you crazy
she bites his hand
stuckey slaps her
vivian starts flailing back
but stuckey is too strong
vivian staggers back at the force of another slap
stuckey slams her up against a wall and starts rubbing up against her
you got a mean streak in you dont you
he tries to kiss her again
stuckey contd is that what he likes about you
and suddenly a hand lands on stuckeys shoulder
stuckey turns his head startled
edward murder in his eyes belts stuckey across the room
stuckey falls on the ground
edward rushes forward berserk with rage to hit stuckey again
his fist hits the top of stuckeys head hurting edwards hand more than stuckeys skull
vivian rushes out of room to bathroom
again stuckey tries to rise
edward kicks him in the butt sends him headfirst into the bar
glasses and bottles crash to the floor
stuckey again tries to rise
edward rubs his fist
theyre not used to this violence and both stare at each other panting
you broke my nose
i think i broke my hand
a beat youre fired
edward weve been together ten years
and i dont like what weve become
ill cover any losses you have on this one
now get out you asshole
all this because of that whore
edward pushes stuckey out the door and throws his briefcase after him
edward think about what youre edward slams the door in his face
edward stands there reflecting on what hes done
to himself almost proud well i didnt plan that
edward holds an icepack to vivians cheek
why do guys always know how to hit a woman
right across the cheek wham so it feels like your eye is gonna explode
what do they do take you all aside in high school and show you how
it pisses me off
not all men hit
and no one is going to hit you anymore
softening youre quite the sir galahad today arent ya
a beat i heard what you did with kross
it was a business decision
vivian looks at him
i got tired of hating my father
a small smile it was good
it felt good
edward looks on the bed at her suitcases
nods im leaving
a moment dont ya see
if i stay with you like you want me to therell always be some guy your friends eve treatin me like that
thinkin theyre allowed to
what are you gonna do fightm all
ill take my money now please
edward reaches for his wallet
he counts out bills
he places them in vivians suitcase
he puts his arms around vivian
stay with me tonight
not because youre being paid to
stay with me because you want to
i do want to
thats why im leaving
turning to him thats what you given me see
i know what i want now
i want a guy like you for real
not because you buy me things and give me money
the nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand
you gonna give me that
edward is silent
i didnt think so
its not your fault
looks him right in the eye but i want the fairy tale
vivian comes out of the elevators
a bellman sees her and springs forward reaching for her bags
let me take those miss
vivian sees mr
thomas behind the front desk
ill be out front in a minute
i got a cab comin
the bellman moves away
vivian walks to the front desk
looking up miss vivian
look i just wanted to say goodbye
harris doesnt check out until tomorrow
yeah well i check out today
youre not accompanying him to new york
lightly come on barney you and me live in the real world
a beat you dont know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady mr
certain ladies make that very easy
turning to the desk clerk john call a limousine for our guest please
have it take her anywhere she wishes to go
bill the hotel
turning back to vivian see you again sometime soon
vivian smiles softly at him
she turns and walks for the door
a long silver limo drives down hollywood blvd
the limo driver pushes the button that rolls down the screen between back and front seats
youre sure this is the right street maam
its a big apartment building
the limo pulls to a stop in front of a rundown apartment building on a dirty hollywood side street
the limo driver a large latino man steps out of the car and walks around to the passenger door
as he does he surveys the surroundings uncomfortably
ths is rough neighborhood
he opens the door
vivian steps out
maybe i should go with you
this doesnt look like a good place for a lady to be alone
several people pass
all of them stare at the car at the driver at vivian in her lovely clothes
ill be okay
the driver confused watches her hurry up the steps to the apartment building
he drives off
vivian walks toward her apartment
the landlord is sitting at the front desk in a dirty undershirt
hey we announce guests here
you a relative of somebody
vivian lowers her sunglasses
landlord contd viv is that you
yeah its me
she keeps walking
you lookin good viv
i gotta find time to shop
edward stands at the penthouse window looking out
he is dressed now ready for travel
there is something about his expression his somber demeanor that suggests the way we saw him at the very top of the story
a bellman enters from the bedroom rolling a luggage loaded dolly along in front of him
is that everything sir
turning from the window thats everything
the bellman exits closing the door behind him
the phone rings
edward crosses to it picks it up
the maid comes in looks around
the lady she go
edward with the bellhop heads to the front door
do you have a car taking you to the airport sir
vivian looking fresh scrubbed without make up is wearing clean jeans a nice looking shirt and a suit jacket
her bureaus are open
she is packing
kit is watching
she takes the photo of her and kit dressed up hot in hooker clothes and packs it

kit begins backing out of the room

kit turns and hurries out of the apartment
kit enters the falafel stand on hollywood boulevard
kit enters sits at the counter
and maybe a grilled cheese on white okay
a very young girl is sitting just down the counter from kit
kit nods at her
hey how you doin

she passes the girl down the pack
she strikes a match lights her cigarette for her
the girl inhales deep lets it out with a sigh
she looks towards the window
jeez did the wacko in the suit
kit turns to look
outside across the street edward has accosted two prostitutes one blonde one a red haired black one
keep the sandwich warm ill be back
she heads out the door
edward is still talking to the prostitutes
im looking for a girl vivian young dark hair big eyes
they shake their heads

they turn and walk away
edward stands there not knowing what to do next
he looks discouraged and lost

edward quickly turns to find kit staring at him
kit smiles triumphantly
kit contd yeah

she turns and starts away
she stops turns back
kit contd you comin or not
i dont got all day i got a grilled cheese waitin
edward follows kit
vivian sits on her bed lost in thought
her bags are packed ready to go
with a sigh she rises
she picks up the bags exits the room
vivian stands in the dreary living room looking at it taking it all in for the last time
she suddenly looks more than a little bit frightened to be leaving
she musters resolve
she goes to the door opens it and exits closing it behind her
vivian suddenly comes back in
she puts down her bags
she crosses to the kitchen where she takes coffee can piggy bank from the shelf
she puts some more bills into it places it back where kit will find it
she turns and starts again for the door
she hears something
an aria from la boheme
seemingly coming from nowhere
she dismisses it shes hearing things
she opens the door
the music is louder and getting louder now its not her imagination
she hurries over to the window
vivian comes out onto the fire escape
she stares in wonder
a snow white limo comes up the street
a necktie has been tied to the antennae like a knights token
the music from la boheme is blaring from the cars stereo
edward is standing on the cars seat his head and body up through the open sunroof
the wind blows at his hair
he is smiling
everywhere on the street people are staring the bums the pushers the passerbys the tourists
vivian doesnt know whether to laugh or cry
the car comes to a stop in front of the vivians building
vivians landlord comes out the front door
his eyes go wide in disbelief
edward disembarks from the limo by coming up through the sunroof
he leaps nimbly to the ground
he crosses to the entrance of the alleyway looking up at vivian on the fire escape
you are really lost this time
edward wordlessly holds up a hand for her
with a sudden cry of joy vivian comes down the fire escape
she stops at the bottom stair
edward comes forward and sweeps her into his arms
he carries her to the limo as if shes weightless
her feet never touch the ground
the car door closes behind them
the limo drives away
the people of the street watch it go
