href b b cameron crowe december a close shot of a yellow legal tablet
a young hand comes into frame holding a pencil
for a few moments we hear only the soft scratching of pencil on paper as credits are written in a series of dissolves
the hand carefully erases and corrects an error or two along the way
and then the sound of an old friend
the warm crackle of a vinyl record
as we now hear alvin and the chipmunks christmas song
a lone palm tree rises up into a yellow afternoon sky
behind it the sparkling blue of the pacific ocean and the city of san diego
a dry hot southern california day
even the wind is lazy and a little bored
santa claus wears shorts and sandals ringing a bell as he collects for the salvation army
this is christmas in the southland
no snow no winter wonderland
just a pleasantly thick heat and an unchanging season as music continues
turning the corner walking into frame is elaine miller
she is a tall woman consumed by the fevered conversation shes having with her pale young son william late pre teens
they stand apart from the other shoppers
all around them is the highly charged salesmanship of the season
silver glittering fake christmas trees
she hurries her son through the commercial juggernaut continuing their lively intellectual conversation when something stops her
a workman is affixing letters to a store front
he has already placed the merry
now hes finishing the xmas
elaine is strong but always pleasant always clear about her purpose in this life
excuse me im a teacher
there is no word in the english language xmas
its either merry christmas
or happy holidays
the workman nods thanks with faux appreciation as mom turns away
the workman shares a look with william who shrugs thats my mom
this is the new professional class
its a mini condo community
rows of spanish styled three bedroom houses with common walls
move in on one of these homes the one without christmas lights
at the door is a furtive year old girl
she checks her cheek straightens her hair
she hides something under her coat and gathers the proper nonchalance to enter
we now hear the dialogue between this lively mother and her son as she cooks a pan full of soy based health food cutlets
the meal simmers unappetizingly in the pan
across the kitchen we see william
hes a great listener with a calm and curious face that takes everything in
so livia killed everyone off so her son tiberius could inherit the throne
thoughtful pause just like nixon
william nods intrigued
he has a good disposition
the world of knowledge engages him and he loves what it brings out in his mom
there is a small clatter at the front door as the girl weve just seen enters barely brushing some chimes
she silently curses herself
elaine contd anita is that you
i already ate
mom moves to the living room to greet williams sister
william peers into the next room
shes almost to her bedroom down the hall when mom catches her
we now discover anita up close
she is an alluring young natalie wood with a suspicious and sunny smile
im making soy cutlets
the words soy cutlets sends a small shiver through the girl
william stands in the doorway now watching monitoring as mom moves closer to his sister
she sees something curious about her daughter
youve been kissing
too quickly no i havent
peering at her lips yes
yes you have
no i havent
yes you have
i can tell
boldly you cant tell
mom steps closer and examines the lips even more carefully
to her everything is a quest for knowledge
not only can i tell i know who it is
anita is stunned silent
she turns slightly to look at herself in a hall mirror searching for clues implicating herself immediately
elaine contd and what have you got under your coat
this is the booty anita didnt want to give up
mom picks at the corner of an album cover now visible under her jacket
she withdraws the album
its simon and garfunkels bookends
busted its unfair that we cant listen to our music
weary of the issue honey its all about drugs and promiscuous sex
simon and garfunkel is poetry
yes its poetry
its the poetry of drugs and promiscuous sex
look at the picture on the cover
moms fingers at the edges
we examine the insolent faces on richard avedons classic album cover
even simon and garfunkle look guilty under her scholarly inspection
elaine contd honey theyre on pot
first it was butter then sugar and white flour
eggs bologna rock and roll motorcycles
nearby william squirms as he watches the gently escalating conversation
anita glances at her brother
he silently urges her to downshift
anita contd then it was celebrating christmas on a day in september when you knew it wouldnt be commercialized
that was an experiment
but i understand what else are you going to ban
honey you want to rebel against knowledge
elaine contd im trying to give you the cliffs notes on how to live in this world
simple and direct were like nobody else i know
these are the words that sting mom most
im a teacher
why cant i teach my own kids
pats chest use me
darryl says you use knowledge to keep me down
he says im a yes person and youre trying to raise us in a no environment
immediately cant help it well clearly no is a word darryl doesnt hear much
ever the peacemaker william weighs in
nearby is a poster no more war
mom everything i say is wrong
i cant live here
i hate you
even william hates you
i dont hate her
to william you dont even know the truth
william looks vaguely confused
sweetheart dont be a drama queen
anita takes a breath and then out of her mouth comes the strangled sounding words of a kid swearing at her parent for the first time
all of you
anita runs down the hall to her room
elaine turns to william relating to him more as a fellow parent than a child
elaine contd well there it is
your sister using the f word
i think she said feck
sputtering whats the difference
the letter u
shot moves in on the kid as we hear the opening strains of the moody blues nights in white satin
shot moves along a row of very mature looking male teenagers examining themselves in the bathroom mirror
theres the kid with a very mature looking moustache the kid proudly sporting full blown hormonal acne he slaps on some hai karate the guy to whom puberty has already
delivered the face of an adult complete with long jutting sideburns
and then a blank space at the mirror as the shot moves down down down to find william
he is so much younger without a zit in sight
puberty is so very distant on his horizon
song continues as we see williams perspective of these much older looking kids
girls now are visible and they are even more mature than the boys weve just seen
they flirt and glow arms trailing across the shoulders of the boys
whispering in each others ears none of them looking down
its a troubling experience to be this close to the alluring world of older teenagers
and to be so invisible to them
are you really in our grade
louder are you really in our grade
william turns to see tall adenoidal tim tobin
the most mature looking kid weve seen yet he challenges william in a loud theatrical tone
it is a voice right out of guys and dolls which incidentally is the school play in which tobin had just starred
william answers in a respectful voice
he is desperate for acceptance
check it out
william doesnt have any pubes others now begin to gather around examining william
he has never been more naked
how old are you man
hes not a man hes a little baby kid
he doesnt even get zits yet
how come you dont have any hair down there
in loud funny voice where are your pubes
their voices echo off the tiled walls
now everyone is watching the hairless william
he is confused by their meanness
where are your pubes
all eyes are on him waiting for a response
the kids mental wheels turn frantically
and from somewhere comes an attitude a swagger and somehow the perfect line arrives from what could only be a merciful deity
cool dismissive i had em
i shaved em off
it is a new persona for the kid the witty guy
and it works
guy cracks up then others
williams new accuser is suddenly surrounded by the impressed gales of laughter of these older boys
others turn away on to other things
tobin stares at william and then also turns away
william jumps into the backseat of the white ford country sedan station wagon carrying books
see ya pubes
mom continues driving william and anita home from school
cheerfully by rote to william in back put on your seatbelt
i dont want you flying through the windshield
anita examines her own un fastened seatbelt which mom hasnt noticed
we got our annuals today cheerful automatic received your annual
looking at his photo i look so much younger than everyone else
enjoy it while you can
camera drifts from mom to anita who can take it no longer
pleasant pointed can this wait until we get home
mom pull over
tell him the truth
tell him how old he is
mom pulls over and stares straight ahead with deep irritation
as in be quiet he knows how old he is
the other kids make fun of him because of how young he looks
nobody includes him
they call him the narc behind his back
whats a narc
bleeding for her brother a narcotics officer
well whats wrong with that
ever the peacemaker come on you guys
its no big deal
she skipped me a grade its okay
im a year younger
theyre im beat arent i
their silence is eloquent
confessing in a rush i also put you in first grade when you were five and never told you
a heavy quiet
she and his sister ignore him as they now debate the subject with each other
you lied to him
you make such a big deal about the truth and you lied
that one hurts he never asked
what like hes going to ask if hes as old as he thinks he is
dont you realize this is going to scar him forever
dont be cleopatra
we have to be his mother and his dad
you put too much pressure on him
and when he rebels in some strange and odd way dont blame me
matter of fact i skipped you an extra grade
horrified voice crackling he looks at his body the information affects him physically
new sounds come from way down deep inside
mom now begins speed rapping trying to stem the leak
she starts the car
so you skipped fifth grade
theres too much padding in the grades
i taught elementary school
th grade unnecessary
nothing happens in the th grade
all teachers know it no one talks about it
still in shock leven
and you skipped kindergarten because i taught it to you when you were four
still horrified looking at his body this explains
youve robbed him of an adolescence
adolescence is a marketing tool
hes got no crowd
anita reaches out to her brother
with the compassion of a saint she offers this honey i know you were expecting puberty
youre just going to have to shine it on for a while
deeply embarrassed william shrinks down in the seat
mom monitors his face constantly
she is raw and sincere
and yes inspiring who needs a crowd
youre two years ahead of everybody
take those extra years and do what you want
go to europe for a year
take a look around see what you like
follow your dream
youll still be the youngest lawyer in the country
your own great grandfather practiced law until he was
your dad was so proud of you
he knew you were a pronominally accelerated child
what about me
heartbroken cant help herself youre rebellious and ungrateful of my love
well somebodys gotta be normal around here
blinking still cant believe it eleven
william finishes the last of many candy bars
a mound of wrappers sit just below the mirror
he examines his face hopefully for zits
we begin to hear simon and garfunkels america
anita stands in the living room
the song continues playing on the stereo
i want to play you a song that explains why im leaving and try to listen
we cant talk
we have to listen to rock music
william watches sadly
anitas good looking boyfriend darryl a dead ringer for young stephen stills loads her suitcases into a large turqouise chevy
the suitcases are adorned with plastic stick on flowers
all coolness is leaving williams life
mom watches nearby worried and helpless
their house is more austere less fun than the other front lawns
take good care of her in san francisco man
darryl gives the kid a sub human look
hes invisible too young to converse with
how can she leave such a loving family
anita turns and heads towards them
she focuses on william placing her hands on his young shoulders
her face is very close to him now as she delivers this sage prediction of the future
one day youll be cool
he nods stoically hopefully
he is utterly lost
she leans forward and whispers in his ear
anita contd look under your bed
itll set you free
anita shakes hands with mom and exits
as the car takes off shell be back
in the distance we hear the whoop of her daughter
maybe not soon
william watches wistfully
he moves away from his mother
she pulls him closer
shot moves in on his slightly fearful face
anita looks back at the receding american gothic image of her mother and brother
sister waves to brother
she feels for him
music now shifts to the whos sparks
william locks the door
he reaches under his bed
its a black leatherette travel bag with tartan design
he unzips the bag its filled with albums
he flips through the amazing subversive cache of music
creams wheels of fire
the seminal bob dylan bootleg great white wonder
the rolling stones get yer ya yas out
the beach boys pet sounds
abraxas by santana
jethro tulls stand up
the mothers of inventions were only in it for the money
crosby stills and nash
miles davis bitches brew
and the whos tommy
with a note taped to it
listen to tommy with a candle burning and you will see your entire future
the heady effect of all these albums registers as we see him lighting a candle
a blue school notebook with ballpoint pen renderings of the names of groups like the who and led zeppelin complete with carefully drawn thunderbolts
also the name lester bangs
william now sits in class with book adventures in journalism
his hair is shoulder length
a dedicated teacher patricia deegan walks the aisles
william presses the food machine button pulls an orange from a vending container
he still looks younger than most of the students
and these days especially the girls
william sits apart from all the others under a tree
he reads intently happily as he eats the orange
its a copy of creem magazine
camera moves across the photos catching the expressions and fashions of the rock heroes of the day
ian anderson of jethro tull eyes wide and hair flying as he plays flute
neil young enigmatic with perfectly patched levis
the southern rock royalty of the allman brothers band posing and laughing in front of massive stacks of amps
marc bolan of t
rex his ringlet hair backlit by stage lights
david bowie in skin tight japanese one piece attire onstage with the spiders from mars
pete townsend of the who slashing windmill style at his guitar
drift down to a by line by lester bangs
william walks through the parking lot after school
everybody now congregates around the new arrival of their lives their own cars
arms suddenly clap william on the back friendly faces smile strangely laughing
he takes a few steps and looks up to see
a school official is hurriedly removing something from the high school marquee
which reads william miller is too young to drive or fuck all are laughing
he laughs with them and turns as his face goes slack
he shrugs marches on
the song weve been listening to is ripped off the turntable by a highly active man in a red promotional t shirt proclaiming the greatness of the guess who
he is a ferocious lumbering music driven presence and he fills this small radio studio to the very brim
this is lester bangs the rarely seen god of a then new art form rock journalism
a disc jockey with long long hair watches helplessly
william views all this through a glass window
he stands on the corner of a downtown side street halfway up a steep incline
he is the only person on the streets this early saturday morning
reveal that he is watching a live radio show audible to us through the small p
quite an honor to have the worlds greatest rock critic
and editor of creem magazine back home in san diego for a few days lester bangs
what is this hippie station
wheres iggy pop
dont you have a copy of raw power
lester isnt it a little early for this
bangs searches for the album vinyl flying everywhere now with no regard for album jackets
william watches intently
bangs thuds the needle onto a copy of raw power
were rewarded with a blast of iggy and the stooges search and destroy
a closer shot on william now watching the whirlwind of anarchy inside
lester does an iggy pop impression acting out a story for the d
that we cannot hear never noticing the kid soaking in everything from the other side of this double glass window
bangs walks with william on this sharply inclined san diego street
its early the streets are silent
bangs is about fifteen beer pounds overweight
his jeans are loose his paleness and messy moustache an emblem of the long days and nights spent writing
in there somewhere is a good looking guy
his hands are thrust deeply into his pockets and he takes big sweeping steps
so youre the one whos been sending me those articles from your school newspaper ive been doing some stuff for a local underground paper too
what are you like the star of your school
they hate me
youll meet them all again on their long journey to the middle
the kid nods they walk
bangs contd well your writing is damn good
its just a shame you missed out on rock and roll
you got here just in time for the death rattle the last gasp the last grope
at least im here for that
bangs looks at the much smaller kid shaking his head
its too late for newcomers
but if the kids age is an issue he doesnt mention it
like a machine gun what do you type on
smith corona galaxis deluxe
you like the new lou reed
automatic the early stuff
the new stuff hes trying to be bowie he should be himself
im not a big lou man
yeah but if bowies doing lou and lous doing bowie lous still doing lou
standing his ground if you like lou
i used to do speed and sometimes nyquil and stay up all night writing and writing like pages of dribble about you know the guess who or coltrane just to
write you know with the music blasting
the writing part
for a moment the serious demeanor dissolves and the oddest thing happens
its an odd and charming laugh the kind a tough guy keeps well hidden
it surprised the kid who smiles back
bangs stops at the corner and offers a pleasant but very final nod of the head
its been nice to meet you
ill see you around
keep sending me your stuff
i cant stand here all day talking to my many fans
but neither have anywhere to go on this early downtown morning
they stand for a beat hands in pockets on this deserted street
they are alone together theres nobody else in sight
william listens intently as lester eat a sandwich
his face is an open book filling with words
so anyway youre from san diego and thats good
because once you go to l
youre gonna have friends like crazy but theyll be fake friends theyre gonna try to corrupt you
you got an honest face theyre gonna tell you everything
but you cannot make friends with the rock stars
the kid takes out a green collegiate notebook and gestures can i make a note
bangs contd cannot make friends with the rock stars
savage bite thats whats important
if youre a rock journalist a true journalist first you will never get paid much
but you will get free records from the record company
the kids eyes widen
bangs in direct conflict with his brutal writing style is looking suspiciously like a compassionate softie
bangs contd and theyll buy you drinks youll meet girls
theyll try to fly you places for free
offer you drugs
it sounds great
but they are not your friends
these are people who want you to write sanctimonious stories about the genius of the rock stars and they will ruin rock and roll and strangle everything we love about
privately william thrills
it all sounds great to him
he listens to the grouping of the words every one of them
he madly scribbles
bangs contd they are trying to buy respectability for a form that is gloriously and righteously the kid leans forward as lester finds the right word
bangs contd dumb
and youre smart enough to know that
and the day it ceases to be dumb is the day it ceases to be real
and then it will just become an industry of cool
and thats what they want
and its happening right now
im telling you youre coming along at a very dangerous time for rock and roll
the war is over
of what passes for rock now
silence is much more compelling
i think you should turn around and go back and be
a lawyer or something
but i can see from your face that you wont
i can pay you thirty five bucks
gimme a thousand words on black sabbath
attempting cool an assignment
and you should build your reputation on being honest
writing in notebook honest
and if you get into a jam call me
i stay up late
bangs reaches across the table and william watches as he scribbles his number on the back of the kids green collegiate notebook
the notebook has just become valuable
they sit together listening to the beautiful and compelling silence
mom drives william to the san diego sports arena
she looks out the window at the adrenalized concert goers
she feels protective not just of her son but an entire generation
william goes over his questions for black sabbath
look at this
an entire generation of cinderellas and theres no slipper coming
william looks out the window at the sign tonight sold out black sabbath with special guest stillwater
you can drop me off here
just remember you wanted to be atticus finch in to kill a mockingbird
the kid doesnt answer
he silently goes over his questions
elaine contd as long as i know this is just a hobby ill go along with it
all i have to do is listen
thats what lester bangs said
dryly ill be waiting right here at eleven o clock sharp
if you get lost use the family whistle
he unhooks his seatbelt stuffs his questions into an orange canvas shoulder bag and exits
elaine watches her son disappearing into the stony rock concert crowd
its a windy night
everything about this image troubles her
she fights with herself and then uses the family whistle immediately
elaine contd sweetly too loud dont take drugs
fifteen concert goers turn around instinctively at the sound of a mother and then identify william as the object of her concern
all around him we hear dont take drugs
he winces nods and moves forward
music echoes from the open windows of many other cars
the kid tromps down the steep incline leading to a small steel backstage arena door
he rings the buzzer
the door wheezes open to reveal the keeper of the san diego sports arenas backstage list
famous to all those who attempt to enter this is scotty
he is a wiry humorless man for whom powerlessness is the theme of his life except for those few hours he controls the list
scotty is only forty but everything about him screams that hes an angry sixty
im william miller and im here from creem magazine to interview the band black sabbath
scotty immediately suspicious moves to a nearby podium and snaps through three clipboard pages
he moves back to the door and grabs the handle
not on the list
he shuts the door with finality
the kid stands silently for a moment
he looks over his shoulder at two chattering groupies watching his dilemma from the top of the ramp
they look at him sympathetically but he turns away
william rings the buzzer again withdrawing a copy of creem from his bag
the door opens
sir im a journalist and heres a copy of the magazine
the magazine hangs in mid air
youre not on the list
go to the top of the ramp with the girls
william stands there for a moment
unsure of what to do next he looks back to the top of the ramp
rejected by him just moments earlier the groupies now feign disinterest
bracing himself william rings again
the door opens slowly this time
scotty stands peering at him
in a rush what happens after i go to the top of the ramp with the gi slam
william inches into the realm of the girls at the top of the ramp
the wind whips
its just him and two groupies in their evening best
they now pretend to barely notice the young journalist who has been banished to stand with them
chattering excitedly with sophistication far beyond her years is estrella
she sports long unruly black hair
her partner hangs in the shadows adjusting shoes
estrella turns to the kid with great disinterest
who are you with
embarrassed to be alive me
im with myself
no who are you with
im here to interview black sabbath
beat im a journalist
im not a
estrella stares at him
moving into the parking lot light introducing herself is a luminous girl in a green faux fur trimmed coat
this is penny lane
there is an inviting warmth and real interest in the way she asks youre not a what
not a what
charmed you know
the two girls are deeply insulted by the word
sorry i we
estrella indicates penny with great reverence
this is penny lane man
show some respect
penny steps closer focusing completely on the kid
behind her concert goers throw a few woo woos their way
she seems not to hear them
groupies sleep with rock stars because they want to be near someone famous
we are here because of the music
we are band aids
she used to run a school for band aids
we dont have intercourse with these guys
we support the music
we inspire the music
we are here because of the music
william is nodding like a doll in a dashboard window
marc bolan broke her heart man
its a long story
im retired now
im just visiting friends
she was the one who changed everything
she said no more sex no more exploiting our bodies and hearts
just blow jobs and thats it
well see now i get the difference
shot drifts off him and picks up out of the darkness another breathless girl teetering on tall shoes
she is in the vicinity of
her black hair is cropped short and died red just like the cover of bowies aladdin sane
she is polexia the voluptuous one from riverside
the usual greeting its all happening
its all happening
did you tell sabbath we were going to be here
i talked to dick with stillwater i talked with sabbath
theyre all dying to see us
its all happening
this is our journalist friend
journalist friend meet estrella starr and polexia aphrodisia
and you are william
his name lands like a thud
here comes sabbath
a long black limo with darkened windows swishes past beeps twice
the metal backstage gate rises and the limo rolls inside
and then silence again
the girls do not discuss being rebuffed
estrella contd i think i saw sapphire in there
cant hold it in any longer okay
i was with ian hunter all night at rodneys last night
wanna see his spoo
i saved it in a baggie
she opens her purse and shows the girls something inside
william edges away
peering into purse im really happy hes doing so well
regarding whats in purse yeah
i know hes such a talented guy
i mean look at him
who deserves it more
looking in purse nobody hes so sweet
with compassion dont you just root for him you know
to go that little distance between good and great
thats not his
i would know his
a very odd look on his face william now cranes for a discreet look
whats in that purse
out steps sapphire a tall girl with taller platforms
heavy eye makeup
her accent is texan with odd traces of english
in one hand is a half drained bottle of champagne
in the other a fistful of backstage passes
does anybody remember laugh tah
as they turn come and get em
the girls scream and happily head down the ramp to sapphire
penny looks back and grabs william with a well placed arm hooked around his
he joins the clacking sea of legs moving down the ramp
sapphire slaps passes on the girls
as scotty the keeper of the backstage list watches penny now slips william forward for a pass
not this one off william who brought opie
the kid looks over his shoulder
hes with us
hand blocking william he wasnt with you
to scotty are you going to turn this into a thing
all of you can wait outside
top of the ramp
i dont want to cause a thing
privately to william ill go take care of this
sadly they leave him behind
the thundering arena sound of the collecting crowd the p
system blasting yes roundabout
purposeful roadies carrying guitar cases
the glimpse of backstage rock and roll
everything he wants to be a part of is on the other side of this door
and then it shuts
he stands alone
at the top of the ramp a tour bus unloads
it reads stillwater tour
moving loudly out of the bus is the opening band
this is stillwater
four road weary band members and their road manager
russell hammond presses the buzzer with the nose of his guitar case
its obvious from moment one
this is the star of the band the charismatic one
william recognizes him instantly as the guitarist stretches
the buzzer goes unanswered
the kid is invisible to him as the others now arrive behind russell
tour band manager dick roswell follows loudly banging on the steel door
he has the flaxen haired look of a former hippie but he carries the emblem of a real pro the newest silver halliburton briefcase covered with backstage passes
his direction is always forward
let us in were stillwater
were on the show
william is surrounded by them now
they stand together under the single lightbulb familiar faces a live action album cover
jeff bebe the singer his shiny black hair hanging in sheets around his head
ed vallencourt the quiet drummer his long arms hanging limply at his sides
his is a face made for the background
larry turner the compact bass player
dick now kicks at the door with his foot as william produces a copy of creem magazine
to dick hi im a journalist
i write for creem magazine
once again the magazine hangs there
he cant give it away
a rock writer
struggling forward id like to interview you or someone from the band
busy running behind im sorry but could you please fuck off
william blinks a little takes it in stride
russell sizes him up moving in the background
i could do that
you guys never listened to our records
youre all just frustrated musicians
do you know what your magazine said about us
what was it the singers incessant cater walling distracts from an assault with no clear purpose
in background that was rolling stone
fuck off anyway
we play for fans not critics
stung william shrugs
its been a terrible night but at least thrillingly so
cant help it i really love your band
i think the song fever dog is a big step forward for you guys
i think you guys producing it yourselves instead of glyn johns was the right thing to do
and the guitar sound was incendiary
gestures with fist way to go
he turns and leaves beginning his long trek back up the ramp
russell looks at the others
that kind of love is hard to give up
good humored yelling well dont stop there
yeah come back here
they wave him back as the backstage door opens again
the kid moves back down the ramp
they herd him in with them through the door
scotty quickly spots the kid and squares off
russell notes the kids swirling emotional state shoves him forward
not this one
hes with us
hes not with you
hes not with them
hes not on the list
hes not coming in
and this is my arena
and furthermore russel craves the confrontation and moves forward closer to scotty
scotty contd have a good time tonight
welcome to san diego
the band moves quickly down the hallway with william moving to keep up
a young and grizzled red haired roadie red dog catches them on the way
the band swarms around him
were playing here tomorrow night
aside to the kid this is red dog the allman brothers bands number one roadie
russel clamps an arm around red dogs neck
howre the guys
havin a ball man
when we have a party we have an allman brothers band party
everybody gets off
its family man
we all got these now
flashes new mushroom tattoo on forearm well see you guys in boston right
specifically to russell dicky and gregg send you their love
camera catches flash of envy on the face of jeff bebe as stillwater sweeps forward into a small dressing room
dressing room activity swirls around him as william simply listens
he holds a small microphone
his stoic look gives away little of the full body rush hes experiencing
as the other band members drift across frame russell hammond a true rock and roll believer speaks as he straps on his guitar and gets ready for the show
to the kid every word is reckless gem
and its okay because rock and roll is a lifestyle
and a way of thinking and its not about money and popularity
some money would be nice
jeff sprays some shaving cream into his palm and rubs it into his scalp poor mans mousse
but its a voice that says here i am
and fuck you if you cant understand me
russell smooths the strings of his guitar with a small cloth from his guitar case
the kid notices all these close up details of rock
russell contd and one of those people is gonna save the world and that means that rock and roll can save the world all of us together
the kids eyes dance
he checks to make sure hes getting the recording
he listens intently
and the chicks are great
but we didnt do it for that
we are here because we needed to fuckin be here not just cause we needed to away from troy michigan which we did
but what it all comes down to is that thing
the indefinable thing when people catch something from your music the thing you put into it
im talking about
what am i talking about
elegantly the buzz
and the chicks the whatever is an off shoot of the buzz
and like you saying you liked fever dog
that is the fucking buzz man
all we get are these fucking old ass interviewers who dont understand dont listen dont appreciate why we are here which is the fuckin buzz
william nods holds his microphone steady
russell tunes his guitar ripping through unamplified guitar licks as he speaks
jeff hustles to reclaim his own connection to the interviewer
the next album will be even better
its not what you put in is it
its what you leave out
listen to marvin gaye
russells face grows rapturous as he discusses this piece of music
russell contd a song like whats going on
that single woo at the end of the second verse you know that woo that single woo
proudly i know that woo
he does it thats what you remember
the silly things the little things
theres only one and it makes the song
its what you leave out
thats rock and roll
william nods says nothing keeps the microphone pointed
activity surrounds him
impressed we used to talk more about this stuff
see this is maybe the most honest weve ever been in an interview because you know our music
youre the first press guy weve made friends with
we dont normally talk like this to them
and youre supposed to be the enemy
what are you
there you go
still young enough to be honest
walkie talkie crackling ten minutes till showtime anyone who isnt in the band out
russell takes a last swig of beer
a roadie whisks his guitar away
dick contd all this luggage is going to l
william is swept out in the chaos of the pre show ritual past the pile of luggage by the door
its a colorful heap of suitcases featuring colorful laminated band tags each with a number
william sits on the backstage steps writing feverishly in his notebook
behind him two steps higher penny lane scoots into place
i found you a pass
amped distracted thanks
i got in with stillwater
as he writes the guitarist russel hammond he just thoroughly opened up
he is by far the best and most honest interview ive ever done
she nods ive only done two but you know
hes number one
theyre much more fun on the way up
william nods still scribbling
she eases down into place on the step next to him
her proximity cause him to look at her his eyebrows rising
she smooths them down with two single fingers
penny lane contd how old are you
beat how old are we really
isnt it funny
the truth just sounds different
you want to know how old i really am
she looks upstairs soaking in the sound of another band tuning up
music is her religion
william contd how did you get started in all this
its a long story
quick study right
we live in the same city
we should be friends
she takes his backstage pass form his shirt and puts it on his thigh the cooler location
nearby the dressing room door opens and the stillwater exits
excitement level rises as they mass in the hallway with instruments
we hear the amped voice of russell growing nearer
he approaches as william stands
penny watches hanging out of russells eyesight
standing in the supercharged hallway the kid is anxious to introduce his new friends
russell this is penny lane
stepping into view pleasure
like the song right
have we met
and do not let go for too long
there is history in their shake
their eyes tell all
shot takes us to william who puts two and two together
it isnt hard
they clearly know each other
well i guess youve
gods gift to rock and roll
privately marc bolan
other band members pass adjusting clothes for show time waiting in the hallway
and now singing the beatles song penny lane
come on lets go
noting kids shyness both of you
house lights go down
dicks flashlight dances on the ground just in front of them guiding their way in the dark to the stage steps
get in the huddle
russell pulls william into the bands huddle
their band ritual psyching together arms on each others shoulders in a circle
they sing a dew lines of the classic train kept a rollin or go see cal from the cal worthington ad they all touch feet and then break heading for
russell directs penny to his side of the stage
the kid follows
plugging in still in darkness russell hits a practice chord thwack
he steps on effects pedal
adlib onstage private patter between members goading each other the stuff no audience ever hears twenty feet away dick prepares to address the crowd from the darkened stage
it is his favorite moment of the evening the highlight of his job
from troy michigan
please welcome importantly stillwater
light hits the stage and the band launches into their opening song if you say nothing
audience response is strong
shot lingers on the face of william as he soaks in the most undeniably exciting moment of any concert the first thirty seconds
jeff the singer grabs the microphone and launches into some vocal pyrotechnics
russell looks over to penny and william at stage right grinning pretending to trip on his cord an elegant show off move of a musician who is now where he
before seriously stepping forward for the first guitar lead of the night
the kid looks over to see penny watching russell
cases are shut and rolled toward the trucks
stillwater heads for their bus
jeff the singer says goodbye to estrella starr like a sailor leaving port
russell lingers behind saying goodbye to william loading his own equipment
black sabbath passes with entourage heading to the stage
you want to come up to l
well be at the riot house all week
the riot house
the continental hyatt house
its on sunset strip
attempting cool right
all the while just over the kids shoulder russell scans the backstage crowd of hangers on
looking perhaps for penny lane
lets blow this burg
exiting well tell your friend miss penny lane to call me
tell her it aint california without her
we want her around like last summer
say it like that
returns whispers oh im under the name harry houdini
exiting to william the enemy
come to l
well take some more
russell joins jeff exiting and laughing
a good show is still in the air
see you dick
and now the roadies mick gregg red dog scully frosty estrella the wheel
well see you down the line
william is deliriously happy hands upraised
he turns to see penny
calming him hey
you just missed russell
he says hes at the riot house all week and to call him
hes under the name harry houdini
do you know about the riot house
i think ive heard of it
he had a message for you
he said its not california without you
we want you around like last summer
consults notebook actually he said aint
it aint california i get the gist
how well do you guys know each other
she smiles privately
william contd i got it
i gotta go
elsewhere in the arena black sabbath is performing sweet leaf
the kid could care less
he has bonded with stillwater
he heads for the door
penny walks with him
hes loving it
they pass a still scowling scotty flashing passes as they exit out into the ramp area
penny takes out an eyeliner pencil writes her number on the back of his green notebook
call me if you need a rescue
we live in the same city
i think i live in a different world
they stand in the night air
the parking lot is largely silent now save for the thudding bass sounds of black sabbath
in the distance we hear elaines insistent whistle
speaking of the world
ive made a decision
a very serious secret im going to live in morocco for one year
i need a new crowd
he is a rapt audience for this flashy girl
penny contd do you want to come
in the distance we hear the family whistle growing louder
its a plan
youve got to call me
its all happening
its all happening
he nods cooly
he waits until she turns and the sprints through the parking lot to the distant family whistle
williams fingers work the clunky keys pressing rewind
we hear a snippet of the intense and lively stillwater interview full of overlapping and barely discernible voices
meticulously he untangles the voices especially russells as he transcribes
the work of a journalist as william sits at his smith corona galaxis
there is a knock at the window and william scoots back in his chair to see a familiar face
it is darryl his sisters old boyfriend
william opens the window
darryl climbs in the window looks around the room that was once the site of his previous glory
darryl contd so shes a stewardess now
she and mom are still sorta
id say not speaking but i dont know if they ever did
nods to himself the things your sister and i did inside these four walls
i dont want to know
its my room now
we flew the friendly skies okay i dont want to put you in the middle of anything
we dont have to talk about it
you seem cooler
im thinking about going to morocco
lemme know if you need a little help with your mom
a little might not be enough
she still freaks me out
nods an old issue yeah shes famous
listen go ahead and do what you were doing
i just wanna hang in here for a moment
william nods and continues his work self consciously as darryl sits on his bed and soaks in the memories of the room
a long moment passes
darryl pats his thighs and rises
william slips on corduroy jacket over a tie dyed shirt
well its definitely a look
mom appears more nervous than her son
i worry about the drunk drivers
beat vague panic right
and heres that money i owed you
she reaches in a small box near the door gives him twenty bucks
its their routine
elaine contd your dads favorite joke
i dont do it as well
i thought it was pretty good
keep the small bills on the outside
and call me if anyone gets drunk
i will call you if anyone anywhere gets drunk
anticipating her like a parent and dont take drugs
stoic ha ha
see sense of humor
have fun at the dance
im glad youre making friends
they move to the door and he steadies her as if to remind her shes not going
he opens the door
shes a wreck and she knows it
yeah loving but firm as if to a dog
i love you bye
he opens the door
watching him leave is always a killer
shes not getting any better at it either
she folds her arms tightly across her chest
penny waist by her car down the hill sporting a different more elegant look
she cups her hands and yells up to him
he hikes down the hill squishing down the water plants almost falling the first time weve seen him happy in his own skin
miss penny lanes yellow vega makes the big swing onto sunset boulevard
she sings along to the obscure words of led zeppelins dancing days
william takes it all in from the passenger seat
huge billboards advertise not cigarettes or beer but albums
its a wondrous piece of geography for any rock fan
shot moves in as william watches takes it all in
he moves his head outside the window to see fully
her windshield is cracked along the side
the continental hyatt house
also known as the riot house
does tour guide voice every band stays here all the ones that matter
we all know each other
twenty four hour room service
like us they were outsiders
they were so outside theyre inside and insiders never even knew it because theyre outsiders and they are inside a place outsiders will never be
and why are we even talking about it
if youre really an insider youre never gonna say it
you know what i mean
beat working it out yeah
she makes a swift turn into a secret parking spot near the hotel
and were not gonna hang out with russell
you can but not me
what is it with you and russell
neil young and crazy horses cinnamon girl ricochets across the strip
its blasting from cars tuned into kmet
penny now wears her green faux fur trimmed coat
she grabs williams hand steadying her hat at the same time
they dart across the busy street
she stumbles a little on her platforms
he steadies his taller date
they are a good team as they pass one of several humming tour busses parked out front
penny blasts into the continental hyatt house william on her arm
the lobby of this bastion of seventies rock is more alive than most clubs
its a swirling mass of roadies carrying halliburton briefcases plastered with tour stickers mingling rockers and more than a few groupies with lower ambitions and taller platforms than penny lane
the feeling is communal illicit intoxicating
the secret community of rock
penny attracts a hailstorm of friends and comrades
its all happening
grabbing him like a shield and im about to use you as protection
aside these guys are with alice cooper
im going to pretend i dont know them
does alice know youre here
im just showing my very dear very wonderful friend around
hes a very important writer he knows lester bangs
english accent im responsible for his moral conduct while hes abroad
arriving mock drama penny lane
gods gift to rock and roll
uses english accent and dont argue with me
moving english accent have we met
effortlessly touching an arm here and there charming all she had four men suddenly circling her
penny lane contd ive made a decision
im going to go traveling in india
then im going to learn how to play the violin
then im going to go to college for one year
william looks at her perplexed and a little hurt
what about morocco
exiting not buying it theres nothing they could teach you in college darling
whispers call alice
hes under the name bob hope
i heard you were with russell from stillwater
i throw the little ones back
lusty laughs circle william
overlapping this dialogue is the appearance of our friend polexia
in tears in pieces emotional ian hunter is a fucking asshole
she hugs him like a long lost friend knocking the air out of him
and now overlapping this action appears superfan ric nunez
his eyes are forever moist but hes oddly formal and never feels worthy of the rockers he idolizes
tonight he wears a custom homemade t shirt with iron on block letters
it features the four led zeppelin symbols and the words to be a rock and not to roll
a felt tip pen is still in his quivering hand
nunez walks with them backpedaling as he says its all happening
i just saw them on the seventh floor
john paul jones
displays squiggle on shirt mr
robert plant signed my shirt in the elevator
five minutes ago he touched this pen
please dont smear it
and bonzos gotta new motorcycle in the hotel
ric is a zeppelin fan
yeah i picked that up
he tours with them but not with them
theyre on the th floor but theres guards there
so you gotta go to the tenth floor and go up the back steps
this is my very dear very close very wonderful friend william miller he is very close with lester bangs
its all happening
see you in cleveland
ric rushes back to the elevators
doesnt anybody believe me
penny nearby as william picks up the house phone
he shouts over the din
harry houdini please
as he waits he discreetly pockets the matches hotel pad and pencil next to the housephone
william polexia and an ambivalent penny walk the hallway looking for the room
william looks in the passing open doors each one a different window into another world
time to put on the lampshade
up ahead the door to their smallish hotel room is open
inside a band party in full swing
a clunky early model boom box segues from james browns make it funky to led zeppelins gallows pole
russell hammond is the center of this party jabbing out the chords playing along on guitar
much singing echoes all around
its a hotel room hootenanny and all members of the band are present
penny lane takes a breath and enters with arms extended and pointing in opposite directions
she does a flawless stewardess imitation with proper hand gestures to a loud party ovation
penny lane contd ladies and gentlemen
please extinguish all smoking materials and notice that the captain has turned on the no smoking sign
your seat and tray tables should be locked in their full and upright positions
she is instantly and overwhelmingly the life of this party
russell joins william
impressed to see him alright
happy to be there alright
russell places a beer in williams hands and exits
continuing in the unlikely event of a water landing the seat below you will serve as a give up oh the hell with it
they all applaud her laughing
william watches her with wonder as she turns his way and winks
jeff approaches the alluring polexia and goes to get her a beer
meanwhile polexia sidles up to william
she sees him watching penny at the other side of the room
privately act one in which she pretends she doesnt care about him
pov shot travels to russell strumming the guitar that is always a part of his body
russell is watching penny lane surreptitiously
polexia contd act two in which he pretends he doesnt care
and goes right for her
russell moves towards penny
polexia contd act three in which it all plays out the way she planned it
shell eat him alive
worried weve got to stop them
you were her excuse for coming here
i need ice
penny disappears out the door across the hallway
russell follows a moment later
the kids eyebrows rise
polexia regards the kid with affection adjusting his collar and peeling a hair off his jacket
i just worry about people using her
cause she brings out the good side in everybody else but what do they do for her
life kills me
do you have any pot
not on me
do you smoke
attempting to fit in but i
i grow it
i grow it
polexia looks at the kid laughing at his poor job of lying
you know if you were only taller english rich a guitar player and older
id be someone else
jeff appears with her beer and she whispers in the kids ear before she exits with jeff bebe
polexia contd bless me father for i may sin tonight
the kid watches as the boom box plays an obscure favorite of russells eddie giles losin boy
there is the sound of a motorcycle somewhere down the hallway
the ice machine makes new cubes with a grinding noise
penny puts ice in her glass
behind her russell moves into frame hands delicately riding the sides of her body
a motorcycle roars by just outside the door as penny moves away from russells exploring hands
with real indignation how does it end
you know the story about the girl who dumps the guy who has an ex ex wife the one we dont talk about and gets a hundred
okay five letters from him and then doesnt even leave a pass in san diego
im retired and i never believed you anyway
youre too talented and too good looking to be trusted and everybody knows it
smiling loves it youre retired like frank sinatra is retired
she makes a scoffing noise
he moves to the ice machine with a glass of his own
russell contd miss penny lane
let me tell you what rock and roll will miss the day you truly retire
he tosses cubes in his glass one by one
after the first cube russell contd the way you turn a hotel room into a home
cube the way you pick up strays wherever you go
like pied piper
cube the way you know the words to every song
especially the bad ones
mostly the bad ones
cube that green coat in the middle of summer
cube the real name you wont reveal
id keep going but my glass if full
he kisses her powerfully hands at his sides
she fights to keep her hands off him
bonhams motorcycle rips by just outside the door
come to arizona
we leave thursday morning
and pack light this time
the motorcycle speeds by again just outside
the hallways are crowded as william looks at the closed door of the ice room
he leans against the wall alone now
trying to look like he belongs
behind him most of the band has disappeared into other rooms leaving only hangers on in their places
we pan across cubicles bustling with laid back fervor
these are the san francisco based main offices of rolling stone magazine
we have arrived for the waning days that this magazine could still be called with a straight face an underground publication
their mounting success crowds the edges of every frame
camera catches the annie leibowitz portraits that hang on the walls lennon jagger rod stewart james taylor
we find editor ben fong torres in his cramped cubicle
sitting nearby is curly haired and mustachioed star staff writer david felton who smokes his cigarettes with a long holder
felton reads one of williams articles chuckling
william is on the phone in his own small room
this is he
william this is ben fong torres
im the music editor at rolling stone magazine
weve got a copy of your stories from the san diego door
this is the same william miller
william instantly nervously alters his voice to sound older
yes it is
rifling through tearsheets voice of god howling dogs the spirit of rock and roll
this is good solid stuff
immediately suddenly deeper thanks
you should be writing for us
voice now to deep how about stillwater
starting to do something
ben shuffles through papers looking for a tour itinerary on his promotional material laden desk automatically plotting the piece aloud
ben contd pleasant terse stillwater
hard working band makes good
get em to respond to the critics who dismissed the first two albums as workmanlike
guitarist is the clear star of the band
lets do three thousand words
youll catch up to them on the road
well set up billing dont let the band pay for anything
affecting casualness sounds good
we can only pay lemme see three thousand words seven hundred dollars
the kids eyes widen
ben contd alright a grand
whats your background
you a journalism major
what college elaine now gets on the extension
honey i need you to do that thing that fixes the garbage disposal she hangs up
the kid is paralyzed
well i know how my lady gets when i dont snap to it crazy
ill let you go
call me at the san francisco office tomorrow
the great lester bangs stands in the promotional album clogged bedroom of his birmingham michigan home office at creem magazine
there is nothing in frame that does not deal with music
in the background a scratchy and chaotic coltrane record
beware rolling stone magazine
they will change your story theyll re write it and turn it into swill
but besides that what would be wrong with it
laughs entertained you have starry eyes my friend
do the story
its a good break for ya
but remember this the kid listens intently and makes notes
lester bangs contd dont do it to make friends with people who are trying to use you to further the big business desire to glorify worthless rock stars like stillwater
and dont let those swill merchants re write you
still copying swill merchants
what are you listening to
william knocks on the teachers lounge door
a teacher answers protective of their sanctuary
urgently i need to talk to mrs
deegan from journalism
deegan appears in the doorway
the sun is still shining
its late afternoon as elaine miller exits her car and arrives home
she sees a few extra cars in the driveway is immediately suspicious
elaine arrives to find william mrs
deegan and darryl awaiting her in the living room
its a style intervention
they wear sunny compassionate smiles
whatever it is the answer is no
elaine we need to talk to you
nothing is wrong
i am a teacher
youre a teacher
we speak the same language
mom sits down
she is fully engaged and worried her natural state
deegan contd now im not a jump up and down person but something wondrous has happened to william
and you have every reason to be happy
knows her and calm
carefully gauging elaines face the teacher continues
deegan contd william has been gifted with a shining opportunity in the world of journalism
through a love of music and at an oddly young age he has received a major assignment from a national publication called rolling stone magazine
deegan produces a copy and places it on elaines lap
it sits there like the plague
deegan contd now you are rather famously not a fan of rock music but such are the ironies of life that happens to be the very topic of williams assignment
cheerfully rock music
warily to darryl honey what are you doing here
mom looks evenly at her son seated opposite her in this small living room
its a great opportunity
hell be well paid and published nationally quickly and hell go on tour with a rock band for four days
no small planes
he travels on a bus
is it time for me to say something
and in anticipation of that response no
william has prepared rueful lo that which i have feared has come upon me
lightening fast he who jealously guards his fears quietly yearns to bring them about
deegan admires their high strung intellectual parrying makes an impressed noise
with compassion no
i have raised him to be an honor student which he is
we have agreed on all our goals
we raised him to be a lawyer we moved here to be near the finest law school in the west
plus he has finals coming up and in one week he graduates with all his friends hes got no friends
nearby having anticipated all of the above william nods to mrs
deegan and stands
elaine may i present to you
your own son
william takes a lawyerly stroll turns to face his mom
lady of the jury
beat i wish to disprove the prevailing false belief that rock music is based on drugs and sex
true perhaps at one time
but rock music is different now
it is now performed by hard working intellectuals with
with blazing intellectual pursuits and i am going to play for you a piece of music designed to show you that my thesis is correct
this is going to be hell
across the room darryl takes his position near the stereo
the song is based on the literature of tolkien
and its mystical attempt to elevate humanity has been successful throughout the world
this song will change your life
mom stifles a cough
william nods to darryl who reverentially drops the needle with a thud
mom is trapped as we listen to silent static
the opening notes of led zeppelins stairway to heaven
william gives his mother the album covers inner sleeve with lyrics
william contd we ask you only to listen
camera passes across their serious and expectant faces
the intro in not short
we listen just watching their faces as elaine becomes increasingly impatient
when is it going to start soon
immediately overlapping the vocal begins
theres a lady whos sure all that glitters is gold
sprinklers click across the lawns
and it makes me wonder
mom adjust herself in the chair listens politely checks her watch
she looks at william
if theres a bustle in your hedgerow
mom listens fitfully
the song continues
sprinklers shut off
music is now blasting
to be a rock and not to roll
moms face remains stoic to the bitter end
and shes buying the stairway to heaven
the song ends
all look to elaine
they wait on her response
we hear the turntable arm return to its cradle
what am i supposed to say
you say its tolkien fine
they sound like nice kids
is it meant to elevate humanity
sure lets elevate humanity
after we sell you drugs and sex
all i have is my honesty
thats what i believe and thats what i know
flipping through magazine oh
heres a nice ad
she holds up the magazine
and ad reads in large bold type elaine contd youve clearly ganged up on me and i still say no
no no no no no no no
she shuts her eyes and blurts out something against her better judgement
elaine contd william nods gratefully and exits frame
hold on the empty chair as drums herald the beginning of the allman brothers bands trouble no more from live at fillmore east
who feels a very particular kind of loneliness
its the loneliness she got married and then raised a family to escape
an empty heineken beer bottle rolls up and down the aisle taking us to william
william picks up the bottle and places it in the seat back pocket in front of him
he has joined the circus and the feeling of being here is a lot more lonely and forbidding than he expected
the bus struggles to make it up the hill back rows shuddering loudly as music continues
you can make it
the stillwater tour bus rumbles down the desert highway
the destination banner reads almost famous tour
william strains for a look at russell five rows up
he plays slide guitar working out a part
next to russell is penny lane
penny raises an early model polaroid camera and flash takes a picture of a nearby sleeping jeff bebe
jeff grumbles from the depths of a hangover
penny stuffs the shot in her pocket
william watches his private heart pounds
polexia appears and sits next to him noticing his shyness
do you have any pot
im a journalist
well go do your job then
youre on the road man
its all happening
get in there
go talk to em
challenged william rises and approaches russell
he fixes the charismatic guitarist in his sights
shot takes him down the aisle to the jamming star guitarist
he crouches in the aisle and talks to russell who immediately seems moody
his mood is in the air
very professional russell
do you think we might be able to find some time to talk when we get to phoenix
i want to interview everyone separately
and i felt wed start with you and me
nearby jeff now listens in feeling immediately jealous
russell turns away
the kid squats uncomfortably in the aisle babbling on
because ive got a thing in a couple days
self conscious its a
you go there to graduate
sharply never graduated
and look what happened
youre here interviewing me
laughs from everybody listening nearby
its a good line
william makes a quick jot in his notebook
russell contd no no no
dont put that in rolling stone
my bio says i graduated
well come up with something better later
just enjoy the ride
russell eyes the notebook suspiciously before turning away
penny notices williams discomfort laughing warmly all while grabbing a coke and giving one to nearby bassist larry
how did you know i was thirsty
he didnt even realize he was thirsty but he is
he nods thanks to penny the perfect road companion for all
and then penny gives the other coke her coke to william
he accepts it too and starts back to his seat
hes been blown off and he knows it but before he exits penny grabs his arm and whispers in his ear i may need to stay in your room tonight
russells in a bad mood
hes very bob dylan in dont look back today
hes trying to write
william nods cooly they are comrades and returns to his seat
a large joint passes in front of him across him to polexia as everyone cheers doris the bus rumbling up another hill
inhaling deeply want some
a wall of pot smoke is exhaled right into his face
it surrounds him like a cloud
the bus shudders as russell continues playing slide up ahead
elaine sits in her living room filled with her books
large department store photos of her children on the wall
she feels her own loneliness and his too as she dials a phone number
has william miller arrived yet
could you give him a message as soon as you see him
several hours later on this ride
outside night and desert
inside a few cigarettes a joint of two glow in the darkness of the bus
the end of the led zeppelin classic whole lotta love plays from the bus stereo full blast
everybody is free and anonymous in the dark
they sing at full volume
william looks out the window in wonder
way down inside
the ten ton guitar chord of jimmy page
zeppelin all contd loooooooooooooooooooooooovvve
john bonhams drums thunder through the bus everybody still singing as they dip down into the city ahead phoenix
william watches the living documentary around him
he writes furiously in the green notebook scribbling in the dark trying to steady his writing on the bumpy bus
behind him someone is beating along to the song on his seat
he never want to leave this world
all enter the lobby like warriors in a pack
the hotel chairs are spotted with curious hangers on decked out and lounging
dick is already stationed as always at the front desk
the sad state of hotel service grates on a road dog like dick
he is forever teaching others their jobs
re luggage to hotel bellman if it doesnt have a number on it it aint ours
he gives key and a stack of messages to russell and turns to william who he makes feel more important
penny is nearby with her suitcase and tackle box purse
william watches russells guitars whisked away they are luggage numbered and
dick contd the enemy
here you go heres the key to your palatial suite room list plus let me give you a luggage tag
is this mr
you have a message from elaine
confidentially shes a handful
william cooly takes the folded message doesnt look at it and tries to pretend this embarrassing moment didnt happen
jeff exchanges a look with russell
nearby the walking commotion arrives clacking through the lobby
last nights clothes are now todays
she holds a travel case and hanger with some odd blouses
finally youre here
they kicked me out of my room
she hugs penny lane
estrella appears happy to have help with sapphire
who approaches william
come by in a few minutes
well do the interview
the kid exits and goes to join penny who is still comforting sapphire
russell looks through his messages
the guitar now in a case never leaves his hand
jeff bebe approaches regarding william standing with penny and the girls
intrigue is swirling in the lobby
im worried man
naw we can trust him
hes a fan
but its rolling stone
he looks harmless but he does represent the magazine that trashed eric clapton broke up cream ripped led zeppelin and wrote that lame story about the allman brothers band that
bummed duane out before he died
dont forget the rules
this little shit is the enemy
he writes what he sees
beat but it would be cool to be on the cover
leave it to me
well get a good story
plus our girlfriends read this magazine and looking at band aids you know
you made your point
ill take to him
penny speaks confidentially to him
if she is slightly bossy it is only because shes good at logistics emotional and otherwise
can sapphire stay in your room tonight
she had a big fight with ozzy and polexias not working out with jeff bebe
to sapphire and polexia you just have to remember
these guys are jealous insecure talented egocentric and manipulative geniuses
theyre lead singers
they can say i love you to people
but any fewer is a real problem
girls nod comforted she continues to the kid jeff bebe has so much jealousy over russell that he cant express
plus he never slept last night
you keep sapphire and ill stay with russell
william covers his disappointment over losing penny as a roommate
ill take her
estrella arrives with travel bag equally homeless looking hopeful
william contd if theres room penny squeezes him
he feels cool
but the girl he really wanted to stay in his room now joins russell disappearing into the elevator
he looks down at the message in his hand and opens it
it reads dont take drugs
he snaps it closed quickly before anyone can see
russells room night a russell plays acoustic guitar a notebook cradled on his lap
trying to write
its coming slowly
shot moves off him past a flickering television onto penny who silently and intently watches russell as if hes a rare and beautiful bird
he looks over at her she turns away quickly
he goes back to work
tries to catch her watching him again
she turns away just in time
stillwaters fever dog plays from the t
william on the bed a thick local phone book on his lap
his hotel room
he watches self consciously as the girls go about the ritual of inhabiting a room on the road
sapphire flutters a paisley scarf over the room lamp
polexia puts a towel along the crack of the door blows out the glowing embers on too many sticks of incense and moves to the phone
estrella has joined them as well complete with a bag full of shoes
instantly we have atmosphere and not much room left in this the smallest room in the hotel
william thumbs through the phone book with fascination
all these people
wondrous off phone book and they all live in phoenix
on phone hi dad
i cant talk long
im here in paris
im staying in another youth hostel with no phone and no address for mail
still wondrous from phone book alex
emerging from bathroom i was the one who told him what to tattoo on his fingers i was the one who made his shirts
i was there when his wife left him
on phone shes reading from a european tour book
paul and debbie finger
looking out window oh my god
simon kirke of bad company is by the pool
the girls mobilize by the window
william is increasingly aware that he is an outsider in his own tiny room
he tries to organize his stuff in the corner
is anybody here as worried about penny and russell as i am
the perfect daughter she winks at william who looks away
to polexia and william ooo watch out whoever you look at when you say that thats who you really mean
polexia hands up and throws a pillow at sapphire the kid watches these girls like a tennis match
russell puts down his guitar
we should talk about what we dont talk about
we dont have to
no i i went to catholic school
i believe in guilt and
you know if theres any to be had i pretty much want to roll around in it
i dont believe in attachments
just the music
im just saying its okay to talk about it
penny stands and turns
she speaks the word
the name is out in the open
penny contd leslie
somehow satisfied alright now were talking
but she continues saying the name in a multitude of different ways in different accents and with different degrees of indifference and passion and lust and play acting and mock
as he listens and studies this ethereal creature for meaning
is she mocking him
in love with him
she continues saying it until it no longer has meaning
and finally she sits next to him
penny contd beat now
have i helped you get that off your chest
the girls continue their settling in process
opie can i order room service
the nickname opie re opens a nagging wound
polexia hangs up and begins to dial again
put down the phone polexia
she does sadly first this is my room
come on youre a fan like us
youre on our side of the line
im not opie
opie is a little boy
im here to do a job
i am a professional
flipping luggage tag ooooooo sorry mr
has their attention now this phone is a big big deal
in a minute i have to go interview russell
do not answer this phone if it rings
i have family members with severe anxiety problems
she will not understand
wounded but what if ozzy calls sapphire
and i gave jimmy page this number
or a guy who looked like jimmy page
william looks at their troubled faces full of too much longing and too much make up
i have a solution
answer the phone
but if anyone without an english accent is on the phone
winging it just hang up
or say its the wrong room
its a good plan
the hanging sign on the door reads do not disturb
william knocks on russells door
a maid pushes up against him with her cart which now blocks the hallway
a group of golf conventioneers are now trapped behind the maid cart
they ease past william as he negotiates with russell through the door
we hear pennys giggle
then the door opens and its penny looking ravishing
in the background russell sits shirtless at the table
he playfully pelts the kid with crumpled up wads of hotel stationery
some to the radio interview
no im fine
ill just interview jeff bebe some more
as in youre on of us she shuts the door quickly
it hurts a little
he picks up the wadded pieces of paper stuffs them in his pocket
he leaves the door and helps himself to some soap and pencils and matches from the nearby maids cart
then he returns to russells door
he cant help but listen to the muffled sounds of laughter just for a moment escalating
he flips the sign over housekeeping please enter clean room
thirty days in the hole
russell and band enter the radio station passing through the now empty front office
as always russell sets the tone
hes feeling good
stillwater takes over they feel mighty like the beetles as they climb across chairs rearrange wall hangings and gold records and head down the small hallway to the control room
rolling with the flow are william and penny in her green coat
he tries to distance himself from her still a little stung by the earlier hallway rebuff but she will have none of it
she privately shares every great passing moment with him
he tries not to succumb to these charms
music segues to stillwaters own fever dog
stillwaters own record spins and it sounds good to everyone in this room
russell takes a seat near the open mike
jeff bebe is quick to take the other seat arranging himself to be just as close to the microphone as russell
william watches all as he sits at the dark back of this control booth
stillwater sits with late night progressive disc jockey quince quince takes a long hit from a joint and does not pass it
the entire stillwater band is now collected in the studio and ready for the interview
william cant avoid looking at penny lane who looks great tonight
she catches him and he barely looks away in time
polexia newly reconciled with jeff notices
the very mellow disc jockey eases up to the microphone as the finale of fever dog is just ending
the guitar of russell hammond
the band is stillwater
beat watch with your mind as they materialize
band members gets closer to the microphone preparing to speak
quince lowers his head shutting his eyes and getting into the music as the song plays out
the phone rings
ben fong torres is calling from rolling stone
can i please speak to him
this is ben fong torres at rolling stone
estrella panics hangs up quickly as if the phone has just caught fire
i think i just messed up
quince raises his head and continues on the air
the same song is still ending
look at the dogs wearing the funny hats
juggling just for you
freaks and family
penny shoots william a look
do you believe this guy
quince contd its quince with stillwater
its the night circus
the band scoots closer to the microphone ready to talk
quince continues looking meaningfully at the band
they are waiting
eager for a chance to speak
quince contd every minute a baby is born somewhere
hermetically sealed bags of human emotion
bags of love
bags of kindness
suddenly turns howd you get together
as jeff eagerly speaks quince lowers his head and listens
the words of his guests
not to get into a me thing
this is jeff talking
but i did start the band some time actually ago
this is back when we were the jeff bebe band and i placed an ad in a magazine called peaches looking for a guitarist and russell hammond answered
quince nods head bowed swaying slowly
with deep understanding peaches
jeff watches quinces head lower
its hard to know when to talk with quince
the depth of his mellowness is tough to get in rhythm with
i think he was a gift from god actually
nobody plays like russell hammond
sorta moved well shit
he instantly realizes hes slipped on the air
russell contd ooops
better hit the delay button
all eyes turn to quince whose head stays down grooving to some inner beat
he says nothing
the band looks at each other
we become increasingly aware that quince may now be asleep
william shares an amazed look with penny
quince is definitely asleep
russell leans forward and continues talking quietly with hilarious sincerity
russell contd okay were talking now right
why the fuck do you wait until and interview in arizona to say something nice about me
why dont you say it to my fucking face sometime
because i tell you every time i think you nailed something
everybody pays you compliments
its not my fucking job to kiss your fucking ass all the time
well then whos fucking job is it
because my ass is dying for a kiss
and i know yours is too
its my fucking job
youre all geniuses
and let me just add this thought smegma
penny covers her mouth as offers a look of absurdity to william
he offers one back as laughs are stifled throughout the room
william shares a look
quince is still deeply asleep as the usually quiet tony leans forward to speak
he cracks himself up silently
quince snaps awake fully in stride
the dong is called love thing
your mind is starting to take effect
theyre all here to see you swallow fire
you scream soundlessly
on the night circus
its quince with stillwater
love thing takes over as quince swivels in the chair
quince contd i thought that went well
the whole band is crammed into a medium sized rental car
penny half on williams lap half on russells
to william see this is what nobody writes about
the in between times
the phone is ringing
estrella emerges from the bathroom with no make up and a t shirt
she picks up the phone
across the room sapphire signs for room service
now she is far too made up
radio plays frees fire and water in the b
its mom on the phone
measured very proper may i speak with william please
cheerfully hes not here
i think hes in the bar with the band
they just got back from the radio station
is this maryann with the pot
estrella contd hello
no this isnt maryann with the pot
this is elaine
estrella physically recoils
cringing i thought you were english
could you please give him a message
could you tell him to call home immediately
and could you also tell him at full power i know whats going on
but im just going to say this and im going to stand by it
cant help herself you should be really proud of him
cause i know guys
and ill bet you do too
and he respects women and he likes women and lets just pause and appreciate a man like that
you created him out of thin air and you raised him right and were all looking out for him
and thats more than ive ever said to my own parents so there you go
silence this is the maid speaking by the way
russell and william sit in two large red leatherette seats in the hotel lobby
william shuffles through many pages of questions written in small script
his tape recorder microphone sits balanced on the chair
very professional now that youre starting to be successful you had twenty six years to write your first album
and youll have maybe four months for the second
do you worry that the pressure of the business will get in the way of the original joy of making your music
or russell blinks
the all consuming issues of his life are right in front of him
laughing i need three more beers and my guitar before i can answer that question
lets take a walk
russell walks the outskirts of the pool area with william
william follows him through the sliding glass door to his room facing the pool
russell grabs his guitar
they stand for a moment unheard by the others and regard the living portrait twenty yards in front of them
the off limits after hours pool area has been overtaken by the stillwater tour members
jeff bebe sits in a chair nearby
dick laughs at a joke
always the life of the party penny lane dispenses stolen towels from a maid cart
and she is the first to slip into the pool for some after hours against the rules swimming
effortlessly she turns a collection of people into a party
they regard her well out of earshot of the others
for a minute i thought you were actually a real journalist
you know its great
beat shut that thing off and ill tell you the truth
william shuts his tape recorder off
i trust you
im going to lay this right on you
just make us look cool
i will quote you warmly and accurately
thats what im worried about
see some of us have girlfriends back home
some of us have wives
some of the people you meet on the road are really amazing people
they both watch penny lane sparkling fresh from the pool
she places hotel furniture into the shallow end and inviting all even other curious hotel guests to join them in the pool
russell contd like you
and some of the things that happen are good for just a few people to know about as opposed to say a million people
dawn is breaking for william
you know what i mean
see youre dangerous
most people are just waiting to talk but you listen
so your question you asked me
i think about it every fucking night
i hate it
quietly i grew up with these guys okay
i cant play all that i can play im past these musicians do you understand
the more popular we get the more i cant walk on them the bigger their houses get the more pressure
you forget man
you forget what it was like to be real to be a fan
you can hear it in a lot of bands whove been successful it doesnt sound like music anymore
it sounds like
like lifestyle maintenance
suddenly confessional i used to be able to hear the sounds of the world
everything to me used to sound like music
now i dont hear it
you know what im trying to say
man it feels good to say this stuff out loud
but what am i doing
im telling secrets to the one guy you dont tell secrets to
feeling included no thats okay
well do the interview tomorrow
this is good
so theres the friend and then theres the interview guy
so tonight its friend
and when we wake up tomorrow interview guy
well figure it out as we go buddy
hey for whatever its worth you guys are really good
russell laughs at the kids easy naivete
he hands his guitar to the kid and joins the party
william watches part of the crowd
somehow feeling a little compromised
he doesnt care
penny gestures for him to join them
william interviews larry in the seats of the empty arena
on stage ed soundchecks his drums
how would you describe your role in stillwater
what is the chemical that you add to the chemistry
im the bass player
pressing for some poetry right
and when you take that away
what would be missing
not getting it the bass
larry doesnt give him much
the pre show huddle breaks up william a part of them
penny lane adjusts larrys look
she takes the scarf from around his neck and ties it around his leg
he looks instantly better
william watches in the darkness as dick takes the microphone
the best part of his day has arrived
in his important voice good evening phoenix
applause from troy michigan
please welcome stillwater
lights come up as the band launches into fever dog
jeff begins singing
russell reaches to adjust the microphone for a back up vocal and is hit with something unexpected
a sharp electrical shock
its just a slight pop in the loud din of music but within a moment something is clearly wrong
russell holds onto the microphone stand with a surprised look conducting high voltage for two seconds and then he snaps his hand off the metal
his face is white he takes off his guitar and walks off stage collapsing a couple steps later
dick is waving wildly for the band to board the bus which has been pulled up into the backstage area
he guides a sagging russell assisted by penny lane into the bus
get in get in
william boards the bus as the extremely agitated promoter arrives to confront dick
are you the manager of this band
that and more
you didnt even play a full set
dick whirls and unleashes an anger weve not yet seen gesturing with the silver briefcase that does not leave his hand
your shoddy stage set up almost killed our guitarist
you trashed the dressing room you didnt play your thirty five minutes
you didnt fulfill your contract everybody in
get in the bus
ill report you to every promoter in the country
im gonna talk to frank barcelona
i hope you have a good lawyer
he swings into the bus as the bus revs
russell sits pale next to penny at the front of the bus
he examines his singed hand shaking it a little to emphasize the positivity of her words
its happened to all the greats
thank god you didnt hold the mike stand with both hands youd still be holding it
this is a good thing
its a good good good thing
william sits nearby watching russell making notes out of eye sight of others
the ever wary jeff unseen by william cranes to see that hes writing in his notebook
dick swings into the seat across from russell
the bus door shuts as the promoter is still yelling
doris is slow to gain speed as estrella appears running alongside
she knocks on the window next to william
i forgot to tell you
your mom says to call home immediately
she says she knows whats going on
receding see you guys in topeka
ill catch a ride with sabbath
william nods with embarrassment waves to her as the bus races toward the now closing gate
casually to russell wanna buy a gate
before russell can answer bash
doris barrels through the steel gate snapping it like a chopstick to great cheers inside this bus
dick contd you just bought a gate
to the bus cmon doris
get us out of town
the bus struggles up a slight incline everybody rooting for doris as she eases out of the parking lot and onto a thoroughfare
what did it feel like to be electrocuted
it feels like a dose of lead shooting through your body
and then you see god and he says how bad do you want to be legendary
and god damnit
i let go
shaky grin as all laugh warmly rock and roll
jeff watches this charisma with thinly veiled envy
the kid scribbles in his notebook
we hear led zeppelins thats the way
almost everybody is asleep
william takes the camera and snaps a polaroid of a sleeping penny
she wakes up
give that to me
she grabs for it they have a brief play fight
he grabs some other polaroids from her pocket
he hustles to the back of the bus pockets the photo and settles down to watch the passing landscapes
she chases him down the aisle
music continues as she sits down next to him
out the window a long distance running team of girls keeps pace with the bus for a bit
penny watches them over sunglasses waves briefly to the real world
penny contd breathing heavy owning the world when we go to morocco i think we should wear completely different clothes and be completely different people
what will our names be
she snaps a polaroid of a nearby sleeping silent ed pockets the polaroid
she regards russell up ahead also sleeping
her attention has already wandered from morocco
what do you think of russell
i like him
youre coming to cleveland right
oh no no no
i gotta get my interview with russell before greenville
and youve got to help me
penny is still watching russell
you should give him a break
there are real problems in the band
off the record
gravely noting the word problems the kid joins penny in watching russell who is splayed haphazardly sleeping restlessly up ahead
i got it
i think your name should be spencer and mine will be jane
i cant keep up with you
no one can
whats your real name
she looks at him briefly
she puts her arm around him
its intoxicating but he doesnt quite know how to act
with her free hand she gestures with a hanger
as they regard russell sleeping nearby heres the thing about russell
hes my last project
i only do this for a very few people
and i think we should do it together he is almost great
weve got to take him there
you and me we can do it
because the other guys are good but he could be great
hes my last project
he looks at her
she imitates his face back to him
penny contd its all happening
william sits interviewing silent ed by some equipment cases
what do you love about music
ed looks at him thoughtfully
it is an eloquent moment
the kid tumbles with more questions
these interviews are not going well
william looking concerned over the state of his interviews walks into the backstage bathroom
he makes a few surreptitious notes in his notebook before noticing that jeff is standing there clearly just finishing a quick hit of cocaine offered by a local hanger on
seeing the kid he immediately hides the coke spoon
william pretends he sees nothing as he turns to the urinal and shot stays on jeff who looks a little high and a little worried
william is on the pay phone with his mother
the show booms in the background
beat i know
stillwater on stage
a great show
russell on fire
william on the phone
estrella leans on him fixing her shoe
right now topeka
he winces slightly holds the phone away from his ear for a moment
william contd im sorry i didnt call yesterday
its not like you can just carry a phone around with you
mom sits in her school office a miniature version of her home a fortress in which she is surrounded by books
the sun is going down
she cant resist a sentimental moment
i guess i just miss you and i dont understand why ive driven both my kids so far away from me
by all practical rules dont i get you for three more years
he is touched by her vulnerability more visible now than ever as music continues in b
elaine contd was i not fun
william has his finger in his ear
the din if stillwaters set now blots out all other noise
it is not the time to answer this question
i missed the last thing you said
mom takes a pause
penny now enters watching
angry louder william now notices penny standing nearby picking at a salad from a paper dish
looking at her he lets loose with what he believes is a private confession
penny smiles knowingly collecting his affection like another backstage pass and turns away
camera stays on william
he is suddenly and deeply embarrassed
hes just told her that he loves her and she knows it
he hangs up traumatized
russells hair is slicked with sweat from a show just finished
he is shirtless with a towel around his shoulders
luggage for the next city is stacked by the door
im on the you train
take me there
the kid plugs in his microphone
russell listens as he springs his first question
do you have to be depressed to write a sad song
do you have to be in love to write a love song
is a song better if it really happened to you
like if you say nothing
where did you write that and how did it come about
russell admires the many questions
he looks at his hand thinks
when did you get so professional
in the background penny lane irons silent eds shirt
grinning she cuffs his shoulder
to the shirtless silent drummer waiting for his shirt
im almost done with my shirt
ed watches her appreciatively drumming silently on a rubber pad
penny kisses russell who swings her onto his lap
in the corner jeff watches them all with a vague feeling of being underappreciated
and now dick enters with a large cardboard box
russell your dad showed up again
and on a lighter note
your first t shirts have arrived
there is an immediate buzz in the room as dick yanks open the box filled with new white t shirts
he untangles the first fresh shirt and displays it proudly
a silent beat as all examine it their first t shirt
ed stops drumming
there has been a mistake
it is a fuzzy band photo with the group name emblazoned below
only russell who stand out front is colored in and emphasized on the shirt
he turns away making a noise
jeff stares at the t shirt
hes just about in tears
there is a long silence and then
ed resumes drumming on the rubber pad
dick contd its the record companys mistake
and they will pay
shirts gone band happy
he drops the offending shirt into the trash as if it were contaminated and exits with the box
william watches as the two men russell and jeff move to opposite sides of the room
russell puts on a shirt so does jeff
the vibe is thick
russel turns to see jeff staring at him
can we just skip the vibe and go straight to us laughing about this
trying for a joke because i can see by your face you want to get into this how can you tell
im just one of the out of focus guys
here we go
william watches as russell fishes the t shirt out of the trash
russell contd here
you love this shirt it lets you say everything you want to say
well it speaks pretty loudly to me
its a t shirt
russell turns away
im always gonna tell you the truth
are you doing coke again
all the time
the kid looks down
jeff contd this is big stuff man
from the very beginning we said im the front man and youre the guitarist with mystique
thats the dynamic we agreed on page plant
but somehow its all turning around
we have got to control whats happening to us
theres a responsibility here excuse me but didnt we all get into this to avoid responsibility
continuing on shirt but this is the slow moving train of compromise that will kill us
russell makes a disgusted noise
penny lane exits discreetly looking back at william
jeff contd i cant say anymore with a writer here
you can trust him you can say whatever you want
eyes suddenly moist i works as hard or harder than anybody on that stage
you know what i do i connect
i get people off
i look for the guy who isnt getting off and make him get off
beat actually that you can print
continues to russell and yet why do i always end up feeling like im a joke to you
i feel nothing but love for you
were a family
he looks at the t shirt and starts to cry
embarrassed he grows angrier
jeff contd you want to pretend this isnt going to be a very big band
well it is
you call yourself a leader of this band but your direction allowed the t shirt when you allowed dick to manage us cause hes your friend
dont you see
the t shirt is everything
is it my turn
because i think we should for once say what we really mean
oh this is the part where you quit stiffening right
im so predictable
no i gotta tell the truth i want you to like me
but sometimes i feel like you collect people who love you and then very skillfully
you make them feel bad that theyre not good enough for you
stick to singing brother cause you aint gonna make it as a shrink
deal with it
and let me just say what nobody else wants to say to you what
your looks have become a problem
russell walks swiftly past a happy silver haired man who holds court with beer in hand
he dresses too young for his age late fifties
he is dad
dutifully hello harry
dad introduces a woman much younger who eyes russell hungrily
he got all the good genes huh
were getting married in july
russell walks fast outside the arena
william hustles to catch up
the two men walk in long silent strides in the cold night air beyond the backstage area
fans begin to recognize and follow at a discreet distance
russell doesnt answer
resolute wound up from here on out im only interested in whats real
the kid nods
russell contd real feelings
thats all im interested in
from here on out
what is real
a wave of warmth comes over russell
you know you know all about us and i dont know shit about you
struggling to be personal whats your
your family like
well my dad died of a heart attack and my sister believes that my mom is so intense that she might have contributed to it
plus immediately okay thats good
its good to talk about it
russel now sees some hero worship in the kids face and it makes him nervous
william contd hey man maybe we should go back
if they want me they can find me
william turns and sees nobody following but fans
i have to go home tomorrow
i know this is a bad time to finish our interview
hey man you know what
write whatever you want
i trust you
a big square chevy van slows down
a concert goer hands his head out the window
battle cry woooooooooo
youre russel from stillwater
on my better days yes
i am woooooo russell from stillwater
wanna go to a party at my friend aarons house
i know youre a big rock star but do you want to hang with some people looking to have a good time
russel regards the van full of kids
more fans crowding around
the kid behind the wheel unknowingly says the magic words
concert goer contd were just real topeka people man
he has said the magic word
russell arrives at the party in the rural outskirts of topeka
william watches as russell slugs from a jack daniels bottle
they sit in the bedroom of a mindblown fan year old aaron
he has long frizzy brown hair tied in a spray behind him
many from the neighborhood are now pouring into the home
eyes glowing you
are what its all about
you are real
your room is real
your friends are real
you are more important than
all the silly machinery
and you know it
in eleven years its gonna be man
think about that
wanna see me feed a mouse to my snake
can i have your belt
russel whips off his belt gives it to the fan
a joint goes by headed for russell
william intercepts it and passes it on
russell contd aaron
wheres your bathroom
i want to live here
i want to eat your food and live in your city and fuckin rock like i used to
i want to learn everything there is to know about your city and your town
and your way of being real
stunning realization i used to be you
down the hall by the washing machine
good to know
russell rises and squeezes past fans and heads down the hall
william follows russell protectively
a quiet girl turns and watches russell pass
we linger on her face for just a moment full of wonder
we should probably head back sometime
russell ignores him
holding red cup watch out theres acid in the beer thats in the red cups
russell looks at the cup in his own hand
then with his other hand he grabs the red cup and drains it
they move on
check it out
russell enters the bathroom
william stands guard
with a finger outstretched from each hand he lectures the fans massing in the hallway
please dont give him any more acid
william watches as a wobbly russell hammond in sunglasses now goes through aarons record collection
he places the albums over his face like masks
sa weet baby james
none of these people are gonna be around in twenty years
plastic begets plastic
partygoers are strangely fascinated by the rock star in their living room
william waits anxiously to use the phone keeping an eye on russell
russell is now strangely twisting dancing with four girls in the living room as more cars arrive outside
hes here right now
go ahead and put it out over the radio tell people to bring food and beer and chicks
were at rural route no no
william takes the phone and hangs up
keeping an eye on russell in the next room he dials from a tour itinerary sheet
william contd dick roswell please
i got him
ive been looking after him
hes on acid though
i cant really tell
how do you know when its kicked in
russel stands on the jutting corner of the house rooftop
the unlit unheated greenish family pool beckons to him below
its kicked in
bellowing to the heavens russell cackles at the joke of it all
william yells up from down below
hey russell dont jump okay
and you can tell rolling stone magazine my last words were he spreads his arms and tries to think of last words
russell contd im on drugs
the kids cheer
william looks around remains cool
yells upward in the cold night air
i think we should work on those last words
no im not okay i got it
i got it
i got it
i got it
this is better
last words spreads his arms his greatest realization it gets a skimpy reaction from the partygoers
russell contd immediately im on drugs
they applaud again
just come on down
matter of fact okay
he jumps from the roof into the cold algaed water below
he sinks immediately
one kid jumps in then another then more
everybody wants to save russell
its getting lighter
cars line the street
and now finally turning the corner is doris the bus
william watches the effects of personal charisma
wet partygoers surround russell bottle of jack daniels still in hand wrapped in towels
now a bond has passes between them all of them
algae drips from the corner of russells face and neck
thanks for saving my life
i wont hold it against you
twenty different kids thank him for the opportunity
glad to do it right on damn straight
finding the guitarist in the kitchen he clicks into time tested road managerial maintenance
easing russell out of his towel slipping his own jacket around him from russells hands
privately theyve been crying for you like a bunch of whimpering pussies woozy the band is over
this is my family now
hes staying with us
its all over
well just ride on to greenville listen to some great music finish the tour and leave those ungrateful fools behind
and then well come back here where youll live
i know what youre doing
and i like it
noticing william look at him
hes taking notes with his eyes
beat to dick how do we know hes not a cop
william laughs painfully as russell moves in eyes flaring with sudden paranoia
russell contd he could be selling information
to russell easy
hes your guardian angel
russell turns away
william shrugs with style but his lingering look is filled with hurt
dick guides russell to the door grabbing the kid and talking very directly to him as they move
dick contd dont worry
he only means half of what he says
very direct i have a lot more
just help me get my interview so i can go home from greenville
i have to go home
pulls him back i have to go home
you saved the tour
thats good enough for now
frustrated but feeling important william hands him some of russells wet clothes
william deftly retrieves russells shoes and smoothly plucks the guitarists sunglasses from the partygoer who also wears his belt
they move to the door in a pack
we hear the beginning of elton johns tiny dancer
dick faces the crowd and addresses them in his important stage voice
dick contd ladies and gentlemen the evening is over
we hope youve enjoyed yourselves and well see you again in
william gives russell his sunglasses to face the sunlight
russell stumbles out of the house to great cheers
the quiet girl breaks free to catch russell on the way out
ill never forget you
dick pats williams arm one more time good work
they leave aarons house as legends
tiny dancer continues on the bus stereo
russell sits up front swathed in a large robe alone and silent
the others have given him a wide berth
he feels silly and they know it and he hates that they know it which makes him feel foolish
he sits silently
william watches him from four rows back next to penny
she kisses the top of his forehead a heros welcome
the songs vocal begins
there is only more silence
then after a beat we hear a voice or two fighting the quiet and singing along
russell hears them and starts to sing along too louder now without turning around
its a voice everyone wants to hear
like it or not this is his family
passing signs announce greenville north carolina
lester on the phone
he is paler than ever in a room clogged with vinyl happily listening to the mc in the background
hows it going
its a small wooden walled hotel room in greenville
polexia tries on clothes
william barely notices as he talks to lester on the phone
rolling stone is calling me
i dont have my key interview
i dont know what to say
pacing assembling thoughts with his hands youre flipping out
this is how you blow their minds
hell ask you this is ben fong torres right
hell ask you how the storys going
heres what you do lets fry his mind
tell him its a think piece about a mid level band struggling with their own limitations in the harsh face of stardom
this is fun
william scrambles to make notes
madly copying think
longhand small script on yellow legal tablets
william sits in the tub without water
its his makeshift office hes surrounded with scraps of notepaper
he writes savagely and now savagely throws it away
in the bedroom sapphire polexia and penny watch the midnight special
sapphire looks at a room service menu
it says the food is hearty and adventurous
penny yawns too its catchy and rises to visit the bathroom
polexia contd hey lets deflower the kid
now sapphire yawns looks in her purse
who his the quaaludes from me
penny enters to see william writing in the tub
she sits on the toilet to pee
he gets up knocking his carefully organized notes onto the floor
he is brimming with things to say
more than he is even able to communicate
william contd you know i think this is going backwards for me
flustered i dont know
i just thought we could hang out maybe do some stuff back home regular stuff get to know each other better
and then id see you pee
i mean thats the way i usually do it
youre one of us
its no big deal
im not one of you
if you go to cleveland bowies going to be there at swingos the greatest hotel in america
ill introduce you to him and his security guy dennis
william stops at the door
dont you have any regular friends
famous people are just more interesting
he looks at her
even sitting on the can shes elegant and totally focused on him
carefully well i would be worried that they were using me
and not that anybodys using you but she swoons a little touched and moved
boy if this was the real world and some guy talked to me like that let me finish
continuing im not famous
but you could always use me
if anything happens
and i would never use you
even if i got famous
so you know you always have that from me
in the real world
if you ever have to go back there for anything
she looks at him curiously as the door blasts open
sapphire and polexia head for william
your time has come
did he call
realizes their intention what are you stop it were talking here
opie must die
they swarm him dragging him kicking into the bedroom
steely dan looking pale and somehow snappy perform do it again on the midnight special
the girls force william onto the bed and envelope him
their sexuality is fun untroubled
shot moves past bodies crossing frame onto williams face
across room sitting and watching
take a vacation from yourself
leave this to professionals
estrella and polexia kiss each other playfully
william looks confused
across the room penny laughs turns up the tv blows him a kiss
across the room
his sexual awakening may be downtime amusement for them but to him its an embarrassingly intense moment he shares only with penny lane across the room
she turns away smiling disappears into the next room
on the television
post sex pajama party
sapphire estrella and polexia girltalk about their first rock and roll conquests
penny is conspicuous by her absence
william is under the sheets listening feeling different now a man and somehow one of the girls too
william is awake
sunlight floods in from the corners of the window shades
he is surrounded by the fallen cavalry of the night before
sapphire and polexia
the phone rings and sapphire instantly snaps it up still asleep
lost in her dreams she offers the sexiest hello ever
half english accent hello
hi ben fong torres from rolling stone
william snatches the phone
lowers voice hello
ben fong torres is up bright and early
hello william this is your editor at he offers the name of the magazine with a swirl that implies high level importance
ben contd rolling stone
hows the story
william snaps into his very professional tone of equally grave importance
im getting good stuff out here
sounds like it
next to him polexia yawns herself awake
man i need some he clamps a hand over her mouth
jocular but tough now listen
get it together
were both professionals i dont have to tell you this
youre not out there to join the party we already have one hunter thompson
youre out there to interview and report
you got me
this isnt creem magazine its rolling stone
we need this story in four days
now i want to know how its shaping up
its a think piece about a mid level band grappling with their limitations in the face of the harsh glare of success
pause i like what were saying
let me try and get you a thousand more words
its in consideration for the cover but dont tell the band
the kid hangs up now shouldering even more pressure
he unclamps polexias mouth
greenville is so boring
to william any other city in the world and youd still be a virgin
im going out to find russell
will you take the laundry
to the girls what am i to you
tell me right now
circles have sprouted up under williams eyes
the orange bag strapped over his shoulder he lugs a huge bag of laundry
he consults room list
a variety of noises and smells drift from the band rooms
he sees room service arrive at dicks door and its estrella who opens the door
dick in the background
she smiles sweetly to william good morning as the door shuts
he arrives at russells door
two exclamation points have been sharpie markered to the words do not disturb on the sign is gaffer taped to his door
he looks through the crack at the bottom of the door
carefully and politely he knocks
instantly pissed the kid flips off the door
he sits down on a chair directly across from the room
push in on william who is more pent up than ever
he tries hard not to cry taking gulps of air as a maid cart swishes past revealing
a super energized russell hammond looks into williams sleepy face
williams eyes open
his own sleepy face is evident in russells sunglasses
the bag of laundry is still at his feet
russell contd well do the interview in cleveland
youve got to help me
i have to go home
come on man well have more time there
dont be tense
he begins rubbing the kids shoulders
hes waking up
theres penny also rubbing his shoulders
it is degrading
and somehow cool too
to penny you said youd help me
massaging come to cleveland
massaging hypnotically come to cleveland
come to cleveland
can we help it if we like having you around
william is a bundle of nerves and exhaustion now
embarrassed and frustrated
russell contd cleveland my man
you cant miss out on the rock mecca of the midwest youre with us
its all happening
rock and roll
weary rock and roll
we hear david bowies live version of waiting for the man
they sit together hair askew in sunglasses resting against the headboard
carefully russell identifies his thoughts
like his parents
penny runs a worried hand through her hair
i wonder how that happened
you ever notice that all our sentences begin with i
i hadnt no
cause we should work on that
he looks at her plays the guitar a little
doris rocks toward cleveland on a muggy summer night
the windows of passing houses offer rich edward hopper glimpses of lives and people william will never meet
william watches from his bus bunk at the back head on elbow
looking up he sees the rhythmic motion of bodies on the mattress above him as music continues
william gets up nods hello to the roadie and his date on the bunk above
he moves down the aisle
to the seats near the front
a sleeping russell sits upright hugging his guitar
penny asleep next to him polaroid in her hand of
the kid moves on
he sits with the bus driver whose cb crackles with chatter from other tour buses headed to cleveland
heads pop awake
like a slow moving shark doris pulls into empty downtown cleveland
the streets are empty
they pass the agoura ballroom where a man with a long stick arranges the letters stillwater on the marquee
applause in the bus
russell and band enter like warriors in a pack
william sags with the heavy bags in hand and over his shoulder
here in the middle of the midwest is an explosive rock mecca just as promised
the feeling of belonging invades all those in this lobby
fans and other touring rockers mingle together
outside in the real world everyone else is going to work
the lobby ignites as william stands near penny and russell
bowie races from a limousine through the lobby and into the elevators
he is shrouded by a jacket
just the top of his electric red hair travels the lobby as hes hustled by security man dennis in the elevator
and out of the chaos comes
jeff bebe and polexia smash against the wall of the swingos hotel room making love
russell and penny lane smash against their own wall
dick squats at the front of the stage and talks to a few fans in the front row of this crowd
a wild cleveland crowd in the building
the cities on this tour are getting bigger and so are the audiences
and there is a whiff of business now too
men in satin tour jackets and some disc jockey types cruise the backstage
a hysterical fan is led screaming to the nearby medic room
few even react its cleveland as the shot finds william tired and yawning on the backstage pay phone
he is absolutely ready for the worst
im in cleveland
he listens stoically
larry and ed watch nearby
moms sits in silence
william contd rehearsed im fine
im flying back on monday morning
ill only miss one test
ill make it up
russell listens in holding his guitar laughing
tell her youre a slave to the groove you cant help it
covers phone no
russell grabs the phone talks to the silent mother on the other end
its russell hammond i play guitar in stillwater
its my fault
how does it feel to be the mother of the future of rock journalism
penny passes and stands near william smoothing her pass
they watch a new pack of groupies prowl the road crew
they are more glam more trashy and less selective
they glare insolently at penny lane
this is the future
russell contd youve got a great kid nothing to worry about
were taking care of him
and you should come to a show sometime
join the circus
listen to me
your charm does not work on me
im onto you
of course you like him
he worships you people and thats fine with you as long as he helps make you rich
a nerve is struck rich
i dont think so listen to me
hes a smart good hearted year old kid with infinite potential
russel looks over at the kid eyes narrowing as he processes the truth
elaine contd this is not some apron wearing mother youre talking to
i know about your valhalla of decadence and i shouldnt have let him go
he is not ready for your world of compromised values and diminished brain cells that you throw away like confetti
am i speaking clearly to you
if you break his spirit harm him in any way keep him from his chosen profession which is law something you may not value but do you will meet the
voice on the other end of this telephone
and it will not be pretty
do we understand each other
always the teacher i didnt ask for this role but ill play it
now go do your best
be bold and mighty forces will come to your aide
goethe said that
its not too late for you to be a person of substance
get my son home safely im glad we spoke
she hangs up
russell hangs up oddly affected and shook up
some people get her
russell is still recovering
william feels embarrassed by his mother once again
william with the band
he yawns as the band breaks
we follow dick who guides the band onto the stage platform still in darkness
already stomping and applause is mounting
russell turns to william before taking the stage your mom kind of freaked me out
she means well
still rattled he takes the stage
we see the unbridled enthusiasm of the faces on the front row
a wave of cigarette lighters stretch out before them
importantly from troy michigan
russell thwacks a couple chords
he turns to other members feeling chills
its in these moments that everything else disappears
they bow and wave still in darkness
each member seems to have his own fans
dick lets all this play out before finally adding
dick contd would you please welcome to cleveland
this is very very very very fun
dick contd stillwater
lights come up
a full blast of audience love hits them right in the face as they begin fever dog
the band charges headlong into their set as various fans are squeezed up out of the crowd and onto the stage
who is in the middle of playing as he smoothly whips off his guitar and uses the instrument to send a frenetic fan back into the crowd
he slips back under the strap laughing
more stage climbers spring up where that fan came from and russell now watches as jeff bebe dodges a fan and comes over to russell to lean on him
russell turns to share the moment with penny dancing with arms in the air at the side of the stage
william in the dressing room eyes red with exhaustion finally interviewing russell
he holds the mike stoically
so when you play a great show like tonight
dick enters with great urgency
i need everybodys attention
the kid shuts his eyes
he knew this would happen
dick contd alright well the rumors are true
the record company has sent a big time manager here to try and talk you into replacing me
his name is dennis hope
i know youve all heard of him
hes got all the big bands
hes right outside
he wants five minutes with you right now
i think we gotta do it
pissed then bring him in
william shuts off his tape recorder
arrogant bring him in
well send him out on a rail
to william well finish on the way to boston
you can fly home from boston
william nods exhausted as dick opens the door
in walks a small general of a man in a baseball t shirt well trimmed beard and bowl cut
he holds the super new halliburton briefcase
he is dennis hope
a man from the midwest with a vision of the future of rock and roll
already in his head are all the things that will come to pass
higher ticket prices
greater distribution and accounting of album sales
he shrugs hello to the band
completely unthreatening hi
we already have a manager
hes been with us from the beginning
hope appreciates the lack of small talk
he strides the room with the joyful enthusiasm of a kid who wants to build a fort
russell watches dismissive holding his guitar
we all have our roots
i believe in bands holding onto their roots
but those roots need to be augmented
im gonna tell you the truth i may enrage some and enthrall others
i dont really give a fuck
your manager here needs a manager
if you hadnt run out on the contract in phoenix you could have sued over russells hand
but you left negating the contract forfeiting the deposit and you effectively traveled a long way to pay that promoter
to electrocute you
russell looks at his hand
dennis hope contd we can all work together
your damages have put you way into the hole for this tour
right now you owe the record company more than youve got
but your records selling theres money to be made
so ive brought a plane in we can add more shows to make up the difference
immediately we travel by bus
doris is the soul of this band
that bus has been our home since we were the jeff bebe band
dick watches his loyal band with admiration
hey man its travel on a pogo stick if i thought wed make more money
you can play more dates with a plane
penny lane stands on stage facing the empty arena
the roadies have packed up and moved on
she is alone in the poetic and trash filled structure that was just hours ago filled with people
behavior to come the band meeting continues
passionate hey man its not about the money
its about playing music and turning people on
the band agrees
delicately yes of course
but on the distasteful subject of money
youre making it right now and its all he gestures to infinity
dennis hope contd out there
im just talking about bringing it bringing his hand together in a fist he returns it close to his heart
dennis hope contd back here
the band looks at dick who manages not to be speechless
but why should we pay you for something we can do ourselves
immediately do you know how to keep from getting charged for the ice below the floorboards of chicago stadium
do you know how to do a headlining tour do you claire rothman at the l
do you know bobbi cowan lisa robinson jim ladd frank barcelona
look around amazed this is cleveland
wheres kid leo
basics do you know how you get a record not pressed but played
do you know
i didnt invent the rainy day man
i just own the best umbrella
band members are now listening curiously spellbound
dennis hope contd because as much as you may believe that it will last forever it does not last forever
your biggest fan right now soon theyre going to go to college gonna wanna buy clothes spend that money some other way and you know what
the final insult theyll tape your record from a friends copy
russell stops fingering his guitar
shot moves across the faces of the band members
dennis hope contd youve got to take what you can when you can while you can
and youve got to do it now thats what the big boys do
the band squirms but listens
dennis hope contd because if you think mick jagger will still be out there trying to be a rock star at age fifty youre sadly sadly mistaken
now hes reaching them
their slackened roar weary faces stare back at the young dynamo
flustered yeah well
well think about what you said
casually no no
you dont understand
ill think about it
im not auditioning
i came here to decide whether i want to represent you
so ill stand outside for a moment and think about whether want to stay
he leaves the room with a pleasant shrug
william watches their body language
no one wants to talk first
their faces read as who was that guy and how can we talk him into staying
william watches as the band stands inside the new plane
dennis hope looks on
this is not us
this is too much
he looks around for support
grim nodding faces
russell contd impressed at seat this is too much
william watches as russell reclines
russell grabs penny and she falls into the seat next to him
we hear the loud oncoming sound of the plane in flight as dennis cooly asks for pennys seat
do you mind
doris the bus stays behind in the parking lot abandoned near a field
the new plane lifts off in the background as the bus sits alone as if crying steel tears
bus banner reads simply cleveland
reprise ending of whole lotta love
the girls sit on the jumper seats at the back of the plane with william
william trudges the hallway with tape recorder and notebook trolling for russell
he passes boston travelogue posters on the walls
a few room doors are open he looks for any sign of the guitarist
william veers into dicks room where a poker game full of roadies is in progress
the room is thick with exotic smoke
they are a bunch of road hardened snobs smoking cigars and other items famous to themselves listening not to rock and roll
but sarah vaughn
anyone seen russell
door widens to reveal russell
welcome to the road crew poker party
this games been going of for two years
thats mick hes with the who
thats john with j
and thats richard with the eagles
and you know the wheel
grumbling roadies continue playing
like an old pro the kid turns down a cola can hash pipe
this hand is down to dick and a roadie named reg from humble pie
for fifty dollars and a case of heineken i will put into the pot
three lovely ladies including the famous penny lane
the band aids who need to exit our tour before new york
its a deal
dick lays down three tens
reg lays down three kings
three lovely ladies
now in the custody of humble pie
alright so we owe you fifty dollars and a case of heineken
embarrassed russell notices the kids face
he leans over and speaks confidentially to him
nobodys feelings are getting hurt here
she already knows leslies coming to new york tomorrow
they all understand
this is the circus
everybodys trying not to go home
nobodys saying goodbye
no i got it
these are the rules that come with every electric guitar and every amplifier
theyre not just written anywhere
rock and roll brother
but the kid feels bad and russell knows it
russell contd quit looking at me like that
the kid is still stuck on the road
he is in hell now
wearily with deep circles under his eyes he shuts his eyes for a moment
another band is moving through
keep this hallway clear
william and penny sit on opposite ends of a blue locker room bench
its a small dressing room crowded with roadies guitars and men in stages of half dress
piles of luggage headed for new york sit by the door
the door suddenly opens and dick arrives with champagne and a cake decorated with a sparkler
it is placed in pennys lap
it reads unforgettable penny
they gather now as the cake sits before a surprised and enchanted penny lane
happy birthday from us
william watches her face as she reads the message on the cake
it hasnt sunk in yet
russell produces a piece of hotel stationery
he reads a poem
so penny our friend has gained another year
but long ago she threw it in gear
she rocked the south the east and west
could you please get off this endless tour where were black sabbaths fucking special guest
russell contd she says shes retired though weve heard that before
she chose us
and in penny lane we trust she is a fan of this band
much more so than us
william watches her face
still enchanted she hands out slices of the cake
to the point sorry the plane isnt bigger
it hits her
she looks at william for a clue
his truthful face does not look away
now she knows
she turns to the others the plane isnt bigger
shot moves in on penny as she blinks just a little cutting into the cake still mugging for everybody covering it all with a layer of sweet giddy laughter
shot comes to rest behind her her head turning to connect with band members
each of them look away nobody maintaining eye contact with her except the one she now doesnt look at
she blows out the candles vamping marilyn monroe style and sucks off the frosting seductively to cheers
russell watches as we push in on penny
she notices all the luggage is gone only her two cases remain by the door
william exits a backstage portosan
penny catches him by the grilling area where catering is preparing for the outdoor event
their laminated passes swing from around their necks
thuding in the distance stillwater plays for a cheering outdoor crowd
the sound of summer insects in the air
so it wasnt a birthday party it was a farewell
william doesnt answer
he looks at her blowing some hair out of her face
penny contd you think you can fool me
i read you
i know what youre thinking
touched youre worried about me and russell
i gotta work on that
youre so sweet
god if there was more of you in him
dont tell me this stuff
i want to like him
concerned for him did you miss your test or something
he shakes his head
its so beyond a test
penny contd i know im not on the plane and im not going on some other bands bus
mean i could go with the sabbath road crew but that would be pathetic
the girls are all going with humble pie
if you could find out from russell quietly penny a decision forget it
im flying to new york myself
i have a bunch of partial tickets
i know his ex wife current girlfriends going to be there williams eyebrows rise
she examines his face for clues
im not sure thats a good idea
what are you saying
what do you know
did russell say something
i dont know anything
i know he wants me there
he gave me a cake
he wrote me that sweet poem
loud wake up
dont go to new york
what are you telling me
she looks so achingly beautiful to him
because youre not who you said you were
i thought you were retired
im not who i said i was
im just like you
i love music so this is my family
some people like tractors and they hang out with tractor people
whats the worst that could happen if i go to new york
little girl i get my little heart broken
you eat people alive
she tears some leaves off a tree
he looks at her unable to formulate a response
accusatory im sorry i told you so much
you have some way of making everybody tell you all their secrets
thats a good one
tell me too much and make it my fault
he continues walking she follows
they have ventured outside the backstage area onto adjoining boston farmland
the show booms in the background
youve seen whats happened
russell and i fell in love
how much i dont know
but this is the first time ive fallen for someone really fallen
since iggy and im not happy about it
beat you slept with iggy pop
she says nothing
william contd sputtering why dont you just tell me now who else so when i go to the record store i know who to be jealous of
because right now its looking like the whole store
she stares at him
teasing defiant youll remember me forever
i was there when you lost your virginity
upset at the memory so was steely dan
it was a crowded room
she laughs cant help it
then you make me laugh
i think im gonna cry
continuing i thought we were going to morocco
theres no morocco
theres never been a morocco
theres not even a penny lane
i dont even know your real name
if i ever met a guy in the real world who looked at me the way you just looked at me
when and where does the real world occur
i am really
all these rules and all these sayings
you know youre too sweet for rock and roll
where do you get off
where do you get sweet
im not sweet
im dark and mysterious and pissed off and could be very dangerous to all of you
im not sweet and you should know that about me
i am the enemy
youre not any of those things and thats what i love about you
william stands there in disbelief unable to look at her
you fall in love to keep from falling in love
i dont want to go home
well i have to go home
and you never helped me
yes i did
that disc jockey in arizona got a better interview than me
and he was asleep
he starts walking back to the stage
they are two very young kids thrashed by the seas of rock and roll
his frustration increases
she just doesnt get it
applause in b
she grabs his shirt
you should be happy for me
you dont know what he says to me in private
maybe it is love
as much as it can be with someone who blurts sold you to humble pie for fifty dollars and a case of beer
i was there
he is instantly sorry
her world privately crumbles but she tries to remain stoic and carefree
what kind of beer
sapphire polexia and estrella bump along to the music and the road
they strain to maintain dignity in these decidedly third class surroundings
theres only one small blurry window
who did this to us
mom on the phone
then dont come home
dont do this to me
if youre going to miss graduation dont come home
she hangs up
william on the phone
elaine faces her humanities class
she stands in an amphitheater style inner city college classroom decorated with colorful unorthodox artifacts from her home
these earnest city college students listen to her
but she cannot continue
there is a thundering upset inside her
i cant concentrate
beat confesses unhinged rock stars kidnaped my son
russell and band bounces down in nyc
russell listens to music on headphones plugged into large boom box
william watches facing the band from the jump seat of their limousine heading into new york
up ahead manhattan looms beautiful and scary
just like i pictured it
skyscrapers and everything
to william we showed you america
we did everything but get you laid
they look at each other curiously
how much does the other guy know
russell and band spill out of limo
the new york cluster of hardcore stillwater fans wait outside
they hold collectors sleeves covering albums to be autographed and fresh magic markers in hand
william in tow crawls out of the limo last
dick goes to work pulling luggage from the trunk
a serious looking fan lenny approaches russell with an autograph card
im from the church of lenny
we bow to his will and all that it represents the king of the king of kings
make it out to
russell nods of course
he signs as dick approaches with a well placed word in his right ear
william turns expecting to see penny
instead we see the long limbed athletic pretty and collegiate leslie
she holds a nikon camera and snaps their picture
your room is completely stocked far away from any noisy ice machines elevators or maid quarters
the air conditioning is already on
and here is your security key by the way you look stunning
taking treatment for granted thanksillseeyoulater
nearby the young journalist studies the tours subtle shift in welcoming leslie
dicks new york side is almost military
bags in five
cars leave for the party at six
william studies leslie everyone saying hello to her everyone knowing the subtext
nobody saying a word
william pulls his heavy bag out of the back of the limousine
the bag breaks and the contents spill out onto the new york sidewalk
bars of soap ashtrays hotel keys crumpled paper the contraband t shirt do not disturb signs notes towels and thick telephone books from every city
dick contd you know
there are lighter souvenirs
embarrassed well i kept thinking i was going home the next day i did too
fifteen years ago
all help him with his spilled souvenirs
russell shares a private look with the kid
nearby leslie greets other band members
its super zeppelin fan ric nunez
whispers its all happening
zeppelin is at the plaza
sos four other bands
theyre partying up there right now
sapphire and miss penny lane too
she wants you to call her
william reacts theyre all staying under the name emily rugburn
william takes in the information while regarding rics new custom shirt which features the words to zeppelins the rain song
exiting with leslie after the party
ill come to your room i promise
this is leslie by the way
leslie this is our wayward friend from rolling stone
they shake she smiles randomly
william checks in
sir you have an urgent call from a mr
ben fong torres
hes holding for you right now
william takes the phone
the clerk watches curiously as the kid adopts a new persona
deep voice hello
on a rainy day in san francisco ben fong torres stands in the copy strewn office of the young editor publisher jann wenner
several other editors are also present in the background including david felton with cigarette holder in mouth and a prep school fact checker named allison
its gonna be a cover
neal preston will shoot em next week in l
we need you back in san francisco tomorrow
well finish the story here
william is overwhelmed with many emotions fear topping the list
ben contd you can tell the band
allison our fact checker needs you to transmit whatever you have of the story tonight now along with your notes
there is a mojo at the daily news theyll let us use mojo
its a very modern machine that transmits pages over the telephone
it only takes eighteen minutes a page
the sound of feet on pavement
william looks at addresses hustling to the daily news office
william tears pages from his notebook and feeds them into the large and clunky earliest model fax machine the mojo
we hear david bowie
the jean genie
william weaves exhausted into the stillwater press party at this legendary new york nightspot
the doorman who checks i
s sees the kid and expresses great doubt
hes okay hes with us hope shoves him past the guard and sends him into a very mature new world
the famous hub of new york rock and roll
a strong whiff of decadence mixes with youthful naivete
not a hippie in sight
william walks through looking for familiar faces
overhead we hear stillwater
if you say nothing
the party is filled with scenesters long silver haired glamsters some british journalists and many hunched young skinny bodies in leather jackets
russell grabs him by the arm
there you are ya little fucker
come on i have some good news
ill piss to that
they enter the small bathroom
russell bolts the door faces the urinal and pees
his own music throbs in the next room
dennis hope took me aside and wants to manage me solo
says to lose the band by february
should i do it
i have no perspective anymore
william pees in silence
russell contd at what point do i just take the hint
nobody loves this band
people like us do they love us
then pissed oh get this somebody told penny lane i sold her for beer
the network of these chicks
like i would do that
its jeff who told her right
not you right
none of these guys can just calm down and be a fuckin adult
now shes here freaking out
leslie can smell it
ive got something to tell but he finds himself trailing russell to the back room bar
leslie in the bathroom
penny enters and watches her discreetly
they stand together side by side at the mirror
leslie looks once turns and then turns back at penny
william sits with the band
over jeffs head penny hangs nearby at the outskirts drinking and dancing
they share a look feigning casualty
you guys you guys beat youre gonna be on the cover of rolling stone
stunned and overwhelmed the band waits a beat lets it sink in
and goes wild
russell stunned too looks at the kid
its big news
jeff stands immediately eyes moist glass raised
tears welling instantly the cover of rolling stone
and we made it together
they dont just put somebody with one little hit on the cover of rolling stone fucking magazine man
we made it
the band nods solemnly importantly
jeff contd continuing damn it im gonna enjoy this
the first time i bought that magazine the beatles were on the cover
four of them
four of us
they begin singing the then current dr
hook and the medicine show hit the cover of the rolling stone to william
who is that girl
shes creeping me out
shes not with any of you is she
shes with me
and now leslie has confirmation
a symphony of looks as dick gets to his feet and moves to confront penny
penny lanes eyes fill and she runs out
and sees william also stand
william turns and follows her
russell stands watching and does not leave
we hear elton johns mona lisas and mad hatters
william exits as a crush of partygoers arrives
he doesnt know where she is
he takes off to examine the cabs stuck in traffic
he looks in the backs of cabs
none of them her
he runs down the streets looking for her
alone in new york city
william on the house phone
emily rugburn please
william approaches suite
the door is open
he hears new band voices and sees new faces
musician intercepts him
im a friend of penny lanes
arent we all musician types are leaving
where is she
room service arrives
some appetizers and a large expensive bottle of champagne on ice
can somebody sign for this
room service guy contd thank you mr
two more musicans english exit the back room party
the room is clearing out
lets get out of here
she used to be so much more together
william watches all champagne in hand and finds her in the backroom
shes addled and nearly passed out
im not good at goodbyes
he grabs the phone
penny lane contd youre the last of my old time friends
polexia went to england with deep purple
can you believe that
even sapphires out someplace else
all she left was her quaaludes
into phone front desk
please send a doctor
both rooms either room
this is mr
my wifes had an accident with some quaaludes
yes ill do that
the room has emptied out
just them and the remnants of a movable party that has moved elsewhere
william contd wake up
he struggles to get her on her feet
she tips over on her strappy platform shoes
he struggles to untie them
the school band plays colour my world
school principal at the podium
out graduating class
a peppy student bounds up and grabs her diploma
elaine miller watches dolefully in the audience
william holds penny in his arms
finally she is close to him
warm applause for another student who grabs his diploma
he takes off his mortar board to flash an american flag bandana
he raises his diploma in victory
william holds penny lane and keeps her moving
its a sagging messy slow dance
in the unlikely event of a water landing
you will be required to wear a safety vest
please place all stowable luggage in the overhead compartments
out in the seat in front of you
prompting seat and tray tables
and seat backs and tray tables should be in their full and upright and locked positions
out pending graduates
pause william miller
elaine applauds her son stoically
it is a dagger through her heart
a sympathetic look from a nearby mother continues the pain
they move slowly shes fading
in the tragic event of a water landing
the principal shares a few thoughts and to the class of we say beat dont forget to remember yourself as you are today
full of hope
and the dream that everything is possible
remember this twenty years from now when we all own home computers and we all travel in shiny electrical cars that move swiftly high above the city
beat they key to the future is keeping today alive forever
elaines head lowers slowly in a sea of happy parents
the day will never end
deegan slips into the seat next to her
release the guilt
elaine nods second please let there be only two because i cant get past number one
leave a little room for the other teachers in this world
hes out there looking for mentors
hes got twelve of them
theyre lined up
hes just tired of me
william holds penny
she is very woozy
you will be required to
gives up im tired
she is very groggy as he holds her
now that i have your attention
and you may not remember this later i just want to make it clear that
she blinks barely awake again i know youve heard this before
and i have never said this to anybody not really well nobody who didnt legally have to say it back to me but tries to be casual i love you
and i have a hard time sharing you with all of rock and roll because i why am i nervous
youll never remember this hey
she blinks i love you and im about to boldly go where
many men have gone before
he kisses her
a doctor and nurse come crashing into the room
they push past william and pull penny into the bathroom
he sits on the edge of the bed looking into the bathroom as they work on her
we hear stevie wonder
my cherie amor
doctor places a tube down penny lanes throat
a bored nurse holds a water bag lowering it to ground level
her feet sticking out wriggling
he watches as music continues
her amber colored stomach contents look like a jackson pollack portrait of the era with three partially dissolved pills
doctor hands enter frame and remove them
the doctor re appears and sits down next to william as the nurse exits
the doctor withdraws a three page report form
your wife will be okay for now thank you doctor
however she says youre her brother
eyes report shes a little confused
the ice shifts in the champagne bucket nearby
the doctor sizes up the situation
i dont have a drivers license
tomorrows my wedding anniversary
id prefer to take care of this without facing the dawn at the police station
so if you can find a way to get this girl your wife back home to her parents id let you pay me anything you can afford
because you dont appear to be related to the famous rugburns of rhode island
his eyes flick to the champagne
the kid takes a hint reaches over to the champagne
the doctor puts the champagne in his bag
she wont be good company but keep her awake for another four hours
william and penny drag themselves through the airport
he guides her to the ticket counter
penny wears her green coat large sunglasses
he sorts through her many partial tickets
they are both so tired
she shakes off her coat shes suddenly very hot and he grabs it and loops it through her bags
shes irritable and ready to go home
baring her soul when i was my mom and her boyfriend took me to a rolling stones concert and i freaked out and i rushed up to the front of
the stage and then a thousand people had the same idea at the same time and i was getting crushed
and i couldnt breathe and that thought flashed through me almost like a car accident i thought i might die
and it was in the middle of midnight rambler and keith richards saw me
and he came over and came to the front of the stage and he pulled me out
and they took me backstage and they gave me coke with ice and a and a lemon
and i never went home
what about your mom
she always said marry up
marry someone grand
thats why she named me lady
horrified she named you lady
you never really get used to it either
well this this just explains everything
he wishes it did
she rubs her stomach
its a rocky morning
william contd see you back in the real world
see you back there
she kisses his forehead and takes off down the accordian leading to her plane
she drops her coat again bending down to retrieve it
four woman turn but not penny
penny lane settles into her seat on the airplane
she notices william watching from the terminal window and waves
please extinguish all flammable items and return all seats and tray tables to their full and upright locked positions
she mouths along with the words
there is no one to share the joke with
and then a few blurry memories come back to her
she gestures to him
understanding him more fully
as he disappears
william walks alongside her plane moving from terminal window to terminal window
catching her glance again hes picking up steam
whats she saying
she keeps watching as he runs alongside still keeping up with her plane
she now fully remembers and places her outstretched fingers on the window
she mouths the words ill see you back home
he us running through her fingers
who can run no further
russell and william are in mid interview
the kids microphone is out
its a little bit of a rough flight
william wears the same clothes
why didnt you come back to the party
bob dylan showed up
he was sitting at our table for
had to be an hour right
i kept looking for you
i was going to introduce you
the kid feels pain
what happened to you last night
its a log story
a sharp jolt of turbulence
russell begins pounding on the card table in rhythm
singing buddy holly peggy sure
pretty pretty pretty pretty peggy sue
a moment of laughter and then bam
jeffs drink rises and suspends briefly in mid air
the plane takes another mighty knock
we shouldnt be here
doris we miss you
fear is creeping in around the edges
william already an uneasy flier looks down
this is craig your pilot
it appears weve caught the edge of that electrical storm we were trying to outrun
buckle up tight now
were gonna do our best to getcha out of this
the rocking of the plane worsens as all buckle up
strapping in for a roller coaster rock and roll
the sky darkens abruptly
william looks up increasingly nervous stares straight ahead
the plane suddenly drops and stabilizes
everyone is silent but russell
russell contd wooooooo baby
a moment later an ashen faced co pilot emerges balancing himself with hands on the ceiling of the shuddering plane
were gonna try to land in tupelo
were going to have to cut the inside lighting for the next several minutes
we found a field to land in
the kid notices silent ed is rubbing a small crucifix
i cant breathe
push in on russell
we hear a series of unfamiliar electrical sounds
the plane screwballs through the sky
it might be a rough set down
we should be fine
cracking at the edges but what we do say in a situation like this is we would pass but before the plane
however god help us if theres anything you want to say to each other any secrets anything like that now would be a good time
but just hang in there
well get you out of this
he returns to the cockpit
the weather worsens as the hail suddenly pelts the plane and it comes down hard
inside lights shut off
william stares straight ahead as the cockpit door swings open total chaos visible inside and then shuts again
and everyone thinks its so glamorous out here
oddly detached he just told us were gonna die
insecurities running wild were gonna crash in elvis hometown shut up
we cant even die in an original city
cmon dennis get us a better city
another sheet of hail hits the plane
oh my god
nearly in tears
if something should happen
i love all of you
i dont think we have to do the secrets thing
the plane shakes
now lightening strikes very close
a flashing wall of electricity rolls through the plane and evaporates with a burning smell still in the air
in the darkness i once hit a man in dearborn michigan
a hit and run
i hit him and kept on going
i dont know if hes alive or dead but im sorry
gripped with fear oh my god
the plane wildly rises and falls
it stops for a moment
a strange smooth patch
i love you all too and youre my family
especially since marna left me
but if i ever took an extra dollar or two here and there it was because i knew id earned it
slept with marna dick
i did too
i waited until you broke up with her
but me too
i also slept with leslie when you were fighting
slept with jeff
yes but it didnt count
it was the summer we decided to be free of all rules
to jeff and you say you love me
the truth i dont love you man
i never did
none of us love you
you act above us
you always have
you just held it over us like you light leave
like were lucky to be with you
and we had to live with it
i had to live with you and now i might die with you and its not fucking fair
william watches catatonic
to larry and ed you hate me
larry stares at him
ed says nothing
russell contd all this love
all this loyalty
incredulous giddy and you dont even like me
and im still in love with you leslie
the plane is pulling sideways and dropping altitude
i dont want to hear anymore
to jeff whatever happens youre dead
dont be self righteous russell not now
you were sleeping with penny that groupie
last summer and up until yesterday
why dont you tell leslie that
russell tries to get up and attack him
the force keeps him in his seat
freaking out i quit
the turbulence worsens
william finds his mouth saying emotional words he cannot control
she was a band aid
all she did was love your band
and you all you used her all of you
you used her and threw her away
she almost died last night while you were with bob dylan
youre always talking about the fans the fans the fans
she was your biggest fan and you threw her away
and if you cant see that thats your biggest problem
russell and jeff stare at each other
the plane is rocking very very hard
leslie is crying
they all turn to the silent drummer
its his first spoken dialogue of the movie
the plane pops out from below the clouds
sunshine spikes through the embattled windows of the plane as they float downwards to the city of tupelo mississippi
a very very uneasy silence fills the plane
no one can look at each other
out bursts the co pilot giddy with victory
thank god above were alive
were shot of all the occupants ending with russell
suddenly the alternative seems far more attractive
we hear rod stewarts jos lament as music plays over their still shocked faces
music continues as they walk together like ghosts in a long and very pregnant silence ignoring the kid
everything is different now
the kid peels off and throws up in a dumpster
we continue with the band unhappily moving forward
william hustles back to catch up
they ignore him
there are much bigger thoughts in play
no one wants to speak
well i think we can build on this new honesty
russell attacks him and theyre pulled apart
the band continues moving forward arriving at a fork in the airport terminals
this is where he must part company
he stands at the mouth of the next terminal as the band continues unaware hes split off
he watches their backs theyve forgotten him
then russell turns sensing something missing
all now stop and turn
still shell shocked they summon a pre occupied but heartfelt goodbye
williams finger finds san francisco
the kid checks the address as he arrives at the mjb building and its next door neighbor the san francisco headquarters of rolling stone magazine
he still wears the same clothes from last night in new york
william arrives at the front desk gets the once over from a friendly receptionist a paragon of new cool
leave your package at the desk
im not a messenger
im one of your writers
he is zombie tired with heavy duffel case and his orange bag
william walks down the center aisle
editors and writers look at him standing at the front of their cubicles to see this exhausted year old writer
at the end of the aisle like a human finish line stand ben fong torres
youre william miller
the secret emerges not with a bang but with a slight and tired nod of the head
putting it all together oh baby
ben leads him into the office of jann wenner the editor publisher
editors are feverishly discussing the next issue
the big concerns of a national magazine are in the air
everyone is focused and quick
the conversation is machine gun like
jann werner turns to the kid
we cant run this piece
the kids eyes travel to his story a stack of fuzzy looking sheets on the table
you obviously saw more than you wrote about
after eight days on the road with these guys
didnt anything happen
and where are you in this piece
what did you want to write
because this reads like what they wanted you to write
what happened to your highly touted think piece on limitations of a middle level band in the face of success
william sits speechless
its sinking in
conversation continues at a fast pace we can push up chets who cover good cause its going to take me three days to get through this research
its all handwritten on little slips
plus they all refer to woman as chicks
i mean as a woman i have a problem with that
i know its a side issue
sympathetic loquacious its a puff piece
you fell for em
a relationship forms
you want them to like you
wistful chewing cigarette holder happened with me and charlie manson
he was a very charming
felton catches himself swooning
the other are staring at him
he snaps out of it
david felton contd mass murderer
please let me finish it
give me tonight to work on it
chets piece is all fact checked and ready
to william get some sleep
well do another story sometime
well get you a kill fee
his research is all on little bits of paper
did i say that
you told me to send what i had
its not finished
thats being charitable
ben looks at the kid then at jann
jann scans the kids face for a beat nods
let him use the big office
its where hunter used to write
william rises gratefully
he shakes janns hand
pointed re his age you can type
it took it in grade school
william sits in the big office
its a small white tank
after all the sound and fury there is only the hum of a large electric typewriter
his research transcripts and some band photos sit nearby
he takes a bite of a candy bar a sip of coffee
he looks at the phone
crazy jazz is playing
lester bangs on the phone
you made friends with them
see friendship is the booze they feed you
they want you to get drunk on feeling like you belong
william in the empty rolling stone office
ruefully well it was fun
they make you feel cool
i met you
you are not cool
even when i though i was i knew i wasnt
thats because we are uncool
and while women will always be a problem for guys like us most of the great art in the world is about that very problem
good looking people have no spine
their art never lasts
they get the girls but were smarter
i can really see that now
yeah great art is about conflict and pain and guilt and longing and love disguised as sex and sex disguised as love
and lets face it you got a big head start
im glad you were home
im always home
leveling the only true currency in this bankrupt world if what we share with someone else when were uncool
distraught i feel better my advice to you
i know you think those guys are your friends
you want to be a true friend to them
william takes a deep breath
looks at the research cassettes and notebooks
the empty page
be honest and unmerciful
beat youre doing great
call me later is you want
im always up
ben fong torres and david felton look at williams new manuscript with great interest
read me the opening line
reads aloud i am flying high over tupelo mississippi with americas hottest band and we are all about to die
as if sampling wine dark
yeah and it gets better
impressed did this all really happen
william sleeps restlessly nearby mouth agape sitting upright in a plastic chair
jealously reaches for manuscript give it to me
ill call and check the quotes
the band rides in a new tour bus
the palpable tone in the air is panic
lets just piece together our information
because the fact checker asked us all about different parts of the story
what did he write about
whats he using
hes using it all
beat we come off like amateurs
some average band
trying to come to grips jealous and fighting and breaking up were buffoons
maybe we just dont see ourselves the way we really are
he was supposed to be our friend
ruefully remembering i told him to write what he wanted
all eyes look to russell
to russell by the way he has you on acid screaming i am a golden god from a fans rooftop
immediately remembering oh my god
they used him to fuck us
still back at golden god i didnt say golden god
or did i
we never took him seriously and now its serious
i liked him as a person
he was never a person
he was a journalist
he looks at silent ed drumming soundlessly on a rubber pad
you had the right idea all along
ed silently nods thanks
nervously how about the plane flight
its all in there
but dont worry its all unspecific who say what
no names are mentioned in the more embarrassing sequences its just completely obvious whos who
i forgot he was there
well they havent talked to russell he can always deny the key stuff to the fact checker
then they cant print it
brightening is that true
its war my friend
if youd met me earlier he would have never been on the around
dennis hands russell the phone
dennis hope contd hell live
william is still being congratulated by his new peers
we see him woozy but beaming as allison the fact checker comes out of her office waving the manuscript
she works her way through the cluster of editors
the band just denied of the story
its a fabrication
everyone looks at william who is speechless and confused
their congratulations stop on a dime
the fact checker cant resist twisting the knife a little
fact checker contd you werent honest
and worse you wasted our time
did you talk to russell
russell hammond is the one who denied it
one last shot to william were going with the who
the kid has been sandbagged
the machine of a big time magazine whirs into action on another story as the cluster moves down the hall
hes just some fan
what did you expect
william sits there as only david felton stay behind brandishing his cigarette holder
he sits down next to the kid
well i believe you
he looks at the kid decides to offer a personal parable
felton contd jim morrison once came to my house and drank a beer
the beer is still on my mantle
im years old with jim morrisons beer as a shrine
i wanted to be earnest hemingway
i have jim morrisons beer
shrugs hes learned to live with it if you didnt make your story up good for you
if you did make it up
good for you
the kid looks at him too tired and still in shock
felton contd say something so i know youre alive
russell hammond sits down on a plastic chair with a paper plate filled with buffet style food steak and baked potato
preoccupied and several seats away from other crew members
he drinks a glass of milk
out old friend sapphire takes the seat next to him holding a skimpy paper plate of vegetables
i feel bad
well at least you feel
that puts you in a higher class of asshole
they eat in silence
sapphire looks around
the new breed of groupies eye her as they cruise russell on the periphery
theyre bolder flashier
she eyes them back with seniority
what did i do
well you can do what the big boys do
he looks at her nothing
the girls still circle russell nearby
you believe these new girls
none of em take birth control and they eat all the steak
she looks sadly at her plate of vegetables
an ever sharp mind in last nights clothes she commands russells respect
sapphire contd they dont even know what it id to be a fan
to blindly love some silly piece of music
or some band so much that it hurts
please theyre all just after the money
shoo in their direction go rob a bank
its more honest
is penny okay
the quaalude incident
yeah it wasnt pretty
she could have died
i always warned her about letting too many guys fall in love with her
i guess i was wrong
shrugs on of em saved her life
well its finally over with leslie
im going to call her
let her retire
he doesnt respond you want to lock her up in a house in michigan
he doesnt respond write her a song someday
she deserves it
something about that girl brought out the best in a lot of
looks around backstage pretty average people
she deserves it
russell stares into his crew meal nodding a little
sapphire contd forward thinking because something tells me twenty years from now well remember her
and not much else
russell smiles to himself knows its true
dick passes placing hands on russells shoulders massaging a little
have a good vacation
i hope the band stays together
before it all went down the shitter it was starting to get really good
dick claps russell on the back and moves on
he turns to sapphire
im not going to blame myself
i do make people happy
they just shouldnt get to know me
cause it appears to spoil everything
dont be so easy on yourself
what gives you the right to get this personal with me
lets not reminisce
william moves like a zombie through the airport and collapses in a seat
he sits still in the crowded flow of human traffic
a cluster of flight attendants pass
one stops a stylish young woman wearing a tall bubble shaped psa hat with swirling colors
he looks at her
he feels like hes on mars and she looks like a martian
anita contd you guys this is my brother
ad if meeting a celebrity the narc
william looks woefully at them like a dog whos been hit by a car
you guys ill deadhead back later
i think im needed
nice to finally meet you
you have a good day
anita looks in her brothers face
you look awful but thats great
youre living your life
youre finally free of
ill take off work
lets have an adventure together
you and me finally
anywhere you want to go
anywhere in the world
william whistles the family whistle
sister and brother trudge up the steps
this is not my idea of a good time
just get me to my bed
resigned ill deal with her
william whistles again
mom meets them at the door
she looks at her trashed son who has finally come home
for the first time she hugs anita first and its not lost on anita
its a clumsy neck hug neither wanting to commit
the kid passes to his mothers left with suitcase intentionally nudging her into his sister
anita takes this as an aggressive act of love and hugs her mother back
tears stream down moms face
their cheeks touch
mom pulls away and sees her own tears on anitas face
thinking that shes also crying she grabs a tissue for them both
the kid stands in the hallway listening shaking his head poised to enter his room unseen by them
so worried what are we going to do about him
i dont know
whatever happened to him i just wish it could have happened to me
the magazine killed his story
now they really hug anita gulping back real tears
william watches them bonding over the oddest thing his failure
william goes into the bedroom the final three feet to sleep and shuts the door
a hand places a hotel sign on the door do not disturb
slight push in
he collapses with all his clothes on almost instantly asleep
his walls just as he left them boast a pantheon of rock heroes
with a very lonely abraham lincoln or atticus finch in the center
the elevator doors ding open and out walks russell hammond
the secretary has just finished answering the phone straight arrow publishers
she puts the caller on hold
hi im russel hammond
youre here regarding
russell stands with the editors observing the fine portraits on the walls
hes behind enemy lines and he knows it
everything in the room fascinates him
i dont care what happens
i dont care if you put us on the cover
but you sent us a kid and
and he was a fan
and we all made friends with him absolutely to get a good story
but then we actually liked him
we thought hes
show us our lives in some mythic way and i guess
were not mythic
you denied most of the story
yeah well heres the problem with the truth
its too true well we appreciate the visit
the last time an artist came here it was buddy miles and he punched me
im not punching anybody
i am personally as of pm yesterday on a voyage of self reinvention
this is about william miller
counting off fingers he lives with us he lost his virginity he saw us at our worst appreciated our best he saved two lives including mine
he smuggled about a half pound of pot into boston and we never even told him nearby david felton looks at another editor raising an eyebrow
russell contd we told him too much we told him everything
he almost died with us over tupelo
if the band survives him itll be a miracle
but you know he tried to keep up and thats a journalist to me
its too late
were going with a different cover
immediately thank god
but russell looks around at the numerous portraits if dead legendary rock stars fixing on the one photo closest to all of them a very vulnerable looking janis joplin
a second thought
russell contd you tell me its too late
but i could go back to my hotel room and
tonight and something tells me youd find a way to put me on the cover of the next issue
am i right
he looks at their faces
they cannot disagree
russell contd im learning the game
beat shrug we fucked up
we made friends with him
next time well all be more professional
beat an odd thought but god forbid the day comes when selling yourself is as important as the music you make
rueful to hendrix on the wall you might have died at the right time my friend
thank you for visiting
do what you want but the story is true
at the entrance
raises his hand
russell contd good evening
russell stands outside a traveling man with no where to go
oddly and in a way that surprises him the world begins to speak to him again
little noises everywhere turning into a music of its own
its a beautiful and compelling silence
he thrusts his hands deep in his pockets and takes a breath of life
his head filling again with the music of the world he begins to walk down the street
very naturally and quite randomly he is noticed by young passersby
they cant help it
he looks like a star
they cant quite figure out who it is but its someone and they begin to follow him down the street
unbeknownst to him as he walks along deep in thought a small crowd begins to form
a quiet kitchen
anita has been cooking
a substantial breakfast has been placed on the table
sausage orange juice
and now anita sets down a plate of pancakes with syrup and butter in front of her mother
william watches his mother facing an old enemy white sugar
theyre called pancakes
who knows when well be together again
its what most people call breakfast
mom looks at her children and takes a breath
i went through your records
and i found a song to play for you
she goes to the stereo and puts on a record
the two children eye each other whats coming next
song to be chosen the two kids eye each other again
self consciously avoiding their gaze mom sits and toys with her breakfast
its a song she clearly wants them to hear
its a song from the heart
they look at her amazed
elaine looks up regards her family
somehow theyre back at this table
they continue eating breakfast
a bundle of bound rolling stone magazines lands on the newsstand pavement with a thud
someone reaches in to cut the cord as the magazines puff up into view
its the new issue with russell hammond on the cover
the title stillwater runs deep
just another stack of magazines waiting to be places in the racks
music segues to led zeppelins four sticks
penny lanes sleeping polaroid shots of our characters featuring a few self portraits
