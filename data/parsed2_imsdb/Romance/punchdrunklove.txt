on the phone barry egan adam sandler yes im still on hold
and what was this
im looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway
this is fly with us
its hard to understand because it says in addition to but i cant exactly understand in addition to what because theres actually nothing to add it too
i think thats a type o then that would be a mistake
so just to clarify im sorry ten purchases of any of your healthy choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one
thousand miles thats it
do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases
i dont know
i mean i dont know
distant screaming is heard
barry hears this gets distracted then back to the phone call can i call you back if i have any further questions
can i get your extension
its extension if you want to try me back
he hangs up the phone and walks through his warehouse
its fairly non descript place boxing materials etc
products seem to be mainly silly novelties pens that light up key chains novelty toilet plungers etc he lifts a loading door and light pours inside washes out the frame
camera follows him out
stays overexposed and over his shoulder as he looks down towards the street
his business is situated at the end of a common driveway shared with a few other nondescript places and an auto mechanic
distant sound of a car speeding and skidding
hold then a jeep cherokee comes flipping into frame far off at the mouth of the alley on the street
the jeep ends up landing right side up
barry flinches a little stares
the jeep sits idle for a moment
then it drives off
then a speeding small toyota comes into view at the mouth of the alley screeching to a halt
the passenger side door opens and a small wooden harmonium like a portable organ is placed on the ground
the toyota speeds away
a moment or two later another non descript car flies past very fast
barry squints looks at the small harmonium sitting alone in the middle of the street
he hesitates looks around holds then walks back inside his warehouse
barry on the phone again im not exactly sure what that means
if they break or something
what is it plastic
its a plastic yeah
alright lemme call you first thing tomorrow im gonna run the numbers see whats what and ill give you a call back did you have my home phone number
if you wanted to call me back i could
im fine i have your work number
because of the time difference if you needed to call me early
i can just get you at your office
ok bye bye
he hangs up the phone and walks outside camera follows him again out to the alley over his shoulder
he looks down the length of the alley at the harmonium
hold then a small ford escort pulls into the driveway around the harmonium parks
a young woman named lena leonard emily watson exits the car and starts to walk down the length of the alley towards him
camera stays over his shoulder and turns into a profile shot hi
do you work at the mechanic
theyre not open yet
they dont get opened until eight
barry gently steps back and out of the frame
is it ok if i leave my car you think
i dont know
i thought they opened at seven
beat if i left my car would it be ok
i dont know
do you know them
not very well
can i ask you can i trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them

i think thatll be fine
lena hands him her keys he steps back into frame then theres a piano in the street
maybe ill see you later
thank you for your help
maybe ill see you later when i pick up my car
she walks away
he starts back inside the warehouse hesitates watches her go
right before she reaches the end of the alley she glances back quickly over her shoulder
he dodges inside real quick
hold the empty frame
then he steps back out
looks off at the harmonium
and the empty street
he looks around some more
then he makes the long walk down the street
barry stares at the harmonium a little bit looks around both ways then casually picks it up and walks back towards his business
he brings it into his office and places it on his desk
he tries a few keys
theres no sound
he presses his hand on the foot pedal and presses a key and a small note is made
he does it again
and holds the note
barry enters the warehouse with harmonium and runs into his office
he places it on the desk and hits a key no sound
barry goes to his knees and unlatched the bellows
he pumps the bellow reaches up presses a note and another
then stands up into cu
and presses the note melody
suddenly the sound of the pod bay door sliding
barry spins around scared shitless sees lance who enters the warehouse barry rushes out to greet him hey good morning barry
yes im fine

i thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work can i show you something

they enter into the office lance sees the harmonium what is this

lance walks around behind the harmonium
leaving barry alone
towards the warehouse
he starts to back up a little

sal ernesto and rico all start to come into work behind barry
he sees them camera pushes in on barry

dean takes a beer bottle and smashes it in half on the bar holds it up to the guy theyre all walking towards a back room of the bar they
walk past a couple that is fighting
the woman is screaming at the top of her lungs at the man dean gets in the middle of it take it easy take it easy you guys in here
i need to talk to you later tommy i wanna know if you wanna book the boys he motions over his shoulder to ashes to ashes
ill talk to you later
they enter into an upstairs office area
it has a couple desks and off to the side in a small partitioned off room is the phone sex area a girl on the phone
we hear bits of her call e
im in florida
laying on my bed
there are posters for ashes to ashes filing cabinets posters of cars lots of various small business items like order forms and pamphlets etc
dean collects a piece of paper and hands it to david nate jim your expenses are your own
i thought latisha said you would she didnt know what she was talking about its
thats not cool
it doesnt make sense if you think about it in a fair deal like sense
one hundred dollars for two days work is a lot more than your family is making sitting around your house
im serious now
he hands him a set of keys and goes through the info keys for the track
you have to gas it up and save the receipts on that
we have a business address too if you need that but hit him at his house first see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up
give him a little doe see doe uch
shut up dean
whats the problem
you dont need to talk all macho shake him out little bad boy
whatever youre not an action hero tough guy youre not a gangster he makes a very sudden and quick move towards her and she flinchy
thats what i thought
to greg call me when you see this guy check him out see whats what
she asked him for seven fifty when she was on the phone with him so just call me when you get there
he hands him another piece of paper and a photo this is this place called ace vintage you gotta find it i dont know exactly where this is and i
dont understand these maps so just go there and check it out
its a ac cobra that this old guy says is fine but i need to figure out why hes only asking for it
so take a look the whole thing call me about that if it seems alright then ill head down there and check it out
can we maybe ask for more money on this
because its california
i mean its like a nine or ten hour drive
its not like going to salt lake and getting the mormons its different
after a long long staring contest with david dean suddenly and very violently puts his fist through the wall
then turns to david
latisha rolls her eyes
david nate and jim leave
camera behind the heads of nate jim dave as they drive down the street
they call their brother mike d on the phone and say whats up were goin to los angeles you wanna go
camera pans left and picks up the fourth brother mike d as he walks from work and gets in the car
camera holds behind the heads of the four blonde brothers as they drive off
this is a split screen sequence shot with two cameras
the left side of the screen holds lena
she waits in her small nondescript apartment doing the things you do while waiting for someone else
she sits stands sits stands
the right side of the the screen travels steadicam with barry as he walks into the reception area
there is a security guard black female who asks him his name where hes going and to sign in
the security guard calls up to lenas place
and we watch lena answer the phone
the security guard gives barry some very complicated directions
we follow lead barry as he makes his way through the maze up elevators down corridors looking for lenas apartment
finally he arrives knocks who is it
as she opens the door the split screen slides away and the images give way to the one of lena standing hi
lena and barry at a table
they talk see notes
so i want to tell you something i gotta tell you i saw a picture of you guys your sisters and you and i saw your picture and i really
wanted to meet you
beat i came to drop my car off there on purpose to try and meet you
barry leans a little bit out of frame
are you lying
i thought i should tell you
i didnt want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something beat
he leans slightly back in frame
thats very nice
thank you for saying that
beat youre friends with my sister
how long have you known her
about six months
you like her
yeah we get along well
beat you didnt get along with her very well
did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that
beat ive been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways cross promotional work by some companies
do you remember all that pudding
so that pudding was bought i bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion thats sponsored by healthy choice and american airlines
its designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying healthy choice products
they make frozen meals deli meats pasta sauce breads soups and ice creams this sort of thing
i lost my thoughts what i was saying
you were talking about the promotion the promotion says buy any healthy choice products and get miles of airline travel or for purchases made with a special coupon
so in the supermarket you notice their products first you notice they have a teriyaki chicken dinner at
thats a pretty good deal
but then i noticed they had soup at cents a can
and you start to do the math and you start to notice that its a really amazing deal because i stumbled across the pudding at cents a cup
now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label
thats those little bar codes you know
the universal product codes
thats whats used to redeem the mileage so in noticing the pudding each cup had an individual bar code in other words two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups
of pudding is miles
add in the coupon its one thousand
yeah no i see you see if you spent dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles
that is really really crazy
thats just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding
so that was your pudding
i thought you said no i didnt say that
i thought you said you bought all that pudding my friend carlos is doing it who works with me
its his pudding hes doing it
its not mine
i told him not to do it
hes the one whos insane
he only spent about one hundred dollars so far though your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you when you guys were kids and you were building
a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window
is that right
you threw a hammer through a sliding glass door
barry starts to well with tears which he hides very quickly holds a hand up to his face as if hes touching his nose and then he smiles i dont
remember that she might be lying
i have to go the bathroom
he gets up and goes
barry walks in and goes a little crazy
hes mad at himself and he hits a stall
it seems loose already and falls straight to the floor
this makes him go crazier and he continues to beat and kick the shit out of the bathroom stall
he collects himself and then he hesitates looks around tries to collect the bathroom but its in ruins he exits
barry comes back and sits down seems a little better
tries to be a little flirtatious for half a moment before the manager comes over leans in carefully hello
sir can i talk to you
just have you for one second please
he looks to lena excuses himself
the manager and barry step away in a quiet section of the restaraunt shot profile in sotto slow zoom in
sir the bathroom was just torn apart

he starts to move back
