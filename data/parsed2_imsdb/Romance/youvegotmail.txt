youve got mail youve got mail by nora ephron delia ephron based on the shop around the corner by nikolaus laszlo nd final white revised february we have a sense
of cyberspace travel as we hurtle through a sky thats just beginning to get light
there are a few stars but they fade and the sky turns a milky blue and a big computer sun starts to rise
we continue hurtling through space and see that were heading over a computer version of the new york city skyline
we move over central park
its fall and the leaves are glorious reds and yellows
we reach the west side of manhattan and move swiftly down broadway with its stores and gyms and movies theatres and turn onto a street in the west s
hold in front of a new york brownstone
at the bottom of the screen a small rectangle appears and the words as the rectangle starts to fill with color we see a percentage increase from to
when it hits the image pops and we are in real life
early morning in new york
a couple of runners pass on their way to riverside drive park
we go through the brownstone window into kathleen kelly is asleep
kathleen is as pretty and fresh as a spring day
her bedroom cozy has a queen sized bed and a desk with a computer on it
bookshelves line every inch of wall space and overflow with books
framed on the childrens classic
as kathleen wakes up her boyfriend frank navasky walks into the room
he wears blue jeans and a workshirt
hes carrying the new york times
as he reads listen to this the entire work force of the state of virginia had to have solitaire removed from their computers kathleen gets out of bed and goes
to brush her teeth in the bathroom and we stay with frank
continuing because they hadnt done any work in six weeks
kathleen comes out of the bathroom in her robe
arent you late
continuing you know what this is you know what were seeing here
were seeing the end of western civilization as we know it
this is so sad
she tosses him his jacket
points at her computer you think that machine is your friend but its not
checks his watch im late
as frank walks to the apartment door
we see a charming room with a couch fireplace books and a dining table with a typewriter with a cover on it
ill see you tonight
frank goes out the door
kathleen tiptoes into the hall and looks through the fish eye peephole watching as he goes down the stairs disappearing from sight
she walks into and looks out the front window as frank walks out onto the street and turns toward broadway
she sits down at her computer
an expression of anticipation and guilty pleasure as she clicks the mouse
as we see the logo for america on line come up and kathleens code name shopgirl
she logs on and the computer makes all its little modem noises as the computer dials the access number and connects and we hear the machine welcome
and we see kathleen listening for the words shes waiting to hear computer contd youve got mail
and kathleen smiles as her mail page comes up we see a list of letters big cash op you can make in your spare time
oil mkt you can turn into this really works u can do it maximize your selling ability nowwwww
ny brinkley kathleen hits the delete key and the first three letters all of them junk mail are deleted and drop offscreen
then she selects the read mail key for ny brinkley
and the letter comes up to shopgirl from ny re brinkley kathleen starts to read the letter aloud brinkley is my dog
he loves the streets of new york as much as i do and now we hear kathleens voice replaced by the voice of ny a man named joe fox although
he likes to eat bits of pizza and bagel off the sidewalk and i prefer to buy them
brinkley is a great catcher and was offered a tryout on the mets farm team continued a dog is sitting on a large green pillow on the floor
this is brinkley
the pillow has brinkley embroidered on it
brinkleys master joe fox a great looking guy full of charm and irony comes into the kitchen and pours himself some orange juice
hes half dressed
joe contd but he chose to stay with me so that he could spend hours a day sleeping on a large green pillow the size of an inner tube
dont you love new york in the fall
it makes me want to buy school supplies
i would send you a bouquet of newly sharpened pencils if i knew your name and address
on the other hand this not knowing has its charms
darling mmmmmhmmm joes girlfriend patricia eden in armani head to toe comes into the kitchen and turns on the espresso machine which starts grinding beans
shes carrying the morning papers
indicating the newspaper random house fired dick atkins
murray chilton died
which makes one less person im not speaking to she drains a cup of espresso as a second starts to come out of the machine vince got a great review
hell be insufferable
tonight pen dinner am i going
cant i just give them money
thats the cause
free albanian writers
im for that
patricia drains another cup of espresso looks at him
all right ill go
i know i know i know
she tears out of the kitchen and the door slams behind her
hold on joe listening as he hears the elevator door open and close on the landing outside
as he comes in and sits down at his laptop computer and logs on
youve got mail
and as he starts to read his letter we hear i like to start my notes to you as if were already in the middle of a conversation
i pretend that were the oldest and dearest friends as opposed to what we actually are people who dont know each others names and met in a chat room where
we both claimed wed never been before
as joe dressed for work takes the elevator down with his elevator man charlie
theres a certain amount of good morning etc
as the elevator goes down and the voice over continues what will he say today i wonder
i turn on my computer i wait impatiently as it boots up
as joe comes out of his building
i go on line and my breath catches in my chest until i hear three little words youve got mail
and the camera now pans from riverside uptown to i hear nothing not even a sound on the streets of new york just the beat of my own heart
i have mail
as kathleen comes onto broadway at the corner of rd street and starts downtown
through a long lens we can see joe walking into blocks behind her
as kathleen and joe make their way down broadway we see the west side of manhattan in the morning
mothers and fathers taking their kids to school people on their way to work dogs being walked
school buses picking up kids bakery trucks dropping off brown bags of bread in the doorframes of unopened restaurants
kathleen stops at a newsstand says good morning to the newsstand dealer and picks up a new york times
metal grates are pulled up to open flower shops nail salons the pharmacy fish store the cuban chinese restaurant zabars
joe stops at the same newsstand
he buys all the papers the times wall street journal post and daily news
as kathleen picks up her coffee walks out
as kathleen walks down columbus we see joe a block behind her
she stops to buy flowers and joe passes her crosses to the ease side of columbus avenue
a building under construction with plywood board covering the front and wrapping around the corner
joe goes to a side entrance and enters
as kathleen comes around the corner onto rd and stops in front of her store a childrens bookstore called the shop around the corner
it is an irresistibly inviting store
there are twinkle lights in the windows framing large stuffed animals reading childrens books madeleine good night moon where the wild things are
a teddy bear in a pinafore is reading the stupids step out
waiting for kathleen in front is one of her employees christina
its a beautiful day
isnt it the most beautiful day
christina looks up at the sky as if seeing it for the first time
kathleen unlocks the shop and cranks the grate which rises making a horrible noise
two cabs almost collide in front of the store with a screech and one cabdriver starts yelling obscenities at the other
kathleen unlocks the door to the store
dont you love new york in the fall
christina looks at her puzzled
kathleen turns the closed sign on the door over to read open and she activates the computer system
she looks around and we see a small but charming childrens bookstore with wooden shelves a tiny area where kids can sit and read some charming posters and a glass
case full of first editions of the oz books and alice in wonderland etc
theres a playful display of witches lit with twinkle lights covered with orange pumpkin globes and a sign reading the ten best witch list and a collection of witch books
the lion the witch and the wardrobe the witches the wizard of oz
on the counter is a glass jar full of sugar free lollipops
kathleen hangs up her coat in the back of the store and suddenly stops to daydream
a smile creeps onto her face
christina looks at her
whats going on with you
youre in love
of course i am
im in love with frank
im practically living with frank
do you think you could get our christmas mailers out this week
by monday i promise
i have a paper due friday
now whats going on
she looks at kathleen im just going to stand here till you tell me
is it infidelity if youre involved with someone on e mail
have you had sex
of course not
i dont even know him
i mean cybersex
well dont do it
the minute you do they lose all respect for you
its not like that
we just e mail
its really nothing on top of which im definitely thinking of stopping because its getting out of hand
but not really
because its nothing
where did you meet him
i cant even remember
off christinas look the day i turned thirty i wandered into the over thirty room for a joke sort of and he was there and we started chatting
how much we both love new york
starts smiling bouquets of sharpened pencils
we dont talk about anything personal
we made a rule about that
i dont know his name what he does or exactly where he lives so it will be really easy to stop seeing him because im not
god he could be the next person to talk into the store
he could be
as george walks in george
george pappas in his twenties one of kathleens salespeople is a cute guy who has no idea that hes supposed to look in the mirror when he gets dressed
are you on line
as far as im concerned the internet is just another way to be rejected by a woman
birdie walks in
she is in her seventies has white hair and is tiny like a little sparrow
she is the stores oldest employee having worked there for over forty years and serves as a accountant as well as salesperson
good morning birdie
what are you all talking about
i tried to have cybersex once but i kept getting a busy signal
i know i know
one saturday night i was really depressed about not having a date so i thought no problemo ill go on line and i wont be lonely but i couldnt get
on there were hundreds of thousands of people who didnt have dates trying to get on
you have to wonder which is harder getting a date or getting on line when you dont have a date
getting a date is harder
we hear the bell jingle as two west side mothers come in with two kids in strollers
to the kids jessica and maia how are you today
we hear the sound of the garbage truck
kathleen goes out the front door to as the commercial garbage truck pulls up and two garbagemen start to load her trash
hey you forgot to pick up the garbage last week and i got a ticket
and youre late today i could have gotten another
we were here there was no garbage
of course there was what do you think i dont want to pick up garbage
you think i go up and down the street picking up garbage im not going to pick up yours
whats the matter with you
kathleen is standing there tongue tied
you dont even bundle it right youre supposed to bundle it and leave it near the curb you leave it near the store and you use cheap garbage bags they
smear all over the place and then i got to pick it up with my shovel as christina whos helping one of the customers looks out the window as the harangue continues
and now youre busting my chops
youre just another garbage pick up to us okay
as kathleen continues to stand there speechless
as kathleen comes back into the store
christina is ringing up a sale
that guy went ballistic on me
i hope you told him off
another customer enters the store
the bell jingles
a little truck carrying a knife sharpener its bells ringing passes the building under construction
workers electricians masons carpenters etc
in the process of building what looks like a large store
wires hanging everywhere
the electrical contractor called
his truck hit a deer last night he wont be in til tomorrow
the shelves are late because the shipment of pine had beetles
and theres some question about whether were installing the stairs in the right spot that sounds great
testing one two three four
is the electrician here
i just told you he hit a deer
i hear nothing
not a sound on the city streets just the beat of my own heart
i think thats the way it goes
something like that
beginning to glean something did you and patricia get engaged
are you crazy
i thought you liked patricia i love patricia
patricia makes coffee nervous
suddenly all business are we still on schedule
we open two weeks before thanksgiving
i guess we should announce ourselves soon
tell people were coming
this is the upper west side of manhattan
the minute they hear theyll be lining up to picket the big bad chain store that destroys everything we hold dear
but well seduce them with our square footage and our deep armchairs and our amazingly swift checkout lines and our discounts and our
the trump card cappuccino
they hate us in the beginning but we get them in the end
meanwhile we should just put up a sign coming soon a foxbooks superstore and the end of western civilization as we know it
joe is in the office with his father nelson fox and his grandfather schuyler fox
the office has been recently redecorated everything is new and a little overdone
on the wall we see the foxbooks logo
kevin and i are both a little concerned about the neighborhood response suddenly notices the garish couch what is this fabric
does it have a name
its name is money
gillian selected it
your father is getting married again
oh great congratulations dad
why does anyone get married
yes that is one reason
i think youre a damn fool
dad matthew is four
it would be nice for him if his parents were married
annabel is eight and im not married to her mother
i cant even remember her mothers name
he laughs merrily i have a very sad announcement to make
city books on rd street is going under nelson shuyler and joe high five each other
another independent bookstore bites the dust on to the next
and im buying their entire stock architecture new york history for the new store
how much are your paying
whatever it costs it wont be as much as this exquisite mohair episode
indicates the couch were also going to have a section on west side writers as a sop to the neighborhood
itll keep those west side liberal nut pseudo intellectual bleeding hearts readers
theyre called readers
dont romanticize them
itll keep them from jumping down your throat whats the competition
one mystery store
sleuth on th and amsterdam
and a childrens bookstore
the shop around the corner
been there forever
cecilia kelly lovely woman
i think we might have had a date once
or maybe we just exchange letters
you wrote her letters
it was called mail
fondly nostalgic and kidding it slightly stamps
ive heard of it
it was a means of communication before i was born
cecilia had beautiful penmanship
she was too young for me but she was
her daughter owns it now
too bad for her
as a decorator walks into the office carrying a pile of upholstered pillows and joe turns to look at them
youve got mail
my father is getting married again
for five years hes been living with a woman who studied decorating at caesars palace
youve got mail
kathleen looks up from her book as a butterfly flies through the subway car
once i read a story about a butterfly in the subway and today i saw one
i couldnt believe it
it got on at nd continued the train comes to a stop
the butterfly flies out
and got off at th where i assume it was going to bloomindales to buy a hat that will turn out to be a mistake
as almost all hats are
a flour truck is unloading flour into a hole in the ground
did you know that every night a truck pulls up to h h bagels and pumps about a ton of flour into the ground
the air is absolutely amazing
as joe comes around the corner and sees the dust filling the air
it is amazing
i guess ive read pride prejudice about times as joe reads a copy of pride and prejudice
he cant stand it
and every time i read it i worry that elizabeth and mr
darcy are not going to get together but the truth is whenever i think about my favorite book i always think about the books i read as a child as
kathleen takes a copy of homer price off the shelf
did you ever read homer price
my all time favorite childrens book
continued she opens it to the illustration of the doughnut machine that wont stop making doughnuts
contd theres a doughnut machine in it that wont stop making doughnuts they just keep coming down the chute just as regular as a clock can tick
have you been to krispy kreme
continued joe eating a doughnut looks through the window at the huge doughnut machine as the doughnuts roll down the chute just as regular as a clock can tick
contd theres a doughnut machine right in the window that makes dozen doughnuts an hour
as joe leaves with his morning coffee
joe goes to his painter at work coming soon is as far as hes gotten
she enters starbucks
as kathleen buys her morning coffee and listens to everyone ordering
we can hear the sounds of starbucks short decaf cap tall mocha latte
grande lowfat regular
the painter is further along on the sign
it now reads kathleen walks past the construction site
she doesnt really pay attention to the sign painter
we see two police cars barreling up th street followed by a television news truck
the police cars and tv truck barrel uptown
st street continuous they turn left onto west st and stop in front of an apartment building on the block
there are more police cars and a horde of television reporters with microphones etc
george emerges from the building as a newscaster broadcasts
the body of a woman was found this morning on the roof of a new york building
as george comes out of his building into a horde of reporters with microphones cameras etc
and listens to the reporter who seeing george sticks the microphone into his face
here is a resident of the building
your name please
did you see or hear anything unusual last night
i didnt go out
at that moment george sees a young woman
this is meredith carter
he is struck dumb
the victim was red haired about thirty five wearing a jogging suit
did you encounter anyone by that description in the building
george hasnt heard a word
have there been any wild parties lately
george doesnt answer
could it perhaps be one of your neighbors
george continues to stare at the beautiful woman
as he does she notices him
she stares back
the reporter ignored finally turns away
to camera as you can see no one here knows anything
he continues to stand there dumbstruck for a moment
meredith carter starts to walk away
as george walks along broadway past the sign which now says coming soon a foxbooks superstore
he sees it
kathleen and several customers in the store
george walks in and goes to the back to hang up his coat
christina is unpacking boxes
birdie is at the desk
george looks at christina meaningfully
totally mystified what
the coup de foudre i had one
i never believed in them but i just had one
is that the thing where you get cold suddenly bang
no thats the coup de vieux i had that
the coup de foudre is where you get love suddenly bang
i had that too
only i had it in seville where it was called el estruendo de amor i dont know her name or anything about her
i may never see her again
and if you ever do meet her youll find out all the horrible details and that will be that
shell turn out to have pictures of the virgin mary all over the walls
i wont care
kathleen sticks her head into the back
can someone help me out here
george had a coup de foudre and christinas making fun of me
dont let her
i believe in this i completely believe in this
it happened to madame bovary at least six times
and she was wrong every time
beat who was she
i dont know
she was standing outside my building with the police and the reporters
what police and reporters
i have no idea about that either
they found her on the roof
a dead body
thats so sad
but you fell in love
thats so great
one other thing
the sign is now complete and it says coming soon just around the corner
a foxbooks superstore
kathleen and george and christina stand there looking at it
it has nothing to do with us
its big impersonal overstocked and full of ignorant salespeople
but they discount
but they dont provide any service
george and christina nod
kathleen is having lunch with birdie
so really its a good development
you know how in the flower district there are all these flower shops in a row so you can find whatever you want
well this is going to be the book district
if you dont have it we do
and vice versa
kathleen in the kitchen unloading groceries
frank is standing there plugging in an olympia report deluxe electric typewriter
when you are finished with foxbooks the shop around the corner is going to be responsible for reversing the entire course of the industrial revolution
that is so sweet frank
that is so sweet
hey he holds his arms out
over his shoulder she notices the typewriter breaks from the hug what is that doing there
listen to it
just listen he strikes a key
the olympia report deluxe electric report
as in gunshot
that sound is familiar
now listen to this
he puts his ear to the typewriter
kathleen listens too
the gentle and soothing lullaby of a piece of machinery so perfect i know where ive heard it before
she whips a cover off the other typewriter on the table
its the same machine exactly
i needed a backup
dont you have another one at your apartment
i might i might
youre turning my apartment into a typewriter museum
i probably cant
i see one and my knees go weak
anyway what were you starting to say
i dont know
i was just wondering about my work and all
i mean what is it i do exactly
all i really do is run a bookstore all you really do is this incredibly noble thing kathleen nods
but i dont know if i stopping her kathleen but i just you are a lone reed
kathleen looks puzzled
he sticks a piece of paper in the typewriter starts typing
you are a lone reed waving in the breeze standing strong and tall in the corrupt sands of commerce
he whips the piece of paper out of the typewriter and hands it to her
reading from it i am a lone reed
tries it on again i am a lone reed
clutching her piece of paper she wanders into the bathroom
we hear the sound of a typewriter begin to clack away in the next room
kathleen walks past her computer looks at it
then she goes over to the window looks out at her street at dusk
a group of schoolgirls in uniform in two straight lines walk past with a tall woman
she goes over to the bookshelf and pulls out a copy of madeleine by ludwig bemelmans and opens it to the illustration of the twelve little girls in two straight
lines marching through the streets of paris
she looks at it then looks up lost in thought
we hear the sound of the computer keys
sometimes i wonder about my life
i lead a small life
well not small but circumscribed
and sometimes i wonder do i do it because i like it or because i havent been brave
so much of what i see reminds me of something i read in a book when shouldnt it be the other way around
continued and hold on her as she thinks about this
in the other room we hear frank typing
kathleen goes to the computer turns it on
as we see kathleen through her curtains a small figure barely lit by her computer
contd i dont really want an answer
i just want to send this cosmic question out into the void
so goodnight dear void
drip is a cafe on amsterdam avenue with fifties style couches and chairs in cozy seating arrangements
kathleen is standing at the front counter with christina getting drinks
i went to the foxbooks website and you can buy anything
they ship it to you in a day
maybe we should get a website
my mother would never have wanted us to have a website
every book you sell is a gift from your heart
she always said that
as they walk toward the back of the cafe kathleen notices a stack of loose leaf binders on the table
what if they put us out of business
its out of the question
were a fixture in the neighborhood
were practically a landmark
indicating the binders men for women women for men women for women what is this
you fill out one of these forms and they file it in the book and if someone wants to meet you they arrange it
what a stupid way to meet someone
compared to the internet
my little thing on the internet is just a lark
so its still going on
and i do not plan to meet him
indicating the book why do i get the feeling that you are in here somewhere
christina flips the book open to her application
i came in here one night and drank too much coffee and filled one out
off kathleens look well how am i supposed to meet someone
you are a runner
some day you will make eye contact with another runner and no one ever even looks at me
on top of which who are they
they could like the symphony
i could never fall in love with someone who likes to go to the symphony i know
what are you supposed to do there
i dont know
youre supposed to sit
i could never fall in love with anyone who smokes cigars either
ill tell you what i hate
big fat legs like stumps
i hate that too
the worst the worst i could never under any circumstances love anybody who had a sailboat
neither could i
if i had to get up on saturday morning knowing that i was about to go down to the pier and unravel all those ropes and put on all that
sunblock all that talk about the wind
and then you have to go out on the boat and you sail and sail and sail until you are bored witless and then only then do they say lets
turn around and you realize the trip is only half over only its not because the wind has changed it hasnt changed
so then theres more talk about the wind
while you just float up and down trying not to get nauseous
and when you finally get back you have to clean up the boat
why dont people have boat maids
therere all these people who wouldnt be caught dead polishing a doorknob in their house but put them on a boat and they want to rub down everything in sight
joe is on his sailboat
he is polishing his brass and whistling
joe joe jumps off the boat onto the dock to greet his grandfathers daughter annabel who is coming toward the dock with gillian his fathers overdecorated year old fiance her
son matthew and the nanny maureen
picks up annabel annabel how are you today
picks up matt hey big guy dont i get a hello
im going to be your wicked stepmother
joe gives her a peck on the cheek
who is this
i brought her in case you couldnt handle the kids
maureens getting a divorce
im sorry to hear that
its my own fault
never marry a man who lies
that is so wise
remember that annabel
she taught matt to spell his name
f o x
to maureen good work
you can have the day off
ill take over from here
to gillian you must be late for something
volunteer work at the henry street settlement
packing bandages for bosnian refugees
a course in chinese literature at columbia
im having my eggs harvested
theres a block street fair with little booths sausage sandwich concessions etc
annabel and matt have been to the makeup booth
annabel is a cat and matt is a pirate
annabel is carrying a goldfish in a baggie as they walk toward broadway
as joe annabel and matt walk past
theres some sort of toy miniature princess in a pointed hat sitting outside the store and a sign lit with twinkle lights storybook lady today
kathleen is sitting on a stool reading to a group of children including annabel and matt who are crammed into her store
joe is watching along with some parents as kathleen reads from a roald dahl book
matt is sitting on the floor reading a book
kathleen is showing annabel a copy of a book called betsy tacy
this is her best friend tacy whose real name is anastasia and then in the next book betsy and tacy become friends with tib whose real name i am sorry
to tell you is thelma
in another section of the store george is showing joe a first edition of swiss family robinson from the glass case
the illustrations are hand tipped which is why it costs so much
its why its worth so much
joe smiles and turns to see kathleen and annabel at a whole shelf of betsy tacy books
i want all of them
that might be an awful lot for your dad to buy at one time
my dad gets me all the books i want
looking over at joe well thats very nice of him
thats not my dad
thats my nephew oh i dont really think thats your nephew as joe approaches
annabel is my aunt
arent you aunt annabel
annabel nods solemnly
and matt is let me guess
to matt are you his uncle
annabel and matt start giggling
kathleen contd his great grandfather
shouting with glee im his brother
annabel is my grandfathers daughter
and matt is my fathers son
we are an american family
he smiles at kathleen who finds herself smiling back
annabel suddenly sneezes
kathleen takes a handkerchief from her sleeve
its an old fashioned hankie thats embroidered
she offers it to annabel who instead wipes her nose with her hand and then looks at the handkerchief a little puzzled
what is that
oh my do children not even know what handkerchiefs are
a handkerchief is a kleenex you dont throw away
my mother embroidered it for me you see
my initials and a daisy because daisies are my favorite flower
orchids are my favorite flower
to joe you know what else children dont know
they dont know what a telephone booth is
joe is looking at kathleen
who are you
i own this store
are you are
just call me joe
quickly well take these books
he gets the one matt is reading
and the two other kathleen has gotten for annabel
these are wonderful books
as annabel gets older the characters in the books do too
to annabel you can grow up with betsy
youre going to come back again arent you
this is why were never going to go under
our customers are loyal
by way of explanation theyre opening a foxbooks around the corner
my daddy gently putting his hand over her mouth likes to buy at discount
dont tell anyone that annabel its nothing to be proud of spelling thats amazing
you can spell fox
can you spell dog
matt look at this dinosaur book
wouldnt you like a dinosaur book
annabel maybe you could read this to matt while i wrap things up here
moves them to a corner to them quickly sit down read and dont listen to anything i say
returns to counter and gives kathleen some cash
and the dinosaur book too
the world is not driven by discounts believe me
ive been in business forever
i started helping my mother here after school when i was six years old
i used to watch her and it wasnt that she was selling books it was that she was helping people become whoever they were going to turn out to be
when you read a book as a child it becomes part of your identity in a way that no other reading in your life does
stops herself i guess ive gotten carried away
you have and youve made me feel
he cant finish the sentence
he looks at her and sees behind her on the shelf a picture of a woman who is unmistakably kathleens mother with a young kathleen
joe contd enchanting your mother was enchanting
how did you know that
she left the store to me and im going to leave it to my daughter
how old is your daughter now
oh im not married
she smiles at joe
so foxbooks can
go to hell
handing him his books here you go
annabel and matt join him at the counter
kathleen gives them each a lollipop
what about cat
can you spell cat
someplace like the auditorium at the museum of broadcasting
patricia eden joes girlfriend who is the editor in chief of a new york publishing house called eden books is standing at a podium at a sales conference
in the audience are sales reps wholesalers etc
theres a screen behind her with pictures of the authors being flashed on it as she speaks
patricia contd and now the book youve all been waiting for the book its been my dreams to publish
the legendary veronica grant has written her memoirs theres a burst of applause as a photograph of veronica grant flashes on screen
patricia contd and im happy to report it is just crammed with tragedy
she laughs gaily just kidding but seriously its all here poverty addiction divorce tracheotomies we see pictures of veronica at eight with her sharecropper family veronica at with her first
child veronica with a series of husbands veronica in a wheelchair etc
patricia contd her third husband beat her up hip replacement and an amazing face lift where all the injected fat fell to her chin
now we see a blow up of the books jacket with a picture of veronica on it and the title am i rising from ashes or did i just forget
patricia contd this book is fabulous

patricia bursts into tears
patricia contd im sorry

veronica and i have so much in common well not all the sad parts but we were both famous by the time we were and believe me thats rough
wipes her nose with a kleenex pulling herself together anyway i just want to say that im especially thrilled to be publishing it
veronica lives in my building and we met in the elevator
by the time we had traveled from the eighth floor to the first we had a deal
first printing one million copies
everyone applauds enthusiastically
patricia is leaving still surrounded by colleagues and sales reps congratulating her
she is the soul of graciousness
her assistant sarah comes up
quickly you have a dentist appointment in twenty minutes
so you should leave soon
whats my car number
you didnt say anything about a car are you an idiot
of course i need a car
she walks toward the exit
patricia in the pouring rain trying to hail a cab
she spots one across the street
she whistles a longshoremans whistle
the cab makes a u turn but instead of stopping for patricia it stops about twenty feet ahead for a man in an overcoat who gets into it

i am telling you right now and i am memorizing your number dont take him
to the man who the fuck do you think you are
are you going uptown

as the cab turns onto eighth avenue starts uptown
patricia is dialing her cell phone
shes elaborately ignoring the man who stole her cab
veronica its patricia you should have been there it was unbelievable were going to sell truckloads of your book
she hangs up folds up the phone puts it back in her purse as the cab moves on
are you an editor
i am a rabbi
oh my god i said fuck to a rabbi
i hope you dont mind my asking but are you jewish
you should come to our temple
im not really religious
oh i am surprised you seem like a very religious person
youre kidding right
we are at west end avenue and rd street
every friday night we have a joyous time everyone dancing everyone singing
also some wisdom
perhaps you have heard of us we are known as the singles temple
he smiles at her
its a very good place to calm down
the cab stops
oh look i am already here
very nice to meet you
gives the cabbie money take this woman to her destination
he gets out
closes the door
a beat too late goodbye
frank comes up the stoop
kathleen is dressed up for a party
frank walks in looks meaningfully at her
i saw him
i actually saw him
i cant believe it
i saw william spungeon
i thought he was in mexico
maybe hes in mexico but today he was in new york
the most brilliant and reclusive novelist in the history of the world is here in this neighborhood
he may be living on this very block
where did you see him
i was on the subway and this musician got onto the train frank is sitting on the subway reading the village voice
the door between the cars opens and a man playing the clarinet enters the car
no one looks up except frank
and i suddenly saw him sitting directly across from me doing the crossword puzzle
howd you know it was him
he looked exactly the same as his high school yearbook picture which happens to be the last photograph ever taken of him
frank takes out his billfold on the subway pulls out a piece of paper
as frank unfolds a newspaper clipping of a yearbook picture of william spungeon at
frank compares the photo of spungeon with the person sitting across the way
they dont look remotely alike except that the boy in the picture and the man on the subway are both wearing the same style glasses
the subway stops at th street and william spungeon gets off
as frank comes out of the subway station and looks around
so i followed him
frank sees spungeon cross th
frank follows spungeon who hurries into h h bagels passing a homeless man holding a paper cup at the door
he went into h h and bought a bagel with everything
as spungeon leaves the store passing the paper cup which we now realize that frank in dark glasses is holding
spungeon drops his newspaper in a garbage container
he dropped his crossword into the garbage and i rescued it
frank plucks the puzzle from the trashcan follows spungeon
spungeon at the counter in the shoe store
then he went into a sporting good store and bought tube socks pair for
we see frank peeking out at him from behind a stack of running pants
suddenly hes distracted by a couple of joggers
william spungeon and tube socks
i dont want to dwell on it
frank looks back at the counter
and then i lost him
frank waves the crossword puzzle in front of kathleen
do you know what this is worth
he takes an empty instant frame from the closet puts the puzzle into it and sets it next to the typewriters
as the two of them eat dinner
what i was thinking as i was trailing him was that eventually i would have the courage to say hello to him you know not in a horrible intrusive or
slavering fan slash acolyte kind of way but more like hi
how ya doing
have you ever thought about trading up in the sock area
who knows maybe hes read my work and then wed become friends and eventually id introduce him to you you know how much he loves childrens books theres a whole
long section in relativitys smile about the wizard of oz and then maybe hed come out of hiding so he could help save the store
what are you talking about
i mean if things got tough he could help rally support its never going to get to that
the store is fine
as they walk along after dinner
i dont even know why you would say that
neither do i
it just flew out of my mouth
theres enough business for us all
as they go up in an elevator
i mean were fine
youre more than fine youre absolutely fine
the elevator opens onto a publication party for an author named vince mancini
a mix of book people journalists and various other media folk
you know kathleen kelly
how are you
guess who i saw today on the subway
i thought he was in mexico
they start chatting
across the room joe is with patricia who is telling two other people the story of meeting the rabbi in the taxicab
joe looks over and sees kathleen
he suddenly looks stricken
shifts his position so kathleen cant see his face but sneaks a look
would you get me another drink sweetie
im all out
continues chattering so then the rabbi says its a very good place to calm down
isnt that hysterical
they all laugh
joe moves over to the bar
absolut on the rocks
as he is waiting kathleen comes up next to him
a white wine please
very friendly oh hello
remember me from the bookstore
of course i remember you
hows your aunt
gets his drink i have to deliver this
i have a very thirsty date
shes part camel
its joe isnt it
and youre kathleen
joe vanishes into the party
i cant believe you were talking to joe fox
as in she cant even finish the sentence
joe is standing at a table of food his back to the room
your last name is fox
joe spins around looks at her
god i didnt realize
i didnt know who you she trails off were with
quoting i didnt know who you were with
its from the godfather
when the movie producer realizes that tom hagen is the emissary of vito corleone continued kathleen is staring at him
joe contd just before the horses head ends up in his bed never mind you were spying on me werent you
you probably rented those children
why would i spy on you
i am your competition
which you know perfectly well or you would not have put up that sign saying just around the corner
the entrance to our store is around the corner
there is no other way to say it
its not the name of our store its where it is
you dont own around the corner
next thing youll be using twinkle lights
little white christmas lights that twinkle
i use them in my window and on all my displays as if you didnt notice
look the reason i came into your store is that i was spending the day with annabel and matt
i like to buy them a present when i see them because im one of those guys who likes to buy his way into the hearts of children who are
there was only one place to buy childrens books in the neighborhood although that will not always be the case and it was yours and it is a charming little
you probably sell worth of book a year how do you know that
im in the book business
im in the book business oh i see and were the price club
only instead of a ten gallon can of olive oil for
that wont even fit into your kitchen cabinet were selling cheap books
me a spy
and i managed to get my hands on a secret printout of the sales figures of a bookstore so inconsequential and yet full of its own virtue that i was
instantly compelled to rush over and check it out for fear it would drive me out of business kathleen stares at him
joe contd what
off her look what
kathleen shakes her head
frank turns up
im frank navasky joe fox
inventor of the superstore enemy of the mid list novel destroyer of city books tell me something how do you sleep at night
patricia joins them
i use a wonderful over the counter drug ultrasom
dont take the whole thing just half and you will wake up without even that tiniest hangover
youre frank navasky arent you
your last piece in the independent the one about anthony powell was brilliant
im patricia eden eden books
joe this man is the greatest living expert on julius and ethel rosenberg and this is kathleen kelly kathleen glares at him
you liked my piece
god im flattered
you know you write these things and you think someones going to mention them and then the whole week goes by and the phone doesnt ring and you think oh
god im a fraud a failure you know whats always fascinated me about julius and ethel rosenberg is how old they looked when they were really just our age
everyone is stopped dead by this observation and looks at patricia who smiles at them all
to frank im so happy to have finally met you
we will talk
have you ever thought about doing a book
oh sure its passed through my head
something really relevant for today like the luddite movement in th century england
at the same time patricia frank as kathleen and frank get into bed
i really like patricia eden
shes a very nice person
kathleen doesnt respond
frank turns out the light
she needs educating thats all
shes hopelessly driven by money and power but theres a hope for anyone whos that familiar with my work on kathleen as she turns away from frank and lies there
as joe and patricia get into bed
brinkley is already on the bed
i had no idea that frank navasky was so down to earth
joe doesnt respond
patricia turns out the light
you read his stuff you think hes going to be so obscure and abstruse
patricia contd hes always talking about heidigger and foucault and i have no idea what any of its about really
joe gets up
patricia contd where are you going
im not really tired
joe writes on his computer
brinkley on the floor next to him
and cut between joe and his computer screen
do you ever feel you become the worst version of yourself
that a pandoras box of all the secret hateful parts your arrogance your spite your condescension has sprung open
someone provokes you and instead of just smiling and moving on you zing them
hello its mr
im sure you have no idea what im talking about
and cut between screen and as kathleen reads the end of joes letter
kathleen hits the reply key and starts to type i know what you mean and im completely jealous
what happens to me when im provoked is that i get tongue tied
my mind goes blank
then i spend all night tossing and turning trying to think of what i should have said
as he replies wouldnt it be wonderful if i could pass all my zingers to you and then i would never behave badly and you could behave badly all the
time and wed both be happy
on the other hand i must warn you that when you finally have the pleasure of saying the thing you mean to say at the moment you mean to say
it remorse inevitably follows
do you think we should meet
kathleen stares at joes letter in her computer
she sits staring at the letter
she has no idea what to do
as the iron gates on all the stores start to open just the way we saw them open in the opening sequence of the movie
the cosmetics supply store
the video store
and now finally we see the new grate on the new foxbooks superstore start to open upwards
this is the finest grate on broadway no question of it
its electric and almost soundless
we see a sign saying opening day
off on people on the street notice the store
one walks in
camera follows him
the inside is beautiful
gleaning staircase a cafe comfortable chairs to sit a bank of cashiers everyone decked out in gray alligator shirts with a fox where the alligator should be a rope for
the checkout line and seven cash registers with seven cashiers
of course books books books as far as the eye can see
the store is jam packed
joe with his father nelson his grandfather schuyler and kevin the store manager
no pickets no demonstrations
the neighborhood loves us
theyre wondering where weve been all these years
theyre wondering how they ever did without it
its a hit
they admire their own store walk through the downstairs and start up the staircase to the second floor
hows the childrens book department
its early yet
school isnt out
and theres that childrens bookstore nearby cecilias store her daughters well crush it she was enchanting
and as they walk on upstairs several mothers with children come up the stairs behind them
a little group of children dressed as pilgrims walk down the street as kathleen comes around the corner to buy her morning paper
joe is at the newsstand
she turns and pretends to be staring at a wall until he finishes buying his paper and walks on
i dont think its a good idea for us to meet
joe is putting sugar into his coffee at the sugar counter as kathleen comes in
he pretends he didnt see her
contd i love our relationship
theres a lot going on in the day to dayness of my life and theres something magical
we see kathleen and george at the end of the day counting the receipts
birdie is using a calculator to total them
christina is shelving books
there are thanksgiving decorations cardboard turkeys and pilgrims books on colonists like myles standish
contd and thrilling about this island in cyberspace i have with you
so please about less than the same week last year
that could be a fluke right
they look at each other
their store is new
its a novelty
but it will all shake out
do you think i should put up more twinkle lights
thats a lovely idea
what if we have to fold
ill never find another part time job and i wont be able to pay the rent and ill have to move to brooklyn
the joy of rent control
six room for a month
youve told us a million times
i cant believe youre bringing it up at a time like this
its like bragging because youre tall
birdie never brags about her rent and she pays even less than you
i just rattle around from one to the other
we are not going to fold
the door opens and meredith carter the woman george had swooned over in front of his building walks in
george stares frozen in place as she walks up to him
i have died and gone to heaven yes
flashing her badge detective carter rd precinct
id like to ask you a few questions
kathleen suddenly sees george following meredith out of the store
hes in a complete daze
where are you going
he goes out the door
laura margulies a well known childrens book author enters as george leaves
kathleen are you surviving
were so excited about your new book
when should we schedule your signing
oh its being published in january
are you going to be in business in january
im so worried
were doing great arent we
no difference whatsoever
well you know you can count on me
for anything support rallies
we can get the times to write something
or that nut in the independent what nut in the independent
this is just the sort of thing that would outrage him
she smiles brightly
george and meredith are sitting in a booth
pappas im investigating the murder of the woman found on the roof of your building
do you live alone there
do i live alone
yes i do
do you live alone
george takes her hand in his and looks at it as if it were the eighth wonder of the world
he starts stroking it caressing it
meredith pulls it away
then she gives it right back to him
he continues stroking
they stare at each other
he puts her fingers into his mouth
overwhelmed what are you doing
i dont know
i have no idea
you have to stop
she utters a little moan
they come into the apartment
she throws herself into his arms
as christina runs desperately trying to make eye contact with men running in the opposite direction
no one will look at her
the place is mobbed the usual crush the night before thanksgiving
kathleen pushing a shopping cart is trying to wedge her way through the crowd in the cheese department
as she reaches across three people to grab some brie she sees joe walk into the store
quickly she turns her back so he cant see her
she stands there frozen
peeks around doesnt see him anywhere
cranes her neck this way and that
kathleen now wearing dark glasses but looking not at all disguised looks around and spots a short line and makes a beeline for it
at that moment joe comes from the appetizing department and gets on the line she was heading for
panicked kathleen retreats onto another line and stands with her back to him
the cashier totals up kathleens purchases and kathleen hands over her credit card
this is a cash only line
omigod i only have a credit card
is that okay
of course its not okay theres a sign
theres a sign
to the person behind her she doesnt have cash
she doesnt have cash is repeated all the way down the line
joe turns to see whats going on
get on another line lady
do you need some money
no i dont need any money
thank you very much
get on another line
off her nametag big smile rose
rose this is kathleen im joe and this is a credit card machine
rose just stares at him
joe contd now its your turn to say happy thanksgiving back
happy thanksgiving back
joe looks at her winks
mississippi is a hard word to spell
how do you spell it
big smile now take this credit card and put it through the machine zip zip
the cashier completely charmed takes kathleens credit card
kathleen is appalled
everyone on the line signs irritably and audibly
so youre fine
as kathleen signs the charge slip and the cashier exasperatedly starts to put her groceries into a bag
an elegant east side apartment
schuyler his youngish french wife yvette nelson gillian and their child matt and joe are sitting and listening as annabel sings tomorrow
the sunll come up tomorrow bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow therell be sun joe is on a loveseat with matt
gillian lifts matt up sits down in his place next to joe and plunks matt into her lap
nelson is already seated in a chair in front of the loveseat and cant see her without turning around
as she continues singing gillian moves her hand next to joes leg
joe edges away
he looks around the room sees nanny maureen standing behind the couch
he stands offers her his seat
a much more informal thanksgiving dinner
we see the leftovers on a sideboard near a round table in kathleens living room
kathleen frank birdie christina george and georges new girlfriend meredith and two other friends are standing around the upright piano
birdie is playing a christmas song and everyone is singing
as the singing continues over we cut to as the christmas decorations and twinkle lights go into the window
birdie walks by the store
she stops to look at the customers inside and then notices a sign in the window book signing january best selling childrens author laura margulies
theres a picture of laura margulies
kathleen is in the window decorating a little tree with lovely decorations from a box
two people are carrying a tree home theres the sound of church bells
kathleen looks up as a couple of people walk past the store carrying foxbooks shopping bags
then she unwraps a pair of ruby slipper ornaments and as she starts to hang them on the tree we hear the sound of the computer
this is such an odd christmas
i find myself missing my mother whos been dead for ten years
new york at christmas is so loaded with all the things we used to do as young kathleen dressed in a little velvet dress sits in the audience next to
her mother watching the ballet
contd going to the nutcracker kathleen v
contd ice skating at rockefeller center where i was knocked into a year old maniac a six year old boy knocks into her
hey watch out me watch out why dont you watch out
im not sliding around like a baby
you think i come here to skate with babies
young kathleens jaw drops and she stands there tongue tied
my first experience as a speechless person
her mother skates up and takes her hand
the boy skates off
i always miss my mother at christmas but somehow its worse this year since i need some advice from her
and we hear the sound of another computer
as he replies to kathleen
my mother took me ice skating too we see a little boy young joe skate past holding someones hand joe v
contd although my mother did not skate
the nanny skated and we now see joes nanny a young sonja henie who suddenly peels off into a series of triple lutzes as joes mother absently reads a copy
of vogue in the spectators section
and i was in the nutcracker
we see the stage now
theres young joe among the children at the christmas party
contd so was my nanny
as joes nanny pirouettes past
contd different nanny
by the way im surprised you arent a writer
although you probably are a writer and dont know it
are you a writer and dont know it
young joe at the dinner table with his father
a wide shot of a big room with a huge table and servants
joe looks very small at the table as he eats his soup
contd my mother died when i was ten
i was staying with my father who is not famous for intimacy and whose way of breaking the news of her death was to tell me she would not be
coming to pick me up as usual
it was a car accident and i dont know where she was going or who she was with and i assume what i owe her is my tendency to cover
almost any emotion with a joke
a useful gift unless you want to know what youre feeling
she was very beautiful
people toss that word around a lot but my mother was
the camera moves closer to the dining table
we see that tears are rolling down little joes cheeks
joe stops typing
he is surprised to find his eyes watering
a moment of confusion as he cannot believe he has moved himself to tears
shakes his head shakes the emotion off
starts typing again
contd ancient history
so what kind of advice do you need
can i help
kathleen in bed with her laptop reading joes letter
she starts to type a response
suddenly theres harp arpeggio and an instant message flashes on screen
from ny i had a gut feeling you would be on line now
joe is in bed with his laptop
and cut back and forth between them and their computer screens as they type instant messages to one another
possible split screens
contd i can give you advice
im great at advice
i dont think you can help
is it about love
my business is in trouble
my mother would have something wise to say
im a brilliant businessman
its what i do best
whats your business
no specifics remember
minus specifics its hard to help
except to say go to the mattresses
its from the godfather
it means you have to go to war
to herself the godfather
she starts to type
what is it with men and the godfather
the godfather is the i ching
the godfather is the sum of all wisdom
the godfather is the answer to any question
what should i pack for my summer vacation
leave the gun take the cannoli
what day of the week is it
maunday tuesday thursday wednesday
and the answer to your question is go to the mattresses
continued joe contd youre at war
its not personal its business
its not personal its business
recite that to yourself every time you feel youre losing your nerve
i know you worry about being brave this is your chance
fight to the death
patricia comes in as joe is waiting for kathleens response
look what i bought
joe types ciao and signs off
looks up to see patricia showing him a plexiglas menorah
i was just passing this store on columbus avenue and it caught my eye
what is it
it doesnt look like a menorah
i dont know what came over me
i dont even celebrate hanukkah
as kathleen logs off frank comes in
frank ive decided to go to the mattresses
do you think it would be a gigantic conflict of interest if you wrote something about us
the store is more crowded than weve seen it
frank is there with several copies of the independent
the phone is ringing off the hook
christina and george are fielding calls
birdie is reading franks article
reading kathleen kelly and her mother cecilia kelly have raised your children
if this precious resource is killed by the cold cash cow of foxbooks it will not only be the end of western civilization as we know it but the end
of something even dearer our neighborhood as we know it
save the shop around the corner and you will save your own soul
frank thats charming
you think its a little over the top
just say thank you
calling to kathleen channel s outside
kathleen is primping in a tiny wall mirror
she takes a deep breath
in a second
from the other room the village voice is coming
frank sticks his head in
in shock its him
it is god
kathleen comes out of the storage room
william spungeon is standing there
im william spungeon
im very pleased to meet you
im kathleen kelly
frank is practically levitating
i knew your mother
although she knew me only as w
that enormous bookstore is obscene
im frank navasky
i carry your picture in my wallet
he pulls it out
spungeon looks at him like hes crazy
weve organized pickets
channel is doing a special
id be glad to talk to the press if its all right with you
theyve been trying to interview me for years
im the press
youd allow that
for the store
although you wouldnt have to be photographed
i respect that
if its television they could just put one of those blurry dots in front of your face
referring to the tv crew theyre waiting for you i know all your books
phaelox the gnome the little man who comes from nowhere
and is going nowhere
quoting where did you come from
where are you going
im starting to break out in hives
to kathleen heres my phone number
i had no idea william spugeon had a phone
he gives a little wave and leaves
this is historic
beat do you realize what ive done
by writing that piece do you realize
ive brought william spungeon in from the cold
i am completely amazing
at that moment a tv reporter sticks her head into the store
kathleen takes a deep breath walks out the door
are you ready miss kelly
luca brasi sleeps with the fishes
were here in front of the shop around the corner the famous west side childrens bookstore now on the verge of having to close its doors because the big bad
wolf foxbooks has opened only a few hundred feet away wooing customers with its sharp discounts and designer coffee
they have to have discounts and lattes because most of the people who work there have never read a book
and pull back now to reveal that were in five tv sets are on over adjoining treadmills joe and kevin are on two of the treadmills walking and watching
shes not as nice as she seems on television
youve met her
shes kind of a pill
shes probably not as attractive as she seems on television either
no shes beautiful
but a pill
so you dont feel bad about basically destroying her livelihood not to mention her legacy not to mention her raison detre
its not personal its business
they look up at the television
joe onscreen with a super joe fox vice president foxbooks
i sell cheap books
i sell cheap books and as a result listen to this because its really bad more people can buy books
the show immediately cuts back to the newscaster
on joe and kevin
thats what you said
outraged thats not all i said
i said i cant believe those bastards i said we were great i said people can come and sit and read for hours and no one bothers them i said
we stock titles i showed them the new york city section
i said we were a goddamn piazza where people could mingle and mix and be
i was eloquent
its just inevitable isnt it
people are going to want to turn her into joan of arc and you into attila the hun
well its not me personally its more like its the company on the television and i have to say i have met joe fox who owns foxbooks and i have
heard him compared his store to a price club and the books in it to cans of olive oil
on joe reacting
a small rally is taking place with picket signs
kathleen is standing on a small speakers platform along with the borough president
my mother used to say to me that every book you sell is a gift from the heart
as children march in front of the store holding little makeshift picket signs and singing songs
one two three four we dont want this superstore
customers go right through the line and into the store
we can hear the pickets marching and singing outside although the store is full of customers anyway
the fox men joe nelson and schuyler are sitting in the cafe
nelson is holding a copy of a weekly newspaper which has the old high school yearbook picture of william spungeon on the front page and a headline william spungeon emerges
from hiding to support bookstore
who is this spungeon anyway
hes a writer
well ive never heard of him
and neither has anyone else in this place
as we see sidney ann strongin a young and attractive pbs talk show hostess for a show called inside media
the new york literary world was shocked this week when william spungeon the most famously reclusive author since j
salinger announced that he was coming out of hiding because of his loyalty to a small childrens bookstore on the west side of manhattan
discussing this tonight is a man i happen to think of as one of this citys most underappreciated assets frank navasky
this all happened because of you didnt it well i knew william spungeon loved childrens books so i wrote a provocative column your specialty
sidney ann laughs
and it kind of smoked him out
as she and frank watch the television show
technologically speaking the worlds out of hand
take the vcr
the whole idea of a vcr is that it makes it possible for you to tape whats on television while youre out of the house
but the whole point of being out of the house is so you can miss whats on television
now theres a medium i can get behind
well were on television
and youre good at it
another little moment between them
tell us about it
are you planning to collect radios
do you think i should
the shop around the corner is a true new york treasure
as are you
id love to have you back
are we done
not at all
because i just want to say that the only show i do watch is yours
hey i was just being polite
okay i admit i slobbered all over her
the show continues
as we see kathleen flip the open sign to closed
george is talking to kathleen and birdie who is toting up the weeks receipts
and i cant decide whether to put sausages into the meat sauce or just chopped meat
last time i made it detective carter and i never even sat down to dinner because he makes some sort of hand gesture indicating that sex prevented them from dining
and last night i made margaritas in the blender and i took the ice cube and spare us
george goes out the door
birdie looks at kathleen
dont tell me
not the slightest difference
birdie cant bring herself to answer
kathleen contd how could that be
all this publicity and not one bit of difference
oh birdie what am i going to do
what would mom have done
lets ask her
she opens the locket hanging around her neck
theres a picture of kathleens mother inside it
birdie holds the locket up to her face
cecilia what should we do
birdie holds the locket to her ear and listens
after a beat shrugs she has no idea but she thinks the window display is lovely
good night dearie
birdie smiles and picks up her shopping bag goes out the door
its starting to rain
kathleen lowers the grate over the store
as she turns to walk away william spungeon steps in her path out of the shadows
oh my goodness hello
what are you doing here
so does she
dramatically he whips out an umbrella and opens it over the two of them
spungeon contd you look very beautiful
but im a wreck
he touches her cheek suddenly
then he blows on his hand
they start walking
are you writing another book
im in the home stretch
ill be done in approximately six more years
should i discount
its about a man on a quest for knowledge who meets a woman he cannot resist
if i discount i have to fire someone because i cant discount with this overhead but whom could i fire
i couldnt fire anyone
spungeon suddenly puts his hand through kathleens hair
she stops frozen in place
you have your mothers hair
thick wild the color of nebraska wheat
he grabs her and tries to kiss her
what are you doing
let me go
he backs her into a wall
are you crazy
she kicks him in the shins wiggles free and runs away
calling after her if you change your mind you can e mail me
the mail form says to and kathleen types in ny
the form says re and kathleen types in advice rain is falling
i need help
do you still want to meet me
rain is falling
we hear the sound of the computer
george kathleen and christina in the shop
kathleen is buying more lollipops
were meeting in a public place
well dont go anywhere with him
dont even go out to the street with him afterwards
get a dial cab to just sit there and wait for you
did you tell frank
theres nothing to tell
but did you tell him
at the nd anniversary of the chicago seven trial
and hes gone to a place where there are no phones
do you even know this guys name
kathleen shakes her head no
and youre going to meet him in a bar
not a bar
that place on rd with the cheesecake
and he will wear a flower in his lapel and you will be carrying a copy of anna karenina with a rose in it
oh god no
not anna karenina
pride and prejudice
as joe and kevin walk out of the store and start downtown
i suppose shes carrying a copy of a book with a flower in it
joe doesnt say anything
which jane austen is it
pride and prejudice
she could be a real dog
look ill just stay ten minutes
ill say hello
drink a cup of coffee and split
im outta here
he looks at kevin
joe contd walk me there okay
as the two men walk toward cafe lalo the european cafe on west rd street
what if she has a really high squeaky voice
i hate that
it reminds me of those mice in cinderella
what mice in cinderella
gus gus and oh shit i cant remember the other one
why am i compelled to meet her
im just ruining a good thing
youre taking it to the next level
i always do that
i always take a relationship to the next level and if it works okay i take it to the next level after that until i can finally get to the
level where it becomes absolutely necessary for me to leave
im not going to stay long anyway
i already said that didnt i
im a total wreck
as they reach joe stops and looks at kevin
kevin this woman is the most adorable creature i have ever come in contact with
if she turns out to be even as good looking as a mailbox i will be crazy not to turn my life upside down and marry her
she could be a real dog
a total panic you go look
just go to the window and check her out
kevin goes to the window and looks inside
joe and kevin in front
kevin looks in the window
theres a beautiful whoa a very beautiful girl
but no book
let me see let me see
wait a minute
theres a book with a flower so it must be her
what does he look like
theres a waiter blocking i cant see her face
hes serving her a cup of tea and shes putting in three spoonfuls of sugar well why shouldnt she
unless she has hypoglycemia
oh hes moving
can you see her
clearly frustrated shes very pretty
i knew she would be
she had to be
i would say she has a little of the coloring of that kathleen kelly person
kathleen kelly of the bookstore
you said you thought she was attractive
who cares about kathleen kelly
well if you dont like kathleen kelly i can tell you right now you aint gonna like this girl
because it is kathleen kelly
joe elbows kevin aside and looks
a long beat
what are you going to do
youre going to let her just wait there
yes i am
thats exactly what im going to do
but she wrote the letters
good night kevin
ill see you tomorrow
he walks away leaving kevin
kevin stares after him
then he walks away in the other direction
kathleen sitting alone at a table for two is drinking her tea
shes starting to feel a little foolish
she checks her watch
a loud boisterous group comes in and sits at the table next to hers
a man from the group grabs the empty chair at kathleens table
do you mind
kathleen jumps up
im expecting someone
she takes the chair back
sits down again
she watches the group as they playfully fight over the menus
she checks her watch again
then she opens her copy of pride and prejudice and looks at it
she cant focus
a man comes into the restaurant and she looks up hopefully at him
but hes going to meet another group of people
as he passes her table he knocks the book and the flower onto the floor
she jumps up and rescues the book and flower as if they were precious china
in the window now behind her joe appears
he watches as she rearranges the book and the flower
he disappears from sight
he walks in the door
what a coincidence
mind if i sit down
yes i do
im expecting someone
joe picks up her book looks at it
pride and prejudice
kathleen grabs it back
do you mind
she places it back on the table puts the rose into it
i didnt know you were a jane austen fan
not that its a surprise
i bet you read it every year
i bet you just love mr
darcy and that your sentimental heart beats wildly at the thought that he and whatever her name is are really honestly and truly going to end up together
would you please leave
joe sits down
ill get up as soon as your friend comes
is he late
the heroine of pride and prejudice is elizabeth bennet and shes one of the greatest most complex characters ever written not that you would know
as a matter of fact ive read it
well good for you
i think youd discover a lot of things if you really knew me
if i really knew you i know what i would find instead of a brain a cash register instead of a heart a bottom line
kathleen is shocked at herself
what is it
i just had a breakthrough and i have to thank you for it
for the first time in my life when confronted with a horrible insensitive person i actually knew what i wanted to say and i said it
i think you have a gift for it
it was a splendid mixture of poetry and meanness
let me tell you dont misunderstand me im just paying you a compliment
he lifts the book off the table
kathleen grabs for it
why are you doing this
she manages to get the book leaving joe with the rose
what have we have
a red no crimson rose tucked into the pages
something you read about in a book no doubt
one of those books with a lady in a nightgown on the cover about to throw herself off a cliff
she holds her hand out for it
kathleen contd give it to me
joe puts it between his mouth and his nose like a mustache
its a joke to you isnt it
everythings a joke to you
she grabs the rose
puts it back in the book
kathleen contd please leave
i beg you
he stands up walks from the table sits down at the very next table with his back to her
the door to the restaurant opens
kathleen looks at it hopefully
a pleasant looking man whos immediately joined by a pleasant looking woman
for a moment kathleen looks just a little droopy as if the wind has just gone out of her sails
she takes out her compact looks into her mirror
she slides it over to look behind her at him just as hes looking sideways at her
he turns away suddenly
then she blots her lipstick with her handkerchief
you know what the handkerchief reminds me of
the first day i met you the first day you lied to me i didnt lie to you you did too i did not i thought all that fox stuff
was so charming
f o x
i never lied about it joe
just call me joe
as if you were one of those stupid year old girls with no last name
hi im kimberley
hi im janice
whats wrong with them
dont they know youre supposed to have last names
its like theyre a whole generation of cocktail waitresses
she stops herself its a tangent she never meant to go off on
but joe has stood up and seated himself back at her table
i am not a stupid year old girl thats not what i meant and when i said the thing about the price club and cans of olive oil that wasnt
what i meant either oh you poor sad multimillionaire
i feel so sorry for you
the door opens and a large and very attractive transvestite in a boa comes in the door
i am going to take a wild guess that this isnt him either
who is he i wonder
not i gather the worlds greatest living expert on julius and ethel rosenberg but someone else entirely
will you be you be mean to him too
will you start out sweet as sugar candy and then suddenly miraculously like a bolt from the blue find that sharp little tongue of yours
no i wont
because the man whos coming here tonight is completely unlike you
the man who is coming here is kind and funny he has the most wonderful sense of humor but hes not here
if hes not here he has a reason because there is not a cruel or careless bone in his body
i cant expect you to know anything about a person like that
youve nothing but a suit
joe gets up
that is my cue
kathleen comes down the street
she drops the rose in the trash can
kathleen comes in drops the book on the table takes off her coat and goes immediately to the computer
she clicks on american online
waits impatiently to connect
looks with anticipation at the mail box
hold on kathleen as a tear starts down her face
she takes her handkerchief out of her sleeve and wipes her face and blows her nose
then looks at her handkerchief and tosses it over her shoulder
she goes over to the bed and turns it down and slips out of her shoes
then she lies down on the bed fully clothed
she reaches up to turn out the light
as joe turns on his closet light and hangs up his jacket
the computer is on the desk and the light on it illuminates the room
patricia is in the next room eating matzos
so i said to her if you think i will even talk to you about paying that kind of advance for an author whose last book is being used as
trivets all over the world you are completely crazy
on joes face barely bearing
as kevin and joe walk through the store
but underneath that disagreeable exterior she could turn out to be a real bitch
lets not talk about it
im going back to the office
you must have work to do
this place is humming like a top
as kathleen comes around the corner
christina is waiting
he never came
he stood you up
as kathleen puts her purse into the drawer
i think something happened something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for him george walks in
he wasnt able to make it
he stood you up
what could have happened
continued george looks suddenly stricken
kathleen contd why didnt he come
maybe he showed up took one look at me and left
maybe there was a subway accident
a train was trapped underground with him inside
and no phone
george continues to look stricken
hes starting to shake his head
or an automobile accident
those cab drivers are maniacs
they hit something and you slam right into that plastic partition
his elbows could be in splints so he cant really dial or he could be in the hospital in one of those semi private room with like together no phone
they look at george
still shaking his head
to george what
george hands them a new york post
they look at the cover what are you saying
it could be
george contd he was arrested two blocks from the cheesecake place
is there a picture
there it is
its of a man with his jacket pulled over his head
they all look at it
so that explains it
he was in jail
and there was a phone but he got only one call and he had to use it to call his lawyer
you are so lucky
you could be dead
are you crazy
this man couldnt possibly be the rooftop killer
remember when you thought frank might be the unabomber
that was different
how long did you sit there all alone
not that long
joe fox came in joe fox
i dont want to talk about it
closes her eyes lets get to work
they look around
theres no one in the store and nothing to do
there must be something to do
theres always something to do
they hear the jingle of the front door
they look hopefully toward it
its only birdie
he stood her up
hold on kathleen as the computer sound begins
i have been thinking about you
last night i went to meet you and you werent there
i wish i knew why
i felt so foolish
continued as she types
and we cut from her face to the screen as we hear a voice over and as i waited someone else showed up a man who has made my professional
life a misery and an amazing thing happened i was able for the first time in my life to say the exact thing i wanted to say it
and of course afterwards i felt terrible
just as you said i would
the e mail from kathleen continues as joe reads
i was cruel and im never cruel
and even though i can hardly believe what i said mattered to this man to him im just a bug to be crushed but what if it did
no matter what hes done to me theres no excuse for my behavior
anyway you are my dear friend and i so wanted to talk to you
i hope you have a good reason for not being there last night but if you dont and if we never really connect again i just want to tell you
how much it has meant to me to know you were there
joe sits there a second
a moment of intense ambivalence
then he hits the menu key and signs off
joe stands and leaves the room
the computer sits there
hold on the computer
we hear him open the refrigerator door
we hear him close the refrigerator door
he passes the den without even looking into it
a moment later he comes back into the room stares at the computer
he starts for the bedroom changes his mind
circles the computer
hes going to go cold turkey if it kills him
he sits down
starts to type
i am in vancouver
hits the delete button and erases the message
he starts typing again i was stuck in a meeting which i couldnt get out of it and there was no phone
he backspaces to erase there was no phone
screen now reads i was stuck in a meeting which i couldnt get out of it
joe sits there thinking for a moment
then he starts typing
contd the electricity went out in the building and we were trapped on the th floor and the telephone system blew too
he stops and looks at it
then he types joe v
contd amazingly enough
he sits looking at it
then he deletes the whole thing
sits looking at the blank screen
he clicks the yes box
then he starts to type again
dear friend i cannot tell you what happened to me last night but i beg you from the bottom of my heart to forgive me for not being there
he deletes for not being there
then types again after to forgive me
for what happened
i feel terrible that you found yourself in a situation that caused you additional pain
but im absolutely sure that whatever you said last night was provoked even deserved
and everyone says things they regret when theyre worried or stressed
you were expecting to see someone you trusted and met the enemy instead
the fault is mine
continued as kathleen and christina walk down the street together
contd someday ill explain everything
meanwhile im still here
talk to me
did he say anything about meeting again
it doesnt matter
well just be like george bernard shaw and mrs
patrick campbell and write letters our whole lives they go into an apartment building
a large rent controlled west side apartment
birdie is pouring tea
theres a plate of cookies
christina is looking at the picture of birdie as a young woman dressed in a sort of carmen miranda getup
where was this taken birdie
when you had the thunderbolt
what did you decide dearie
were going to close
although it feels like such a failure
it feels like im quitting
it feels like
she closes her eyes
birdie sits down on the loveseat next to kathleen puts her arms around her
hold on them
keeping the store open doesnt keep your mother alive although sometimes i think we all think it does
christina looks over at the picture of birdie
who was it birdie
that you had the thunderbolt over
birdie shakes her head
shes not going to tell them
christina contd its so romantic
but it wasnt meant to be
he ran spain
he ran it
that was his job
and then he died
just as well
as frank and kathleen go up the escalator on their way to a movie
she fell in love with generalissimo franco
dont say that
we dont know that for sure
who else could it have been
it was probably around i mean its not like he was something normal like a socialist or an anarchist or something it happened in spain
people do really stupid things in foreign countries
they buy leather jackets they go see flamenco they ride in gondolas they eat in restaurants where guitarists sing malaguena sola rosa but they dont fall in love with fascist
they enters one of the theatres
as they find seats and sit down
a trailer is playing
birdie is a very kind person shes practically my surrogate mother
well shes out of her mind
she is not
i could never ever be with anyone who doesnt take politics as seriously as i do
the person in front of them turns around
do you mind
a hot dog is singing
you need quiet while a hot dog is singing
the two of them sit there
i have something to tell you
i didnt vote
in the last mayoral election when rudy giuliani was running against ruth messinger i went to get a manicure and forgot to vote
since when do you get manicures
oh i suppose you could never be with a woman who gets manicures
i forgive you
you forgive me
hold on them a beat
kathleen stands and walks out of the theatre
kathleen on the down escalator
frank scrambling to catch up with her
whats going on
frank contd hey
what is it
as they walk uptown
look this has been a big week youre closing the store its not that frank really its not
i know that was terrible of me
to jump all over you when im the one whos really
oh god i dont know how to say this what is it
as we see kathleen and frank being served drinks in a glassed in extension of a restaurant
as kathleen looks at frank waiting for him to begin
youre a wonderful person kathleen
so are you
and im honored that you want to be with me because you would never be with anyone who wasnt truly worthy i feel exactly the same way about you
oh god dont say that please that just makes it worse
he shakes his head you dont love me
frank shakes his head no
you dont love me
kathleen shakes her head no
but were so right for each other
a long beat
that woman on television right
i mean nothings happened or anything
i think shes a republican
i cant help myself
kathleen pats him
frank contd what about you
is there someone else
oh somewhere out there im sure
somewhere she throws up her hands in cyberspace
as frank carrying a typewriter walks out off kathleens building and puts it into the back of a taxicab
as a sign goes up in the window closing this week all stock off
the store is crowded
people are buying stacks of books
we hear brief snatches of conversation birdie telling a customer shes planning to travel christina saying shes finally going to have to finish her dissertation george saying hes been offered
a job at foxbooks but even though its okay with kathleen he wouldnt work there if it were the last place on the earth
there is a frantic rummage sale atmosphere
kathleen busy at the cash register looks up for a minute at her beautiful store being ravaged by vultures
we hear the sound of the computer and hear her voice over my store is closing this week
i own a store
did i ever tell you that
its a lovely store as a woman dumps a huge stack of books on the checkout table
this is a tragedy
yelling across the shop to her husband honey grab a copy of the trumpet of the swan
contd and in a week it will be something really depressing like a baby gap
i am being amazingly brave what are you going to do with yourself
i dont know
im going to take some time
i have a little money saved
im almost looking forward to it kathleen v
contd i am so cheerful i would make pollyanna throw up
i came here every saturday when i was a little girl
i remember when your mother gave me anne of green gables
read it with a box of kleenex thats what she told me
shes looking down on you right now
im sure she is
contd i have promised myself im not going to cry
a forth shopper approaches the counter with a stack of books up to his chin and manages to slide the stack on the counter
we should bomb foxbooks
its not their fault
the truth is the world is just
she starts ringing up the sale
as kathleen walks home
contd soon well just be a memory
in fact someone some foolish person will probably think its a tribute to this city the way it keeps changing on you the way you can never count on it
i know because thats the sort of thing im always saying
but the truth is im heartbroken
i feel as if part of me has died and my mother has died all over again and no one can ever make it right
she stops in front of the window watching the customers lined up to buy books
as kathleen enters and looks around
she goes up the stairs
as kathleen walks into it
its huge of course
with its reading area and stage and room for displays and child size furniture and so many books and so many customers
kathleen sits down on a little child size chair completely wilted
and now we see joe watching her from a distance
she doesnt see him
a woman browsing stops a sales person
do you have the shoe books
the shoe books
whos the author
i dont know
my friend told me my daughter has to read the shoe books so here i am
noel streatfeild wrote ballet shoes and skating shoes and theater shoes and movie shoes
she starts crying as she tells her id start with skating shoes its my favorite although ballet shoes is completely wonderful
how do you spell that
as she walks away
to herself they know nothing they know absolutely nothing
as he watches her
we hear the sound of the computer
she starts out of the store
and hold on him
a screen which says reply and which now reads im sorry
on joe at his computer staring at the screen
he backspaces deleting
starts typing again
i dont know what to say
truly i dont
and anything i do say will sound trite
i hope you feel better
he sits there appalled at his own triteness
as a taxi comes down the street and stops in front of joes building
what i was thinking was shed probably make a great childrens book either
why would you think that
they get out of the cab
she knows everything
she has flawless taste
shes famous for it
the salesmen swear by her
if she likes it it sells
as they enter the lobby and walk toward the elevator
so youre going to offer her a job
what else has she got to do
now that shes destitute thanks to you
well i cant imagine her working for you
she has a horrible personality shes
nice to everyone all the time
and her staff turnover is non existent
theyve been there forever
recently when they all found out they were going to lose their jobs
thanks to you
the elevator door is closing
patricia contd hold the elevator
they get in
hello charlie veronica
last time we rode in an elevator we made the deal of the century
what is going to happen this time
miss grants going to get me a part in one of her movies thats whats going to happen
in your dream charlie
back to the conversation with joe i love how youve totally forgotten you had any role in her current situation
its so obtuse
it reminds me of someone who
who does it remind me of
thinks for a moment me
the elevator suddenly stops
it is stuck
he pushes the open button
turns the key hits the open button flicks the emergency switch
the he starts hitting the buttons in every possible combination
charlie what are you doing
bang the door
joe bangs the door
i hope this thing doesnt plummet to the basement
can it do that
he picks up the phone
this is joe fox
who is this
were stuck on the sixth floor
there are four of us grabs the phone and if you dont get your ass up here in two shakes and get us out he hangs up
to veronica are you all right
joe hands her his handkerchief
everyone should jump in the air
the elevator thinks that no one is here and it opens
everyone stares at each other
one two three they all jump into the air
they all land
patricia is sitting on the elevator floor polishing her nails
we hear the fire department banging outside
if i ever get out of here im going to start speaking to my mother
she slept with oscar and maybe it was oscars fault i dont know and then she sold the story to inside edition
that could have been oscars idea too
but i divorced him
i wonder what shes doing right this minute
i think of her
whenever i hear about a new pill
ecstasy zoloft fenphen i just think i hope mama knows about that
she takes out a tissue and dabs at her eyes
maybe you can make up on rosie
that would be so great for the book
trying to figure it out if i ever get out of here
if i ever get out of here im having my eyes lasered
im marrying oreet
i love her
i should marry her
i dont know whats been stopping me
he takes out his wallet and looks at a picture of oreet shows it to joe
if i ever get out of here im going to he stops he looks at patricia who is fishing through her purse
where is my tictacs
looks at joe what
the firemen crowbar open the elevator door
joe and brinkley walk out on the dock toward joes boat
joe is carrying brinkleys pillow his laptop and a suitcase
he boards his boat and goes below
a light goes on
we hear the sound of the computer
i came home tonight and got into the elevator to go to my apartment
an hour later i got out of the elevator and brinkley and i moved out
suddenly everything had become clear
continued a small sleeping area with a berth and a little table where joes laptop has been hooked up to the phone
joe is on the narrow berth as is brinkley
contd its a long story
full of the personal details we avoid so carefully
joe puts brinkley on the floor on his pillow
brinkley jumps back onto the berth with joe
kathleen is making tea
she starts toward the bedroom
we see her computer now hooked up in the living room where all of franks typewriters used to be
i wonder whether change isnt a kind of infection
you start with one thing something you never ever thought would change and it does continued kathleen v
contd and the next thing you know even your bed is in a different place
continued kathleen enters the bedroom and we see the entire room has been rearranged
she gets into bed and turns on the television set
the bookshelves are empty
contd six months ago when you and i first met i knew everything about myself what i would be doing for the rest of my life and even the person
i would be doing it with
now i know nothing
on the door is a small sign
after years we are closing our doors
we have loved being part of your lives
kathleen turns out the light in the store and opens the door
the little bell over the door jingles
kathleen reaches up on her tiptoes for the bell and detaches it
then she comes out of the store carrying the bell
kathleen locks the door and reaches down to operate the grate for the last time
the grate starts to lower
kathleen looks at her store one last time
then she walks off carrying the bell
we hear it jingle in the night
and hold on the shop around the corner and it slowly turns into a computer enhanced version of itself
and then suddenly it vanishes with a poof leaving an empty screen
the trees sprout leaves and birdies start to tweet
and the scene turns into a real version of george is now the head of the children department at the store and he is sitting in the childrens section on
an itty bitty chair
his staff is sitting on little itty bitty chairs too
then in the th century caldecott revolutionized the publishing of childrens books by the introduction of color illustrations we see several are dozing
joe walks past the eleanor roosevelt statue
hes with annabel and matt what about going to the childrens zoo
i dont want to go to the childrens zoo
the staten island ferry
i want to go to the storybook lady
i want to go to the storybook lady
well we cant go to the storybook lady
annabel is sitting in her chair staring glumly at a bowl of japanese soup and noodles
ill read you a story
where did she go
she had to close her store
she didnt have enough business
her store was very close to our store and you know our store sells books at a slightly lower cost why
why do we sell at a lower cost
so more people can buy books
why couldnt she sell that way too
because shes small and were big
how about we go get some candy
so now shes gone and its all your fault
its business annabel
its not personal
how about we go get so much candy youll be bouncing off the walls for days
personal means that shes gone forever and now well never get another book from her as long as we ever live
she burst into tears
matt bursts into tears too
remember the man who worked with her
a wail no
well i hired him
you killed the storybook lady
matt throws himself on the ground crying
annabel sobs hysterically
george is wearing the same pointed hat kathleen wore as the storybook lady
theres a sign that says storybook person
several children are listening
we see shes glowering
kathleen is in bed with a huge box of kleenex
she has a terrible cold
her nose is red her eyes are watery
on the bedside table are a huge assortment of atomizers pills etc
we hear the sound of computer keys clicking
why havent you written
i have a cold
we see joe on his computer
hows your cold
my ears are blocked my nose is clogged
shes drinking cranberry juice
joni mitchell on the stereo
the sound of computer keys clicking again
are you feeling any better
im lying in bed listening to joni mitchell and drinking cranberry juice which i am sorry to say is the exact same color as my nose
i keep thinking about my future
what am i going to do
as joe is walking brinkley back to the boat
a limousine has pulled up near the pier and the driver is unloading bags
joe stops to see the passenger his father nelson fox
what are you doing here
next to joes boat is a larger yacht
in the main cabin joe and nelson are having drinks
nelson lifts his glass in a toast
father and son together at last
that happened with gillian
nelson ignores the question
ive stayed here after lets see your mother laurette that ballet dancer the nanny was she the nanny
i forgot that
then there was the ice skater also the nanny really
how amazingly ironic
sybil the astrologer
whose moon turned out to be in somebody elses house as i recall
just like gillian
gillian ran off with someone
gillian ran off with nanny maureen
thats incredibly ironic
theres no other word for it
who did you break up with
you met her
would i like her
cracks himself up just kidding
isnt this great
have some peanuts
of course i have to live out of a suitcase for a least three weeks and then theres the inevitable legal hassle more of your inheritance down the drain
dont worry about it
but then i get to meet someone new
thats the easy part
oh right a snap to find the one single person in the world who fills your heart with joy
dont be ridiculous
have i ever been with anyone who fits that description
on to the next
isnt it a beautiful night
hold on joe
joe on his way to kathleens apartment building carrying a bunch of daisies wrapped in cellophane
joe goes up the stoop to her building and looks at buzzer
sees kelly a
voice clogged through intercom who is it
kathleen in her pajamas at the intercom horrified
what are you doing here
may i please come up
its really not a good idea
someone else walks up to the door unlocks it and walks in
into the intercom i have a terrible cold can you hear it
im sniffling and not really awake as kathleen continues to talk through the intercom to an empty stoop
and im sleeping practically twenty four hours a day and taking echinacea into intercom and vitamin c so i would really appreciate it if you would come some other time
theres a knock on the door right next to her
kathleen practically jumps out of her skin
she looks through the peephole
there he is
just a second
she puts on a robe runs frantically about picking up various scattered wadded up kleenexs opens the front door
joe is holding a bunch of flowers wrapped in paper
what are you doing here
i heard you were sick and i was worried and i wanted to he hears voices is someone here
just the home shopping network
bought any porcelain dolls
i was thinking about it
beat you put me out of business i know that and now you turn up with flowers
did you come to gloat
to offer me a job no i wouldnt think of because i have plans i have lots of offers
ive been offered a job by well actually by my former
we broke up
thats too bad
you seemed so perfect for each other
she claps her hand over her mouth i dont mean to say things like that
no matter what you have done to me there is no excuse for my saying anything like that
but every time i see you things like that just seem to fly out of your mouth
im starting over
sharply thank you for coming
she says it again a little more nicely thank you for coming
she starts to the door
i bought you flowers
trying as hard as she can thank you
she takes them
he takes them back
why dont i put them in water
he heads for the kitchen
a beat while she stares after him
when kathleen gets to the kitchen joe is checking the kettle for water
turns on the stove
sit down please
he pulls out a kitchen chair
shes a little woozy
he gets out a vase
fills it with water
george says hello
he told me you werent feeling well
how is george
hes revolutionizing the place
no one is allowed to work in his department who doesnt have a ph
in childrens literature
he unwraps the paper around the flowers
puts them in a vase
i love daisies
you told me
he puts the vase on the kitchen table
kathleen plays with the petals
theyre so friendly
dont you think they are the friendliest flower
when did you break up
oh a couple of weeks ago
everyone is breaking up
this other person i know broke up with someone in an elevator
i think it was in an elevator
or just outside it
or after it
it got stuck
and suddenly everything became clear
when i saw you at the coffee place i was waiting for him and i was charming
i was not charming
well you looked charming
the teakettle whistles
joe turns off the burner
he gets out mugs and teabags and pours the water
i was upset
and i was horrible
he puts in two spoonfuls gives it to her
but have no excuse
she picks up the daisies and carries them into joe follows her
they both sit
whereas i am a horrible person and have no choice but to be horrible is that what youre saying
no i am not saying that because i am done saying horrible things even to you
you did it again
she claps her hand over her mouth
i put you out of business
youre entitled to hate me
i dont hate you but youll never forgive me
elizabeth bennet in pride and prejudice
she was too proud i thought you hated pride and prejudice
or was she too prejudiced and mr
darcy too proud
i can never remember
beat it wasnt personal it was business
what is that supposed to mean
i am so sick of that
all it means is its not personal to you but its personal to me its personal to a lot of people
she shrugs helplessly whats wrong with personal anyway
i mean whatever else anything is it ought to begin by being personal
kathleen stands up picks up the daisies
my heads starting to get funny
i have to go back to bed
they walk to
kathleen puts the daisies next to the bed and gets into it
she fluffs up the pillows pulls up the blankets surrounds herself with kleenex and evian and sneezes a gigantic sneeze
why did you stop by
i wanted to be your friend
i knew it wasnt possible
what can i say
sometimes a person just wants the impossible
could i ask you something
what happened with that guy at the cafe
but youre crazy about him yes
then why dont you run off with him
what are you waiting for
a long beat
i dont actually know him
we only know each other oh god youre not going to believe this let me guess
from the internet
youve got mail
very powerful words
joe sits on the edge of the bed
im happy for him
although could i make a little suggestion
i think you should meet him
i take it back
why meet him
starting to get sharp again i hardly think i need advice from someone who he reaches out and gently claps his hand over her mouth
and holds it there
its unexpectedly tender and sexy
i concede i bring out the worst in you but let me help you not to say something youll just torture yourself about for years to come
she starts to smile and he removes his hand
they look at each other
i hope youre better soon
it would be a shame to miss new york in the spring
thank you for the daisies
he starts for the door
we hear the door close
hold on kathleen
christina is running
she sees a good looking male runner coming toward her
she has no hope that he will notice her and starts to look away as they get close to one another
he passes her
christina cant believe it
she does a little dance of joy
camera pulls back as we see her by the reservoir on a beautiful morning doing her little celebratory spin
then she resumes her morning exercise running on
patricia comes in
the place is packed
there are hundreds of young jewish new yorkers singing folk songs and dancing the hora
the rabbi is dancing among them
patricia sees the rabbi leading the dance
the rabbi whirls madly toward her like a human dreidel
he grabs patricias hand and to her surprise they go whirling off together
kathleen at the computer typing
i have been thinking about this and i think we should meet
she clicks the send button and then exits from american on line
on her computer screen we now see the standard screen with several icons american on line word recycle bin etc
she clicks word
she goes to file new
there are several choices of format
she stares at the choices
then she clicks book format
a blank page appears in the computer
she starts to type once upon a time there was a little girl named
she pauses for a moment and looks around the room
she sees the flowers that joe brought her
and then she types daisy
as she goes on typing
on joe typing
we should meet
and we will meet
but im in the middle of a project that needs
he pauses to think of the right word tweaking
a look of calculation on his face
we can see kathleen through the window drinking a cup of coffee
and now we see joe walk into starbucks
he waves at her pretending surprise at seeing her
has he been watching the store and waiting for her to come in
well never know
hes sitting next to her at the counter in the window
thats what he said
hes probably married
thats a terrible thing to say
its not possible
have you asked him if hes married
have you said are you married
joe looks at her shrugs
as she types i know this is probably a little late to be asking but are you married
as he answers am i married
what kind of a question is that
how can you ask me that
dont you know me at all
oh wait i get it
your friends are telling you the reason we havent met is that im married
am i right
kathleen and joe having nachos
so he didnt exactly answer
he did too
he nailed me
he knew exactly what i was up to
which is just like him
but he didnt exactly answer did he
maybe hes fat
i dont care about that
you dont care that he might be one of those guys whos so fat he has to be removed from his house with a crane
thats very unlikely
why else do you think hes putting off meeting you
maybe thats not it
he could be waiting til hes paroled
oh you wont believe this there was a moment when george thought he might be the rooftop killer which was completely ridiculous her voice trails off as she considers whether
it could be true
whats his handle
she shakes her head
come on im not going to write him
is that what you think
one five two
one hundred fifty two
hes years old
he has hairs remaining on his head
hes had moles removed and now he has pockmarks
as they walk past tables of bread and flowers etc
his combined college board scores
the number of women hes slept with
the number of times hes seen the godfather
thats the first good thing ive heard about him
no no no
he would never do anything that prosaic
on joe looking a little wounded
kathleen contd the only thing i really care about besides the married thing
and the jail thing
is the boat thing
the boat thing
i could never be with anyone who has a boat
so that clinches it
well never be together
ill take care of these
he picks up a mango squeezes it
joe contd i could never be with anyone who likes joni mitchell
singing imitating joni its clouds illusions i recall i really dont know clouds at all
what does that mean
joe waits for kathleen to say she likes joni mitchell
but kathleen doesnt say anything
she starts intently picking over apples trying to find some she wants
hows your book coming
as they walk away from the market going uptown
theres a childrens book editor i know from the store and shes excited to read it
when i finish it
who would ever have thought id write
i mean if i didnt have all this free time i would never have discovered she stops realizing what shes saying
kathleen contd the truth is he was the one who made me start thinking about writing mister felony indictments mister
insights into my soul
cant compete with that
i keep bumping into you
hope your mangos ripe
i think it is
want to bump into me saturday
as joe types
how about meeting saturday
the first day of spring
theres a place in riverside park at th street where the path curves and when you come around the curve youll find me waiting
kathleen and joe are putting mustard on their hot dogs
in riverside park
isnt that amazing
maybe ive seen him and i dont even know it
as they walk uptown eating their hot dogs and drinking papaya drinks
he could be the zipper man
this guy on amsterdam who repairs zippers
youll never have to buy new luggage
timing is everything
he waited until you were primed
until you knew there was no other man you could ever love
almost believe it yes
sometimes i wonder
they stop walking they look at each other
if i hadnt been foxbooks and you hadnt been the shop around the corner and wed just met dont
i would have asked for your phone number and i wouldnt have been able to wait hours before calling and asking how about coffee drinks dinner a movie for as
long as we both shall live
almost a swoon joe
and then we would never have been at war
the only fight wed ever have is what video to rent on saturday night
who fights about that
we would never
a long beat
i have to go
she doesnt move
let me ask you something
how come youll forgive him for standing you up and you wont forgive me for a little tiny thing like putting you out of business
kathleen looks at him
shakes her head
they look at each other
oh how i wish you would
its all kathleen can do not to forgive him
its all joe can do not to kiss her
i really do have to go
you dont want to be late
shes in agony
he turns and walks away
after a moment she does too
as we see kathleen come down the street and walk into her house
as she comes out of the apartment house having changed her clothes
as she comes toward the entrance to the park
as kathleen comes down a path in the park near th street
she comes to a stop
a young woman in running clothes passes by
a young father pushing a baby in one of those strollers runners use to push babies in
kathleen looks at her watch
suddenly she hears a noise
a dog barking
and brinkley comes around the corner
and hold on kathleen as she sees
and she starts to cry
and he comes to her
and puts his arms around her
dont cry shopgirl dont cry
i wanted it to be you
i wanted it to be you so badly
and as they kiss we hold on them
and crane up and away as we see them a couple kissing in the park on a beautiful spring day
a dog is leaping around them
and as we get further and further away from them the screen turns into and the dog turns cartwheels and flipflops
