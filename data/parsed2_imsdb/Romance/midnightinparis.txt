written by woody allen we hear voices over gil and inez a young couple of americans engaged to be married as we shall learn
standard locations are listed here but they will be determined later when we location scout
this is unbelievable look at this
theres no city like this in the world
there never was
its become so touristy
well thats just the awful era we live in but can you just imagine what this was like before but even with all the fast food joints and the traffic
god you just cant imagine what it was like years ago
well you like cities
i really do i love cities i love big cities with all the crowds and all the action
having seen a panoramic view of let us say the champs elysee we embark on a montage of the city
the comments offered above and following are an approximation of what the actors feel
look at these places the streets the boulevards
you act like youve never been here before
i dont get here often enough is the problem
every once in a while for a few days is nothing my biggest regret is that i didnt settle here the first time i came
i should have gone with my instincts
i admit its pretty but so are so many other places ive visited
if id have stayed the first time i came by now id be a parisian
pause here for third dialogue exchange im thinking of a painting by pisarro ive seen of paris in the rain
can you picture how drop dead gorgeous this city is in the rain
imagine this town in the twenties paris in the twenties in the rain the artists and writers i was born too late
why did god deliver me into the world in the s and in pasadena yet
why does every city have to be in the rain
whats wonderful about getting wet
or paris when its just getting dark the lights go on or at night its great at night or no sunset on the champs elysees could you ever think of
us moving here after were married
oh god no
i could never live out of the united states
and if i could it would be someplace totally different
i dont know hawaii
hawaii is america
yes but its hawaiian
if i had stayed here and written novels and not gotten into grinding out movie scripts
right and becoming rich and successful
tell me the sad story
but this is where all the artists came to live to work the writers the painters
that was ninety years ago
boy id drop the house in beverly hills the pool everything in a heartbeat
look this is where monet lived and painted were thirty minutes from town
imagine the two of us settling here
if my book turns out we could do it you could just as easily make jewelry here
youre in love with a fantasy
now we cut around and see gil and inez live
im in love with you
kiss gil and inez enter lobby of hotel they are all at
in the lobby they are awaited by her parents john and helen blair
there are our sight seers
if i never see another charming boulevard or bistro what a town
i could easily see myself as a parisien strolling the left bank a baguette under my arm finishing my novel at a table at the cafe flore
a moveable feast hemingway called it
in this traffic nothing moves
well yes it was different then
can we continue this talk of moveable feasts at grand vefour because im starved
americans eat dinner so early
and im proud of it
lifting wine glass a toast to johns new business venture here
well ill be perfectly frank im excited over this corporate merger between our people and the french company but otherwise im not a big francophile
john hates their politics
theyve certainly been no friend to the united states
amiably you cant say they werent right in not backing bushs moronic war in iraq
please lets not get into that discussion yet again
theres nothing wrong with your father and i disagreeing
thats what democracy is
your father defends the right wing of the republican party and i happen to think they represent sub mental neanderthals
but we respect each others views am i right
this last directed at john gets no enthusiasm but a cold look from him can we discuss the wedding plans
your fathers used his good offices with the opera to get some of the singers to attend and sing
i thought puccini would be nice
isnt that great gil
just no wagner
when she walks down the aisle not the ride of the valkyries
hey look i just want to say that i am politically bipartisan in that in my view to be a politician of any party one must of necessity be a
just then another young couple pass the table and recognize inez
paul and carol bates
carol ad lib introductions paul and carol bates mom dad you know gil you didnt mention youd be here
it was sudden
paul got invited to lecture at the sorbonne
oh how terrific
dads here on business and we free loaded along
we can spend some time together
dont we have a lot of commitments
what are you doing tomorrow
were driving to versailles
im dying to see versailles
dont we have something tomorrow
we were going to have lunch at the brasserie lipp
my old professor once actually saw james joyce there
he said joyce was eating sauerkraut and frankfurters
silent pause is that the end of the story
it is actually wed love to go with you guys
versailles is beautiful i have to see it gil its perfect for you with your obsession with les temps perdus yes but its such a lovely treat running into you
as they do their nocturnal ablutions i hope youre not going to be as anti social tomorrow when we go to versailles
how was i anti social
it was so clear you didnt want to go
well theyre your friends and i cant say im as taken with him as you are
i used to have such a crush on him at college
and carols very bright
i find him a pseudo intellectual
i hardly think the sorbo nne would have him lecturing if hes a pseudo intellectual
you should give him your novel to read
im sure hed be able to critique your writing and show you why youre having so much trouble
im having trouble because im a hollywood hack who never gave actual literature a real shot
said with her usual seductiveness gil promise me if this book doesnt come off youll give up beating your brains out and get back to what you do best
inez contd the studios adore you youre in demand i dont think you want to trade everything just to struggle
the two couples are there and paul waxes pedantically as they tour the grounds or inside
i believe louis moved his court here in about originally this was all swamp land in fact if im not mistaken in old french the word versailles means something like
terrain where the weeds have been pulled
the main structure is french classical style at its height the work i believe of louis le vau i think mansart and charles lebrun i believe i think i could
get used to a summer home like this
me too except remember in those days they only had baths and im definitely a shower man
where are you two planning to live after the wedding
were looking in malibu
we love where you live
i keep trying to talk her into a little attic with a skylight in paris la boheme
all thats missing is tuberculosis
he doesnt even know if he can write a novel
so far your track records you know whereas everyone likes your movies yes movie scripts are easier
tell them about the lead character in the book youre working on
i dont like to discuss my work
not the plot just the lead character
he works in a nostalgia shop
whats a nostalgia shop
not one of those stores that sells shirley temple dolls and old radios
i never know who buys that stuff whod want it
pointedly people who live in the past
who think their lives would have been happier if they lived in an earlier time
and just what era would you have preferred to live in miniver cheevy
teasing gil paris in the twenties in the rain when the rain wasnt acid rain
and no global warming no tv or suicide bombing nuclear weapons drug cartels
the usual menu of cliched horror stories
nostalgia is denial
denial of the painful present
hes a romantic
gil would be just fine living in a perpetual state of denial
the name for this fallacy is called golden age thinking
the erroneous notion that a different time period was better than the one ones living in
its a flaw in the romantic imagination of those who find coping with the present too difficult
its definitely the nicest ring weve seen
i love a diamond wedding band
the way it sparkled theyll see it in the last row when he puts it on my finger
this is going to be such an event inez
i only wish cutting her off i dont want to keep going over it mom
look hes your choice
what can i say
gils smart and successful
and yet he talks of g
ng it up and moving here
that frightens me
the world is full of people who dream of writing the great american novel
let me handle him
youre father thinks youre comfortable with gil because you can control him
he likes to please me is that so terrible
oh gosh i have to go paul arranged a private tour of the rodin museum
paul carol gil and inez getting guided tour
guide speaks french and mostly english as she feels
this is of course rodins most famous statue
a cast of this work was placed next to his tomb
rodin wished for it to serve as his headstone and epitaph
that would be in meudon
he died of the flu if im not mistaken i believe
you know your art history monsieur
the design cutting her off the thinker is so powerful because he thinks not just with his brain he thinks with every limb and muscle you feel the concentration
to gil hes so knowledgeable isnt he
so much of rodins work was influenced by his wife camille
yes she was an influence though camille was not the wife but his mistress
rose was the wife
he never married rose
yes in the last year of their lives
i think youre mistaken
are you arguing with the guide
ah non non je suis certaine
im afraid shes right
i just read the recent two volume biography of rodin rose was definitely the wife camille the mistress
you read that
where did you read that
i did no question
dont forget dad invited you to join us at a wine tasting tonight
itll be so fun
pauls an expert on french wines
walking with gil when did you read the biography of rodin
why would i read a biography of rodin
inez already a little high
her parents having fun
gil is also feeling it by now
tasting i cant tell the difference
theyre both delicious
take it easy inez
those little sips add up
you should talk john especially for someone who once advocated the boycott of french wines
ill always take a california wine but the napa valley is six thousand miles away
they laugh and drink
to gil which do you prefer
to me theyre all great
what the hell do i know
i dont think ive ever seen your cheeks so red
pheromones its your pheromones
paul and carol have ambled over having heard gils last amorous remark
ah yes sex and alcohol it fuels the desire but kills the performance according to the bard
have you tasted the
its divine though paul found it what
slightly more tannic than the
i prefer a smoky feeling to a fruity feeling dont you agree
you will admit shes a sexy woman
this i have known for many years
youre a very lucky man
toast paul cont d may you make the transition from movies to literature and may your book glorify all the shirley temple dolls and charlie chaplin wristwatches that make us
nostalgic for an allegedly once simpler more charming world
a bit high to the little green heinz pickle pin
carol and i are going to go dancing we heard of a great place
i dont want to be a party pooper but i just want fresh air
oh come on although if youre just going to sit there and obsess over where the fire exits are
if gil doesnt want to go ill share paul with you
im very democratic
and hes a marvelous dancer
if its okay with you id really just like a little walk and go to bed
we can do it another night
well i can go right
canto im not tired and im dying to dance
ill just meet you back at the hotel
ill take good care of her
i i guess so the three are having a fine time
isnt it great were all on holiday at the same time
back home we just joined a marvelous tennis club and paul says you play
i cant introduce him to tennis daddys having the damndest time pressuring him to learn golf
is he a good writer
have you read his prose
he wont let anybody if he wants id be glad to go over his novel and critique it for him
thats what he needs to have it read by someone who really knows and wouldnt pull any punches
the problem is when it comes to his writing he has no respect for anyones opinion
gil walks street obviously lost
eventually he is at a lovely spot
perhaps by the river the bridge or somewhere else but hes just wandering lost
finally he looks at his watch
either by his watch or a nearby building clock the hands move to exactly midnight
perhaps midnight chimes somewhere
at precisely that moment a car happens to pull up along side him
inside are two men and two woman elegant they have champagne and glasses and they pour from the open bottle and drink happily
come on get in
speaking with french accent lets go were late
you have the wrong person
mais non pas de tout allez montez look im a little drunk cmon for gods sake we cant sit here all night
this is a great old peugeot
i have a friend in beverly hills who has the same one he collects lets go
dragging him in we have so many parties to go to
venez la prochain gauche
here you need some champagne gil gets in
they shut door and pull off
where are we going
rue de tbd address and lets hurry
its not fair my head is swimming from wine
refilling glass of champagne prenez du champagne detendez vous un peu
i do like champagne
the night is young drink up drink up drink up
im drinking up
he drinks befuddled
car pulling up at some great old street
they all get out and take him inside to a party in progress
there is a mixture of elegant plus bohemian types
in the background a man sits at the piano singing a cole porter tune
gil looks at the revelers
a few cuts
finally a woman comes over to gil
glass in hand drinking you look lost
if you count alabama as america which i do
i miss the bathtub gin
what do you do
oh i im a writer
what do you write
right now im working on a novel
im zelda by the way
oh scott scott come over here
heres a writer from where
scott joins scott fitzgerald and who are you old sport
im gil pen oh you two have the same names as as what
scott fitzgerald and drinking scott and zelda fitzgerald
isnt she beautiful
yes its a coincidence
i mean it is a funny coincidence
you have a glazed look in your eye
stunned stupefied anesthetized lobotomized i i i keep thinking that man at the piano believe it or not i recognize his face from some old sheet music what am i
talking about here
i know if i put my mind to it i could be one of the great writers of musical lyrics not that i can write melodies and i try and
then i hear the songs he writes and i realize ill never write a great lyric and that my talent really lies in drinking
yes but he didnt write that song did he
thats not possible what kind of books do you write
i i i im im working on a exactly where am i
im sorry dont you know the host
some friends have gotten together a little party for jean cocteau

i know what youre thinking this is boring i agree im ready to move on lets do bricktops scott im bored hes bored were all bored
whatever you say sweetheart
see if cole and linda want to come with
gil stares open mouthed
shot of group gil cole porter fitzgeralds piled into period open top car tearing down a parisian street
note we can include denise and doug or phil if we want the group is watching someone like josephine baker
gil is stunned by it all
the fitzgeralds drink a lot
group entering cafe
a little late night cafe very bohemian
scott zelda and gil enter the group having thinned out
the fitzgeralds drink a lot
une bouteille de bourbon
stops at another table greetings and salutations
youll forgive me ive been mixing grain and grappa this is gil gil
hey is this some kind of a you liked my book
liked i loved everything you wrote yes it was a good book because it was an honest book and thats what war does to men and theres nothing fine and
noble about dying in the mud unless you die gracefully and then its not only noble but brave
ernest hemingway this is i introduces his drinking partner say hello to pender the bulls in the ring dont frighten belmonte hes killed many brave ones
fine brave bulls
im sure good bulls true bulls why are you smiling
drinks in new york you cant buy this it can only be made in a bathtub and some of the bathtub mixtures are damn good to zelda isnt that so
she prefers her hootch from a homemade still more kick
to hemingway did you read my story
what did you think
it began well really well then it became weak
i mightve known youd hate it
darling youre too sensitive
you liked the story but he hates me
there was some fine writing but it was not fulfilled
please old sport you make matters extremely difficult
im jumpy suddenly i dont like the atmosphere here anymore
to belmonte where are you going
para reunirse con amigos en el st
hes going to st
im going with him
zelda if youre going to stay and drink with him im going with the toreador
to a polite belmonte get her back at a reasonable time
shell drive you crazy this woman
shes exciting and she has talent
this month its writing last month it was something else
youre a writer you need time to write not all this playing around shes wasting you because shes really a competitor dont you agree
i just met speak up for christs sake
im asking you if you think my friend is making a tragic mistake
actually i dont know the fitzgeralds that well youre a writer you make observations you were with them all night
can we not discuss my personal life in public
she has him on yachts at parties jumping into swimming pools youre wasting your talent
you dont understand her
to gil shes jealous of his gift and its a damn fine gift
you like his work
you can speak freely
you like mark twain
i do very much
im going to find zelda
i dont like the thought of her with the spaniard
stumbles out hes a fine writer fitzgerald
what are you writing
a man who works in a nostalgia shop
what the hells a nostalgia shop
where they sell old things memorabilia
does that sound terrible to you
no subject is terrible if the story is true
if the prose is clean and honest and if it affirms courage and grace under pressure
would you do me the biggest favor in the world i cant even ask what
would you read it
its only about four hundred pages if you could just give me your opinion
my opinion is i hate it
if its bad ill hate it because i hate bad writing and if its good ill be envious and hate it all the more
you dont want the opinion of another writer
but theres no one i really trust to evaluate it writers are competitive
i could never compete with you youre too self effacing its not manly
if youre a writer declare yourself the best writer but youre not the best as long as im around
unless you want to put the gloves on and settle it
no no thats okay i wont read your novel but ill tell you what ill do
ill bring it over to gertrude stein
shes the only one i trust to read my work
no one discovers new talent like gert whether its poetry painting music shell tell you if you have a book or not
you could have gertrude stein read my novel
give it to me
i have to get it
its at the hotel
she gets back from spain tomorrow
rises im so thrilled my heart is beating
ill go home and get it ill give it to you i cant tell you what this means to me
to have gertrude stein read my novel thank you thank you he exits the place
calm yourself get a grip gil deep breaths been quite a night fitzgerald hemingway the hemingway papa where do i meet him he never said
gil goes to return to the cafe he cant find the door nor the club facade
we are in the present and he searches the wall of a facade where he came out but he is in despair over the fact he cant find it
gil and inez probably dressing
lucky you didnt go last night
youd have hated the music and the crowd but i had fun
what are you thinking
you seem in a daze
if i told you i was with ernest hemingway and scott fitzgerald last night what would you say
is that what you were dreaming about
your literary idols
but if i wasnt dreaming what does that mean
canto if i told you i spent time with hemingway and fitzgerald and cole porter id be thinking brain tumor
can i tell you zelda fitzgerald is exactly as weve come to know her from articles and books shes mercurial and moody and she does not get along with hemingway
and scott knows hemingways right about it but you can see how conflicted he is because he loves her right right er wheres my cold cream we should knock off the idle chatter because were going to be late
actually i wanted to stay and work on my novel it needs a little polishing
you can work on it later
and we can use moms decorators discount
helen inez and gil in antique store
come look at this inez wouldnt this be charming for a malibu beach house
dix huit mille
to inez its a steal at eighteen thousand dollars
eighteen thousand dollars
oh wait thats euros so its more thats over twenty thousand dollars mom
yes but its very hard to find anything like this at home
shes right gil
yes but we havent even found a house yet and im trying to keep expenses down so i can turn down jobs
you get what you pay for
cheap is cheap
i know you love malibu but sotto seductively did you ever make love in a chaise like this
imagine the possibilities
er of course when you think of it that way it does help amortize the eighteen grand
and dont forget were taking you to dinner tonight at tbd
sotto to inez and after i have a terrific surprise for you
im not big on surprises
you will be
look at these marvelous blackamoors
i see them in your living room
cut to l gil and inez arriving at the spot he was picked up by car
he waits nervously
where are you taking me
you made me rush through dinner
dad wasnt finished with his profiteroles
youre going on one of the most amazing adventures of your life
and why are you carrying around your manuscript
youll see youll see and your jaw will drop
theyre still waiting with nothing happening
cars pass but no action
i dont know what it is youre carrying on about but this is not my idea of an amazing adventure
im exhausted from the gym and the massage
canto look you want to walk the streets and drink in paris by night go ahead
im in the middle of a great book carol lent me and if im asleep when you get in dont wake me
she gets in cab to himself what am i doing wrong
unless shes right and i need to see a neurologist
left the wine tasting a little high yes right here
the clock begins to chime midnight
i remember the river the clock struck midnight i the clock struck midnight
yes on the dot of midnight i he looks at his watch which obviously confirms the chimes he hears
the period car comes the door opens
we hear hemingways voice hemingway v
gil gets in car pulls off only gil and hemingway
the assignment was to take the hill
there were four of us
hemingway contd five if you counted vincente but he had lost his hand when a grenade went off and he couldnt fight as he could when i first met him
and he was young and brave and the hill was soggy from days of rain and sloped down toward a road and there were many german soldiers on the road and the idea was to aim at the first group and if our aim was true we could delay them
werent you scared
youll never write well if you fear dying
its my biggest fear
but its something all men before you have done and all men will do
yes but have you ever made love to a truly great woman
my fiance is very sexy
and when you make love to her you feel true and beautiful passion and you at least for that moment lose your fear of death
i dont know about that canto i believe that love thats true and real creates a respite from death
all cowardice comes from not loving or not loving well which is the same thing and when the man who is brave and true looks death squarely in the face
like some rhino hunters i know or belmonte who is truly brave it is because they love with sufficient passion to push death out of their minds till it returns as it does to all men and then you must make really good love again
think about it
shot of them arriving at gertrude steins
this is gil pender
hes a young american writer
i thought you two should know each other
im glad youre here
you can help decide which of us is right and which of us is wrong
she leads them into other room introduces gil
this is gil pender
they ad lib greetings
picasso speaks french and is with a beautiful girl adriana
i was just telling pablo that this portrait doesnt capture adriana
it has universality but no objectivity
vous ne le comprenez pas correctment
vous ne connaissez pas adriana mais cest tout ce qui la represente
no tu na pas raison
look how hes done her dripping with sexual innuendo
carnal to the point of smoldering and yes shes beautiful but its a subtle beauty an implied sensuality
to gil what is your first impression of adriana
very taken exceptionally lovely
belle mais plus subtil plus implicite pablo
youre right gertrude of course you can see why hes lost his objectivity
flirting with her youve made a creation of place pigalle a whore with volcanic appetites
mais cest comme elle est si vous la connaissez
yes avec vous en prive because shes your lover but we dont know her that way so you make a petit bourgeoise judgment and turn her into an object of
stein contd cest plus comme une nature morte quon portrait
its more like a still life than a portrait
waves her off and goes to get a drink je ne suis pas daccord
turning to gil and what about this book of yours ive been hearing about
to hemingway have you read it
no this i leave to you
youve always been the best judge of my work
thumbing first page she reads out of the past was the name of the store and its products consisted of memories
what was prosaic and even vulgar to one generation had been transmuted by the mere passing of years to a status at once magical and also camp
i love it
im already hooked
ill start it tonight
but first we have something to talk about
she collars hemingway and they huddle to one side
picasso has busied himself at a distant spot with a drink sulking
this leaves gil off with adriana to chat
did my opening lines really get to you that strongly
the past has always had a great charisma for me
i was born too late
for me belle epoque paris would have been perfect
the whole sensibility the street lamps the kiosks the horse and carriages
and maxims then
you speak very good english
no not really
yes and how long have you been dating picasso
my god did i say that
oh i no i didnt mean anything you know to pry born in paris
i was born in bordeaux i moved here to study fashion and you dont want to hear this no i do
i came here to study with coco chanel and i fell in love with paris and also a very dark eyed haunted jewish italian painter and i knew amedeo had
another woman but still i couldnt resist moving into his apartment when he asked and it was a beautiful six months
was it modigliani
you lived with modigliani
you asked me so im telling you my sad story
with braque also there was another woman many and now with pablo i mean pablo is married but every day its on again off again i dont know how any
woman can stay with him hes so difficult
my god you are a whole different level of art groupie
nothing im but tell me about yourself
have you come to paris to write because these days so many americans feel the need to move here
isnt hemingway attractive
i love his writing
actually im visiting
oh you must stay here
its a wonderful city for artists and writers
believe me i want to but its not that simple
and i did fall madly in love with the start of your book so i want to hear the rest of it
hemingway and stein return
come lets all go for a drink up at montmartre
well discuss your book as soon as i finish it
where can i reach you
oh thats okay ill drop by itll be easier for you if thats okay
we run an open house
you sure you wont come
checks watch i only wish i could but i cant but hopefully ill see you again that would be nice
hemingway picasso and adriana are going off hemingway flirtatious with her
teasing picasso one of these days i plan to steal you away from this genius whos great but no miro
gil gets into bed with inez
shes asleep and he lies awake thinking
he pinches himself to make sure hes awake
to himself im gil pender i was with hemingway and picasso pablo picasso ernest hemingway im gil pender from pasadena the cub scouts i failed freshman english im gil pender
and my novel is with gertrude stein i once worked at the house of pies
im little gil pender
and that girl was so lovely
gil inez and helen
its a shame you two didnt come to the movies last night
we saw a wonderfully funny american film
i forget the name
wonderful but forgettable
ive seen that picture
i know it was moronic and infantile and lacking any wit or believability but john and i laughed in spite of ourselves
what time did you get in
i was dead asleep
i find these midnight strolls are very good for me creatively without the distractions of the day ill probably take another long walk tonight
oh how about this
oh look at these wonderful glass figures
as theyre preoccupied gil is caught up by a woman who plays some old records on an old phonograph and shes playing the cole porter tune cole was playing the
cest jolie no
yes very beautiful
vous aimez you like cole porter
love his music were very close cole linda and i
she gives him a look
very pretty and tres amusant
inez comes over
gil gil gil
coming out if realizing shes been talking to him huh
we should go
were meeting paul and carol for a private showing at the museum
with the same sharp guide
its a different museum and we dont need a guide
pauls an expert on monet
inez contd we can see all those beautiful water lilies at his home
paul carol inez and gil in circular room with huge monets
the juxtaposition of color is amazing
this man was the real father of abstract expressionism
i take that back maybe turner
i prefer monet
i mean i love turner but this is overwhelming
if im not mistaken it took him two years to complete this
and he worked out at giverny where he frequently they say monet used to shhh
i want to hear what pauls saying
he was frequently visited by caillebotte an artist i personally feel was underrated
i find monet almost too pretty like renoir sometimes its cloying
coming to picassos portrait of adriana ah now heres a superb picasso
gil is stunned
if im not mistaken he painted this marvelous portrait of his french mistress madeline brissou in the twenties
er i have to differ with you on this one
gil pay attention and youll learn something
if im not mistaken this was a failed attempt to capture a young french girl named adriana from bordeaux if my art history serves me came to paris to study
costume design for the theatre
believe she had a brief affair with modigliani then braque thats where pablo met her er picasso
youd never know it from this portrait but shes quite subtly beautiful
what have you been smoking
and id hardly call the picture superb
its more of a petit bourgeoise statement of how pablo er picasso sees her saw her hes distracted by the fact she was a volcano in the sack
john helen and inez finishing fancy dinner
too rich for me
where did gil run off to
work he likes to walk around paris the way the city is all lit up at night allegedly inspires him its okay
paul and i are going dancing
in bed with a bad oyster
rising see you later
thanks for dinner dad
where does gil go every night
you heard her
he walks and gets ideas
you sound skeptical
i dont know
i see what he earns but sometimes i think hes got a part missing
and i didnt like his remark about tea party republicans
theyre decent people who want to take back the country theyre not crypto fascist airhead zombies
did you hear him say that
nevertheless i hardly think your idea of having him followed is practical
id like to know where he goes every night
well we know one thing he doesnt go dancing
gil dancing with a woman at fitzgeralds party
he stops finally and adriana wanders over
how nice youre here
i was at gertrude steins shes almost finished with my novel
and the fitzgeralds invited me over and said youd be here you and pablo
pablos home we had a bit of a quarrel
but you looked like you were having fun dancing with djuna barnes
that was djuna barnes
no wonder she wanted to lead
isnt this a wonderful place to throw a party only the fitzgeralds would think of it
look this is from the turn of the century
everything was so beautiful then
hemingway coming over now
he squeezes adriana playfully flirtatious
isnt this little parisienne dream a movable feast
mark my words im going to steal you from that fugitive from malaga one way or the other
hemingway contd referring to his companion of the moment between belmonte and myself which of us would you choose
vous etes tous deux tres impressionants
but he has more courage
he faces death more directly and more often and if you chose him i would be disappointed but understand
por desgracia para ambos ella ha elegido pablo
yes shes chosen picasso but pablo thinks women are only to paint or sleep with
i think women are the equal of men in courage
have you ever shot a charging lion
have you ever hunted
to gil have you
only for bargains
to hemingway venga tomemos otra copa
to adriana would you like to maybe take a walk
gil and adriana walk
i hope it was nothing serious with you and pablo
hes moody and possessive
artists are all like children
i understand why they all want to paint you youre so damn interesting to look at in a lovely way
and youre interesting in a lost way
tell me more about your book
i dont want to talk about my book
i want to enjoy paris by night
i keep forgetting youre only a tourist
thats putting it mildly
adriana is showing him around
i can never decide whether paris is more beautiful by day or by night
theres no book or painting or symphony or sculpture that can rival a great city
all these streets and boulevards as a special art form
gil contd when you think in the cold violent meaningless universe paris exists these lights i mean nothings happening on jupiter or neptune or out beyond but from way out
in space you can see these lights in the whole dark void the cafes people drinking and dancing i mean for all we know this town is the hottest spot in the entire universe vous avez lame dun poete
youre very kind
i would not call my babbling poetic
gil and adriana are here with the street lined with prostitutes
see anything you like
im ashamed to admit im attracted to all of them
i like cheap sexy
i know its shallow
when i was in catholic school one weekend my roommate and i paid one of the girls of pigalle to come teach us all her tricks
well thats the most interesting thing ive ever heard in my life id like to think about that for awhile
gil and adriana walking by the river
i love that the main character in your book sells memories
because he believes in his soul that progress is not automatically for the better
often quite the opposite
say is that who i think it is
what is she doing here
and why is she staring into the river
they see a distraught woman contemplating jumping into the river
upon running to her its zelda
my god what are you doing
please leave me alone
i dont want to live
what is it
whats going on
it all became clear to me tonight
scott and that beautiful countess it was so obvious they were whispering about me and the more they drank the more he fell in love with her
scott loves only you
i can tell you with absolute certainty
no hes tired of me
no youre wrong
but you just met us
how can you know anything
my skin hurts
i hate the way i look
pill what is this
a valium itll calm you down
you carry medicine
only since inez and i became engaged
ive had these anxiety attacks im sure after the wedding theyll subside
i never heard of valium
what is this
er its the pill of the future
but pills wear off and then it all comes back
no i wont kill myself
ill write and ill write more passionately than scott
ill work harder
he loves you
hes not with that woman
shes already on her way back to rome
ill try and score some more for you
and i have some xanax at the hotel its another one youll like
come on well find a taxi
well see you home things will be better in the morning
you never said you were getting married
yes i i mean its in the future
well good luck with your book and your wedding
youd like inez she has a sharp sense of humor and shes sexy not that we agree on everything
but the important things
actually the small things the important things we dont shed like to live in malibu and that id work in hollywood but i will say we both like er er
indian food not all indian food pita bread we both like pita bread rising i should go
pablo will be missing me
ill walk you home no no finish your drink
i live just around the corner
no i wouldnt think id prefer to be by myself for awhile
thank you for this evening
and she goes
hes stressed thinks
presently salvador dali comes to table
we met earlier tonight
at the party
yes i remember dali si
une bouteille de vin rouge i waiter scurries for one
you like the shape of the rhinoceros
i never thought about it
i paint rhinoceros
i paint you sad eyes big lips melting over hot sand with one tear yes and in your tear christs face
im sure i look sad
im in a very perplexing situation
everyone is in perplexing situation to be or not to be this is ultimate perplexing question you agree
ah here they are bufiuel man ray enter and the table enlarges as they sit
dali introduces them to gil
my god i own a surrealist print only a print by magritte
pender pen der pen derrr and i am da li
pender is in perplexing situation
it sounds so crazy when i say it and youll think im drunk but ive got to tell someone im from a different time a whole other era the future
and i pass from the two thousandth millennium to here a car picks me up i slide through time exactly correct you inhabit two worlds so far i see nothing strange
look youre sur realists but im a normal guy see in one life im engaged to marry a woman i love at least i think i love her
christ im supposed to love her if im marrying her
love the word love love the word love same as the word rhinoceros the rhinoceros makes love by mounting the female but is there difference in beauty between two rhinoceroses
but there is nothing more sur real than the human heart
past is also present
in a dream which is fine for you because you guys dabble in dreams
there is another woman
adriana is her name
and i felt drawn to her but it wouldnt matter men much greater than me profound artists shes drawn to geniuses and they to her
i see you with christ he is smiling while you are crucified on the heavy wooden cross of self doubt
of course my biggest problem is reality
bunuel reality is nothing more than a dream we all exist in the dream of a dog
i was born in the wrong time
time is all the mind
time melts the watches melt the hands of the clock melt a man in love with a woman from a different era
i see a photograph
bunuel i see a movie
i see an insurmountable problem
i see a rhinoceros
room service breakfast
did you get much work done last night
er some yes im beginning to think my book may be too realistic that ive missed some chances to let my imagination run wild and not be so damn logical
shouldnt we be getting dressed
cmere you always look great in the morning
she does well be late
i have to work
im working like a demon but i cant resist you half dressed like that
paul says we have to see the countryside
hes taking us for lunch at this beautiful little inn
i know you like making love in the morning but i find it much sexier late afternoon just before we go out to dinner
except i always have to explain to my parents why your cheeks look radiant
hey im not going to force you
i know youre hot on your writing
ill be happy when you finish this book and move on
gil is near the kiss
he has tracked down the guide
hello bonjour id like to ask you a question about rodin
he loved his wife he also loved his mistress is it really possible to be in love with two women
he loved both in different ways
god its so french
er you remember me
qui you were with the group the pedantic gentleman
yeah pedantic perfect word
youre very observant
i need some advice
id like a womans take
a french woman an observant french woman
i met some woman that i very quickly became smitten with
im engaged to be married
i know rodin had a wife and a mistress but im american we cant handle that were monogamous
youre engaged and you met a new woman yes
her names adriana
right now shes living with picas with a spaniard er he paints fairly well
yes and does she love him
love him or me
well i hardly think me
but weve just met
see another very gifted man flirts with her a writer
all these geniuses fall in love with her
and what am i
and then of course theres another big problem
i cant exactly explain
i dont know whether to call it an age difference or a problem of geography im so messed up
im not hemingway im not picasso im not rodin
im just a guy who was born too late
john walks down a street and enters a building
as he goes up the stairs we learn it is the office of a private detective agency
john and m
dubois the head detective
tisserant the second is present too
heres his photo
i want to know where he goes each night
what is your suspicion
hes engaged to my daughter to marry and i want to be certain shes making a wise decision
naturally discretion is paramount
youve come to the right place monsieur
monsieur tisserant will personally keep track of the gentleman and report back on his whereabouts at night
gil getting into the car as usual at the same spot at midnight
another man is in there
tisserant is observing from his car
gets in thanks for stopping
tom stearns t
shot of gil entering car
im stunned stunned prufrock my mantra as the car pulls off we hear gil speaking
may i tell you where i come from they measure out their lives in coke spoons
picasso present dour
oh pender ill get to your book in a moment
i finished it
were just in the middle of a little personal crisis
i didnt mean to intrude
no its no secret
adriana has left pablo and has flown to africa with ernest hemingway
sabia que tenia una obsesi n con este fanforr n
sobre esto discutimos
estoy seguro que regresara muy devoto
english to gil he took her hunting kudu but shell be back to him the sound of hyenas every night when youre trying to sleep in a tent gets on
your nerves pretty quickly
kilimanjaro is not paris
theyre on mt
now about your book
very unusual indeed
in a way its almost science fiction fiction with all the futuristic devices television sets supersonic flight and yet its not typical science fiction its unique
stein contd nevertheless you have to get rid of all that technology whats good about your book are the characters the human questions love mortality nobody cares about the technology
they care about the human heart
we all fear death and question our place in the universe
unfortunately your book lapses into easy pessimism
i was having this conversation with giacometti the other day hes such a gloom monger
still those sculptures its the artists job not to succumb to despair but to find an antidote to the emptiness of existence
i find your voice clear and lively dont be such a defeatist
inez her mother and father loading into car
tell gil to bring a suit because tomorrow night well be dining formal
i forgot to tell you
gil is not going with us to mont st
i dont understand it
he writes he rewrites he rewrites his rewrites
he says picasso never left his studio
inez contd i said gil you have absolutely nothing in common with picasso he just looks at me
well hes going to miss a great weekend
he listens to the old phonograph recordings
any cole porter
oh yes i remember he was your friend
i was kidding you realize
i did realize
youre a bit young
im surprised youre so familiar with his work
he wrote many songs about paris very beautiful
yes he was in love with your hometown
youre a parisiene
dix huit euro
gil at a place that has a bin of various old books more pretty than great the kind people buy for the binding or plates
he picks up a pretty bound but totally wrecked book in the inside
it is slim leather torn up
he reads the title page in hand writing
it reads this diary belongs to adriana dupree
to customer can you translate this
gil with museum guide
shes translating the diary into english
reading that paris exists and anyone could choose to live anywhere else in the world will always be a mystery to me
continuing dinner with pablo and henri matisse
pablo is the greater artist although matisse is the greater painter
continuing paris in the summer what it must have been like to sit opposite ones lover at maxims in its heyday
pages are torn and text cuts off
continuing i am in love with an american writer i just met named gil pender
his eyes widen
continuing that immediate magic one hears about happened to me
i know that both picasso and hemingway are in love with me but for whatever inexplicable reasons the heart has i am drawn to gil
perhaps because he seems naive and unassuming
continuing as always in this sad life he is about to marry a woman named inez
i had a dream where he came to me and brought me a little gift earrings they were and we made love
perhaps it is just as well i accept hemingways offer to go to africa
life with pablo is too full of conflict and i am suffocating under his genius
why i need to go from one brilliant man to another is my weakness
gil is different perhaps not a genius but not moody and selfish like pablo or amedeo was
i think a trip to africa with hemingway would help get these feelings for gil off my mind
finished reading i dont understand
what is this
its a little complicated to explain
thanks for translating the writer clearly has feelings for this man gil
thats your name no
she finds him no genius naive and unassuming thats not exactly dazzling
to some women naivete is endearing
and shes romantic
she dreams of belle epoque paris and a gift of earrings and making love with this man
gil stares thinking
gil is sprucing up
he douses himself with aftershave checks clock
its eleven pm
to himself eleven lets see where the hell am i going to get earrings at this hour
thinks i must improvise
he goes to inezs jewelry box and picks out art nouveau earrings he knows adriana would like
he grabs a box and gift wraps it quickly
maybe it comes in a blue velvet box and he finds some colored paper
gil writes card to adriana with love
he crosses it out to adriana avec amour
he gives a final check to himself and opens door to leave running smack into inez and both her parents home from their trip prematurely
ohmigodl what are you doing back
daddy got chest pains
im sure its indigestion
well we cant take a chance
daddy had an angioplasty three years ago
they put a balloon in me
phone yes i want the hotel doctor suite
she trails off why are you so dressed up
no i was just writing
you dress and put on cologne to write
i took a break and showered
i think better in the shower
all those positive ions
we were halfway to mont
michele and daddy started to look pale
we turned right around
no sure is there anything i can get you john
im sure its the beef bourguignon
picking up gift grabs it from her its nothing nothing what is that
its a present
yes yes it is
because its gift wrapped but er youre not supposed to see that its a surprise
you got me something
its nothing great from the flea market
let me open it
no not now i got it for i mean to give it to you at a special dinner just leave it now im dying of curiosity
if its jewelry i hope its my taste not like the moonstone necklace
you didnt like the moonstones
theyre understated yet elegant to helen dont you always say that ha ha
cheap is cheap is what i always say
you never saw the necklace he got me
ive never actually worn it
youll see why immediately
opens her jewelry box holds up moonstones
i thought youd like their simplicity
thats just it theyre too simple
hey where are my art nouveau earrings
you probably didnt pack them
ive worn them here
i guess you lost them
they probably dropped off
both of them
my ears are pierced
i told you to keep everything in the hotel safe
you think it was the maid
its always the maid
i remember seeing them there this morning
i would report the theft right away
ill bet it was that maid
she was so snotty yesterday about turning out the beds
she goes to phone
gee i wouldnt jump to any conclusions
i mean an accusation of theft
phone i want to report a theft
id like the house detective to please come to room
oh god hangs up i didnt like that maid from the first day didnt i say that
the maid was very sweet
opening door doctor is there right
take the side of the help as usual
thats why dad calls you a communist
come in hes right there im fine
hes had an angioplasty
amidst the ad lib moment gil has managed to secure a private spot and has swiped the box
hes torn it open and removing earrings runs into the room with them
are these what youre missing
where did you find them
they were in the bathroom
right out on the sink
i was in the bathroom i didnt see them
well youre under stress why the hell would they be in the bathroom
maybe you thought you put them away and left them out or dropped them and the maid found them and left them out where you could see them easily
i didnt drop them or leave them out
the main thing is theyre not stolen
im going to send you for some tests but i think that you are right and this is only indigestion
incidentally it was very nice of you to come over so late
yes my god is it midnight already
gil is disappointed
gil is buying earrings
he is behind the wheel of his car observing
car stops picks up gil pulls off
tisserant pulls off to follow
to matisse cest lun de vos meilleurs jusqua present
je parlai a leo
je pense quil souhaite lacheter
matisse is delighted goes about his business there as she turns to gil
i was just telling matisse we want to buy one of his new pictures for our personal collection
five hundred francs seems fair
five hundred francs
for a matisse
half to himself gil contd gee why dont i pick up half a dozen
i could clean up but hows all this possible i should have paid more attention in my physics class well
oh er i brought a rewrite of the first few chapters of my book and was hoping you would tell me if you thought i was on the right track
leave it with me
er have you heard from hemingway
oh yes theyve been back for days
the trip didnt work out
i knew they wouldnt hit it off
with picasso too
shes at deyrolles by herself
on of those surrealist painters is getting married and they did it up there
shell be glad to see you
wedding in progress
informal non traditional wedding with artist type guests
gil finds adriana
oh what are you doing here
i came to find you
lets just say as a writer i see into womens souls and i sense that you have very complicated feelings towards me
but youre going to be married
im not so sure about anything anymore can we just go where its quiet
they are almost out the door when they run into luis bufiuel
bufiuel i had a nice idea for a movie for you
a group of people are at a formal dinner party and after dinner when they try to leave the room they cant
bunuel why not
they just cant seem to exit the door
bunuel but why
and because theyre all forced to stay together the veneer of civilization quickly comes off them and they behave as who they really are animals
bunuel but i dont get it why dont they just walk out of the room
just think about it thats all im saying maybe one day youll be shaving and itll tickle your fancy
they go off as bufiuel gets in last line
bunuel i dont understand whats holding them in the room
gil and adriana at romantic locale
he kisses her
what are you doing
i dont know but i do know that for a brief moment when i was doing it i felt immortal
but you look so sad
because life is too mysterious for me
its the time we live in
everything moves so fast life is noisy and complicated not like the belle epoque
in those years paris lived only for beauty
ive always been a logical person
i never took chances did anything crazy like move here when i first came or take a shot at being a real writer not a hollywood hired hand but i
feel like letting everything go
gil gives her earrings
how remarkable theyre beautiful
a horse and carriage pulls up
monsieur mademoiselle on y vas
who are you
on y vas
nous allons etre en retard
whats going on
they get in
where are we going
to drink champagne
they pull up at maxims
people from the belle epoque enter and exit
this is so beautiful
all those pictures ive seen of belle epoque paris
were herel i dont know what it is about this city but i must write a thank you note to the chamber of commerce
welcome and oh what marvelous outfits
so avant garde please have some champagne
i cant believe this is happening to me
gil and adriana are dancing romantically
i never want to go back to the present
the present yes the present always seems worse than the past but it cant be to always think this generation is stupider and coarser than the last and yet here
we are at maxims tonight and yes its fabulous
and i know just where i want to go after
the girls dance
gil and adriana sit and hold hands
dance ends and girls run off
to waiter encore du vin
le meme chose
to gil isnt this something
lookl look i she points out lautrec sketching
pablo worships him
i have to say hello
come with me im nervous
we shouldnt bother him
but we know hes a lonely man he longs for company
they go over
she speaks to lautrec
were both great admirers of your work
nous sommes tout les deux de grands admirateurs de votre travail
pouvons nous vous offrir un verre
jen serai enchante mademoiselle
prenez un siege je vous en prie
hes asking us to sit down with him
this much french i know
etes vous americain
oui je lai devine a votre accent
nous aimons tous les vos dessins et peintures en realite tout ce que vous faites
yes i love your pictures too
welcomes two new men to table oh puis je vous presenter mes amis monsieur degas and monsieur gauguin
ohmigoodness hello enchante ad lib hellos best they can to gil isnt this thrilling
you see the sketch hes made
nobody can draw like that today not pablo not matisse we see fine drawing lautrec style
referring to gauguin parle un petit peut
i speak well je parle tres bien
scornfully over gauguins boasting ah degas and i were just talking about how cette generation est depourvue de sens et mangue dimagination
he says they find this generation sterile and empty la renaissance est beaucoup mieux better to have lived during the renaissance
no this is the golden age lage dor
pas do tout la renaissance cetait mieux leur vetements sont tres tres modernes tres originaux
he says your clothes are very modern and original
er yes monsieur lauren ralph
to gauguin shouldnt you be in tahiti
yes i live on the island a much better life than here better there but then i miss paris up and back quest que vous faites dans la vie
what do i do
je suis etudiante
en haute couture fashion designer but studying ah ga compte pour les vetements outrageux
vous devriez la presenter a richard
he wants degas to have you meet his friend richard
gauguin cont d hes looking for someone to do costumes for the ballet
ballet costumes my god i dont live here
i mean i do but i dont
je nhabite pas ici
i wouldnt get into too many details with them
lets just leave it that were temporarily passing through
to gil can i speak with you a minute
to table permettez moi de mabsenter un instant
she gets him off lets never go back to the twenties
what are you talking about
i think we should stay here its the start of the belle epoque this is the greatest most beautiful era paris has ever known
but i love the jazz age
the twenties are full of strife and uncertainty
but think of it gil the two of us in a lovely art nouveau home ill work in the fashion world i love the styles you can write its the
age of debussy and guimard
maybe you can meet balzac
but what happened to the twenties and the charleston and cole porter
thats the present its dull
its not the present for me im from
what do you mean
i dropped in on you just the way we dropped in on the s
i wanted to escape my present just like you wanted to escape yours
to a golden age
surely you dont think the twenties are a golden age
to me they are
but im from the twenties and im tellin you the golden age is the belle epoque
yes but dont you see to these guys the golden age was the renaissance
theyd all trade the belle epoque to paint alongside michelangelo or titian
and those guys probably imagine life was better when kubla khan was around
im having an insight
a minor one but that accounts for the anxiety of my dream
last night i dreamed i ran out of zithromax and then i went to the dentist and there was no novacaine these people have no antibiotics what are you talking
and even in the twenties no dishwashers no if your appendix bursts no movies on demand but if we love each other what does it matter when we live
because if you stay here and this becomes your present sooner or later youll imagine another time was really the golden time
and so will i im beginning to see why it cant work adriana
the present has a hold on you because its your present and while theres never any progress in the most important things you get to appreciate what little progress is
made the internet pepto bismol
the present is always going to seem unsatisfying because life itself is unsatisfying thats why gauguin goes back and forth between paris and tahiti searching its my job as a
writer to try and come up with reasons why despite life being tragic and unsatisfying its still worth it
thats the problem with writers youre all so full of words but im more emotional
im going to stay and live in paris most glorious time
you made a choice to leave paris once and you regretted it
yes that one i regretted but it was a real choice and i made the wrong one
this is a choice between accepting reality or surreal insanity
so finally you do love inez more than me
no i love you but this way lies madness and if im ever going to write anything worthwhile ive got to get rid of my illusions and that id be
happier in the past is one of them
they kiss she turns and goes to the table of artists
gil being admitted to the stein home
he is full of energy
ah pender i read your rewrite
yes youre nicely on the right track
youve understood me clearly
if the rest of the book reads as well when youre done youll have something of value
taking it back thank you
i cant tell you how much this means to me
hemingway who read your chapters and agrees its going to be a fine book did have one plot suggestion
hemingway read it
what was his suggestion
canto he finds it hard to believe the protagonist doesnt see his fiancee is having an affair thats going on right before his eyes
with the other character the pedantic one its called denial
to passing poet youre ezra pound right
eliot says you owe him forty francs
gil back in present in mid argument with inez
youre crazy paul and me
where did you get such an insane notion
from ernest hemingway
he thought it out and it makes perfect sense
gil your brain tumors acting up again
theres nothing crazy about ernest hemingway or gertrude stein or fitzgerald or salvador dali nothing except theyve all been dead for years
it was william faulkner who said the past is not dead
gil contd in fact its not even past
actually i ran into bill faulkner at a party
youre a raving lunatic
i guess im too trusting
im jealous and also trusting cognitive dissonance scott fitzgerald speaks of it
gil i know it inez you can fool me but not hemingway
jesus christ im dealing with a madman okay paul and i had a few nights alone
we danced we drank you were always working hes very attractive he spoke to me in french the whole mystique of this corny city got to me its over
we can put this all in perspective at home
im not going back
im staying here
its not the romantic fling
paris is paris
its that im not in love with you
a lot has happened to me since we got here
i wont begin to bore you but i know what that feeling of love is and its not us
have you met someone else
all those late night walks
i was attracted to another woman but it was the whole deal meeting gertrude stein and hemingway and dali and scott and zelda honey you better listen to yourself
youre a psycho
you dont know what youre doing
you see everything here through magical colored glasses
youre a california film writer with a house in beverly hills with two mercedes
youre not some kind of twenties expatriate novelist
her parents enter from the adjoining suite
whats going on
we can hear every word
if im not happy ill move back
but right now im going to stay
all your crazy hallucinatory friends
mother was right about you theres a part missing
said that first
anyone whos protagonist makes a living selling old cap pistols and joan crawford cut out books
youre better off without me
walk the streets gush over the parisian light and the rooftops
i had a private detective follow him i knew he was up to no good
daddy you didnt
he saw him get into a car at midnight each night and he followed close behind
i dont know
the detective agency says the detective is missing
detective tisserant is in a period room with two stunned period occupants
they all speak french
a qui ai je lhonneur
je me suis perdu jai pas du tourner au bon endroit guardes
quon lui coupe la tete
gil walking at night
he sees someone approaching and realizes it is the girl from the flea market gabrielle
hey i know you the girl at the flea market
oh yes yes the cole porter one
what are you doing here
im returning from dinner with my girlfriends
i live near here
whats your name
gabrielle im gil i just moved to paris this week
oh im sure youll love it
can i walk along with you or can i buy you a coffee
oh god its starting to rain
i dont mind getting wet
paris is the most beautiful in the rain
oh what a thing to say
i couldnt agree more
i just thought about you the other day because my boss got in a whole album of cole porter songs
hey what are those bells
midnight right right pretty name
fade out as they walk off together in the rain
