general catburd and other vips happy to observe on their tv monitors the sight of a man in black commando parachute suit carrying a battered old briefcase climbing into the
the jet car
the drivers pov a curious combination of airplane dials and switches and personal touches like a big four on the floor gear shift and a snazzy pearlized brodi knob with
snowflakes and a coochi coochi girl
angle on the driver as he removes a strange gryoscopic device from his briefcase plugs it into a cradle near his head
professor hikita standing at a special monitor as a light pops on indicating overthruster armed
he covers it with a hanky
all quiet suddenly the car poised waiting
general catburd grabbing some coffee and doughnuts
the secretary of defense peering out through a viewing slot
ive got a budget meeting on the hill john
whats this thing supposed to do anyway
three hundred miles an hour general
senator you are so fulla shit
the jet car undergoing an amazing transformation two stabilizer fins and a jet engine suddenly appearing on its rear deck
close on the driver to reveal buckaroo banzai world famous figure in every field of endeavor as he withdraws a beautiful kamikaze scarf from his flight suit
wraps it like a warriors headband around his helmet
angle on buckaroos hand as his fingers flip a row of toggle switches the pulsating power of the jet engine increasing dramatically with each successive switch
the vehicle a caged beast taunting us as buckaroo flips the last switch
final contact is made
a twenty foot sheet of fire rocketing from the back of the the cavaliers at their monitors calm
hikita making minor adjustments on his instrument bank
the secretary of defense and general catburd both now at viewing slots in the blockhouse wall
point of no return
five four three two
as buckaroo banzai twists his steering wheel mounted twin accelerators the sudden forward lurch of the jet car slamming him back against the headrest
technicians and vips eye their monitors
and so do we the rugged jet car raising a cloud of dust viewed from high above us it blasts ahead
too bad war aint indianapolis

perhaps an idea whose time has come general
catburd moving aside as senator cunningham takes her turn with the viewing device
itll never work
its too simple
high overhead manned by a tv news crew
an over the cameramans shoulder pov as the jet cars exhaust trail buckaroos pov as the highway races underneath him

perfect tommy slapping his hand on the desk
now twenty seconds downrange
perfect tommy how on earth is buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground
shes just a damn road hugger allison
plus the man can drive

the jet car screams past a bank of high approaching thirty seconds downrange three zero
speed three one seven nautical four hundred
hes gonna do it
the man is gonna do it
anybody can drive fast in a straight line
as if in response to catburds comment buckaroo does an amazing thing now flicking his directional signal
a fire breaking out on a dashboard gauge buckaroo quickly snuffing the sparks with his gloved hand
danger lights flashing
as awesome physical pressures take their tool on car and driver
buckaroo do you read
advise you abort
repeat advise abort
thats a big no can do
buckaroos voice through static and crackle
professor hikita white knuckled
buckaroo still accelerating struggling with his mighty machine
fierce vibrations oil and smoke filling the cockpit
as he wipes hot oil off his goggles
in the network helicopter a newsman and camerman catch this shocking turn of events their pov of
the jet car flaming along across the desert
a sonic a tv monitor
a helicopter shot revealing that the course thus far traveled by buckaroo is on fire the ground literally set ablaze by the incredible speed of his jet car the jet
car off the road
radio contact with mission control here severed
that firestorm apparently interfering with communications
buckaroo banzai in serious trouble
either that or hes popped his cookies
professor hikita on pins and needles face taught concerned
do you read
commence braking procedure
hes heading for the goddamn mountains
buckaroo heard faintly in a storm of noise
professor hikita whatd he say
quizzical he said this buds for you professor
what does that mean
on the monitors the jet car is seen heading directly into a box canyon and toward a wall of mountains impact virtually assured
looks like banzais finally gonna get more than he bargained for
and take the friends of the earth with him
rawhide and reno exchanging very concerned glances
buckaroo banzai peers out his thick glass window
angle on buckaroos hand moving to a switch on the dash marked oscillation overthurster remaining there posed
reverse on buckaroo eyes on his instruments
another angle on buckaroo hitting the overthruster
all instruments lose contact with the jet car
jaws drop in disbelief
its off my scope
what the devil
what is going on
buckaroos cockpit pov
like a roller coaster ride through a meteor shower the eighth dimension an organic asteroid hurtling right at us reverse angle
looking directly at buckaroo as his face distorts under god knows how many g forces
where the hell is he
his plexiglas visor shattering as if hit with a two by four
buckaroos windshield crackling and the cockpit turning close on dashboard wildly spinning dials buckaroo punching the oscillation overthruster again amid fire and smoke
the tv crew in their fancy helicopter first to witness an astounding sight
their pov the jet car emerging from solid rock as though the craggy in apoplexy hes through it
hes gone through the mountain without a scratch
oh my god
oh my god in heaven
an overjoyed professor hikita surrounded by chaos and confusion throws both arms skyward in triumph
fifty miles downrange buckaroo tries to slow the speeding smoke filled jet car
a parachute popping out its back at once ripping off in the high velocity wind
im gonna try and lay her sideways
another angle as he reaches for the hand brake and simultaneously spins his brodi knob hard to the right
buckaroo doing the impossible somehow bringing the racing jet car to a spinning skidding halt in a thicket of dry brush
as overhead that the battered jet car exhausting smoke buckaroo rolling its window down opening the door and emerging checking the damage to his vehicle noting a strange gelatinous substance
on the cracked windshield touching it and turning his nose from the smell
his glove steaming
angle on buckaroo as he lowers himself under the jet car coming face to face with one ugly spherical parasite the thing suddenly shooting out at buckaroo as hes about
to touch it
a mobile phone starting to beep back in the cockpit
the parasite coming to rest on the ground
pandemonium people cheering
general catburd on the phone
this his frequency
buckaroo ignoring the phone taking his lunch bag from the front seat and removing a sandwich taking a bite of it and using the foil to pick up the bizarre
parasite from the desert floor
wrapping the weird thing up
now at last reaching for the car phone
taking the phone gimme that
you tell me buckaroo what in the hell is this going through solid matter and rendering all conventional defense perimeters useless over night bullshit
but now professor hikita snatching the phone from the secretary turning his back to the room
did you seem them
buckaroo leaning in to check his gauges talking on his telephone
two figures from the news copter approaching still a hundred yards off
they about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast
broke my windshield
into phone the creatures
they attacked you
they tried to possess you
grabbing the phone buckaroo catburd here
i got egg all over my face but thats okay
no room for egos here

i wasnt talking to you hikita san
as the secretary of defense picks up a red phone
thisll be the president of me
perfect tommy and reno suddenly stepping forward intimidating catburd
shes not for sale right general
close on the haunting unsettling eyes of doctor lizardo an orange haired old man watching network footage of the jet car test on his battered philco tv set
his eyes practically burning a whole through the screen
pulling back to reveal a room in an insane asylum a room designed for several inmates but occupied by only one this crazy old fiend
the empty beds piled with books and italian memorabilia the walls covered with mathematical equations
angle on dr
lizardo even now unable to resist scribbling another formula on the wall with a piece of chalk
here she is slowed down
right into the side of that mountain
perfect tommy rawhide reno you guysre the hong kong cavaliers
buckaroos most trusted inner circle
so i gotta ask did it surprise you fellas as much as the rest of us when the bjv the experimental jet vehicle went right off the scope and apparently
smack into a black void
was buckaroo acting different this morning i mean in terms of other mornings
the cavaliers rolling their eyes looking at one another
well we partied pretty late last night
back to dr
lizardo now hearing footsteps outside in the corridor and hes just written
as his right hand reaches under his pillow and picks up a crude homemade electromagnet
a piece of metal wrapped in copper wire one end of which is a small loop that lizardo now attaches directly to his thumbs
muttering the overthruster
lizardo looking back at his equation at first puzzled to find it erased then becoming angry
obsessed the overthruster
forty six years prior years before the ill fated primitive speed car run involving buckaroos parents an unlikely experiment in a strange factory
a much younger dark haired doctor lizardo being strapped into a homemade wicker chair rocket sled by two lab assistants the entire contraption set up like a catapult aimed another
and peering into an unusual periscope an equally juvenile professor hikita wearing glasses and scraggly goatee
standing in front of a calendar on the wall todays eagerly awaited date circled in red
almost ready dr
doctor lizardo pulling on a leather helmet professor hikita nodding grimly at the lab assistants who tug on a giant lever
not so fast
angle on doctor lizardo pulling a switch unleashing his wicker chair at a fantastic speed down the rails
at the end of the track
the strange device coming to an abrupt and total stop ten feet from the brick wall pitching lizardo forward and
through the wall at least partially the seemingly solid bricks turning out to be more like vertical quicksand
lizardo half in half out physically unhurt but screaming his head off
the assistants rushing down the runway to help pry him loose while professor hikita observes an astonishing thing through his periscope
the doctors assistants frantically tugging on his feet dragging him back into the room only to find this suddenly orange haired lizardo a fearsome changed individual
close on lizardo
a terrifying scream issues from his mouth as he straightens up at last wrenching free of the wicker chair smashing his two assistants heads together as he jumps over the
hikita watching wild eyed as lizardo makes a mad dash into the vast shadowy expanse of the factory
a distant view of lizardo as he rips a door off its hinges escaping into the night silhoutted against a dazzling security light the nearly half a century later the
elderly lizardo regards with smoldering evil the turn of the key in his own door and the appearance of a guard who comes in and unplugs his tv set
cheer up lizardo its friday
i come for your tv
you been using too damn much juice
ten thousand kilowatts again this month
beats me how one old homicidal loony could use that much power
the guard leaving with lizardos tv
lizardo trying to control himself his eyes rolling up at the ceiling where yet another unusual equation has been scrawled in an angry hand
i want my tv
dont take my tv
i want it
i want the overthruster
i want it
mysterious half light
plugs and jacks
a portion of an upright base
drums with the banzai logo writ large
hands and feet putting everything together as an unseen audience stirs restlessly
backstage in a small dressing room the rock band known as the hong kong cavaliers waits to go on
three unidentified groupies in attendance as rawhide naps and reno tunes his saxophone while perfect tommy answers the questions of a female reporter from the local underground press
professor hikita meantime at a corner table studying his big notebook examining a pair of kodak slides
as there is the sound of a commotion in the corridor excited voices and foot traffic coming this way rawhide methodically counting down under his stetson five
the door to the dressing room opening precisely on the count of one admitting an out of breath and hastily tuxedoed buckaroo banzai a small crowd of assorted femal fans
got a half a tuna sandwich
same one you had yesterday
rawhide taking a half eaten sandwich out of his hat and tossing it to buckaroo
taking a big bite check in with the institute reno see if everythings kosher
buckaroo ive done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the jet car drive shaft
and theres a two hundred dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield
anybody seen my scope
coming right up buckaroo
perfect tommy producing a highly sophisticated slide viewer
buckaroo slipping in a transparency
his pov of a colorful prismatic graph over the backdrop of a naked buckaroo immediately diagnosing the problem and removing the naked woman slide from the viewer
anybody we know
who put this dirty picture in buckaroos viewer
rawhide reclaiming his raunchy slide buckaroo looking back into the sleek device
i ran it through the centrifuge but i came up blank
its definitely dead now although it still conducts electricity even better than copper does
super performance organic material
yes perfect tommy in a way
slipping in another slide notice
although certain components resist identification it corresponds very closely to an ordinary praying mantis
scrutinizing too closely
gotta be more than sheer coincidence
rawhide youre keen on bugs
what do you think
rawhide takes a look as reno hangs the phone up
everythings copacetic at the institute buckaroo
sams with the jet car and shes under lock and key
hes retiming her valves
buckaroo nodding as hes interrupted by perfect tommy whos now brought over the female reporter
buckaroo you got a minute
this is pretty important
she wants a picture
perfect tommy quickly taking a place beside buckaroo smiling into the camera as reno and rawhide exchange disgusted looks
the shutter clicking
another commotion in the hallway
the dressing room door opening to admit the club owner artie duncan a fifty year old rocker who has to struggle to close the door behind him on a herd
of reporters and fans
i dont care who you are
when you play my joint youre just another band
i want some music outta you characters
you want it artie
you got it
how do we look
do we look okay
i look great
lets rock n roll
a pair of no nonsense blue shield irregulars appearing to escort them on stage
as rawhide returns the spectroscope to professor hikita
no question about it
something very akin to arachnoid tissue
if i hadda guess
a mutated species
buckaroo the hong kong cavaliers and their two blue shield escorts hustling down a corridor
our boys arriving on stage
shadowy forms in the dramatically murky light
a familiar voice booming over the p
ladies and gentlemen arties artery is proud to present for one night only
the one the only the amazing buckaroo banzai and his hong kong cavaliers
on the audience buckaroo on lead guitar joining the hong kong cavaliers in a number so primal your feet just wont sit still
while at the rear of the room seated by herself we find an attractive young lady
crying for some reason exempt from the general raucous good will
she pours herself another drink but booze wont do the job
shes all alone
she needs some help
her name is penny on stage buckaroo banzai suddenly stops moving stops singing and waves the cavaliers to cease as well
eerie stillness the only sound buckaroos lips on the silver mike
i heard somebody crying
no response i said is someone out there crying in the darkness
pennys voice weakly here
here at the back
buckaroo squints spots her
his voice comes mighty over the public raise your hand
raising her hand this is so embarrassing
somebody get her a mike
can we manage that
and a spotlight
whats your name
id rather not reveal my last name or my age
for reasons out of their control pennys name coming across to buckaroo and the cavaliers as peggy said name immediately eliciting a surprised reaction from the cavaliers
buckaroo amazed as well
a not too distant pain deep in his soul momentarily manifesting itself although he makes a brave attempt at nonchalance
as now penny is given that microphone
did you say
my name is penny
there ive said it but it wont mean anything to you
im a nobody
the business of the names settled buckaroo and the cavaliers breathing a bit more easily
nobodys a nobody
whyre you crying
blowing her nose did i say anything was wrong
i just sponged up a little too much vat okay
im down to my last nickel in this lousy town i cant get my luggage outta hock cause i met this jerk who said he was a record producer when
all he had was a record
he offered to set me up for life and like a fool well i
he offered you money

to tell the truth i lost my room this morning
i dont know where im gonna sleep tonight but i keep going
what the hell else can i do
ive still got my figure and like this bozo said as long as theres a sidewalk ill always have a job
a few snickers
buckaroo shooting a disapproving look at those guilty of laughing at another persons misfortune
remember its always darkest just before the dawn
believe me ive been there
buckaroo moving to a piano
starting to play
this songs for peggy
and all you others out there a little down on your luck
exasperated my names penny
but who cares
buckaroo and his men start to sing another tune
and penny opens her big clear plastic purse removes first a dog earned paperback entitled beyond the realm of atomic particles and massless photons by buckaroo banzai
then a buckaroo banzai comic book its cover depicting buckaroo locked in mortal combat with hanoi shan the manchu terror
penny lays both publications on the table continues to dig around revealing next a shiny small caliber automatic on stage
as buckaroo pours it on looking in her direction
penny takes the gun from her purse and lays it in her lap tears starting to flood her eyes
buckaroo crooning all the women enraptured by his voice his sultry glance his animal presence
a real heart breaker
penny takes another drink wraps her hand around the tiny pearl handle
slowly moving the gun
on stage buckaroo startled
as in the blink of an eye penny attempts to shoot herself her arm accidentally deflected by a passing waitress the shot going harmlessly into the ceiling as
the crack hong kong cavaliers whip out their guns snapping back hammers forming a human barricade around buckaroo
while blue shield security men materialize and drag penny screaming from the room
let me go let me go you creeps
everybody okay up here
arrest the girl
lets get this thing on the road huh
the cavaliers holstering their weapons resuming musical postures
but his mind still half on penny priddy
several madmen playing video games content
doctor lizardos philco tv now sitting on a watch desk the guard who took it eating dinner leaning back in his chair his feet on the set
so he can bash it now and then to improve the picture quality
as a shadow falls across him
pulling a ratty suitcase on tiny travel wheels wearing an ancient sportjacket
out for a stroll
where do you think youre going doc
an amazing thing occurring as lizardos right arm rockets out an catches the astonished guard around the throat lifting him off the floor lizardos left hand picking up the telephone
i wanna place a person to person call to john bigboote yoyodyne propulsions systems
grovers mill new jersey
tell him its john whorfin calling
thats w h o r f i n

j o h lizardo waiting for the call to go through as he strangles the last breath of air out of the helpless guard drops him to the linoleum reaching
for the dead mans keys
into phone of course its me john bigboote you fool
prepare for my return
the time has come
havent you heard
dont you watch tv
banzai and hikita have done it
ill meet you at the factory
get that overthruster
and the little jap
banzais too dangerous
lizardo ripping the phone out of the wall hurling it across the room
those inmates playing their video games fleeing like rabbits when they see that
lizardo obviously no ordinary lunatic as he proves by simply reaching out and
touching the buckaroo banzai video game instantly shorting it out on his way to freedom suitcase in tow
close on a newspaper a banner front page headline announcing the amazing jet car test
and down in a lower corner a photograph of would be assassin penny priddy being summarily escorted out of arties artery
pulling a simple steel frame bed fold out desk with microscope scientific books everywhere
buckaroo trying to tie his bowtie glancing at the newspaper propped upon his dresser that picture of penny priddy staring back at him
perfect tommy and reno nearby assembling some kind of slide show
the whole room swaying mysteriously
the two cavaliers worrying more about buckaroo than about what theyre doing as they fumble the slides several falling to the floor
pick those up reno
i didnt drop em
perfect tommy getting up and peeking at the newspaper over buckaroos shoulder
then returning to reno
their voices low
its a spittin image
doesnt look anything like her to me
pictures dont lie
hell they dont
i met my first wife that way
its peggy to these eyes
same nose same hair
plus buckaroo thinks so too or else he wouldnt be ready to go make a fool of himself right
buckaroo overhearing all of this of course as the door opens rawhide appearing offering a computer print out
hot off the world watch wire buckaroo
thought youd wanna be notified
that old pal of the professors dr
the one you did the brain scan on
he killed a guard last night broke outta the trenton home for the criminally insane stole a masarati totaled it a block away
buckaroos expression changing at the mention of the name lizardo
taking the print out
wasnt he on tv once
youre thinking of mr
this guys an eccentric genius
hey so was mr
lizardos a raving lunatic perfect tommy a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours
have you warned professor hikita
first thing i did
in the dark why
whats going on
anything i oughta know
cmon rawhide spill it
buckaroo nodding his permission
the professor and dr
emilio lizardo were actually the first to discover the eighth dimension
almost fifty years ago
before buckaroos parents even knew each other
but there was trouble a rocket catapult failed and dr
lizardo got sucked half in half out
when they hauled him back he wasnt the same guy
his hair was orange
and his soul black as the ace of spades
he went on a senseless crime spree killed a cop during a bank robbery got caught and judged insane
the professor told us they threw away the key
hey any lock can be picked
so whats he up to
im sure well find out soon enough
buckaroo heading for the door
rawhide drawing a receipt book from his pocket
and another thing
somebody took five bucks outta petty cash without signing
buckaroo and reno automatically turning to perfect tommy
id take a hundred right
the guys following buckaroo into an amazing electronic nerve center like the rugged interior of an awacs dimly lighted instrument panels manned by two blue shield technical experts
lookit this buckaroo
grossly abnormal high altitude electrostatic disturbance over connecticut
fallout from the jet car you think
check norad command
could be a volcanic ash cloud
work her up statistically check it for the next twenty four hours then shovel the data over to reno
buckaroo coming through another heavy steel door and for the first time we realize that we just might be on a moving bus
buckaroos bus pulling up
buckaroo banzai and the hong kong cavaliers emblazoned along its side
waiting near the watch desk buckaroos jewish surgeon buddy dr
in a thousand dollars worth of drugstore cowboy gear a hoppalong cassidy hat red alligator boots listening to the local country station on a suitcase size stereo

reno picking up doctor zwibels huge stereo and suitcase
follow me pardner
penny sitting on her bunk a disheveled mess
depressed her head buried in her hands as buckaroo arrives
she sees his reflection in the pitiful mirror above her toilet
whatre you doing here
whyre you looking at me like that
i guess cause you remind me of someone i once knew long ago before any of this craziness
let me rot
who were you really trying to kill last night

penny realizing you dont fool this man with the sloppy bowtie
coming over to the bars

penny taking too long to retie buckaroos tie
an excuse to be near him

things really heating up between these two
buckaroo changing the subject
blocking perfect tommys view

buckaroo touching her moist cheek wiping away a tear
perfect tommy and the desk sergeant exchanging looks
running a little late buckaroo
let her out
in my custody
let her out
shes a killer
buckaroo and penny unable to look away from each other
no shes not
reporters cameras microphones and a small audience of vips civilian and military in a large hotel conference room
eyes on the ticking clock
examining charts and models of subatomic particles
on the dais professor hikita secretary of defense mckinley and senator cunningham waiting for buckaroo
over the refreshment table set up for reporters two redheaded men wearing glasses practically fill their cups with cubes of sugar
one of their arms elongating for more sugar
the strange move as the crowd breaks into spontaneous applause and buckaroo banzai enter penny priddy beside him
the glamorous couple surrounded by the hong kong cavaliers
john oconnor and john gomez those two nearsighted redheads with the sweet coffee applauding only politely
buckaroo taking penny onto the dais with him the cavaliers assuming positions of security as
buckaroo sits next to professor hikita who shields his remarks from what must be easily fifty microphones
rawhide tells me dr
nodding im assigning a couple blue shields to protect you around the clock just in case
professor hikita removing the oscillation overthruster from his battered briefcase and laying it on the table
buckaroo taking a sip of water
thank you for coming
before i answer any questions i think buckaroo owes us all a few explanations for yesterdays antics
senator cunningham ladies and gentlemen
thirty years ago nearly to this day my mother and father and sir alan motley all former colleagues of professor toichi hikita at the texas school of mines gave their
lives for what was considered at the time an insane notion the possibility of contacting alien life
not on another planet but on a simultaneous plane of existence within solid matter
life which before the war professor hikita had actually glimpsed while pioneering a highly primitive gravity catapult with doctor emilio lizardo
st reporter the same doctor lizardo that just
one and the same
john oconnor and john gomez at the refreshment table now adding several packs of sweet n low to their thick coffee as
i dont wanna go get too technical here ladies and gentlemen but im talking twister physics
now you see now you dont
this table im sitting behind
it appears to be solid matter right
buckaroo demonstrating by picking up his plastic water glass dropping it splashing water left and right as the container naturally bounces off the table
but in point of fact the solid parts of this table
the protons quarks your neutrons and electrons
they comprise only about one quadrillionth of its total volume
which is not a helluva lot to sink your teeth into
so the professor here way back in figured that if solid matter is mostly empty space a person oughta be able to discover a to travel inside things like tables
we at the banzai institute have at last found that way an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces
which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part right professor
nd reporter what about the pentagon
the possibility of war in the eighth dimension mr
hey better there than here huh
some applause the secretary of defense eyeing penny critically as the lights dim
as radar shield one slips into the room approaches the dais and the first slide is projected onto the screen
the image a murky one
but the outline of a warship with u
sailors aboard nonetheless unmistakable
a whisper the presidents calling you buckaroo
the president of what
the president of the united states
another slide even more graphic the number on the bow of the ship plainly visible
is he still delirious
shrugging cant tell
its real fuzzy
i patched him through to a pay phone down the hall
in a u
navy frigate number disappeared on a clear day in the north atlantic
long thought to have been torpedoed these pictures of were taken yesterday in the eighth dimension
now wait a minute here
next transparency please
a loud murmur from the audience as the next slide in the projector proves to be a remarkable image
of an upside down seventeenth century pirate vessel
buckaroo starting from the table only to be reminded by penny buckaroo dont forget your thruster
handing him the oscillation overthruster
buckaroo declining it
you keep an eye on it
meanwhile several thousand miles overhead a huge spikey spacecraft a mysterious cloud room where black brroding creatures perch upside down and sideways at controls in a smoky vaporous environment the
only illumination eerie yellow light
the walls breathing
back at a pay phone in the corridor buckaroo trying to figure out why the president doesnt answer
seemed like a bad connection even back on the bus
but they used the code
some kind of interference
nothing from the other end except odd sounding computer beeps and the static laden voices of several operators
maybe its just a prankster
some computer whiz kid
whoever it was they used the blue code alpha clearance
to radar shield one go back to the bus and reroute the call
and try the presidents private number at the hospital
make sure this is on the level
were busy people here
when suddenly eerie inexplicable things begin to occur
all having to do with electricity
the telephone book scooting closer to buckaroos fingers as if drawn by a magnet the pages then turning faster and faster
now the glass phone booth door abruptly slamming shut the phone simultaneously emitting a bizarre buzz
and then buckaroo gets literally the shock of his life
a mighty pencil
reno complying the lights returning to normal buckaroo dazed his hand moving automatically writing on any surface available
a spark flying when he touches the metal tipped pen to metal
buckaroo finally settling for his hand scribbling numbers on his palm
let me ask you to imagine the oscillation overthruster as a sophisticated rifle accelerator firing a steady stream of protons at a target in this case a mountain and the
jet car as a giant super conducting magnet
the secretary of defense fascinated
sure sure but what about the fourth fifth sixth and seventh dimensions
thumbing through her paperback i dont guess they matter
its like cheesecloth i think
as all eyes turn to see a still woozy buckaroo banzai returning pointing dramatically at john gomez and john oconnor in the audience
the cavaliers havent a clue what hes talking about
whadda you mean buckaroo
pure and simple from the eighth dimension
nothing out of the ordinary
neither reno nor anyone else in the room seeing what buckaroo does seeing instead only those two redheaded gents who like their coffee sweet john oconnor and john gomez
could they possibly be the crimson creatures buckaroo thinks arachtoids
buckaroo breaking into a dead run across the room those two astonished red aliens racing for the nearest exit
the hong kong cavaliers rushing to help buckaroo when suddenly the piercing scream of penny priddy causes them to stop in their tracks and look toward the dais
where yet nother redhead called john bigboote in glasses and dark suit a bandanna over his face has just stepped from behind the curtain and seized professor hikita pointing a
revolver at the old mans head
the cavaliers instinctively stepping toward the dais outraged
okay wise guys
the masked john bigboote firing once wounding reno in the shoulder
let those gun belts hit the floor
and nobody follows or the prof is history
the pistol stuck in professor hikitas ear convincing the cavaliers to obey to watch helplessly as the kidnapper backs his victim through the curtain and out of sight
as new jersey administers first aid to reno and penny strokes the fallen cavaliers hair berating the idle bystanders around them is this the kind of society you want
a society of weak kneed jellyfish wallowing in self pity prey to ruthless hoodlums who pick us off like flies
or a society where we stand strong take charge of our own destiny with the cry so far and no farther will we be pushed
buckaroo in the meantime running down a flight of stairs
catching sight of his prey
those two monstrous red aliens running through a swinging door
buckaroo accelerating hitting the door with every ounce of strength in him
buckaroo flying through the door taking a fall down concrete steps finding himself in the hotel parking garage where a motorcycle show is unloading equipment
buckaroo spotting three shadowy forms halfway across the lot loading a large crate into a van
buckaroo wasting no time going after the van as it starts up
commandeering a fancy new motorcycle charging after the van despite an exhibitors warning hey you cant ride that
the cavaliers coming from two directions colliding at an intersection
any sign of buckaroo
ditto the professor shit
the van speeds by
the motorcycle pursues
the chase continues leaving the city behind
the van coming straight toward us thundering past
as buckaroo and his motorcycle next roar into camera in hot pursuit and over his shoulder an awesome sight
twilight enveloping a new jersey meadow as a pair of duck hunters and their dog takes advantage of the last half hour of fading daylight as
that black creature wings overhead
the duck hunters confused frightened firing as a reflex reaction to this sudden threat from above
close on the awful black creature hit swooping low with a horrible shudder
the hunters transfixed
what the hell
the frightful sound of the creatures failing lungs
a terrific noise as the duck hunters hurry to where their unnatural kill hangs obscured in a gigantic tree
their dog running ahead intent on retrieving this unusual bird
the heavy footed hunters sloshing through water the first hunter to arrive on the scene using a sharp stick to poke at a bulging bladder on the bottom of the
strange creature the sac bursting and drenching the hunter with a hideous viscous fluid
and a strange blue as suddenly an enormous sphere drops out of the tree and begins rolling toward the hunter who poked that sac
what is it
the other hunter following the odd spere as it backs his buddy into a shallow swamp
the thing coming to a stop and
a black man with dreadlocks emerging from the top of the weird vessel trying to balance himself when he slips and crashes to the ground his neck breaking
a beam from his dropped flashlight revealing him in death to be not a black man but a black alien with a the hunters terrified as their dog starts snarling
at the tree where now a second black man has emerged running for the road jumping the fence like a gazelle
the hunters not seeing this second individual obsessed instead with a buckaroo banzai comic book theyve discovered in the dead aliens fingers
its the latest issue
buckaroo still on his motorcycle in pursuit of the van taking a daring shortcut down a treacherous hillside
alien john bigboote at the wheel alien john gomez riding shotgun in high spirits cradling a dry cell battery his strange tongue upon it getting high
his teeth glowing
bigboote turning in his seat overhearing alien john oconnor operating a radio in the rear of the speeding van
a black ship
listening a black thermopods been shot down ten miles back
a black thermopod here
why john gomez
john bigboote looking at john gomez for any possible explanation
maybe they know hes escaped
how could they possibly know
theyre more than three trillion six hundred sixty million miles away
jerking the wheel they know everything
i told whorfin to sit tight
this could be the end of us all
we gotta get banzais overthruster and get off this rock
the van making a turn
john bigboote yelling back to john oconnor where was it john oconnor
how far back
i have a radio fix
john gomez opening the glove compartment taking out a pistol death to the enemy
death to the enemy
kill or die
john bigboote just driving
his strange eyes set
buckaroo rounding a curve on his motorcycle when that van is suddenly upon him coming head on
buckaroo just having a split second to catch the logo yoyodyne on the front of the van as he swerves into a ditch to avoid certain death
buckaroo quickly restarting the motorcycle and taking out a swiss army lighter miniature two way radio making a call to rawhide
back in the press conference room the anxious cavaliers try to help several law enforcement types reconstruct the professors kidnapping
a tiny buzzer going off in rawhides pocket his swiss army cigarette lighter
rawhide turns his back on everyone taking out a pack of luckies lighting up as he talks quietly into the flame over buckaroo
where in hades are you
im getting a lotta static
buckaroo pushing and shoving his motorcycle onto a woodland path
it thats me
ive been ionized but im okay
im switching on the homing beacon mark two minute intervals
buckaroo somebody shanghaied the professor
the deuce you say
realizing that crate
elsewhere in the room nervous and concerned penny priddy sits apart from the others thumping the keys of a piano
i think im on to something
you and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called yoyodyne
into flame yoyodyne propulsion systems
you think theyre mixed up in this
reno sitting down next to penny at the piano his wounded arm in a sling but his fingers nimble as ever
how long you been riding with buckaroo reno
nigh on ten years
been through a lotta scrapes together
whatd you do before
can i ask
had my own think tank
got tired of thinking wanted some action
seen plenty of it too
so will you if you stick around
is he alive
course hes alive
hes buckaroo banzai
rawhide calling from across the room
we got our work cut out for us tonight
reno getting up penny unsure at that moment whether shes being included as those steely eyes of rawhide zero in on her
you too miss penny
darkness as buckaroo races on the taillights of the van far ahead
john gomez now sharing his dry cell battery with john oconnor the two of them singing a song from their home planet
john bigboote at the wheel preoccupied refusing their offer of a toke on the battery with no thanks im driving
the yoyodyne van approaching the scene of the downed spacecraft the headlights of the single highway patrol car illuminating the corpse of the dead creature in the water
the highway patrolman pulling the figure out of the water the hunters standing by
hand me that tarp
lets cover this guy
hes got paws
the other hunter tossing a plastic tarp over the body as they all turn to regard the headlights of the yoyodyne van
the cop heading that way
buckaroo arriving now too scraping to a stop on his motorcycle in heavy brush creeping closer to the crash site for a better look
buckaroos pov the ungainly spherical spacecraft and that amazing dead creature on the ground covered now with a sheet of semi transparent plastic
observing john bigboote and john gomez producing official i
s and appearing to buckaroo as crimson aliens
to the cops as
john bigboote officer
executive vice president yoyodyne propulsion systems
of the spacecraft one of our birds
the highway patrolman returning bigbootes i
still a little skeptical about the whole thing pointing to the dead creature under that fella over there that one of yours too is it
john bigboote having a ready answer
the droid you mean
buckaroo moving quickly to the back of the van starting to open the rear door with a locksmiths pick attached to his special swiss army buckaroo dropping the two way
radio homing device on the bumper
the sound of the swiss army lighter jolting red alien john oconnor
oconnor thinking the noise has come from the crate itself
button up in there professor if you know whats good for you
john oconnor stepping out for a smoke
buckaroo watching the alien john oconnor move off in the direction of the hunters retrieving his dropped swiss army lighter not noticing that the once blinking l
on the homing device has gone out
buckaroo again picking the lock
ordinary citizen john oconnor meanwhile observing the hunters still hanging around one of them engrossed in the buckaroo comic his pal trying to figure out how to operate the dead
aliens unusual flashlight
nice night huh
as buckaroo stealthily enters working the lock on the crate now with his all purpose lighter
john bigboote john gomez and the cop looming above the dead creature
looks like nothing i ever seen
i seen droids in space movies but theyre nothing like this its a three man thermopod
john bigboote shooting john gomez a hard stare
top secret right john gomez
yeah well i was gonna call buckaroo banzai out here to have a look
right up his alley i think
john bigbootes mood suddenly changing
you called buckaroo banzai
i said i was gonna
the three of them looking up at another pair of headlights arriving a sedan the cop yelling at them go on
keep it moving
we got a truck on the way to mop things up for you
else this place could become a zoo not to mention a haven for gawkers
the highway patrolman moving off to deal with the sedan
well just go ahead and start breaking it down
dont touch it
i got my own help on the way
thats an order
john bigboote frowning telling john gomez theres a crowbar in the truck
john gomez nodding heading back to the van
as buckaroo pries his way into the crate extracting the shaken professor hikita
a spark dancing between them as they touch
what the sam hill
dont make noise and dont touch me
im hotter than flapjacks
im a giant semi conductor and theres alien creatures all around us
form the eighth dimension i think
buckaroo trying to show professor hikita the mathematical formula written on his hand
you can see them
buckaroo holding a finger to his lips
ever since that phony phone call from the president
look at this
what is it
its your hand buckaroo
its an antidote
whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises
buckaroo opening the door to the van
buckaroo sees the red alien john gomez coming closer
antidote to what
from planet ten
pointing quickly theres a harley behind those bushes
get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula
we dont have time to ask questions
just synthesize it the professor still without the crucial information however
john gomez approaching
buckaroo the formula thinking fast buckaroo presses the palm of his hand to professor hikitas forehead the ball point ink transferring
the important hurry
the highway patrolman talking to the sedan
two shadowy figures if youre gonna stay youre gonna be under arrest
its your choice
meanwhile back on buckaroos bus in the nerve center rawhide and perfect tommy look at a blank oscilloscope operated by a blue shield technician
twelve minutes since the last signal
we better get somebody over there
put up the grid last known location close on oscilloscope
an electronic grid field coming up noting buckaroos last location
hop on the marconi see if we got any blue shields within a ten minute radius
buckaroo moving dangerously closer to the thermopod as the alien john gomez returns with the crowbar
his other worldly comrade demanding open it
the highway patrolman meanwhile at his squad car on his radio
the inside an all night gas station somewhere in new jersey a young black kid named scooter lindley at his special ham radio set hearing repeat intrastate outward band
calling all blue shield irregulars in the clam state
bucakroo in trouble
will repeat coordinates
this is scooter lindley future knight of the blue shield
scooter racing outside toward his father casper lindley the station owner an everyday no nonsense guy in grungy overalls presently trying to sell a crushed velvet sofa from the top
of a three tier display rack to a pair of discriminating customers
buckaroos in trouble
a weary worried rawhide comes back into the front of the bus and takes a seat near penny and reno
nah damn sophisticated equipment always breaking down
reno wondering if theres more to it than rawhides saying
rawhide losing himself in a copy of american horseman
penny leaning forward thinking picking at a guitar left on the seat in front of her watching the mysterious hong kong cavaliers
perfect tommy arriving whispering something in rawhides ear rawhide nodding
penny looking over at perfect tommy across the aisle perfect tommy confiscating the guitar
whats his problem
perfect tommys just threatened by smart women
can you play that thing
better than him
buckaroo jockeying for an improved position as the alien john gomez prepares to strike the pod two men getting out of the sedan now
arachtoids in baggy suits
the crowbar hitting the pod for the first time
the cop turning shouting at john gomez from his squad car whadda you think youre doing
the cop in a jam heading back toward the pod as the two newly arrived redheads follow him despite his instructions i said back off
i mean it
now get in your car and get the hell outta here
the two goons halting
but as soon as the cop turns they follow him again
a modest estate several unique buildings on several acres of rolling midlothian grassland home of buckaroo banzai and the hong kong cavaliers
that famous double b logo festooning a large front gate
a sign the banzai institute for biomedical engineering and strategic a number of buckaroos devoted fans perpetually outside with sleeping bags and cameras
a wave of excitement rippling through the crowd as buckaroos double bus approaches and three blue shields on guard begin opening the gate
a combination japanese ryokan american ranch house an elegant reflection of buckaroos dual lineage
a teenage girl heading for the door to answer an insistent buzzer
penny and the hong kong cavaliers standing outside
johnson reacting as if shes seen a ghost
shes not peggy mrs
johnson not peggy
of course not
how could she be huh
any word from buckaroo
i thought he was with you guys
the cavaliers quickly dispersing
penny left alone under mrs
johnsons curious eyes
the cavaliers stepping into a home studio a tangle of wires and microphones mixing consoles and data banks tended by a skeleton crew of blue shield technicians
one a brainy wiry kid in his late teens
gonna lay down some background vocals tonight
wish life was so simple billy
remember that outfit the justice department checked into last year yoyodyne propulsion systems
the big space and weapons high tech consortium way behind on their delivery of the controversial new truncheon bomber
you got her
buckaroos orders access their data bank
attack their systems
up to it
im a little short handed tonight
my phone phreaks went into town for the big ice cream social
so well help
lets get crackin
buckaroo watches the alien john gomez deliver another blow to the black space pod as inside
sits a single black arachtoid crewman named john gant stoically at this communications console trying to focus on a distorted picture from deep space even as his enemy pounds and
cuts through the hull
the picture of his video console coming into focus a higher ranking destroy yourself john gant
the black arachtoid wing commander standing at his radio video console receiving a picture of john gant
my most profuse apologies to my homeland and loved ones
john valuk is dead
he fell on his head but perhaps john parker will get through
the screen going dark
the arachtoid wing commander exchanging words with his second in command
but what if john parker too is dead
then we must send another thermopod at once to contact buckaroo banzai
theres no time
we have our order from john emdall
the alien john oconnor looking in on the crate
finding it empty
ordinary citizen john gomez hitting the little thermopod again the cop exasperated pushed to the brink surrounded
thats it gentlemen youre all under
the cop reaches for his pistol when suddenly john bigboote whirls and lunges out with his telescoping arm chopping the cops adams apple knocking him to the ground
the hunters stunned one of them reaching for a shotgun when the two newly arrived yoyodyne goons attack easily knocking the hunters to the ground beating them
bucakroo starting forward but a three digit hand suddenly on his shoulder
spinning him around
easy friend buckaroo face to face with red arachtoid john oconnor the latter surprised to discover its
buckaroo taking advantage of this creatures momentary amazement to kick oconnor below the belt
dropping him to the turf
now spying yet another set of headlights coming down the road
in pain its buckaroo banzai
he let the professor outta the box
the goons pursuing buckaroo onto the road the headlights of a truck bearing down on them
buckaroo waving back at the truck his only chance when suddenly instead of slowing the truck speeds up trying to run him over
buckaroo lunging to safety at the last minute getting up and running into a field
the yoyodyne truck making a turn and coming after him across the meadow
buckaroo pursued by the truck and the goons when suddenly the black thermopod explodes buckaroo and the goons flying to the ground buckaroo quickly up and running the truck gaining
still gaining when out of nowhere a rope ladder falls from the sky entangling buckaroo and pulling him up to a hovering piloting the small chopper casper lindley gas station
proprietor along with his eager son scooter
both father and son dressed in blue shield outfits now
casper giving buckaroo a helping hand into the swift flying craft and getting a mild electrical shock coming this forgive the butterfingers buckaroo
casper lindley knight of the blue shield at your disposal
and my son scooter
nothing to apologize for casper
youve gone beyond the call of duty tonight
mind if i get on the horn and radio the cavaliers
theyll be worried
buckaroo reaching for the mike relieved to feel only a slight electrical charge on touching it
not the famous scooter
you know it
professor hikita on motorcycle being waved through the front gate by a blue shield guard while a second shield pinky carruthers on horseback telephones ahead
the prof just rolled in
says hes on his way to the lab and do not disturb
reno on the phone getting the word on hikita while the other cavaliers watch billy call up a strange senseless maze of letters and numbers on his monitor
try a new cipher
more like it
nice work kid
close up screen the letters having at least turned into something coherent
a batch of names and dates vital statistics
headed looks like weve accessed their read only memory
a personnel file
could be highly revealing
rejoining the group the professor just pulled in jabbering something about space monsters locked himself in his lab
johnson leading penny down a richly paneled corridor past pictures and momentoes of buckaroo and the cavaliers past and present
im sure the boys like you
they just dont wanna get attached
and then see what happened to buckaroos last sweetheart happen to you
what happened to her
johnson biting her tongue
you know any judo
dont worry i wont hurt you
penny staring at this strange young girl not knowing what to say
whats up those stairs
youll be bedding down in here
johnson opening a guest room door
penny eyeing those forbidden stairs
this is queer
billy staring intently at the monitor
the others leaning in
close on monitor a list of identical dates and places next to a raft all these people applied for drivers licenses in the same town in new jersey on the
exact same date
forty six yoyodyne employees
grovers mill new jersey
grovers mills grovers mills
whys that so darn familiar
looks like none of these guys ever lived anywhere else
no places of birth
and all of them with the same first name john
new jersey studying the screen
november thirty days have september april june and november
when short februarys done all the rest have thirty one
dont you get it
obviously not orson welles
you mean the guy from the old wine commercials
war of the worlds
that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared thinking that real live martians were landing in grovers mill new jersey
but then it all just turned out to be a hoax
then thats it
hoax my eye
right across the river in grovers mills
pinky carruthers aboard his palomino as john parker the only alien to escape the black thermopod rides up outside the gate on a bicycle
holding a strange yellow record in his grasp
hi buddy what can i do for ya
you a messenger
whatve you got here
pinky carruthers snatching the odd yellow record through the gate
i need see buckaroo banzai in person
my name is john parker
knight commander pinky carruthers
sorry john all these people need see buckaroo in person
and with that pinky carruthers is gone trotting up toward the mansion on his palomino
as a frustrated john parker suddenly sticks his nose in the air getting a whiff of something causing him to get on his bike and pedal
around the corner of buckaroos estate where he notices a parked van and three shadowy figures lowering themselves into the ground near the high security wall
john parker approaching beholding
that familiar yoyodyne van
and a freshly dug hole crawling into the hold himself
surfacing within the walls of the estate and again catching sight of the shadowy figures moving toward the buildings john parker following
quickly ducking behind a tree trying to get himself a good view of the three intruders
thats as far as you go pal
john parker jerking his head around finding himself confronting the frightening silhouette of a blue shield in camouflage commando gear
john parker instinctively raising a hand to protect himself when without warning a second blue shield drops on his head from the tree above knocking him down
sam the mechanic next to buckaroos precious jet car tinkering with that damaged harley davidson
the garage door suddenly sliding open startling sam
no one there
okay whos the funny guy
in the buses close on something weird emerging slowly from teh alien sam stepping forward
a five pronged organic stinger the size of a walnut flying out of the night
a scream dying in sams throat as he clutches his heart john bigboote dragging him back into the garage
while the red alien john gomez remains outside as a lookout the alien john oconnor quickly peering into the locked jet car and smashing the window searching in vain for
the oscillation not here
john whorfin will kill us
its not here
outside john gomez making a startling discovery the figure of professor hikita near an upstairs window of the research building only yards away
when suddenly overhead
casper lindleys chopper
landing behind a stand of trees as the alien intruders scatter for cover
johnson sitting near a crackling fire at a small desk stacked high with books and papers her nose in an advanced chemical engineering text
looking up as the front door opens admitting buckaroo banzai casper and scooter bringing up the rear
is the professor here
both of em safe and sound
whats going on
everybodys freakin out
a shaken rawhide reno perfect tommy appearing on the stairway
theyre arachtoids buckaroo from planet
how do you know that
its all on the record
come on buckaroo heading up the stairs
buckaroo moving quickly down the corridor with his men being debriefed on the run planet
the same planet you postulated beyond pluto perfect tommy
the invisible body
yeah but most of em blasted in through the eighth dimension in at grovers mills new jersey
where there was some kinda giant crash landing a huge explosion and they fooled orson welles into covering it up
and then they founded yoyodyne propulsion systems and hid there for
what about doctor lizardo
lizardo caused it all
because he was already here on earth screwing around with his own stupid overthruster
but he wasnt the real doctor lizardo
just this arachtoid creep that stole the good docs body the year before in the eighth dimension when prof
hikitas lab exploded
stole his body
when doctor lizardos hair turned red and his mind snapped
it wouldnt tell us the whole story until you got here
it wasnt to talk to the head honcho
professor hikita and his assistant toil away starting at
an elaborate electron tube apparatus that just now beings to produce the professor excited confused
rechecking buckaroos equation on his forehead by looking into a mirror
while billy places john parkers unusual yellow record on a turntable in buckaroos cluttered office
casper and scooter and the cavaliers seeking protection behind a plexiglas blackboard their faces seen through a maze of mathematical symbols and equations
buckaroo at his messy desk with a can of beer fascinated to see he stand back man
as the needle now comes down on the yellow disc and amid a flurry of smoke and sparks a gorgeous black human femal sizzles up from the grooves of the
record and hovers in mid air
salutations great buckaroo banzai
i am john emdall from planet
a common grave danger confronts both our worlds
meanwhile out in the corridor mrs
johnson advances with a load of cold beers and birdseye burritos
passing by a figure frozen in the shadows
our pov the alien john oconnor
johnson gone none the wiser
johnson entering dropping some of her load in shock at the sight of beautiful john emdall floating free in the center of the room
reno picking her things up as mrs
johnson backs away from the hologram and sticks the burritos in a portable microwave oven in the corner of buckaroos desk
after a bloody reign of terror the hated leader of our military caste the self proclaimed lord whorfin a bloodthirsty butcher as evil as your hitler was overthrown by freedom
loving forces tried and condemned along with several hundred of his followers to spend eternity in the formless void of the eighth dimension
death was deemed too good for their ilk
did you tell penny buckaroo wanted to see her
shes not in her room
will everybody please shut up so i can hear this thing
were it not for the experiments of your father and professor hikita and the real doctor lizardo then john whorfin would still be locked safely away on another plane of
rawhide and pinky carruthers holding a whispered conversation elsewhere in the room
john parker i think he called himself this rasta man on a bike dressed up in aluminum foil
with a weird album
how the hell was i supposed to know he came from outer space
buckaroo moving dangerously close to the hologram
john emdall suddenly pointing right at the great man
and now you buckaroo banzai have unintentionally helped john whorfin further with your oscillation overthruster
for our intelligence warns us that john whorfin is about to make good his escape from earth back through the eighth dimension
and on to planet
if he should attempt this we will have no choice but to disrupt worldwide electronic communications and fire a particle beam weapon from your airspace to smolensk in the union
of the soviet socialist republics
an action the kremlin will most certainly misinterpret as an american first strike
exactly perfect tommy
the soviets will retaliate
your president widmark will launch a massive counterforce strike
and within twenty minutes the danger to planet will be removed
god if its not one thing its another
because were good guys were giving you a chance to save your planet
stop john whorfin before sunrise
if you fail we will be forced to help you destroy yourselves
end of discussion
theres an awful pause
and then a screech as john emdall spirals downward into the grooves of the record again
she gotta be kiddin right
vaporize the whole damn planet
you wanna take the chance casper
rawhide go find out how professor hikitas coming with that formula
johnson take casper and scooter gas up the jet car
wow you know it
buckaroo heading for the door
wherere you goin
to get my guns
professor hikita and his assistant leaning over the electron tube apparatus removing a rubber stopper from one of the receptacles in the process getting an accidental whiff of that bizarre
glowing green compound
professor hikita and assistant letting out gasps seeing a sight that nearly stops their hearts
professor hikita petrified stepping back grabbing the oscillation overthruster and knocking over a chair as the alien creature smashes the window
rawhide hearing screams from the professors laboratory races down the corridor gun drawn
buckaroo coming into his bedroom opening a dresser drawer when suddenly
a noise behind him
buckaroo whirling instinctively with twin ebony handled colts a fraction of a second from firing
the latter poking her head out of buckaroos closet just long enough to see him aim his silver pistols jumping back into the closet slamming the door
an exasperated buckaroo stepping over to the closet finding it locked
open up or ill shoot it off
ill shoot yours off if i had a gun you double dealing casanova
i thought you liked me for myself
but why should you huh
a jerk like me
buckaroo understanding at last the reason for pennys odd behavior seeing the photograph on his bedstand of a younger possibly not yet so world famous buckaroo banzai in tuxedo
his pretty companion a dead penny look you look
who is she
thats kinda complicated to get into right now because the worlds maybe coming to an end and i cant stand here and talk to a closet door
yeah whose world is coming to an end
you only wanted me because i remind you of her
buckaroo fidgeting precious seconds ticking away
penny i was going to get into that but i havent had time
with arachtoids and all
but briefly she was your long lost twin sister we got married and thats about all i can say
no response penny
a silence from the other side the closet door unlocking
slowly opening revealing penny standing in the middle of a pile of female clothing
so thats it
buckaroo banzai a married man
where is she
with the kids some place
penny eyeing him penetrating his soul
she mustve been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you
she was killed penny
dont go to pieces
i havent got time tonight
a pregnant pause the pain evident on buckaroos face as he turns back to the job at hand picking up his holster and rummaging through the dresser drawer fighting back
the painful memories
looks like youre the one might go to pieces
wheres my damn ammo
nothing is ever where its supposed to be around here
how did she die
i wanna know
you dont wanna know
yes i do
gimme a chance
im stronger than you think
she was murdered by hanoi shan on our wedding night
the guy in your comic books
boss of the world crime league
supreme commander of the legion of death
the pivot of mystery himself
youre putting me on
hes a cartoon character
i wish he was
hes real enough
penny having to sit down and think about this as buckaroo straps on his guns
changes his torn and shredded jacket
penny looking at a buckaroo banzai comic book on the night stand
then at the framed photograph of peggy
god shes so young and beautiful
i dont remember her at all
which i guess is good under the circumstances
i bet youll never forget her though
one look at buckaroo says it all
i gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings ive got mixed emotions i dont know if i can handle this
i gotta go
were on borrowed time
wherere you going
squatting close to her please penny
you just gotta trust me now
and dont panic
because its gonna be all right
if we just believe in buckaroo banzai
and maybe more important if you believe in yourself
believe in penny priddy
penny looks into his eyes
youve got your six guns strapped on
youre ridding off on another adventure
oh my god its all real
it really is real
i should go with you
its too dangerous
thats just what you would say
this is so unreal
starry eyed she leans forward to kiss him buckaroo about to oblige when their fingers touch penny getting a mild electrical shock
the door suddenly opens and perfect tommy sticks his head in
sorry what is it tommy
someone broke into the jet car
and things are going haywire over at the lab
buckaroo running for the door calling over his shoulder to penny stay here ill be back
i wont hold my breath
buckaroo the cavaliers and the lindleys race out of the house toward the research building
penny hurriedly changes clothes
puts on peggys clothes
when suddenly the sight of john oconnor standing in the hallway door leering at her
whadda you want
john oconnor remembering her from the press conference
nothing right now penny priddy
john oconnor vanishing
penny again at a loss
buckaroo and the cavaliers running inside racing up a bright yellow staircase to the second floor
buckaroo and the cavaliers entering finding the motionless lab assistant in professor hikitas wrecked laboratory
wheres the professor
whod do a thing like this
they cant be far
shots of cavaliers in empty hallways guns drawn discovering evidence of intruders
offices ransacked furniture upset
experiments fouled buckaroo turning a corner finding a small amount of smoke in the hallway
turning the corner
stepping into a large room clouded with smoke from a burning file cabinet rawhide and a hulding form struggling in the gloom
buckaroo unable to get a clear shot at the beast when suddenly rawhide succeeds in knocking his adversary to the floor the man look out buckaroo
rawhide putting himself in the line of fire suddenly clutching his lower back
buckaroo starting toward rawhide but
buckaroo turning as the shadow of the alien john oconnor falls on his back
buckaroo firing his guns wounding the creature the disoriented figure retreating out into the corridor as buckaroo turns in time to see rawhides assailant dive into a hole in the
a hole in the floor
just grazed me
the professors under the floor too
with the overthruster
buckaroo edging toward that strange orifice in the linoleum going into it himself
as penny rushes in her ears picking up weird noises
the sound of people in the acoustical tiles overhead
penny trying to follow the racket down the first floor hallway
buckaroo in the dim light of the crawl space making his way past air conditioning ducts toward the sound of someone or something crawling up ahead
sounds in the darkness buckaroo holding his pistol still at the ready but useless in these cramped quarters
buckaroo finding a worklight flicking it on
penny meanwhile following the noises and voices overhead into an empty office grabbing a ladder and knocking out a ceiling panel
unfortunately someone else is watching penny from inside that very office
the wounded john oconnor sitting in a swivel desk chair behind the door oozing blood of a strange color and consistency staring ferociously at penny
more clatter overhead
as penny elevates herself partially into the hole
professor hikita only yards away on his belly able to come no further unable to wedge himself beneath a large duct
the arachtoid john bigboote closing in behind the professor
buckaroo closing in behind bigboote
take it young lady
unseen by john bigboote the overthruster skittering across the crawl space and into pennys hands
penny stepping down off the chair and onto the desk top her back still to the wounded john oconnor as she quickly stuffs the overthruster into her purse
an action unseen by the ghastly bleeding thug who
buckaroo advancing toward the professor
go back buckaroo
the arachtoid john bigboote whirling firing a stinger that whizzes past buckaroos head missing by inches
as buckaroo fires twice
john bigboote screaming
kicking at a small fresh air vent somehow squeezing his huge body out the tiny opening like a rat
buckaroo helping professor hikita up out of the floor
rawhide lying very still now surrounded by reno perfect tommy and new jersey
one look between new jersey and buckaroo sufficient to tell us that rawhide hasnt got a chance
buckaroo kneeling beside his old pal rawhide forcing a smile
youre a welcome sight
just grazed you huh
new jersey extracting a strange many pronged stinger from rawhides back
buckaroo looking at it
rawhide maintaining a sense of humor
so i was right
thats nice to know
across the room pinky carruthers comes in with casper and scooter lindley and that black man from planet john parker
we found the guy rawhide sucker dug a hole and tried to
pinkys words catching in his throat as he sees rawhides condition
buckaroo turning seeing not a guy but a giant arachtoid standing there
rawhide fading fast buckaroo lobbing the stinger to john parker
any antidote for these things
john parker holding the stinger in his palm
as it suddenly comes alive
he drops it to the floor stomps it to death
that mean youre on our side
sinking we gotta stop em buckaroo
buckaroo turning from the black arachtoid to his dying buddy
we will old fried we will
sure do pack a mean wallop
but rawhide closing his eyes for the final time as buckaroo feels for a pulse
the look in the great mans eyes saying it all
sadness mixed with anger
theres another one we owe em
theyre stealing my chopper
the cavaliers racing for the window
and they got penny
she has the overthruster
then your planet is doomed
calmer well get it back
buckaroo shoving perfect tommy aside at the window himself now
a fleeting glimpse of the stolen lindley chopper
close on the familiar face of the secretary of defense seen from an unusual angle
pulling back to reveal president widmark lying on his belly surrounded by the electronics of his temporary set of government staring down at a special mirror that reflects his secretary
of defense the secretary pressing a point further an igniting a camel with a lighter from the presidents nightstand
its not buckaroo banzai per se mr
its his men
some of then foreigners
asiatics their names changed their true backgrounds shrouded in secrecy
i mean when you come right up against it what do we really know about any of em
a nurse appears with two little pills
thesell make you a tenny bit drowsy mr
thats okay bonnie i wont be operating any heavy machinery today
desperate weve never had a weapon like the jet car in the past mr
light weight highly mobile stick on some anti tank missiles a couple grenade launchers hell we could buy ourselves two hundred jet cars for the price of ten tanks send
em swarming all over ivan like bumble bees sir right clear through their precious little iron curtain like it was swiss cheese
they gotta be just scared shitless
as are all sane men today
hey and me too
thats why im saying until buckaroo banzai agrees to submit his boys to at least a routine government security check that jet car should be in the hands of defense
and if they wont sell us the technology then mr
president by god sir we have got to take it
in the national interest
the lighter in the secretarys hand suddenly beeping startling him and prompting the president to claim the gizmo and point it at
an astounding tv telephone where the face of buckaroo banzai world watch one
direct incoming transmission
hows my favorite patient
that which does not kill us makes us stronger buckaroo
whats it like out there in the real world
secretary of defense mckinley stepping around behind the bed coming into buckaroos field of vision
not too terrific sir
i apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space and it looks like the earths caught in a crossfire
youre gonna have to repeat that i think buckaroo
on a highway somewhere near the eastern seaboard buckaroos bus speeds toward yoyodyne
buckaroo standing at a tv telephone in his mobile electronic nerve center the arachtoidal john parker right at his side amid a flurry of activity
technicians accumulating info on the alien father ship from to cut right to the bottom line on this sir we have reason to believe that there are moving freely among
us vicious red aliens disguised as the owners and operators of yoyodyne propulsion systems
perfect tommy reno even casper lindley coming in and out of the picture transforming themselves into a crack commando unit donning assault chemical warfare uniforms
little scooter lindley among them too doing like his dad
the people working on our truncheon bomber
under control of alien nationals
commies you say
new jersey studying an initial computer enhancement of the awesome not exactly mr
giant red arachtoids camouflaged as human beings
and what theyre really building forget your truncheon bomber mr
secretary is this enormous rocketship to escape back through the eighth dimension and then on to planet
now wait one second
the gentleman standing here with me is called john parker and he can corroborate everything ive said because hes from planet too
the president dumbfounded
john parker on tv appearing as nothing more than a wild and wooly rastafarian
you and i we go back a long long way together
interrupting time is short mr
to prevent john whorfins escape my comrades are at this moment taking up a geostationary position over new jersey
this situation is explosive
what are you saying man
some kind of race war in new jersey
this man as you call him is not a human being mr
hes a black arachtoid
thats some kind of spider isnt it
new jersey joins professor hikita at a microscope analyzing a slide smeared with that weird alien blood
buckaroo my good friend
id like to help you
but dont you think i wouldve heard from my sac radar by now if
sac wouldnt know what to look for sir
because these black arachtoids are cleverly hidden inside a huge thundercloud
the secretary of defense takes action picks up a phone
get me john bigboote at yoyodyne propulsion systems inc
to the president the fbi
lets see if this spades wanted
what the hells his name again
i have delivered a hologram from my president john emdall who has made it clear that unless john whorfin is destroyed at once she intends to fire an atomic beam
from your american airspace
hit smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war mr
a thermonuclear holocaust sir
these creatures from planet are ready to exploit soviet american tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth sir if necessary
youre quite serious about this arent you buckaroo
we know each other pretty well i think

nothing out of the you know ordinary
i know youre busy
whens good for you
im writing it down in my book

uncle sams treat
the secretary writes nothing down hangs up looking unsatisfied with the conversation just concluded
buckaroo glancing over at professor hikita and new jersey the latter squinting into the microscope
i dont know what to say buckaroo
aliens from planet nuclear extortion spiders in thunder clouds a girl named john
theres your answer
electromagnetic bacterial crap
we inhale the bacteria
it swims to our cerebral cortex and reprograms our consciousness
we only see what they want us to see
john parker nearby helping reno synthesize more of professor hikitas arachtoidal antidote and pour the liquid into gas mask filters
secretary of defense mckinley stepping closer into the picture
just curious buckaroo but wheres the jet car at these days
ive got it mr
but unfortunately the oscillation overthruster is in penny priddys possession and shes been kidnapped and taken to yoyodyne further exacerbating the situation
were on our way there right now
who the hells penny priddy
the secretary of defense giving the president a sly i told you so look
perfect tommy coming over interrupting
buckaroo john parker has the arachtoid cloud on line
excuse me a moment mr
were talking to the cloud right now
and his image fades
the president picks up the phone
well if it wasnt buckaroo banzai id say commit the man
get me sac hq omaha norad and the strategic space command
i want some hard data on that cloud
we got any killer satellites over jersey
everyone studying a much more detailed computer enhancement of the alien cloud
the alien john parker on the phone whispering
theyre armed for bear buckaroo
check out those radiation levels
to john parker john parker tell them were doing our best
into phone buckaroo banzai says patience is a virtue wing commander sir
perfect tommy interrupting again holding yet another telephone
its whorfin buckaroo
does he know were coming
meanwhile in a grimy narrow control booth high above the factory floor a terrified penny priddy sits bound and gagged john oconnor spreading the contents from a honey bear squeeze
bottle over her naked arms while long trails of ordinary picnic ants make their way up her legs
john bigboote looking on
pennys unopened big clear plastic purse on doctor lizardos desk the overthruster right under his nose and he doesnt even know it as he speaks into the phone handed to
him by an assistant
begin well well
perhaps you dont remember me
ah im flattered
we know the same people
in fact one of them is here with me now
your associate doctor penny priddy
may i pass along my congratulations for your great achievement
in the miserable annals of the earth you will be duly enshrined
a pause miss priddy claims to be unable to solve my problem
and provide the crucial missing circuit for my overthruster
perhaps you can convince her to try
lizardo holding the phone toward penny ripping her gag off
im not worth it buckaroo
are you all right
doctor lizardo yanking the phone from penny remaining silent for a second to torture buckaroos soul
she knows nothing lizardo
then shall we say a penny for your thoughts
you can come in her place
come alone with your overthruster
hanging up hell bring it
i know his type
penny glancing surreptitiously at her large transparent purse the take her to the pit
use more honey
find out what she knows
smiling smugly lizardo heads for the door penny squirming in her seat as the tiny ants dig in
who are you
the scourge of burma
the pivot of mystery
well youre not destroying me like you did my sister
lizardo simply sneering at her as he goes out the door
a flurry of well ordered activity taking place
hong kong cavaliers and blue shield irregulars along with pinky carruthers
casper and scooter
sitting up front like paratroopers cleaning their back pack flamethrowers
sawed off shotguns
buckaroo giving them a chalk talk an aerial photograph of yoyodyne on the clear plexiglas blackboard
these antidote filters the professors whipped up will let you to see them like i have since yesterday as arachtoidal creatures
they wont be pretty nothing personal john parker
but just remember
if we fail tonight theres no tomorrow
they will never surrender
they will fight to the end
the cavaliers breating their antidote filters horror
casper and scooter lindley especially unsettled
im working under the assumption that penny still has the overthruster
thatll be my job get it back in one piece
heres the main gate
ill pass through first alone
the rest of you divide into two strike groups apache team
thats you reno
and chaparral team perfect tommy
john parkerll ride with chaparral
perfect tommy not too thrilled about that
top priority is the overthruster
whorfin cant escape without it
the built in tracking device should make it relatively simple to locate
maybe hard to get
penny being dragged by john oconnor through a slimy underground corridor past a strange piece of machinery
the president of the united states talks into a cigarette lighter and peeks up a nurses skirt by means of his floor mirror
mirrored pov the nurses reflection replaced by that of his national buckaroo come in
how does this damn thing work
can anybody figure this lighter out
i think the flint
whats happening with my call to sac
still no confirmation either from sac or strategic space command
they report all surveillance satellite communication jammed
possible atmospheric condition sir
its unusual but no cause for alarm
intelligence reports the soviets are having the same problem
should we be on code red
we go to code red the russians go to code red
no sense jumping off half cocked mr
the president twisting around to glower at catburd eating an orange sitting near a table of flowers and fruit baskets
i dont know
buckaroo banzais never been wrong before
senator cunningham pacing nervously
the man went through solid matter for crying out loud
who knows what it did to his brain
maybe scrambled his molecules
all im saying is lets not panic here
im sure theres a rational explanation
turning from a strange phone russian radar is down sir
theyve just gone to code red
and then calmly and quietly weve got no choice then
call my wife
the national security advisor turning back to his telephone code red
butch says were crimson
president none of us here are lunatics or irrational men
looking at cunningham or persons
im a soldier and im a damn good one enough decorations to snap a christmas tree but i dont mind telling you im sure i speak for everyone in this
room when i say i am scared
im barely holding my fudge right now
stop acting like a goddamn schoolgirl general and pull yourself together
im glad someone has the balls to face facts
pause forget were the good guys and wed never attack first
they think were godless monsters just like them
put yourself in their samovars
sitting in the dark without radar bells ringing all over the damn kremlin little men in fedora hats getting out of zils coming into the great hall of the people
now do you think theyre gonna listen to reason
ill give buckaroo his planet space cloud but do you think they will
being handed a dispatch soviet radar is down sir and so is ours
were both totally defenseless
more or less
so whats our counter option general catburd
earn your salary
i guess we have to prick this boil and take the heat sir
hit em primero
blast em off the face of the earth before they lose their heads and do it to us first
larry wheres my football
out in the hall sir
an apple cheeked marine lieutenant sits watching a television soap opera only the sinister black briefcase chained to his wrist setting him apart from missions of other viewers
general catburd sticking his head out of the presidents room
whatre you waiting for boy
get in here with that thing
as an out of breath mrs
johnson rounds the corner on rollerskates out foxing secret service agents and the rest of the presidents entourage cutting through clutching the yellow record
for the president
from buckaroo banzai
a dimly lighted parking lot not far from yoyodyne
a kolodny bros
plumbing van arrives disgorging several tough blue shields as buckaroo and professor hikita confer
the alien john parker doing some highly unusual warm up exercises on the tarmac
reno telling the arriving blue shields were waiting for the jet car
billys bringing it
asshole probably got lost
or nailed for speeding
can i have everyones attention
im not a rah rah kinda guy and im not much for speeches but things could get rough out there tonight
its a fight we didnt ask for but its a fight were stuck with and we all saw what happened to rawhide
so if for any reason this is good bye i want you all to know that
you crazy lugs
buckaroo finding it difficult to put into words what they all mean to him the cavaliers smiling needling him
you trying to tell us something
the jet car racing up skidding to a stop billy jumping out the big engine still running
lets just fry those arachtoids
buckaroo embracing professor hikita turning back to his men pulling on his helmet give me thirty minutes
then come in and mop up
buckaroo tossing a quick blue shield salute shutting himself into his speed machine
hikitas pov as buckaroo blasts off
an exhaust trail of white smoke as he rockets up the highway
penny priddy more bedraggled and filthy than ever being dragged by john oconnor deeper into the bowels of yoyodyne down a flooded subterranean corridor
close on the presidents face
john emdalls voice over
talking thermonuclear war
wrapping her speech up
thats certainly food for thought
johnson lifting the needle off the smoking record
as the presidents national security advisor places a call on that ominous strange phone a palpable tension rising urgency bordering on panic
general catburd and the young marine lieutenant rummaging through a confusion of envelops in the black briefcase
no answer at the kremlin sir
just dead silence
here you go mr
the sealed authenticators
the plan d documents for your eyes only
john hancock these and we got ourselves a knockout little force posture
you know on second thought maybe we should think this through a bit more so that future generations of
the lights in the room start to blink on and off
silencing the senator
catburd handing the president a writing implement
pulling out a special writing tray from the bed
name of the enemy
my hands shaking
how on earth can i even
have to stay awake alert
thats my job
thats what the people put me here for
meanwhile inside the strange vaporous entity
black creatures scuttle about their jobs in semi darkness monitoring the earth below
where is buckaroo banzai
john parker tells us hes approaching yoyodyne wing commander sir
keep me posted
as buckaroo arrives in his jet car
red arachtoid guards unlocking the chain link barrier swinging it open
in the nerve center of yoyodyne a nervous john bigboote watches dr
lizardo addressing his ragtag followers on the floor below
bigboote with his hands on lizardos mike cord trying to get up enough nerve to pull the plug on his boss
blacks are on this planet
here in new jersey
coming to destroy us
we must move
escape or die
over lizardos shoulder a view down below on the littered floor of a huge aircraft factory that houses a giant spoaceship of bizarre design a customized wingless jagged the entire
vehicle suspended twenty feet off the floor on movable cranes work ladders stretching up to its several doors
you must work faster to finish the great vehicle
so that we can enter the eighth dimension and free our trapped comrades
so we can return to our homeland and seize power once again
lizardos followers extending their three fingered hands in fascist salutes as he whips them into a feverish state where are we going
lizardo peers down at the hangar floor
his pov of the jet car locked in the iron jaws of a gigantic rolling the jet cars engine shut down buckaroo checking his overthruster homing device as hes trundled
toward john gomez in a graveyard of huge yellow spikes his eyes taking in everything from the last minute preparation of the giant spacecraft to buckaroos pov
the evil figures of dr
lizardo and john bigboote standing high in the speed operators pulpit
buckaroo yanked out of the cockpit
john gomez poking at the jet cars dashboard ripping out its cassette deck finding the crucial overthruster missing and shaking his head in lizardos direction
an angry john bigboote racing down the stairs toward the jet car
as over the public address booms i thought you had it
for that seemingly flippant but honest answer buckaroo gets punched by john bigboote
doubling him over
take him to the shock tower
murky dank an insect paradise
buckaroo standing trapped inside an electromagnetic field
john bigboote looking on
lizardo flashing two separate incredibly complex electrical diagrams on a monitor screen in rapid fire order
the shock tower is a lie detector
any untruth triggers a brutal charge to your auditory meatus
youre not getting a damn thing outta me until pennys safe
curse you banzai
dont you realize what youre saying
your planets about to be destroyed and youre wasting time like this
ive got nothing but time
sealed with a curse as sharp as a knife
doomed is your soul and damned is your life
lizardo pressing a button administering a second shock to buckaroo while an aide turns a dial increasing the voltage i want my missing circuit now
a view over the secretary of defenses shoulder as the chopper descends lands in a parking lot where buckaroos bus sits guarded by cavaliers and blue shields
the camera following the secretary right out into it all
a carpet cleaning van arriving three more tough blue who the hell are those guys
buckaroo still held in his electric straitjacket
lizardo nodding to the arachtoid in charge of a bank of glowing closed circuit tv sets
the same picture popping onto every set penny hanging in the you bloody
for a while and she wont enjoy it
lizardo indicates his favorite monitor
the incomplete overthruster equation flashing across its face
only you can save her from the fate of your friend mr
solve this equation
i must have the crucial missing circuit
close on the monitor
a riot of circuits and junctions
the missing circuits in your head whorfin
how do you know thats my real name
john emdall told me
buckaroo smiles at lizardos surprise lizardo signaling john bigboote who turns on the voltage zapping buckaroo
the secretary of defense pacing the aisle of the bus looking at his watch while the cavaliers and newly arrived blue shields conceal their eagerness for battle
checking watches cleaning weapons
anybody got a report anybody got anything
or are we still blacked out
perfect tommy looking back into world watch one
partly cloudy tomorrow
this bus should be in the hands of defense
scooter lindley wearing a gas mask approaches the alien john parker with a blue shield ballpoint pen and a piece of paper
could i have your autograph mr
john parker at first not understanding the nature of the request
looking at the ball point pen scooter flipping the point for him
say to my best friend scooter
you got it
the secretary of defense nervously cracking his knuckles
moving up the aisle suddenly screaming what the hell are we doing
i dont believe this
whatre we waiting for
checking his watch ten minutes more
im the eyes and ears of the president of these united states of america
in loco presidentis
which means im in charge here
not on this bus youre not
who the hell do you think you are
that answer alone enough to drive the secretary up the wall
well let me tell you something mr
perfect tommy i dont need this shit
i could be on easy street with a cushy job in the private sector
but instead i got me a nine hundred million dollar way the hell behind schedule top secret bomber being built down there by yoyodyne propulsion systems and i dont intend
to set twiddling thumbs in a bus while buckaroo banzai goes crashing around my airplane looking for his damn girlfriend driving a car that itself is probably worth more to this country than all the tea in china
im talking national security risk and we are going in there like gentlemen and straighten this thing out before somebody gets hurt
you got that
the secretary suddenly grabbing a weapon from a surprised blue shield and turning it toward the driver
hit it soldier boy
move this buggy
thats a goddamn executive order
with his weapon trained on the driver whos to stop him
go ahead louie do like the man says
the double bus leaping forward heading down the long approach road to yoyodyne
past a billboard touting the aerospace achievements of
yoyodyne an exciting growing company
just one mile the cavaliers letting the secretary of defense call the shots for the moment talking among themselves perfect tommy squelching any notion of knocking off their hysterical hijacker
whispering hey so we get into action quicker this way
we tell buckaroo our watches were fast
ordinary citizen john parker taking a step toward the secretary offering him a gas mask
the secretary turning on him
thats far enough black boy
a mystified john parker stepping back
angle toward windshield
the secretary peering through the windshield at the chain link gates coming into view
yoyodyne an equal ill handle the negotiations here
to the driver slow her down
the secretary getting out coming around to the redheaded yoyodyne guards who try to peer in through the bus tinted windows
you fellas got a phone
ring ahead and get me john bigboote
hell ill do it yourself if i want it done right huh
the secretary pushing the astonished guards aside and picking up the telephone the guards trying to stop him and in the process turning their backs on the bus as it
silently cruises past the gate into the bus coming to a stop in a scrap metal dump inside the big compound cavaliers and blue shields piling out going with their assigned groups
perfect tommys chaparral team following john parker toward a normal looking building
under here i think
but john parker entering a crawl space beneath the huge building
chaparral team having no choice following
the secretary of defense struggling with the guards for possession of the phone drawing his stolen weapon
now you get this straight
youre up to your ass in alligators and im here to drain the swamp
so im gonna use this phone
because it is all over for you baby blue
picking up the phone this is the secretary of defense at the poorly guarded west gate
i wanna speak to john bigboote person to person
renos apache team casper and scooter on board finds yet another underground entrance to the main building slips in
chaparral team the alien john parker perfect tommy in the strange labyrinth of dark low ceilinged passageways making their way cautiously
hope you know where youre going john parker
because my nose is starting to whistle
a form suddenly dropping from the ceiling landing on perfect tommy a fierce struggle in the darkness
john parker to the rescue garroting a red arachtoid perfect tommy helping himself up
dont mention it
then i wont
john parker leading the way again up some unusual stairs
into the main bivouac room red arachtoids apparently asleep in bizarre tents others hanging from the ceiling like sloths a strange heavy humming noise starting to fill the room
they sense us
john parker breaking into a run for the far end of the room perfect tommy and the others following john parker hitting the door
and an alarm goes off
perfect tommy opening fire at a huge generator
the lights pulsing
electiricity failing in the murky torture chamber giving buckaroo just the change he needs to break free of the shock tower
buckaroo ducking into a recessed doorway taking cover against a wall wet with strange algae as various arachtoid guards scramble past alarm to bigboote kill the girl
buckaroo losing sight of the swift arachtoid john bigboote resorting instead to his electronic tracking device while
reno new jersey and pinky carruthers bring apache team down a flooded corridor meeting some opposition
buckaroo spotting new jersey in the confusion the two of them tracking penny electronically descending concrete steps moving down a dark corridor that we recognize
the secretary of defense meanwhile reaching the big hangar confused alarmed chaos everywhere shouting over the din bigboote
spotting john bigboote across the hangar floor going after him staring bug eyed at the monstrous looking spacecraft suspended above the hangar floor
what the hell
that aint no truncheon bomber my friend
i never approved that
the secretary following the speedy john bigboote around a bend unable to keep up
bigboote giving no indication of seeing him rounding a corner ducking into his office
the secretary rounding the corner too but seeing no sign of bigboote
instead just an office door a nameplate reading john bigboote executive vice president
the secretary of defense opening the door
moving past a vacant receptionists desk to john bigbootes cavernous strangely furnished chamber
you can run but you cant hide
i want some facts
but no sign of john bigboote
buckaroo and new jersey still tracking penny moving through another flooded slimy corridor we remember
the secretary spying a phone on the receptionists desk amid scattered oreo cookies picking the phone up clicking it a couple of times to get a dial tone
totally ignoring an amazing framed picture operator
how the hell does a person get an outside line around here
his gaze now focusing squarely on that cheap framed photograph of the red arachtoids
secretary mckinley losing his bearings
his mind reeling refusing to accept the obvious the oddly designed furniture and chairs in the room somehow insect like
a sudden sound
a womans scream that seems to come from
underneath the floor
the secretary cocking his weapon and stepping around the desk as an amazing thing occurs
a trapdoor in the office floor opening the secretary going to investigate able to observe
his pov of
john oconnor coming up a ladder and in the room below a barely conscious penny still in her private hell trussed and taped ants crawling on her arms
the lurid specter of john bigboote staring at her
pennys clear plastic purse unopened on the desk beside her as the secretary of defense suddenly knocks john oconnor down the ladder and jumps into the room injuring his ankle
what the hells is going on here bigboote
wheres my bomber
i dont give a flying handshake what it is
wheres my bomber
lets just climb upstairs to my office and discuss this like two reasonable
your private lifes your own concern pal
where the hell is my bomber
look at this place
wheres your pride
its like a pigsty down here
the telescoping arm of john bigboote suddenly shooting out and lifting the secretary off the floor banging him into the wall
its not my goddamn planet
understand monkey boy
bizarre lamps swaying as gunfire upstairs prompts bigboote to release the secretary to urge oconnor to head for a door off the hallway
but john whorfin said kill her
damn john whorfin
bigboote and oconnor emerging in the hallway
seen by buckaroo banzai and new jersey as red arachtoids
look out buckaroo banzai
buckaroo turning and just in time the alien john gomez right behind him
and behind gomez john parker and perfect tommy with flame throwers
buckaroo and new jersey hitting the deck as the red arachtoid gets smoked the aliens john bigboote and john oconnor escaping in the confusion
the secretary of defense still on the floor spotting the overthruster in pennys purse taking it just as buckaroo and new jersey rush into the room
the secretary struggling to his feet as buckaroo cuts penny down
spraying her with a white insecticide new jersey checking her vital signs buckaroo shocking new jersey accidentally with a jolt of static electricity as the secretary slips the overthruster under
to no one in particular its not over yet
ill bounce back
ill come through this thing smelling like a goddamn rose just watch me
the secretary limping out of the room
new jersey trying to get pennys pulse while buckaroo peels back her eyelids
leave her to me
you take care of business
buckaroo looking at new jersey knowing he can trust him rummaging through pennys purse
lizardo and the alien john oconnor and the alien john bigboote seeing their deteriorating position over a closed circuit tv
video sound the call to board ship
without the crucial missing circuit
well never make it
they are only monkey boys
we can still crush them here
lizardo picking up a primitive incomplete overthruster the size of an you heard my orders
activate the special horns
buckaroo joining the alien john parker the two of them tearing down one of the flooded passages
suddenly covering their ears from those secretary of defense mckinley makes his way through several red arachtoids running in blind panic
the light of a new day starting to glow through grimy windows
as down on the floor dr
lizardo is about to scale a spindly ladder into his big suspended spaceship
lizardo spotting buckaroo john parker and hong kong cavaliers entering this sacred space
lizardo pushing his own soldiers aside scurrying into his spaceship with john bigboote and john oconnor
no sooner inside than a cowardly order is issued to john oconnor close the doors
meanwhile the floor of the hangar
the alien john parker using strange judo the amazing blue shields fighting like samurai ducking stingers fireing into the enemy at point blank range
buckaroo seeing dr
lizardos engine start up clouds of black smoke pouring from the exhaust pipes
john parker fighting his way toward the ship
while over yonder the secretary of defense spots the jet car unattended amid that field of weird yellow totems
john parker reaching the big spaceship to find buckaroo already there buckaroo taking the lead up a tall ladder that seems to reach to a rear buckaroo settling into a
weird little chair john parker at his side facing the opposite direction in a love seat arrangement
at a wall cluttered with confusing instruments and a framed photo of lizardo
no what is this thing
dont look at me buckaroo banzai
i failed flight school
john bigboote in the co pilots seat as doctor lizardo attempts to connect his clumsy overthruster
overthruster in place
it wont work
shut up john bigboote you coward
john oconnor pushing john bigboote aside as lizardo hits another switch and for a fraction of a second all hell breaks loose a blinding the spacecraft lurches forward twelve feet
again john oconnor
they havent got enough power
theyll never penetrate
lizardo a raging madman in the cockpit using a radio mike almost
lower my vehicle onto the runway
were going down
onto the runway
the doors locked
meanwhile unnoticed secretary of defense john mckinley reaches the jet car starts to climb in
another step ill drink your blood
the secretary turning not seeing anyone at first
then little scooter lindley with an m trained on him
get em up
scooter means business
as he suddenly demonstrates blowing away an oncoming arachtoid before turning the gun back on the secretary who raises his hands
scooter taking the curious object from his prisoner not fooled for a second
awful thumping vibrarions as john oconnor hits the overthruster switch again
lizardo and john oconnor ecstatic
john bigboote terrified
buckaroo and john parker rattling in their seats
the sudden expulsion by the wall of a tweedy fleshy object resembling a lump of clay which rapidly begins to define itself as the real model black haired doctor lizardo
standing in total bewilderment several th century buccaneers spit out next equally disoriented
the other lizardo whorfin meanwhile undergoing a painful reverse transformation from old man back to red arachtoid
his eyes full speed ahead
we havent a chance
your overthrusters for shit
well all just
one more word out of you bigboote
whorfins arm elongating flashing out breaking john bigbootes neck
john oconnor moving up a notch at yoyodyne
buckaroo and john parker picking up all of whorfins intraship communications
full speed ahead
their pov of the hanger area nightmarish excitement down below
the floor rushing up as
the big spaceship makes violent contact with its runway rocketing ahead
the cockpit pov as the ship rushes toward the wall
the real doctor emillio lizardo barely ducking out of the way
the big spaceship crashing through the hangar wall clumsy heavy
whorfins big spaceship lifting off into the dark morning sky taking buckaroo and john parker with it on its wobbly the crew of black arachtoids aboard the ethereal father ship
also at their battle stations
banzai has failed
john whorfin is airborne
but not in the eighth dimension
shouldnt we wait
maybe john parker i have my order from john emdall
activate particle beam
lock on smolensk
john parker fiddling with a radio homing in on the black ships frequency overhearing particle beam activated
lock on smolensk
one minute to rapid rupture
tell them to stop
theyre your friends
i lack the authority buckaroo banzai
at least tell them im trying
tell em something
john parker talking to the father ship as buckaroo struggles to unlock the strange little saucer from whorfins big vehicle
devices outside holding the thermopod in place
close on dashboard
buckaroo finally finding the proper release switch
close on the suction bolts disengaging
freeing the small craft
his vehicle falling sideways john parker trying to ignite its engines
in a free fall the engines finally igniting and the thermopod rocketing upward
sir a thermopod has peeled off from whorfins ship
stand by to incinerate smolensk
buckaroo struggling to master the strange craft
does this thing have guns john parker
boy i hope so buckaroo banzai
john parker trying a likely button
spaceships thunder over the lights of the awakening city below
over radio twenty seconds to rapid rupture
prepare the heat shields
time running out
buckaroo receiving fire from whorfins big spaceship the small vehicle lurching
the two vehicles on a collision the little ship dropping like a stone barely avoiding a head on with whorfin and company
buckaroo unhappy with john parkers marksmanship
their love seat rotating reversing their functions
take the throttle john parker
john whorfin and john oconnor scrambling into evasive action but its too late
buckaroo banzai and john parker diving toward them their overthruster whorfin shaking his red fist in defiance
ill see you in hell
flying on a collision course once again the overthruster beam finally hitting home and the big spaceship disintegrating vaporizing
john whorfin and his ilk history
reverse angle on john parker
still on a collision course with the pull up
we did it
holy shit we did it
now buckaroo banzai
as the cavaliers and blue shields anxiously watch the sky crackles and john whorfin destroyed
deactivate particle beam
tracking zero zero zero
the sun coming up
and as we wonder what terrible fate has befallen buckaroo banzai and john parker
a tiny figure appears high in the clouds
a bizarre parachute catching the wind floating lazily to earth
closer shot buckaroo
safe and sound looking up and saluting john parker as the little thermopod flip flops tumbles heavenward at an incredible rate of speed
buckaroo touching down
professor hikita among the victorious blue shields scarcely able to believe his eyes as he spots
no it cant be
rising from the debris
now its the young doctor lizardos turn to stare incredulously
ill be damned
the two scientists approaching one another
afraid to touch as if the other might prove a mirage
reno finding a cutlass on the ground
as buckaroo face blackened with soot his clothing torn hurries toward several blue shields gas masks off herding a half dozen human prisoners while other shields and cavaliers share congratulatory
red stingers still stuck in their bullet proof vests
all accounted for
new jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire
quite a guy if you want my opinion
perfect tommy and reno pacing buckaroo
got a casualty list
just their side
whatre we gonna do with these people
theyre illegal aliens the way i figure been here forty years you could throw the book at em
and ask the american taxpayer to foot the bill
send em back to the eighth dimension as soon as we find the overthruster
it wasnt in pennys purse
so if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out
perfect tommy whistling
hey scooter lindley fall in
scooters eyes lighting up as he runs over
is this what youre looking for buckaroo
the oscillation overthruster safe and sound
buckaroo amazed receiving the precious object giving scooter a blue shield salute
the secretary of defense watching jealously from a short distance his clothing disheveled
looks like one junior shield is in line for a ride in the jet car
wow you know it
suddenly crestfallen ill have to ask my dad
well go ahead whatre you waiting for
scooter running off
a dour faced shaken new jersey appears in the doorway of the big bus buckaroos smile immediately vanishing
i did all i could
i did my best
buckaroo racing past new jersey and into the bus
buckaroo hurrying through the front section
buckaroo hurrying through the communications nerve center
buckaroo reno said check with you something about pirates
he mean the baseball team
buckaroo the presidents on line on
calling about is everything okay with the alien space cloud and planet ten
or should he just go ahead and destroy russia
tell him yes on and no on
buckaroo going into his private rear section of the bus
which was yes
buckaroo reaching his private quarters finding penny on his cot a sheet pulled over her face
ethereal morning light caressing her still body
buckaroo distraught pulling the sheet back to reveal penny in final repose speckled with dead ants honey and powdery white insecticide
buckaroo leaning toward her in wordless anguish
his lips moving toward hers
when suddenly a spark leaps out arcing and she stirs
a faint nerve response buckaroo seizing her with both hands
shaking her exhorting her
open your eyes
look at me
but nothing no more signs of life
buckaroo kissing her in despair pressing his lips against her lips
the kiss of the century a powerful electric jolt
the fire of life as penny opens her eyes sees her haggard hero before her
you look awful
and indeed they both do but who cares
another galvanic kiss crackling good as the tiny bedroom heats up and we do the decent thing
as credits roll and the fantastic voice of dr
buckaroo banzai serenades us home
the hong kong cavaliers harmonizing like honey the world once again a safe snug harbor
