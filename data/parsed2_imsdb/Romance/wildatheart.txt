href b b a love story written by david lynch based on the book by barry gifford and now the story of sailor and lula
a man rides a screaming massive japanese motorcycle wound out to maximum r
up the street
the sign reads kids playing speed bumps
with a whine from hell the front tire of the motorcycle hits a speed bump
the motorcycle becomes airborne and on the way up slices itself in half as it scrapes along the full length of a datsun kingcab
in the air the rider and motorcycle twist violently as they fly by
the motorcycle bounces off a black chevrolet and makes a sound like the end of the world
the rider hits the same chevy a moment later
like a broken ragdoll shot from a canon the man punches through the back window blowing glass for a block
he stops somewhere under the front seat and a bubble of blood forms out his nose
the motorcycle continues on sliding and spinning with an ear piercing howl for one entire city block
two rabid dogs fight ferociously in a vacant lot ripping each others flesh
an old couple both with walkers inch painfully along nearby
oh my god
why they doin that
who the hell knows
what you have in your mouth
the old woman begins to turn away covering her mouth with her hand
spit it out
pull your teeth out
what you tryin to do
spit it out
the old man grabs the old woman by the neck and squeezes
out comes a tangled and sticky ball of hard fruit candies
a thousand wasps hover threateningly in the air around the nest
a small group of hardened criminal nine year olds sporting hideous grins bat the nest violently to and fro with sticks
one kid busies himself shooting a large can of black flag garden spray into a crack in the nest
another stomps half dead wasps up and down the sidewalk
all the kids are making animal noises of one sort or the other
the telephone rings
marietta pace fortune a rich southern woman around fifty carries her martini and rossi sweet vermouth drink across the livingroom and answers the phone
who is this
a guard stands by as sailor ripley twenty three years old lost somewhere between the cool long gone generation and a used car salesman speaks on a prisoner phone in
a green cement cubicle with one bench
into phone sailor ripley
can i talk to lula
theres no way in hell you can speak to her and
feeling a smile coming on what
yes you heard me
dont ever call back here again
marietta hangs up the phone as lula pace fortune mariettas twenty year old daughter comes quickly down the stairs
you know who it was and you know you arent and i mean are not gonna see him ever
end of story
quietly like hell
marietta her hand still on the telephone grips the receiver so hard her knuckles turn white
lula enters her room and cranks up her stereo
speed metal music jumps up to around one hundred twenty decibels
the guard escorts sailor away from the telephone and back to his cell
the iron bars of the door slide across sailors face and close with a bang
a beat up red ford falcon station wagon filled with insane teenagers on speed and pcp race out of control down the street past the club leaning out the car
in every direction
they scream out to the desolate looking passerby
the camera cranes up to the neon club sign and gets lost among the hot pink neon the frantic moths and the intense electric buzz
lula and her friend beany thorn sit at a table drinking rum coca colas while watching and listening to a white blues band called the bleach boys
the group segues smoothly from elmore jamess dust my broom into robert johnsons me and the devil and beany lets out a snort
i can dig this music
but not that singer
hes right in the groove
hes so ugly
guys with beards and beer guts aint quite my type
giggles seeins how youre about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss dont know how you can criticize
yeah well if he says that all that flab turns into dick at midnight hes a liar
lula and beany laugh and swallow some of their drinks
so sailors gettin out soon and youre gonna see him
lula nods and crushes an ice cube with her back teeth and chews it
meetin him at the gate
that phone call this afternoon was the signal
my deranged mamas hid the keys to my car
but of course i know exactly where they are
i didnt hate me so much id feel better wishin you luck
cant all husbands be perfect and your elmo probly wouldnta ever got that second one pregnant you hadnt kicked his ass out
so youre gonna be needin the blue bird pretty soon
ill be makin the swap tomorrow and thanks again beany
the bleach boys kick into some kind of professor longhair swamp mambo
plumes of smoke from fires rise in the distance
an empty livingroom
the smoke from the city fire appears during the course of the dissolve to be in the livingroom then it disappears
an empty hallway
an empty stairway
feet lulas was across carpet
a closet door opens
a hand lulas reaches into the pocket of a coat in her mothers closet
the hand comes out clutching car keys
lula races down the stairs and through a door into the garage
the electronic garage door opens and lula drives her black camaro out and away
the garage door closes automatically
lula drives fast up a neighborhood street
she turns a corner and disappears
lula throws her car keys under the front seat and goes around to beanys dark blue thunderbird convertible fishes around under the t birds front seat for the keys finds
them jumps in and takes off
marietta leaves her cadillac seville in her driveway and enters the house
we can hear her calling out for lula in the distance
the calling changes it becomes angry
the garage door opens and marietta comes storming out
she leaps in her caddy and peels out
marietta enters the bar on the run
she calls out to the bartender
hes not in his office
havent seen im yet today marietta
slightly hysterical well i gotta find him right this minute
sailor is waiting out front as lula pulls up in her t bird throwing out a cloud of dust
theyre both smiling
they kiss tenderly and then sailor walks around the car to get in while lula opens up a suitcase and gets out his snakeskin jacket
hey my snakeskin jacket
did i ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom
bout fifty thousand times
i got us a room at the cape fear and guess what
i hear powermads at the hurricane
smiling stab it and steer
lula tromps it and throws out an even larger cloud of dust
sailor and lula lay on the bed in the cape fear hotel listening to the fan creak
did you ever think somethin like about the wicked witch of the east comin flyin in
did you ever think somethin and then later think youve said it out loud to someone
i really did miss your mind while i was out at pee dee honey
the rest of you too of course
but the way your head works is gods own private mystery
what was it you was thinkin
well i was thinkin about smokin actually
my mama smokes marlboros now used to be she smoked kools
i stole em from her beginnin in about sixth grade
when i got old enough to buy my own i bought those
now ive just about settled on mores as you probably noticed
i guess i started smokin when i was about six
my mama was already dead from lung cancer
what brandd she smoke
camels same as me
guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness
im sorry honey
i never would have guessed it
i hardly used to see them anyway
i didnt have much parental guiding
the public defender kept sayin that at my parole hearin
he was a good ol boy stood by me
even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time
id stand by you sailor
hell peanut you stuck with me after i planted bob ray lemon
a man cant ask for more than that
lula pulls sailor over to her and kisses him soft on the mouth
you move me sailor you really do
you mark me the deepest
sailor pulls down the sheet exposing lulas breasts
youre perfect for me too
you remind me of my daddy you know
mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies
he had a long nose too like theirs
did i ever tell you how he died
in a fire as i recall
started he couldnt remember things
got real violent
mama kept tellin me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin the old paint off our house without usin a mask
but i dont know
seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces
clyde fortune tears a door off the kitchen cabinets and strews the cabinet contents all across the counter and floor
he puts his fist through the kitchen window
he leaps on the counter and bats the kitchen ceiling light smashing it
he kicks over the refrigerator
lulas eyes look off remembering
finally in the middle of the one night with me and mama asleep upstairs
he poured kerosene over himself and lit a match
clyde fortune completely engulfed in fire races across and back the livingroom until he collapses in a fifties modern armchair
the drapes behind him burst in flames
voice over near burned down the house
we got out just in time
the whole livingroom goes up in flames
cu the red hot ash of lulas cigarette as she inhales deeply
as she exhales a cloud of smoke she turns to sailor
it was a year before i met you
sailor takes the cigarette out of lulas hand and puts it into the ashtray by her bed
he pulls her to him and kisses her throat
you have such a pretty long neck like a swan
grandmama pace had a long smooth white neck
it was like on a statue it was so white
sailor drifts his thumb over lulas left nipple then cups her breast in his hand
marietta pours johnnie farragut another shot of scotch
i knew this would happen
soon as that piece of filth got out of pee dee i knew thered be trouble
hes just got some kind of influence over her i cant decipher
theres somethin wild in lula i dont know where it comes from
you gotta find em johnnie
he served his time for what he did
if lula went with him of her own volition willingly that is there aint much can be done about it
dont talk down to me johnnie farragut
i know what volition means and thats why i want sailor ripley off the planet
hes pure slime and its leakin all over my baby
maybe you could push him into makin some kinda move and then kill him dead
youd only be defendin yourself and with his record nobodyd fuss
johnnie pours himself another tumblerful of walker black label
ill locate lula marietta and if shes with the ripley boy ill give him a talkin to and try to convince her to come back with me
thats about all i can do
he takes a long swallow from the tumbler
marietta begins to cry
she blubbers for a few seconds and then stops as abruptly as shed started
her grey eyes glaze over
ill hire a hit man if you dont want to help me stop this thing
ill call marcello santos
now marietta i am goin to help you
and dont be gettin carried away
you dont want to be bringin santos and his people into it
youre just jealous of santos cause hes sweet on me
darlin you aint seein santos again are ya
oh johnnie farragut
dont you trust your very own marietta
bein in love with you like i am brings out that ugly jealous side
well stop worryin about me and start worryin about how youre gonna get that lula back here and away from that murderer
sailor aint a murderer
you got to get off that kick
and fars i can tell sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin lula
even there he was protectin her
you oughta be thankin him for that
that bob ray lemon they say was comin after the both of em
why am i tellin you this you was around that night
you ought to know just exactly what happened
sailor just got a little too forceful is all
you remember that night
cu of marietta eyes as she thinks back
we see marietta standing in a carpeted hallway above the ballroom
dance band music can be heard in the distance
sailor appears coming up the hallway slightly drunk he carefully sets his drink on the carpet outside the mens room
mariettas pov of sailor entering the mens room
cu of mariettas glazed eyes and smiling face
mariettas pov of walking toward mens room
maybe i was there but i didnt see anythin
all i knows that trash killed a man with his bare hands
hands which are now probly all over my baby
marietta settle down now darlin
i want whats best for her too like i said ill do what i can to bring her home
lula is standing in the bathroom of their room at the hotel fooling with her hair in front of the mirror
sailor can see her through the doorway from where he lays on the bed
sailor you are somethin else honey
when i was fifteen mama told me that pretty soon id be startin to think about sex and i should talk to her before i did anything about it
but honey i thought you told me your uncle pooch raped you when you was thirteen
uncle pooch wasnt really an uncle
he was a business partner of my daddys
and my mama never knew nothin about me and him thats for damn sure
his real name was somethin kind of european like pucinski
but everyone just called him pooch
he came around the house sometimes when daddy was away
i always figured he was sweet on mama so when he cornered me one afternoon i was surprised moren a little
howd it happen peanut
he just pull out the old toad and let it croak
lula brushes away her bangs and frowns
she takes a cigarette from the pack on the sink and lights it then lets it dangle from her lips while she teases her hair
youre terrible crude sometimes sailor you know
i cant hardly understand you when you talk with one of them mores in your mouth
lula takes a long slow drag on her more and sets it down on the edge of the sink
i said you can be too crude sometimes
i dont think i care for it
go on and tell me how old pooch done the deed
well mama was at the busy bee havin her hair dyed
and i was alone in the house
we see what she talks about
voice over uncle pooch came in the side door through the porch you know
where i was makin a jelly and banana sandwich
i remember i had my hair in curlers cause i was goin that night with vicki and cherry ann the desoto sisters
uncle pooch must have known nobody but me was home cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the
didnt he say somethin
lula shakes her head
she picks up her cigarette takes a puff and throws it into the toilet
ecu of cigarette in toilet
least not so i recall now
lula flushes the toilet and watches the more come apart as it swirls down the hole
ecu of cigarette coming apart as it swirls
so howd he finally nail you
right there in the kitchen
no he picked me up
we see what she talks about
voice over he was short but powerful
with hairy arms
anyway he carried me into the maids dayroom which nobody used
we did it there on an old bed
we did it
didnt he force you
but he was super gentle you know
i mean he raped me and all but i guess theres all different kinds of rapes
i didnt exactly want him to do it but i suppose once it started it didnt seem all that terrible
it was over pretty quick and after uncle pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there
i stayed in bed till i heard him drive off
then i just went back into the kitchen and finished makin my sandwich
and you never told nobody about it
uncle pooch never acted strange or different after
and he never did anything else to me
i always got a nice present from him at christmas like a coat or jewelry
pause one hundred twenty decibels head on collision of a ford pick up and a chevy station wagon
balls of flame and grinding metal
uncle pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin in myrtle beach
they still got way too much traffic there for my taste
and another thing baby
that government of ours should be keepin us separated from outer space
here she goes again
sailor that ozone layer is disappearin
seems to me the government could do somethin about it
one of these mornings the sunll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an x ray
lula strikes a match and lights another cigarette
laughs that aint never will happen honey
least not in our lifetime
somewhere in the hotel a woman laughs
it is a kind of wild crazy laugh and for the few seconds it lasts lulas face goes pale
you okay honey
that womans laugh creeps me out
i heard somethin like that
soundd like the wicked witch
just sounded like an old gal havin a good time to me
you ready to dance
im always ready to dance
but i need me a kiss first honey
lula and sailor kiss
in the middle of the kiss the womans creepy crazy laugh is heard again in the distance and lulas eyes snap open with a kind of fear
marietta is escorting marcello santos and two stiff drinks to a table in her backyard
i knew youd want it again
thats not why i called
oh yeah sure
have it your way
but you want it
lulas gone off with sailor
what do you want me to do about it
i want you to take care of sailor so he wont ever be able to bother my baby again
take care of him
what does take care of him mean
do you want me to give him food or some clothing
whats with you
you know what take care of him means
i dont call santos except for one big reason
big is the key word and im telling you i want it bad
i want you to get rid of sailor
get rid of him
get rid of him
how would i do that
send him on a trip like maybe to hawaii
santos why in hell do you insist on playin this stupid game
just tell me what you want
i dont need to explain anymoren i have
you know damn well
you need to explain it
i want you
as simple as that
thats your business
i dont care how
like an accident where maybe lula might also get hurt
for gods sakes santos
well like kill him with the atomic bomb
i told you
like with a gun
in the leg
in the head
shoot sailor in the head with a gun
now im beginning to get it
you want me to shoot sailor in the head with a gun
but where in the head
not the chin i hope
in the brains
what little im sure he has
you want me to shoot sailor in the brains with a gun
through the forehead
its much better to blow a hole in the back of the head
right toward the bridge of the nose lots and lots of irreparable damage
i knew you had it all under control
why didnt you send johnnie farragut
maybe i did
try new orleans first
lula cant ever stop talkin bout that town
on one condition
he pauses and smiles strangely
you give me your permission to kill johnnie farragut
youre not tellin me that youre sweet on him
one day hes gonna find out what were up to with mr
reindeer and he could cause us a lot of trouble
they stare at each other for a moment
im gonna take your silence as a yes
its all right
also i either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed
you fucker dont you ever touch lula you fucker ill kill you
laughing put your shoulders back
put your shoulders back i said
marietta puts her shoulders back and santos comes and stands in front of her
you got nice tits
someones gonna see us
smiling as he starts to feel her breasts thats just another part of the price to pay
you kill that sailor otherwise hes gonna turn my baby against me
santos lifts one hand up to mariettas chin and raises her face up towards his
look at me
theres no turning back on this
im gonna kill sailor
thats for sure
we see the sign which has all the letters tipped way over to the right as if in a hurricane
two leaning palm trees border the sign
one hundred decibels of speed metal
we see the name powermad on the bass drum
the band segues into slaughter house and its a hot one
sailor grabs lula and they start dancing like two jacked up spastics in an electrical storm
a few punks actually stop dancing to watch sailor and lula
they thought theyd seen everything
cu of lula and sailor theyre in love and dancing hot
an idiot punk moves close to lula and rubs up against her as he dances by
sailor turns to the lead guitar player and signals him to stop the music immediately
suddenly everything is deathly quiet
sailor gives the man a fully extended reno point
are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl
or are you gonna save youself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her
dont fuck with me man
you look like a clown in that stupid jacket
this is a snakeskin jacket and for me its a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom
as he moves toward the idiot punk come here
the idiot punk tries to hit sailor but sailor slaps him so hard his knees almost bend backwards
the idiot punk goes down fighting back tears and holding his cheek
helping him up im sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd but i want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my
to lula im sorry
hell you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all
now go get yourself a beer
turning to the band you fellas have alotta the same power elvis had
yall know this one
sailor starts to sing an elvis presley song love me
as the band joins in with a perfect back up sailor sings to lula
the speed metal crowd is mesmerized
cu of pink the whole screen is filled with pink nylon
panning down we see lulas breasts which stand up and say hello
lula puts on her favorite pink shortie nightgown
why didnt ya sing love me tender
you told me that was your favorite love song
sailor turns around from his sprawled on the bed position watching the dating game show
cause im only gonna sing that song to my wife
lula makes a face
she lies down on the bed next to sailor
what you want to watch this trash for
aint one of those people have a real thought in their brain
keeping his gaze on the tv you want to tell me what if any real thoughts you had lately
what you have to get personal about so quick
all i mean is you could possibly read a book
whats that honey
we didnt have no tv up at pee dee baby you know
lula slides her head up and kisses sailor on the cheek
im sorry sweetie
i forget some moments where all you been the last two years
twenty three months eighteen days is all
dont need to make moren it was
referring to dating game show this couples goin on a date to hawaii
the girl chose him over the other two guys
dont the reject guys get anythin
gift certificates to kentucky fried chicken
that dont seem fair
hell why should the datin game be different from real life
at least them boys is gonna get somethin to eat
sailor and lula are in bed
lula lays in sailors arms
wouldnt it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives
laughing you think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes peanut
aint we been doin a pretty fair job this far
oh you know exactly what i mean honey
itd make the future so simple and nice
at pee dee all you think about is the future you know
and what youll do and what youll think about when youre on the outside again
i just think about things as they come up
i never been much of a planner
it aint altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes
lula i done a few things in my life i aint too proud of but ill tell ya from now on i aint gonna do nothin for no good reason
all i know for sure is theres moren a few bad ideas runnin around loose out there
ecu of match girding along the strike pad and bursting into flame
lula lights her cigarette
you know theres somethin i aint never told you about sailor and this heres a story with the lesson that theres a right time and a wrong time for things
when i was almost sixteen i got pregnant
sailor looks her in the eyes
musta been a lesson tellin ya it was the wrong time
what did you do your mama find out
nods she got me an abortion
ecu of dying fetus with one hundred twenty decibels lulas scream over
the fetus twitches in its little pod of blood
ecu of pulsing vein in lulas neck loud violent heartbeat sound like ecu of lulas forehead covered in sweat running down to her eyes open wide and wild
ecu of fetus into medical trash can
ecu of bloodied abortion instruments
the doctor leans across the abortion table
voice over from some old doctor with the hairiest nostrils and ears i ever seen
ecu of doctors nose and ears
voice over afterwards
we see marietta standing next to the doctor
voice over i hope you appreciate my spendin six hundred dollars not countin what it cost us to get here and back
this mans the best damn abortionist in the south
you tell the boy who knocked you up
it was my cousin dell done it
his folks used to visit with us summers
what happened to him
i never let on to mama about dell bein the one
i just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was
i didnt tell dell neither
he was back home in chattanooga by then anyhow and i didnt see the point
somethin terrible happened to him though
six months ago
whats that peanut
dell was learnin a hard lesson
what i learned from observin dell is i think people who are frightened want to disappear
hed startin behavin weird
like comin up to people every fifteen minutes and askin how they were doin
dell wearing a soiled double knit suit stops a lady in the street and smiling about the fact that earlier that morning hes placed a cockroach on his anus he
speaks to the woman
howre ya doin
and just seemin real spacey and actin funny
actin funny how
well like mama told me aunt rootie dells mama
she found cockroaches in dells underwear
cu of aunt rootie unfolds a pair of dirty jockey shorts and several cockroaches fall out
one time aunt rootie caught dell puttin one big cockroach on his anus
one time real late like about two thirty a
she found dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin sandwiches in the kitchen
in the dark kitchen aunt rootie finds dell making sandwiches slicing them on the diagonal
whatre ya doin
makin my lunch
voice over dell told her he was makin his lunch and goin to work
hes a welder
and she made him go back to bed
we see aunt rootie cross the kitchen take the knife away from dell and lead him out of the kitchen
then hed carry on about the weather
talk about how rainfalls controlled by aliens livin on earth
also how men wearin black leather gloves
dell crying uncontrollably is in the center of the room squatting like an indian in his jockey shorts
he has a long ruler stretched out in front of him which hes using to press down on the top of a lone black glove on the floor
voice over are followin him around
probly the rain boys from outer space
it aint so funny now though
december before christmas
dell disappeared again and aunt rootie hired a private eye to find him
he was missin for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin dressed in some filthy santa claus suit
dell walking to house
dell enters the front door in a santa claus suit so filthy you can hardly see the red through the black
he walks right past aunt rootie and goes back into the kitchen
there he immediately does a spread eagle on the floor and violently scratches his left ankle
voice over the private eye cost aunt rootie over a thousand dollars
then a little while later dell ran off a third time to some place he said would give him peace of mind
nobodys seen him since
sound like ol dells moren just a little confused peanut
too bad he couldnt visit that ol wizard of oz and get some good advice
too bad we all cant baby
one thing about dell
when he was about seventeen he startin losin his hair
hes twenty four now
a year older than you
and must be bout bald
theres worse things that can happen to a man honey
yeah i suppose
but you know somethin baby hair does make a difference
lula turns to study sailor
i sure am glad they didnt give you no prison haircut
sexual whisper gives me somethin to grab hold of while were makin love
they kiss passionately
sailor gets up from the bed and begins putting on his clothes
lula is painting her toenails red
lets go dancin peanut
we gotta be careful honey my mamas gonna have johnnie farragut on us like a duck on a june bug and hes one clever detective
you know how clever
he once told me that he could find an honest man in washington
my toenails gotta dry first anyways sailor
one thing puzzles my mind sugar
youre twenty years old arent you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin us apart
puttin a detective on us
ill tell ya lula
its moren me killin bob ray lemon
maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much
sailors eyes seem to be thinking back
we see an empty carpeted hallway and can hear a ballroom dance band playing in the distance
sailor obviously slightly drunk comes down the hall
he carefully almost losing his balance places his drink outside the mens room and enters
marietta standing down at the other end of the hall also drunk smiles and stares at the mens room door through her glazed eyes
sailor enters the mens room
sailor steps up to a urinal and starts doing his business
marietta suddenly appears drunk and laughing
she grabs him and pulls him into a stall closing and locking the door behind them
hey sailor boy you wanna fuck lulas mama
well she wants to fuck you
she starts trying to french kiss sailor when an old man comes in to urinate and sailor and marietta freeze in a kiss
sailor is going crazy in one way wishing this wasnt happening
marietta is going crazy in another
the man finishes and as he leaves
covering his eyes from seeing them lousy fuckin homosexuals
instantly pulling away from marietta what are you sick
im with lula
i just wanted to kiss you good bye
you know too much bout little lulas mom
well johnnie told me you used to drive for clyde and santos
so maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire
and youre gonna get burned baby
and besides that youre shit

why you belong right here in one of these toilets
youre gonna have to kill me to keep me away from lula

peanut im thinkin of breakin parole and takin you out to sunny california
you up for that
id got to the far end of the world for you baby
you know i would
those toenails dry yet
we got some dancin to do
we drift down lulas long white legs to her blood red toenails
cu of lulas dancing feet in black spiked heel sandals exposing blurred blood red toenails
lula and sailor are at it again dancing as if plugged in to the main power plant
drenched in sweat sailor and lula sit at a corner table chug a lugging rolling rock during the bands break
lula notices a girl in the corner eye balling sailor
she splits her attention between the girl and sailor
thats an awful long way to go just to get some pussy
yeah i had my first taste on that trip to juarez
at that age you still got a lot of energy
you still got plenty energy for me baby
lula has had enough of the girl staring at sailor
take a picture bitch
itll last longer
ill slap those eyes right outta your head
the girl gets up in a huff and leaves
whens the first time you done it with a girl who wasnt hookin
maybe two three months after juarez
i was visitin my cousin junior train in savannah and we were at some kids house whose parents were out of town
a girl comes up to me that was real tall taller than me
we see what he talks about
voice over she looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm told me her name was irma
whatd you say to her
told her my name
then she said somethin like its so noisy down here
why dont we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves
she turned around and led the way
i knew i had an important lesson to learn that day
we see what he talks about
voice over when she got almost to the top step i stuck my hand between her legs from behind
what a bad boy you are
laughing thats just what she said
i had a boner with a capital o
i went to kiss her but she broke off laughin and ran down the hallway
i found her lyin on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and penthouse magazines
she was a wild chick
she was wearin bright orange pants with kind of spanish lookin lacy black stripes down the sides
you know them kind that doesnt go all the way down your leg
you mean like pedal pushers
we see what he talks about
voice over she just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air
i slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it
youre excitin me honey
whatd she do
her face was half pushed into the pillow and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said i wont suck you
dont ask me to suck you
she dont know what she missed
what color hair she have

then she turns over peels off them orange pants and spreads her legs real wide and says to me
her smiling face take a bite of peach

ecu of match striking and bursting into flames
sailor is at the wheel of the dark blue thunderbird convertible

lula strips off the dishwater grey bedspread and tosses it over by the bureau
sailor looks out the broken window

johnnie farragut steers the buick down the dark highway past a sign which reads new orleans miles
sailor and lula are walking along the beach
lula takes off her shoes
sing song spells m i ss i ss i pp i
you can almost hear that jazz blowin up from the big n
i learned somethin interestin today on a science show i heard on the radio

you know when even barbers used em
shuddering i got one on me at lake lanier
lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off
he was a cute boy though so it was almost worth it
yeah well listen to this
radio said back in the s a i talian doctor figured out that if say a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in say a barfight or
somethin theyd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks
then put leeches on it
cu of man with forearm sewed to nose
you expect me to believe a mand be goin around with a arm sewed to his nose
nodding how they used to do it
course they got more sophisticated ways now
radio said the chinese i think it is figured a better idea is by insertin a balloon in the forehead and lettin it hand down on the nose
youre makin this shit up and i aint gonna sit for it
i probly aint precisely got all the facts straight but its about what they said
honey were goin to bed now and its time to change the subject
shes so cute sailor just has to kiss her
sailor and lula pass a sign that reads new orleans miles
sailor pulls off the road into a gulf gas station mini mart and stops the car next to a self serve pump
a sign on the top of it says please pay were about dry bones sweetheart
we dont wanna have to push this bird into new orleans
we sure dont honey
shouting to sailor as he goes into the store get me a mounds
a tall old black man about seventy years old wearing a torn green tulane tee shirt and a dirty orange saints baseball cap is filing items on the counter by
the cash register
in the pile are four ready made plastic wrapped sandwiches two tuna salad and two cotto salami six twinkies a package of chips ahoy chocolate chip cookies four slice colas
two barqs root beers and a large package of fried pork rinds extra salted
to sailor and another guy also waiting to pay for gas sorry gentlemen

then lemme throw in a couple more things
sailor and the man in line behind him watch as the black man gathers up several more packages of twinkies along with a few cupcakes and half a dozen cans
of pretty kitty cat food three liver and three chicken dinner portions and tosses them on his pile
to sailor smiling showing no visible upper teeth pussycats gotta eat too
he hands an american express card to the clerk erv who runs it through the verifier
the card checks out okay and the old guy prepares a charge slip has the man sign it and bags the purchases
to erv id just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one if its same to you
shoving the plastic bag he filled towards the black man we dont have no paper bags
a telephone begins to ring and everyone looks around
the black man reaches in his jacket pocket and pulls out a portable phone and punches send
into phone hello
yeah mama im on my way
to sailor and other guy as he picks up his bag and heads out thanks for waitin gentlemen
everyone is silent as they watch the old black man hobble out
to erv all i wants ten bucks regular
oh yeah and a mounds bar
erv takes one off the candy and gum rack next to the register and lays it on the counter
sailor gives him a twenty dollar bill
i aint got my american express card with me so i gotta use cash
hope thats okay
sailor smiles but the clerk keeps a poker face and just gives him his change
the guy in line behind sailor shakes his head and grins
sailor goes back to the car
that took long enough
you forget my mounds
sailor tosses her the candy bar
i really do think the country done changed just a little while i was away peanut
lula sinks her small white teeth into the chocolate covered coconut
as she chews you got to keep an eye on it
sailor starts pumping gas
cu of mail slot
two silver dollars comes through it and one falls head up and the other tails on the rug below
reindeer is just finishing dialing a number on the telephone
a coupla silver dollars came my way today
im sending one of them to you with a paper on the beneficiary as usual you are completely free to fulfill the obligation in any manner you so desire
he hangs up the phone and starts dialing another number
at a table near the window johnnie takes a man sized pull off his dixie beer in between bites of an oyster sandwich
a large chocolate colored man in his early thirties reginald san pedro sula and a smaller white man drop shadow approach with their trays of food
do you mind if we share this table
the others they are occupied
johnnie looks around sees that there are quite a few empty tables he looks the men over quickly
by all means
make yourselves at home
as he sits down muchas gracias
my name is reginald san pedro sula
but please do call me reggie
this is my friend who we call drop shadow
he is always with me
johnnie wipes off his right hand on his napkin and shakes
pleased to meet ya
reggie and drop shadow begin eating ferociously finishing half of their meal before saying anything more
you are from new orleans senor farragut
charlotte north carolina
here on business
reggie smiles broadly revealing numerous tall gold teeth
san pedro sula is from honduras
do you know honduras johnny
only that its supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year
yes thats so
but there is not much to destroy
no big buildings like in new orleans
whattaya do there
laughs oh many things
san pedro sulas got an appliance shop
but i am also with the government
johnnie takes a bite of his oyster sandwich
in what capacity
in many capacities
san pedro sula is with the secret service
reggie reaches into his back pocket and takes out his wallet
he hands a card to johnnie
reading aloud general osvaldo tamarindo y ramirez
he is my sponsor
the general is the head of the secret police of honduras
san pedro sula is one of his operatives
johnnie hands the card back to reggie and reggie gives him a small piece of paper folded once
johnnie unfolds it
the printing is in spanish
that is my permiso
san pedro sulas permit to kill
only if necessary of course and only in my own country
laughs of course
johnnie refolds the piece of paper and hands it over to reggie
san pedro sulas authorized to carry a
united states marine issue before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters
i have it here in my briefcase
reggie holds up his stainless steel briefcase and then replaces it on the floor beneath his chair
why are you in new orleans
if you dont mind my askin
we are here only briefly in fact until this evening when we fly to austin texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the cia
he wants to take mr
san pedro sula and me bass fishing
we are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen
johnnie swallows the last of his beer and stands up to leave
extending his hand its been a real pleasure
i wish you both buena suerte wherever you go
reggie and drop shadow stand up
they shake johnnies hand
the same to you
if you are in honduras come to the bay islands and visit us
the hondurans are great friends of the american people
but i have a joke for you before i go
if a liberal a socialist and a communist all jumped off the roof of the empire state building at the same time which one of them would hit the ground
i couldnt say which one
reggie turns to drop shadow and lets him have the punch line
grinning who cares
sailor and lula are just finishing making love in their room
as lula climaxes her left hand opens and spreads wide
the lay quietly for a moment
i love it when your eyes get wild honey
they light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of em
oh sailor youre so aware of what goes on with me
i mean you pay attention
and i swear you got the sweetest cock
sometimes its like its talkin to me when youre inside
like its got a voice all its own
you get right on me
you really are dangerously cute honey
i gotta admit it
lula lights a cigarette
lets head out into the crazy world of new orleans
i gotta get somethin to eat
sailor and lula sit at the counter drinking double sized cups of community coffee
a man on the stool next to sailor lights up a rum soaked crook
my names george kovich
bet youve heard of me
dont know that i have
should i know about you for anythin in particular
was in all the papers three years ago
im seventy six was only seventy three then
had a business in buffalo new york called rats with wings
killed pigeons for anyone who wanted em killed
why were you killin pigeons mr
were you in the extermination business
i was a housepainter in the union forty one years
im retired now livin with my sister ida
ida moved down here twenty five years ago married an oil man named smoltz ed smoltz
hes dead now so its just me and ida
i sold my house and moved down after the city of buffalo put me out of business
hell rww was doin them a service and they charged me with endangerin the public
whats wrong with pigeons mr
theyre useless pests
ive shot hundreds of em
george is shooting pigeons as fast as he can
voice over my neighbors hired me to get rid of the pigeons that gathered on their roofs and porches
neighbors asked me how come the spotted bastards didnt light on my house or my brother earls anymore and i told em the truth
i shot em
earls gone now
earl pitches forward out of his easy chair and hits the carpet hard screaming in pain
voice over heart attack six months ago had that cholesterol thick as shit
his widow mildred she still lives in the house next to mine
shes stone deaf but the racket the pigeons made drove earl crazy
he could hear em even with the tv on
he owned a bar thirty years the boilermaker on wyoming street
earls roof was a favorite spot for pigeons
they lit there day and night
i wanted to toss a grenade up there
if your neighbors didnt mind howd you get put out of business
woman drivin down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle
she called the police and they came over and arrested me
thought i was a sniper
boys at the vfw loved that one
cops didnt understand about the pigeons the damage they do to personal property
i used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger
i was gonna put out poison but i was afraid somebodys cat would eat it
hell i had six cats myself
so i used the
because it didnt make much noise and the ammo was cheap
what happened on the charges
guilty on a reduced charge
hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist
pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place
you seen it
kovich stands up and puts some money on the counter
its a serious situation
not like the turks and the armenians maybe or the arabs and the jews but i want people to remember me and what ive done and pick up where i
somebody had to make a move
it was nice meetin you folks
george kovich nods and leaves
what lesson do get outta that story lula
its just another case sailor
whats that peanut
one person thinks hes doin somethin good and everbody else gets upset about it
sailor looks up at lula
aint it the way
its very quiet in the hotel room and the clock says four a
lula and sailor are lying in bed arm in arm
sailor is fast asleep snoring
lula is wide awake
sailor snaps awake with a snort
ever imagine what itd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast
sometimes i think it would be the biggest thrill
my god looks around it better be darlin cause itd be the last
what time is it
its four oclock
that womans laugh the other day had somethin to do with this feelin
like bein ripped apart by a gorilla maybe
grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one
lulas left hand opens and spreads wide
lula sometimes i gotta admit you come up with some weird thoughts
anythin interestin in the world come out of somebodys weird thoughts sailor
you tell me sailor who could come up with shit like were seein these days
you got me peanut
smiles turns to him you certain
i aint never met anyone come close to you sugar

get used to it cause it belongs to you now
dyou recall that
i was hopin you would
i know that night by heart
i think its the best night of my life
tight two shot lula and sailor with their arms around each other cheek to cheek talking softly
a strange presence begins to build and a piece of sad nostalgic music plays
lost in the memory i really do think its the best night of my life
we didnt do nothin special i can remember
just talked is all
long as you got the other
im a big believer in talkin case you aint noticed
too bad they dont give an award for talkin
youd win first prize
especially with those tits
you think so baby
does my talkin bother you honey
no i like gettin up around four a
and talkin bout wild animals though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream
i kinda wish i didnt remember it
up at pee dee i couldnt remember any of my dreams
what was this one
it wasnt no fun lula
the wind was blowin super hard and i wasnt dressed warm
only instead of freezin i was sweatin strong

cu of eyes
black sweat is rolling down the forehead and over the eyes
voice over i tell you lula

lula puts her arms around him
sometimes dreams just dont mean nothin
stuff comes into your mind and you dont have no control over you know
anyways dreams aint no odder than real life
sometimes not by half
well i aint upset about it darlin
just give me an odd feelin there a minute is all
lula lifts her head and kisses sailor under his left ear
she rolls over on top of sailor
take a bite of lula
johnnie farragut sits down on a stool at the bar
chet the bartender approaches

but like you said everythins realtive
lula waits just by the lobby door of the hotel
in the back of the lobby in the shadows is an ancient old black man who stares at her
sailor pulls the t bird up in front of the hotel and lula hurries out to him and tosses their suitcase in the backseat
lets get outta here
i suddenly got a funny feelin about this place
feelin all that voodoo
winks at her gotta hex from a voodoo
smiles who do
they laugh and take off around the corner and up past the cafe du monde
oh my god
looking around frantically where
never mind where
get outta here
i mean it sailor
sailor pulls the car up fast and hangs a right turn
johnnie smiles as he watches sailor and lula turn the corner
to himself aint love wonderful
i said aint love wonderful
johnnie raises his cup of coffee to sailor and lula who have long since disappeared
good luck to you kids
sailor and lula drive
you think he saw us
who knows baby
he was sittin there havin a beignet at the cafe du monde
do you think he saw us
makes no difference anyway
were outta here
we watch the car disappear up the street
slowly the camera pans and reggie and drop shadow come walking happily along the sidewalk whistling
lula and sailor are motoring along
sweetheart keep your panties up
were in jimmy swaggart country
sailor and lula both laugh
up ahead sailor spots a hitchhiker
he slows to pick him up
sure you wanna do this
might be a way they could track us
hes just a regular guyt needs help honey
look at him
the hitchhiker is a man about thirty with a pack on his back and he is carrying a large covered cardboard box
he is filthy with an uneven smile that exposes his jagged yellow teeth
lula opens the door for him and after he loads his stuff sailor takes off down the highway
thanks a lot
i been standin out there off and on for two hours ha ha
since noon about ha ha
cops catch ya hitchin on a interstate around here they throw ya on a county road crew for a week less you can pay the ticket ha ha
which i aint got ha ha

but everbody calls me roach ha ha
roach deloach ha ha
you always make that strange little funny laugh when you talk
aint laughin ha ha
what you got in the box
my dogs ha ha
roach slides the top off and tilts the box slightly toward the front
inside are six small husky pups that are not more than two weeks old
im headed to alaska ha ha
these dogs is gonna be my sled team ha ha
to sailor this guys crazy
where you from roach
if you mean where i was born it was belzoni missippi ha ha
but i been brought up in baton rouge
why you goin to alaska
and whered you get them puppies
they look sick
roach stares down into the box at the baby huskies and strokes each of them twice with a religiously unwashed hand
the dogs whimper and lick his dirty fingers
i saw this movie on tv ha ha
the call of the wild
i aint never seen snow ha ha
i got these dogs at the pound
nobody wanted em ha ha
everbody here got theirself pit bulls or some kinda hounds
im gonna feed these boys good so theyll be big and powerful and they can pull me real fast through the snow ha ha
roach pulls a piece of raw cows liver out of one of his pockets of his field jacket and begins ripping little bits off it and feeding them to the
screeches as she sees this sailor
stop the car now
sailor pulls off the road onto the shoulder of the highway and stops
lula opens her door and jumps out
im sorry but i cant take this
roach or whatever your name is you come out of there with them dogs this instant
roach sticks the liver back in his pocket and pulls his pack and the box of tiny canines after him
once he and his belongings are deposited on the roadside lula hops back in the car and slams the door
im truly sorry
im truly sorry roach
but aint gonna make it to alaska
least not any part of the way with us
youd best find a party to take care of those dogs proper before they all die
and if you dont mind my sayin so
you could most certainly use some serious lookin after yourself startin with a bath
lula takes a pair of sunglasses off the dashboard and puts them on
sailor takes off
you dont feel you was a little hard on the guy honey
i know youre thinkin that i got moren some of my mama in me
well i couldnt help it
sailor i really couldnt
im sorry for that guy but when he pulled that drippin hunk of awful smellin meat out of his pocket
i near barfed
and them poor diseased puppies
laughs just part of life on the road peanut
do me a favor sailor
dont pick up no more hitchers okay
johnnie is seated in a telephone booth at the back of the bar
no marietta i havent found em
this is the kinda mistake can take a hindus lifetime to unfix
you better get a move on johnnie before that boy got her holdin down a memphis streetcorner and shootin dope up her arms
we see reggie and drop shadow enter the bar
reggies unsmiling eyes drift across the room until they see johnnie in the booth
he stares coldly and waits
drop shadow adjusts his socks
really marietta you got more scenarios swimmin around in your brain than carter got pills
try to take it easy
go over to myrtle beach for a few days
im stayin right here by the phone until you find lula then im comin to get her
you call soons you got somethin even if its three in the a
i will marietta
johnnie hangs up the phone and exits the booth
as he crosses the bar
we meet again
johnnie goes over to reggie and drop shadow and shakes hands
i thought you two were in austin texas
or takes us as they say in these parts
san pedro sula and i are on our way back to utila in the morning
would you like to enjoy a martini with us
how was the fishin
i think they are too serious these american fishermen
in honduras we are not so concerned with the method
reggie orders martinis for the three of them
so its back to the islands
san pedro sula spoke yesterday to his son archibald leach san pedro sula who is named after cary grant and he told them there was a shooting
teddy roosevelt one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now
these people are friends of mine so i must return and find out what happened
this island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place
laughs it has its moments of uncertainty
but how are you finding new orleans senor farragut
call me johnnie
has always been a good town to sit around in
i can tell you are an intelligent man johnnie
one difference between your country and mine is that in the islands it does not pay to reveal ones intelligence
others may use what they perceive against us
reggie raises his glass to johnnies
do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in scotland
two scotsmen were fighting over a penny
johnnie finishes off his martini
i gotta admit you guys are sliding off the stool two in four dozen
the real joke is we never went fishing but were still fishing
johnnie squints his eyes thinking about this one
reggie and drop shadow smile and stand to leave
lula and sailor cruise the dark streets
i wouldnt mind a little night life
how about you
hard to tell whats shakin in a place like this honey
you dont want to be walkin in the wrong door
maybe theres a place we could hear some music
i feel like dancin
we could ask someone
sailor spots a red devil gas station that still has its lights on and pulls the car over
someone up here might know somethin
two skinny pimply faced guys buck and billy wearing dirty coveralls walk over to them
got enough thanks
were lookin for a place has some music where we can maybe do some dancin get somethin to eat too
anything like that around here
they got western
no food though cept bar nibbles
lula slides over in the front seat and leans across to sailor
how about speed metal
the kids look worried and take a step back
any kinda rocknroll honey
theres a boogie joint just about a mile straight out lafitte here
but thats a black place mostly
mostly black though in that boogie place
whats the name of it
you say its straight ahead a mile
where lafitte crosses over galvez highway
sailor and lula drive off
buck and billy go back inside the red devil station
guess who is over the corner cleaning nuts and bolts with a toothbrush and gasoline
the club zanzibar sits in the darkness on the left hand side of the road
a string of multi colored lights is hung over the front
sailor parks the thunderbird across from the club and cuts the engine
you ready for this
well find out in a hurry
when they walk in the band is playing a slow blues and three or four couples are swaying on the dance floor
there are a dozen tables and a long bar in the room which is done up in a strange dark azquatic motif
eight of the tables are occupied and six or seven men stand at the bar
everyone in the place is black except for one white woman who is sitting alone at a table smoking a cigarette and drinking pearl straight from the bottle
the atmosphere is not friendly but lula takes sailor by the arm
they step up to the bar and order two lone star beers
the bartender a tall heavyset man slowly forms his hand into the bird
he holds his hand that way while he speaks
this is a friendly place son
you folks just relax and have a nice time
bound and determined not to be intimidated you got yourself a deal
to sailor thats a real jacket
by that i mean a real stupid jacket
this is a snakeskin jacket and for me it represents a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom
fuckin honky cracker mumbo jumbo
the bartender moves on down the bar
lula and sailor take a small table near the door
ill be damned if im leavin
that band is too good
you notice that woman when we come in
the white woman sittin by herself
well she aint talked to nobody and aint nobody spoke to her that i could tell
what you make of that
honey we bein strangers here and all this is the kinda place we dont want to make nothin of nothin
you think shes pretty
sailor looks at the woman
she lights a new cigarette off a butt then squashes the butt in the ashtray
she is thirty years old maybe more
shoulder length bleached blonde hair black at the roots
clear skin green eyes
long straight nose with a small bump on it
she is wearing a low cut lavender dress that would have emphasized her breasts had she not been so flat chested
i tend to like em with a little more meat on the bones
face aint bad though
lula gets quiet and sucks on her beer bottle
whats wrong sweetheart

i been thinkin about her
shes probly worried to death by now
i want to call her and tell her im okay

to bartender pardon me

she kisses him on the nose and walks back through a dark little door to the payphone
marietta answers the telephone on the second ring

lula hangs up
marietta hangs up and begins pacing the livingroom floor
sailor and the bleached blonde in the lavender dress are together on the dance floor
lula sees them goes over to the bar picks up a beer bottle and throws it at sailor
the bottle bounces hard off his back and clangs to the floor bouncing but not breaking
sailor turns around fast and looks at lula
everybody else in the place is still
lula runs out
sailor finds her sitting on the ground leaning against the passenger side of the thunderbird
lulas eyes are red and wet but she isnt crying
sailor kneels down next to her
i was just wastin time peanut till you come back
its me whos wastin time sailor bein with you

sailor kisses her and climbs into the back seat and lays down
lula slides behind the wheel and lights up a more
she winks goodbye to the old man and wheels the car out towards the big beyond
the reception gets bad on the big band tune and lula starts turning the dial
up comes a nationwide call in talk show and she leaves it there

lula takes a puff of her more and tosses it out the window and starts turning the radio dial finds a news station
live in exchange for sexual favors
police said they have identified and questioned at least four girls all asians twelve to fifteen years old who have been living in the north houston warehouse with a vietnamese
pimp since february

these are really just children he said but theyve been exposed to a lot already
lights another cigarette ill bet
in international news india plans to release crocodiles in the ganges the holy hindu river in which millions of people bathe annually to scavenge for corpses authorities said
a crocodile suddenly breaks the surface of the water with a rotted human corpse clutched in its mighty jaws
voice over the reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species said a senior government official but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles
the indian official who supplied this information did so only on condition of anonymity
the uttar pradesh state authorities last october released five hundred turtles
a giant turtle breaks the surface of the water clutching a rotted human corpse in its mighty jaws
voice over in the ganges near varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin corpses dumped by hindus too poor
to pay for cremation
sailor jumps awake in fright as lula yanks the car off the road and brings it to a screeching halt in the middle of the desert
whats that peanut

sailor starts spinning the dial
still crazed the worlds gettin worse i think sailor
and it dont sound like theres much we can do about it neither
this aint news sweetheart

suddenly sailor finds a station the station and he and lula look at each other in disbelief
sailor turns it up full blast and he and lula dance hard until they disappear in the dust
marietta and johnnie are standing at the registration desk talking to the hotel manager
heres your key
farraguts already taken care of everything
i hope youll be comfortable mrs
youre in room right down the hall from mr
the desk clerk steps in from a room behind the registration desk
i have a phone call for you mrs
at the phone by the fireplace

marietta looks at johnnie
she goes to the phone and picks it up when it rings
marcello santos sits on the edge of his bed holding the telephone
i got your message

i cant trust you bitch not for one minute
sailor and lula are headed west and guess what

he hangs up the phone
johnnie enters as marietta hangs up the phone covering her fear
who was that

ill be damned if that wasnt a wrong number
upstairs in a private dining room mr
reindeer is dining with twelve guests in formal evening attire
behind him a jazz trio and a striptease artist are hard at work
reindeer smiles and leans over very close to a beautiful woman sitting to his left
little miss muffet sat on a tuffet eating her curds and whey
along came a spider and sat down beside her and extended his hand out to play
with this he reaches under the table between her legs
she turns red and mr
reindeer laughs and lights a cigarette
another miss dull cunt
reggie and drop shadow enter through a door on the other side of the room
reggie catches mr
reindeers eye and smiles
reggie reaches in his pocket and takes out a silver dollar flips it in the air catches it and puts it back in his pocket
reindeer smiles and waves him over to the table
he whispers something in reggies ear then gives him an envelope
when i gave you the silver dollar i forgot to give you the contents of this envelope
they are to be returned
show it just before the deed
reggie pockets the envelope joins drop shadow and as they are leaving the dining room they join a woman juana who looks half oriental half cajun
she wears a strange short yellowish bleached blonde wig
they go downstairs together
at the bottom of the stairs reggie and drop shadow catch sight of johnnie who is sitting in the back of the restaurant having dinner with marietta
when johnnie sees the two of them he waves but at the same time gets a chill up his spine
what is it johnnie
just some guys i met here

marietta continues to stare at reggie drop shadow and juana before turning back to johnnie
she also feels the fear

as she enters her room ill pack my things and meet you downstairs
and to think what coulda happened in that king sized bed tonight
pinching his cheek you wont of missed much

johnnie smiles and heads up to his room
he opens the door and steps inside
johnnie is knocked in the head with a heavy metal pipe and he goes down hard
a large dark figure grabs on to him and pulls him to an open window and lowers him into the back of a pick up
the dark figure follows out the window
marietta is sitting in the lobby trying to hold herself together half sobbing
the manager approaches and sits next to her
im afraid his car is gone mrs
i dont understand this
i dont understand this one bit
he was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby
somethin bad has happened i jus know it
perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer
thats the last thing we need
a buncha cops runnin around
the front desk clerk steps from behind his desk and hurries into the lobby
but i have overlooked this

he hands marietta a note inside an envelope which she opens and reads immediately
we see the note

and jus when my babys out on some texas road with a killer
the front door of the hotel opens and in walks santos
he seems to know exactly where marietta is and steps to the door of the sitting room off the lobby
he stands in the doorway and smiles at marietta
horrified whisper santos

the manager and desk clerk bow to marietta and santos and go back through the lobby

light comes from one small dirty window
johnnie is tied to a small wooden straight backed chair
his mouth is gagged and taped shut
his hair is caked with dry blood and one fresh tickle curls down his forehead to his eyes which are just now beginning to open and focus
juana is finishing tying his left ankle to the chair leg

the opposite wall and bottles get covered with blood
juana and reggie race into each others arms and kiss right above johnnies dead bloodied head
lula and sailor are driving through the dark desert

i been carryin a secret too
the livingroom is on fire
the livingroom is on fire and we move upstairs lula races through the smoke filled hallway to her mothers bedroom
the livingroom is on fire and lula throws open the door to her mothers bedroom just in time to see marcello santos leaving through a window
her mother laughs a wild crazy laugh exactly the same laugh lula heard on the porch of the cape fear hotel
voice over that night in the fire while my daddy was dyin
i saw mama up in her room with santos
they was laughin arm in arm like animals
i didnt want to say it
but i had a feelin santos was up to somethin with your mama
quietly my mama
after a pause she smiles so sailor our histories have been somewhat intertwined
they have sugar
i take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together
its a comfortin idea
well were really out in the middle of it now aint we
theres worse places honey
if you say so
trust me on it
turns to him i do trust you sailor
like i aint never trusted nobody before
after a moment well be alright peanut long as weve got room to move
looking into the highway whats that
i dont know
looks like clothes
sailor starts to slow down
the highway is suddenly littered with clothes strewn everywhere and two open suitcases smashed near the side of the road
sailor slows down to a crawl
he and lula turn to each other theyve just seen two dead bodies
one close to the side of the highway and other just off in the desert brush
off behind is an overturned car
oh god sailor
one bad car accident
coming out of the darkness is a young girl her clothes half torn off blood draining out of several deep wounds
sailor what are we gonna do
i dont know honey but we gotta help that girl get her to a town and hope no one catches on i broke parole
they get out of the car and the girl comes toward them screaming
completely gone in shock ive got about five hundred dollars in my wallet and i cant find it
my mothers going to kill me

the girl starts walking back toward the car

sailor reaches out cautiously and takes hold of the girls arm
shit i got this damn sticky stuff in my hair
she keeps digging her fingers into a bloody wound in her head
gotta find my wallet
to sailor dont you say one word of this to my mother
god shes gonna kill me
the girls falls to one knee and struggles to get back up
sailor and lula each take an arm and try to help her
sailor and lula help the girl stand but her eyes start rolling back and a bunch of fresh blood comes gushing up out of her mouth
i cant take this sailor
shes dyin right in front of our eyes
im afraid she is baby
sailor kneels down next to the girl and runs his hand gently across her forehead
wide eyed now get my lipstick
whisper its in my purse
the girl dies
sailor and lula hold real still for a moment
lula starts to cry
she died right in front of me
whyd she have to go and do that sailor
lets get outta here honey
before getting up sailor lets his hand come off the girls forehead down over her eyes closing them
he puts his hand on her cheek then gets up
he puts his arm around lula and they go back to her car
sailor helps lula in on her side and closes the door for her
he goes around gets in and looks over at lula who breaks down crying harder
sailor starts the car and takes off
the thunderbird drives past a large stucco fish on a rock stand which has a sign on it that says big tuna texas
sailor cruises the t bird along the main street of big tuna eye balling the place
well it aint exactly emerald city
not quite as bad as the weather though
it must be a hundred and ten and it aint even noon yet
sailor pulls the car up in front of the iguana motel
the room is simple double bed dresser mirror chair sink toilet bathtub no shower electric fan window overlooking the street
not bad for eleven dollars a day
no radio or tv
she strips off the spread tosses it in a corner and sits down on the bed
and no ac
lets get a sandwich and find out about some work
this aint exactly my most thrillin notion of startin a new life
they stare at each other
lula suddenly feels sick to her stomach and slumps down on the edge of the bed
im gonna stay here in this room sailor
i dont feel so good
this heat makes me tired
okay honey ill see you later
a tall skinny man red in his early thirties with wild uncombed hair the color of pomegranate walks out of the garage
with a smile well i aint blackie
sailor holds out his right hand to shake
names sailor ripley
katy over at the drugstore thought you might have some work i could do

the temperature on the tower reads one hundred twelve
in front of the door there is a large damp spot on the rug where about a hundred and fifty flies are buzzing and landing
sailor sees this when he opens the door
he steps across the large spot and finds lula just waking up on the bed

lula opens her eyes and looks at him

sailor strokes lulas head

lula closes her eyes

the darkening evening sky is filled with flying monkeys
sailor lula sparky and buddy are sitting in the courtyard of the motel sharing sparkys fifth of ezra brooks
an electric bug killer is working overtime
buddy is reading from a newspaper
reading from paper robert brenton twenty five was killed when his car went off the road on state highway according to the department of public safety

bobby looks down at his hand flexs it
bobby was at cao ben

bobby returns from the jukebox and sits down next to sailor
q three times
pee wee kings waltz of regret my favorite tune
pee wees steel guitar ripples through the cigarette haze and buzzes around sailors head
his reflection wobbles in the long mirror behind the bar

bobby looks around in the purple twilight before he opens the trunk of the eldorado
he peels back a brown army blanket
thats a double barreled sawed off ithaca shotgun with a carved pistol grip stock wrapped with adhesive tape
next to its a cold smith and wesson handgun with a six inch barrel

lula puffs hard on her cigarette

sailor turns on his side away from lula and pulls a pillow over his head
that mans a black angel sailor
you hook up with him youll regret it
if you live to
thanks darlin i know you got my best interest in mind and i preciate it sincerely
i love you but i gotta sleep now
lula lights a second more off the first one and stubs out the butt on the dresser top
this whole worlds wild at heart and weird on top
lula turns over away from sailor
softly i wish you really truly loved me
i wish youd sing me love me tender i wish i was somewhere over that rainbow
shit shit shit
cu of sailors eyes he remembers
sailor and lula are walking down the carpeted stairs when sailor is called by bob ray lemon who is coming down towards them fast
marietta stands at the top watching
wait a minute
i got somethin for ya
as bob ray passes lula on the stairs he puts his hand between her legs
sailor starts to see red
bob ray smiles and steps down to sailor
he leans in and whispers in sailors ear
marietta says you been tryin to fuck her in the toilets for the past ten minutes
you crazy fuckin bad boy tryin to fuck your girls mama
how do you think that cute little cunt lula would feel about that
hey take a look at this
shows sailor one thousand dollars in cash marietta just gave me this to kill you right now and afterward she said lula was mine to fuck all the way into
bob ray pulls a knife but sailors fist is already halfway through bob rays brain
from there sailor steps firmly into the crazy zone
amidst blood curdling hysterical screams from a growing throng of southern belles sailor starts taking bob ray apart limb by limb and doesnt stop until bob ray lays completely destroyed
and completely dead at the foot of the stairs
the crowd of formally dressed onlookers stand aghast
sailor stares up at marietta
both their eyes burning with hate
sailor is dripping with sweat
his teeth are clenched tight and his fists violently grip the sheets as if any minute he could tear the bed apart
bobby lets the screen door bang shut behind him as he comes in and roams around the livingroom
nice of you to drop by
told ya i would
you still riled
laughs you still screwing sixteen year olds in the ass
bobby keeps circling
aint never had no girl pull a blade on me
wish id fuckin cut you up good
you heard from reggie
theyre stayin another week
bobby stops walking and stares at the photograph on the wall
stayin a few extra days in the big n
perdita turns her head and looks then turns back
we see the photo now
in it are perdita along with her sister juana and her husband reggie whom we recognize as the killers of johnnie
dont look like you
bobby turns around and leans down and puts his face next to perditas from behind
the cobras waitin to strike chica
that guy sailor came around this afternoon
asked me if there was a contract out on im
laughs out loud no shit
you know him
whatd you say
no of course
bobby takes out a silver dollar and flips it into the air
it lands tails up in his hand
he pockets it
could have a bad accident though
or after a hold up
whats gonna happen when he sees me drivin the car tomorrow
maybe hell get a little nervous but who gives a shit
bobby lowers his hands into the front of perditas blouse and cups her breasts
she burns the back of his left wrist with her cigarette
bobby jumps back then grabs perditas hair and pulls her over the couch onto the floor
neither of them speak
she tries to stand but bobby keeps his right foot on her chest while he blows the back of his wounded wrist
perdita shoves his leg to one side and rolls away
she stand up and spits at him
grinning i knew we could be friends again
lula lays very still on the bed
her head is close to the small turquoise radio on the bedside table
she is listening to a piece of sad nostalgic music and as we move in closer to her and the radio the volume increases
lula remembers some moments in her life with sailor music continues over when he kissed her outside the jail gate
when he touched her breast the day after he got out of jail
when they sat behind the confederate soldier
when they danced to slaughter house
suddenly lula sees an image in her mind that she does not recognize
she sees an abstract image of reflected light with two eyes looking through it at her
the image puzzles her
the music continues over the big eldorado pulls up in front of the iguana motel where sailor has been waiting in the hot sun
bobby opens the door
jump in back
sailor crawls in the back seat and sees perdita just as she floors it and they take off in a cloud of dust
whats she doin here
shes my girl
that bother you
why should it
take one of these
what is it
work bettern stockins
pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head
you get the pistol
hands him the
remember soon as we get inside you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it
once they notice the ithaca and the smith theyll know we aint foolin with em
comin up on it now bobby
bobby slips the panty hose over his head and adjusts it
his face looks crooked and distorted
frightening whisper come on
get that mask on
sailor rips open the package and pulls a nylon leg over his head stretching the calf part to fit
perdita pulls up in front of the store
the street is deserted
keep it revved chiquita
we wont be long
just goin in to get our five grand
bobby and sailor enter the feed store
bobby raises his sawed off shotgun and points it at the two old men behind the counter
into the back room both of you bobby and the two men head down the hall into the back room
calling back to sailor if anyone comes in herd em back here quick
suddenly an iguana county deputy sheriff cruises up in a patrol car and parks it on angle in front of the idling eldo
the deputy gets out of his car and walks over to the drivers side of the eldorado
waitin for somebody miss
hes in the feed store picking up some supplies
youd best be careful of that cigarette maam
its about to burn down between your fingers
perdita stubs out her marlboro in the ashtray
the two old guys have their hands in the air and are moving back behind the counter
bobby is just finishing tying off a bag of money
sailor is by the front door holding his pistol on the two old guys
when bobby finishes tying the money bag he lifts the shotgun and blows a hole through the chest of one of the old men
sailor goes into shock
reacting to the shot perdita jams the gear shift into reverse and peels out knocking the deputy down
sailor turns his pistol on bobby now
bobby spins his shotgun around and points it at sailor
youre next fucker
the second old man is reaching under the counter
sailor fires his
there are no live bullets in his pistol
it just makes a dry click
bobby smiles and is just about to kill sailor when out of the corner of his eye he catches sight of the second old man bringing out a big shotgun
of his own
bobby instinctively spins and empties the second barrel of his two barrel shotgun into the old gentleman
as bobby is reloading fast sailor sprints through the front door
bobby is right behind him as he flys out the front door
the deputy recovers and comes up on one knee with his revolver clasped in both hands
he fires his first shot into bobbys thigh and his second into bobbys left hip
the shock of the initial slug causes bobby to drop the bag
the impact of the second forces bobbys right hand to twist sideways to that both barrels of the shotgun wedge under his chin
the ithaca goes off blowing bobby backwards through the ramos on the plate glass window of the feed store
sailor hits the ground losing the smith as he falls
he puts his hand over his hosieried head and keeps his face in the dirt until the deputy orders him to stand up
lula is sitting on a bench in the waiting room of the iguana county courthouse building when marietta and santos walk in
as soon as she sees lula marietta runs over sits down next to her and hugs and kisses her
oh baby i was beginnin to think i was never gonna see you again
tears are pouring down mariettas cheeks
she holds lula to her and lula does not resist
lula just stares at santos
youre comin home precious
santos gonna drive us to the san antonio airport
mama sailors in deep trouble here
i just cant leave him
marietta takes lula by the shoulders and looks straight at her
lulas eyes are bloodshot her hair is greasy and stringy and her cheeks are pale
oh yes you can
santos steps forward
lula begins to tremble
your mamas been real worried bout you honey
can you give your old friend santos a hug too
santos arms begin to go around lula
lula lets out a blood curdling scream and shakes like a leaf on a tree
santos grabs her hard in a bear hug
on one shirt cuff we see a cufflink which is turquoise orange and silver
sailor lays on his jail bed reading a letter from lula
voice over dearest sailor darling the first thing youll want to know is im keeping the baby
mama wasnt for it in the beginning but i think shes looking forward to it
im gonna name it pace no matter if its a boy or a girl
pace ripley sounds good dont it

i feel like im kind of in prison too but i know in six months itll be over and ill have a son or daughter to show for it
i love you sailor
i dont know how much or what it means though i miss you an awful bunch sometimes i know youre thinking about me cause i can feel it

johnnie farragut has plumb disappeared

lula sits in her bedroom reading a letter from sailor
voice over dear lula it is fine with me about the baby as you already know
and pace being your family name and all is just right
what about a middle name if it is a boy after my granddaddy roscoe
he would be proud i know though he is long passed

it is hard to end this letter

vava con dios mi amor
sailor six years later
lula stands in the living room holding a glass of ice water while talking on the telephone to her mother
marietta is wearing a giant diamond ring on one hand and the other hand is holding a martini and rossi sweet vermouth
marietta is slumped over in an ottoman with wheels and is pushing her drunken self around the livingroom as she talks on the phone
im goin mama

sighs what times sailors train get in

what if i asked you not to

what if i told you not to
if you get in the way of me and sailors happiness ill fuckin pull your arms out by the roots
lula hangs up and throws her glass of water at a picture of her mother draining it
pace roscoe fortune is a shy polite innocent six year old who wears a long billed fishing cap and pants with suspenders
howll we know what he looks like
lula makes a wide left turn onto jeff davis highway without signaling causing the driver of a white bonneville headed across the intersection to jam on his brakes in order
to avoid a collision
the bonneville driver sits on his horn and shouts at lula
mama you almost crashed us
lula steadies the steering wheel of her camaro with her left elbow while she strikes a match and lights up a more
she throws the match out the window and takes possession of the wheel with both hands the cigarette is clamped in her teeth
dont give me no trouble now pace please
this aint the easiest day in a long time
and what do you mean how are we gonna know what your daddy looks like
you seen his photo
howll he know what we look like

lula puffs furiously several times on her more before she takes it out of her mouth and drops it
damn it child
now look what you made me do
what i made you do mama
lula feels around on the floor with one hand until she finds the cigarette
sirens can be heard up ahead
stubbing it out in the ashtray mamas just actin strange
you aint actin mama
why pace roscoe ripley aint you got one cute mouth tonight
they pass an automobile accident where a man has been thrown into the curb his head broken open and bleeding
the ambulance is just arriving
lula looks away
a crazy man in a wheelchair is wheel up to the accident victim who is bleeding profusely and in a state of shock
the man in the wheelchair stares at him for a moment
same fuckin thing happened to me last year
pace looks up at his mother
i still aint sure what my daddy looks like
like you sweetheart
you and your daddy got the same mouth eyes ears and nose
only difference is your color hair is like mine
my daddy aint never killed nobody has he mama
course he aint never killed nobody

grandmama said how sailor murdered a man
your daddy never committed no murder
musta been you didnt hear grandmama proper
he made some mistakes is all
your daddy aint always been so lucky

sit back a minute
lula pulls the camaro into in the station parking lot and kills the engine
why we sittin here mama
thinkin a second baby
lula gets out and goes around for pace
they hold hands as they walk toward the station
the big clock on the side of the building shows ten minutes past six
im scared mama
case daddy dont like me
what if he dont like that i dont got his color hair
pace your daddyd love you even if you didnt have no hair at all
lula sees sailor as soon as she opens the door
he is sitting in an orange plastic chair against the opposite wall smoking a cigarette
still partial to camels huh
first pack of tailor mades i had in a while
he stands up and looks down at pace who is still holding hands with lula
sailor puts out his right hand
you must be my son
shake hands with your daddy
pace releases lulas hand and puts his own in sailors
sailor grips it gently but firmly pumps once then lets go
pleasure to meet you pace
i read a lot about you
sailor looks at lula
her eyes are full of tears and she lets them loose
sailor tries to smile
pace and i aint had dinner yet
lead the way
sailor picks up his black metal suitcase and follows them to the car
no rag top huh
lula starts to reply then stops
she stares straight ahead gripping the wheel hard
suddenly she pulls over to the side of the road turns off the engine and gets out of the car
whats wrong mama
turning to pace and patting his head dont worry son
just stay here
sailor gets out and goes over to lula who is leaning back against the hood
im sorry sailor
i just cant help it

boys frightened lula
this aint no good
really sail ill be okay
its a mistake honey
you two go on
ill walk back to the depot
whatre you talkin about
thats your son in there
he aint never known me lula so there aint much for him to forget
not seein each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us too
how can you say that sailor
what makes sense is all
sailor goes around to the drivers side reaches in and pulls the keys out of the ignition
he unlocks the trunk removes his suitcase and closes the lid
dont do this sailor please
sailor slips the keys in her shirt pocket and leans his head into the car
to pace oiga amigo
if ever somethin dont feel right to you remember what pancho said to the cisco kid
lets went before we are dancing at the end of a rope without music
sailor stands up and looks at lula
her eye makeup runs in dark streaks down her face
ecu of lulas eyes
her eye makeup runs like black sweat over eyes and down her cheeks as in sailors dream
you been doin fine without me peanut
there aint no need to make life toughern it has to be
he picks up his suitcase kisses lula lightly on the lips and walks away
she lets him go
sailor walks down the street pretending hard not to care
lula climbs in behind the wheel sobbing
pace sits sadly staring out the window
sailor continues walking down the street
a gang of insane killer teenagers on pcp appear and come towards sailor
they circle around him coming in closer for the kill
what do you faggots want
thats all it takes
the gang is on him
sailor tries to defend himself but one big punch to his nose sends him down and out
blood begins to pour from his swelling nose
cu of sailors face a bright light illuminates it
in the sky above sailor a large glowing bubble holding the beautiful good witch of the north comes floating down above him
sailors eyes suddenly see the good witch through his closed eyelids
his mouth speaks through closed lips
the good witch
lula loves you
but im a robber and a manslaughterer and i havent had any parental guidance
shes forgiven you of all these things you love her
dont be afraid sailor
but im wild at heart
if you are truly wild at heart youll fight for your dreams
dont turn away from love sailor
dont turn away from love
dont turn away from love
the good witch disappears
sailor opens his eyes and drags himself and his giant swollen nose up on his feet
the gang still stands around him
you had enough asshole
yes i have
and i wanna apologize to you gentlemen for referring to you as homosexuals
i also want to thank you fellas youve taught me a valuable lesson in life
lifts his head high sailor turns around and starts running back
the gang watches him go
lula sits in the car in the middle of a giant traffic jam
she is still crying and horns are honking all around them
sailor runs up the street holding his nose and screaming lulas name
he rounds a corner and spots her in the middle of a sea of cars
he starts running towards her leaping from one car to another until he jumps on the hood of lulas car
she sees him
lula wriggles out of the car and flys into his arms
behind them is a giant golden sunset
as they embrace the sound of the horns goes away
lulas gaze goes to a reflection of golden light on a windshield
it is the same abstract scene she saw before in her room in big tuna but now she knows what it is
it is paces happy smiling eyes looking up at the two of them in love
sailor with a giant blue nose looks into lulas eyes and sings love me tender
the people in their cars and the people on the street look on with a feeling of love and happiness in their hearts
