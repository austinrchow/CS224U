written by robert previous hit riskin based on a story by samuel hopkins adams the harbor at miami beach fades in providing quick views of yachts aquaplanes and luxurious ship
craft lying at anchor in the calm tranquil waters of tropical florida
this dissolves to the name plate on the side of a yacht reading elspeth ii and this in turn to a yacht corridor where a steward is standing in front
of a cabin door near a small collapsible table upon which there is a tray of steaming food
he lifts lids and examines the contents
a heavy set sailor stands guard near the cabin door
she ought to like this
to the guard open the door
without moving whos gonna take it in to her
the view widens to include mullison a waiter
his eye is decorated with a shiner
not me sir
she threw a ketchup bottle at me this morning
well orders are orders
somebodys gotta take it in
he turns to someone else fredericks
the view moves to another waiter who has a patch of bandage on his face
before i bring her another meal ill be put off the ship first
the view moves over to a frenchman
vehemently no monsieur
when i leave the ritz you do not say i have to wait on crazy womans
the view moves back to include the steward and the others grouped around him
my wife was an angel compared to this one sir
and i walked out on her
impatiently come on
make up your mind
a petty officer approaches
he is blustering and officious but the type that is feeble and ineffective
his name is lacey
talking quicklystaccato whats up
there is a fairly close picture of the group featuring lacey and the steward
theyre afraid to take her food in
afraid of a mere girl
he wheels on the steward why didnt you do it yourself
more afraid than the othersstammering whyiwell i never thought about shoving him aside i never heard of such a thing
afraid of a mere girl
moving to the tray ill take it in myself
they all stand around and watch him much relieved
he picks up the tray and starts toward the door of the cabin
as he walksmuttering cant get a thing done unless you do it yourself
as he approaches the door open the door
we see him at the cabin door as the guard quickly and gingerly unlocks it
afraid of a mere girl
lacey stalks in bravely the tray held majestically in front of him while the steward and waiters form a circle around the door waiting expectantly
there is a short pause following which lacey comes hurling out backwards and lands on his back the tray of food scattering all over him
the steward quickly bangs the door shut and turns the key as the waiters stare silently
the scene dissolves to the main deck of the yacht first affording a close view of a pair of well shod masculine feet as they pace agitatedly back and forth
then as the scene draws back the possessor of the pacing feet is discovered to be alexander andrews immaculately groomed in yachting clothes
in front of him stands a uniformed captain but andrews brows wrinkled deep in thought continues his pacing
murmuring to himself on a hunger strike huh
a grunt whend she eat last
she hasnt had a thing yesterdayor today
been sending her meals in regularly
she refuses them all
snappily why didnt you jam it down her throat
its not quite that simple
he shakes his head ive dealt with prisoners in my time but this one absurd
muttering all this fuss over a snip of a girl
suddenly im going down to see her myself
he leaves with determination followed by the captain and both are then seen walking in the direction of the cabin andrews grim
this is dangerous business mr
after all kidnapping is no childs play
but andrews ignores him and merely stares grimly forward
they arrive in front of the cabin door where lacey is brushing himself off and where a couple of waiters are picking up the last pieces of the broken dishes
whats happened here
pathetically she refused another meal sir
get another tray ready
bring it here at once
to the guard open the door
the guard unlocks the door and andrews enters
then we get a view of the cabin at the door as andrews enters and closes the door behind him
he looks around and his eyes light on his prisoner following which the view swings over to ellie a beautiful girl in her early twenties
at the moment she holds a small vase over her head ready to heave it and her eyes flash angrily
at sight of her new visitor however she lowers the vase and sets it on a small table
what do you want
andrews doesnt stir from the door
whats this about not eating
sitting i dont want to eat
raising her voice and theres one more thing i dont want
thats to see you
she lights a cigarette
andrews watches her a moment
know what my next move is
no more cigarettes
why dont you put me in chains
now seen at close range all right
put me in chains
do anything you want
but im not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat
she stares petulantly out at the blue sky but andrews comes over and sits beside her
tenderly come on ellie
stop being silly
you know im going to have my way
moving away i wont stand for it
i wont stand for your running my life
why do you insist on it
still tender you ought to know why
because interrupting yes
shes heard it a million times because im your daughter and you love me
because you dont want me to make any mistakes
because joining in because marrying that fool king westley is
snappily youre wasting your time
im already married to him
sharply not so far as im concerned youre not
they are interrupted by a knock at the door yes
the door opens and several waiters parade in with trays of steaming food
starting for them threateningly how many times have i told you not to bring any food in here
the waiters back up frightened but andrews saves them
wait a minute
dont get excited
this isnt for you
to the waiters put it right here
ellie glares at her father and wanders over to the window seat while the waiters occupy themselves setting the table
andrews putters around the food lifting the lids from which tempting aromas emanate
he shuts his eyes murmuring oohs and ahs
a close up of ellie shows her too drinking in the inviting aromas and for a moment she weakens
a close view of andrews shows him glancing toward ellie to see her reaction whereupon ellies face again appearing in a close up freezes
then andrews and the waiters come into view
anything else monsieur
everything seems quite satisfactory
i may want some more of that delicious gravy
very good monsieur
the waiters bow their way out as andrews pecks at the food
making clucking noise heavenly
now ellie appears in the foreground with andrews at the table in the background
disdainfully smart arent you
chewing on a mouthful of food if gandhi had a chef like paul it would change the whole political situation in india
you cant tempt me
shouting unnecessarily do you hear
i wont eat
i cant fight on an empty stomach
remember what napoleon said
i hope youre not comparing yourself to napoleon
he was a strategist
your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe
andrews eats silently while ellie rants at him walking around and puffing vigorously on her cigarette
muttering most humiliating thing ever happened to me
shuddering a bunch of gorillas shoving me in a car
that crowd outside the justice of the peacemust have thought i was a criminalor something
a close view of andrews intercuts with part of ellies speech
at the end of her speech he smacks his lips enjoying the food with too great a relish
then the two are seen together
after a pausestrongly where are you taking me
carelessly south america
aghast south america
we leave miami in an hour
soons we get some supplies aboard
threateningly youll have a corpse on your hands
that what youll have
i wont eat a thing while im on this boat
buttering bread in that event we wont need so many supplies
exasperated what do you expect to accomplish by all this
im already married
ill get it annulled
youll never do it
you cant do it
now seen close as he speaks between snatches of food ill do it if it takes every penny ive got
ill do it if i have to bribe that musical comedy justice of the peace
ill do itif i have to prove that you were dragged in staggering drunk
you probably were
he smacks his lips mmmmmm
this filet mignon is divine
seen with her father whatve you got against king westley
i just think hes a fake thats all
you only met him once
that was enough
do you mind handing me the ketchup
you talk as if he were a gigoloor something
risingreaching for ketchup never mindill get it myself
he falls back in his chair gigolo
why you took the word right out of my mouth
seen closer now with andrews hes one of the best fliers in the country
right now hes planning a trip to japan
youre going to finance him i suppose
look what hes doing for aviation
it takes courage to do what he does
at least hes accomplished something worthwhile
i suppose youd like to have me marry a business man
well i hate business menparticularly if youre a shining example
he grins not at all offended knowing she doesnt mean it
your whole life is devoted to just one thing
to accumulate more money
at least theres romance in what hes doing
unequivocally hes no good ellie and you know it
you married him only because i told you not to
strongly youve been telling me what not to do since i was old enough to remember
screaming im sick of it
and as andrews ignores her she starts moving around the table toward him
next she appears sitting on the edge of andrews chair and she throws her arm around his shoulder
pleading sweetly aw listen dad
lets not fight like this any more
i know youre worried about meand want me to be happy
and i love you for it
but please try to understand
youre not being fair darling
this isnt just a crazy impulse of mine
king and i talked about it a lot before we decided to get married
lookwhy cant we give it a triallets sayfor a year or so
if its wrong king and i will be the first to know it
we can get a divorce cant we
now be a dear and let me off the boat
keeping me prisoner like this is so silly
andrews has been listening silently throughout the speech giving no indication of his feelings in the matter
unimpressed youll be set free when the marriage is annulled
a close up of ellie her eyes blazing angrily shows her slowly edging away from her father while he continues
carelessly so theres no use being a stubborn idiot
hissing i come from a long line of stubborn idiots
again seen with her calmly a time will come when youll thank me for this
wildly i wont thank you
ill never thank you
please dont shout
ill shout to my hearts content
ill scream if i want to
reaching for it ah
coconut layer cake
nice and gooey too
just the way i like it
he is about to insert the first bite in his mouth when ellie her temper vanishing completely overturns the small serving table dumping its contents into her fathers lap
the movement is so unexpected that andrews the fork still suspended near his mouth stares at her stupefied
then realizing what she has done his eyes flash in anger
dropping his fork he rises and goes over to her while she stands facing him defiantly
without a word or warning he slaps her a stinging blow across the cheek
for a moment she doesnt stir her eyes widening in surprise and staring at him unbelievingly
then turning abruptly she bolts out of the door
andrews remains motionless his eyes shutting painfully it is the first time he has struck her and it hurts
and he starts for the door next on the deck at the open cabin door andrews is seen staring off at something and an amazed frightened look comes into his
then as viewed from his position at the cabin door ellie appears standing on the rail and with a professional dive she leaps into the water
a full view of the deck reveals the crew and the officers scurrying around several of them shouting somebody overboard
its my daughter
go after her
shouting lower the boats
general excitement reigns several of the crew dive into the water others release the boat lines
following this ellie is seen swimming furiously against the giant waves
next she appears as a small speck in the distance while half a dozen of the crew are swimming in pursuit
at the side of the yacht one of the boats has already been lowered and two men jump in and grab the oars
the men seem to be gaining on ellie
in the distance several small motor boats are anchored and over the sides of the boats their owners are fishing
ellie seems to be headed in their direction
one of the motor boats appears closer
a middle aged man sits on the stern holding lazily to his line his feet dangling in the water as the boat is tossed around by the turbulent waves
ellie is then again seen swimming
she looks back and the next scene shows the men rowing toward her and gaining on her
thereupon we see ellie ducking under the water
the middle aged fisherman is suddenly startled by ellies face which appears from under water right between his legs
ellie puts her finger up to her lips warning him to shush and he is too dumb founded to say anything
as the pursuing boats come near ellie ducks under the water again and the boats scoot right by the fisherman
then ellies head bobs up she peers ahead of her and seeing that her pursuers have passed her she smiles victoriously
to the fisherman thanks
and she starts swimming toward shore the scene dissolves to the deck of the yacht as ellies pursuers clamber aboard andrews waiting for them
she got away
disappointed but proud of course she got awaytoo smart for you
what a hell cat
no controlling these modern girls
murmuring theyre terrible
nothing terrible about her
got a mind of her own
knows just what she wants
smiling shes not going to get it though
she wont get very far
has no money
what about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that
his face falling holy smoke
i forgot all about that
to the officer by his side send a wireless at once lovington detective agency
daughter escaped again
watch all roadsall transports and railroad stations in miami
have your new york office keep tabs on king westley
intercept all messages
want her back at all costs
the view draws in to afford a close up of andrews staring out at the sea his face wreathed in a broad smile then this fades out
part two the railroad station of an active terminal in miami fades in
the view moves down to the entrance gate to the trains passengers hur
rying through it then picks out two men obviously detectives who have their eyes peeled on everyone passing through
then the view affords a glimpse of ellie who stands watching the detectives
this scene wiping off we see an air transport with several planes tuning up in the background
as passengers file through several detectives stand around in a watchful pose
this scene wiping off the front of a western union office comes into view
several people walk in and out
at the side of the door two detectives are on the lookout
this scene also wipes off revealing the waiting room of a bus station
over the ticket window there is a sign reading buy bus tickets here and a line forms in front of it
here too there are two detectives
were wastin our time
can you picture ellie andrews ridin on a bus
i told the old man it was the bunk
the view moves from them to ellie who stands behind a post and is watching the two detectives apprehensively
as the two viewed from her position stand by the ticket window one of them turns toward her
thereupon we see her slipping behind a post concealing herself
just then a little old lady approaches her
heres your ticket maam
oh thank you
thank you very much
she takes the ticket and change from the old lady and hands her a bill here
oh thank you
when does the bus leave
in about fifteen minutes
she picks up a small overnight bag from the floor and hurries away
she crosses to the entrance of the waiting room and disappears through the doors
the view then wings over to a telephone booth near the entrance
clustered around the booth are half a dozen men of varied appearance
the inside of the booth is lighted and a young man peter warne waves his hands wildly as he shouts into the phone although it is impossible to hear what
he is saying
a close inspection of the men surrounding the booth the scene contracting to a close view reveals them as being slightly and happily intoxicated
a short man approaches the door of the booth
hey whats going on here
id like to use that phone
a reporter shh
this is history in the making
theres a man biting a dog in there
drunker than the rest atta boy petey old boy
im not going to stand for this any longer
in a pigs eye you will
is that so
thats telling him petey old boy
a close view of peter warne in the telephone booth gives evidence of his having also imbibed freely
shouting into the phone listen monkey facewhen you fired me you fired the best newshound your filthy scandal sheet ever had
and the scene cuts to a new york newspaper office where the night editor gordon his sleeves rolled up sits at his desk shrieking into the phone
say listen you wouldnt know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the pants
sure sure i got your copy
why didnt you tell me you were going to write it in greek
id start a new department
again seen close at the phone that was free verse you gashouse palooka
at the phone in the newspaper office free verse huh
shouting what the dickens was free about it
it cost this paper a gob of dough
well im here to tell you its not gonna cost us any more
in his phone booth thats okay by me
cause as far as im concerned im through with newspapers
im through with stupidity
ill never write another newspaper story for you or anybody else if i have to starve
after a pause yeah
what about my novel
when i get through with that in his office when you get through with that ill have a beard down to my ankles
at this point gordons secretary enters mr
gordon looking up huh
did you know he reversed the charges on that call
into the phone say listen you
when you get back to new york take my advice and stay f a r away from this officeunless you dont care what happens to that funny map of yours
he bangs down the receiver viciously and glowers at the phone in the phone booth peter reacts to the phone being hung up on him
but he goes right on for the benefit of the boys
into the dead phone oh so youre changing your tune eh
well its about time
but its going to do you no good my tough friend
its a little too late for apologies
i wouldnt go back to work for you if you begged me on your hands and knees
i hope this is a lesson to you
he snaps up the receiver with a great pretense of outraged pride following which the view expands to include his public
atta boy peter
thats telling him peter
the gang is full of admiration for the courageous way he talked to the boss as peter staggers out of the booth
give me any of his lip will he
i guess he knows now what i think of his job
expansively is my chariot ready
your chariot awaiteth withouteth oh mighty king
make way for the king
long live the king
with head held high he struts majestically out of sight followed by his admirers following which the scene dissolves to the bus station
his inebriated admirers stand around the entrance to a bus while peter stands on the steps his suitcase in his hand
making a grand speech thats right my friends
cling to your jobs
remain slaves the rest of your lives
scum of the earth
when im basking in the glorious arms of the musewhatll you be doing
you miserable worms
a mere pittance
my heart goes out to you
with arms extended and in tremolo voice good bye
and with this he turns his back and enters the bus in the same spirit goodbye oh mighty king
peace be with you courageous one
philadelphia new york
the scene cuts to the interior of the bus as viewed from the front the view moving forward passing the conglomerate of unprepossessing human beings who occupy the seats
every space is taken and the occupants seem hot and uncomfortable which adds to their uninviting appearance
mothers cling to crying babies
a swedish farm hand and his young wife are already busy opening their basket of food prepared for the long journey
a surly looking hoodlum traveling alone is slumped in his seat his cap drawn carelessly over his eyes
the moving view passes these and other characters until it reaches one unoccupied seat in the car unoccupied except for several bundles of newspapers
standing before the seat is peter his suitcase in his hand speculating as to what disposition to make of the newspapers
calling hey driver
how about clearing this stuff away
several passengers seen from his position in the back crane their necks to scrutinize the intruder
through a glass partition the driver can be seen receiving his last minute instructions from a superintendent who stands on the running board their voices in
in answer to peters request the driver glances back indifferently and continues talking to the superintendent
a close view of peter shows him arching his eyebrows an amused acknowledgment of the disdainful attitude of the driver
he drops his suitcase and starts forward
then we see him arriving at the glass partition and peter taps playfully on the pane with his finger nails whereupon the driver turns and pulls the window down a
annoyed whadda you want
pleasantly if youll be good enough to remove those newspapers ill have a seat
keep your shirt on young feller
with which remark the driver turns away from him looking at the back of the drivers neck for a moment then confidentially just between you and me i never intended
taking it off
he wheels around uncertainly and swaggers jauntily down the aisle toward the empty seat
en route he bestows genial smiles upon several of his disgruntled fellow passengers and he stops in front of a robust lady who at the moment is breastfeeding her baby
while a lighted cigarette dangles from her lips
personally i was raised on a bottle
as the woman looks up at him perplexed when i was a baby i insisted on it
you know why
as the woman stares up stupidly i never liked the idea of getting cigarette ashes in my eyes
he moves forward leaving the woman unable to make head or tail of it and assuming that hes crazy she shrugs her shoulders and turns her attention to the baby
now peter arrives at his seat and whistling softly raises the window
unhurriedly he picks the newspaper bundles up one by one and flings them out of the window
they hit the sidewalk below with a dull thud
thereupon a close view of the driver shows him reacting violently to peters unprecedented cheek and starting down from his seat
peter has now cleared the seat of all the newspaper bundles and still whistling his favorite melody he picks up his suitcase preparatory to placing it in the rack overhead
at this point the driver enters the side door of the bus
pugnaciously hey wait a minute
peter his arms holding the suitcase over his head turns and glances at the driver a quizzical look in his eyes
coming forward what do you think youre doing
bellowing the papers
whadda you mean throwin em out
ohthe papers he slowly lowers his arms and deposits the suitcase on the floor
now seen close with the driver thats a long story my friend
you see i dont like sitting on newspapers
i did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants
hey whadda you tryin to dokid me
oh i wouldnt kid you
on the level it actually happened
nobody bought a paper that day
they followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants
whatre you gonna do about the papers
somebodys gotta pick em up
turning to his suitcase its okay with me
im not arguing
pugnaciously fresh guy huh
what you need is a good sock on the nose
turning back to him look here partner
you may not like my nose
but i do
its a good nose
the only one ive got
i always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it
if you decide to do it make sure you dont miss
during his speech ellie enters from the rear and plunks herself into peters seat
unseen by peter she places her small bag beside her
answering peter weakly oh yeah
now thats a brilliant answer
why didnt i think of it
our conversation could have been over long ago
exhausted you win
smiling he turns to sit down
but the smile dies on his face when he finds his place occupied by ellie who stares out the window
now at close range with ellie excuse me lady slowly but that upon which you sitis mine
ellie glances up at himthen down at her buttocks
eyes flashing i beg your pardon
im in a very ugly mood
i put up a stiff battle for that seat
so if its just the same to you gesturing with thumb scram
ignoring himcalling driver
the driver who has stopped to witness this new altercation returns
are those seats reserved
pleased to discomfort peter no
first come first served
dismissing the whole thing thank you
peter thwarted for a moment just glares at her also calling driver
these seats accommodate two passengers dont they
hating to give in maybe they doand maybe they dont
peter lifts ellies overnight bag off the seat and drops it on the floor
part of her coat covers the small space by her side
this he sweeps across her lap
move over lady
this is a maybe they do
he plops into the seat the other passengers around them heaving a sigh of relief
ellie flashes him a devastating look and deliberately turns her back on him
but peter suddenly looks down toward the floor following which a close up at their feet reveals that ellies bag on the floor annoys peter
with his foot he slowly moves it over to her and ellies foot is seen pushing it back whereupon peter viciously kicks it over to her side again
next we see ellie glaring at him picking up her bag and standing on the seat depositing it on the rack overhead
but just then the bus starts forward with a lurch which unbalances her and she falls backward right in peters lap
their noses almost touch
their eyes meet and they glare at each other hostilely
ellie quickly scrambles off and gets back in her seat turning her back on him
amused next time you drop in bring your folks
this dissolves to a country road and the bus sways perilously as it speeds through the night following which the view dissolves to the interior of the bus revealing peter
slumped in his seat his hat drawn over his eyes
ellie has her head thrown back trying to sleep
but the swaying bus causes her head to roll from side to side uncomfortably and finally she gives up
an order tell that man not to drive so fast
at which peter just cocks his head slightly are you talking to me
tell that man to drive slowly
peter stares at her a moment resenting her officious manner
and much to her surprise he sighs deeply and relaxes to his former position shutting his eyes
she glares at him crushingly
the scene dissolves to another view of the bus disclosing the driver and suddenly the bus comes to a stop
sticking his head in to face the passengers rest station
the view draws back as some of the passengers rise
the men stretch their legs and the women straighten out their skirts
a close view of peter and ellie then shows her rising
peter accommodatingly shoves his feet aside for her to pass and ellie starts up the aisle
but she suddenly stops looks back first at her bag and then at peter decides to take her bag with her and returns to take it
she reaches for it on the rack peter watching her amused
the scene dissolves to the outside of the rest station with several passengers walking briskly back and forth
the place is dimly lit by one or two lamp posts and peter can be seen leaning against one of these posts smoking a cigarette
the scene moving in a close view of peter shows him stealing a glance in the direction of ellie
and a view from his angle reveals ellie in the shadow of the bus her bag at her feet
she slowly turns her head toward peter and then quickly averts it
peter seen close speculates about her
he glances around the place and the scene moves about following his gaze
it takes in the other passengers all obviously poor and uncultured
the moving view reaches ellie
the contrast is perceptible
thereupon we see peter reacting with comprehension no doubt about it
she doesnt belong with these passengers
then suddenly he sees something which startles him and we see what it is directly in back of her the young hoodlum passenger slyly lifts her overnight bag from the
ground and starts running with it
ellie is oblivious of his actions
peter springs forward
ellie sees peter coming toward her and is perceptibly startled
but peter whizzes by her and this amazes her even more
she shrugs her shoulders perplexed and resumes her smoking
in a few seconds peter returns puffing breathlessly
he got away
i suddenly found myself in the middle of the brush and not a sign of the skunk
ellie seen close with peter doesnt know what hes talking about
she looks at him puzzled
i dont know what youre raving about young man
and furthermore im not interested
taken aback wellof all thewell hard maybe youll be interested to know your bags gone
at this ellie wheels around and stares at the spot where her bag had been
oh my heavens
i knew youd catch on eventually
that cadaverous looking yegg who sat in front of us just up and took it
boy how that baby can run
what am i going to do now
dont tell me your ticket was in it
opening her purse no ive got that all right
but my money
all i have here is four dollars
ive got to get to new york with it
you can wire home for some money when we get to jacksonville
why noi catching herself yes
i guess i will
starting out ill report it to the driver
about your bag i mean
id rather you didnt
dont be a fool
you lost your bag
the companyll make good
whats your name
i dont want it reported
why thats ridiculous
theyre responsible for everything that hotly see here can you understand english
i dont want it reported
she starts away please stay out of my affairs
i want to be left alone
with which she disappears from the scene a close up of peter shows him glaring after her
mumbling why you ungrateful brat
the scene dissolves to the bus where all the passengers are scattering back to their seats peter is already seated when ellie arrives
a close view then shows her standing uncertainly for a moment speculating whether to cross over his legs to get her place by the window
peter feels her presence by his side and glances up
she tosses her head and plants herself in the seat in front of him vacated by the young man who stole her bag
peter takes the affront with a shrug and slides over gratefully to the coveted spot near the window
the scene dissolves to a close view of ellie and a recently arrived fat man next to her
she has her head thrown back in an effort to sleep but the fat man his hands clasped over his protruding stomach snores disgustingly and the rumble of the flying
bus accompanies him
suddenly the bus careens the fat man falls against ellie and she awakens with a start and pushes him back
the fat mans snoring goes on uninterrupted and ellie relaxes again but in a few seconds the procedure is repeated and ellie is beside herself
she looks around for somewhere to flee
peter seated in back of her in his customary slumped position opens his eyes slightly
it is apparent he has been watching her for some time for he grins at her discomfiture
ellies head turns in his direction and the grin leaves peters face
he shuts his eyes and pretends to be asleep
ellie glances at peter to make certain he is asleep
the fat man falls against her again and it is all she can stand
she starts to rise
peter sees her coming and deliberately puts his hand on the seat next to him still pretending to be asleep
just as ellie starts to sit she notices his hand and is embarrassed
gingerly she picks up his limp hand and places it on his knee
she then slides into the seat sighing with relief whereupon peter opens his eyes and is amused
slowly his head turnsand he scrutinizes her soberly and appraisingly
ellie slowly turns her head for a glimpse of peterand is startled to find him gazing at her
she turns forward her jaw set forbiddingly
the scene dissolves to the view of a road
it is dawn and in the distance against the horizon the bus a mere speck makes its lone way over the deserted country
this dissolves to a large sign reading jacksonville and then into the bus affording a close view of ellie and peter
they are both asleep her head resting comfortably on his shoulder peters topcoat thrown over her
then the view draws back
the bus is empty except for ellie and peter the last few passengers are just leaving
peters eyes slowly open
he looks down at the head on his shoulder and grins
with a sigh he shuts his eyes again and resumes his slumber
next at the front of the bus the driver stands staring at peter and ellie in this intimate position and his mouth twists knowingly
murmuring oh yeah
ellie stirs squirms a little uncomfortably and with a sleepy grunt shifts her position
just as she settles down her eyes open
she stares out of the window with unseeing eyes and then closes them
dreamily giving the impression that still half conscious she is trying to recall where she is
apparently she does for her eyes suddenly snap open and she lifts her head
finally in a scene including peter ellie realizes that she has been sleeping on his shoulder whereupon she straightens up embarrassed
oh im sorry feebly smiling silly isnt it
she looks around and her finding herself alone with peter adds to her embarrassment
she lifts her arms to adjust her hat and becomes conscious of his coat over her which slips
she stares at it thoughtfully for a momentthen at peter
realizing that he put it there oh thank you
she hands him his coat ill at ease were in jacksonville arent we
nervously that was foolish of me
why didnt you shove me away
i hated to wake you up
she glances at him speculatively how about some breakfast
no thank you
she rises anxious to get away thank you so much
most uncomfortably she edges away from him toward the front of the bus peter watching her leave his interest definitely provoked
the scene cuts to the stand as ellie emerges from the bus
at the foot of the steps is the driver
how much time have i
about a half hour
im going over to the windsor hotel
peter appears in the door of the bus in the background and a close view then shows him stopping to listen as he sees ellie talking to the driver
youll never make it in time
youll have to wait for me
aghast wait for you
a smile flits across peters face then a wider view shows ellie leaving the driver
as she goes yes
i may be a few minutes late
she disappears from sight leaving the driver staring at her dumbly and peter standing in back of the driver shakes his head in amazement
the scene dissolves to the bus stand later that morningat the same spot where the bus had previously been
it is no longer there however
a huge crowd fills the space and the view moving down through the crowd singles ellie out
she has just arrived and looks around helplessly
finally she spots a uniformed terminal guard and approaches him
now next to the guard wheres the bus to new york
left twenty minutes ago
why thats ridiculous
i was on that busi told them to wait
and he turns his back on her ellies face clouds
the crowds surge about her
she looks around thoughtfully
suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees and the view then moves over to peter who sits on his suitcase looking toward ellie
peter is in the foreground the guard is seen in the background
ellie stares at peter perplexed
im the fellow you slept on last night
seems to me ive already thanked you for that
turning to guard what time is the next bus to new york
turning eight oclock tonight
why thats twelve hours
the guard leaves the scene and ellies disappointment is apparent
sarcastically whats the matter
wouldnt the old meanies wait for you
ellie glares at him disdaining to replythis angers him and he continues hotly say how old are you anyway
dont you know these busses work on a schedule
you need a guardian
starting away what are you excited about
you missed the bus too
peter looks at her a moment before replying
i missed it too
there is a close view of the two
she turns to him
her interest is provoked by his tone of voice
she glances up into his face
dont tell me you did it on my account
pause i hope youre not getting any idea that what happened last night is she interrupts herself you neednt concern yourself about me young man
i can take care of myself
youre doing a pretty sloppy job of it
he reaches in his pocket heres your ticket
surprised my ticket
i found it on the seat
taking it oh thank you
must have fallen out of my pocket
while she is putting the ticket away in her purse peter speaks youll never get away with it miss andrews
this is a shock to ellie weakly what are you talking about
just a spoiled brat of a rich man
you and westleyll make an ideal team
bluffing it through will you please tell me what youre raving about
youll never get away with it miss andrews
your fatherll stop you before you get half way to new york
you must have me confused with interrupting quit kidding
its all over the front pages you know ive always been curious about the kind of a girl that would marry king westley
he pulls a newspaper out of his pocket and hands it to her
ellie glances at the headline hurriedly
while she reads take my advicegrab the first bus back to miami
that guys a phony
looking up at him i didnt ask for your advice
she hands the paper back thats right
youre not going to notify my father are you
looking at her squarely what for
if you play your cards right you might get some money out of it
a disdainful expression crosses his face i never thought of that
frantically listen if youll promise not to do it ill pay you
ill pay you as much as he will
you wont gain anything by giving me away as long as im willing to make it worth your while
ive got to get to new york without being stopped
its terribly important to me
id pay now only the only thing i had when i jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and i had to pawn that to get these clothes
ill give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to new york
furious never mind
you know i had you pegged right from the start youre the spoiled brat of a rich father
the only way you can get anything is to buy it
now youre in a jam and all you can think of is your money
it never fails does it
ever hear of the word humility
no you wouldnt
i guess it never occurred to you to just say please mister im in trouble
will you help me
no thatd bring you down off your high horse for a minute
let me tell you something maybe itd take a load off your mind
you dont have to worry about me
im not interested in your money or your problems
you king westley your father youre all a lot of hooey to me
he turns his back on her and leaves
a close up of ellie shows her staring after him her eyes blazing angrily
in a telegraph office peter addresses a girl operator as he drops a telegram on the counter which she reads
brusquely you send telegrams here
recognizing him apparently sarcastically im just fine thanks and how are you
reading to joe gordon care of new york mail new york
am i laughing
the biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap
i know where ellen andrews is looking up excitedly no do you really
impatiently go on
go on send the telegram
how would you like to have the story you big tub ofof mush
tub of mush
well try and get it
what i said about never writing another line for you still goes
are you burning
well that will be
send it collect
peter firmly collect
as the clerk takes the wire from him scene fades out
part three the bus terminal fades in
it is night now and the rain comes down in torrents
people scurry around to get into the buses as the voice of an announcer is heard bus for blah blah blah blahcharlestonblah blah blahand all points north to new york
this dissolves to the interior of a bus which is practically filled
peter is in his seat reading a magazine while ellie enters hurriedly from the rear door and starts forward
as she approaches peter she hesitates a second and deliberately passes him plunking herself into a seat in the opposite aisle
peter turns just as she gets seated
he glances at her indifferently
a close view shows ellie seated next to a man who sits reading a newspaper which covers his face
her eyes are fixed forward her lips set adamantly
a close up of the man next to ellie makes it plain that he is a typical drummer
at the moment he is absorbed in a serial story but suddenly he becomes aware of something at his feet and without lowering the newspaper his gaze slowly shifts downward
at this the view moves down until it reaches ellies trim ankles
her feet beat a regular tattoo on the floor her extreme agitation is evident
the view moves back slowly taking in ellies shapely leg as far as the knee
then we see ellie and the drummer as his gaze is still fixed on her leg
slowly his face breaks into a lascivious grin he lowers his paper and turns for a scrutiny of her face
what he sees apparently delights him for he drops his paper completelyand smiles broadly
hi sisterall alone
my names shapeley
ellie favors him with a devastating look which is wasted on the drummer might as well get acquainted
its gonna be a long tripgets tiresome later on
specially for somebody like you
you look like you got class
he surveys her from head to foot yessir
with a capital k
he chuckles at his own sally and im a guy that knows class when he sees it believe you me
a close up of ellie as shapeleys voice continues shows her glancing back at peter expecting him to come to her rescue
ask any of the boys
theyll tell you
shapeley sure knows how to pick em
shapeleys the name and thats the way i like em
ellie again looks toward peter
but peter seems to have found something of unusual interest in his magazine and we again see the harassed ellie and the irrepressible shapeley who continues
you made no mistake sitting next to me
confidentially just between us the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this aint nothing to write home to the wife about
you gotta be awful careful who you hit up with is what i always say and you cant be too particular neither
once when i was comin through north carolina i got to gabbin with a good lookin mama
one of those young ones you know and plenty classy too
kinda struck my fancy
you know how it is
well sir you coulda knocked me over with a mack truck
i was just warming up when shes yanked offa the bus
who do you think she was
might as well give up
the girl bandit
the one the papers been writin about
he pulls out a cigar and continuesawed by the recollection yessir you coulda knocked me over with a mack truck
he lights his cigar takes a vigorous puff and turns to her again whats the matter sister
you aint sayin much
intending to freeze him seems to me youre doing excellently without any assistance
this however only brings a guffaw from the drummer thats pretty good
well shut my big nasty mouth
a close up shows ellie enduring more of this as shapeleys voice continues looks like youre one up on me
nothin i like better than to meet a high class mama that can snap em back at you
cause the colder they are the hotter they get is what i always say
now ellie and shapeley are seen together with peter seen in the background
take this last town i was in
i run into a damenot a bad looker eitherbut boy was she an iceberg
every time i opened my kisser she pulls a ten strike on me
it sure looked like cold turkey for old man shapeley
i sell office supplies see
and this hotsy totsy lays the damper on me quick
she dont need a thingand if she did she wouldnt buy it from a fresh mugg like me
well says i to myselfshapeley you better go to work
youre up against a lulu
well im here to tell you sister i opened up a line of fast chatter that had that dame spinnin like a russian dancer
before i got through she bought enough stuff to last the firm a year
and did she put on an act when i blew town
ellie has scarcely listened to him and has divided her attention between glancing back at peter and staring at shapeley as if he were insanenone of which bothers shapeley
he goes on with his merry chatter blowing rings of smoke in the direction of the ceiling
when a cold mama gets hotboy how she sizzles
she kinda cramped my style though
i didnt look at a dame for three towns
quickly not that i couldnt
for me its always a cinch
i got a much better chance than the local talent
confidentially you see theyre kinda leery about the local talent
too close to home
know what i mean
ellie has now reached the point where she could without any compunction strangle him
continuing over this glimpse of her desperation but take a bird like meits here todayand gone tomorrow
and what happens is nobodys business
at this time she turns helplessly toward peter but we see peter being deliberately oblivious of her presence following which the three are seen with peter in the background
but i dont go in for that kinda stuffmuch
i like to pick my fillies
take you for instance
youre my type
no kiddin sister
i could go for you in a big way
fun on the side shapeley they call me and the accent is on the fun believe you me
this is all ellie can stand snappily believe you me you bore me to distraction
but shapeley merely throws his head back and emits his characteristic guffaw laughing well youre two up on me now
he holds up two fingers approaching them hey you
shapeleys laugh dies down
he looks dumbly up at peter his two fingers still held in mid air
indicating his own seat theres a seat over there for you
whats the idea
id like to sit with myuhwifeif you dont mind
at which shapeleys face falls puzzled wife
come oncome on
rising oh excuse me
edging away i was just tryinyou knowto make things pleasant
and smiling sheepishly he sidles over to peters seat his two fingers still poised in air
peter plants himself next to ellie and totally ignoring her opens his magazine and resumes his reading
then ellie and peter are seen close together
she looks up at him
if you promise not to snap my head off id like to thank you
without turning forget it
i didnt do it for you
his voice got on my nerves
she feels herself crushed and ventures no further comment as peter resumes his interest in his magazine
a full view of the bus follows and there is silence for a while as the bus slows down and comes to a stop
almost simultaneously a boy makes his appearance selling magazines and candy
here you are folks
candypopcorncigarettesmagazines as ellie and peter are seen again she turns and calls to the boy here boy
turning to her whatd you do
wire one of your friends for money
rummaging in her purse no
itd be useless
fatherd get the wire before they would
as he enters yes maam
a box of chocolates please
to the boy never mind son
she doesnt want it
he gestures with his thumb for the boy to leave puzzled but the lady says of course i do
what do you mean to the boy beat it
and the boy frightened by his voice leaves resentfully you have your nerve
she starts to rise here boy
peter snatches the purse out of her hand and takes the money out
ellie stares at him dumbfounded
a dollar sixty
you had four dollars last night
how do you expect to get to new york at the rate youre going
vehemently thats none of your business
with finality youre on a budget from now on
he flings her purse back at her and pockets the money now just a minuteyou cant shut up
he returns to his magazine leaving her staring at him petulantly as the scene fades out
part four somewhere on the road at night
this is apparently on the outskirts of a town
two local policemen and our bus driver stand in the foreground near a police booth
the rain sweeps across their faces as they talk
the passengers in the bus which stands in the background stick their heads out trying to hear what is going on
you wont be able to pass till morning
not even then if this keeps up
peter approaches the group and is then seen with the officers and the driver
bridge washed outaround dawson
looks like we cant go through till morning
his only contribution not even then if this keeps up
any of your passengers want a place to sleeptheres an auto camp up yonder a piece
pointing up yonder
see the lights
dykes auto camp
he dashes toward the bus
then he appears at the side door of the bus
calling hey brat
he is about to enter when he sees ellie the view moves to the rear door of the bus
ellie stands on the bottom step
haughtily are you talking to me
come onwere stopping here for the night
he disappears inside the bus through the side door
with an independent toss of her head ellie turns and also enters the bus but through the rear door
the scene dissolves to dykes auto camp
ellie stands alone on the porch of a small bungalow sheltered from the rain
over her head is a sign reading office dyke auto co
she looks about her restlessly giving the impression that she has been waiting for someone
suddenly she is attracted by something and gazes in its direction
then as seen by ellie in a long view there appears about twenty yards away a small cabin lighted on the inside and from it peter emerges accompanied by a
we cannot hear what is being said from their movements however it is apparent that an exchange of money is taking place
dyke waves his hand in departure and starts toward ellie
at the same time peter calls to her shouting hey
were all set
saying which he enters the cabin ellie hesitates a moment then starts toward the cabin
now she is hurrying across the open space
en route she passes dyke
as they pass good evening
hope you and your husband rest comfortably
ellie keeps on running but suddenly she stops dead and looks back at dyke following which a close up of ellie shows her eyes opening wide with astonishment
her impulse is to call dyke back to make him repeat what he saidto make certain she heard him correctly
but dyke is gone and she turns and glances thoughtfully in the direction of the cabin
then slowly the corners of her mouth screw up in an attitude of cynicism
so thats it is it
he has given her no previous evidence of being on the make yet now with the first opportunity
her thoughts however are interrupted by peters voice well bratwhat do you say
as she doesnt stir there appears a close up view of peter standing in the doorway of the cabin looking toward ellie
impatiently come on
what are you going to do
stand there all night
he disappears inside for a long moment ellie is lost in speculation as to how to proceed
then tossing her head defiantly with her lips set grimly she starts toward the cabin until she reaches it stops in the doorway and peers in
as she does this there is a view of the inside of the cabin as seen by her at the door
except for two cots on either side of the room a few sticks of cane furniture a small table upon which stands an oil burner for cooking the place is
at the moment peter is attaching a clothes line across the center of the room
his suitcase is already open
and now ellie steps inside surveying the place contemptuously
but peter with his back to her is oblivious of her presence and as he works he hums his favorite melody
ellie finally breaks the silence
sarcastically darn clever these armenians
seen close as he turns yeah
yeah its a gift
but he finishes his hammering and turns to his suitcase seen with peter i just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband
carelessly oh i forgot to tell you
i registered as mr
the matter of fact way in which he says this causes her eyebrows to lift oh you did
what am i expected to doleap for joy
i kind of half expected you to thank me
your ego is colossal
yeah not bad
there is silence for a moment and peter proceeds with the unpacking of his suitcase
as she watches him ellies mood changes from one of anger to that of sarcasm
appearing in a close up her face disdainful compared to you my friend shapeleys an amateur
sharply whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this
youre positively the most conceited interrupting hey wait a minute
appearing beside her lets get something straightened out right now
if youve any peculiar ideas that im interested in you forget it
youre just a headline to me
frightened a headline
youre not a newspaper man are you
chalk up one for your side
now listen you want to get to king westley dont you
all right im here to help you
what i want is your story exclusive
a day to day account
all about your mad flight to happiness
i need that story
just between you and me ive got to have it
now isnt that just too cute
theres a brain behind that face of yours isnt there
youve got everything nicely figured out for yourself including this
oh thats a matter of simple mathematics
these cabins cost two bucks a night and im very sorry to inform you wifey dear but the family purse wont stand for our having separate establishments
he goes back to the business of laying out his things starting to leave well thank you
thank you very much but youve been very kind
but the rain outside causes her to hesitate oh yeah
its all right with me
go on out in the storm but im going to follow you see
and if you get tough ill just have to turn you over to your old man right now
now thats my whole plot in a nutshell
a simple story for simple people
now if you behave yourself ill see that you get to king westley if not ill just have to spill the beans to papa
now which of these beds do you prefer
while he speaks he has taken the extra blanket from the cot and hung it over the clothes line
this manages to divide the room in half
a close view at the door shows ellie watching him with interest
sarcastically that i suppose makes everythinguhquite all right
the previous scene returning oh this
i like privacy when i retire
im very delicate in that respect
prying eyes annoy me
he has the blanket spread out now behold the walls of jericho
maybe not as thick as the ones that joshua blew down with his trumpet but a lot safer
you see i have no trumpet
taking out pajamas now just to show you my hearts in the right place ill give you my best pair of pajamas
he flings them over to her and she catches them and throws them on her cot
throughout the scene she hasnt budged from the door but peter now prepares to undress
do you mind joining the israelites
youre not really serious about this are you
seen at close range going about the job of undressing very diffidently all right dont join the israelites
perhaps youre interested in how a man undresses
and he hangs his coat over the chair funny thing about that
quite a study in psychology
no two men do it alike
now his shirt is coming off a close view of ellie shows her standing stubbornly
i once knew a chap who kept his hat on until he was completely undressed
chuckling made a comical picture
as the scene includes both of them peter spreads his shirt over his coat
years later his secret came out
he wore a toupee
he lights a cigarette diffidently while she remains brazenly watching him her eyes flashing defiantly
i have an idiosyncrasy all my own
youll notice my coat came firstthen the tiethen the shirtnow according to hoyle the pants should come next
but thats where im different
he bends over i go for the shoes first
after that unable to stand it any longer smart aleck
and thoroughly exasperated she goes behind the blanket and plops on the cot
she sits on the edge debating what to do feeling herself trapped
her impulse is to leave if only to show this smart aleck hes not dealing with a child and she rises impetuously and moves to the window
a close view at the window shows her looking out
the downpour has not abated one bit and the heavy raindrops clatter against the window pane in a sort of challenge to ellie whose jaw drops
she turns slowly back to the room and as she does so her eyes light on the cot
it looks most inviting after all she hasnt had any rest for two nights
she falls on the cot again her shoulders sagging wearily
following this the view reveals both sides of the blanket
peter is already in his pajamas
still with me brat
there is no answer from ellie dont be a sucker
a nights restll do you a lot of good
besides youve got nothing to worry about
the walls of jericho will protect you from the big bad wolf
a close view shows ellie glancing over at the blanket
despite herself the suggestion of a smile flits across her face
you havent got a trumpet by any chance have you
peter gets the idea and smiles broadly
not even a mouth organ
pulling the covers back he prepares to get into bed humming as he does so
humming to himself whos afraid of the big bad wolf the big bad wolf the big bad wolf
louder shes afraid of the big bad wolf tra la la la la he springs into bed ellie smiles and wearily she pulls her hat off her head
she sits this way a moment thoughtfully then determined she looks up
do you mind putting out the light
not at all
he leans over and snaps it off the room is thrown into darkness except for a stream of light coming in the window from the night light outside the camp
visible are peters face and arms as he stares ceilingward while on ellies side all we can see of her is her silhouette except for such times as she gets
in direct line with the window
there are glimpses of her as she moves around in the process of undressing and we see or rather sense her dress dropping to the floor
she now stands in her chemise this being white silk it stands out more prominently against the darkness
she picks up the pajamas and backs into a corner following which a close up of her head and shoulders shows her glancing apprehensively toward peters side of the room
and holding the pajamas in front of her with one hand with the other she slips the strap off her shoulders
she flings her slip over the blanket
peter on his side of the room looks toward the blanket and reacts to the slip coming into sight
then other undergarments join the slip on the blanket
hoarsely do you mind taking those things off the walls of jericho
a pause its tough enough as it is
oh excuse me
and we see the underthings flipped off the blanket
ellies side of the room appears showing her crawling quickly into bed pulling the covers over her and glancing apprehensively in peters directionfollowing which a close view shows peter being
very conscious of her proximity
the situation is delicate and dangerous the room is atingle with sex
he turns his gaze toward the blanket
the view moves to the blanket remaining on it a moment
it is a frail barrier
the view then moves back to peter whose eyes are still on the blanket his face expressionless
a close view of ellie next shows that she too has her eyes glued on the blanket a little fearfully
she turns her head and gazes at the ceiling for a moment
then suddenly her eyes widenand she sits up abruptly
seriously oh by the waywhats your name
seen close turning his head toward her whats that
both sides of the blanket coming into view who are you
why im the whippoorwill that cries in the night
im the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face
interrupting youve got a name havent you
i got a name
i dont like it
dont let it bother you
youre giving it back to me in the morning
flopping back on her pillow as she mumbles pleased to meet you mr
the pleasure is all mine
there is silence between them for a few seconds
ive been thinking about you
youve had a pretty tough break at that
twice a missus and still unkissed
ellie doesnt like the implication and glares in his direction as peters voice continues meaningly ill bet youre in an awful hurry to get back to new york arent you
hard goodnight mr
she turns over goodnight
he also turns his head toward the wall and the scene fades out
part five a long view of the sky in the early morning fades in
in the dim distance there is a speck which as it comes nearer turns out to be an airplane
the drone of its motors becomes louder and louder
then the view cuts to the control cockpit of the plane revealing shouting to other the old mans screwy
who cant hear him whats at
louder i said the old mans screwy
nodding his head in agreement yeah
cupping his mouth the dames too smart for him
nodding again then leaning over howd you like to be married to a wild cat like that
the first pilot grimaces in disgust grabs his nose between his fingers and goes through the motion of ducking under water
and as they both laugh the scene cuts to the cabin of the plane a privately built plane which has all the equipment of a passenger ship
andrews and one of his secretaries a conservative appearing man of middle age lean over a table
this being a closed cabin the roar of the motors scarcely interferes with the dialogue
heres another wire sir
this ones from charleston
as there is a close view of the two checking every northbound train
also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways
no success yet
will continue to do everything possible
signed lovington detective agency charleston
holding up stack of wires theres a report here from every state along the east coast
want to hear them
impatiently what do they say
theyre practically all the same sir
he shrugs his shoulders to indicate there is no news muttering amateurs
theyre the finest detective agency in the country sir
andrews doesnt answer him
he puffs furiously on his cigar glances out of the window and turns irritably to a phone by his side
he snaps up the receiver and presses a button following which the scene cuts to the control cockpit where a light flashes on the instrument board and the pilot picks
up the receiver
seen in the cabin i thought i made it clear i was in a hurry to get to new york
bellowing what are we crawling for
in the control cockpit the pilot reacts to the complaint and glances at his speed indicator
we then see the speed indicator registering miles an hour
the pilot looks aghast
yelling into phone weve got her wide open sir
irascibly well step on it
step on it
he bangs up the receiver and stares moodily out of the window
it is plain that he is worried
the view then includes his secretary henderson
i hope shes all right sir
sharply of course shes all right
what do you think can happen
intimidated nothing sir
then shut up about it
thereupon the view cuts to a close up of an airplane motor in rapid motion and this dissolves to the auto camp cabin next morning a close view showing ellie
but the drone of the plane overhead disturbs her and she moves restlessly
murmuring in her sleep darn planes she squirms around uncomfortably and finding it impossible to resume her slumber opens her eyes
the sun pouring in through the window causes her to squint
she sits up and stares outside puzzled
then remembering where she is she looks toward the other side of the cabin listening for some sign of life
but there is none
and she relaxes
she falls back on the pillow pulling the covers over her
now peter enters from the outside with an armful of foodstuffs which he dumps on the table
he looks toward ellie
heyyou not up yet
come oncome on
what time is it
he goes to the blanket which hangs between the two cots and throws something over it to ellie
here catching the package what is it
opening the package why its a toothbrush
noticing her dress hanging freshly pressed youyou had it pressed
getting things ready for breakfast come on
breakfastll be ready in no time
why you sweet thing you
whered you get it pressed
at this the view moves with him and he goes to the blanket listen bratim going to count to ten
if youre not out of bed by then im going to yank you out myself
a close view of ellie shows her being stubborn but alarmed
counting quickly onetwothreefourfive panic stricken why you bully
i believe you would
sixseveneightnine screaming im out
and she jumps out of bed throwing the cover around herself following which peter is seen going back to the table
youll find the showersand thingsright back of the second cottage
at this ellie sticks her head over the blanket aghast outside
all the best homes have em outside
i cant go out like this
i have no robe
he flings his robe over to her and she disappears behind the blanket
but make it snappy
now ellie has got into his robe and appears on his side
the robe is too large for her and she makes a comical figure
as she enters she tries to maintain her customary dignity
dignifiedly whered you say the showersand thingswere
peter turns when he sees her he laughs appraisingly heyyoure little arent you
where is the shower
your hairs cute like that
you should never comb it
leaving haughtily ill find it myself
she slams the door viciously but peter rushes over to the window to watch her and as viewed by him ellie appears next walking to the showers outside the cabin
she holds her head high and struggles valiantly to maintain as much dignity as she can muster under the circumstances
then in the cabin at the window peter watching ellie chuckles at her shaking his head in amusement
he starts toward the table and the scene cuts to a moving view outside
the cabins with ellie walking past several cottages on her way to the showers
several people stop to stare at her until she reaches her destination
there are two wooden shacks adjoining each having a sign on them one reads showersmen the other showerswomen
in front of the womens shower there are several unappetizing looking fat women waiting and with them is a small girl
ellie crosses over to the womens shower and disappears inside the waiting women staring at her puzzled
a moment elapses and ellie backs out being pushed by a woman part of whose naked body is visible and whose voice is heard in protest cant a body have
some privacy around here
the women who are waiting chuckle at ellies embarrassment as she stands aside
they certainly are making a monkey out of her decorum
the little girl keeps eyeing ellie fascinated
pointing dont she look funny mama
ellie wheeling on the little girl crushes her with a devastating look so that the little girl cringes against her mothers skirt
ellie goes to the end of the line to await her turn following which close ups show the little girl slowly turning her head to look at ellie and ellie
noticing the little girl staring at her whereupon ellie sticks her tongue out at her
and in a scene which includes both the little girl retaliates by sticking her tongue out also
this dissolves to a view of ellie coming out of the showers
at the same time shapeley comes out of the mens shower and upon seeing ellie his face lights up
ellie ignores him and walks toward her cabin
but shapeley falls into step with her
sorry about last night
didnt know you were married to that guy
shoulda told me about it right off
he chuckles there i was gettin myself all primed for a killin and you turn out to be an old married woman
the scene cuts to the door of peters cabin as peter comes out stands in the doorway and is surprised to see ellie and shapeley who are then seen from
his angle talking
thereupon peter is seen again as his lip curls up a little jealously he returns to the cabin following which we again see ellie and shapeley walking
he notices the robe she is wearing and he looks down toward her feet the view moving down to show ellies legs and feet
the pajama legs are seen protruding below the robe the cuffs of which she has turned up
then the view moving back up to ellie and shapeley he lifts her robe playfully
hey whats this
wearing papas things
now thats cute
thats what i call real lovey dovey
stoppingher eyes blazing if you dont get out of here ill slap that fresh mouth of yours
startled sorryi didnt mean to sharply get out
i was just trying to make conversation
ellie leaves him abruptly and the scene cuts to the cabin where peter is now busy setting the small table
ellie enters after a moment while peter has his back to the door
without turning high time you got back
i met some very interesting women at the showers
we got to chatting about this and that
you know how time files
she disappears behind the blanket following which we see peters side of the cabin while ellies voice continues from behind the blanket
we must come back to this place often
you meet the nicest people
her head bobs up over the blanket now and again as she dresses
i saw the little pussinfoos girl
shes turned out quite a charming creature
peter ignores her chatter except for an annoyed glance once in a while
very outspoken too
said i looked funny
wasnt that cute
hurry up and get dressed
sticking her head over blanket why peter
dont you want to hear about our lovely friends
if you didnt waste so much time on that wise cracking drummerwed have been through with breakfast by this time
a close view shows ellie in the process of buttoning her dress
she looks up having recognized a tinge of jealousy in his voice which intrigues her
she starts to the other side of the blanket
then we see her joining peter in his part of the cabin
well i hope youre not going to dictate whom i can talk to
i know a couple of truck drivers id like to have you meet sometime
setting a plate for her come on sit down
sitting down to the table referring to the food my my
one eggdoughnutsblack coffee

sweetly why you dont have to apologize mr
youll never know how much i appreciate all this
gruffly what makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning
must be the spring
i thought maybeuh believe you me told you a couple of snappy stories
he apologized for last night
carelessly said he didnt know we were married
passing her a doughnut just shows you how wrong a guy can be
embarrassed you think this whole business is silly dont you
i mean running away and everything
its too good a story
yes you do
you think im a fool and a spoiled brat
perhaps i am although i dont see how i can be
people who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way
i never have
on the contrary ive always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom
would you believe it
this is the first time ive ever been alone with a man
its a wonder im not panic stricken
youre doing all right
nurses governesses chaperones even body guards
oh its been a lot of fun
one consolation you can never be lonesome
it has its moments
it got to be a sort of game to try to outwit fathers detectives
ii did it once actually went shopping without a body guard
it was swell
i felt absolutely immoral
but it didnt last long
they caught up with me in a department store
i was so mad i ran out the back way and jumped into the first car i saw
guess who was in it
kingking westley was in it
is that how you met him
we rode around all afternoon
father was frantic
by oclock he was having all the rivers dragged
she has been dunking her doughnut throughout this peter watching her say where did you learn to dunk in finishing school
indignantly aw now dont you start telling me i shouldnt dunk
of course you shouldnt
you dont know how to do it
dunkings an art
dont let it soak so long
a dip and plop into your mouth
if you let it soak so long itll get soft and fall off
its all a matter of timing
i ought to write a book about it
just goes to show you
twenty millions and you dont know how to dunk
id change places with a plumbers daughter any day
but before he can answer they are interrupted by voices directly outside their window and the view moves with peter as he goes to the door which he opens slightly
thereupon dyke is seen in conversation with two men outside the cabin
protesting loudly you cant go around bothering my tenants
i tell you theres no girl by that name here
besides how do i know youre detectives
show him your credentials mac
ill look around
at this peter closes the door and turns to ellie
petrified thats father at work whatll i do
appealingly to him peter whatll i do
dont look at me
i didnt marry king westley
ellie runs around the room picking up her stuff and murmuring oh my goodness
she reaches the window
now seen close at the window maybe i could jump out of the window
tremulously do you think theyd see me
suddenly come here you little fool
she starts toward him
we then see him plunking her in a chair sit down
he rumples her hair and sticks a few hairpins in her mouth
he now stands aside and deliberately talks loud enough to be heard outside
practically shouting yeah
i got a letter from aunt betty
she says if we dont stop over at wilkes barre shell never forgive us
a close up showing her staring at him in bewilderment what are you talking about
at this peter rushes over to her and clamps his hand over her mouth
with his hand over her mouth the baby is due next monthand they want us to come
ellie looks up at him and realizes what hes doing she nods to him that its all right whereupon he removes his hand from her mouth
and now one of the detectives approaches the front door of the cabin
when he hears peters voice he stops to listen
she says she saw your sister ethel the other day and shes looking swell
the detective knocks on the door
at this we again see inside of the cabin as peter whispers to ellie to say come in
calling come in
the moment she does peter rushes behind the hanging blanket
he has his head stuck over it waiting for the detective to enter and the moment the door opens peter ducks
the detective takes a step inside the room
from behind blanket i hope aunt betty has a boy dont you
shes always wanted a boy
i think well stop over in wilkes barre this trip darling
give the family a treat
a close view shows ellie and the detective
they have been staring at each other
very sweet calling to peter theres a man here to see you sweetheart
appearing from behind the blankets pleasantly want to see me
who hasnt taken his eyes off ellie whats your name
innocently are you addressing me
whats your name
stepping in front of him hey wait a minute
youre talking to my wife
you cant walk in here andwhat do you want anyway
were looking for somebody
well look your head offbut dont come bustin in here
this isnt a public park
while peter has been speaking the second detective and dyke have entered
they walk over to peter the first detective and ellie
i got a good mind to sock you right in the nose
take it easy son
take it easy
crowding forward whats up
the second detectives eyes fall on ellie and he stops to stare at her suspiciously
he takes a photograph out of his pocket which he inspects
explains these men are detectives mr
shouting i wouldnt care if they were the whole police department
they cant come in here and start shooting questions at my wife
appearing very domestic dont get excited peter
they just asked a civil question
turning on her very sarcastic there you go again
how many times did i tell you to stop butting in when i have an argument
sharply entering into the spirit of the pretense well you dont have to lose your temper
mimicking her you dont have to lose your temper
in his own voice thats what you told me the last time too
every time i step in to protect you
at the elks dance when that big swede made a pass at you he didnt make a pass at me
i told you a million times
the two detectives and dyke are seen watching the other two who are now out of sight
screaming oh no
i saw him
he kept pawing you all over the dance floor
you were drunk
now seen with ellie oh so now i was drunk
well you were
im sorry i didnt take another sock at him
yeah and gotten yourself arrested
youre just like your old man
once a plumber always a plumber
there isnt an ounce of brains in your whole family
starting to cry peter warne youve gone far enough
i wont stand being insulted like this another minute
ellie goes over to her cot and starts picking up her hat and things whereupon dyke very much affected turns to the detectives
now look what youve done
apologetically sorry mr
but you see were supposed to check up on everybody
were looking for a girl by the name of ellen andrews
you knowthe daughter of the big wall street mug
a close up of ellie appears as their voices are heard
your wife sure looks like her
dont she mac
she sure does
the entire group coming into view well i hope you find her
to ellie quit bawling
the detectives start out accompanied by dyke who is still concerned about the disturbing of his tenants
as they disappear out the door we hear dykes voice i told you they were a perfectly nice married couple
their voices die
peter stands in the middle of the room watching them go
from her side where she has been stalling ellie peers out of the window until the detectives vanish
she starts toward peter
then they appear together both staring out until the detectives are well out of sight
finally peter closes the door and turns to her
seriously itll be a dirty trick on aunt betty if it turns out to be a girl after all
this brings laughter from them both
but peter suddenly sobers and he looks at her thoughtfully
say you were pretty good
jumping in like that
got a brain havent you
you werent so bad yourself
we could start a two person stock company
if things get toughwe can play some small town auditoriums
well call this one the great deception
next week east lynne
after that the three musketeers
he strikes a pose id make a great dartagnan
how about cinderellaor a real hot love story
no mushy stuff
im running this troupe
fighting oh you are
who made you the manager
it was my idea wasnt it
you always want to run everything
if you dont like it you can resign from the company
i refuse to resign
then ill fire you
ill do all the parts myself
they are interrupted by the door being flung open
dyke sticks his head in the door
your bus leaves in five minutes
we havent started to pack yet
and they both scurry around throwing things carelessly into peters suitcase as the scene fades out
part six gordons office fades in and gordon is at his desk as his secretary enters
heres another wire from peter warne
throw it in the basket
as the secretary starts to do so whats it say
reading have i got a story
its getting hotter and hotter
hope youre the same
gordon snatches the wire out of her hand and tears it viciously into bits
dont accept any more
the scene dissolves to andrews new york officea richly appointed place awe inspiring in its dignified furnishings which shriek of wealth
andrews paces back and forth in back of his desk
sitting before him is a man of fifty with very rugged features
he is lovington head of the detective agency bearing his name
when the scene opens andrews is holding forth three days
three whole days
and what have you accomplished
in a close view at the desk all youve shown me is a stack of feeble reports from those comical detectives of yours
i want action lovington
we cant do the impossible mr
what im asking isnt impossible
my daughter is somewhere between here and miami
i want her found
ive put extra men on all along the way
its not enough
suddenly are you certain shes not with king westley
hes been trailed twenty four hours a day since this thing started
he cant even get a phone call we dont know about
who has been pressing several buttons on his desk im worried lovington
after all something might have happened to her
he is interrupted by the entrance of several employees yessir
seeing them oh clarkwant you to arrange for a radio broadcastright awaycoast to coast hook up
offer a reward of ten thousand dollars for any information leading to her whereabouts
send the story out to the newspapers
he rips a picture of ellie on the desk out of its frame some of the out of town papers may not have a picture of her
herewire this to themi want it to break right away
as he hands the picture to brown the view moves in to a close up of the picture which dissolves to a close up of the same picture in a
newspaper and as the view draws slowly back we see the headline over it which reads the view then draws back to reveal shapeley reading the newspaper
he stares long and absorbedly at the picture
then slowly he turns his head toward the rear of the bus and the view following his gaze passes a group of men singing the man on the flying trapeze
they are huddled together and accompanied by a man who plays a guitar
then the view continues moving until it reaches peter and ellie who join in the song and a close up of ellie shows her eyes sparkling as she sings gaily
shapeley looks back at ellie and apparently comes to the conclusion that his suspicions are correct for he quickly folds the newspaper casting a surreptitious glance around to make certain
he is not being watched
a diabolical smirk spreads over his face
a full view of the interior of the bus shows most of the occupants joining in the fun singing
they seem unmindful of the discomfiture caused by the rocking of the bus which throws them against each other
then the view draws in to a front seat in which sit a woman and a small boy of ten
the womans face is haggard and she sways
uncertainly her eyes half closed
her small sons frightened face peers up at her
in a trembling voice whatsa matter ma
dont you feel all right
the woman struggles valiantly to recover her composure
she presses her sons small hand in a feeble effort at assurance
a close view of ellie and peter shows ellie singing more boisterously than the rest doing the comical song with exaggerated gestures
but suddenly her face clouds at something she sees
touching peters arm peter
as he turns theres something the matter with that woman
she looks ill
peter follows her gaze whereupon we see the woman
her head rolls weakly a pained expression on her face
again seen with peter sympathetically i better go over and see her
dont be silly
nothing you can do
must be tough on an old womana trip like this
we see the other passengers around ellie and peter enjoying themselves
one of them pokes her
hey galli curci come onget onto it
poking peter you too mccormack
ellie and peter snap into it they are just in time for the long wail which precedes the chorus singing o o o ohhe flies through the air with the
greatest of ease this daring young man on the flying trapeze at this the scene cuts to the road
the bus is caught in a muddy road full of ruts and at the moment wavers dangerously at an angle
the left front wheel is stuck in a deep hole and the engine roars and clatters as the driver feeds the gas
finally the bus moves forward extricating the wheel but just as it does the right front wheel falls into another mud hole on the other side and this time the
bus seems hopelessly stuck a close up of the right wheel showing it revolving desperately but in vain
the mud splashes in all directions and the wheel seems to sink deeper and deeper
thereupon this view cuts to the inside of the bus
is tilted over at an extreme angle which has thrown ellie into a corner on the floor where she now crouches in an undignified position
she looks like a turtle her head being invisible
sticking her head out thank the man for me peter
this is the first comfortable position ive had all night
peter amused is assisting her to her feet
the guitarist has continued his playing uninterrupted and as peter lifts ellie he sings singing she flies through the air with the greatest of ease
this darin young maid on the flying trapeze grunting her movements are gracefulall men does she please a close view of the woman and the little boy now shows the
latter terrifiedly watching his mother whose head sags wearily
finally she topples forward in a swoon
with a moan ma
whatsa matter with you
tears stream down his cheeks somebody help me
somethins happened to her
the music stops abruptly
everyone looks up startled
ellie starts forward followed by peter
passengers closely group around the woman and chatter
look how pale she is
peter and ellie step up
get some water somebody
to the boy let me get in here son
ellie goes out of sight to get water
the boy cries audibly terror stricken but gets out of peters way and peter lifts the woman up and stretches her across the seat
ellie comes back with water which she silently hands to peter who administers to the woman and when she slowly opens her eyes makes her drink the water
the woman looks around bewildered
consolingly thats better
youre all right now
just took a little nose dive thats all
he assists her in sitting up
the boys wailing is heard and he now rushes over and throws his arms around his mother
crying maoh gee ma
his mother clings to him but still feeling faint her head sways
peter looks up at ellie and gives her a sign to sit down beside the woman
ellie sits down beside her
peter takes the boy by the shoulders
come on son
better give your mother a chance to snap out of it
as the boy emits a heart breaking sob its all right son
shell be okay in a couple of minutes
he leads the boy away while ellie places her arm around the woman
youd better rest
its been a hard trip hasnt it
the scene cuts to a close view of shapeley who has his eye peeled on peter watching him and we next see peter and the boy who is still sobbing
they are now standing away from the other passengers
we aint ate nothin since yestidday
what happened to your money
ma spent it all for the tickets
she didnt know it was gonna be so much
with a new outburst we shouldna come i guess but ma said theres a job waitin for her in new yorkand if we didnt go she might lose it
going without food is bad business son
why didnt you ask somebody
i was gonna do it but ma wouldnt let me
she was ashamed i guess
peter reaches into his pocket for a bill just as ellie approaches them
shell be all right soons she gets something to eat
peter has extracted a single bill and dips in his pocket for a smaller one
before he can find anything however ellie takes the one he has in his hand and gives it to the boy
here boyfirst town we come to buy some food
peter glances at the empty hand and then at ellie i shouldnt oughta take this
mall be angry
confidentially just dont tell her anything about it
you dont want her to get sick again do you
a sob in his voice no o
but i shouldnt oughta take the money
to peter you might need it
forget it son
rumples his hairsmiling i got millions
also smiling thanks
her arm around the boy come on
lets go back to your mother
she leaves with the boy peter watching her a moment impressed by her display of humanness before turning and leaving the scene following which a close up shot of shapeley
watching peter then also rising and starting out
on the road the driver is now standing in front of the mud hole staring at the sunken wheel dolefully as several people stray into the scene
that storm sure made a mess outa these roads
appearing and seeing the trouble holy smokes
youll never get out yourself
better phone for some help
phone for help
unhappily were right in the middle of nowhere
there isnt a town within ten miles of here
shapeley is just entering the outskirts of the group
he stops looks in the direction of peter speculatively
he has the newspaper stuck in his pocket which he caresses tenderly
the scene expanding peter is then seen leaving the group
as peter approaches whats up
looks like were going to be stuck for a long time
he starts away calling to him say buddy peter turns and looks at him quizzically and the two are then seen close together
like to have a look at my paper
he has taken it out and has it opened as he hands it to peter
the headlines concerning ellie and her picture shriek out at peter
this startles him for a moment but he manages to recover his poise
travelin like this you kinda lose track of whats goin on in the world
he glances from the newspaper to shapeley wondering how much he suspects if you wanna get anywhere nowadays you gotta keep in touch with all the news is what i
eyeing him expectantly thats right
pointing to paper take that story there for instance
be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers
non committally yeahwouldnt it
its a lotta dough
if i was to run across that dame you know what id do
id go fifty fifty with you
cause im a guy that dont believe in hoggin it see
a bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball is what i always say
whats on your mind
hard five gsor i crab the works
youre a pretty shrewd baby
looking around we better get away from this gang
talk this thing over privately
and the view moves with them as peter leads the way toward a clump of bushes off the side of the road shapeley following
they are concealed from the rest of the passengers
lucky thing my running into you
just the man i need
smiling broadly youre not making any mistake believe you me
i can use a smart guy like you
expansively say listen when youre talkin to old man shapeley youre talking to suddenly do you pack a gat
a close view of the two shows the smile dying on shapeleys face
he looks up quickly
feeling him got any fireworks on you
weakly whyno carelessly thats all right
i got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase
ill let you have one of them
shapeley is beginning to realize he is in for something he hadnt bargained for and stares speechlessly at peter who continues blandly expect a little trouble up north
may have to shoot it out with cops
the perspiration starts appearing on shapeleys brow as we see him in a close up
peters voice continues with emphasis if you come through all right your five gs are in the bag
ill talk to the killer see that he takes care of you
finally finding his voice the killer
seen with shapeley watching the latter to gauge the effect of his words yeahthe big boy the boss of the outfit
shakily youre not kidnapping her are you
tough what else stupid
you dont think were after that penny ante reward do you
contemptuously ten thousand bucks
were holding her for a million smackers
stammering say look
i didnt know it was anything like this seeand whats the matter with you
raising his voice pleadingly but im a married man
i got a couple of kids
i cant get mixed up with gripping his arm sh sh sh
soft pedal you mug
before i whatre you trying to do
tell the whole world about it
low and menacingly now listen youre in this thingand youre staying in
you know too much
frightened out of his wits i wont say anything
honest i wont
how do i know
he reaches into his coat threateningly i gotta good mind to plug you
arguing with himself i shouldnt take any chances on you
breaking down you can trust me mister
ill keep my mouth shut
he glares at shapeley a moment silently as if making up his mind whats your name
where do you live
orange new jersey
got a couple of kids huh
you love them dont you
sensing the threat horrified oh gee misteryou wouldntyou aint thinkin about threateningly youll keep your trap shut all right
quickly suresureill keep my trap shut
you can depend on me mister
if you dontever hear of bugs dooley
just like you
but he made a big mistake one day
got kind of talkative
know what happened
his kid was found in the bottom of the
a rock tied around its neck
he couldnt take it
blew his brains out
shapeley cant stand much more of this
he is ready to keel over gee
that musta been terrible
righteously i guess he had it coming to him though
but dont you worry about me
i dont talk
i never talk
take my word for it
gee i wouldnt want anything to happen to my kids
just remember that
now beat it
grabbing peters hand and shaking it gratefully oh thanks thanks mister
i always knew you guys were kind hearted
putting his hand away come on scram
and stay away from that bus
anything you say
as he says this he backs away from peter following which a close up of peter shows a twinkle in his eye and then as seen by peter shapeley appears
walking hurriedly away
when he thinks the distance is safe he starts running
he slips and falls in the mud picks himself up and continues his race for life
the scene dissolves to the road at night with ellie and peter walking along
it is apparent they have been trudging like this for a long time
poor old shapeley
you shouldnt have frightened him like that
at the rate he started hes probably passed two state lines by this time
the exercise is good for him
yes i noticed he was getting a little fat lately
she grabs her side ouch
whats the matter
grimacing i was never built for these moonlight strolls
protesting why did we have to leave the bus
i dont trust that chatterbox
the scene dissolves to the banks of a narrow stream at night
peter is bending over removing his shoes and we see the two closer as they talk
first town we hit in the morning you better wire your father
not as long as im alive
okay with me if you can stand the starvation diet
what do you meanstarvation
it takes money to buy food
why havent you
interrupting not a sou
i had some before the fainting scene
you didnt give that boy all your money
i didnt give him anything
you were the big hearted gal
how about wiring your father now
ill get to new york if i have to starve all the way
risinguttering a deep sigh must be some strange power westley has over you women
he now has his shoes off and ties them to each other how do you expect to get there
to new york
im following you
arent you afraid of me
looking at her okay
hang on to these
as he bends down in front of ellie he gets a firm grip around her legs and throws her over his shoulder like a sack
she squeals terrified but peter ignores this and with his right hand which is free he lifts the suitcase and starts walking across the stream
ellies first fright is gone and she now rather enjoys the sensation of being carried by peter
she lets herself go completely limp still clinging to his shoes which she carries by the string
as they walk the dangling shoes keep hitting peters backside
i wish youd stop being playful
thereupon holding the shoes out at a safe distance sorry
peter takes several more laborious steps before either of them speaks its the first time ive ridden piggy back in years
this isnt piggy back
of course it is
after a silence for several seconds i remember distinctly father taking me for a piggy back ride and he carried you like this i suppose
with finality your father didnt know beans about piggy back riding
another silence before she speaks again my unclemothers brotherhad four children and ive seen them ride piggy back
i dont think theres a piggy back rider in your whole family
i never knew a rich man yet who was a good piggy back rider
to be a piggy backer it takes complete relaxationa warm heartand a loving nature
and rich people have none of those qualifications i suppose
not a one
show me a good piggy back rider and ill show you somebody thats human
take abraham lincoln for instancea natural piggy backer
contemptuously where do you get off with your stuffed shirt family
turning why your father knew so much about piggy back riding that he in his excitement he wheels around to speak to her forgetting that as he turns she goes
not finding her at his right he swings around to his left
naturally he takes ellie with himand realizing his mistake he mutters aw nuts
he proceeds on his way walking faster than before
they continue this way silently for some time
finally ellie breaks the silence
persistently my father was a great piggy backer
peter raises his eyes heavenward in thorough disgust then calmly hands his suitcase to her
hold this a minute
ellie takes the suitcase from him and his hand now free he delivers a resounding smack on her backside so that ellie lets out a yelp
taking the suitcase thank you
the scene dissolves to the edge of a cow pasture at night and ellie and peter are revealed climbing under a barbed wire fence following which the scene dissolves to
a haystack in front
peter sets his bag down and surveys the layout ellie watching him
to himself this looks like the best spot
were not going to sleep out here are we
i dont know about you but im going to give a fairly good imitation of it
and he busies himself laying out a bed for her pulling hay from the stack and spreading it out on the ground
ellie wanders aim lessly and then moves to a rock where she sits and watches peter
after a pause coyly peter as a close view shows him still arranging her bed grumbling what
without looking up just your imagination
seen at the rock while peter is out of sight no it isnt
im hungry andand scared
you cant be hungry and scared at the same time
insisting well i am
as both he and ellie are seen in their respective places if youre scared it scares the hunger out of you
argumentatively not if youre more hungry than scared
impatiently all right
lets forget it
after a pause i cant forget it
im still hungry
tearing his hair screaming holy smokes
why did i ever get mixed up with you
this brings silence and he goes on building a bed for her
then a close up of ellie shows her watching him
her eyes soften
a very definite interest in him is slowly but surely blossoming and the fact that he is making her bed adds to the intimacy of the scene
a close view of peter shows him concentrating on his task but he pauses a moment and turns to glance at her
it is a devouring look which he quickly dispels by working more feverishly on her bed
muttering while he works if i had any sense id have been in new york by this time
he emphasizes his feelings by yanking viciously at the hay as both of them are now seen taking a married woman back to her husband
what a prize sucker i turned out to be
he has her bed ready without glancing at her come onyour beds all ready
she watches him a moment then rising slowly starts toward peter
then she stands over her bed surveying it speculatively
ill get my clothes all wrinkled
sharply well take them off
shouting all right
dont take them off
do whatever you please
but shut up about it
she flashes him a petulant offended glance but it is lost on peter who has his back to her and meticulously she slips to her knees and proceeds to stretch
out on the hay
the hay bed is bumpy and hard and she has quite a difficult time getting comfortable her efforts to do so are accompanied by painful sighs
a close view shows peter stopping to watch her and his look is sympathetic and solicitous
then while ellie groans and sighs and pounds the hay with her palm peter steps out of sight
ellie is unaware of his departure so busily occupied is she with her makeshift bedding
she squirms around unhappily and finally stretches out deciding to make the best of it
she lies on her back her hands clasped under her head looking up at the stars
seen close as she is lying back on hay bed youre becoming terribly disagreeable lately
snap my head off every time i open my mouth
she waits for a reply but receives none if being with me is so distasteful to you you can leave
independently you can leave any time you see fit
nobodys keeping you her
martyr like i can get along
she waits a second and then turns to see what effect this has on him
the fact that peter is gone doesnt quite register at first
she looks around calmly then is puzzled and finally she becomes panicky
she sits up with a start
murmuring frightened peter there is a pause while she listens but nothing stirs and there is more apprehension in her voice peter
real terror comes into her face and she is ready to cry
she gets to her feet
with a terrified outcry peter
at this he comes running into the scene under his arm he has a watermelon
whats the matter
relieved oh peter she throws her arms around his neck and sobs freely hoarsely whats got into you
clinging to him oh peter
i was so scared
with his free hand he removes her arm from around his neck and starts away
setting the watermelon down i wasnt gone more than a minute
just went out to find you something to eat
a sob still in her voice i knowbut
kicking the melon over to her here
eat your head off
i dont want it now
vehemently thought you were hungry
i wasbut but what
i was so scaredthat it scared exasperatedly holy jumping catfish
you can drive a guy crazy
he kicks the melon viciously out of sight and without any particular preparation or fuss he flops down on his bed following which ellie goes to her bed and lies
then a close view of ellie appears and at the moment she looks far removed from the spoiled pampered self reliant brat of alexander andrews
instead she is a helpless baby clinging to peters protective wing
shed be ever so grateful right now for a little civility on his part for a little tenderness and understanding and she glances over at him hopefully
peter however stares up at the stars dreamily and we then see ellie turning away from him disappointed
still the minute ellie turns her head peter looks at her out of the corner of his eye and its a long and steady gaze
then suddenly he gets an idea and rises
he finds his topcoat and goes to her
might get chilly later on
he spreads it over her better use this
as he bends down to tuck her in their faces are seen in close proximity
ellie tremulous and fearful has her eyes peeled on him
the situation is imminent with danger anything is likely to happen at this moment and she is frightened and expectantshe knows how weak she would be if he suddenly crushed
her in his arms
peter avoids her gaze
he too is a bit shaky
the temptation is there and his resistance is waning
he tucks her in and quickly turns away
ellies eyes however never leave him
immediate danger has vanished and it leaves her a little regretful
a close view of peter as he walks over to a rock and sits down shows him nervously taking out a cigarette and lighting it
youve had a lot of men crazy about you havent you
ellie doesnt respond
she has the scrutinizing speculative look of a girl who feels herself falling in love with someone who is practically a stranger to her as a result of which she
then a wider view includes both of them and we see that peter too fights valiantly against a mounting interest in this girl who epitomizes everything he dislikes
he creates the impression in the following scene that in his analysis of her he is trying to dissuade himself from something he is bound to regret
his attack on her consequently is overly vicious
i guess youve pretty much had your own way with them
thats your trouble mostly
youve always had your own way
thats why youre such a mess now
he pauses a second waiting for a protest but ellie offers none she is too much absorbed in her own confusing emotions
a close view then shows peter taking a long puff on his cigarette and exhaling the smoke watching it vanish before he speaks
suddenly you know what generally happens to people like you
you get your values all mixed up
you attach all the importance to the wrong things
right now for instance theres only one thought in your mindto get back to king westley
he waits for a reaction but a close view shows ellie absorbed and she remains silent
peters voice continues
comical part of it is it isnt what you want at all
in a couple of weeks youll be looking for the nearest exit now seen with her people like you spend all your life on a merry go round
i guess thats what makes you so dizzy
he rises and paces a few moments youre always chasing after something
at least you think you are
truth is youre just running away
emphatically from yourself mostly
cause youre miserable
you hate yourself
the worlds full of people like you
dont know what they want
do you know
after a pause nothing youd give two cents for
seen close try me
i just want to be let alone thats all
lifes swell if you dont try too hard
most people want to get a strangle hold on it
theyre not living
theyre just feverish
now appearing with her if they didnt get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values theyd find what they want
peace and calm
when you get right down to it whats all the shootin for will you tell me
after all you can only eat three meals a day only sleep in one bed looking up right now that hay feels pretty good to you doesnt it
sure it does
cause you were tiredand its the only thing around
you sound like a hobo
i only work when i have to
two years ago i got a notion and went to china
there was a war going on
after a while it got stale
i went down to tahiti
just lay on the beach for six months
what could be sweeter
doesnt sound very exciting
peter seen close looks at her for a long time before speaking i guess not
id have given odds it wouldnt mean anything to you
he goes over and flops down on his own side of hay there were moments when i had hopes
when iaw im wasting timeyoure destined to be a dope the rest of your life
contemptuously i pity you
he turns over with a finality that precludes any further discussion following which a close up of ellie reveals that her eyes are wide open staring thoughtfully up at the
the scene fades out slowly
part seven a road fades in
it is day now and peter and ellie are trundling along
ellie limps and wears an unhappy expression on her face
what are you thinking about
by a strange coincidence i was thinking of you
i was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy
whatd you say were supposed to be doing
well youve given me a very good example of the hiking strongly where does the hitching come in
amused at her a little early yet
no cars out yet
she spies a rock and heads for it
then we see her seated on the rock
if its just the same to you well sit right here till they come
peter comes over sets his bag down and prepares to wait got a toothpick
but ive got a penknife
he extracts one from his pocket which he snaps open hayin my teeth
she points to her front teeth and peter flicks the hay out of her teeth
there it is
better swallow it
were not going to have any breakfast
neednt rub it in
peter takes a carrot out of his coat pocket and starts nibbling on it ellie looks up at this whatre you eating
as peter smacks his lips with satisfaction its a wonder you couldnt get me something i can eat
you dont think im going around panhandling for you
he takes a bite best thing in the world for youcarrots
had a tough time getting them
if that farmer ever caught megoodnight
i hate the horrid stuff
while she speaks a car roars by at terrific speed
peter and ellie both jump up
i wish you wouldnt talk too much
we let a car get away
ellie goes back to her rock despondently what if nobody stops for us
oh theyll stop all right
its a matter of knowing how to hail them
youre an expert i suppose
going to write a book on it
called the hitch hikers hail
theres no end to your accomplishments
you think its simple huh
exaggeratedly oh no
well it is simple
its all in the thumb see
a lot of people do it waving like this
he shakes his head sadly but theyre all wrong
never get anywhere
im sorry for the poor things
but the thumb always works
different ways to do it though
depends on how you feel
for instance number one is a short jerky movement he demonstrates that shows independence
you dont care if they stop or not
cause you got some money in your pocket see
number two is a wider movementa smile goes with that onelike this
he demonstrates that means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmers daughter
you figured that all out yourself huh
oh thats nothing
now take number three for instance
thats a pip
its the pathetic one
when youre brokeand hungryand everything looks black
its a long movement like this demonstrating with a follow through
yeah but its no good if you havent got a long face with it
in the distance a car is heard approaching and ellie looks up quickly
excitedly here comes a car
alert now watch me
im going to use number one
keep your eye on that thumb baby and see what happens
peter steps forward into the road and does his thumb movement
the car approaches but speeds right by spreading a cloud of dust in peters face leaving him staring at the departing car nonplussed
thereupon ellie seen close glances up at him a satirical expression on her face
sarcastically im still watching your thumb
peter is still looking after the car
something must have gone wrong
i guess ill try number two
when you get up to a hundred wake me up
another car is heard coming and peter steps forward prepared to hail it
then this dissolves to a long view of the road as a stream of cars of every description speeds forward toward the camera and vanishes
the view moving in to the side of the road peter is seen still in the same spot
he waves his arms jerks his thumb indulges in all sorts of gyrations while ellie remains slumped on her rock completely worn out
now ellie watches peter out of the corner of her eye her face expressionless
peter continues his arm wavingbut slows down like a mechanical toy which has run out
he finally gets down to just thumbing his nose at the passing vehicles and then thoroughly wearied he flops down on a rock near ellie
i guess maybe i wont write that book after all
but look at all the fun you had
as he glares at her mind if i try
dont make me laugh
youre such a smart aleck
nobody can do anything but you
ill show you how to stop a carand i wont use my thumb
the scene widens as she rises and steps forward
whatre you going to do
mind your own business
she lifts her skirt to above her knees and pretends to be fixing her garter
her very attractive leg is in full display
almost instantly we hear the screaming and grinding of quickly applied brakes and peter looks up astonished
the scene wiping off we then get a closer view of ellie and peter sitting in the back of an open ford
it is a broken down rickety affair of the vintage
ellie grins victoriously up at peter who stares ahead of him glumly
you might give me a little credit
i proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb
why didnt you take all your clothes off
you could have stopped forty cars
we dont need forty cars
peter glares at her and ellies eyes twinkle mischievously following which we get a wider view which includes the driver of the car danker
he is a man of about thirty a heavy set loose chinned person at the moment he is singing an aria from some opera
he suddenly stops turning to ellie and peter in the back seat
so youve just been married huh
well thats pretty good
if i was young thats just the way id spend my honeymoonhitch hiking
y e s s i r
and for no reason except that he cued himself into it he bursts forth into song gustily
singing hiking down the highway of love on a honeymoon
hitch hiking down down down down the highway down
ellie and peter in the back of the car react to the noise danker makes
hey hey arent you afraid youll burn out a tonsil
me burn a tonsil
singing my tonsils wont burn as lifes corners i
giving up all right let it go
completing his last line turn
the scene dissolves to the front of a lunch wagon on a deserted road and dankers car drives into the scene and stops
then we see danker turning to ellie and peter
how about a bite to eat
quickly why i think that would be stopping her no thanks
were not hungry
sentimentally oh i see young people in love are never hungry
singing as he leaves them young people in love are very seldom hungry
people in love are very seldom hungry
when he is out of sight peter glares at ellie
what were you going to do
gold dig him for a meal
defiantly why not
eat a carrot
she starts out of car im going in and ask him grabbing her arm if you do ill break your neck
she looks up at his glowering face realizes he means it and wilts under his dominant gaze
lets get out and stretch our legs
peter gets out followed by ellie and they walk away from the car
both are silent
at the door of the lunch wagon then danker comes out and looks around furtively
ellie and peter as seen by him appear walking away following which the view moves over to the ford and drops down to a close up of peters suitcase
now danker looks about quickly and starts toward his car
he springs into the car steps on the starter and is off
ellie and peter hear the motor
they wheel around and their eyes widen in surprise
he flings his coat at ellie and dashes after the ford
he is then seen running after it when the car turns around a bend in the road
peter continues the pursuit
this scene wiping off the ford now makes its appearance around the bend and as it approaches peter is seen at the wheel
he looks like hes just been through a fight
and as peter rides in ellie comes running toward him
a note of great relief in her voice oh peter
are you all right
come onget in
noticing a gash in his cheek oh youve been hurt
theres a cut on impatiently come on
at this she runs around to get in the other side as she runs what happened
as we see them closer just a road thief
picks people up and runs off with their stuff
what a racket
by this time she is in the car whatd you give him for the car
a black eye
thereupon the car moves out of sight a close view shows peter and ellie driving along in the ford
peter looks ahead uncommunicatively
ellie glances up at him and it is plain that somethings on her mind
a little self consciously lookuhhow are theuhcarrots holding out
peter glances at her
he knows what a concession this is on her part and he smiles sympathetically
tenderly you dont have to eat the carrots
as she looks her surprise just passed a pond with some ducks in it
with a cry of joy darling
she reaches up and kisses his cheek and peter beams happily
looking worried havent much gas left in this thing
got to start promoting some
throwing her his coat better take the things out of the pocket of that coat
ought to be good for ten gallons
the scene fades out
part eight andrews study fades in affording a close view of king westley
he answers every description we have had of him
he is a stiff handsome stuffed shirt gigolo
he sits in a chair leaning on a cane his gloves loosely in his hand
the view then moves back to reveal andrews who from the opening of the scene is speaking as he paces around the room
i havent changed my mind westley i want you to understand that
i dont like you
i never have
i never will
thats clear enough isnt it
youve made that quite evidentwith all your threats of annulment
confident well it hasnt bothered me for a minute
ellie and i got married because we love each other
and shes proving it as far as im concerned theres going to be no annulment
hard youve got a good thing and youre hanging on to it huh
andrews smiles in a very superior manner all right you win
ill just have to get used to you
i admit im licked
but only because im worried
ive had detectives all over the country searching for her
ive seen thousands of photographs
fortune tellers nuts every crank in the country has written me
quietly havent slept one night this week
if i dont find her ill go crazy
i might have been able to help if it werent for you
ive been watched so closely i impatiently yes
well you can help now
i issued a statement yesterday that ive withdrawn my objections
begging her to come home
i havent heard from her
apparently she doesnt trust me
why should she
after all interrupting all right
thats why i sent for you
pointing to next room theres a room full of reporters out there
i want you to make a statementthat youve had a talk with methat weve reached an understandingthat if ellen comes home i wont interfere with your marriage
will you do that
if you really mean it i will
strongly of course i mean it
i dont care whom shes married to softly as long as i can get her back
he starts out as andrews opens the door a number of reporters enter
come in boys
this is myuhthis is king westley
westley rises he has a statement to make
how do you do
they group around him the scene dissolves to the side of a lonely road at night
first there is a close up of a newspaper headline which reads
magnate and aviator reconciled everything all right
come home darling says westley
then the view draws back revealing that the newspaper is in the hands of ellie who sits in the car alone gazing at the headlines
then peters voice is heard
all right brat
at the sound of his voice she is startled and she quickly folds the paper and throws it out of sight
she starts to get out of the car
as she scrambles out of the car just as peter comes up to her any luck
he finally agreed to let us have a room
what about money
talked him out of it
he thinks were going to stay a week
ill have to think of something before morning
im glad you think so
if you ask me its foolish
i told you theres no sense in our staying here tonight
we could make new york in less than three hours
i couldnt arrive in new york at three in the morning
everybodys in bed
after a pause okay
with a wave of his hand cottage number three
as they start toward it the scene cuts to the owners cabin
the owner of the auto camp and his wife are standing at window looking out
she is a hatchet faced shrew
he is meek and docile
there you gotrustin people again
how many times did i tell you he looked like an upright young feller to me ma
theyre all upright till they walk out on you
said he was gonna stay a week
worst comes to the worst we got his car for security
unconvinced i dont trust him
the scene cuts to the inside of a cabin not unlike the previous auto camp cabin in which peter and ellie spent a night
peters opened suitcase is on a chair over which he leans
ellie walks around puffing at a cigarette
without looking up well here we are on the last lap
ellie crosses to the window and stares out moodily
peter removes several things from his suitcase and lays them on the bed
there is a strained silence between them as both are lost in their own thoughts
a close view of peter as he putters abstractedly with the contents of his bag creates the impression that he empties it tonight rather ruefully
it somehow spells finis to their adventure
strangely tomorrow morning youll be in the arms of your husband
ellie seen close turns away from the window and looks at peter
she stares this way for a long moment before speaking
in a still small voice yes
youll have a great story wont you
dryly yeah swell
peter takes the rope out of his bag
it is the one used for the walls of jericho previously
he lays it aside and then remembering retrieves it
for a moment he holds it in his hand speculatively then turning proceeds to tack it up
the noise of the tacking attracts ellies attention and ellie again seen close turns and looks toward peter
is that the walls of jericho going up
the walls of jericho
at which she turns back to the window peter also seen close stretches the rope across the room and tacks the other side
then reaching for blanket we certainly outsmarted your father
he throws the blanket over the rope i guess you ought to be happy
there is no response from her a close view revealing that she quite obviously isnt happy
they are now separated by the blanket and peter gets her pajamas from his suitcase and throws them over the blanket
there is silence while peter starts undressing suddenly am i going to see you in new york
peter glances up at the walls of jericho and after a speculative pause speaks quietly
i dont make it a policy to run around with married women
a close up of ellie disclosing only her neck and shoulders shows her slipping out of her clothes
she pausesthen looks up
no harm in your coming to see us
at this ellies face falls this is a definite rebuff weakly wont i ever see you again
peter seen close is now getting into his pajamas
what do you want to see me for
ive served my purpose
i brought you back to king westley didnt i
his mouth screws up bitterly thats what you wanted wasnt it
ellie is already in bed staring up at the ceiling
peter have you ever been in love
peter crawls into bed
i probably did the world a great favor at that
got two pinheads out of circulation
he reaches over and lights a cigarette cupid thinks hes doing something when he brings two lovers together
what goods that
im bringing two pains in the neck together
i think ill start an institutionhang out a shingle
the view now widens to include both sides of the blanket
ellie doesnt hear a word of peters attack
she is too intent on her own thoughts
havent you ever wanted to fall in love
havent you thought about it at all
seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy
after a pause suresure ive thought about it
if i ever met the right sort of a girl id interrupting himself yeah but where you going to find hersomebody thats realsomebody thats alive
they dont come that way any more
ellies disappointment is apparent
seen close ive even been sucker enough to make plans
a long puff on his cigarette i saw an island in the pacific once
never been able to forget it
thats where id like to take her
but shed have to be the sort of a girl thatd jump in the surf with me on moonlight nightsand love it as much as i did
he loses himself in his romantic contemplations you know those nights when you and the moon and the water all become onewhen something comes over youand you feel that youre
part of something big and marvelous
sighing those are the only places to live
where the stars are so close over your head that you feel you could reach right up and stir them around
a close up of ellie at this point shows that she is affected by his stirring description of a heavenfrom which she is excluded as she listens to him continuing
certainly ive been thinking about it
boy if i could ever find a girl whos hungry for those things peter again seen close has disposed of his cigarette and now stares dreamily heavenward
im going to swim in the surf with herim going to reach up and grab stars for herim going to laugh with herand cry with her
im going to kiss her wet lipsand suddenly stopping he turns his head slowly sensing ellies nearness and the view drawing back to include ellie shows her standing at his
bedside looking down at him yearningly
then we see them close together peters face is immobile
ellie drops to her knees
fervently take me with you peter
take me to your island
i want to do all those things you talked about
peter stares at her lovely face
his heart cries out with an impulse to crush her in his arms
after a long pause hoarsely better go back to your bed
simply i love you
arguing with himself youre forgetting youre married
tensely i dont care
i love you
nothing else matters
we can run away
everythingll take care of itself
begging please peter
you cant go out of my life now
i couldnt live without you
in a choked voice oh peter sobbing she lays her head on his breast and throws her arms around him
all is quiet for a moment as ellies head rests on his breast while peter struggles with an overwhelming urge to pour out his heart to her
scarcely audible better go back to your bed
there is a lengthy pause neither of them stirs
then ellie slowly raises her tear stained face and gets to her feet
whispering im sorry
she turns and disappears behind the blanket
peter remains motionless
then a close view shows ellie as she gets into bed sobbing quietly
she hides her face in the pillow to suppress her sobs
it is the first time in her life that she has been so deeply hurt
a close view next shows peter reaching over for a cigarette which he lights
all his movements are thoughtful meditative
he leans back and stares at the ceiling until we see only the cigarette in his mouth as it emits slowly rising puffs of smoke
this dissolving the cigarette is seen to be burnt three quarters down a long frail ash hanging perilously on
peter is then seen as he removes the cigarette from his mouth and crushes it in a tray
he leans back on the pillow and for a moment he is quiet
then glancing over in ellies direction he calls to her
softly calling hey brat
a pause did you mean that
would you really go
he waits for a response but none comes
he tries again hey brat he listensall is quiet
he slips his covers off and crosses to the blanket and peers over it
she is asleep
her tear stained face rests on the pillow her arm extends over her head
it is a childlike posture
peter is watching her tenderly
he speculates whether to awaken her and decides against it
he starts away
peter tiptoes around the room for a few moments deep in thought
then as an idea which he has been turning over in his mind begins to take form he hastily begins dressing
the scene dissolving peter is seen completely clothed and starting for the door when he thinks of something
he turns back grabs his suitcase stops to throw a kiss to ellie and goes out into the night
thereupon the scene wipes off disclosing a gas station along the road at night
here peter is talking to a station attendant
all im asking is enough gas to get me to new york
the bags worth twenty five dollars
hesitatingly yeah but i got a bag
my wife gave me one for christmas
high pressuring him listen manill tell you what ill do
when i come back in the morning ill buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit
what do you say
looking at peters hat i aint got a hat what
i aint got a hat
promptly putting it on his head well you got one now
come on fill er up
while he is still talking the scene dissolves to a view of peter driving furiously a broad happy grin on his face following which several scenes wipe off in succession
denoting the passage of time scenes of peter driving at high speed causing several cows to amble out of the way of the car driving into the holland tunnel and of the back room of a speakeasy where peter stands in
front of a small desk upon which there is a typewriter
near him is a swarthy italian
thats fine tony
now get me a drink and make sure nobody disturbs me for half an hour
going out sure
as peter plants himself in front of the machine the scene dissolves to a close up of the typewriter carriage upon which are typed the words and thats the full
and exclusive story of ellen andrews adventures on the road
as soon as her marriage to king westley is annulled she and peter warne famous newspapermanand undoubtedly the most promising young novelist of the present erawill be married
the view drawing back peter re reads the last sentence smiles contentedly and as he yanks out the sheet the scene wipes off disclosing the outside of gordons office the
sign on the door reading officemr
gordons secretary is at her desk as peter breezes in
rumpling her hair hello agnes
better not go in
hell shoot you on sight
entering i havent been shot at for days
in gordons office gordon is at his desk
he looks up when peter enters
rising to his full height menacingly get out of here
advancing wait a minute gordoni quietly get out
peter reaches his side and grabs him by the arms

running after gordon as the latter starts out for heavens sake joestop being an editor for just a minute
he grabs his arm weve been friends for a long time havent we

gordon is affected by the sincere note in peters voice

shes waiting for me in an auto camp outside of philadelphia

self consciously a guy cant propose to a girl without a cent in the world can he
while peter has been speaking gordon stares into space thoughtfully
what a story
picturing it on her way to join her husband ellen andrews falls in love with alertgrabbing paper out of peters hand lemme see that a minute
he moves to his desk excitedly and peter a gleam of hope in his eyes joins him following which the scene cuts to the shack of the camp owner and
wife in the early morning
the owner is suddenly startled out of his sleep by the voice of his wife calling zeke
he looks up just as she rushes into the room
i told you
i told you you couldnt trust him
that feller last night thats who
he was gonna stay a week huh
well hes skipped
took the car with him too
we wouldnt have known a thing about it until morning if i hadnt took that magnesia
pulling at him come on get up dont lay there
lets do something about it
thereupon the scene cuts to the auto camp cabin affording a close view of ellie tossing restlessly in her sleep
suddenly there is a loud banging on the door and ellie startled awakens
the pounding continuing ellie looks around frightened
the door suddenly bursts open and the owner and wife enter
they both glance over at peters side
timidly looks like it dont it
suddenly he sees ellie heres the woman ma
full of fightglaring at ellie oh
in a close view at ellies bed as the owner and his wife come up to her timidlysitting up whats the matter

and the cars gone too
bewildered why hell be back
what makes you think so
he took his suitcase and everything
ellie is perceptibly startled by this piece of news kinda surprised huh
its just like i told you zeke
they aint married atall
there is a close view of ellie as the wifes voice continues uninterruptedly could tell she was a hussy just from the looks of her
ellie is lost in thought trying to adjust herself to the idea of peters leaving her like this
she scarcely hears what is being said
got any money
snapping out of her trance whyno
the three now seen together thenyoull have to git
yeah youll have to git

as zeke leaves the wife plunks herself in a chair grimly determined to wait until ellie gets dressed and out
can i use your telephone
i want to talk to new york
you aint gonna stick me for no phone calls
you can go down to the sheriffs office
the scene thereupon cuts to the exterior of the auto cabin as ellie emerges the wife standing in the doorway
in the foreground several people are scattered around the courtyard
one woman washes stockings under a pump
a man is changing the tire on his car
ellie comes down the steps and crosses the courtyard
shouting to her and listen next time better keep away from here
i run a respectable place
ellie does not turn but walks straight forward trying to maintain her poise
the people in the courtyard turn to stare at her and one of them snickers
the scene dissolves to gordons office as peter is pocketing the money
gordon is fondling the story
you saved my life
waving the story okay pete
he drops the story on the desk and escorts peter out his arm around his shoulder for my dough smiling youre still the best newspaperman in the business
they reach the door which peter opens
then they appear at the doorway
through the open door the secretary stares dumbfounded at their friendliness
and good luck
outside gordons office peter kisses the secretary as he passes through
all women are beautiful
he goes out gordon is immediately electrified into action
what a yarn
what a yarn
suddenly get me hank on the phone
gotta hold up the morning edition
while he speaks he dashes back to his desk
we then see him in his office
grabbing phone hank
hold the morning edition
break down the front page

during his speech his other phone has been ringing persistently
he has ignored it until now
he picks up receiver into the second phone yeah

he bangs up receiver and turns back to the first phone listen hank
dig out all the andrews pictures

the second phone rings impatiently but gordon ignores it with king westley in it
hes waiting at the church
big tears streaming down his face
his bride hasnt shown up
old man andrews is there
laughing his head off
you knownow snap into it
he bangs up the receiver and grabs the second phone speaking into it impatiently yeah
what is it
a close view of gordon as he listens shows his eyes widening with amazement
this cuts to a telephone booth where a reporter is seen speaking excitedly
she just phoned her father from an auto camp to come and get her
hes getting a police escort
westleys going along too
shes been traveling by bus
the moment she read that her father and westley made up she phoned in
back in gordons office gordon is seen still at the phone
you sure thats right

he hangs up the receiver and grabs the first phone put hank on
as the secretary hurries in get me a doctor
im about to have a nervous breakdown
she stares at him dumbly as he speaks into the phone hankforget everything i just told you
i was just having a nightmare
he hangs upand turns to agnes call up the police department
tell em to find peter warne

i want the dirty crook pinched
he picks up peters story and flings it viciously into the wastebasket
starting out yessir
two re write men come in passing agnes you want us
wheeling around yeah
shove everything off the front page
ellen andrews just phoned her fathershes coming home
the moment she heard the old man withdrew his objections she gave herself up
spread it all over the place
heres your lead love triumphant
step on it
gordon goes to his desk mumbling to himself
his eye lights on the waste basket containing peters story and he is about to kick it when he stops
he stares at it thoughtfully reaches down lifts it outruns through it hastilyand then stares into space deep in thought
the scene dissolves to an open road in the morning as peter flies over it in his ford
he beams happily
he passes a gasoline truck and waves cheerily to the driver
this dissolves to a close up of an auto siren accompanied by a prolonged wail then to a road that morning as four motorcycles two abreast speed forward followed by
a luxurious limousine which in turn is trailed by a car filled with reporters
next in the limousine andrews is seen in the back seat
he is accompanied by king westleyhendersonlovington and a police inspector
i knew she was safe
sighing certainly gave us a run for our money
but andrews is too overwhelmed with joy to listen to any of this anxiously cant you get them to go any faster
at this the inspector leans over to talk to chauffeur this dissolves to a deserted road peter at the wheel of his car
his high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing
singing i found a million dollar baby he is interrupted by the song of a meadowlark whistling its strange melody
peter listens to it a second time then answers its call by imitating it
the meadowlark whistles again and peter is highly amused
waving his handto the meadowlark okay pal
be seein you
just then the sound of sirens is heard in the distance
peter glances back and as the sirens come nearer he pulls over to the side of the road
there follows a full view of the road with peter in the foreground at the side as the police cavalcade whizzes by accompanied by the shrieking sirens
thereupon peter seen close gets an idea
to his ford come on dobbin old boy
we got a police escort
he applies the gas and shoots out of sight following which a full view of the road shows peters car trying to catch up with the parade
it outdistances him however and we see peter in the ford pressing his body forward to help the car make time
his foot pushes the accelerator down to the floor
but the police cars are now out of sight and peter gives up
seen close to the carwith exaggerated dramatics dobbin me lad
you failed muh
im afraid youre gittin old
thereupon the scene dissolves to a small town road where at the door of a sheriffs office a policeman is standing on guard
the reporters hang around in front of him
several yokels look on
the limousine and motor cycles are at the curb
and now in a closer view at the door the policeman on guard steps aside as the door opens and ellie her father and king westley emerge
king has his arm around her
the moment they appear in the doorway cameras click and several reporters surround them
will you make a statement miss andrews
was it an exciting experience
how did you travel
brushing them aside later boys later
see her at home
they cross the sidewalkto the waiting limousine as cameras click
the scene dissolves to a road with peter still driving
he is however as before in excellent form and is singing lustily
suddenly however his eyes widen and he pulls on his brake the car screeches and moansand comes to a stop
take it easy dobbin
remember your blood pressure
we find peter directly in front of a slow moving freight train
several hoboes stick their heads out of a car and peter waves to them
the hoboes look puzzled for a minute and then wave back
the view then swings over to an opening between the cars affording a flash of the police parade on the other side apparently on its way back
peter amuses himself by talking to an old flagman
better get that toy train out of here
im in a hurry
the flagman grins at him in reply
by this time the last car is in sight and peter gets all set to move
he stops however to wave to a couple of brakemen on the rear platform
in the meantime the motorcycles have started forward and the sirens begin their low moaning wail
peter attracted turns and over peters shoulder we see the parade starting
as the limousine
passes we get a glimpse of the inside
ellie lies back on king westleys shoulder
he has his arm around her as they pass out of sight
thereupon a close view of peter shows him reacting to what he saw
he turns his head quickly to stare at the disappearing car a look of astonishment and bewilderment in his eyes
slowly he turns his head forward staring ahead of him blankly he cant quite make it out
then gradually the significance of it all strikes himand his mouth curls up bitterly
the scene wiping off a series of newspaper headlines come into view this dissolves to the anteroom of a newspaper office
the place is alive with activity and copies of newspapers are lying around bearing headlines relating to the andrews story
peter a bewildered stunned expression on his face enters and crosses funereally toward gordons office
several people standing around look up
hi petedidya see this
ellen andrews is back
gonna marry that westley guy after allwhat a dame
what a dame
peter pays no attention to any of this
he reaches gordons door which is open
he walks directly past agnes and enters the office
she looks up at him puzzled
then in gordons office peter walks to gordons desk and lays the roll of bills on it
agnes enters watching him anxiously
gordons out back some place
seeing the money she looks up surprised see that he gets that will you agnes
tell him i was just kidding
he goes out as agnes stares after him puzzled gordon dashes in from a back door
you cant get a thing done around her unless peter warne was just in
left this money
said to tell you he was just kidding
looking at the money where is he
the scene cuts to the outer office and corridor as seen over gordons shoulder through the open door
peter is seen walking out
gordon hurries after him
at the sound of gordons voice peter turns and gordon comes over to him
just a little gag of mine
thought id have some fun with you
had me going for a while
wouldnt have made a bad story would it
but thats the way things go
you think you got a swell yarnthen something comes alongmesses up the finishand there you are
smiling wryly yeah where am i
slipping a bill in his coat pocket when you sober upcome in and see me
a whisper thanks joe
he leaves gordon watching him sympathetically and the scene fades out
part nine the lawn of the andrews estate fades in
it is morning and at the moment the place is a beehive of activity
dozens of butlers and maids hustle around setting tables
floral decorations are being hung by men on ladders
in the background on a platform a twenty piece orchestra is getting ready accompanied by the scraping of chairs adjusting of music stands unpacking of instruments
the scene cuts to andrews study king westley is seated and andrews walks around him
they are both dressed in striped trousers frock coat etc
well here we are its all set
youre finally going to be married properly
he waves toward the window with all the fanfare and everything
shaking his head i still dont know how it happenedbut youre going to be my son in law whether i like it or not
i guess youre pleased
why naturally i drily naturally
with vehemence youre going to become a partner in a big institution
its one of the largest in the world
you talk as if someday perhaps you might even take charge
a close view of andrews shows him looking around his study despairingly
murmuring the thought of it makes me shudder
confidently you might be surprised
i hope so
however thatll take care of itself
taking a new tack theres another responsibility youre taking on
one that im really concerned about
the two now seen again lightly ellie
oh shes no responsibility
say listenive devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat
toughest job i ever tackled
ever hear of j
biggest man in the country isnt he
well i tamed him got him eating out of the palm of my hand
ive browbeaten financiers statesmen foreign ministerssome of the most powerful people in the worldbut ive never been able to do a thing with her
shes been too much for me
im glad you think its easy
he bends over him now listenif youll do what i tell you perhaps i might develop a little respect for you
you never can tell
what would you like to have me do
a close view of king shows him looking up surprised as andrews voice continues
sock her at least once a day
do it on general principles
make her know youre the boss and never let her forget it
think you can do that
its quite an assignment try
do me a favor
its your only chance
and hers too
do that for meand maybe well be friends muttering maybe
he holds out his hand do we understand each other
taking his handrising yes sir
dismissing him fine
ill see you at the reception
he withdraws his hand which he looks at disgustedlythe result of a jellyfish handshake
oh by the way mr andrews i thought of a great stunt for the reception
as andrews looks at him quizzically im going to land on the lawn in an autogyro
what do you think of that
a close view of andrews shows him staring off at king in complete disgust
you thought that up all by yourself huh
unabashed why itll make all the front pages
a spectacular thing like that
hard personally i think its stupid
humoring a child but go ahead
have a good time
as long as ellie doesnt object
shell be crazy about it
well see you later
im going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space
holding out his hand goodbye
but andrews turns his back on him weve done that already
smiling yes of course
he turns and leaves andrews watching him go shaking his head sadly
i hope he breaks his leg
andrews starts out and the scene cuts to the hallway as andrews enters from the study
a maid coming down the stairs he calls to her ohmary yes sir
how is she
hesitantly whyuhshes all right sir
whats the matter
oh no sir
no different than yes
still in the dumps huh
if youll excuse me sirshe sent me for a drink
she leaves andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs following which the scene dissolves to the upstairs corridor in front of ellies door
andrews enters and knocks several times
receiving no response he gingerly opens the door
next andrews enters ellies bedroom and looks around
the view swings around the room following his gaze
it focuses on ellie who reclines on a sofa in her bridal outfit her head resting on the back
she stares moodily unhappily up at the ceiling
the view then expanding to include both father and daughter andrews is seen staring at her a moment sympathetically
he senses something is wrong
after a pause ellie jumping up with a start oh hello dad
a close view as he goes over to her i knocked several times
must have been day dreaming
to hide her confusion she reaches for a cigarette with forced lightness well everythings set
creating quite a furor too
great stunt kings going to pull
in a faraway voice stunt
landing on the lawn in an autogyro
noting her listlessness yes
personally i think its silly too
as he continues talking the view moves with ellie who wanders over to a window overlooking the lawn and stares out lost in thought
he goes over the ellie you look lovely
are you pleased with the gown
as ellie does not seem to hear him he becomes worried ellie
turning and looking at him blankly huh
it just penetrates ohthe gown distantly yes its beautiful
tenderly whats the matter ellie
she walks over to table and crushes her cigarette youve been acting so strangely since you returned
i havent bothered to ask you any questionsi waving his hand toward the lawn isnt all this what you wanted
receiving no answer from ellie you havent changed your mind about king have you
too quickly oh no
if you have it isnt too late
you know how i feel about him
but i want to make you happy
you gave me such a scareiwhen i couldnt find you
smiling feeblymeaning his heart you know the old pump isnt what it used to be
her hand on his arm sorry dad
i wouldnt hurt you for the world
you know that
she moves away from him and sits on the sofa and andrews watches her a moment and crosses over to her
he sits beside her placing an arm affectionately around her shoulder
tenderly elliewhat is it
arent you happy child
at this point she finally breaks and impulsively buries her face on his breast
after a pause hoarsely i thought so
i knew there was something on your mind
there are audible sobs from ellie therethere
they remain thus quietly for some time
finally andrews breaks the silence
what is it darling
receiving no answer you havent fallen in love with somebody else have you
as this brings an audible sob from ellie andrews lifts up her chin
looking into her eyes have you
ellie turns her head away a little ashamed of her tears ellie now rises and walks miserably away from him dabbing her eyes
andrews watching her realizes he has hit upon the truth
he walks over to her
i havent seen you cry since you were a baby
this must be serious
ellie is silent whered you meet him
on the road
trying to cheer her now dont tell me you fell in love with a bus driver
who is he
i dont know very much about him
in a whisper except that i love him
the great executive well if its as serious as all thatwell move heaven and earth to quickly itll do no good
wryly he despises me
oh come now he despises everything i stand for
he thinks im spoiled and pampered and selfish and thoroughly insincere
he doesnt think so much of you either
his eyes widening well
he blames you for everything thats wrong about me
thinks you raised me stupidly
smiling fine man to fall in love with
whispering hes marvelous
well what are we going to do about it
where is he
sadly i dont know
id like to have a talk with him
its no use dad
i practically threw myself at him
she shrugs futilely well under the circumstances dont you think we ought to call this thing off
no ill go through with it
but thats silly child
seeing how you feel why it doesnt matter
tired i dont want to stir up any more trouble
ive been doing it all my life
ive been such a burden to youmade your life so miserableand mine too
im tired dad
tired of running around in circles
hes right thats what ive been doing ever since i can remember
a close up of andrews shows him watching ellie as her voice continues
ive got to settle down
it really doesnt matter howor whereor with whom
seriouslyimpressed youve changed ellie
seen with andrews sighing yes i guess i have
sincerely i dont want to hurt anybody any more
i want to get away from all this front page publicity
it suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome
i cant walk out on king now
itll make us all look so ridiculous
she shrugs resignedly besides what difference does it make
inaudibly ill never see peter again
is that his name
she starts to walk away when she is attracted by her fathers surprise at the mention of the name
his hand has instinctively gone to his inside pocket noticing this why
do you know him
but andrews withdraws his hand
apparently he has changed his mind evasively oh nono
suddenly anxious you havent heard from him have you dad
obviously guilty why no
dont be silly
oh please dad she has reached into his pocket and has extracted a letter which she hurriedly opens and reads following which we see a letter in peters handwriting
it is addressed to alexander andrews wall street
it reads dear sir i should like to have a talk with you about a financial matter in connection with your daughter
ellie is then seen reading and re reading the note
her face clouds and then slowly changes to an expression of complete disillusionment
her voice strident looks like that was his only interest in me
taking the note from her im sorry you read it
are you going to see him
i suppose so
pay him off
hes entitled to it
he did an excellent job
kept me thoroughly entertained
its worth every penny he gets
she paces agitatedly andrews watching her silently
he knows what an awful blow to her pride this must be
mary now enters with a cocktail tray which she sets on the table
thats just what i need
she pours herself a cocktail mr
king westley is on his way up
have him come in
mumbling ill be going
he goes out behind mary ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another as king enters
upon seeing him well if it isnt the groom himself
youre just in time king
a close view of the two shows king taking her in his arms
how are you ellie
he gives her a kiss which she accepts perfunctorilybut he insists upon being ardent are you happy
releasing herself happy
why shouldnt i be happy
im getting the handsomest man in captivity
handing him a drink here you are king
she holds her glass out lets drink to us
she drains the glass pouring another as she continues we finally made it didnt we
you bet we did
its up to you now
i want our life to be full of excitement king
well never let up will we
never a dull moment
well get on a merry go round and never get off
promise youll never let me get off
its the only way to live isnt it
no time to think
we dont want to stop to think do we
just want to keep going
whatever you say darling
i heard about your stunt
thats swell king
just think of itthe groom lands on the lawn with a plane
its a perfect beginning for the life were going to lead
it sets just the right tempo
handing him a drink come on king
they both drink in andrews study andrews walks around the room perceptibly affected by his visit with ellie
he keeps turning peters letter over in his hand apparently debating in his mind what to do with it
he finally gets an ideaand determinedly crosses to the phone
then the scene cuts to a hotel room
first there is a close up of a newspapera tabloid bearing a heading which reads love interrupted romance of ellen andrews and king westley resumed as father yields
wedding reception to be held on andrews lawn
below this is a page of pictures and the view turns to each photograph
the first picture is of ellie and king on a beach
the title over the picture reads where they met
the second picture shows them in the cockpit of a plane the heading reading where they romanced
the next picture is of a small frame house with a shingle on it reading justice of the peace
over the photograph is a caption where they were married
the next picture is of the andrews yacht and the title reads where she was taken
finally the view moves down to the bottom of the page to a picture of ellie and king with her father between them in front of sheriffs office
caption reads where love triumphed
over these pictures the phone bell has been ringing
and now peter is seen staring expressionless at the newspaper
suddenly he becomes conscious of the phone ringing he looks upthen goes to it
into the phone hello
oh why cant i see you at your office
the scene cuts to andrews study affording a close view of andrews at the phone
i leave for washington tonight
may be gone several weeks
thought perhaps youd like to get this thing settled
this cuts to the hotel room where peter is at the phone
yeah but i dont like the idea of walking in on your jamboree
just between you and methose things give me a stiff pain
seen in his office you neednt see anybody
you can come directly to my study
id appreciate it very much if at his phone nono
what the deuce do i want to his eyes fall on something and there follows a close view of a tabloid newspaper featuring the heading love triumphant and containing the
pictures of ellie and king
the view then moves down to feature headline reading groom to land on brides lawn
king westley plans to drop in an autogyro on the lawn of andrews estate
peters mouth screws up disdainfully
into the phone yeah wait a minute
maybe i will come over
id like to get a load of that three ring circus youre pulling
i want to see what love looks like when its triumphant
i havent had a good laugh in a week
he is still at the phone as the scene dissolves then the lawn of the andrews estate dissolves in
it is now filled with guests who wander around chattering gaily
the orchestra plays
a captain of waiters in the foreground instructs his men
i want everything to be just so
when the ceremony starts you stand on the sidestill
no moving aroundno talking comprenez
the view cuts to a roadway leading to the estate and peter is seen driving up in his ford and squeezing in between two rolls royces
the uniformed chauffeurs glare at him
but peter springs nonchalantly out of his car
blithely as he passes them keep your eye on my car when youre backing up you guys
and as he goes the chauffeurs look at each other surprised
the scene dissolves to andrews study where a butler stands in front of andrews who is seated at his desk
show him in
the butler leaving a close view shows andrews reaching over and snapping on a dictograph concealed somewhere on his desk
the office coming into view again we see andrews rising and awaiting peters entrance
after a moment peter comes in removes his soft felt hat and tucks it under his arm
peter advances into the room looking around curiously
his air is frigid contemptuous as andrews studies him and he makes no move to sit
andrews waves to a chair and sits down himself
peter flops into the nearest chair
seen close with peter after a pause i was surprised to get your note
my daughter hadnt told me anything about you
about your helping her
thats typical of your daughter
takes those things for granted
too restless to sit he jumps up why does she think i lugged her all the way from miami vehemently for the love of it
please understand me
when i say she didnt tell me anything about it i mean not until a little while ago
she thinks youre entitled to anything you can get
bitterly oh she does huh
isnt that sweet of her
you dont i suppose
shrugging i dont know
id have to see on what you base your claim
i presume you feel youre justified in seen close now if i didnt i wouldnt be here
he reaches into his pocket ive got it all itemized
and he throws the paper on andrews desk andrews picks up the paper and glances at it
after a moment he looks at peter studying him interestedly then he returns to the paper and reads its contents cash outlay
andrews looks up from the paper
this is a twist he hadnt anticipated and he doesnt quite know how to handle it
now seen closer with andrews i sold some drawers and socks too im throwing those in
and this is what you wantthirty nine dollars and sixty cents
im not charging you for the time i wasted
yes i knowbut whats the matter
isnt it cheap enough
a trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars
let me get this straight
you want this thirty nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars
what ten thousand
sharply who said anything about a reward
smiling im afraid im a little confused
you see i assumed you were coming here for impatiently all i want is thirty nine sixty
if youll give me a check ill get out of this place
it gives me the jitters
youre a peculiar chap
irritably well go into that some other time
the average man would go after the reward
all you seem to listen did anybody ever make a sucker out of you
this is a matter of principle
something you probably wouldnt understand
he burns at the thought when somebody takes me for a buggy ride i dont like the idea of having to pay for the privilege
you were taken for a buggy ride
yeahwith all the trimmings
now how about the check
do i get it
a close up indicates that andrews has been studying peter throughout the scene
he is now completely won over
he opens a checkbook and writes it out while andrews writes peter wanders around the room in an attitude of bitter contempt
andrews rises and goes to him
here you are
as peter takes the check do you mind if i ask you something frankly
peter just looks at him without responding do you love my daughter
evasively while folding the check a guy thatd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined
thats an evasion
putting the check into a wallet she grabbed herself a perfect running mate
the pill of the century
pocketing wallet what she needs is a guy thatd take a sock at her every daywhether its coming to her or not
a close view of the two shows andrews smiling here is a man
if you had half the brains youre supposed to have youd have done it yourselflong ago
do you love her
going for his hat as he replies a normal human being couldnt live under the same roof with her without going nuts
going to the door shes my idea of nothing
i asked you a question
do you love her
snapping it out yes
as andrews smiles but dont hold that against me
im a little screwy myself
he snaps the door open and goes out following which andrews is seen watching the door his eyes twinkling and the scene cuts to the downstairs hallway as peter comes
through moving on to the front door
but just as he reaches it ellie enters accompanied by half a dozen men and holding a cocktail in her hand
they see each other almost simultaneously and both stop glaring
looking her over contemptuously perfect
now you look natural
at this ellie leaves her group and comes toward peter and a close view shows them together glaring at each other
icily i hope you got your money
you bet i did
same to you
why dont you stay and watch the fun
youll enjoy it immensely
but ive got a weak stomach
he wheels around and goes through the door ellie looking after him her eyes blazing
the drone of a plane motor outside is heard and several people rush down the stairs all excited
here comes king
hes just coming down
hurry up everybody
come on ellie
immediately there is a general excitement as guests hurry through the hallway on the way to the lawn
but ellen does not moveshe remains staring blankly at the door through which peter went until andrews enters from his study
i just had a long talk with him
her voice breaking im not interested
now wait a minute ellie sharply i dont want to hear anything about him
she walks away from him and andrews frustrated looks at her helplessly
thereupon the scene dissolves to a full view of the lawn
the orchestra is playing mendelssohns wedding march
the lawn is crowded with guests
in the background we see the autogyro idling
a closer view shows a small platform serving as an altar
over it there is an arbor of roses
back of the altar stands a minister ready
a reverse view reveals a long narrow carpeted pathway leading to the house
both sides are lined with guests who are murmuring excitedly
at the moment king westley and his best man are marching solemnly toward the altar
back of the altar we see a high platform upon which are several newsreel men who are grinding their cameras
the guests of whom close glimpses are caught are now peering over each others shoulders
king and his best man have reached the altar and the music of the wedding march comes to a stop
the orchestra leader is looking around apparently waiting for a signal
at the door of the house a very prissy middle aged man waves his handkerchief and nods his head to the orchestra leader
the orchestra leader acknowledges the signal by nodding his headturns to his menwaves his baton and the orchestra starts playing here comes the bride
the guests whisper to each other excitedly
a great deal of stirring takes place
the door of the house slowly opensand a parade of small flower girls emerges
they march taking each step carefully while they strew flowers along the path
they are well out of the way when ellie on the arm of her father appears in the doorway
a view of the guests shows that they cannot contain themselves
murmurs of here she comes and doesnt she look beautiful
the newsreel men on their platform behind the altar bestir themselves
this is what theyve been waiting for
ellie and her father seen close now make their way to the altar
ellies face is solemn and her jaws set
whispering out of the side of his mouth youre a sucker to go through with this
ellie glances at him out of the corner of her eyeand quickly turns forward again
that guy warne is o
he didnt want the reward
ellie keeps her eyes glued in front of her remaining expressionless
all he asked for was thirty nine dollars and sixty cents
thats what he spent on you
it was a matter of principle with himsays you took him for a ride
this registers on ellie and she raises her eyesbut her reaction is only slightly perceptible
a close view of a group of guests shows two girls looking enviously in the direction of the bride
whispering i wish i were in her shoes
she certainly is lucky
ellie and her father are seen again and andrews is still whispering to her
he loves you ellie
told me so
this brings a definite reaction which she quickly covers up
you dont want to be married to a mug like westley
at this there is a close view of westleythere is a satisfied smirk on his face
i can buy him off for a pot of gold and you can make an old man happy and you wouldnt do so bad for yourself
if you change your mind your cars waiting at the back gate
ellie gives no indication of her intentions
her face remains immobile
and now ellie and her father have reached the altar
the prissy man is placing them in position
the big moment has arrived
the guests are all atwitter
but a close view of ellie shows that she realizes that her fate is closing in on her
she looks around for a means of escape
starting the ceremony dearly beloved we are gathered together here in the sight of god and in the face of this company to join together this man and this woman
in holy matrimony
if any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together let him speak now or else hereafter forever hold his
king wilt thou have this woman to be thy wedded wife
so long as ye both shall live
ellen wilt thou have this man to be thy wedded husband so long as ye both shall live
then seen at the altar ellie makes her decision
she reaches down takes a firm hold on her train and pushing several people aside runs out of the scene
those at the altar look up surprised and the most startled of all is king himself
calling after her ellie
he starts to go after herbut finds andrews in his way while the outcries of the guests rise in chorus
wheres she going
on the platform the newsreel men a look of astonishment on their faces decide to follow ellie
get her mac
and as viewed by the newsreel men ellie is seen in the distance dashing through the gates
the guests stare dumbfounded
following this andrews and king are seen together in the crowd
helplessly what happened
blandly i havent the slightest idea
but his mouth twitches as he tries to keep from smiling
as king runs out of sight andrews gets out a cigar and lights ita happy smile on his face which he now doesnt try to conceal
outside the front gate ellie is seen in a fast roadster as she starts away with a plunge
her eyes sparkle
a crowd of people dash up headed by king
they stop dead when they see the car disappear
on the lawn the commotion runs high and the guests chatter their amazement
a close view of andrews shows him smiling with satisfaction
the scene dissolves to andrews office where andrews is regaling himself with a whiskey and soda
he is in a pleasantly inebriated mood when his secretary enters
as he picks up the phone that has started ringing dont want to talk todont want to talk to anybody
dont want to see anybody
but its king westley on the phone
into the phone hello my would be ex son in law
ive sent you a check for a hundred thousand
thats the smartest thing you ever did westley not to contest that annulment
thats satisfactory isnt it
well it ought to be
oh im not complaining
it was dirt cheap
as he hangs up dont fall out of any windows
placing a telegram on the desk theres another wire from peter sir
theyre in glen falls michigan
reading it whats holding up the annulment you slow poke
the walls of jericho are toppling
to the secretary send him a telegram right away
just say let em topple
this dissolves to the exterior of an auto camp very much like the other camps at which peter and ellie stayed
the owners wife is talking to her husband
funny couple aint they
if you ask me i dont believe theyre married
theyre married all right
i just seen the license
they made me get em a rope and a blanket on a night like this
what do you reckon thats for
blamed if i know
i just brung em a trumpet
puzzled a trumpet
you know one of those toy things
they sent me to the store to get it
but what in the world do they want a trumpet for
the scene moves to the cabin occupied presumably by peter and ellie
the windows are lighted
there is a blast from a trumpet and as the lights go out a blanket is seen dropping to the floor and the scene fades out
