brooks story by mark andrus angle on apartment doorway
as it opens and an enormously sweet faced elder woman steps out bungled up against the cold turning back to call inside to the unseen love of her long life
im just going to get some flowers dear
ill be back in twenty minutes
its tulip season today
im so happy
and now she turns and faces the hallway
her sweetness dissolves in a flash
replaced by repulsion and that quickly she has reversed herself and re entered her apartment
closing the door as we consider her vacated
in the hallway
unliked unloved unsettling
a huge pain in the ass to everyone hes ever met
right now all his considerable talent and strength is totally focused on seducing a tiny dog into the elevator door he holds open
come here sweetheart
sniffing at a particular spot on the hall carpeting
melvin lets the elevator door close and advances on the mutt who has ignores him
wanna go for a ride
the dog lifts his leg at the precise moment melvin lunges and picks him up with a decisive heft so that dog urine squirts the hall wall for a second
the dog sensing a kindred spirit starts to growl and bark
a malevolent tone youve pissed your last floor you dog eared monkey
the dog takes a snap at melvin but the man is much meaner and quicker than the dog he holds his snout shut with his hand and reaches for the
door of the garbage chute
ill bet you wish you were some sort of real dog now huh
this is new york
if you can make it here you can make it anywhere you know
you ugly smelly fuck
and with that he stuffs him in the garbage chute and lets go
we hear a fading series of pleading anoooos from the dog fade to nothingness
as another apartment door opens emitting the loud sounds of a party and simon nye early s
simon has been born and raised with gothic horror and its strange that what that stew of trauma has produced is a gifted decent man
he bolts into the hall
melvin is just about to enter his apartment
here good doggie
he notices melvin at the far end of the hall
as melvin turns have you seen verdell
whats he look like
melvin starts to walk back to his apartment door which is directly opposite simons
i mean my little dog with the adorable face
dont you know what my dog looks like
i got it
youre talking about your dog
i thought that was the name of the colored man ive been seeing in the hall
simon looks o
and sees his black friend
which color was that
like thick molasses with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food
simon has had it
frank sachs melvin udall
not missing a beat howre you doing
franks shows my work mr
i think you know that
overlapping simon youve got to get dressed
to simon what i know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me i dont give a fuck what or where you shove your show
are we being neighbors for now
to frank do you still think i was exaggerating
frank can only smile
definitely a package you dont want to open or touch
hope you find him
i love that dog
simon terminally non confrontational still finds himself compelled to turn back toward melvin
directly you dont love anything mr
simon closes his door leaving melvin alone in the hallway
i love throwing your dog down the garbage chute
melvin locks and unlocks and locks his door counting to five with each lock
he turns the lights quickly on and off and on five times and makes a straight line towards his bathroom where he turns on the hot water and opens the
scores of neatly stacked neutrogena soaps
he unwraps one begins to wash discards it goes through the process two more times
a group of party goers enters followed by a handyman holding verdell who looks and finds who looks up lights up and tears up as he moves quickly toward the
group and his dog
thank the good lord
where have you been
thinking the greetings for him he always liked me
as simon goes past him to take the dog from the handyman
jackie franks junior partner barking a laugh at the party goer verdell barking some love
as the others greet simon jackie directs the group inside
jackie lingers looking on affectionately as simon picks some awful sticky gunk from the dogs body
he puts verdell down to reach for his wallet the tiny dog yaps in protest
just for a second okay
the dog yaps no
simon delighted picks him up again
kissing him on the mouth look at him
where was little baby
smiling in the basement garbage bin eating diaper shit
simon reacts then notices the handyman tongue in cheek trying to suppress his amusement
go ahead john you earned your fun
looking at verdell how did he get down in the basement
i mean even if he got on the elevator how
maybe some nice neighbor shoved him down the garbage chute
he stares out
frank frustrated following
quiet safe just melvins voice reading aloud as he writes
somewhat in the dark she had confessed and he had forgiven
this is what you live for he said
two heads on a pillow where there is only the safety of being with each other
how she wondered could she find such hope in the most shameful part of her
he barely reacts as we hear a loud knocking at he reads
but melvins into it
his fingers flying as he reads
at last she was able to define love
udall id like to talk to you please
he almost has the rest of the sentence the meaning of love but the knocking throws him
son of a bitch pansy assed stool pusher
he burst from his chair
as simon hears melvin through the door and takes a step back
melvin throws open the door
he looks demonic
loud and angry yeeeess
maybe this can wait
frank signals encouragement as melvin opens the door
i found verdell mr
well thats a load off
melvin walks back into the apartment and is about to close the door when simon has another burst of bravery
do something to him
do you realize that i work at him
eyes downcast no i didnt
do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden
actually i even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d
well i work all the time
so never never again interrupt me
i mean never
not years from now
not if theres fire
not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later theres a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and
you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think youre going to faint even then dont come knocking or if its election night and youre excited and want to celebrate because some fudge packer you dated has been elected the first queer president of the united states
and hes going to put you up in camp david and you just want to share the moment with someone
dont knock not on this door
not for anything
its not a subtle point youre making
melvin enters his apartment and slams the door shut
so the theory of confrontations is that now hell think twice before messing with me
frank smiles affectionately
simon turns serious
hes genuinely upsetting isnt he
wont worry about it
you go ahead
frank waits till simon exits scene and then knocks loudly on melvins door
there is a sharp change in his demeanor
oh im pissed
now i am really pissed
frank waits patiently as melvin jerks his door back open
frank immediately grabs melvin by his shirt and jerks him forward
melvin is scared
operating on survival mode
you may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude but i grew up in hell
my grandmother had more attitude
you dont intimidate me
fucking crooked police
doughnut munching morons help me
to frank assault and battery and youre black
i like simon
i like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again
meanwhile ill try and think how you can make this up to him
suddenly loud i hate doing this
im an art dealer
beat have a nice day
he tosses melvin back and walks out
melvin straightens his shirt as he steps out into the hall
frank smiles as he re enters the other apartment
melvin appears impressed
a crowded and dirty street and here comes melvin
his walk is brisk an animal wanting to pass through the danger without giving off the scent of its mounting fear
at times he places his palms together and extends his arms cutting a path through people
we will be very pointed in the fact that he avoids stepping on cracks
his eyes focused on the terrain
carol connelly talks with another mother a customer
you would not guess it but her working hours tend to be the most carefree time of the day
she is telling a story about her son for the umpteenth time
to the mothers little girl look at you youre all better
its that new medication
you know all my sons stuff right
the mother nods too sympathetically that she does but carol interrupts her
no no no i got a date tonight
im walking out the door this morning and he says to me mom i promise not to get one of my fevers or coughs during your date
isnt that sweet
little blonde angle
to child affectionately eat everything
melvin enters and moves past several empty tables to a table towards the back and is obviously surprised to find a man and woman sitting at the table
it just came out of me
i said you love me the way a remote control loves a tv
as long as i switch every time
people who talk in metaphors can shampoo my crotch
on their look eat up
they turn away melvin walks a few paces to the waitress station where two waitresses lisa and carol are talking
pay me back next week
i owe you
i told you today
thems the rules
oh excuse me melvin
she puts two hands lightly on his waist to move him out of the way
he gulps at the contact since no one else ever touches him but covers his self consciousness
firmly to lisa will you please take it
melvin intentionally moves a step in her path with stealth so that she must touch him again to get him out of the way
this way you take a cab home so you have time to get ready for the date
ready is not my problem
she barks a mirthless though hearty laugh
if we could read melvin which we cant wed see him unsettled by the date talk
to carol he is as harmless as furniture
to melvin go sit down
you know youre not allowed back here
spencers more excited about it than i am
he says mom i promise not to get a fever or couch during your date
the other waitresses and the short order cook all go awww
hes just the best
ive got jews at my table
its not your table
its the places table
this once you can sit at someone elses station
the two waitresses signal their protests
or you can just wait your turn
melvin walks back into the restaurant proper
he hangs near their table
his discomfort builds in this limbo
then how much more you got to eat
your appetite isnt as big as your noses is it
to woman lets go the woman starts to protest
melvin sits down at the table and takes from his pocket a plastic eating utensil set wrapped and sealed
as he opens his utensils
bryan says he doesnt care how long youve been coming you ever act like this again youre barred for life
im gonna miss the excitement but ill handle it
there is in carols attitude toward melvin some ingredient of self satisfaction that she is the only one in the place who can handle him
she starts to clear the table
the tables fine if it had some cholesterol on it
two sausages six bacon strips fries three eggs over easy and coffee
youre gonna die soon with that diet you know that
were all gonna die soon
it sure sounds like your son will
some crazy street freak has slipped under her perfect guard and momentarily devastated her
melvin senses that hes gone way too far
he wipes his knife
if you ever mention my son again you will never be able to eat here again
do you understand
give me some sign you understand or leave now
do you understand me
adds truthful label you crazy freak
a beat and then melvin nods hardly breathing backing down
ill get your order
she walks away
melvin watches her biting his lower lip
he takes some napkins and cleans the table himself
she is underneath a younger cuter man on the living room sofa
he is expertly into foreplay
she begins to make noises as she responds
each time startling herself with her own noise and trying to reign it in
shes two women here one speeding the pleasure highway the other functional mom so blown away by the emergence of this sexy self that she laughs
the young man stops and looks at her
i dont know
you got me
his eyes try to burn into hers
she is getting excited but doesnt know how to play it
he pushes one of the fingers of the hand caressing her face toward her mouth
she closes her teeth his fingers attempt opening her mouth
she stops him
let me just do whatever i do by myself
ill catch up to you someplace i promise
as hes put off oh no
dont look like that
im sorry if im a goof
and so with earnestness and caring she has transformed the sex into something more intimate and talk about egg in your beer hotter
things are getting wild when we hear from the distance a child spencer calling and kissing
carol pulls her head away as spencers call continues
softly grandma grandma
maybe you better check
like what did you think i was going to do
pulling herself together she goes off down the hallway
she ducks her head into the first bedroom where her mother beverly is listening to music on headphones
she takes them off when she sees carol then hears the cough
i was hearing just everything you were doing so i put these on to give you privacy
carol now goes into her sons room
the room is a monument to horrible sleepless nights
two drugstore de humidifying filters a nebulizer breathing contraption a waste basket
a night stand filled with medicine a blood pressure kit
along with some stacks of seven year old toys and a small tv wedged into the tiny space
dont be silly
carol feels his head
then he coughs trying to suppress it
then a bigger cough
they each know what that signals
she brings up a waste basket as he throws up
she comforts him
she loves him
as she re enters
he is taking a cigarette from a pack
a bit panicked you cant smoke
he cant take smoke
he palms the cigarette resumes making out his hand squeezes her breast then he stops and looks at his hand
she looks down and sees a bit of throw up he picked up while feeling her and then notices him looking at her with extreme distaste
she barks a laugh to cover her embarrassment but speaks the truth
i dont even notice anymore
she crosses to the kitchen for a dishtowel
tries to make light
thatll teach you
perturbed that wasnt an apology
she notices his demeanor how he avoids looking at her how uncomfortable he is
this is just a little throw up its nothing to be so embarrassed about
as he shifts uncomfortably thanks for the dinner
let me write down which trains you take to get back
ill take a cab
she deflates as he moves past her
too much reality for a friday night
a cold night in hell
three young men bullshit near the approach to the tunnel
their names are vincent evan and doug who is the oldest at
vincent is dopey and the most likeable of the gritty little trio
why is every customer surprised i read books
amazed you read books
i know this guy
he even bought me dinner
they all focus on a black bmw as it slows and stops in front of them
carl checks them out carefully through the front window
he is talking on the speaker phone
slightly exasperated look i just cant
i promised simon id find him a model
on speaker phone flirting carl take me off the speaker
did i tell you that these are house seats
cmon you could use a break
carl are you there
seeing the hustlers i just found a model
to carl hey how its goin
i only need one
you picked me up maybe a few weeks i dont know some time ago
you were very flattering about our
maybe just you and me
but this is for a painting
i need a pretty face
carl beckons to vincent who joins him trying to conceal his pride at winning this lowest end of beauty contest
there is a knock at the door simon crosses to answer
he is more relaxed than weve seen him a man at peace humming to his favorite music talking to his dog who scratches at the door
simon opens the door to vincent
sorry i was out in the studio doing some work and i forgot about our appointment
he leads the way back toward the studio chatting away unaware that vincent is disrobing as he follows him and eyeing the expensive apartment
i usually make such a big deal out of picking models but carls so thorough
ill bet he drove you nuts checking your references
and he turns and sees the naked model
taken aback this isnt a nude
vincent moves back to retrieve his clothes
just kidding around
then mutters so much for love
vincent is striking blatantly sexual poses to the increasingly uneasy simon
exactly what is your previous experience
how about that pose
sing song this is not fun
then give me some direction
vincent has instinctively put simon on the defensive
he tries not to show it
i just watch till something strikes me
do anything you think of try different thing
until i say hold that pose
then just try and comfortably hold it
trying another space the fact that you havent said hold it means i havent done it right
is that correct
i havent done it right
what i do is watch and wait for um
you ever watch someone who doesnt know youre watching
an old woman on a bus kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything
external that its in respond to a private thought they just had
they are just sort of realer and more alive
and when you notice it so are you
if you look at someone long enough you discover their humanity
vincents slack jawed expression changes
he feels an intellectual tingle to be having this conversation
i know exactly what you mean
theres a joy in him at this moment a bit of purity
vincent does so hums a bit of satisfaction to celebrate
carol and leslie another waitress are waiting for their order at the cappuccino bar
leslie is telling the story of the traumatic audition which may have turned her life
carol is rapt
as they pass melvin she does not break stride nor give him notice
though she is aware of him resentfully so hard not to be since he is giving a moment to moment commentary on her every action
clippity clop clippity clop she has to pretend she doesnt hear me
listening to the story from the upset friend
now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesnt even say thank you
no the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and its getting tougher to make believe
reluctant forgiveness okay
melvin stops she passes behind him to deliver an uncharacteristic rabbit punch
whats with the plastic picnic ware
why not try ours
afraid it isnt clean
i see the help judgement call
just give yourself a little pep talk
must try other peoples clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out
whats wrong with your son anyway
what do you care
melvin just looks at her
hes gotta fight to breathe
his asthma can just shoot off the charts hes allergic to dust and this is new york and his immune system bails on him when theres trouble so an ear
is this bothering you
an ear infection can send us to the emergency room maybe five six times a month where i get whatever nine year old they just made a doctor
nice chatting with you
the greenhouse studio is a busy sanctuary as simon puts the finishing touches on his painting of vincent
a beat and then a strange figure crosses between the camera and the scene gone before we can examine him further
you can put on anything you want now
i might be sort of done here
vincent quickly and expertly picks a cd to meet his immediate needs and puts it on dying a little at every second of silence during the transition
then loud music plays
vincent even goosing the volume
simon does a take he gestures vincent to take it down which vincent does
where it is not clear that a robbery is in progress vincents two friends from the street sweeping all objects into large sacks one of them doug pauses to look
past the terrace to the studio
lucky vinnie hes a painting
music plays simon cleaning up his stuff
so youre practically finished huh
well theres one more stage trying to figure out if its any good
simon sneaks a look at the canvas from another perspective
he focuses then the smallest shy nod of self approval hes finished
vincent is desperate to distract
close on dog as verdell awakens stretches and pricks his ears
he moves quickly to the closed door and starts to frantically scratch attracting simons attention
as simon keeps walking
vincent shoots over to the canvas
wait i want to see the painting
just a second he has to go
simon opens the door and verdell shoots out like a bullet
vincent pauses before the painting and is thrown to see his humanity captured to be immortalized
doug and evan are nearly to the front door as verdell stops them with a vicious growl and bark
simon is distracted looking down at his pet so that he continues to walk toward doug and evan not noticing them vincent terribly afraid appears behind simon
to vincent whats the matter sweetheart
he instantly stops
his eyes on the stranger doug looking at him
now vincent comes in
doug greets him
simon turns to vincent
why are you doing this
hey that painting in there
i just want to tell you
now evan appears holding a brass hat rack
to vincent what are you doing
and he uses the hat rack first as a spear then as a club as the brief savage attack begins
as he starts to go toward simon and then scurries back in fear
the three attackers leave
a single bark from verdell
a mass of official people clutter the hall as a gurney is whisked down to the elevator
its impossible to tell if simon is awake or dead
melvin is standing against the wall near his door a cop ray interviewing him
so you call and dont leave your name even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name
how come you make a mistake like that
how come youre pretending to do cop work cause i dont think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole
just move on
no one here killed him
oh is he dead
we will if we can and if we cant well come back and ask you again and again
frank standing upset anxious holding a dog bowl a leash and verdell who is more upset making pathetic little crying sounds
as we focus briefly on verdell
frank is talking to the sweet faced woman
ive been praying for him since i heard
so ive got to get to the hospital
if you could take the dog just for tonight
oh lord ive got all these antique knick knacks
or else id be glad
maybe if you kept locked in the bathroom
as he turns away and she closes the door he adds old bitch
a short laugh makes us realize that melvin has witnessed and enjoyed franks hostile mutterings
verdell starts whimpering as a pissed frank approaches his mugger youre taking him
youre taking him this will clear the books
you want to say no to me
because ive never felt as nuts as i do right this second
i almost want you to try saying no
quietly im not saying nothing to you
thanks for looking after him
frank pushes open the door to melvins apartment and places verdell inside
music in as frank pulls the door partially closed to block verdells escape
the music represents verdells state of mind trapped in the apartment of the man who tried to kill him
we stay with the dog during the o
dialogue as his head turns in panic we see his various povs as the dialogue continues o
hey where are you going
you cant do this
calls after frank i cant take a dog
a confession nobodys ever been in here before
threatening you dont want to mess with me today
ill figure something else out tomorrow
melvin enters the dog cowers in the shadows
now melvin sees him
verdell stops gives melvin wide berth slinking along the far wall
melvin finds verdells fear of him a bit calming
i dont have dog food
and i wont want dog food here
youll eat what we have
youll eat what we eat
verdell is in a major funk
melvin breaks two eggs over a large pile of prime chopped meat sticks raw pieces of bacon into it and exits the room
dont you touch anything
verdell cringing as his new master approaches music continues ominously
melvin sets the bowl down and exits
verdell breathes excitedly though looking alternately in all directions
his recent past making him suspect this feast is a trick
he sniffs cautiously then dives in gothic music changing on a dime to score his rapture
we hear the sound of running water as steam escapes the bathroom then music out as melvin returns
ignoring verdell he sits at the piano and his one key repeatedly
verdell shifts his body so he is eating from the bowl with his tail to melvin
then melvin begins to play and sing monty pythons always look on the bright side of life with its cheerful whistle refrain
verdell looks over with surprise and pleasure
but just as mood lifts and warmth threatens melvin stops abruptly turns out the lights and exits
frank on the phone
into phone put the solid red dots on three of them and the hold blue dots on two others
well were not going to sell anything if they know were two weeks into a show and have no sales
no you cant reduce a price at this stage
were in free fall here
we can see him
ill meet you in there
as jackie enters
how you doing great one
i havent looked at myself yet
i figured i could tell from your reaction
he turns toward her
much of his body taped his painting hand wrapped
simons face is something of a horror
swollen one savage discolored cut
we are into yuccchhh
the sight is a jolt
jackie breaks into tears
that bad huh
they share a helpless half laugh then frank appears in the doorway
as he sees him haaa
bad but temporary
the nurses say its much better than you looked three weeks ago
the hand will come back
jackie will you hand me the mirror
a small voice no
she starts to hand him a large mirror from her purse then thinks better of it
wait i have a smaller one
but he holds out his hand and she gives him the mirror he starts to look then thinks better of it
so whats new anyway
sheepish your neighbor udall is taking care of him
suddenly alive and upset how could you do that
hell hurt him
no i promise
not a chance
i own this guy
there was no one else
im on the move too much
you are very certain my dog is okay
because you have no idea
your dog is fine simon
simon holds the mirror poised for a moment of discovery then he takes a breath like someone about to dive underwater
first a small mumbled pep talk to himself
okay waiting gives the devil time
he quickly brings his hand up and looks at the mirror
he is startled the bottom drops out leaving him awed by his misfortune
whered i go
an establishing shot featuring verdell tied up in front
melvin finishing a plate of eggs bacon and sausage with his plastic knife and fork
carol looks totally beat as she sets down a cup of coffee
melvin is craning periodically to keep an eye of his dog
so what are you doing with a dog
youre not worried that someone might take him
well not until now for christs sake
its okay ill sit here
he changes tables for the first time ever so that he can keep an eye on verdell
carol is amazed
you know hes a little dog
next time if bryans not here you can bring him in
how old are you
if i had to guess by your eyes id say you were fifty
carol looks at him
and if i had to guess by your eyes
id say you were kind
so so much for eyes
but as long as you bring up age
how old are you
quickly otherwise youre not ugly
laughs out loud okay pal
i accept the compliment but go easy my knees start a knocking when you turn on the charm full blast
whats with the dark
he indicates the bags under her eyes by tapping his own
dawn patrol major dawn patrol
my son had a full blown attack
and this time for extra fun they gave us the wrong antibiotics so i get him home
she reaches for the plate of uneaten bacon he goes nuts
the bacons for the dog
she is jolted by the insensitivity of his interruption but he doesnt notice turning almost chatty
last week i was playing the piano for him and he likes it and so i decide im going to make a little joke
you all set here
melvin nods a bit frustrated about not being able to finish his dog story
he pockets the remaining bacon
as melvin walks verdell back home we notice perhaps a beat before melvin a remarkably event
verdell is avoiding the cracks in the sidewalk
its a beautiful day for our walk
melvin slows observes the dog mirroring his behavior
again carefully placing his paws to avoid a crack in the sidewalk
melvin laughs out loud puts on plastic gloves hurriedly so he can lift the dog to eye level
dont be like me dont you be like me
you stay just the way you are because you are a perfect man
im gonna take you home and get you something to eat
what you love
id like to be treated like that
all smiles to verdell lets go home and do some writing
melvin whaling away at his computer reading to himself with great satisfaction as he goes
verdell sits at his chair fascinated by the speed of his masters fingers on the keyboard
he reads his writing aloud to the dog
he turned off the gas jets and carried her outside
he kissed her brow and when her eyes opened and found him he said there are easier ways to break a date
the only sensible ambition he had ever known was now realized
he had made the girl happy
and what a girl
youve saved my life she said youd better make it up to me
exhilarated by his own words he shuts down the machine
singing to verdell done
playing with him some yes i hate the doggy
yes i hate the doggy
sixty two books
as the dog goes shooting off to the kitchen we leave our couples play time for
as the rookie invalid awakens in precisely the same foul mood hed had on falling asleep
in the living room the maid nora is talking with jackie we catch only a few words as they review simons mounting pile of bills and talk of how long
nora can stay on
frank knocking on melvins door
he opens it
hows verdell doing
hes a pain in the ass
as he looks over at the dog verdell trots over and without realizing it melvin smiles at him to franks surprise
i was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until hes had a chance to think and adjust
leaping at the chance its been five weeks
another few wont kill me
he wants him back
hell be by tomorrow
too loudly weirdly okay by me
melvin sits verdell looks up at him
melvin walks to the door
he turns the lock
then checks that they are locked
checks again to make sure he turned them in the correct direction
turns from the door
then back to check once more
anguished until now he breaks briefly the dog looking on
melvin opens the door looks at the scarred simon in a wheelchair and shudders
thats some face they left hanging on you
you look like
interrupting could you take it just a little easy mr
a beat of silence as melvin thinks whether to comply
to melvin by the way thanks for saving me
i never touched you
i didnt leave my name or nothing
not listening verdell
totally weirded out
hiding behind melvin
now melvin shifts and simon and verdell see each other
simon smiles at the dog
he is emotionally caught up in the reunion
verdell isnt eager
the first gnawing pains of rejection
simon pats his leg trying unsuccessfully to get verdell to approach him
instead the dog goes to the door and scratches at it
jackie starts to pick the dog up
please dont force him
to dog you little stinker
hes given you everything
verdells towel on the floor near his bowl
melvins lips compress
he sits on the piano bench and hits a few keys
looks at verdells empty spot again
there are those who get the joke melvin is clearly one he laughs suddenly and helplessly even as he feels the panic rise in him
all his painstaking success in keeping the lid on and now it threatens to blow for a reason he articulates
over the dog
an ugly dog
but now the humor detours
an actual sob is choked back
he gets up following a definite pattern across the room
he is conducting a small but highest stakes fight for survival
momentarily a scared beaten middle aged man he races out the door
melvin charging as fast as crack checks allow and then turning into a building with a copper sign reading grammercy park psychiatric group
worst sidewalk in new york and look where they put in
melvin bursts in on the psychiatrist and emits one word
if you want to see me you will not do this
you will make an appointment
explain to me how you can diagnose someone as obsessive compulsive disorder and then act like i have any choice in barging in
theres not going to be a debate
you must leave
the doctor moves into the hallway forcing melvin to follow
you said you could help me what was that a tease
i can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app suddenly you changed the room around
two years ago
melvin shakes his head as if things werent bad enough he must go through a careful exercise noting every new element before hes at all comfortable
as he studies each object
the doctor is professionally intrigued despite himself
i also regrew my beard
but youre not interested in changes in me
so its like i always told you
when it comes to people you
i dont have this mountain of available time
i got to get to my restaurant on time
do you know how hard it is for me to be here
as melvin starts for the office no
more patients in the almost crowded waiting room
melvin passes through visibly drawn and upset
eyes on them
then to other patients what if this is as good as it gets
they look stricken
as he walks to his booth and sits down
cheryl a heavy set waitress reluctantly moves to his table unseen by melvin as he takes out his utensils and arranges them
in a corner booth four big transit authority police are having a meal together
cheryl looks at his utensils
what the heck are those for
im filling in
we dont know if shes coming back
she might have to get a job closer to home
what are you trying to do to me
what the heck do you mean
hey elephant girl call her or something
just let her do my one meal here
ill pay whatever
as she doesnt budge he screams do it
the manager comes over gesturing to the table of police that he can handle it
all attention is on melvin
be silent or leave
ill be quiet
just let me wait
get her here have her get me two sausages four bacon two eggs over easy and coffee
im not a prick here im a great customer
this day is a disaster
i cant handle this too
get out immediately or theres going to be trouble
melvin looks at the police sizes up the hopeless situation and rises
theres going to be trouble
he walks toward the door as cheryl and all the other employees applaud his defeat
as he passes a busboy near the door he hands him dollars
carols last name
an uncomfortable melvin sitting in the back of a taxi
a neighborhood in brooklyn a community
melvin ever the shark observer looks from the cab to see slices of community life men in front of a bar parents giving their child a ride on a mechanical
horse outside a local store two young women discuss dating
as he exits rings the bell and is buzzed in
carol opens the door just as he arrives on her landing
she holds a container of ice washclothes and a thermometer
on carols astonished look youve upset my whole day
i havent eaten
what are you doing here
melvin ignores the question instead answering a charge he had imagined she might make
this is not a sexist thing
if you were a waiter i would still be here saying
are you totally gone
this is my private home
i am trying to keep emotions out of this
even though this is an important issue to me and i have strong feelings about the subject
that i wasnt there to take crap from you and bring you eggs
do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get
yes i do as a matter of fact
and to prove it i have not gotten personal and you have
why arent you at work
youre not sick you dont look sick
just very tired and bitter
my son is sick okay
even saying the sentence my son is sick pushes some emotions toward the surface which are wasted on the crazy man at her threshold
what about your mother
how do you know about my mother
i hear you talk when im waiting
she crosses to the sink to dump the ice
melvin takes a step inside
spencer seven and looking ill walks into the room
ill be right there
uncomfortably how ya doing
spencer just stares at him
miffed you should answer when someone talks to you
carol eyes melvin with disgust and disbelief then emphatically gestures him to clear out
melvin backs out the door
there is a limit melvin and i cant handle you teaching my son manners
she closes the door in his face then walks to her son and leads him back to his room
camera moves toward mother and son sitting on the edge of spencers bed
she holds a digital thermometer to his ear
they both count down the seconds
we are going to treat ourselves to a cab ride
as carol carries her young son through a class of uniformed kids from a catholic elementary school
she spots melvin about to enter a cab
the school kids pick up the chant in unison
he turns to face them
shut up kids
they immediately obey as carol approaches him
give us a lift
weve got to go see our friends at the hospital
melvin is thrown
he pauses a beat
then holds the rear door open as carol hustles the kid inside
the maneuver puts the beet red sweating spencer at his face
ill ride up front
cover your mouth when you cough kid
as they settle in and drive off
brooklyn presbyterian hospital please and quickly please
as carol enters the hospital
calling back i owe you three dollars
melvin follows behind her as she carries her son
any chance youll get back to work today
stay away from me
verdell lies just inside the front door whimpering for melvin
jackie sits across from simons wheel chair
she has some index cards in her laps which she occasionally consults and shuffles
i feel terrible that i have to
forget about the dog for a second
simon forces his attention to jackie
what are those cards
a bit embarrassed franks idea
he thought i should have notes so i did this right
maintained focus didnt get emotional and tried not to terrify you
scared shitless terrify me
see hes right
i need the cards
reading from cards simon youre broke
as their conversation continues the dog is distressed
the medical bill are thousand now
ive spoken to your parents and they didnt hang up or anything they just said they would feel strange calling you
well i cant reach them
verdell walks out on the terrace and looks off
he turns for to verdell here baby
what is it verdell
you miss the tough guy
trying to be melvin like well here i am you little pissant mop happy to see me
how about another ride down the chute
i dont mean it sweetheart
on jackies look im sorry
verdell hides behind a chair
frank loves you
you know that
but ive spoken to him and he feels that reading from card as a businessman with limited resources
ill be able to keep my apartment and studio wont i
just tell me
as jackie looks at him then thumbs for a card
verdell has come near him he reaches out a hand to pet the dog and the dog ducks
he is trying to write
his world has been upset
he walks away from his work a highly unusual act
he is distressed and then an idea and he exits
we are looking at zoe the receptionist
she is listening with interest to an o
conversation while answering phone calls premier publishing
yes you write more than anyone else
yes you make us a lot of money but isnt there someone more appropriate to
i need this
just say melvin ill try okay
resigned melvin ill try
they appear now the woman tall attractive etc
she pauses at the elevator
now on a pleasant note our son got accepted at brown
curtly great wonderful
i dont need you to wait with me
she nods pissed waves and leaves
as melvin waits zoe summons her moxie
i cant resist
you usually move through here so quickly and i have so many questions i want to ask you
you have no idea what your work means to me
whats it mean
that somebody out there knows what its like to be
taps her head and heart in here
oh god this is like a nightmare
aw come on just a couple of questions how hard is that
as he hits the button wipes his fingers hits the button etc
how do you write women so well
as he turns toward her i think of a man and take away reason and accountability
the fan is jolted as the elevator doors open and close
a depleted exhausted carol approaches her home
she is suddenly wary sound dialed down as we move closer
a car at the curb with md license plate
as carol breaks into a run
as she bounds the stairs comes to her apartment door and jiggles with the keys a strange prescient whimpering sound coming from her
as she enters the apartment
connelly im in here
the worst confirmed she moves down the narrow hallway her innards squirting the same chemicals that drives elk on opening day of the hunting season
im martin bettes dr
not your name
what are you telling me your name for
where is he
hes in the bathroom
overlapping tell me how bad it is
i let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt just and underone with just the straps and i know better
and i let him talk me into it
he was whining and
you dont need this
give me a second to catch hold
and so she does
wow does she
and gives us some notion of the size of her fear demon and the strength it takes to subdue it as dr
bettes keeps reassuring her and she keeps nodding
finally a deep breath as spencer enters from the bathroom
all at hyper speed now
salvation as farce
to his mother hi
they kiss did you know there are doctors who come to your house
no i didnt
to bettes so why are you h
beverly carols mother enters the room
she is ebullient which if life allowed would be her natural state
i didnt know you had a secret admire
you met the gift
and im an expert on doctors
to spencer stay out of this
my wife is melvin udalls publisher
as carol reacts she says i have to take great care of this guy because youre urgently needed back at work
what work do you do
im a waitress
bettes reaction her mother adds a saving grace
a nurse enters
sorry it took so long
i dont know brooklyn
its okay terry
hands her blood vail tell the lab id like the report back today
carol and her mother exchange a look of incredulity
youre going to get the results today
as we approach the doctor and carol seated across from each other at a small table
bettes is examining medicine bottles
how long has he been having problems
have they done blood tests on him
only in the emergency room or when he was well
emergency room only
have they done skin testing for allergies
they havent done the standard scratch test
where they make small injections into the skin
they said its not covered under my plan
and its not necessary anyway
its amazing these things werent done
bastard piece of shit
actually i think thats their technical name
once the tests come back is there someone i can reach in your office for the results
my home number is on this card
his home number
carol look at her mother they share a laugh
beverly has a hard time stopping
to doctor do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves
nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in spencers room
she starts towards spencers room
you dont have to do it this second
its not dangerous or anything
its just something thats advisable
look theres a lot to be checked but
hey your son is going to feel a good deal better at the very least
she pats his head
then embraces him with fierce intimacy
then so listen you gotta let me know about the additional costs one way or the other well
udall wants to be billed
she takes this as a blow to the heart stomach and groin
simon practices walking using his cane
a tearstained nora hugs him good bye
you poor poor man
lets use just one poor okay
anyway dear thanks for everything
forgive my recent crankiness and as soon as things are on track again ill call
she kisses him and starts for the door and suddenly a sharp intake of breath shes forgotten something
whos going to walk verdell
simon hadnt thought of this either
nora holding her things knocks on melvins door
melvin opens the door
nora is still sniffling
is he dead yet
would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him
not just today uh could you do it until until he gets back on his feet
youre a wonderful man
two oclock is a good time
heres the key in case hes asleep
open the curtains for him so he sees gods beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best
whered they teach you to talk like this some panama city sailor want to hump hump bar
or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey
sell crazy some place else were all stocked up here
he closes the door in her face
she stands there
thrown by the abruptness then lifts the two paper shopping bags holding her things walks back toward the elevator pausing briefly outside simons door then continues on her way
the doctor gone mother and daughter arguing
there is a seriously goofy man behind this
you are not allowed to block out that fact
do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in emergency who keep telling us they cant help
it lets a crazy man into our lives
why fight when we know how it will come out
this isnt like stocking or a string of pearls
you dont send this one back
simon is a wheelchair
the phone rings
he goes to answer
the phone across the bed so that reaching for the phone is a brief but difficult struggle
he grunts with pain hope and anxiety as he answers
because i called you so many times
relief oh boy
i was hoping it was something like that
you didnt get one of them huh
cause i mean it wasnt only your office it was your home hotel and the cigar club you like in san francisco
i believe you
no dont fire anyone
maybe im wrong about the times
take a breath
more so you miss me a little
hey strike the question hows the case going
i didnt hear
i havent been watching
im so happy
well im mending
no i look fine
well some of the damage might still be noticeable if you look closely
he runs a hand across his scarred and still bloated and beaten face
carl i need some help and youre the logical one to turn to
not cause i blame you for what happened
i hardly get how you can ever think that
no im not being sarcastic
trying to figure it out i guess because you hired the guy who did this you think
no i am a sarcastic person
well if you must know the reason i said you were the logical person is because you always told me how you thought i was this great person who made
you feel good about humanity and everything
you do remembering saying that
okay so carl
i hate asking but this money thing is ridiculously serious
he picks up an index card from his night stand and takes the leap reading the text he prepared in advance
will you please loan me money
i will pay you back
i will give you whatever percentage of my income i dont absolutely need until i do
it will take a while
but i dont know what ill do if you say
as he listens i understand
no i do
a bit of boldness but you know you know you didnt even ask how much carl
well frank has no right to discuss how much im in hock
no youre right not the point
what have you been up to
oh the group show
how was it
well im not surprised that theres that much talent around
look gotta go
no you shouldnt feel that way at all
take care you too
as he hangs up pal o mine
its very quiet
a lonely figure who now holds his good hand up to his face and appears on the verge of enormous emotional release camera moves toward him as if to rendezvous
with the moment of catharsis
but simon is denied even this small luxury as the camera abruptly adjusts just as he begins sobbing to focus on the door opening and melvin and verdell entering the
maybe ill bring him some food by
thank you for walking him
simon wheels away from melvin
if youll excuse me im not feeling so well
it smells like shit in here
that cleaning woman doesnt
please just leave
where are all your queer party friends
his first shout get out
melvin pauses simon weeping
verdell looks at simon with concern
melvin is thrown
nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you
nellie youre a disgrace to depression
rot in hell melvin
no need to stop being a lady
quit worrying youll be back on your knees in no time
simon swings his arm and cast at melvin the sudden attack jolts melvin but not as much as what follows
is this fun for you
well you lucky devil
it just gets better and better
i am losing my apartment and frank wants me to promise to paint hotter subjects and to beg my parents who havent called for help
and i wont
and i dont want to paint anymore
melvin has made for the door
simon blocks him
so the life i was trying for is over
the life i had is gone and i am feeling so damn sorry for myself that it is difficult to breathe
right times for you huh melvin
the gay neighbor is terrified
a sudden screamed word surprises them both terrified
lucky you youre here for rock bottom
me wallowing in self pity in front of you you absolute horror of a human being
as simon works to stop crying melvin is weird with discomfort
well ill do one thing for you that might cheer you up
dont piss on a gift tough guy
you want to know why the dog prefers me
its not affection
its a trick
simon looks up his mood turning on a dime hes rapt
melvin comes and stands by his wheelchair
i carry bacon in my pocket
pleased oh my gosh
hands him bacon now well both call him
come on sweetheart
yo yo yo
verdell goes like a bullet to melvin
who is totally surprised and staggered by the implications
true love and such
would you leave now please
to simon i dont get it
looking apologetically at simon in stoic ruin
carol in bed on the pullout sofa
she is in turmoil
there is thunder but no rain
she walks to the kitchen
she is trembling as she drinks a glass of water and exits
the room is on an air shaft and this is where carol shares a closet with her mother who is now asleep
carol quietly extracts a dress from the closet leaving her nightgown on the floor
there is something sexy here the woman in carol churning
she plops on a summer dress no time for underwear
carol seeing a bus and dashing after it
carol crossing to manhattan
she looks as if shes on her way to some final exam where she has no notion of the subject
hot summer night as she gets off the bus and now the rains come
we are in a familiar neighborhood
as carol consults the slip of paper with the address on it
as she enters building and realizes its not just that shes wet the thin summer dress is a winner in any wet t shirt contest
the fabric clinging to her breasts like the old movie poster of the deep
as carol passes simons door
stands in front of melvins apartment twists herself to ease nervousness and knocks on the door
then rings the bell
finally carol hears muffled throat clearing on the other side of the door
carol the waitress
as we hear him unlock the door carol looks at her breasts and gasps
she grasps the fabric and holds it straight out just as melvin opens the door
his hair is static city standing on end as he periodically gives it self conscious pats
the doctors had your billing address
im sorry about the hour
i was working
cant you just drop me a thank you note
thats not why im here
tearing suddenly though you have no idea what its like to have a real conversation with a doctor about spencer
very uncomfortable note
put it in the note
why did yo do this for me
to get you back at work so you can wait on me
but you do have some idea how strange that sounds
im worried that you did this because
she pauses the beginning of an extraordinarily long silence
you waiting for me to say something
as she shakes her head what sort of thing do you want
look ill be at the restaurant tomorrow
i dont think i can wait until tomorrow
this needs clearing up
what needs clearing up
strong and true im not going to sleep with you
i will never ever sleep with you
well hell never get credit for the brief but intense inner struggle the struggle not to scream not to cry to process the sudden and stunning hurt during his half
turn away from her and then answer hoarsely
we dont open for the no sex oaths until a
carol is amused surprised
maybe in some small way ever taken by his style
but top priority is clarity
im not kidding
just how grateful i am
her mission completed she turns
so youll be at work
its a a
as the two digital clocks on melvins night stand tell us
he gets up the first time weve seen his waking routine taps one foot on the floor twice then the other foot two more taps and his body angles from
the bed in a deliberate way
he is having anxiety
he sits at the piano and plays very briefly
stops wipes some sweat from his forehead
walks to his computer room turns the light on and then quickly off
walks to his refrigerator
as he grabs a cardboard take out box
he knocks of simons door
it opens quickly
i took a chance you were up
simon walks painfully back to a chair
i brought you chinese soup
i have never been so tired in my life
okay if i sit here
got any easier questions
melvin sits and moans the dog sitting near him
i havent been sleeping
i havent been clear or felt like myself
im in trouble
some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back
but the tiredness boy
not just sleepy
but sick nauseous where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches when you can barely get up the will to complain
he feels a touch of community and not knowing where to take it from here
im glad we did this
he rises and makes an awkward exit
good talking to you
he exits simon puzzled and concerned
carol seated working on a letter
she is trying to express her gratitude
an enormous sheaf of completed pages sit next to her
she is so involved she doesnt even look up as a young man sean knocks on the door and is let in by beverly
they exchange greetings and move inside where we faintly hear spencer greeting him
we move in and read over carols shoulder im sorry to have gotten sloppy and emotional in this letter but it would have been on my conscionce sic forever if
i didnt tell you how gratefull sic
youre not still writing that thank you note
im on the last page
how do you spell conscience
c o n s c i e n c e
i got sean from the bakery to baby sit so lets go out
i still dont feel safe leaving spencer with someone
how do you spell it again
spencer is okay
youd better start finding something else to do with your free time
if you cant feel good about this break and step out a little
struts and pumps her arms you ought to get mr
udall to send you over a psychiatrist
more emotionally than she intended i dont need one cause i know whats really going on here
i have to finish this letter or ill go nuts
looking at paper weepy this cant be right con science
carol breathes heavily gets control stopping herself on the brink of crying
carol is amazed at herself
that she might not be able to stem the flow
wide eyed with apprehension she looks at her mother who in return only nods permission for carol to let it go
a last defiant snort from carol and then she is overwhelmed
the headline comes first
i dont know
its very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time
without that you just start thinking about yourself and what does that ever get anybody
today on the bus there was this adorable couple and i felt myself giving them a dirty look i had no idea everything was
great forceful hand gestures moving in the wrong direction
away from when i even remembered what it was like to have a man to
hold fucking sorry hands with for christs sake
i was feeling like really bad that dr
bettes is married
this next ones tough which is probably why i make poor spencer hug me more than he wants to
like the poor kid doesnt have enough problems
he has to make up for his mom not getting any
weeps at her insight oh boy
who needs these thoughts
spencers doing fine
so what are you saying that youre frustr
leave me be
why are you doing this
why are you picking at my sores
what is it that you want
you want what
whats with you
i hope getting me thinking of everything thats wrong when all i want is to not do this has some purpose
puffy red furious what is it mom
slumped fought out carol gets out one last naked husky voiced question
what is it you want
i want us to go out
a beat then
as they enter still wiping away the effects of their cry
to sean were going out
looking at their red eyes looks like fun
she kisses spencer almost getting involved in what hes doing then sees her mother waiting
okay were out of here
i love you
spencer nods involved with sean
camera follows carol as she exits the apartment her mother leading
halfway down the stairs she stops and reverses herself going back to the apartment which she re enters then to her son to ask do you love me
beverly and carol walking past the store windows
a simple and unprecedented experience in their recent lives
nice to get out isnt it
carol nods tightly
then they wrap arms around each other and continue walking turning into a corner bar
as carol stands nervously while lisa finishes reading her page letter
in the b
melvin and frank are seated at the same table and in earnest conversation
lisa keeps flicking away tears a few drops on the pages
dont get it wet
lisa brushes the paper finishes and embraces carol
so its okay
you almost have me liking him
you sure come from the heart
i never knew what you went through with everything
i wanted him to know how much hed done
looking over can you believe hes eating with someone
its not my dog and this simon seems to have enough on his mind but he did throw up twice and his spark is off
sure take him to the vet
and his stomach is out of whack
so they need him for a couple of days
she self consciously hands him with the thick envelope
sotto a thank you note for what you did for me
he hands it back to her deliberately
she takes it and walks back to the service area where embarrassed confused and messed with she tosses the note
after carol leaves
to frank really nice
shouldnt that be a good thing
telling someone no thanks required
it looks like it really went over
youre sure making the rounds
simon says you brought him soup last night
i hope he doesnt write you a note
melvin looks up wary his brain sends a disturbing message
look at you
you sense a mark
hey you called me
about a dog
yeah but its all about simon now
you helped with the dog
and now there are other things
im just as concerned as you are about simon
im just the hall monitor here
its not only financial assistance
what hes got to do is go to baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money
its not going to happen on the phone
if his parents are alive theyve got to help those are the rules
i have a high maintenance selling painter coming through
so im out
can you take him
think white and get serious
carol enters scene
take my car a convertible
do you drive
loudly like the wind but im not doing it
getting loud getting loud
he wants me to take his car and his client to baltimore
i want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so i can get out of this city
frank prepares to depart
ill take him
get him packed ready tomorrow morning
frank stumbles back
self satisfied he relaxes
so ill see you tomorrow
lets not drag this out
we dont enjoy another that much
if theres some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know
last word freak
frank adjusts and exits
carol approaches calling a good bye to him
im going to give my queer neighbor a lift to baltimore
hey what i did for you is working out
a breath then what you did changed my life
she offers him the note
no thank you notes
well part of what i said in this entire history of my life which you wont read is that somehow youve done more for my mother my son and me
than anyone else ever has
and that makes you the most important surprising generous person ive ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever
i also wrote one part
i wrote im sorry
i was talking about i was sorry when i got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so i
reading from the letter melvin wildly uncomfortable i was sorry for busting you on that
and im sorry for busting in on you that night
when i said i was never
i was sorry and im sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler
melvin wants to disappear but carol is getting into it emotionally moved by her own words
and im sorry for never spotting right there at the table in the restaurant the human being that had it in him to do this thing for us
you know what im just going to start from the beginning
i have not been able to express my gratefulness to you
even as i look at the word grateful now it doesnt begin to tell you what i feel for you
and finally carol notes melvins mood and pauses
nice of you
now i want you to do something for me
she looks at him for a very strange long beat
oh im sorry
didnt i say what
i thought i said what
i want you to go on this trip
i cant do this alone
im afraid hell pull the stiff one eye on me
i need you to chaperon
separate everything but cars
you said you liked convertibles
now im on the hook
the stiff one eye
you take off when you have to
bettes tells me hes doing fine
no other way melvin id rather not
whats that got to do with it
funny i thought it was a strong point
write me a note and aint she sweet
i need a hand and whered she go
are you saying accepting your help obligates me
is there another way to see it
carol takes an old weekend case down from the top shelf of the closet
well heres a little suitcase shocked that its been used
she holds up a dress a pretty one
then decides its too pretty and puts it back
now she looks in another drawer and pauses as if she ponders one of the mysteries of the ages
she hesitates then talks to herself
her best underwear neatly stacked alongside her everyday girl jockies
she fingers the good stuff puts it back then the everyday hesitates
furiously exasperated theres not way to pack for this trip
well ill tell you im not packing the camera
as she exits the room as she picks up the phone
melvin is in his bedroom everything hes taking neatly stacked on the bed waiting to be packed he is taking a camera
he has a list of what he needs
all items underwear socks etc
with four checks next to each one and still he checks each stack on the bed and adds another check
the phone rings
this is an amazing development
he has almost no recent experience with receiving a nighttime phone call
he makes a little comment to himself as he moves
he stops briefly trying to remember where the phone is and then remembering crosses and picks it up but before bringing it to his mouth nervously clears his throat
as she hears his throat being cleared
it is not a pretty sound
the following conversation is intercut
are you still coming
melvin visibly relaxes
id like to know exactly where we are going
just south to baltimore maryland
so i know what youre going to ask next
correcting himself that you might ask im not certain
theres no need to bring anything dressy
i mean i didnt know if wed be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes
a beat we might
what did you think i was going to ask
whether crabs are in season there now
okay then melvin
beverly looks up expectantly as her daughter enters
how was it talking to him
stop treating this like im going away with a man
hes just going to say those crappy sick complaining angry things to me
i hate this mom i hate this
hes a freak show the worst person i ever met
well maybe he has nice friends
beverly and spencer wait with her
the bus approaches
she kisses them
to spencer you stand there and ill wave to you from the back window
as she boards the bus
call me as soon as youre settled
to spencer i love you
the bus driver closes the doors on her she shoves them open
to bus driver sensitive huh
the bus pulls out
he runs after the bus waving at his mother who grows concerned that he might be taxing himself
a female veterinarian in surgical scrubs holds verdell as melvin finishes filling out some forms
on opposite sides of the waiting room a very large black dog and a tiny chihuahua sit patiently with their owners
anything unusual in the dogs diet
everybody gets their own cage
pointing to chihuahua put him in with that one not that one
pointing to large dog builds his confidence
as she walks and turns a corner
the shot of the prisoner taking the walk toward the death chamber
but the prisoner has grit her knees do not buckle
she does not whimper
no prison screws will have to support her weight
still the prospect couldnt be grimmer
melvin next to a spiffy convertible
he is wearing driving gloves and turns to witness the tussle frank and simon are having just inside the building
im sorry that im not taking you
upset so am i frank
frank starts to leave simon stops him
soak it up its your last chance at a hug for a few days
as frank moves off melvin sees carol and his demeanor changes
that quickly there is a shyness
thanks for being on time
carol the waitress this is simon the fag
oh my god who did that to you
walked in on people robbing me
i was hospitalized
i almost died
lets do the small talk in the car
carol puts her bag in the car
i was going to do that for you
taken aback its okay
where should we sit
totally non plussed i uh i
well there is no place cards or anything
to simon let me go in back
you look like you need all the room you can manage
thats very thoughtful
never a break
carol steps into the back
melvin disappointed that hes not sitting next to carol
carol is wedged in the small back seat
she struggles to get her feet in
youre really jammed back there
he reaches for the latch between his legs and slides his seat and with some effort wrenches it forward giving carol more room and putting his right against the wheel
she is startled by the gesture
and off they go
simon and carol stunned by the manners
turning onto fifth
i got the whole ride programmed
camera follows as melvin goes to a rack of cds all carefully labelled
he selects and begins to play the one marked icebreaker
it is a song which we clearly and quickly judge as off the circumstances a quick burst of y
melvin stops the music and chuckles
just wanted to see what youd do
no we have greatness here
he goes for another cd labelled for use to rep things the car turns onto seventh as we hear beautifully hey i like this music
and as the music plays simon looks out
the three of them
carol chattering away
i dont know the last time ive been out of the city
hey my arms are tanning
i used to tan great
we gotta stop soon sose i can check on spencer
during the above im sorry
i cant hear you
i cant turn my head all the way yet
tell her we cant hear her
shes enjoying herself
consider it part of the music
a short time later
carol is now driving
im sure simon they did something real off for you to feel this way
but when it comes to your partners or your kid things will always be off for you unless you set it straight
maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance
anybody here whos interested in what melvin has to say raise their hands
simon does not raise his hand
simon and carol have thus declared their majority
do you want to know what happened with my parents
i really would
no let me pull over so i can pay full attention
car pulling over toward parking spot
she takes the car curbside and parks
now go ahead
simon looks back at melvin as does carol
he looks innocent
several beats melvin almost says something a hidden hand gesture from carol stops him
well i always painted
and my mother always encouraged it
she was sort of fabulous about it actually
and she used to
i was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it
and she was very natural
she used to pose nude for me
and i thought or assumed my father was aware of it
this stuff is pointless
hey you let him
you like sad stories you want mine
go ahead simon
dont let him stop you
well one day my father came in on one of those painting sessions when i was nine and he just started screaming at her at us at evil
very quickly my father didnt leave his room for years he hit my hand with a yardstick if i made a mistake on the piano
go ahead simon
your father walked in on you and was yelling and
really come on
i was trying to defend my mother and make peace in the lamest way
i said shes not naked its art
and then he started hitting me
and he beat me unconscious
after that he talked to me less and less he knew before i left for college my dad came into my room
he held out his hand
it was filled with money
a big wad of sweaty money
gathers himself and he said to me i dont want you to ever come back
i grabbed him and i hugged him
he turns and walked out
carol whose life has been rugged but basic feels as strange as she does moved by simons trauma which is so much more complicated than her meat and potatoes troubles
she looks out her window then kisses her fingers and touches them to simons cheek
a nice understated gesture of friendship
well you know i still stay what i said
youve got to get past it all when it comes to your parents
we all have these horror stories to get over
melvin shifts into the frame
thats not true
some of us have great stories
pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad
just not anybody in this car
but lots of people thats their story good times and noodle salad
and thats what makes it hard
not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good
not it at all really
a veterans irony not at all huh
lets go to the hotel
and if youre lucky tomorrow dad will give you another wad of sweaty money
two bedrooms and the sofa opens
carol is on the phone in the living room she hangs up
to simon no answer
maybe we should just drive there tomorrow
can i have that one
to simon ill take the sofa
carol walks into her room the nicest room shell ever have slept in
she goes to the phone and dials
into phone hello
why are you out of breath
that is great
so no wait a second spence
melvin watches simon struggle to unpack his especially neat suitcase
melvin is uncomfortable
can i ask you a personal question
simon laughs loudly in apprehension squared
do you ever get an erection for a woman
wouldnt your lie be a lot easier if you were not
you consider your life easy
i give you that one
eyes suitcase nice packing
carol enters the common living room
melvin is sitting there
carol is dealing with a number of unsettling new factors in her life
my son was outside playing soccer
i never saw him playing ball
come on you guys take me out for a good time
take me out dancing
i cant im exhausted
carol walks to simon and puts an arm on him
melvin is visibly disturbed by her gesture
to simon i dont blame you
this is a monumental first day out
you sad or anything
it would be very rough carol if you werent along
what a nice compliment
she gives simon a kiss
melvin deals with jealousy
she turns to him
and youre my date
lets get dressed
she exits the room
im going to jump in the shower
ill be right with you
as carol dressed in a thrift shop find enters the main room of the suite and hears the shower running she sits down to wait through
showing the enormous length of time which transpires until finally a seriously clean melvin emerges from the bathroom through a cloud of steam
as they drive up
good evening sir
they sell hard shell crabs here
as they enters
you have hard shells right
stop asking everyone
just him and thats it
okay you can answer weve worked it out
yes we do
and i can give you a tie and jacket
they require a tie and jacket but we have some available
he reaches into the coat and check room and withdraws them
im not wearing that and just in case you were going to ask im not going to let you inject me with plaque either
you promised a nice place cant you just
to head waiter you have these dry cleaned all the time dont you
actually i dont think so
to carol wait here
as melvin takes his car back from the valet
as the car goes right across the street to a shopping mall
melvin walks to the doorway and stops suddenly
i need a coat and tie
camera reveals that the floor is intricately patterned so that passage for melvin is impossible
come on in
pointing that jacket and give me a tie
as he pulls up a new valet taking his car
you have hard shells
im not sure
everyone else says you do
then i guess we do
as he enters looks for and then spot carol
she is having a martini at the bar
sitting on a stool watching couples dance
happy by herself
turning down a man who wants to buy her another
and melvin watches
watches his date
shall i get her for you
no its all right
ill just watch
he enjoys watching her for a few more beats
she turns melvin makes a haul your ass over here gesture
and she smiles and walks toward him
a waiter has lifted her drink placed it on a tray and follows her
she takes a bit of a slalom course through the tables giddy as the music plays and couples dance in the b
she notices the waiter in her trail
mouthing the words to melvin my drink is following me
melvin watches her approach
it is all too exquisite
he takes a breath it doesnt come easily
you look s
she stops herself from saying sexy regathers then
you look great
they arrives at the table
he holds out her chair for her
you wanna dance
ive been thinking about that since you brought it up before
and before she can digest that i dont get this place
they make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress
i dont get it
melvin has no idea he has insulted her
sandbagged in extreme she gets up actually ready to leave
i didnt mean it
you gotta sit down
you can still give me the dirty look
just sit down and give it to me
melvin pay me a compliment
i need one and quick
you have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings
really pissed mutters that monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away
thats not compliment melvin
thats just trying to sound smart so i feel stupid
a compliment is something nice about somebody else
now or never
he waves her down
sitting and mean it
can we order first
she thinks and then nods
the waiter is across the room
this does not stop melvin
calling two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer
to carol baked or fries
calling one baked one fries
shouting back ill tell your waiter
to carol okay i got a real great compliment for you and its true
i am so afraid youre about to say something awful
dont be pessimistic
its not your style
here i goes
clearly a mistake
this is hell for him i have this what
and my doctor a shrink
who i used to see all the time
he says or percent of the time a pill can really help
i hate pills
very dangerous things pills
hate i am using the word hate about pills
my compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how youd never well you were there you know
the next morning i started taking these pills
a little confused i dont quite get how thats a compliment for me
amazing that something in melvin rises to the occasion so that he uncharacteristically looks at her directly then you make me want to be a better man
carol never expected the kind of praise which would so slip under her guard
she stumbles a bit flattered momentarily moved and his for the taking
thats maybe the best compliment of my life
then ive really overshot here cause i was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out
so how are you doing with those pills
well i hopahopahopa
takes months to know
they work little by little
holds his head then talking like this is exhausting
carol moves to the chair next to him
she sits very close he tenses
have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid
heres the trouble with never
for the kiss
their faces are close she looks at him
she closes her eyes her face moving toward him he is wide eyed and afraid
his face almost moves away in a shot this close its almost flight
but now his head moves back and he receives her kiss
it is brief
carol smiles encouragement to him and herself
melvin cant bear the pleasure
you dont owe me that
that wasnt payment
when you first came into breakfast when i saw you i thought you were handsome
then of course you spoke
so now that your soft lil underbelly is all exposed
tell me why did you bring me
melvins voice is soft hesitant okay vulnerable
as he holds up his hands in a stop signal
thats a personal question
tell me even if youre scared
tell me why you wanted me here
she kisses him again
if you ask me
ill say yes
dissembling there are lots of reason
i had a thought that if you had sex with simon it might
humiliated sex with simon
its one idea
thats why you brought me
look at me
is that really why you brought me
like im a what and i owe you what
i dont know why i brought you that idea occurred to me is all
it came out first
hey you kiss him me
he says he loves you
you two hit it off
but you dont want to
forget what i said about sex with simon
it was a mistake
wiping away tears ill never forget you said it
it was a mistake
but she has already turned away and exits the restaurant
melvin alone and miserable
he finishes dialing
he is extremely tense not breathing a lump in his throat trying not to let the anxiety immobilize him
the number rings twice then a humorless male voice humorless male voice hi
this is fred bishop
perky womans voice and betty
fred again we are sorry to be unable to take your call right now
please leave a message and wed appreciate your including the time date and purpose of your call
simon mouths the word date then betty speaks before the beep bye bye
ah this is simon
im here in town
he waits and folks you havent come home later than in your lives
please pick up really
im going to call again in the morning
i need to see you
or at least get you to answer the phone
he hangs up
his parents want no part of him and he needs help
as carol enters with some energy
we follow her as she goes into her room takes her suitcase begins throwing things in
carol thrusts open the door and enters
was this supposed to be your room
i dont want to see him and hes not going to come knocking on your door
simon struggles with his shirt she helps him inadvertently venting some anger as she does so
can you not be violent
i dont think so
you need help with the pants
im going to take a big bath and order a big meal
are you okay
well considering everythings horrible and tomorrow i have to face my parents
dont ask me im sick of my own complaints got to get me a new set of thoughts
what have you been thinking about
how to die mostly
can you believe in our little mix youre the good roommate
simon laughs as she crosses to the bathroom and begins to prepare a bath
turning off the light good night
we are on simon settling in for sleep when instinct or sounds or the faint glow of hope turns him so that he faces the bathroom and we have
carol sitting at tubs edge a towel around her and now as simon looks at the bathing beauty she adjusts her hair the towel falls a better than perfect breast
a whisper hold it
he leaves the bed
whats he up to
he takes the blotter from the desk set and a pen from his jacket pocket which hangs on the chair and with vigor and faint pain moves to the other
side of the bed where he turns on the light and stares at carol
ive got to sketch you
im shyer than you think
i give the wrong impression sometimes and
i havent even been thinking about sketching for weeks
do a vase
but youre beautiful
your skin glows
but i just want to take a bath and
that long neck the line of you
your back goes on forever
youre why cavemen chiseled on walls
all right cut me a break
simons pen moves across the blotter carol sees him earnestly engrossed a beat of indecision and then shyly but deliberately she lowers the towel
melvin sits alone nursing a drink
hes been talking to the bartender
so then the next thing i know shes sitting right next to me and then well its not right to go into the details but i screwed up
i got nervous
i said the wrong thing and if i hadnt i could be in bed now with a woman who if you could make her smile you got a life
instead im here with you no offense a moron pushing the last legal drug
he sits there just another joe on a bar stool with his heart breaking
hes excited smiling
we hear carol also revved
i dont care how you put it were being naughty here pal
carol holding a pose for simon
he is holding a ballpoint over the back of a hotel desk blotter
his style cramped by his cast
this is great this is so great
i cant get the angle with this cast
he struggles with the cast and then decides to struggle no more
summoning remarkable strength he rips a piece from the cast freeing his hand he roars ironically a lions roar of liberation
he is back at his center
melvin is having a room service breakfast
the door opens
a new simon better than ever clearly happy a morning after glow
did you have sex with her
carol follows his out
her arms are filled with the hotel soaps shampoos etc
sorry didnt realize she was right there
a beat did you have sex with her
to hell with sex
carol looks at melvin he cant meet her gaze
we held each other
it was better than sex
what i need he gave me great
i just love her
beat howre you doing
simon finishes dialing the phone
a brief wait then hello hi mom i can barely hear you
do you have to whisper
no dont apologize it was the luckiest thing for all of us that you didnt answer last night
i cant hear you
okay dear just listen to me then
melvin has been reduced to straight talk as carol brings the bathroom bounty into the room and begins to put it in her suitcase
i get why youre angry
its no snap to explain why i was like that but lets not try to do it on the run
truly no grudges truly
a little odd that you didnt come to see me when you heard i was hurt but the important thing i want you to know is your son is happy
im working again
ill make do i dont want a thing
wouldnt take it if it was offered
ill drop you a note from wherever i land and then its up to you
i hope we patch things up but know that if we dont i wish you both the very best
i cant hear you
you heard me though right
good take good care
he hangs up totally satisfied with himself and rips over to carol and melvin
now hes going to want to stay
and theyll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever
so its a good five hours back
it gives us a chance to take it easy and
im going back with you
but what about
ill take care of myself what are you talking about
you got real problems
im a little bit nervous
suddenly everything seems so easy
carol a load has been lifted
one night with me
you think youre kidding
melvin stalks out
the car parked near a phone booth to frank over the phone aww jesus
carol walks up to simon in the car
i got a gift for you
she hands him a base ball cap
on phone nothing like no choice to make you feel at home
to simon let me see
do it then
get the dog picked up
i cant believe you let it stay there
melvin hangs up the phone
to simon well your luck is holding
they sublet your place
franks got a line on another place you can use for now
another place where
does it matter
melvin gets in goes to the glove compartment for a special cd labelled for emergency use only
as it plays a confessional love songs i dont want to hear that music right now
what do you mean
you said you liked it
this one has a special meaning
its your car but i dont want to hear it
if that means anything
melvin hesitates and then turns off the song in mid proclamation of love
as the car arrives
they get out
here are the keys to my apartment
im going to park you in my place while i take carol home
hefting bag ill take a bus
ill take you
i dont care what you did for me
i dont think i want to know you anymore all you do is make me feel badly about myself
turning to simon you have my number
hugging her i love you
sotto let him take you home
dont want to
i love you
she shakes her head and walks off
simon looking at melvin with some sympathy
dont say anything
where verdells ears prick
as they enter
i told you to go on in
look ive got to get a hold of frank and see where im hanging my hat cause
the door opens revealing them i think you gotta camp it here
what are you talking about
the dog vaults toward them all else forgotten as the dog greets his two favorite people and they talk to him
to verdell i know the feeling you feel like your ol self again huh
mommy and daddy are home
youre fun to mess with
melvin gets up
simon notices some of his paintings
they took your place furnished
jackie said she grabbed your personal stuff they were supposed to set you up here
leading the way theres this extra room i never use
it gets good light
no other answer really
as they enter
the room clean and organized a small but lovely garret
thank you melvin
you overwhelm me
they did a nice job
i love you
melvin looks at him finally pretensions fall
ill tell you buddy id be the luckiest guy alive if that did it for me
as carol unpacks she gives gifts to her mother and spencer
but clearly something gnaws at her psyche
melvins two digital clocks are two minutes apart
each around a
he sits in a chair still fully dressed
verdell in his lap
a beat then we hear simons whispered voice
where is my big hairy boy
melvin is alarmed
he stops breathing as his gay houseguest approaches
melvin breathes again
simon enters the room
sorry didnt know you were awake
i just thought verdell shouldnt get too used to sleeping in here cause then
look we both want the dog and
the phone rings
they look at each other
melvin doesnt move
should i get it
simon walks into the next room
several beats as he finds the phone
we hear him pick it up and hello
into phone hello
he took me in
did you know
hold on ill get him for you
he walks back to melvins room
as he enters
melvin is quickly out of his chair the dog in one mitt
he thrusts it at simon
take the dog
as he speeds him out
as melvin picks up the phone
he clears his throat loudly
following is intercut between carol and melvin the first such cut showing carol blasted by the throat clearing
very concerned how you doing
i can trust my brain
that seems like a good choice
i dont know whether im being sensible or hard on you
the two might go together
theres an example
i dont know whether youre being cute or crazy now
what the hell cute
you dont have to answer everything i say
just listen to me
he nods his head yes
its really something that youre looking after simon
and what i said on the street
that was a bad thing to say
and it made me sick to my stomach
it was a bad thing to say
and id be lying if i didnt say that i enjoyed your company
but the truth is you do bother me enormously and i know think that its best for me to not have contact with you because youre just not ready and
youre a pretty old guy to not be ready
and im too old to ignore that
but there were extraordinary kindnesses that did take place
so thanks for the trips
shes just broken up with him but shes being nicer than ever
its hard to know whether to die or not
okay to say something now
i shouldve danced with you
carol hangs up
she feels strange
a shoe hasnt dropped
she missed him
melvin walks in anxious circles in the living room
he is impatient
you going to come talk to me or not
we enters the room carrying verdell who strains to be allowed closer to melvin
simon releases him
what did she say
im a great guy extraordinary
before simon can celebrate and she doesnt want contact with me
a beat im dying here
gently you love her
and youre supposed to be sensitive and sharp
you tell me why mimics him youre dying here
i dont know
let me sleep on it and figure it out
then because im stuck
cant go back to what i had
shes evicted me from my life
did you like it that much
furiously it was better than this
look you im very intelligent
if youre going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope you got to be better than youre doing
if you cant be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up
im drowning and youre describing water
getting pissed picking on me wont help
well if thats true then im really in trouble
but you know where youre lucky
you know who you want
ill take your seat any day
so do something
dont sleep on it
go over there
i dont think anybody should ever sleep on anything its not always good to let things calm down
im charged here
but she might kill me for showing up this late
then get in your jammies and ill read you a story
i think youve got a chance
the only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you
one chance in whatever so go catch her off guard
thanks a lot
here i go
he moves for the door
stops suddenly jolted
i forgot to lock the door
as he parks
he exits the car now wary
looks at his watch
walks reluctantly into the apartment house
as melvin looks at carols doorbell with great uncertainty
carol in a cotton wrap around dress bathrobe
sitting directly in front of a fan
the windows open reading one of melvins books
there is the briefest possible sound of a doorbell
someone has jabbed her downstairs button ever so briefly so briefly that shes not certain its her doorbell until the same brief sound repeated
she walks to her wide open window and looks over
the convertible at the curb
she hesitates as melvin gives up and starts out
turning as the sudden blast of being buzzed into carols life sounds
he bolts for the door and enters
she opens the door
she hears the sound of melvin sounding heavily up the stairs
he reaches her side
what do you want melvin
were you asleep
what do you want
cause if you were asleep im sorry
and you could be grouchy
cause of being woken up and it would make my job impossible
so then i wouldnt even try
were you asleep
what are you doing here
beverly in the hallway looking on im sorry i woke you some other time
he half turns to leave
i wasnt asleep
what a break
losing it a bit is it a secret what youre doing here
i had to see you
it relaxes me
id feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else i can think of or imagine
carol has not ever heard anything like that before
its sort of sexy in its sincerity
as we see in the b
that beverly standing near her door down the hallway has heard at least this last part
melvin of course cannot leave well enough alone
serious wait a minute im overstating here maybe the inside stairs
i dont want to sit with my feet in the gutter
what does that serve
but suddenly carl is shouting to the heavens
why cant i have a normal boyfriend
get out of here
just a regular boyfriend who doesnt go nuts on me
butting in everybody wants that dear it doesnt exit
as carol turns to her sorry
didnt mean to interrupt
she disappears into her room
carol snorts a laugh gathers herself
oh come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you
maybe we could live without the wise cracks
she looks at him then maybe we could
melvin glances at the cracked pattern of carols kitchen linoleum and stalls at the door
it feels a little confined here
lets take a walk
its four in the morning
a walk sounds a little screwy to me if you dont mind
if you need an excuse theres a bakery on the corner
theres a shot itll open soon that way were not screwy were just two people who like warm rolls
they walk quietly melvin still walking with his usual attention to where he steps
melvin walking and though we can see an improvement it is still decidedly strange as he conspicuously avoids stepping on the lines
it is the sound of possibilities crashing down
melvin looks at her embarrassed self conscious his habits making him appear unworthy
gently almost lovingly im sorry melvin but whatever this is is not going to work
he takes this hard
it forces him to half whisper something he hasnt at all said to himself
given his history
this is an extraordinary intimacy
ive been feeling better
melvin even though it may seem that way now you dont know me all that well
as he scoffs im not the answer for you
she starts to turn
he tugs at her arm
as she turns back to him
hey ive got a great compliment for you
you know what
just let me talk
gathers himself with uncertainty then im the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that youre the greatest woman on earth
im the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do in every single thought you have
in how you are with spencer spence
he has reached her in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something thats all about being straight and good
she stands on the precipice of being transported away from the logic which has been her lifeline
i think most people miss that about you and i watch wondering how they can watch you bring them food and clear their dishes and never get that they have
just met the greatest woman alive
and the fact that i get it makes me feel great
a real question filled with concern for her you got a real good reason to walk out on that
that last question clearly a true question not the least rhetorical she considers her answer then no
its certainly not
no i dont think so
tentatively im gonna grab you
with conviction i didnt mean it to be a question
im gonna grab you
he kisses her
an awkward bomb of a kiss
a tense beat
then i know i can do better
they embrace again
he does indeed do much better
a first class smooch
camera moves down to see his foot land squarely on a crack in the sidewalk without his knowledge
they break look at each other without a notion of where to take it from here and the almost in unison begin to walk away from camera melvin following a
path that avoids cracks
suddenly the lights of the bakery turn on as it opens for business
they walk to the bakery melvin avoiding the cracks
as they enter the bakery a worker moves toward them to clean the entranceway
