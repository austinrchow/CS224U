b if window
href b b family man a line of passengers about to board a pan am flight to london
jack campbell head full of long unkempt hair tom selleck mustache the hopeful look of youth in his eyes
sitting next to
kate reynolds pretty dorothy hamill haircut
rubbing the tears from her swollen red eyes
i got you a few necessities
kate hands jack a new copy of vonneguts cats cradle
your copy was a mess
jack accepts the book but hes unable to take his eyes off kate
she hands him a cassette
every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way
all in one tape
i also put side two of london calling on there
kate leans over and kisses him passionately on the lips
that was not officially the goodbye kiss
it was just an interim kiss
he looks at her his eyes welling up
he pulls her close kissing her deeply
this will be the final boarding call for pan am flight to london heathrow
jack takes kates hand getting up turning sadly to the gate
you have your ticket
jack pulls out a blue pan am ticket envelope
they embrace and kiss again
as they separate
im not even gonna say it kate
maybe itll be like i never left
jack takes one lastlook at her then heads for the gate
kate stands there watching him go
a moment of intuition
something isnt right
she looks at jack about to disappear into the jetway trying to decide
kate approaches him
i have a bad feeling about this
about the plane
what do you think its gonna crash
dont say that
shaking her head i know weve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to london is the right thing to do
but in my heart
this feels wrong
she looks at the gate
the last few passengers are boarding then back into jacks eyes
dont go jack
you mean dont go at all
what about my internship
believe me i know what an incredible opportunity this is for you
for us kate
right for us
im afraid that if you get on that plane
kate looks at him pleading with her eyes but she cant say
im sorry you should just go
no youre right
what are we doing
were being responsible
get on the plane
his eyes narrow as he measures her determination
a smile get the hell outta my sight
you bother me
a laugh from jack
kate gives him a calm smile and a nod its not entirely convincing but its enough for jack
resolute okay im going
he takes her in his arms one last time and hugs her tight
jack looks toward the gate the line disappearing
kate grasps his shirt tightly
i cant seem to let go of you
you hear me complaining about that
a sober look in jacks eyes
look were at the airport and no one ever thinks clearly at the airport so we should just trust the decision we already made
youve been accepted to one of the best law schools in the country ive got this internship at barclays bank
we have a great plan honey
kate nods then with resolve
you want to do something great jack
lets flush the plan
start our lives right now today
i dont know what that lifes gonna look like but i do know it has both of us in it
and i choose us
jack is jolted by her words
the plan doesnt make us great jack
what we have together thats what makes us great
her words sink in
a long moment of decision
he looks toward the gate only one person left in line
back to kate
imploring him with her eyes
he kisses her deeply on the lips
i love you kate
a smile from kate
taking her face in his hands and a year in londons not gonna change that
a hundred years couldnt change that
jack gives her one final kiss then walks pensively to the gate handing the attendant his ticket not able to look back
kate watches him go tears streaming down her face as the gate door closes behind him
she waits almost willing it to open again
but it doesnt
the skating rink at central park
christmas tree at rockefeller center
the view down fifth avenue with christmas decorations
we close in on a spectacular pre war doorman building
a huge space with gleaming hardwood floors ornate moldings and a great view of the hudson and jersey behind it
the place looks like a museum display
everything is of the highest quality and meticulously maintained
a wall of photos jack and clinton jack with patrick ewing jack between alan greenspan and henry kravis
and a willie mays baseball bat encased in glass
impeccably decorated and obsessively neat
close in on the bed where jack campbell now sans mustache and long hair opens his eyes
a flash of bright morning light from the window
jack shields his eyes turning his head toward the bathroom where he sees
a womans back
draped in a towel
an incredible back neither flabby nor overly toned beautifully curved
jack focuses on it a moment
as the woman turns to him
beautiful late s a toothbrush in her mouth
holding up toothbrush i hope you dont mind
there were like ten new ones in the cabinet
a playful smile from paula
its not what you think
i took mentadent public
paula smiles moves over to a chair and grabs a little black dress hanging neatly over it
did you really mean what you said about tuscany
of course i did
last night was great
you are an amazing lover
you should be giving motivational seminars
youre not bad yourself
jack grabs his frank mueller watch from the night stand puts it on his wrist
he looks at paula as she slips the dress on
i want to see you again

she turns to him
its christmas eve jack
so well get egg nog
putting on her shoes i have to go to my parents house out in jersey

paula approaches jack leaning over him her long hair dangling on his chest
dont you have anywhere to go
ive got plenty of places to go
he stays there confident sexy waiting for an answer
a sexy laugh then
maybe i can try and sneak away some time tomorrow morning
kissing him on the lips okay
coy if its something you feel strongly about
paula walks to the door then turns back to jack
it was nice meeting you jack
jack saunters over to a yamaha grand disclavier in the living room
he puts a disk into the piano and
the keys come alive with the music of bach
jack hits a switch and suddenly the entire apartment is enveloped in music
paula waiting for the elevator hears the music emanating from jacks apartment
an intrigued glance back at the apartment door as the elevator arrives
backs passion according to st
matthew is blaring through the speakers the music is swelling to full orchestra
jacks at the mirror in this incredibly neat marble tiled bathroom shaving with a silver plated hammacher schlemmer razor humming with the orchestra
the size of a small house a long row of zegna suits shoe trees stacked with italian shoes tailored shirts everywhere
jacks still humming to the music as he dresses in front of a mirror
jack wearing an elegant camels hair overcoat and carrying a leather briefcase a master of the universe smile on his face now humming the bach piece from memory
the doors open at
jack self consciously stops singing as elizabeth peterson s wearing a mink coat gets on the elevator carrying a yappy little dog
a charming smile mrs
you dont have to stop singing on my account
its because im shy betty
so when are you going to leave that old corpse mr
peterson and run away with me
you know you could never satisfy me the way he does
the doors open to the lobby
peterson walks out ahead
tony the doorman holds the door open for jack and mrs
merry christmas mr
howd you do this year tony
about four grand
and a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from mrs
johnson in d
im putting it all in commercial paper like you said
just until the deutsche mark turns
jack exits the building
jacks ferrari racing through the park
a modern wall street building
the sign above the glass doors reads p
lassiter and associates investment house
the ferrari screeches to a halt
jack gets out heads into the building
jack throws his keys to a nearby security guard with a smile on his way to the elevators
the manhattan skyline shines through the windows of this beautiful conference room
six executives are seated at a huge oak table littered with coffee cups and lunch waste
at the end of the table alan mintz s balding sits with a faraway look in his eyes three empty diet coke cans in front of him
mintz is poking at a shiny gold cherub dangling from a small plastic christmas tree sitting in the middle of the table
jack is addressing the group from the front of the room standing in front of a computer with a huge flat screen monitor covered with stock charts and tables
if medtechs shares sink any lower than
casually executing a keystroke forty three were in trouble with the stock valuation
so for gods sake watch what you say to your institutional customers
jack notices alan mintz playing with the cherub
we still have almost a full day of trading before zero hour and i dont want any trouble
distracted by mintz penny for your thoughts alan
alan looks up
i told dee and the kids id be home by dinner
you know it being christmas eve and all
is that tonight
a laugh from the group
jack approaches alan
you think i like being here on christmas eve alan
i dont know
even jack lets out a good natured chuckle
okay maybe i do have a touch of tunnel vision this holiday season
but in two days were going to announce one of the largest mergers in u
thirty billion dollars
basking in the glory when this kind of deal turns up you get on and you ride it till its over
you dont ask it for a vacation
a chuckle from the group
the esprit de corps seems to energize jack
to the group december th
after that therell be so much money floating around here itll be like christmas every day
smiling december th people
if youd like to celebrate that day you all have my blessing
enthusiastic nods and words of agreement from the suits around the table
youre right jack
jack approaches alan
i dont want you to be sorry alan i want you to be excited
i want my gift to be the first one you open this year
you know why
because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end
a murmur of excitement in the room even alan cracks a smile
jack puts a hand on alans shoulder
the conference room door opens and the six energized suits emerge each met by an assistant handing them messages
jack is the last one out
hes met in stride by adelle s carrying a filofax and a pile of phone messages
only eight thirty
whats the matter had some last minute shopping to do
jack pops a peppermint lifesaver in his mouth as adelle hands him his messages
this holidays about giving adelle
and im giving everything ive got to this deal so in a way im more christmassy than anyone
holding out the candy lifesaver
ignoring the candy youre a ray of sunshine jack
they approach an office the words jack campbell president stenciled on the glass
continuing past adelles desk jack looking at his messages and into jacks office
a cavernous office you could land a helicopter in it high tech fixtures full bar leather sofa stairmaster
jack walks to an enormous bare mahogany desk and sits down in a high tech ergonomic leather chair
oh and oxxford called
ooh my suits are ready
he gets to the last message sees the name on it and reels back
her assistant said you could call her at home after eight
jack stares at the message like hes looking at a ghost
yeah jack her assistant
lost in the message kate reynolds was my girlfriend in college
i almost married her
a hearty laugh you
snapping out of it almost married
and almost a junior broker at e
she didnt want me to go to london
were standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay
so you left her
just like that
i thought about it for practically the entire flight
stop jack im getting all weepy
i took the road less traveled adelle
and look where its led you
picking up the phone im gonna get her on the phone
jack pauses focused on the message his mind drifting back
adelle begins dialing the number
finally jack reaches out and hangs up the phone
you almost married this woman
arent you even curious what she wants
shes probably just having a fit of nostalgia
you know lonely christmas eve call the one that got away that kind of thing
adelle rolls her eyes at him
im telling you its ancient history
jack looks up as peter lassiter s founder and chairman of p
lassiter and associates saunters into the room
eight forty five on christmas eve and jack campbell is still at his desk
theres a hallmark moment for you
lassiter heads to the bar like hes done it a million times
i dont see you rushing home to trim the tree
pouring himself a scotch thats because im a heartless bastard who only cares about money
and god love you for it
lassiter drops down in a soft leather chair opposite jack
sipping the scotch i just got a call from terry haight
bob thomas is nervous
thatll happen when youre about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin
someones gonna have to nurse him through this
why are you staring at my breasts peter
i need you tiger
where is he
jack pauses for a beat
to adelle call aunt irma
tell her i wont be able to make it tomorrow
adelle rolls her eyes at him
youre a credit to capitalism jack
jack glances at adelle then looks back at lassiter
hey peter lemme ask you a question
an old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on christmas eve
you suddenly having trouble getting dates
not by a long shot
then leave it in the past
old flames are like old tax returns
you keep em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut em loose
jack shoots adelle a satisfied smile crumpling up kates message and tossing a perfect hook into a n
to adelle ill leave from the office tomorrow afternoon
call the group
schedule an emergency strategy session for noon
thatll be a nice little holiday treat
a single light remains on in the building
jack is alone in the office working on his computer checking spreadsheets on a large flat screen monitor
jack leans back in his chair rubbing his eyes
he checks his watch
its past eleven
he gets up goes to the window sees the city in all its christmas glory then he see it
the message from kate crumpled in the trashcan
then turns back to the window gazing out at the night
jack comes out of the elevator walking past the lobby desk where frank a security guard sits watching the monitors
why didnt you call down i wouldve had joe get your ride
jack looks outside the front door to the snowy quiet street
im thinking i might walk tonight frank
nice night for it
ill have louis send your car home
a nod from jack
merry christmas to you sir
to you too
jack puts on a pair of soft leather gloves and heads out into the crisp night air
jack emerges from the building walking across the large plaza past the fountain
snow begins to fall
jacks walking down the nearly empty street snow falling down on him a bounce in his step looking at the windows of the closed shops along the way
he gets to the end of the block spots the wong brothers hour deli across the street
he heads toward it
jack walks into the brightly lit deli
sam wong s is with his year old grandfather behind the counter
theres a nerdy college kid at the salad bar a drunken department store santa at the liquor display a woman with a baby in an aisle and
a black man s with a dollar sign and the name cash tattooed on his arm stands in front of the coffee machine
yeah yee ah
shes a certified winner
paper thin but good as gold
jack notices cash talking to himself seemingly crazy
jack approaches sam wong at the counter
pointing dairy case
in the b
to sam wong yall do the lotto here
cause i got me a winner
i know i know lotto keeps the black man down
but not me
jack grabs a carton of egg nog then notices cash handing sam wong his ticket
jack heads back toward the counter
thats two hundred and thirty eight dollar
a smile merry christmas and shit
barely looking at ticket ticket bad
you draw in lines with pencil
whatre you talkin about
throwing the ticket back you draw lines with pencil
i know about this
the woman with the baby looks over
the college kid looks up nervous
the drunken santa bottle of bourbon in hand starts to walk by jack
jack instinctively puts an arm out holding the santa back
look at the ticket
get out i call
the santa looks at jack confused
youre lookin at me youre not even lookin at the ticket
the woman with the baby puts a loaf of bread back on the shelf starts nervously inching toward the door
you leave now
take ticket somewhere else
calling out next customer in line
you first generation xenophobic money theistic hot pastrami sandwich making
screaming get out
cash shoves the ticket in sam wongs face
a moment of decision for jack
carefully let me see that ticket
cash turns to jack
menacing was i talkin to you
jack looks at the woman the college kid the santa then
maybe ill buy it from you
now cash walks over to jack
guy in suit gets ass kicked tryin to be a hero
film at eleven
turning to the coffee machine what
oh no not another lookie loo
you know how big a job this is
the patrons exchange nervous glances
jack watches confused
youre double bookin me
youre gonna get double billed
cash throws a bottle of perrier against the wall it shatters
the woman reels back in terror with the baby
in a flash cash whips a
from the back of his pants aiming it at jacks face
the woman screams covers her baby
in jacks face do you want to die
jack stares at cash trying his best to keep his cool
a smile yes you do
look im talking about a business deal here
i buy the ticket for two hundred take it to a store where the guy behind the counter
glaring at sam wong doesnt have a death wish back to cash i just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars
cash gets closer
like i said its a business deal
damn you are the real thing
cash narrows his eyes
then a smile as he puts the gun back into his pants
cmon jack lets get outta here
to sam wong you were lookin at me papa you shoulda been lookin at the ticket
that ticket was legit b
cash starts out of the deli
jack and cash walking down the street
jack holding his carton of egg nog under his arm counting out two hundred dollars
howd you know my name was jack
i call all you white guys jack
you know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him
theres no way i was gonna die in that deli
off cashs look lets just say ive been on a lucky streak lately
a big laugh a lucky streak huh
jack hands him the money
sound pretty sure of yourself dont you
so youre telling me youve got a gun to your head and you dont think for one second what if this what if that maybe i shouldnt do this i
shoulda done that
i dont do that
thats just not for me
cash looks at him then smiles
nice doing business with you
cash is about to take off
cash turns around
what do you want to carry that gun around for anyway
youre just gonna do something youll regret
you want to talk about regrets youre talking to the wrong person
jack casually takes the egg nog out of the bag opens the carton
im just saying that you seem like a smart guy
at a certain point youre gonna do something and then theres no turning back
yeah in most cases thatd be true
jack takes a sip of the egg nog
i mean there must be programs out there opportunities
a deep laugh wait a minute wait a minute
youre tryin to save me
a look from jack
oh man youre serious
out to the street this man thinks i need to be saved
everyone needs something
cash looks at jack
what do you need
you just said everyone needs something
ive got everything i need
it must be great being you
you got it all
cash looks at jack
he smiles and shakes his head
look im not saying youd be able to do it without some hard work
a hearty laugh you still think this is about me dont you
sure its about you
but its about society too
oh man im gonna enjoy this one
just remember jack you did this
you brought this on yourself
and with that cash turns and leaves jack alone on the street with his egg nog
jack walks in and throws his keys on a table
he takes off his gloves and overcoat glances at the mail then heads into the bedroom
through the large windows we see snow falling
jack flat on his back in bed fast asleep
close in on jacks face bathed in morning light
he opens his eyes
feels something strange
jack looks down
theres a womans head resting on his chest
a look of confusion crosses his face
trying to remember
did he meet a woman last night
he turns his head to find a large mutt sitting faithfully beside the bed wagging his tail
did she have a dog
he looks down at the woman again craning his neck to get a look at her face
and then he sees her
now and even more beautiful a look of utter contentment on her radiant face sleeping soundly
his head darts around the room its cramped and lived in clothes and toys are strewn about family photos on the dresser laura ashley curtains a tiny poster bed and
a charming little bay window
he instinctively reaches for his franck mueller watch on the night stand but its not there
its a timex indiglo and it reads a
jack looks back at kate
he rubs his eyes
maybe its a dream
but nothing changes
then kate stirs
ten more minutes jack
jack jumps as he hears kate talk for the first time
suddenly the door bursts open
a six year old girl annie in a little nightgown walks into the room carrying an month old boy josh singing at the top of her lungs
jingle bells santa s mells rudolph laid an egg
la la la la la la la la la la la la
annie places josh on the bed and then jumps up herself
she gestures to the dog patting the bed
you too luce
the dog faithfully jumps on the tiny bed joining everybody else and leaving very little room
annie starts jumping
stirring youre jumping sweetheart
jack looks at this activity like a man at his own funeral
mom dont you think we need to open the presents
groggy mommy needs five more minutes in la la land
that could be her present
josh crawls directly up to jacks stomach climbing on
she said dad
jack moves the baby gingerly over then gets out of bed stumbling over a baseball bat lying next to it
he picks up the bat
the same willie mays autograph bat that was encased in glass in his n
frightened jack drops the bad looking down at himself for the first time
a mortified look on his face as he sees the kids on the bed
he quickly grabs a pair of sweat pants and a yellow cardigan off the chair and throws them on
kate still half asleep reaches out her hand
jack turns by instinct
kate grabs him drawing him near
a look of fear on his face as kate opens her eyes
jacks certain hes about to hear her scream
still groggy strong coffee okay
she lets him go as jack backs out the door
a garishly decorated christmas tree sits in the middle of this messy and disorganized living room a bevy of gifts underneath and four red stockings over the fireplace
jack darts to the top of the steps
calling from the bedroom use an entire can if you have to
he looks back at the bedroom then at the stairs
quickly heading down the creaky steps still in shock
he grabs an overcoat from a hook by the front door
about to step out when he looks down and realizes
he glances at a pair of rubber over boots sitting by the door slips them on just about to leave when
he hears the sound of a key turning in the door lock
jack looks at the door not quite sure what to do
the door opens
into the house arms laden with wrapped gifts walk big ed and lorraine reynolds both s kates parents
big eds wearing a ten gallon hat and a suede overcoat
lorraine has a cigarette dangling from her mouth
drawing on a memory ed
big ed hugs jack as best he can with an armful of gifts
jack you ol bird dog
merry christmas to ya
lorraine plants a big fat kiss on jacks cheek
talk to him jack
one day a year away from the ponderosa
i dont think thats too much to ask
i heard that
this is who i am woman
a wink to jack tell her jack
youre the only one who gets me for gods sake
jack still holding the door open plotting his escape
i need some egg nog

hell its almost a
shouting upstairs where are my two lil pardners
giddy up bid eds here
jack dashes out the door
where are you going jack
to big ed wheres he going

they start to remove their coats when
the door flies back open
wheres my car
wheres my ferrari
what the hell are you talking about
to lorraine whats he talking about

i promise itll be returned
why dont you take your own damn car
oh just let him borrow your precious cadillac for gods sake
jack spots a set of keys hanging on a hook
hes got a perfectly good mini van sitting out there in the driveway
jack grabs the keys off the hook
darts back outside
jack emerges from this charming suburban two story house some tasteful christmas lights decorating a tree in the center of the snow covered lawn
he races to a blue dodge mini van sitting in the driveway a my ferrari is in the shop sticker on the rear bumper
he climbs into the mini van and peels out of the driveway
jack sees a sign george washington bridge miles
jack driving over the bridge
a sigh of relief as he passes under a sign for manhattan
the mini van pulls up near jacks apartment building
jack still wearing pajamas under the coat leaps out running toward the grand entrance where tony stands sternly in front
tony thank god
jack starts to walk past but tony blocks the way
entrance is for residents and guests only
what are you talking about
its me jack campbell
i put you into commercial paper
not moving uh huh
just then mrs
peterson walks to the door with her little dog
tony opens the door for her
the little dog starts barking ferociously at jack
to tony re jack annoyed who is this man
tony shrugs his shoulders
you know me betty
were on the co op board together
we fought side by side for garbage disposals
every morning we exchange quasi sexual witty banter
she looks at jack with a raised eyebrow the dog still to mrs
peterson should i call the cops
im gonna call the cops
jack pleads to her with his eyes
raising a hand to tony no
a sigh of relief thank you betty
i know if i can just sleep this off ill be fine
and sleep you shall
noblesse oblige is not dead
not yet anyway
come lets get you some help
surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city
im the richest guy in the building
ive got twice the square footage you have
peterson shakes her head at him a look of pity on her face
frustrated jack turns and runs back to the mini van
jack pulls up across the street and gets out of the van
running across the empty plaza toward the building entrance
jack bursts through the door approaching the lobby desk where frank the security guard sits
frank spots jack and blocks his way
whoa whoa whoa
hold it right there
wheres alan mintz
is he here yet
a knowing chuckle i dont think so
buildings closed pal
youll have to come back tomorrow
look i dont know whats going on here but i am senior vice president of this company
i dont care who you are
its christmas and like i told you the building is closed
maybe youre not hearing me
i am jack campbell
approaching the building directory right here
jack campbell president
and then he sees it
alan mintz president listed plain as day on the building director
jack looks at frank then back to the building directory
a pitying look from frank
jack stands there in shock
jack walks through the plaza like a zombie his face registering nothing
he crosses the street moving toward the mini van
a ferrari m stops within inches of jacks torso
a voice from the car
watch where youre walking
sees the driver low in the seat
cant quite make out the face
you almost dented my two hundred thousand dollar car
looks at the car very familiar
the voice of the driver also familiar
my new cars worth more than your shitty house
a look of realization on jacks face
i feel like i really did win the lottery
its cash and hes in jacks car
jack moves over to the passenger window in shock
a smile from cash
miss me jack
thats my car
you stole my car
its a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by laws of your alt fate contract
basically its my car now
cash reaches over and opens the door
look i dont make the rules jack
this is how it works
cash gives him a reassuring look
jack gets in
jack closes the door
cash joyfully drives off in a burst of acceleration
jack practically ends up in the back seat
might wanna fasten your seat belt jack
recovering what the hell is happening to me
jacks freaking out and cash is enjoying every minute of it
cash hands jack a paper bag
jack starts breathing into the bag
this kinda thing makes a lotta guys throw up
seen it happen
so if you get the urge do it out the window
with a taunting laugh i dont want you marring this exquisite leather interior
cash looks over at jack
hes really losing it sobbing into the bag
look i dont know what youre getting so worked up about you did this
you brought this on yourself
brought what on myself
i didnt do anything
ive got everything i need i dont have regrets thats just not for me
you mean because you thought i was cocky im now on a permanent acid trip
cash gets a laugh out of jacks overreaction
everyone else in that store is a statue they see their lives passing in front of their eyes but not you
youre making a business deal
enraged give me my goddamn life back
what about me
im working hard for you here jack
on christmas too
now you did a good thing last night intervening that way
i was moved
just tell me whats happening to me
in plain english
none of that mumbo jumbo
cash turns to jack
its a glimpse jacko
a glimpse of what
look eventually everybody gets one
some of em take a couple seconds
looking at jack some of em take a lot longer
i asked you a direct question
a glimpse of what
a look from cash
figure it out
you got plenty of time
how much time
as long as it takes to figure it out
which in your case could be considerable
look i just want my life back
now whats it gonna take
you wanna talk turkey
lets talk turkey
how much money
cash looks at jack relishing the moment
he flashes jack a smile
do i look like i need your money
it doesnt work like that and i cant tell you why
because you got to figure it out for yourself
beat are you listening to me
figure it out
figure what out
cash just stares at him
thats all i get
look jack in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it
let it come to you
jack faces cash simmering
look i dont have time for this right now
im in the middle of a deal
oh youre working on a new deal now
did i mention that
you know what
ive had it with you
ive had it with all of this shit
cash slams on the brakes
practically sending jack through the windshield
jack recovers looks up
the car is parked right next to the mini van
cash pulls out a small plastic bag holding it out to jack
jack looks inside the bag pulls out a barbie bicycle bell
he looks at it curiously
whats this a signal
will you come whenever i ring it
do i look like i live in a bottle
cash reaches across jack and opens the door
lost but what do i do
look jack im late
id love to help you out some more but i gotta go handle my business
gesturing to the mini van happy trails
jack looks out to the lonely street outside then back to cash
hey you did this to me you cant just leave me like this
cash looks at jack the desperation on his face
you want to know everything ill tell you everything
but not here
lets get some air
jacks still a little unsure
he sees cash open the driver side door
relieved thanks man
jack gets out of the car
and before he can even turn around cashs door slams shut and the car takes off in a blast of horsepower
jack stands there gazing down the street listening to the sound of the ferrari shifting gears disappearing
the wind whips up
shivering jack looks toward the lassiter building then to the plastic bag in his hand and finally to the mini van
the blue mini van snakes through the curved streets of the neighborhood almost all the houses decorated for christmas
jacks trying to find the house a map unfolded on the steering wheel and the cars registration in his hand
he spots arnie bender late s carrying an empty science kit box to the trash
his wife jeannie also late s is getting in a ford taurus wagon a bowl of fruit in hand
jack pulls up to the curb near arnie rolling down the window
do you know where merrison street is
arnie looks up and sees jack in the van
turning to his wife jeannie
i found jack
jack follows arnie into the den of this garishly decorated suburban home arnies arm around his shoulder
you look terrible
jack takes in the decor its a male leisure time fantasy old pinball machine wide screen tv dart board and kitschy s style bamboo bar
truth is i expected you
kate called before and asked if i knew where you were
arnie notices jacks fascination with the room
i know i moved the barca lounger into the corner
its throwin everybody off
what do you think
with a nod great room
a satisfied smile from arnie jacks approval means something to him
you and me buddy
we know how to live
arnie shepherds jack onto a bar stool and pours a drink out of a bamboo bottle holder
so jack you okay
jack doesnt respond his eyes drawn to a softball team photo on the bar
jack and arnie kissing a huge trophy with the caption plainfield n
softball league champs
i mean you leave the house on christmas morning you dont tell anyone where youre going
jack looks over from the photo to arnie
were friends arent we
maybe i dont say it enough but you moving in next door to me
arnie makes a fist and gestures to his heart
talk to me
a moment of decision for jack as arnie stands there open eyed ready to listen
im having kind of a bad day
nodding i read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays
a raised eyebrow from jack
to himself what am i saying
you dont need to hear that
back to jack all i meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie thats all
is that you
trouble at work
i dont think so
its not kate is it
jack pauses at the mention of kate
arnies eyes widen
proudly you see its like were in each others heads
kates my wife
jack looks at arnie as if hes seeking confirmation
a playful smile just keep saying it jack like a mantra
arnie comes out from behind the bar taking jack by the arm
cmon i better walk ya home
shes mad enough as it is right
arnie walks jack through his backyard
look you fit the profile exactly
thirties house kids financial responsibilities
you start thinking
this isnt the life i dreamt about
wheres the romance wheres the joie de vivre
suddenly every lingerie ad in the newark star ledger represents a life you cant have
its just two kids right
a chuckle from arnie
you made a choice jack a promise to your wife
maybe sometimes it seems like you gave up the world but look what you got
they arrive at
the backyard of the campbell house
cluttered with a swing set a dog run with chewed up lawn and a wooden sun deck in the process of being built
four bedrooms two and a half baths and a partially finished basement
jack trips over a wayward big wheel
shaking his head kids
arnie leads jack toward the house
okay look you probably dont want to hear this right now but remember what you told me last summer when i almost had that thing with arnie jr
s speech therapist
a blank stare from jack as they arrive at the sliding glass door
arnie faces jack squarely grabbing his shoulders and looking him in the eye
dont screw up the best thing in your life just because youre a little unsure about who you are
arnie gives jack a comforting smie
god it feels so good to finally give something back to you
arnie turns jack toward the door and slides it open
im gonna hug you now
arnie gives jack a gentle hug
then gives him a little push toward the door
jack steps inside
he turns back to the door but arnies gone
then kate enters the room holding a portable phone
into phone hold on a second
she cups the receiver
jack looks at her shes dressed now nothing fancy but she looks great
you cut your hair
a curious look from kate
ten years ago
kate just stands there looking at jack giving away nothing
are you okay
she gives him a resolute nod then
into phone never mind he just walked in
jack grimaces as she resolutely hangs up the phone then stares him down angrily
do you have any idea what you put us through today
you walk out of here at in the morning dont tell me where youre going or even that youre going and i dont see you til hours later
i had state troopers looking for you
i called hospitals
pointing at the phone i was just on the phone with the morgue for gods sake
jack watches her vent the frustration on his face building
what kind of man leaves his family on christmas morning without a word about where hes going
jacks almost to a breaking po int
what kind of man does that
jumping in i dont know
please stop yelling at me
she looks at him curiously
where were you
i was in the city
new york city
because thats where i live
dont even start
look you dont understand
i woke up here
and this is very strange
this is not my house
a raised eyebrow from kate
jack moves around the room
pointing upstairs im not dad
kate youre not my wife
kate looks him over assessing then
you know what jack
its not funny this time
im really angry
she stares him down expecting an answer
but he has no answer
jack takes the bell out of the plastic bag that cash gave him holds it up in front of her and starts ringing it furiously
annie rides into the room on her new bike
re bell whats that
jack watches as she pedals over reaches into his hand and takes the bicycle bell
examining the bell i like this
jumping up and giving hima peck on the cheek thanks dad
annie rides excitedly out of the room on her bike
leaving jack and kate alone again
you missed the whole thing jack
the pancakes the presents
you spent six hours putting that bike together and you didnt even get to see the look on annies face when she opened it
jack sees the disappointment on her face
you missed christmas jack
jack looks down almost ashamed
he relents giving in to the moment
kate looks at him
he seems sincere enough
look we dont have time for this right now well talk about it later
now get dressed
pointing to his outfit youre not wearing that to the thompsons party
i dont care how hilarious you think it is
oh no i cant go to a party
you look forward to this party all year
whats with you today
trust me on this kate
i really dont think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time
kate looks at him a moment then shakes her head
do whatever you want
she picks up the phone starts dialing
what are you doing
telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids
because youll be here
kate just looks at him
ill be ready in ten minutes
he walks past her
toward a hallway door kate watching him
he opens the door
its a closet
turning around where the hell is the bathroom
im laughing on the inside
the light comes on
jack walks in looks in the mirror determined to collect himself
but somethings not right
he glances around
the bathroom is small and its cluttered with kates razors loofah skin creams
none of this stuff is his
he looks in the mirror again his face revealing a forlorn sense of displacement
he stares at himself until
he starts to lose it
finally he begins breaking down
after a moment he turns on the water rinsing his face
jack at the closet door looking at a row of hagar slacks docker sport coats and imitation leather shoes
he reaches in and touches the fabric on one of the sport coats
this is just
searching for the words this is sub par
annie appears at the bedroom door watching jack at the closet
sees annie watching him
a look exchanged
then annie runs away
jack turns back to the closet and mournfully takes a pair of the slacks
jack and kate a casserole dish in her hand walk up the path to this tacky but large house its outside decorated with the most garish display of christmas decorations
this side of pasaic
kate rings the doorbell
evelyn thompson s wearing a dress thats a bit too tight and a bit too low cut opens the door
turning around to guests everybody jack and kate are here
jack looks right past her
to the house filled with a loud whoop from the guests
jack has the look of a condemned man on his face as he follows kate inside
as kate heads into the living room evelyn takes jacks arm
suggestively like the dress
glancing at it its lovely
a satisfied smile i thought i saw you notice it at the kids recital
jack shoots her a confused look
then walks in trying to catch up with kate
the party is in full swing christmas music in the b
guests talking laughing drinking egg nog
jacks eyes dart around the room
its large neater than his and kates house but still very lived in
the thompson kids run in and out of the room playing with new toys
nobody is wearing or eating anything imported from europe but everyones having a good time
everyone except for jack standing with arnie and the guys having his ear chewed off by nick carelli a walking advertisement for levis cotton dockers
did you see van horn last night
this kids gonna single handedly save basketball in the state of new jersey
youre kidding right
nick looks at him in disbelief
theyre certainly due
bill kramer a huge pile of fried chicken wings on his plate tugs at jacks shirt
so tomorrows the big day jackie
im going under the knife
i told you didnt i
pointing to his plate you really think you should be eating all that
i figure im going in for a cleaning tomorrow i might as well load up on the fried stuff tonight
good thinking bill
have another drink
whispering to jack hell be lucky if he lives through the night
nick reaches into his pocket and pulls out a packet of dutch masters cigars
he shows them to jack jack nods politely
nick eagerly hands him one
nick lights jacks cigar then his own
enjoying that first puff
smiling at jack
jack dutifully takes a puff of the cigar
nods back at nick
but its an effort
evelyn thompson approaches a tray of mushroom puffs in hand
holding out a puff to jack finger food
i dont think so thank you
suggestively cmon as soon as i put them down youre gonna grab a couple
you always do
kate sees evelyn and jack from her position on the other side of the room
kate watches as
evelyn holds the puff up to jacks mouth slowly putting it near his lips
theyll melt in your mouth
he instinctively opens his mouth as evelyn pushes the treat inside
on jacks face
if freezer burn were a facial expression this would be it
forcing a smile theyre great
evelyn licks her fingers suggestively then hands jack the entire tray with a sexy smile
a raised eyebrow from kate still watching
mushroom puffs arent the only thing i do well
well do whatever it is you do well and just
just do it
evelyn nods as jack walks toward the staircase
kate follows jack with her eyes as he climbs the stairs
jack is sitting on the arm of a couch filled with guests coats talking on a football shaped telephone
the tray of mushroom puffs on the table
loudly into phone what do you mean he wont come to the phone
standing indignant do you realize how much money ive made for that sonuvabitch in the last eight years
a dial tone
jack slams the phone down
he slams the phone again
jack turns sees kate standing in the doorway watching him take his frustrations out on the phone concern on her face
are you sure youre okay
a forced smile from jack
yes im fine
its just this god awful football phone
who has a phone like this anyway
doubtful uh huh
kate notices the tray of mushroom puffs on the table
you must really love evelyns mushroom puffs huh
with a wink you know theyre not real
she turns and leaves
jack looks at her confused
jack comes down the stairs a lost look in his eyes
he looks across the room and sees
kate with a group of guests looking great in her jeans and white blouse the center of attention
jack passes through the guests people waving to him slapping him on the back as he approaches kate
he catches kates eye
she gives him a subtle smile
to guests then she asks me to put this sweater on
what choice do i have right
jack watches as kate charms the crowd
but as im slipping it on i notice shes misspelled the word lawyers
laughing i had to go through the entire day wearing a hand embroidered sweater that said non profit layers do it for free
the guests laugh again
even jack finds himself laughing until
to kate off hand so youre a lawyer
a chuckle from the group
a non profit lawyer
people are starting to laugh
a little embarrassed jack
you dont get paid at all
nobody makes a dime
blank stares from everyone including kate
kate and jack walk in the front door
the dog greets them happily jumping up on jack a weary look on his face
i better go wake my mother
kate grabs a leash off a hook and hands it to jack
here you go
youre kidding me
shes your dog jack
no shes not
fine shes the kids dog
lets go wake josh see if he wants to walk her
but its twenty degrees outside
sympathetic youre having a bad day ill go with you
actually theres no way in hell youre gettin me back out there
jack looks at the dogs face
lucy couldnt be more excited
finally jack shakes his head and takes the leash
heading up the stairs make sure you reward her verbally when she does a number two
the sound of crickets
jack wearing a down jacket is being dragged down the street by lucy his breath condensing in the cold winter air
the dog sniffs at a hydrant and a couple of garbage cans but isnt doing her business
figure it out
im s crewed
dont have to be a genius to figure that out
the dog stops sniffing at a manicured lawn
to lucy its as good a place as any
but the dog keeps moving pulling jack with her
but obviously not up to your high standards
to himself okay
he said youre working on a new deal now
fine youve done a thousand deals whats the first thing you do
lucys sniffing around someones christmas display but jacks too wrapped up in his thought process to notice
its your signature
you survey the damage find out everything you can you probe leave nothing to chance
im just gonna have to go detective
how did you get mentadent
you learned everything there was to know about toothpaste and then you pounced
jack narrows his eyes thinking about that deal
thats our play here
resolute jack turns to the dog
if you could take a dump some time in this century then we could go home where its warm
jack looks around at the unfamiliar houses
that is if i can even remember how to get home
to lucy you remember dont you girl
but the dog ignores him dragging jack along
kate is in bed fast asleep
jack walks into the room his face still red from the cold outside
he looks over at kate sleeping happily
he takes off his shirt and khakis laying them neatly on the chair
he looks over at the pair of flannel pajamas folded on the dresser
he shakes his head resigned then dons the pajamas and climbs into bed
morning light streams into the room
the clock reads
jack opens his eyes a burst of light hitting them from the window
like the morning light in his manhattan loft
he reaches across the bed
a smile of hope from jack as he puts his head back on the pillow
maybe it was only a day
the sound of a baby crying from the next room
a pained look on jacks face as he realizes hes still in jersey
now the baby is wailing
jack lies still a moment hoping itll stop
then he hears the sound of the shower turn on in the bathroom
he gets out of bed and walks to the bathroom
the shower is running a tape player is blasting beast of burden
kate is in the shower singing loudly with the song
louder over music hello
singing my feet are hurtin
yelling finally the music is turned down and kate pulls the shower curtain open
jack sees her naked body
raises an eyebrow
thats something hes missed
that babys crying
her expression makes jack turn his gaze from her naked body
dont give me that look jack tuesdays your day and you know it
and try to get josh to day care on time okay
he missed the macaroni painting last week
she closes the curtain and turns the radio back up
annies watching from a baby size laz e boy lounger as
jack in a robe stands in front of a changing table josh laying happily on his back playing with a set of plastic keys
jack takes a fresh huggies diaper and puts it next to the baby
he surveys josh scratching his chin and rubbing his hands like indiana jones
josh playfully grabs at jacks nose
he looks over to annie
shes still staring at him like hes a martian
he looks at the instructions on the box of huggies
jack searches the diaper for the tabs of tape then gingerly pulls them apart releasing the diaper from the babys bottom and seeing whats inside
holy mother of god
jack holds the diaper out away from him searching for a place to put it
annie points to a diaper genie by the dresser
jack throws the diaper in then quickly replaces the lid
annie points to the container of baby wipes
you must be kidding
annie stares at him a beat
youre not really our dad are you
jack turns to her
shes looking back at him with complete earnestness
they stare at each other another moment
no im not
a look of curiosity from annie
i work on wall street you know with the big buildings
no response from annie
i live in an apartment house with a doorman i can buy just about anything i want
annie nods at jack still suspicious
this isnt my real life
its just a glimpse
wheres my real dad
i dont know
a concerned look on annies face jacks petrified that shes about to cry
but dont worry he loves you and im sure hell be back very soon
to himself very very soon
annie approaches jack climbing up on a little chair and tugging firmly at his hair
they did a pretty good job
in the mother ship
you look just like him
slightly better looking though right
annies now stone faced trying to decide about jack
youre not going to start crying are you
because im not really sure i could deal with that right now
she thinks about it for a moment
do you like kids
on a case by case basis
you know how to make chocolate milk
i think i could figure it out
you promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains
a smile from annie
welcome to earth
jacks driving annie buckled in the front seat
josh in the baby seat looks like he was dressed by monkeys his shirt buttons are off by one and theyre clearly supposed to be in the back
jack stops the van outside the playland day care center
this is day care
its where babies go when their parents are at work
he gets out of the van
he pulls josh out and walks quickly toward the building holding the baby away from his body
he gets to the door and holds josh out to the day care lady
she stares at joshs outfit
do i get a receipt or something
the woman looks at jack like hes crazy
the mini van pulls up to the drop off point at this suburban new jersey y
annie opens the door
i have winter camp until four then ballet until five thirty
try not to be late because kids dont like to be the last one picked up
jack watches her as she runs toward the building
calling out window hey
annie turns back toward him
where do i go now
big eds tires
thats where you work
you mean i sell tires
she shrugs her shoulders and walks off
thats what i do
im a tire salesman
jacks driving down a busy commercial street when he spots something a hundred yards down the road
a huge three story tall plastic likeness of big ed reynolds ten gallon hat lassoing a tire
jack approaches big eds from the parking lot
slowly taking it all in
its like a pep boys with a texas theme
a big retail store for tires and auto parts and a repair bay for everything from alignments to brake jobs
jack walks to the tire bay where hector s a guatemalan mechanic in grease stained coveralls stands with tommy the salesman
hey jack you happen to know the stock number on those new michelin x s
lemme get back to you on that one
looking at his name tag tommy
to tommy thomas why you bother jack about that
look it up yourself
to jack okay jack we talk later
jack nods amiably then continues into the store
jack walks in
the store is teeming with activity a post holiday sale in progress
big ed in his signature ten gallon hat sees jack from behind the counter
jack my boy
you are looking mighty worse for the wear
hey guess who i played bridge with two nights ago
jack stares blankly at big ed
hell youll never guess
one sydney potter
thats sydney potter chief executive officer of buyrite transport
only the third largest trucking company in the state
i even let the sonuvabitch win which wasnt easy because the guys been bashed in the head by teamsters so many times his brains like porridge
anyhoo hes looking for a new parts supplier
we can handle that kind of volume right
jack considers this briefly
im gonna have to get back to you on that
big ed makes a gun gesture with his forefinger winking at jack then turns back to the activity at the counter as
jack spots kenny a very young sales associate walking by
he reaches out and taps kenny on the shoulder
do i have a private office somewhere in the building
nervously pointing right back there
jack walks into the office with his name on the door
theres no stairmaster here no leather sofa or bar
its small cramped and cluttered the walls littered with tire inventory and price lists
jack takes a slow sad lap around the office
he makes it to the small wooden desk at the far end of the room and sits down behind it
on the desk are photos of jack kate and the kids a plastic michelin man model a tire themed day calendar and a small plastic figurine of a bowler the
word bowlers do it in an alley embossed on its base
he surveys the desktop briefly then opens the top drawer finding a personal checkbook and looking inside
he sees the bottom line and winces then puts it back
jack picks up the bowlers do it in an alley figurine and gives it a good look
bowlers do it in an alley
non profit lawyers do it for free
what is it with these people
dont they realize this refers to sex
he replaces the figurine then opens the bottom drawer where he spots a bottle of glenfiddich
he lifts it out
at least you splurged on some decent scotch
he takes a paper cup and pours himself a shot
he drinks it down in one gulp and then crumples up the cup throwing it toward the nets basketball hoop garbage can near the door
he looks more closely at the photographs
most are family photos a happy jack with kate with annie at the pony rides at joshs birth
in every one of them jack is smiling
to jack in the photo what are you smiling about
he turns his head
spots a small plaque on the wall behind him
it reads jack campbell e
hutton junior sales associate
jack raises an eyebrow
he grabs it off the wall and looks at it more carefully
i was in london in
jacks jarred into reality
to jack in the photo you never went to london
picking up the photo you never got on that plane
he stays there a moment
system comes to life
jack to mag wheels
jack youre needed in mag wheels customer waiting
kenny leading jack toward the mag wheels section
i was the number one junior sales associate at e

no i didnt
thats the kind of thing you can really build on
i mean sales has always been a feeder for m and a always
they approach mag wheels where tommy a slick sales associate stands with a customer looking at the displays
here we are mag wheels
a little concerned hey jack are you sure youre okay
well im just a little confused right now about why i work here
kenny looks at him nervously
i just started here last tuesday
jack nods compassionately
kenny takes off leaving jack alone with his thoughts as tommy approaches with the customer
to the customer so youre all set on the skip shift eliminator and the brembo rotors
jacks our point man on alloy wheels
turning to tommy do you know why do i work here

proudly to the customer jack taught me everything i know about the business
the customer nods impressed

another nod to the customer
and hes a crack up
everything i taught you
i want to hear it all right now
hey im ready to buy here
to the customer what do you want

jack grabs one of the alloy rims off the shelf holding it out to the customer
these are great
youll need four
the customer takes the wheel from jack looks at it confused
but i dont like these
hey you heard the guy im the best damn tire guy in the state of new jersey
turning to tommy everything
hesitating rule number one the customer is always right
a satisfied smirk from the customer
jack is behind his desk his tie loosened on the phone
into phone i have no idea what our inventory level is thats why im asking you
a knock at the door

and keep doing that until further notice
he hangs up the phone as the door opens
big ed sticks his head in
got a minute jack
ive got all the time in the world
big ed walks in followed by sydney potter s a tough looking man
jack meet sydney potter buyrite transport one of jerseys top businessmen
potter extends a hand jack rises from his chair trying to place the name
and a helluva bridge player
eds told me a lot about you
they shake hands
potter nods his head at jack immediately impressed
big ed is beaming
in a heavy jersey accent lucky in cards lucky in business lucky in love
my cup runneth over
to big ed hes a nice looking boy
my daughters no slouch either
a smile from potter then a serious look
lets cut to the chase jack
big ed tells me youre the grease that makes the wheels turn around here
i need a new parts supplier for my fleet
you seem to have the parts
that we know
what we dont know is why the hell i should buy them from you
potter stares jack down
but jacks not about to be intimidated by him
he pauses matching potters stare
i have no idea
a surprised look from potter
an anxious laugh from big ed
nervous cmon jack
to potter i mean it
from what i can tell were a mom and pop operation were already over extended in sales and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a
jack continues to stare down potter
so like i said i dont have any idea why you should buy your parts from us
the staring match continues
big eds getting more nervous
potters the first to blink
okay you got my attention
except for rule number one
the customer is always right
the difference is we mean it
were small we need our customers
we cant afford to disappoint them ever
yeah you could go to some leviathan supplier probably save a few pennies on the price of oil filters but with us you get more than a supplier you get
a bridge partner
a smile from potter
jack gives ed a wink
ed watches thrilled
you want to bid hearts were right there with you
you feel the need to redouble youre not going to get any argument from us
potter nods at jack
jack moves in for the kill
the big guys may have the high cards but you know as well as i do sydney high cards dont always take the trick
potter pauses a minute then
to big ed re jack i like him
big ed smiles letting out a relieved sigh
a wink to jack thats my boy
an arm around potter cmon lemme show you the rest of the ranch
big ed and potter exit the office
turning back to jack nice shootin jack
leaving jack there with a satisfied smile on his face
jack is in bed watching cnbc
on the tv a young woman reporter at the anchors desk
advancers led decliners by a nine to four ratio and the closing tick was a mildly bullish plus seventy six
much of the markets action today was fueled by the latest round of merger mania to hit wall street
the global health systems and medtech logos appear on a graphic in the corner of the screen
when global health systems and medtech pharmaceutical announced their intentions to join forces in a massive one hundred and twenty two billion dollar stock swap deal
though neither side expressed significant regulatory concerns at the announcement press conference it is believed that both the fda and the ftc will be closely scrutinizing the marriage the largest
ever in the health care industry
when asked about possible anti competitive implications global chairman bob thomas referred reporters to p
lassiter and company president alan mintz the original architect behind the deal
jack stares in shock as the image changes to a super confident looking mintz shaking bob thomas hand at the press conference
ironically mintz first met thomas at a lamaze class
a lamaze class
while coaching their pregnant wives mintz and t homas struck up a dialogue about the need for consolidation in the rapidly growing health care industry and two months later the
deal with medtech was born
thats my deal
in other business news u
labor department officials announced today that two hundred and seventy five thousand new jobs were created last month twenty five thousand less than economists were predicting leading to a mild
rally in the bond markets before midday
but as the trading session drew to a close the profit takers stepped in and the long bond closed at ninety seven even up only two ticks the yield inching
down to six point zero seven percent
kate comes into the room from the hallway wearing only jacks nyu sweatshirt
the kids are asleep
she goes over to the window and draws the blinds
jack looks up at her nods then goes back to the tv
i said the kids are asleep
distracted well thats just great
those little monkeys can be a real handful
kate shuts off the tv
i was watching that
i thought we had a deal about you watching cnbc in bed
im working on a new deal now
kate throws a kate bushs the sensual world into the cd player
fine but not tonight
she climbs onto the bed a seductive look on her face
wait a second
you want me dont you
that is the general idea yes
kate starts kissing him
but jacks a little uncomfortable with the sudden intimacy
he pulls back a little nervous
shouldnt we grab some dinner first
maybe a bottle of wine
its ten thirty jack
by eleven youre gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off
we dont have time for wining and dining
whatever you say
she starts kissing him again
but this time he just goes with it and as her hands run through his hair hes brought back to a different time and place
jack momentarily pulls back and looks at her
its like the first time hes really looked at her in eleven years
she smiles at him almost uncomfortable with the compliment
no im serious
youre really stunning
this is good stuff jack keep it coming
i mean back in college you were a very pretty girl theres no question about that
lost in her youve really grown into a beautiful woman
jack stares at her entranced
kate pulls back reacting to the intensity in his stare
how can you do that
nervous do what
look at me like you havent seen me every day for the last twelve years
theres love in her eyes but its not meant for him
she kisses him
she gets up off the bed and heads for the bathroom
he looks around
not sure what to do
he turns onto his side and closes his eyes
kate emerges from the bathroom she sees jack on the bed hears his breathing heavy with sleep
at once charmed and disappointed kate sighs
she turns off the cd player and heads into bed
she pulls the covers up over jack shutting off the light
she puts an arm around him kissing him sweetly on the neck
close in on jacks face
turned away from kate
he opens his eyes
looks down at her arm
loneliness on his face
its mid january and all signs of the christmas season are gone except for the snow on the ground in the busy parking lot
kate pushing josh in the stroller and holding annies hand passing through the mens dept
jack lagging behind a bevy of shopping bags in hand and a beleaguered look on his face
back to jack were almost done here
mary janes mom
okay lets make a quick stop at the kids shoe department pick up my watch from the battery place then ill run into the linen store
an unhappy look on jacks face
why dont we just go to all the stores
kate looks back at jack
every single store in this godforsaken shopping mall
we can go to them all
kate gives him a look
you know what jack
ill go with the kids
why dont you just hang out here in the mens department
jack glances at the mens dept
sighs and gives kate a nod
she takes off with the kids
and then he sees it
the zegna section
hes drawn to the neat rows of beautiful suits like a moth to the light
he approaches the rack pulls out a dark green suit gently touching the soft wool
its perfect for your frame
jack turns and sees a salesman standing behind him
would you like to try it on
jack at a mirror wearing the zegna suit
it is perfect for his frame
the color is spectacular the line is dazzling
jack looks in the mirror shutting everything else out
its like hes seeing his old self
you look amazing in that suit
jack snaps out of his trance
he sees kate standing behind him annie and josh happily playing a few feet away
off the charts great
its an unbelievable thing
wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person
taking one final look im gonna buy it
kate raises an eyebrow then looks at the price tag
are you out of your mind
pointing to annies new mary janes she got those shoes
those shoes were twenty five dollars
cmon take it off
well go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like
jack looks at her
its a moment of decision
kate looks at jack a little surprised
do you have any idea what my life is like
i wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva
i drop the kids off spend eight hours selling tires retail
kate just stands here aghast
i pick up the kids walk the dog which by the way carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap
i play with the kids take out the garbage get six hours of sleep if im lucky and then it starts all over again
and why is it that i always have to drive everyone everywhere
i spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini van listening to raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work
im sick of it
whats in it for me
where are my mary janes
kate stares at him shaking her head
its sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you jack
i cant believe its not a disappointment to you
letting it all out jesus kate i couldve been a thousand times the man i became
how could you do this to me
how could you let me give up on my dreams like this
kate stares at him in disbelief
who are you
kates words pierce jack
he has to avert his eyes
lowering his voice look im sorry
im sorry i was such a saint before and im such a prick now
maybe im just not the same guy i was when we got married
maybe youre not
the jack campbell i married wouldnt need a suit to make himself feel better about his life but if thats what its gonna take then buy it
just buy the goddamn suit
we can take the money out of the kids college fund
they stare at each other for a moment
a stand off
taking off the jacket well get a funnel cake
itll be the highlight of my week
the blue mini van makes its way down this road
theres an icy silence in the car
jack is behind the wheel kate next to him looking out the window anger on her face
jack checks the rear view mirror sees annie and josh in the back both asleep
to kate listen im sorry about that back in the store
i really dont want to fight with you
kate just keeps looking out the window
but you must sometimes wonder how we ended up here
i mean back in college did you see us
looking around here
she turns to him
ill give you this life has thrown us a few surprises
a glimmer in jacks eye
it really has hasnt it
so if you had to
what would you say was the biggest surprise
she glances at the kids sleeping in the back
annie for one

a nostalgic smile remember that little place on charles street we used to go to
in the village
when we were living in greenwich village

you cant really raise a kid in an apartment in the village
jack nods starting to piece it together
the trek out to the hospital every day didnt help either
looking at him you were great
surviving the heart attack was one thing

a laugh jack stop that
im still mad at you
a sigh who knows what wouldve happened if you hadnt stepped in at the store
thats why i work for big ed
a look from kate

jack looks out at the road a moment piecing it all together in his mind
almost to himself so we had a baby big ed had a heart attack we b ought that house and ive been working for him ever since
sayonara wall street
kate looks at him a little strangely
turning to her our life in a nutshell
if you want to look at it that way
how would you look at it
she glances again at the kids in the back seat then at jack
a great success story
a smile from jack
he admires her outlook even if he cant bring himself to share it
a crowded suburban new jersey bowling alley
jack stands at a lane holding a bowling ball the nickname the hammer emblazoned over his bowling shirt pocket
he approaches the line and throws the ball down the lane
the ball caroms off the hardwood into the gutter
from behind jesus jack this is a league match for gods sake
arnie and the bowling team are in the scorekeeping area watching jack make a mockery of the sport
wheres your follow through
wheres your stance
hey im doing the best i can
under his breath id like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers
why am i so competitive
compensation i guess
look just focus jack
you can still pick up the spare
jack retrieves his ball sets up genuinely concentrating
quietly to himself you are jack campbell
youre better than this sport
you shot the rapids at kenai
you ran with the bulls at pamplona
you jumped out of a plane over the mojave desert for christs sake
you can do this
jack puts everything he has into the throw heaving the ball down the lane with as much grace and power as he can muster
hitting the six pin and taking out four others
screaming excited yeah
he turns a fist pumped
but the guys could care less
to teammate okay pete youre up
jack walks out of the mens room heading toward the lounge
he sees a familiar face walking toward him
a woman in a sexy little bowling outfit carrying a bowling ball to a far lane
a moment of confusion as he tries to place the face
i saw you out there on lane five
what do you have the flu or something
something like that
with a wink need a nurse
youre a nurse
if thats what you want
she brushes past jack continuing to her lane
jack follows her with his eyes a moment then
wait a second
are we what jack
is there something going on between us
evelyns surprised at jacks directness
she stands there a beat then walks back toward him
are we finally being honest
it would help me if we were
okay youre right weve been dancing around this for years
evelyn looks a little flush
she briefly fans her face
god my heart is racing
a smile when i get dressed for a party and i know youre going to be there
well lets just say i dont go strapless because my husband likes it
an intrigued smile from jack
ive got six sets of snow tires piled up in my garage and i wont even drive in the snow
and our kids just happen to be in the same ballet class every year
she picks a piece of lint off his shirt
so if youre asking me whether id like it to be more the answer is yes
a look of surprise from jack
and kate would never have to know
jack considers this for a moment
do i have your number
a wide smile from evelyn
steves out of town with the kids this week
why dont you just stop by
she turns leaving jack standing there watching her sashay back to her lane
jack walks into the lounge a little dazed
he heads over to arnie whos having a beer at the bar
looking at jack hey jack youre all flush
i guess that seventy one took a lot outta you
sitting down i just saw evelyn thompson
she is relentless
she wants to have an affair with me
she said that
shaking his head what is it about you
pushing over a napkin so could you write down her exact address
wait a second jack
youre not actually gonna cheat on kate
it wouldnt really be cheating
off arnies doubtful look its complicated
look maybe im not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one
a little flirtations harmless but youre playing with fire here
the fidelity bank and trust is a tough creditor
you make a deposit somewhere else they close your account forever
im telling you those rules dont apply to me arn
a chuckle screw the rules
im talking about the choice
jack looks at him curiously
cmon evelyn thompsons got no class
she doesnt marry dr
steve the womans living in a trailer
hey is that really necessary
all im saying it there isnt a guy in union county who wouldnt give his left nut to be married to kate
arnie takes one last swig of his beer and gets up
ill see ya later jack
he leaves jack alone thinking
jack walks into the house carrying his bowling bag
he dumps the bag in the coat closet and walks into the kitchen where
kate is at the counter her back to him poring over some legal documents
not looking up how was the game honey
opening the fridge long boring and generally pretty sad
arnie seemed to enjoy it
peering inside hey wheres that chocolate cake
kate turns around revealing a huge hunk of chocolate cake on a plate in front of her a bite ready to go into her mouth
with a smile you mean this chocolate cake
thats my piece
i was saving it because i got nauseated from that store bought chicken
kate takes the bite a little piece of icing sticks to the side of her mouth
jack approaches the counter
gimme that cake
she takes another bite
he makes a grab for the plate but she holds it out where he cant reach it
its too important to me
they stare each other down a moment
he tries to swipe the plate
kate jumps out of her chair running out of the kitchen with the cake laughing
jack takes off after her
chasing her through the house
just about the catch up to her when
she darts up the stairs still laughing
he follows her
i want that cake
grabs her shirt
pulls her down playfully on top of him
laughing you want the cake
out of breath i want it
she looks at him then takes the whole piece in her hand and smooshes it right in his mouth
then jack starts laughing
its good right
he takes a big clump of it and smooshes it in her mouth
they stay there a moment lying on the stairs feeding each other cake laughing
jack leans back on the stairs
he looks at kates face practically covered in cake smiling and realizes
he hasnt laughed like this in thirteen years
are the kids asleep
a sexy smile from kate
they start kissing passionately right there on the steps
its heating up
caught up in the moment say it jack
cmon you know what i like to hear
in the throes of passion yeah baby i know what you like to hear
kissing him then say it
just say it to me
swept up in the moment oh yeah youre a bad girl baby
you make me so hot
im gonna take you to that special place
kate pulls away
jack looks up at her he can practically see the passion drain from her face
youre sweeping me off my feet
you make me hot
she gets up and heads up the steps disappearing into the bedroom
jack shakes his head frustrated
then he feels something licking at his hand
he looks down and sees lucy standing next to him wagging her tail looking up at jack with an ive gotta go look on her face
jack heaves a sigh then
cmon lucy maybe one of us can get a little relief tonight
he leads the dog toward the front door
jack is walking lucy
he passes a house that looks familiar to him
then he sees it
the name thompson etched on the mailbox
its the thompson house now sans the garish christmas decorations a drying christmas tree tied up on the curb ready to be picked up as garbage
jack stops pulling the dog back looking up at the house
he sees a light on in the upstairs bedroom
the faint outline of a woman reading by the window
jack looks around sees the street is empty then nudges the dog leading her up the path to the house
he gets to the front door
moves his hand up to the doorbell
but its a tentative move
he keeps it there a moment perched at the button
but for some reason he cant bring himself to push it
he looks down the street toward his own house then to the window upstairs
finally he turns
pulling the leash cmon girl lets go home
the front door opens and jack walks in with lucy on a leash his face red from the cold outside
he gives the dog a pat on the rump then takes off his coat hanging it and the leash on a hook by the door
he walks through the quiet house into the living room rubbing his hands together to warm them up
he goes over to a glass bar stand and pours himself a scotch taking a sip letting the alcohol warm him
he strolls through the room looking at some of the family photos framed and hanging on the wall focusing on his own face in the pictures studying the expressions
he moves to a pile of video tapes sitting on a shelf marked with titles like trip to yosemite and joshs st birthday
he runs his fingers along the tapes stopping at one marked jack singing
his eyes linger there a moment
he puts his drink down and pops the tape in the vcr
its a party for kates birthday thrown at the kramers house
same crowd of people as the christmas party cheesy happy birthday decorations
the image jerks up and down surveying the crowd
bill kramer at the piano playing some light cocktail music
kate talking with a group of friends
jesus bill this thing is an antique
dont you even have image stabilization
bill stops playing and looks up at arnie
four hundred bucks at best buy arn
jack comes into frame a confident smile on his face
and everyone knows image stabilization is for the weak
jack is jarred by the image of himself on the video
jack on tv
he smiles as kate walks into frame easily putting an arm around jack
so jack its your wifes birthday got anything to say to her
to kate its your birthday
whats your name
where were you born
wait a minute
youre my wife
she slaps him playfully on the arm
i do have one thing i wanna say
kate looks at him expectantly
singing to her oh those fingers in my hair that sly come hither stare strips my conscience bare its witchcraft
jack doesnt have the greatest voice in the world but hes not the least bit self conscious
and kate seems to like it theres a twinkle in her eye
some of the guests focus their attention on jack and kate
jack winces embarrassed as he watches himself sing
and ive got no defense for it that heat is too intense for it what good would common sense for it do
bill kramer still at the piano chimes in with the basic chords for witchcract sounding it out as he goes along
cause its witchcraft wicked witchcraft
and although i know its strictly taboo
when you rouse the need in me my heart says yes indeed in me proceed with what youre leadin me to
the camera catches the reactions of guests in the crowd
the women smiles on their faces wrapped up in the romance of the moment
envy on the mens faces as they watch jack serenade his wife
a musical interlude from bill as jack takes off his jacket
some hoots and hollers from the crowd
arnie captures the image of kate whistling at her husband
arnie follows with the camera as jack strolls in front of the gathered guests
its such an ancient pitch but one that id never switch there aint no nicer witch than you
jack watches himself move gracefully
but its no longer embarrassment on his face its fascination
back in the video the camera catches evelyn thompson watching longingly as jack moves back toward kate
evelyn cant take it anymore she abruptly turns and walks toward the kitchen
jack raises an eyebrow
in the video
jack approaches kate she couldnt have a more delighted look on her face
he picks up the verse
cause its witchcraft that koo koo witchcraft
and although i know its strictly taboo
the camera pans across the crowd even the men are getting into it focused on jack as he sings lovingly unashamed to his wife
nick careli mouths the words along with jack almost as if hes studying him revering him
jack watches the tv seeing nick do this
maybe he underestimated his alter ego
on the video
jack staring into kates eyes
when you rouse the need in me my heart says yes indeed to me proceed with what youre leadin me to
jack and kate exchange a sexy smile
its such an ancient pitch but one that id never switch
jack kisses her on the lips
hoots and hollers from the crowd
cause theres no nicer witch than you
kate brushes a hand across jacks face
smash cut to jack watching this
seeing the connection the heat between them
back to the video
the music building
the crowd completely in the palm of jacks hand
the camera closes in on jack and kate as the music builds to a crescendo
a little musical flourish from bill as the crowd breaks out into huge cheers and applause
jack watching this other version of himself in the video the center of attention larger than life focused on kate
back on video
speaking quietly to kate happy birthday sweetheart
i love you
kate leans over giving jack a deep kiss
oohs and ahhs from the crowd
but jack and kate are in their own little world
jack continues to watch himself on the video his smile fading becoming a look of realization
a tear at the corner of his eye
the sound fades in jacks head as the action in the video continues
hes left standing there
lucy licking jacks face
jack pushes the dog away
the alarm rings
kate pushes the button to stop it
groggy time to get up honey
jack obliges without question getting out of bed putting on a robe and slippers and exiting still practically half asleep
jack walks into the kitchen
he turns on the mr
coffee gets a bottle from the fridge throws it in the microwave removes it and heads upstairs
into joshs room
josh is wide awake standing up in his crib like a prisoner in a cell
jack gives him the bottle pats his head perfunctorily and then walks out of the room
and back into the bedroom to find kate sitting on the bed a wrapped present in front of her and a wide smile on her face
jack stops raising an eyebrow at the gift
he looks behind as if to ask whether its for him then back to kate
happy anniversary honey
terror on jacks face
pushing the gift forward before you do whatever crazy stunt youve got planned i want you to open mine
jack musters up a smile then approaches the gift
maybe i should wait
no open it
he hesitates then begins unwrapping the package revealing
a suit similar in color and style to the zegna suit
i found it at an outlet store
i know its a knock off but i think itll look great on you
examining the label zeena
jack is overcome with emotion
yes its a zeena but this is probably the nicest thing anyones ever done for him
tearing up you really are incredible
enjoy it sweetheart
jack looks at kates expectant face suddenly remembering how truly screwed he is
youre probably expecting something from me
hes sweating bullets
watching as kate gets a quizzical look on her face
heres the thing
i really hadnt planned on giving you your
anniversary gift until tonight
an uncomfortable smile you know anniversarys good all day
what are you talking about
you never wait all day
you can barely wait until its light out
i know that but
kate looks at him like shes looking into his soul
jack stands there silent
you actually forgot our anniversary
ill fix it
ill go out right now and get you something
ill make it right
that didnt help
holding back the tears jesus jack
is this where we are now
is this our marriage
suddenly im the wife who has to drop hints two weeks before her anniversary so her husband doesnt fuck it up
jack sees a tear run down her face
a pang of guilt on his
please dont cry
kate wipes the tear away but they just keep coming
shaking her head crying i dont want to be that jack
jack approaches her holding out a hand but kate pushes it away gets up and walks toward the bathroom
jack is left standing alone holding kates gift
jack emerges from the house steps out onto the porch for some air
he shakes his head a mixture of frustration and self pity on his face
he notices annies bike leaning against the side of the porch and the bell that cash gave him sitting on its handle bar
he takes a step toward it and gives the bell a gentle ring
he looks around as if hes expecting someone to appear
but theres no one
he rings the bell again louder this time really trying to attract someones attention
finally he lifts the bike up in the air ringing the bell with everything hes got
shouting to the sky cmon goddamnit how was i supposed to know the date of their anniversary
i never married her
annie in the doorway
looking at him
slowly put the bicycle back on the ground
jack turns and sees her gently lowering the bicycle
jack is mixing a glass of chocolate milk
annie arms folded is waiting expectantly
he finishes sliding the glass to her
she takes a long sip puts the glass down a chocolate milk mustache on her lip
i shoulda warned you
dad always does something really special for their anniversary
one year he had a solar system named after her
dont you think thats a little gimmicky
mom liked it
jack raises an eyebrow
maybe theres a jewelry store back at the mall
i could get her a pair of earrings or something
thats good but
you did forget the anniversary
thats a major oversight
thinking aloud so if im kate
i cant really afford the finer things my husbands career is a crushing disappointment to me im trapped in suburbia
did he ever take her to the city
annie smiles impressed
youre really gettin the hang of this
suddenly a look of confidence comes over jacks face
for the first time he seems like a man in control
annie is sitting on the bed watching her mother get dressed
kate wearing a silky slip walks out of her closet carrying two dresses on hangers a red one and a sexy little black one
kate holds out the two dresses to annie
which do you think
annie thinks about it for a moment taking it very seriously
the black one
shes about to put it on when she looks at annie
fightings a part of it annie
you know that right
im not worried mom
hes still learning our ways
kate looks at her with a raised eyebrow then nods
she puts down the dress and holds out a hand to annie
kate leads her to the makeup table then opens a lipstick
kate nods then applies some red lipstick to annies lips
now go like this
kate rubs her lips together showing annie how to do it
annie mimics her mom then kate looks at her annies beaming
youre gonna break a lot of hearts you know
a smile from annie
pull back to reveal
jack standing at the door watching
appreciating the kind of mother kate is
a small elegant french restaurant hidden on a tree lined lower manhattan street
jack is wearing the suit kate gave him
its not a zegna but he looks pretty damn good
he leads kate toward the cloak room at this intimate restaurant
he helps her off with her coat
kates wearing the sexy little black dress and we can immediately see its effectiveness
you look beautiful
a charmed smile from kate as she hands jack her coat
jack hands the coats over to the coat check girl
instinctively thanks catherine
jack fakes a sneeze trying to cover up
kate gives him a pat on the back
he takes kate by the arm
he leads her to the main room
she looks out at the room elegant tables french country decor a pianist playing cole porter
quietly to jack jack
can we afford all this
whats the difference
im taking my baby out for our anniversary damn the costs
how do you even know about this place
jacks caught for a moment
hell throw you a curve ball once in a while thats for sure
jack puts his arm around her and kisses her on the cheek
jack and kate sit at a secluded table a waiter standing next to them
jacks not even looking at the menu
well have the tureen of quail breast with shiitake mushrooms to start then the veal medallions in raspberry truffle sauce and the sea scallops with pureed artichoke hearts
sea scallops north of the caspian
kate looks at jack a mixture of confusion and awe on her face
very good sir
and may i say those are all excellent selections
perusing the wine list also well have a bottle of lafite
kate reaches over and pulls down the wine list reading it upside down
its five hundred and fifty dollars jack
a wince from jack
for a moment there it was almost perfect
just a glass of red wine for each of us
the waiter nods then walks toward the kitchen
you are so not off the hook yet slick
but im gettin close right
a noncommittal nod from kate
then jack notices her look over at the pianist drawn in by the music
you want to dance
a puzzled look from kate
theres nobody else dancing
there isnt even much room to dance
i dont think theres dancing here jack
jack gets up and holds out a hand
sure there is
kate looks around again then she smiles
kate rises taking his hand
jack takes her in his arms swaying slowly in the limited amount of space confident and self assured
the pianist looks up smiling appreciating their role in this romantic moment
kate moves with jack following his lead comfortably
they look good together
in sync with each other
people are watching them
some of the men are impressed others are scoffing but the women are clearly charmed
whispering to jack pretty good for a tire salesman from jersey
jack flashes her his most charming smile
i have my moments
they continue to dance in a world of their own
jack and kate at the table enjoying a gourmet meal
jack holds out a fork with a piece of veal for kate
she takes a bite
spearing a scallop here try one of these
jack takes a scallop from kates fork
savoring the scallop god i missed that taste
why are you laughing
kate shoots him a look of curiosity
jack looks back at her sees the trust in her face
he puts down his fork
i need to tell you something
i think it may help us but theres a slight chance it could make things worse
she hears the seriousness in his voice
now im worried
just say it
whatever it is well deal with it
are you sure
jack searches his mind for the right words
i feel like im living someone elses life
jack looks to her expecting the worst
but she just nods reassuringly
i used to be so sure about everything you know
i knew exactly who i was and what i wanted
then one morning i woke up and suddenly it was all different
worse you mean
well maybe a few things
but mostly just different
jack lets out a small smile
now hes the one whos reassuring kate
i never used to be like this kate
i had it all figured out
no doubts no regrets
he looks at her staring into her eyes almost desperate for understanding
a raised eyebrow from jack
i think its good to be a little unsure about who you are
its very human
but you always seem so certain
cmon jack you think there arent mornings when i wake up and wonder what the hell im doing in new jersey
thats a big one for me too
my office is a dump i answer my own phone
and youve seen my pay check
your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks
i mean yes i help people that need it
some of them are probably faking
a laugh then
god sometimes i think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a cd player
he smiles right there with her
imagine having a life where everything was easy
where you asked for things and people just brought them to you
kate laughs nodding
a pause then
i think about it too jack
i think about the kind of person id be if i hadnt married you
its as if shes inside his head
they stay like this for a moment looking into each other
she stops a moment considering
and i realize ive just erased the things in my life im most sure about
you the kids
what are you sure about
jack looks into kates eyes
im sure that right now theres nowhere id rather be than here with you
kate smiles at jack a loving secure smile
its been a while
the mini van parked outside a small brownstone right on the square
its like something out of a henry james novel
charming meticulously maintained elegant
the door opens and jack carrying kate in his arms enters
jack puts kate down and she takes in the room antique furniture
its like walking into another world
this is so beautiful
jack smiles as he opens a champagne bottle sitting on a silver ice bucket
you know champagne makes me do crazy things
pouring ill just full yours up to the top
handing her a glass happy anniversary sweetheart
kate smiles clinking her glass with jacks
i dont know how you did it hoss but you pulled it off
im out of the doghouse
kate saunters into the bedroom looking at the king size poster bed feeling the down quilt
jack follows her
turning to him you may even get lucky tonight
kate kisses him
when their lips separate we can see the powerful effect it has on him
jack looks deep into her eyes stroking her hair lost in her
i already told you you were gonna get lucky jack
they kiss again a long soulful kiss
jack pulls back a look of realization on his face
my god all this time
i never stopped loving you
a wide smile thats all i wanted to hear
she kisses him their bodies intertwined
more and more passionate
then reaches behind her to the light
the room goes dark
morning sun streams onto jack and kate in bed
kate in jacks arms her head on his chest a contented smile on her face
jacks eyes open
adjust to the light
he looks over at kate
theres something different in his eyes
a broad im in love kind of smile
kate stirs gently stroking jacks chest
kate lifts her head turning to face jack
i feel like i should give you money
i mean my god jack you were always good but this
like a porno movie
kate lays her head back on jacks chest looking at washington square through the window
i could stay here forever
i dont think id fight you on that one
kate lifts her head and looks at him expectantly
the mini van passes a sign that reads welcome to teaneck
annie walking through the downstairs of the house practicing her violin
its a noise bordering on music but not quite
she walks into the kitchen where
jack stands at the counter in his robe reading the newark star ledger and drinking a cup of coffee
he lowers the paper watches annie with a smile as she strolls through the room playing her violin badly
he goes back to his paper
jack still singing donning his dockers and short sleeve oxford
the front door of the campbell house
jack emerges in his work clothes putting his coat on a bagel in his mouth
he disappears from frame the screen door closing slowly behind him
in a moment
kate appears at the door a cup of coffee in her hand
she follows jack with her eyes as he heads to the car
a smile from kate
in a moment
jack returns to frame and heads straight into kates arms
a passionate kiss as she leans against the door post
have a good day
a smile from jack as she pats him on the ass and sends him on his way
jack pointing to a stack of radials is standing with a man s wearing a pale blue leisure suit and a pair of high top nike air jordans
for the money theyre hands down the best radial we carry
okay ill take them
you wont regret it
shouting to tommy tommy
conlin up with four b
goodrich g force t as
looking the man over and give him ten percent off for having the best costume
just then a black rolls royce silver seraph pulls into the lot its front left tire riding on the rim
system jack kate on line two
jack pick up two
jack turns toward the door but then looks curiously back at the rolls
something familiar about it
peter lassiter gets out of the car
walking out to jack kates on two jack
on seeing the rolls nice ride
staring at lassiter if youre into that kind of conspicuous consumption
you want me to handle him
i think im ready
kate still holding on line two
be careful he looks like a tough negotiator
jack walks inside
but hes still focused on lassiter through the window cant take his eyes off him
he gets to the phone
sees the light for line two blinking
he looks back outside sees kenny approach lassiter
back to the blinking phone light
he picks up the phone
but cant bring himself to hit the blinking light
to estelle into intercom tell kate ill call her back
into intercom it sounded pretty important
into intercom im with a customer
ill call her back
he takes his hand away from the phone and walks back outside the store
towards kenny and lassiter
to kenny i seem to have had some kind of blow out
jack approaches tapping kenny on the shoulder
why dont you let me take this one kenny
kenny nods then heads back inside
surprised do i know you
ive seen you on cnbc
with a smile you look taller in real life
jack leaning back in his chair behind the desk of his cluttered cramped office
truth is mintz was so busy timing his wifes breathing he didnt see that medtech needed global more than the other way around
ten days two weeks tops they wouldve approached you with an offer and id bet anything it wouldve been thirty billion not twenty nine
a knowing smile problem was peter you had a pussycat running the show
what you needed was a rottweiler
lassiter sitting on the little chair across from jack an intrigued look on his face
nodding well im impressed
a smile from jack
i really am
jack savors the moment until
so about my car
hes jarred back to reality a little crestfallen
were going to have to special order that tire
itll be ready in about two days
lassiter nods then takes a business card out of his wallet
this has my office address on it
why dont you drop it off yourself
a smile from jack
kate sound asleep in bed
pan across to jack his eyes wide open lost in thought
jack wearing his zeena suit sitting behind his desk distracted as he listens to hector s the i say to her margarita we already have four kids why do we
jack is shaking his leg anxiously under the desk as he eyes the door
but she say she want an even number
i say four is an even number
but she say she want six
jack checks his watch
i tell her margarita i just got my green card i like to sit back and rest a little bit
do i usually listen to your personal problems
sure jack all the time
jack nods then
look i have some business that i have to take care of in the city so im leaving early
getting up my advice to you
follow your dreams
jack pulling up to the building in lassiters rolls
he gets out of the car walks to the building feeling good confident stopping to gaze up at the skyscraper
he breathes in deeply then heads inside
jack enters instinctively tossing the car keys to the security guard
the guard looks at him like hes crazy
jack and lassiter walk together
were really more of a boutique operation as you can see
but youre not interested in boutique dollars
a smile i get it
they walk into
past the assistants desk
seeing lassiter hes expecting you mr
lassiter doesnt even slow down
its jacks old office but you wouldnt know it from the decor
lots of country pine a fabric sofa and a play pen where the bar used to be
jack enters immediately struck by the difference
to mintz alan this is jack campbell
the one i was telling you about
mintz a confident look on his face gets up from the desk and goes to shake jacks hand
jack of course
they shake hands
appropriately deferential mr
please call me alan
we try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here
re play pen i can see that alan
a chuckle from mintz
you have kids jack
another laugh from mintz
gesturing to the sofa why dont you have a seat
jack nods sits down on the plush sofa mintz and lassiter take the chairs
so peter mentioned that you were an avid cnbc watcher but didnt say whether you had any actual wall street experience
jacks a little taken aback by the question not realizing he was walking into an interview
he crosses his legs trying to get comfortable
i was a sales associate at e
and now youre in the tire business
and auto supply
the retail end i understand
we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service
mind if i ask what kind of sales you did last year
we did one point seven million in total revenue
one point seven
and what do you project for this year
jack pauses analyzing the situation
the patronizing questions the smirk on mintzs face
any thoughts at all on that
as jack stares into their faces he realizes the extent of his handicap
he stops takes a moment looking at mintz and lassiter then
a confident smile
well alan i think were gonna have a banner year
sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account
so youre projecting what a tad over two million
a gleam in jacks eye
and that would make us number one in our market
getting up you mind if i stand
a raised eyebrow from mintz
mintz and lassiter follow jack with their eyes as he crosses the room to the desk pours himself a glass of water
look i know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year
and i know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger
im not trying to knock the tire business jack
a confident chuckle its okay alan
i get it
im in your shoes im thinking exactly the same thing
but heres the thing
business is business
wall street main street its all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning trying to figure out how the hell theyre gonna send their kids to college
its just people
jacks confidence is throwing mintz off but lassiter appears intrigued
and i know people
im sure you do
intervening lets let the man have his say
mintz covers his embarrassment with a smile
to mintz take you for instance
defensive what about me
you drink about sixteen diet cokes a day
youre an excellent father but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home
you drink bourbon but you offer your clients scotch
jack looks around the office then back to mintz
and your wife decorated this office
a laugh from lassiter as mintz sits there stewing a caught look on his face
he certainly has your number alan
turning to lassiter youre a little tougher peter
a raised eyebrow from lassiter but hes game
for one thing you like expensive things
smiling proudly thats easy
youve seen my car
a chuckle okay
you smoke hoyo de monterreys
youre a scotch man single malt not because its trendy but because youve been doing it for forty years and you stay with what works
you have two great loves in your life your horses and this company
you wept openly the day the dow hit ten thousand
and youre a man who prides himself on finding talent in unusual places
and how would you know that
because im here
nodding his head
mintz a plastered on smile
im prepared to do anything it takes to get this job
start anywhere you need me to start
ill park cars if i to
into lassiters eyes the biggest part of judging character is knowing yourself
and i know this i can do this job
give me a chance peter i wont let you down
lassiter returns jacks gaze with equal intensity
in a moment he turns to mintz
to mintz alan why dont you show jack around a bit
id love to
jack and alan walking side by side down the hallway
employees passing them by greeting mintz mintz waving back
pointing thats our war room
we did seven major deals last year three of them hostile
not particularly impressed seven
they turn a corner coming into a deserted section of the corridor
mintz stops turning to jack
jack returns mintzs gaze with a quizzical look
lets cut the shit huh campbell
what did you go through his wallet or something
jacks a little taken aback
that circus act back there may have dazzled lassiter momentarily but it doesnt do shit forme
even if you get this job which i highly doubt let me warn you lassiter loses interest in his pet projects very quickly
im in the big office because ive proved myself to him year after year and nobody is going to come in here and start turning the old mans head
especially not some tire salesman from new jersey
so you watch yourself and stay away from lassiter and maybe just maybe ill keep you on after he gets tired of you
do we understand each other
jack stands there staring at mintz silent expressionless
then a broad smile from jack
god you really are different arent you
nodding i mean
i am impressed
now its mintzs turn to look quizzical
good for you
why shouldnt you protect whats yours
i dont think youre hearing me
oh im hearing you alan
thats not the problem
the problem is that what you think is yours is really mine
and i dont care how low on the totem pole i start i will get it back
poking him in the chest so do yourself a favor and dont get too attached to that view because sometime soon maybe very soon you and your french country antiques
your chintz sofa and your little play pen are gonna be moving out of that office
jack smiles at alan one more time then turns
oh and by the way you try selling tires for a living
i promise you youd starve
jack heads down the corridor whistling a happy tune leaving mintz standing there bewildered
a double door opens and jack leads kate into this huge duplex
kate looks around taking the place in
welcome to xanadu
the place is incredible
marble floors architectural lines high tech fixtures elegant modern furniture
its striking but not at all homey like the jersey house
pretty incredible isnt it
its like a museum
turning to jack so whats the big surprise
you didnt rent this place for the weekend did you
for the week
this place is a perk kate
a perk for what
a company called p
lassiter and associates investment house uses it to attract new executives
youre talking to their new vice president of mergers and acquisitions
what are you talking about jack
im going into arbitrage honey
turns out i have a knack for it
ill be making two hundred grand a year plus a hefty bonus and thats just to start
and we can live in this apartment practically rent free for as long as we want
jack measures her reaction
its not good
we can finally afford to move back into the city
kate just looks at him in shock
are you out of your mind
i dont think so
this is going to be a better life for all of us honey
well put annie and josh in private schools
annie goes to a great school
im talking about the best schools in the country here kate
jack what could you possibly be thinking
what about my job
this is new york city its like the needy people capital of the world
those jersey clients of yours arent a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here
cutting him off i cant believe you want to move back into the city
i thought the reason we left was because we didnt want to raise the kids here
no this is the center of the universe
if i were living in roman times i would live in rome where else
today america is the roman empire and new york is rome itself
cutting him off jack
jacks starting to struggle
look im detecting a kind of funky tension here
we dont have to live in this apartment
i dont need this
ill drive to work
jacks back on his heels
seeing his dream picked apart
its over an hour each way
thats almost three hours a day
when are you going to see the kids
he pauses a moment to gather himself
youre not understanding me
im talking about a great life
a perfect life
everything we pictured when we were young
the whole package
you said it yourself life has thrown us surprises and so we made sacrifices
but now i can finally get us back on track
a sad chuckle from kate
i can do that
i want to do that
for all of us
i need to do that as a man
imploring her think about it
no more lousy restaurants no more clipping coupons no more shoveling snow
then get a goddamn snow blower
jacks taken aback by the intensity of her tone
dont get a new career without even telling me
dont take annie out of a school she loves
dont move us out of a house weve become a family in
kate stands there wounded
quietly dont do that
look youre making this into something its not
this isnt a referendum on our lives kate
its a step forward
appealing to her dont you see
im talking about us finally having a life other people envy
kate looks him in the eye a deep piercing look
they already do envy us jack
kate picks up her bag and walks out of the apartment
annie is in a nightgown practicing her violin
jack walks in
its all he can do to hold back cringing at the missed notes
annie finishes the piece lowering the bow
what is it
mary had a little lamb
annie starts playing again as jack looks at the dresser
she has or so family photos lined up and down its sides
jack studies them
in every one jacks face is totally contented
jack studies them looking at his own face
annie lowers the bow watching him
jack turns to her
please dont stop
she smiles then starts playing again
he turns back to the pictures
standing in front of the desk nursing a drink
he looks at lassiters business card sitting on the surface of the desk
he gazes around the room
his eyes coming to rest on a bookshelf
he moves toward it
looking at its spine
its a tattered copy of vonneguts cats cradle
he pulls it off the shelf theres something inside
a pan am ticket jacket sleeve
a boarding pass
from london heathrow to new york jfk
he looks at it
somethings not right
from london to new york
looking up i came back
jack turns and sees kate walking into the doorway standing there
she sees jack holding the pan am ticket sleeve
our finest moment right
a quizzical look from jack
when you got on that plane i was sure it was over
i left the airport afraid id never see you again
and then you showed up the very next day
a wistful smile that was a good surprise
she continues into the room leaning against a bookshelf
i think about you on that plane about what must have been going through your mind
you sitting there imagining our life together our life apart
i think about the decision you made
jack watches her as she lets out a small sigh
maybe i was being naive but i believed wed grow old together in this house
that wed spend holidays here have g randchildren visit us here
i had this image of us all grey and wrinkly me working in the garden you repainting the deck
kate smiles gently as she pictures this
things change right
pausing if you need this jack i mean really need this i will take these children from a life they love and take myself from the only home weve ever
shared and move wherever you need to go
ill do that because i love you
the words are like a warm embrace for jack
i love you jack
and thats more important to me than our address
kate smiles lovingly at jack
she walks over to him kisses him gently on the forehead
i choose us
she turns and heads out of the room leaving him there the boarding pass still in hand staring lovingly at her as she goes
jack walks into the room
the lights are off kate already in bed sleeping
he undresses for bed unable to take his eyes off kate
finally he lifts the covers and climbs into bed next to her moving closer to her putting an arm around her drawing her in
in her sleep kate nestles in jacks embrace
he savors the feeling then closes his eyes as
they lay there
side by side
a single person
the morning light streams into the room
kate opens her eyes
jacks not in bed
a look of curiosity
then she hears laughter from outside
she goes over to the window
opens the blinds
jack in the backyard laughing with joy playing in the snow with annie and josh
a satisfied smile sweeping across her face
jack reaches out and snags annie
she cackles in delight
the three of them fall over onto the soft white snow
the laughter from the kids is uncontrollable jacks joy is just as palpable
finally annie stops laughing and grabs jack around the neck hugging his tight
whispering in jacks ear i knew youd come back
jack walks over to a utility shelf fishing around until he finds a bag of rock salt
he grabs it sees its empty
and then he hears it
the sound of a bicycle bell ringing echoing through the room
a shudder passes through his body
he turns and sees annie at the open garage door sitting on her bike ringing the bell
its an eerie moment for jack
what are you doing
a curious look ringing my bell
on jacks anxious face
crouched down in an aisle of this local convenience store
checking out the bags of rock salt
he looks at the price tag on one of the bags
four ninety nine
its just salt for gods sake
on the entrance to the store
the door opens a young girl enters an average suburban teenager
she glances at a fashion magazine picks up a package of gum
from the pov of the cashier we see the girl approach the counter
on jack crouched down in the aisle
he grabs a bag of salt from the shelf when
thatll be sixty five cents little angel
jack registers the voice
he rises slowly looking over to the front counter
where he sees
cash dressed in a typical chain convenience store uniform ringing up the teenager
an excited smile from jack at the sight of cash
the color drains from jacks face
what are you doing here
jack moves toward cash at the counter
youre not sending me back
the girl eyes jack curiously then removes a dollar bill from her pocket and slides it across the counter to cash
jack its good to see you
cash reaches into the register taking out change for ten dollars
he hands the girl
to the girl thank you darlin
the girl looks at the money realizing that cash has given her the wrong change
back to jack seeing the rock salt what do you got there rock salt
look at you all domestic and shit
you really figured some things out huh
the girl looks at cash talking to jack
im not going back
the girl hesitates
cash turns to her
to the girl everything okay
she looks at him a moment of decision then
raising his voice hey
did you hear me
cash ignores jack watching the girl as she heads to the door hesitates a moment then walks out
a look of disappointment on cashs face as he reaches into his pocket pulling out a little notebook
cash looks at jack
making a note in his book that was a character issue
shaking his head and for nine dollars
thats just sad
hey im talking to you
i am not going back do you understand
cash looks at him compassion on his face
you cant do this
you cant keep coming in and out of peoples lives messing things up
jack throws six bucks on the counter
ive got kids im going home
you know what the word glimpse means j
its by nature an impermanent thing
jack walks determinedly toward the exit
he stops and turns at the door
pointing at cash im staying
cash follows him with his eyes a proud look on cashs face as jack leaves
jack walks to josh
hes sleeping soundly
jack gently kisses josh on the head careful not to wake him
jack is standing over annie kissing her on the cheek
stirring groggy is it morning yet
go back to sleep
she closes her eyes as jack stands there for a moment looking at her sadness all over his face
take care of yourself annie
im going back to the mother ship
finally he turns to go
the clock reads
kate is already in bed as jack walks in
looking up from her book hey
jack approaches her sitting on the bed
these last weeks kate i know that ive done some
some unusual things
its been interesting thats for sure
but ive done some good things too havent i
youve been jack campbell
and thats always a good thing
she kisses him on the cheek
he takes her arms in his hands and looks her in the eyes
i need you to remember me kate
how i am right now right this very moment
i need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you no matter what happens
are you okay jack
please just promise me youll do that
you have to promise kate
because if you dont then its like it never happened and i dont think i could live with that
shes a bit confused but she couldnt be more in love with him
i promise jack
promise me again
come to bed honey
jack stands up heading toward the door
snow begins to fall
jack with lucy on a leash walking side by side his mind elsewhere
lucy leads him around a corner
to a large open field
she looks back at jack then out to the open field
jack removes the leash
the dog bounds happily out into the field looking for just the right spot
jack puts his hands in his coat pocket
pulls out a half eaten roll of peppermint lifesavers puts one in his mouth
he looks up at the sky snow gently falling onto his face
its cold but its beautiful
peaceful and still
the air clean and crisp
he breathes in the fresh air the lifesaver dissolving in his mouth watching the dog
the room is dark
jack enters sees kate sleeping soundly in bed
he sits down in a chair and watches kate asleep a sad look in his eyes
as he continues to watch her to listen to her his own eyelids appear to grow heavy
he tries to fight the sleep
opening his eyes
focusing on her
but its no use
finally he closes his eyes
falling into a deep sleep
jack flat on his back in bed
light streams onto his face
jack reaches over to kates side
theres no one there
pull back to reveal
his old manhattan apartment
his old dressy clothes strewn on the floor
jack sleep still in his eyes reaches over
hes not wearing any pajamas
picks up the phone
groggy dazed yeah
okay send her up
he drops the phone
turns back over
lets his eyes stay closed for another moment
his eyes open
he looks around
sees his shirtless torso
then his old apartment
tailored clothes on the floor
jack looks at the clock a
he gets out of bed throwing on pants and a pair of shoes and leaves the room
jack walks to the door just as
the doorbell rings
he stops then cautiously opens the door seeing
paula wearing a long overcoat and a wide smile on her face
waiting for me by the door huh
jack looks at her
paula opens her coat the only thing she has on underneath is a sexy little teddy
momentarily distracted thats totally see through
smiling merry christmas
it cant be christmas
jack stares at her totally confused
lasciviously its whatever you want it to be jack
jack grabs a leather jacket then walks right by a shocked paula and heads out the door practically running down the corridor
jacks ferrari speeds down the bridge toward jersey
jacks ferrari pulls up in the driveway and he hops out
he races to the front door pounding on it
a man in a van heusen shirt and hagar slacks answers
jack stares at him in shock
can i help you
is kate here
does kate live here
no theres no one here named kate
is that good enough for you
jack starts rapping his head against the door post much to the shock of the guy standing there
hey are you okay
is there anything i can do for you
jack shakes his head mournfully
hey my wifes in the kitchen
you got a cigarette
im sorry no
jack walks off beleaguered
jacks car drives by as arnie carries a bicycle box out to the garbage
the car screeches to a halt in front of the driveway
shouting at jack hey you cant park that thing here
out the window its me jack
i dont care if youre tim allen with your fancy car and all your tools you still cant park here
tell me you recognize me arnie
howd you know my name
we bowl together
we won a championship
i never won anything in bowling
arnie peers at jack through the window
wait a second
i went to high school with you
you played baseball right
at the ferrari youre doing well
remembering yes thats it
yes we went to high school together
you never really talked to me
i wanted to talk to you man
i guess i just wanted you to know we couldve been really good friends
a cell phone rings
a curious look on jacks face its been a while since hes heard that sound
answering phone hello
hey santa where are you
you were supposed to be here half an hour ago
the emergency strategy session
your trip to aspen
theyre all panicked here
silence from jack
are you going through the tunnel
finally jack shakes his head defeated
ill be there in twenty minutes
its a beehive of activity
jacks team anxiously going over reports and flow charts working the phones drinking coffee
jack enters still reeling from his experience taking a moment to observe the action
mintz spots him
into phone thank god jacks here
ill call you right back
he hangs up the phone as all eyes in the room turn to jack immediately fixating on how disheveled he looks
approaching jack are you okay
in a daze whats going on here
its not good
bob thomas has secretly been talking to a european drug company
were not sure which one julias on it right now
word is theyre willing to let him buy a minority stake and keep running the entire company
the global people are up in arms
they say we shouldve been prepared for this
were in trouble here jack
jack looks at alan for a minute
you know something alan
theres a much more assertive person somewhere inside of you
alan looks at him confused
but i think i like you better this way
is this another one of those sun tzu art of war tricks
a sad laugh from jack
so what are we gonna do jack
jack wallows for another moment in his own sadness
jack snaps out of it turning to alan and the rest of the group
ill tell you exactly what were going to do
youre going to do whatever you have to do to find out which european company hes been talking to
then im going to clean myself up fly to aspen and drink egg nog with bob thomas
his wife and kids will be playing in the background while i spend christmas day convincing him that the european company is the devil and global is the answer to
his prayers after all
growing wistful then im going to spend four hours skiing
on christmas day
completely and utterly alone
im going to do that because that is my life that is whats real and there is nothing i can do to change that
jack leaves the office to the shocked stares of his team
jacks limo makes its way downtown
jack in the back seat of the limo sadly looking out the window watching the buildings pass by
he turns away looks at the phone
haltingly picks it up
dialing for manhattan
i need an address too
jack jots something down on a business card
then he hangs up the phone thinks a moment looks out the window then turns to the driver
make a right here
but the airports the other way
were not going to the airport
jacks limo pulls up outside this house on washington mews
jack gets out
jack stands outside an apartment door
he hears the clashs london calling blaring from inside
he rings the bell
the volume of the music gets lower
kates assistant lori s opens the door
jack exchanges a curious look with her
are you from the shipping company
im jack campbell
im an old
friend of kates
i just called
the woman looks at him then walks back inside
some guys here
jack waits anxiously at the door
to lori did you call the airline like i asked
jacks eyes come alive as kate appears wearing jeans and a white blouse
except for her hair she looks the same
god its been so long
she searches for a kind word but he looks terrible
you look great
its good to see you
she looks at him another moment then turns
yelling inside lori
wheres that box
kate walks inside jack follows her in sheepishly
jack accidentally knocks into a stack of boxes sending a glass candy dish crashing to the floor shattering it
bending down im sorry
dont worry about it jack
jack looks up at
a beehive of activity lori on the phone boxes stacked everywhere two movers packing up
whats going on
searching around im moving to paris
it was right here
to lori its a box marked jack
i put it in the stack for the salvation army
to kate with attitude do you want me to look for the box or call the airline
hey kind of under a little pressure here
hey kind of giving up christmas day for my ex boss here
jack watches this back and forth
you didnt seem to mind offering to help me on christmas day when you were unwrapping that prada bag i gave you
maybe its by the wardrobe boxes
kate heads over to some tall wardrobe boxes
my firm has an office there and im going to be heading it up
stunned to paris
searching the boxes thats the one
so youre not at a non profit firm
a chuckle not with what they pay me
youre not married are you
no jack i never got married
looking around can we just take a minute here
maybe get a cup of coffee or something
yelling ill go for a cup of coffee
a relieved smile from jack
i found it
the la guardia flights canceled but i got you out of kennedy on united at nine
am i good or what
jacks smile disappears as kate hands him a sealed box marked jack
here you go
its just some old things of yours
jack stands here looking at the box then at kate
do you ever think about us kate
about what might have happened
a bemused laugh from kate
then she sees hes not laughing
a nod from jack
ill tell you what jack if youre ever in paris look me up
maybe well go for that cup of coffee
one of the movers passes by jack carrying a box
jack looks at kate flush with the realization that this isnt the same woman he knew thirteen years ago or left yesterday
a scratchy zeppelin album the song all of my love fills the room
jack a fifth of bushmills by his side goes through the box kate gave him
he removes a worn leather jacket feeling the soft material then a mondale for president button which jack smiles upon seeing a couple neil young concert ticket stubs
he puts the leather jacket on then sticks the mondale button on the lapel
he digs back into the box finding
a messy dog eared copy of cats cradle
not the one kate gave him at the airport the one she replaced
jack looks at it for a moment
lost in his sadness
he looks over at the clock it reads
jack in his ferrari racing down the highway at he looks at the clock it reads
he opens up the throttle
snow is falling as jacks car races up to the terminal then stops
he jumps out
an airport security guard sees him
hey you cant leave that there
jack runs into the terminal ignoring the guard
jack looking at the board
the nine oclock to paris gate a
jack sprints toward the gate
and gets there just as the flight is boarding
jack looks through the crowd spotting kate near the front of the line about to hand her ticket to the gate attendant
he pushes through the throng of people drawing some annoyed stares finally making his way over to kate
calling out kate
kate turns and sees jack a look of puzzlement on her face
you cant go
dont get on that plane
lets just go have a cup of coffee
thats all im asking for
im sure theres another flight to paris tonight
what do you want from me
you want me to tell you everything that happened was okay
jack just stands there unsure
well it is
yes i was heartbroken
but i got over it
i moved on
people change jack
i dont know why you suddenly feel the need to revisit that time in our lives but i assure you its over
kate turns her back to jack leaving him standing there
he watches her walk to the podium realizing shes right
he sees kate reach the podium
hand her ticket to the attendant
finally a look of determination crosses his face
at kate we have a house in jersey
kate turns to him with a look that could kill
dont do this jack
but he continues
we have two kids annie and josh
kate looks at him half mortified half interested
annies not much of a violin player but she tries really hard
shes a little precocious but thats only because she says whats on her mind
and when she smiles
jack shakes his head remembering fighting back the tears
he has your eyes
he doesnt say much but we know hes smart
lost in the memory hes always got his eyes open always watching us
sometimes you can look at him and just know that hes learning something new
its like witnessing a miracle
kates expression has sifted from annoyance to curiosity
the house is a mess but its ours
chuckling well after a hundred twenty two more payments it will be
jack begins walking slowly toward kate
the world of the airport going on around him jack not caring
youre a non profit lawyer
thats right completely non profit
but that doesnt seem to bother you
kate raises an eyebrow
its something shes thought about
and were in love
after thirteen years of marriage were still unbelievably in love
with a chuckle you wont even let me touch you until ive said it
jack gets closer and closer
kates spellbound now
imagining the picture jacks painting
i sing to you
not all the time but definitely on special occasions
jack walks into a piece of carry on luggage sitting by a row of passengers
off hand to passenger excuse me
to kate we made a lot of sacrifices dealt with our share of surprises but we stayed together
jacks nearly there
you see youre a better person than i am
not in this life and kate knows it
and it made me a better person to be around you
kate is perfectly still jacks words echoing in her ears
maybe it was all a dream
maybe i went to bed one lonely night in december and imagined it all
but i swear nothings ever felt more real to me
hes right in front of her
she cant take her eyes off him
and if you get on that plane right now itll disappear forever
jack and kate in their own little world
airport business going on around them
i know we can both go on with our lives
and wed both be fine
but ive seen what we can be like together
and i choose us
jacks words resonate in her ears
he gently touches a hand to her arm
please kate one cup of coffee
you can always go to paris
just please not tonight
she stands there frozen staring into jacks eyes searching for the answer
jack and kate framed in the window of a nearly empty airport coffee shop
through the window we see snow falling outside
from a distance we see them
talking and laughing over a cup of coffee
