written by eric roth based on the short story by f
scott fitzgerald as all things do it begins in the dark
eyes blink open
the first thing they see is a woman near standing looking out a window watching the wind blowing rattling a window
what are you looking at
the wind mother
they say a hurricane is on its way
youve been asleep
i was waiting to see you
now we see were in a hospital room with layers of white enamel paint trying without success to hide the years
an old woman past withered still regal with a green turban around her bald head is propped by pillows her blue eyes looking out at us from her bed
shes connected to an intravenous for sustenance and a morphine drip
her name is daisy fuller
she speaks with a southern lilt
if it wasnt for hurricanes we wouldnt have a hurricane season
ive forgotten what the weather can be like here
ive lived with four seasons so many years now
we see a young black woman a caregiver dorothy baker in a corner thumbing a magazine with one eye at the window
i saw on the news theyre predicting trouble
they stacked people like firewood to close a hole in a levee
but daisy has other things on her mind
it all runs together
like a fingerpainting
i feel like im on a boat drifting
tenderly can i do anything for you mother
make anything easier
there is nothing to do caroline
this is what it is
im finding it harder to keep my eyes open
my mouth all filled with cotton
and agitated feeling confined she scratches at her nightgown as if it were sticking to her
she starts to take it off
dorothy gets up and straightens it for her
there there miss daisy
youll scratch yourself to ribbons
to caroline its their way of letting go
the finality probly today
caroline is well aware of it but the words her admonition of death being so close at hand makes everything even more present
do you want more medication mother
the doctor said you can have all you want
daisy is quiet looking into the distance
caroline seeking closure sits on the bed with her and starts to cry
daisy puts her thin arms around her daughter comforting her
a friend told me she never had a chance to say goodbye to her mother
grateful to have the chance i wanted to thank you mother for bringing me into this world
for raising me so well
i wanted to tell you how much youve meant to me
im going to miss you so much
they hold each other for some time
and theres an awkwardness they have nothing left to talk about
nothing left to say to each other
a hole in their relationship
caroline fills it with the eternal question
are you afraid
what comes next
she winces at some physical pain
the pains coming more steadily
her breathing will falter soon
no need for her to suffer
she raises the morphine level
daisy closes her eyes
drifting with the morphine
and a thought a dream a sound crosses her mind
and she says
they built that train station in
your father was there the day it opened
he said a tuba band was playing
oom pah pah
and we see a tuba band is playing while a ribbon cutting ceremony is taking place across the steps of the new oom pah pah oom pah pah
the finest clockmaker in all of the south built that clock
we see an old french quarter storefront with an endless array of clocks and watches
his name was mr
the slightest of smiles crosses daisys lips
saying to herself again
we see a diminutive man in a frock coat with small delicate hands mr
cake working in his downstairs workshop
more than a few clocks stroke midnight a handsome creole woman comes into the workshop
he was married to a creole of evangeline parish and they had a son
taking his arm she helps him up to show him to his bed
did i mention mr
gateau was from birth absolutely blind
the clockmaker his fine hands blindly working
and when their son came of age like boys will do he joined the army
they saw him off at the old train station
an old wooden barn of a building
their son hugging his parents getting on a flatbed train crowded with other soldiers pulling away
gateau blindly waving his hat goodbye to his son
oh how he worked for months he did nothing but work on the clock for the great train station
the sound of clocks constant ticking
gateau at work
one day a letter came
blanche comes into the workshop
a letter in her hand
she reads to her blind husband
i am sorry to inform you that your son was killed fighting for his country at the battle of the marne
in the death of sgt
martin gateau i lose one of my most trusted men
when i informed members of our company he had fallen on every face could be seen the mark of sorrow
we were in hope the lord would spare him to return home together
alas this was not to be
i send along his pants shirt cavalry pin kerchief and haircomb
gateau done for the night went up to his bed
gateau blindly feeling his way up the stairs
and their son came home
we see mr
cake in his familiar hat his wife holding his arm standing among the rows of coffins
they buried him where the gateau family had been buried for a hundred and seven years
an old new orleans cemetery vines crawling the sepulchers
cake went back to work on his clock
laboring to finish
gateau blindly setting the last spring closing up the clock back
finished at last
it was a morning to remember
papa said there were people everywhere
and we see a large throng gathered to watch the unveiling of the clock
politicians citizens and pickpockets alike
even teddy roosevelt had come
and we see the distinctive figure of theodore roosevelt in overcoat and hat the war heavy on his shoulders
we watch mr
cake with the aid of an assistant climbing the scaffolding to his clock covered by a velvet drape
he stands for a moment
and with a simple tug releases the purple swath
people gasp at the magnificent clock
cake winds the clock which chimes a glorious chime
pushed by an angel the second hand begins its eternal journey
until they realize the clock is going the wrong way
traveling backwards in time
a man shouts its running backwards
i made it this way
so that perhaps the boys who were lost in the war might stand and go home again
and we see just that
bullets leaving mens wounds sailing back into the rifles from whence they came
limbs whole again
cannon balls rocketing backwards into the cannons breech
fallen come to their feet to live and breathe again
home to farm to work have children to live long full lives
teddy roosevelt bereft removes his hat
perhaps my own son might come home again
and we see his own son martin once again full of life hopping backward off the train to land where his journey started
back in the arms of his loving parents
im sorry if i offended anybody
i hope you enjoy my clock
and his wife holding his arm he makes his way across the terminal and exits
the crowd is motionless
they look to teddy roosevelt for guidance
but he simply puts his hat on and with his guardians is gone
mr cake was never seen again
some say he died of a broken heart
some say he went to sea
gateau blindly rowing
he just rowed
the wind loudly rattles the window
they turn to look
do you mind if i make myself a call
ive got somebody watching my little boy
no please go call
its quiet caroline sitting on the bed with her dying mother
with the wind knocking at the window
after some moments i hope i havent disappointed you mother
oh honey you could never disappoint me
i wished i had more to show for myself
i know you would have liked to have had grandchildren
my life hasnt been all that
as if to say the pieces havent all fit
trying to articulate it
im either a step ahead
or a step behind
a hat full of sand
going on i need my brown suitcase
caroline doing what shes asked goes over to one of the suitcases by the bed
she opens it
and among the clothes and the keepsakes there is indeed an old envelope
i tried to read it a hundred different times
but i couldnt bring myself
what do you mean
read it to me
daisy closes her eyes
caroline takes out a sheath of papers
its a journal of some kind written in longhand
pages have come undone
scraps of paper even some napkins
murmurs just the sound of your voice
and for her mothers sake she begins to read it
with no particular interest like reading to someone a selection from a menus choices
its dated april
it says new orleans
after a beat this is my last will and testament
which starts to engage her i dont have much to leave
few possessions no money really
i will go out of this world the same way i came in alone and with nothing
finding herself engaged all i have is my story
im writing it now while i still remember it
she looks over at her mother
but her mothers eyes are closed
my name is benjamin
and carolines voice becomes a young mans voice
and i was born under unusual circumstances
the war to end all wars had ended
we see the streets of new orleans are filled with drunken singing revelers
cars jamming the cobblestones people kissing shouting joyful
another burst of fireworks
i was told it was an especially good night to be born
and we see in the fireworks light a young man in his early s thomas button running up to the gate of a fashionable town home
he nearly collides with a priest who arrives there at the same time
thomas runs past him up the steps
he runs past a solemn maid and up a long staircase
barging into the master bedroom
where we see a young woman is lying on a bloody bed frantically being administered to by a doctor with the help of the small domestic staff
the priest enters
seeing him why are you here
thomas im afraid shes not going to survive
and the priest bends to say last rites over the pretty young woman
and the maids bringing bedsheets futilely start to change her bloody linens
all of you
they move out of the way
and thomas kneels beside his wife
shes pale white fear in her soft brown eyes
he takes her hand
i came as quickly as i could
im sorry i took so long the streets are filled with people
as if to underscore it fireworks go off
you are going to be alright my dearest darling
i will not let anything happen to you
promise me thomas
and she is interrupted by the sudden cry of a baby
but thomas cant take his eyes from his dying wife
promise me he has a place
he doesnt understand
she looks up at him
holds his hand tight
then she slips away
the doctor listening for her pulse
he covers her
the priests murmured incantations
the housemaids crying
she gave her life for me
and for that i am forever grateful
thomas still holding her hand is unable to let go
when we hear again the baby crying
the babys cry is not quite right
it is not an infants cry for succor or a natural cry to exercise its new lungs
its a deep haunting cry from some primal soul
they all turn and the room stills
listening as the baby continues its mournful wail
only thomas goes to answer
the baby in a basket swaddled in a thick blanket its face covered with cloth
thomas goes to lift it to see his sons face
he lifts the cloth anyway
for he has seen some kind of horror
he makes the smallest of sounds a whispered ohhhh
and then he suddenly snatches up the swaddled baby running with it out of the room
thomas tears on his face carrying his crying baby through the streets
pushing through crowds
he comes along an old bridge over a waterway
the air heavy with the haze of fireworks
the water dark
brokenhearted he lifts the baby to throw it into the black water
he is just at the apex of this throw when despite his sadness he cant bring himself to do it
instead cradles the newborn
im so sorry
a lantern lights his face
a policeman down the way
what are you doing there
the baby starts to cry
what do you have there
thomas takes off
the policeman after him
thomas carrying the crying baby running
thomas scuttling with the crying infant through narrow streets past the back porches and the back stairs of the large old moldering antebellum houses
he comes to an old three story house with a screened porch voices from inside
people talking and laughing
the baby soothed by the soft yellow light by the music of the voices by the house itself stops its mournful cry
thomas stops catching his breath
he looks in through the back porch
the sounds of voices coming
thomas quietly sets the baby on the back porch steps
he takes out every last dollar he has tucking the money inside the babys blanket
we can just see the figures of two people coming from inside
thomas knocks on the weathered screen door
and his decision made he turns moving away from the house leaving his child behind
i couldve sworn i heard somebody knockin
when a young black woman in a green dress comes onto the porch
a thin attractive woman in her late s with the sultry eyes of a lounge singer shes known as queenie
shes followed by a handsome black man mr
weathers that everyone calls tizzy
she looks out the door and not seeing anything
i guess not
she stands for a moment taking in the night air
the air smells sweet
and she sings to herself
a song from the time
you look very handsome tonight ms
queenie handsome as i ever seen you
the green matches your eyes
fingering dress it isnt everyday a wars over mr
we have to mark it somehow
you aint no slouch yourself
he smiles tips his hat
and they stand in the quiet
hamberts back in town
came home legless but he home
were gonna throw a party for him
help get himself situated
beat i know you was sweet on him one time
sweeter than i shoulda been
lost his legs you say
you never know whats comin for you
and if right on cue an older white woman sticks her head out
simone messed herself
she got to stop doing that or its diapers for her
ill be right there mrs
the woman disappears inside
queenie not anxious to go
it sure is nice out here mr
awful nice ms
come out back for a moment
take your mind away from things
he pushes open the porch screen door
smiles just a moments time
he offers her his hand
she takes it
he backs out of the house holding her hand and he suddenly steps right on top of the baby
the baby wails tizzy stumbles nearly falls
what in gods name
what is that
a fish crawl out of the river
she moves to it
pushes aside the blanket and freezes
god in heaven
it is the very first time we have seen the baby
what we see is the prominent bald head of any newborn
but it has the face the wrinkled skin the faded eyes of an octogenarian
indeed if we didnt know any better it would seem the newborn was a wrinkled decrepit sad eyed old man
my goodness the lord did something here
look like a milk wagon run over it
and theyre both motionless not quite sure what to do
i didnt see it layin there
i hope i didnt hurt it none
steppin on it like that
the baby wont stop its mournful cry
we best leave it to the police
ill go queenie hesitates
its for sure nobody wanted to keep it
and making up her mind she suddenly grabs up the crying baby taking it inside
tizzy anxiously whispering something going in after her
a pianos playing a standard people singing
theres a myriad of old dark rooms
heavy furniture and carpets
an eclectic mixture of the possessions of those who have lived and died here over many years
and we see a parlor is crowded with old people from sixty to ninety five in various stages of health
various contraptions to keep them afloat
an old age home
we see queenie moving quietly along a hallway carrying the crying baby so as not to be seen
tizzy following her still anxiously whispering after her
where are you queenie
hold your water
and to tizzy go see to them
he does what she asks
she hurries the baby into a small room literally like a mouse house under the stairs
a small room tucked under the staircase
she went and messed herself all over again
jane childress start her a bath
and mind your business mrs
youll be messing yourself soon enough too
theres a knock on queenies door
whispers somebody stole my necklace
ill be right with you mrs
she whispers to the baby soothing it
and looking for a place to put it she opens a dresser drawer
you may be as ugly as an old pot
but you still a child of god
she wont go take a bath witout you
mercy ill be right there
and with that she puts the baby into the top dresser drawer
with her unmentionables
and shuts it
leaving it open just a crack enough to breathe
turning she sees an old woman looking very lost looking in the room
my sister gave those pearls to me
i cant find them anywhere
people are stealing my jewelry
theyre right here mrs
hollister right round your pretty white neck
moving her come on now
theres a sound of a door chime
rose has arrived for his visit
queenie takes a concerned look back at the baby and closes the door
and we stay behind for a moment
inside queenies underwear drawer with the smell of a lilac sachet
is the baby with the face of an old man
looking up at the sliver of light coming into the dresser drawer
we see the doctor an older man in a tired suit who has done this longer than he cares to remember finishing examining one of the elderly boarders
he puts his things into his doctors bag
queenie comes beside him saying something
the baby is lying on queenies bed
rose stethoscope ever dangling washes his hands in a sink
hes nearly blind from cataracts
im not sure he can hear
his bones indicate severe arthritis
his skin has lost all elasticity
his hands and feet are ossified
he has all the deterioration the infirmities not of a newborn but of a man well in his eighties on the way to his grave
you mean to say hes dying
of old age
his body is failing him before his lifes begun
theyre still looking at the strange baby
where did he come from
after a beat its my sisters child
she had an unfortunate adventure
whispers the poor child got the worse of it
came out white
there are places for unwanted babies like these queenie
theres no room for another mouth to feed here
the nolan foundation despite their good intentions thinks this place is a large nuisance as it is
a baby here appealing you said he dont have long
queenie some creatures arent meant to survive
she looks at the baby determined
he is a miracle thats for certain
just not the kind of miracle one hopes to see
the old people are sitting around the parlor talking playing cards
queenie brings the baby bundle into the room
you all listen
and they stop what they are doing
we have a visitor that will be staying with us for a little while
my sister had a child but couldnt see right by it
hes known as
a hesitation naming him benjamin
she likes the sound of it benjamin
hes not a well child
so we need to take very good care of him
we see tizzys come out of the kitchen watching with an air of strong disapproval
and an old woman says
i had ten children
theres not a baby i cant care for
let me see him
queenie hesitates and gives the baby to her
the old woman pushes the blanket back from the babys face
startled god in heaven he looks just like my ex husband
and theres laughter
hes prematurely old
doctor rose said he dont have much time on this earth
join the club
they all laugh
their laughter makes the baby seem to smile
the lonely smile of an old dying man
we see queenie unable to sleep lying in bed looking out a small window
theres a light knock on the door
hambert sends his remembrance to you
the baby cries out
and then its quiet
meaning the baby are you right out of your mind
i know you dont got all the parts it takes to make one of your own
but this isnt yours to keep
this isnt even human kind
with nothing left to be said he starts to go
stay with me tonight
and she whispers you never know whats comin for you
and as they move to be with one another to make love we look over at the dresser drawer open just a crack
benjamin lying among the unmentionables looking out at the world
i found a home
caroline with the journal on her knees
daisy eyes closed
the wind gathered in strength
is any of this true
you have such a lovely voice
she looks through the book
some pages seem to be torn out here
she discovers inside
theres an old streetcar token
she gives it to her mother folding her hand around it
but daisy is somewhere else looking out the window
just kept going year after year after year
and we see mr
cakes clock with its cherubs pushing the hands of progress still marking time backwards
the year is now
i didnt know i was a child
i thought i was like everyone else who lived there an old man in my golden years
the boarders eating dinner
queenie in a white uniform
along with tizzy wearing a chefs hat and apron helping her serve
we move across the ancient faces
until we come to one particular face
wearing eyeglasses now
but the same wrinkled face weve come to know
the face of a very old man
the face of benjamin button when he should normally be a six year old
hes sitting in a wheelchair now
small shrunken hunched with age legs and hands crippled with arthritis
eyeglasses are just one addition
a hearing aid
a bulky apparatus of its time is in one ear
but if we look even closer we can see there are sprouts of hair
wisps of white
what would be the last hair for some
seem to be growing in
as we watch him eat he uses his fork like a child might banging it just for the hell of it making noise
stop bangin that fork
fixing it in his arthritic hand its for eating not for playin with
and use your napkin please mr
and he does as hes told
a staff member helps one of the old men feeding him
benjamin just another old man having dinner with his contemporaries
a line of old people in rockers
benjamin like any six year old bored wheels his chair back and forth between them
until one of the oldsters who has had enough sticks his cane in the spokes of his wheelchair making him come to an abrupt stop
benjamin sitting with the other oldsters on the porch
the old people rocking
sounds drift from the street beyond the wall
nobody says anything rocking
benjamin eternally curious needing to know suddenly wheels himself precariously to the very edge of the porch where the wall is lower and he just sees the street
children running on the street playing
carriages dropping people off for a party
he leans forward to get an even better view
when queenie suddenly grabs him
come back here
rolling his wheelchair away from the edge to the safety of the old people
out of sight of the street
the small room with the small window
we see benjamin in a bed made on the floor
queenie in her bed
i loved her very much
she was my mother
and he reaches to hold her hand
she generously takes his hand
and they lay like that holding hands queenie in bed her son the old man on the floor
somedays i feel like im different from the day before
everybody feels different about themselves one way or another
were all goin the same way just taking different roads to get there
youre on your own road benjamin
how much longer do i have to live mother
just be thankful you got what youre given
you already here longer than you supposed to be
we see the door quietly open tizzy coming in
some nights i would have to sleep alone
he looks at benjamin his signal to pick him up carrying him out of the room sitting him in his wheelchair tizzy going back down into the room to be
shutting the door
an old womans fallen fast asleep in an easy chair a book on her lap
benjamin sitting alone in his wheelchair listening to the sounds of the house
i didnt mind
i would listen to the house breathing
all the people sleeping
i felt safe
be he still wants to know whats over there
he wheels himself over to sit at the window looking outside
looking at the streetlights the world beyond the gate
trying to see whats dangerous
it was a place of great routine
every morning at no matter the weather
general winslow u
raised the flag
and we see the very elderly general winslow doing just that
raising the flag in a downpour only
and as queenie comes running across the lawn with a coat for him
theres the sound of someone singing mrs
sybil wagner once a noted opera singer
well shed sing wagner
we see a victrola playing mrs
wagner in her nightgown at a window singing with the musical accompaniment at the top of her lungs
while down the hall we see queenie giving benjamin a bath
massaging his poor crippled legs
were gonna put some life into these old sticks for you
get you walkin
breakfast was served promptly at six
we see benjamin in his wheelchair under tizzys tutelage learning to cook
and simultaneously to read
how we doin
whats that say there
thats a v not a b
now you talkin
some staff come in getting platters of food
how many parts butter we got
how many parts flour
how much is four and two
tizzy smacks the back of his head
youre a regular addin machine
dinner was served promptly at six
tizzy washing dishes
benjamin working with him
putting away cans
reading from one of the labels
tomato brown sugar salt myasses
tizzy swats at him with his dish towel
and while washing the dishes
i learned to read when i was five
my grandfather was a dresser for a famous actor
hed bring home every play for me to read
shakespeare kind keepers of my weak decaying age let dying mortimer here rest himself
even like a man new haled from the rack
so fare my limbs with long imprisonment
and these gray locks the pursuivants of death nestor like aged in an age of care argue the end of edmund mortimer
benjamins mouth agape awed taken by him his majesty
you thought i was plain ignorant didnt you
benjamin never thought about it
the actor my grandfather worked for was john wilkes booth
he killed abraham lincoln
you never know
an old man looks in
when its served
now sit your wrinkly butt back down mr
on saturday nights i would go to queenies church
a sweltering shout em up negro gospel tent
queenie pushes benjamin in his wheelchair past a line of people looking to be healed bringing him face to face with a mountain of a preacher pouring sweat and full
what can i do for you sister
and queenie whispers something to him
her parts are all twisted up inside so she cant have little children
he puts his hand on her stomach
lord if you could see clear to forgive this woman her sins so she can bear the fruit of the womb
and shouts out damnable affliction
he presses on her stomach
making queenie nearly fall over
held up by a nurse in a crisp white uniform
and once shes regained her balance
at benjamin and whats this old mans irrediction
hes got the devil on his back
trying to ride him into the grave before his time
touches benjamin out zebuchar
after a beat how old are you
and he says what is only true
im seven but i look a lot older
laughs god bless you
the congregation laughs
this is a man who has optimism in his heart
belief in his soul
we are all children in the eyes of god
now we are going to get you out of that chair
were gonna have you walk
his hands on bens shoulders in the name of gods glory rise up
and benjamin doing what hes asked barely able to his legs akimbo stands
the people all applaud
now god is going to see you the rest of the way
hes going to see this little old man walk without the use of a crutch or a cane
hes going walk by himself on faith and divine inspiration alone
well show that devil where to go
and benjamin takes two very precarious steps and his poor arthritic legs give out
and he sprawls to the floor
the aides in white nurses uniforms move to help but dont touch him
kneeling to benjamin rise up old man
but benjamin stays crumpled on the floor
the preacher comes to his feet standing like a mountain over him
rise up like lazarus
benjamin still lies on the floor
i said rise up
and benjamin slowly but surely makes his way to his feet
yes and say hallelujah
now walk my old friend
and benjamin one crippled leg at a time hobbles across the stage
the people urging him on
a string of hallelujahs
queenie comes to join him
let the lord carry you
the preacher walking along with him more a dance than a walk shouting the name of the lord
queenie and the preacher walking benjamin across the stage
benjamin making it to the other end
to a roar of amens
now when i look back on it it was kind of miraculous
but you know the saying
the lord giveth and the lord taketh away
that mountain of a preacher
in full exaltation to god
praise be to the lord on the highest
suddenly pitches over flat on his face
having had a spontaneous coronary
lying center stage deader than the proverbial doornail
the crisp uniformed nurses running to attend to him and poor old benjamin haplessly looking around
the people are gathered
there were birthdays
a lit cake is being brought in celebrating general winslows birthday
he stares at the cake unhappily gets up mutters something
the oldsters eye the cake and without a moments hesitation dig in
and mortality was a common visitor to our house
people came and went
death was so frequent i was never afraid of it
wagners window open
and not a sound coming out
you could hear when someone left us
there was a silence in the house
a small funeral at an old cemetery
and while die valkyrie plays on her crank victrola an old man bangs cymbals as a grand finale to the music
while we see sybil wagner laid to rest to sing in another choir benjamin with his wondrous ancient face sitting in his wheelchair with the old people on the porch
watching the sun go down
it was a wonderful place to grow up
i was with people who had put away all the inconsequences of life left in a state of purely being
wondering about the weather
the temperature of a bath
the light at the end of the day
and one of them as if to underscore the point farts
for everyone that died someone would come to take their place
and we see benjamin coming into the kitchen
tizzy busy preparing lunch
benjamin stops seeing a tiny african man his back to us surrounded by old people standing on the lawn
he hears him telling them
my first wife and i are captured by neighbor tribe cannibals
the old people shrink at the mention
i escaped across the river
wide eyed you escaped cannibals
my wife she cant swim so she eaten
telling benjamin thats mr
hes an acquaintance of an acquaintance of mine
hell be stayin with us in the staff quarters for awhile
telling old people second wife stepped on viper and dies
jocular it was bad luck to be married to mr
i am captured with six others by baschiele tribe
they sell us to a big white man
he instinctively turns and sees benjamin standing in the window watching him
oti spots him he quickly moves out of the window out of sight
we see benjamin lying on the floor by the stairs playing with some metal army men
otis distinctive laugh his voice drifts up from under the stairs
benjamin getting his canes goes to look
oti standing under the stairs in an alcove with some of the help telling them his life story
but its a completely different tone
a mockery of white people and their insanity
the big white man brings us to st
louis where they make our village at the worlds fair
they have us livin in these little huts like were livin in africa
people behind bars staring at us
we told not to look at them
to just go about our normal lives
what the hell they talkin about
they all laugh
at night were done bein savages
we go over the wall into the rosebud
we drank and laughed until the sun come up
and then we savages again
they nod enjoying the idea
and as mr
oti senses benjamins presence turning
benjamin retreating on his canes as fast as he can back up the stairs
benjamin sitting at the dining room table reading an oversized book of imaginary beings
he senses a presence
oti sits down across from him
i hear you not so old as you looking
you just foolin everybody
what happen you get madjembe
whats a madjembe
i dont think so
this is just how i am
oti looks out at the street
you want to get a cold root beer
an echo its dangerous
who said that
he gets up ready to go
he can see queenie busy leaning out a window banging dust from a rug
last chance come on little man
despite knowing the consequences he takes up his canes and follows ngunda outside
they come outside
children on the street playing
seeing benjamin they come to a dead stop
staring at the freak from the old peoples home with another freak
oti suddenly runs into the street
benjamin tries as best he can to keep up
oti darts directly in front of a street car waving his arms making it come to an abrupt stop
another white man come to my country and say he want to talk to me
we move along the aisle of a streetcar
the various people
then i am in the monkey house at philadelphia zoological park
three thousand people show up my first day
benjamin and ngunda siting in the back of the streetcar behind a moveable metal bar that has coloreds painted on it
oti taking a slug from a flask
a group of school children nearby cant take their eyes off the two of them
oti takes his wallet out taking out a folded piece of newspaper showing it to benjamin
bushman shares cage with park apes
whats it like living in a cage
the monkeys they do some tricks
i throw spear
i wrestle with kowali she is orangutan
they have me file my teeth like a cannibal
he shows him his teeth filed into points like a cannibal
when im not playing with monkeys they want me to run to bars in my cage with teeth to scare little children
and he suddenly jumps up and does just that charging with his teeth bared at the school children
oti taking his seat again laughs with benjamin
benjamin ecstatic his head out the streetcar window mr
oti holding onto the back of his breeches from falling
benjamin feeling the wind and the city wash over him
benjamin and mr
oti sitting on a bench at the peristyle of a park
benjamin takes his first slug of a coca cola taking too big a hit the coke pouring out of his nose
oti gives him a handkerchief
after hes wiped himself up
why didnt you go back home
war between english and dutch people had broken up kingdom
what did you do
i leave zoo
but i alone
you were all alone
youll see little man plenty times you be alone
you different like us its gonna be that way
but i tell you a little secret i find out
we know we alone
fat people skinny people tall people white people
they just as alone as us
but they scared shitless
he smiles a knowing smile
not a thing wrong with being alone
he looks out
i think about the river i grew up on
it would be good to sit by my river again
he looks at his watch
he suddenly gets up
oti and benjamin coming along the street music pouring out
they reach a corner where a tall octoroon woman is waiting
she broadly smiles seeing mr
theres my little man
you ready sugar
smiles pure ngunda always ready
introduces filamena mr
respectful of his age its a pleasure to meet you sir
to benjamin you can find your own way home cant you
although hes not sure he can
he nods yes
charles avenue line to napoleon
and with that his arm around filamenas waist the two of them laughing walk off
benjamins left standing on the street corner
he looks around to get his bearings
he moves along bourbon street
a streetcar comes along bell clanging it rushes by him
he watches it go
clasping his canes determined he starts walking
bent over one cane after the other
making his way along the street
we see benjamin coming back to the gate
and we hear where in gods name have you been
and we see queenie standing on the porch
shes worried sick
she sees his hands are bleeding from blisters
queenie cleaning his hands
like to scare the holy hell out of me
i was so worried about you
you take my breath away
it had been the best day of my life
and the caregiver dorothy baker comes back in
she feels daisys pulse straightens her pillow
hows her breathing
after a beat theyre sayin its gonna reach us late in the day
im goin to get my baby and take him to my sisters
they said theres nothin to worry about here in the hospital
nurses are right here if you need them
ill see you in about an hour if thatll be okay
no thats fine
its momentarily quiet the wind knocking at the window
was there just company
dorothy had to go home
but daisys mind is elsewhere
gesturing for her to keep reading
caroline looks back at the book
daisy closes her eyes
on sundays the families would come and visit
the boarders on the lawn with their loved ones
and we see an old man walking with the aid of a cane coming out of the house onto the lawn
and as he moves through the people we see its benjamin
he has a single cane standing more upright now a distinctive shock of white hair eyebrows
a distinguished looking man in his seventies or in normal years a growing twelve year old boy
it was thanksgiving i met the person who changed my life forever
a chauffeured car has stopped
a man is standing in the road looking at the house through the gates
and we realize its thomas button
looking for a glimpse of his son
benjamin instinctively turns but its too late his fathers back in the car being driven away
he turns an older woman nearby
politely why good day mrs
might i say you are looking strikingly youthful
a single cane your back as straight as an arrow
what elixir have you been drinking
and theres a voice that cuts through the day
grandma look at me
benjamin and grandma fuller turn to see a little girl no more than eight standing on a picnic table top doing pirouettes one after another for an admiring group of
she full curtsies bowing the way dancers do head to chest
then raising her head laughing
now that was really something
come on over here you
this is my granddaughter daisy
this is mr
benjamin im afraid i dont rightly know your last name
benjamin is just fine
i would never the rest of my life forget those blue eyes
and with great dignity calling to all good people supper is soived
the families along with ngunda and filamena are gathered in the dining room their heads bowed in prayer
we see daisy across from benjamin
the prayers finished its noisy
we pray to bembe
the creator of all living things
she retired after all that work
needing to top that did you know turkeys arent really birds
why do you say that
theyre in the pheasant family
they can hardly fly
its sad dont you think
a bird that cant fly
i like birds that cant fly
theyre easy to eat
standing i have something to tell you all
while were giving thanks for gods blessings
ive had a miracle happen
she touches her stomach the lord saw fit to answer my prayers
the people applaud the good news
what does she mean answered her prayers
shes going to have a baby silly
thats what my mother said when i was going to have a little brother
he didnt live long though
he didnt breathe right
and we can see benjamins heart beginning to break
he looks over tizzy proudly smiling
and as queenie accepts congratulations
benjamins old wrinkled face watching her
looks like hes going to cry
we see an abstract black and white drawing
and we hear a womans voice
this is the picture of old man kangaroo at five in the afternoon
an old finger comes in pointing to a drawing
we see benjamin and daisy sitting close together on a sofa and daisys grandmother arm encircling them is reading to them from rudyard kiplings just so stories
you can tell its late because of the shadow here
benjamin and daisy sitting rapt while she finishes reading to them
its the time old man kangaroo got his beautiful hind legs just as
i hope im saying this right
just as big god ngog had promised
you can see that its five oclock because big god ngogs pet tame clock says so
finishing isnt that something
both daisy and benjamin thrilled say again
read it again
alright once more
but afterwards forgetting benjamins age both of you must promise to go to bed
they both i promise
and as she starts to read all over again
we see benjamin asleep in bed with one of the old men mr
the door opens
and daisy in her nightgown has come inside
she slightly touches benjamin
whispers are you sleeping
he shakes no
whispers come on
she moves quickly out of the room and benjamin gets up and with the aid of his cane follows her
the old house still
daisy moving quietly down the stairs
benjamin his cane softly thumping the steps following her
whispers where are we going
she doesnt say anything
she leads him into the dining room
where we see the wash has been draped sheets and pillowcases like ghosts over the dining room table and a smaller side table and a buffet
and she ducks under a sheet beneath the dining table
benjamin follows her into the fort
nobody knows about this but us
the little girl and the old man with the maturity of a ten year old boy enjoying their secret lair
she takes a candle out of the folds of her nightgown
she tries to light it but doesnt really know how to use matches
will you light it
im not supposed to use matches
dont be chicken
despite his caution he lights the candle
the candlelight making it feel more secret
ill tell you a secret then you tell me one
whispers i saw mommy kissing another man
her face was red from it
benjamin doesnt know what to say
your turn to tell
im younger than i look
whispers you dont seem like an old person
like my grandma
are you sick
whispers i heard tizzy and my mother whisper
they said i was going to die soon
smiles but i fooled them so far
daisy looks at him in the flickering candlelight
you are different than anybody i have ever met
she innocently reaches to touch the skin on his cheek to see what it feels like
when suddenly a sheet is pulled back and daisys grandmother is standing there
what are you doing under there
whos idea was this candle
she angrily blows it out
taking her by the arm
its after midnight you come right out here and get back up to bed
and for benjamin but saying it to daisy you are not to be playing together
play with people your own age
moving her along now you come back to bed young lady
youre too young to be wandering around in the night by yourself
and a last word to benjamin you should be ashamed of yourself
and theyre gone
benjamin left sitting along under the sheets
theres a slight sound and he sees queenie in her nightgown standing in the doorway
you are a different child
a man child
people arent going to understand how different you are
forlorn whats wrong with me mother
god hasnt said yet
now back to bed and behave yourself
he crosses up the back stairs with the aid of his cane and mr
oti like a spectre is sitting on one end of the back steps smoking a cigarette drinking form his flask
he looks at benjamin as he goes by
takes a drink you get used to it
shouts you get back in that bed or ill cane your old ass
benjamin turns down the hallway and slips into the bedroom benjamin climbing back into bed with the old man
turning his back to the old man
daws unable to sleep
did i ever tell you ive been struck by lightning seven times
once when i was fixing a leak on the roof
and we see just that the old man on a roof getting blasted
once when i was crossing the road to get the mail
and we see that the man peacefully crossing a country road to get the mail getting hit by lightning
but benjamin just lays there looking out the window
all he can think about
i never forgot her blue eyes
the words linger
daisy her extraordinary blue eyes lying on her death bed
the rattle of the window in the wind
are you alright mother
she nods yes
he loved you from the first time he saw you
she doesnt say anything
without complaint nobody has ever loved me that way
impelling her go on
he crossed out something
and then hes written
when the baby came things were different
we see benjamin in his pajamas quietly coming into the kitchen for something to eat
and he slows seeing queenie taking a moment to herself sitting at the kitchen table peacefully breast feeding her infant
as benjamin slips back out unseen closing the door after him
we see benjamin lying on a small bed in the attic
cluttered with years of accumulated things
i moved into my own room in the attic
i realized despite a house filled with people that i loved i was alone
theres a noise
and we see ngunda oti is at the door a suitcase in hand
i come to say goodbye
im going away
i dont figure that out yet
i will send you a postcard when i get to there
what about your friend
the tall lady
were not friends anymore
thats what happens with tall people
he starts to go
and hes gone
benjamin gets up going to the window
he looks outside
he can see mr
oti come onto the porch
theres a full moon
and as he walks off his arrogant little walk suitcase in hand going out the gate benjamin watches him disappear into the night
i spent a lot of time by myself that year
benjamin sitting at a table an old man to look at but no more than twelve busy playing with magnets
we see a refined genteel old woman wearing a hat and gloves a suitcase at her feet flanked by an old dog just inside the front door
im moving in today
and just then queenie appears the baby on her hip
we was expecting you
to benjamin could you show her upstairs
she will be staying in mrs
rousseaus old room
ill be right with you with some fresh towels
frowning we dont usually let dogs in the house
hes as old as the hills
can hardly get around he wont be a bother much longer
benjamin like any young boy immediately pets the old dog
i guess as long as he stays out from underfoot
benjamin helps her with her bags showing her up the stairs
the old dog dutifully following them
the woman starts to tell him her name
but we dont hear it because
after a beat as hard as i try i cant remember her name
lawson or mrs
hartford or maybe it was maple
its funny how sometimes the people we remember the least make the greatest impression on us
benjamin sits petting the dog while the woman puts her things away
i remember she wore diamonds
and she always dressed in fine clothing as if she was going out
although she never did and nobody would ever come to visit her
we see the woman dressed nicely sitting in a chair reading a book
she takes a look out the window at the families on the lawn and bends back to her book
she taught me how to play the piano
the woman sitting with benjamin teaching him how to play piano
playing a classical piece like chopin
benjamin trying his hand
sounding pretty bad
it isnt how well you play its how you feel about what youre playing
whispers try this
and she plays a ragtime piece
new orleans music
music for the other whole part of the soul
benjamin tries his hand and actually plays it fairly well you cannot help but put your entire self into the music
and he plays along with her
a piece he wont soon forget
there were many changes going on some you could see
some you couldnt
we see benjamin taking a bath
an he notices a single gray hair floating on the surface
hair had started growing in all sorts of places
and he sees some hair is under his arms
and as he looks downward
along with other things
benjamin naked looking at himself in a mirror
like a young teenage boy
i felt like i could do anything that i could sprout wings
and as he flexes his muscles feeling like a man
its started to rain the wind blowing splattering rain against the window
oh darlin the pain
ill get the nurse
she hurries out of the room
daisy looks out the window
the maelstrom of wind and rain
caroline comes back with a nurse
youre not feeling too good
she adjusts the morphine drip
daisy lays back
nobody seems to know whether to stay or leave
the roads are filled from new orleans to baton rouge already
i think im gonna ride it out
finishing with the drip there that should make things easier
daisy starts to feel the effects of the drip
to caroline have you had a chance to say your goodbyes
the nurse nods
my father waited four hours for my brother to get here from boger city
he couldnt go without him
she affectionately touches daisys cheek
she seems like a sweet woman
i havent spent as much time as i would have like with her the last few years
another nurse looks in
the nurse quickly goes out of the room
caroline sits back down looking at her mother
daisy opens her eyes
they look at each other
caroline knowing daisy wants to hear the sound of her voice
taking up the book the next page says
daisy shuts her eyes
queenie would let me go with mr
daws to bridge city
to watch the boats go up and down the river
the busy docks
men waiting hoping to find work
these were hard times
people were doing anything they could to find work
and we see benjamin with mr
daws the lightning man sitting on a bench with a line of other old men killing time watching the boats going up and down the river
did i ever tell you i was struck by lightning seven times
once when i was in a field tending to my cows
and we see just that mr
daws along with a cow of his being hit by lightning
shouts my fourt hand didnt show up
anybody want to make for a days work around here
and he sees a man in his late s with his three man crew standing on the deck of a tugboat and old rusted tug built out of charcoal iron
the man its captain mike
has a thick irish accent
for some reason none of the able bodied men needing work respond
whats wrong nobody wants to get their hands dirty
nobody wants to do an honest days work for an honest days pay
warning them he never pays
he always says hell have to owe it to you
are all you afraid of workin for a livin
somebody got to want a job
benjamin suddenly springs up at the opportunity waving his arms
you got your sea legs old man
feeling his legs i do
thats good enough for me
get your ass on board well sure as hell find out
and as benjamin gets on the boat heading out to sea
and we see benjamin learning the ropes
helping to tow the freighters into and out of the river ports
benjamin in this element like a boy his hair blowing thrilled to be on the boat thrilled by the adventure
willing to do anything
i was as happy as i could be
i would do anything
i needs a volunteah
motioning scrape off this bird shit
right away sir
and he hops to it
happily scraping off the bird shit
happy to be doing anything
and i actually was going to be paid for something i would have done for free
ill put you on the books
pay you next time around
his name was captain mike clark
hed been on boats since he was seven
mikes a hard drinker gods last angry man
hes drinking as they go in for the night
benjamin sitting with him in the wheelhouse
mike jawing away
what were you born to do old timer
i havent found out yet

cant believe his ears you been on this earth for more than seventy years and you never got any
thats the saddest thing i ever heard in my life
well then hell man you comin with me
he took me to meet some friends
music playing loud
we see benjamin and capt mike at the bar
you dint say
what did your father do
i never met my father
youre a lucky bastard
all fathers want to do is hold you down
out on my fathers boat working da two a days
this littl fat bastard tug irish what they calls them
they say the irish the only ones stupid nough to work a tug
them and the portuguese as we all know how stupid them portuguese is
i finly get up the nerves and tell him

you know what im sayin
you didnt want to spend the rest of your life on a tugboat
absolutely damn right
so you know what my father says
he says who the hell you think you are
what the hell you think you can do
i tell him
well if you askin i want to be a artist
he says if god wanted you to be an artist he would made you one
god wanted you to work a tugboat just like me and thats what you goin to do
now if i ever hear you mention art again ill throw you overboard
well i went and i show him
i made myself an artist
and he suddenly takes off his shirt pulls down his pants
and we see hes covered from head to toe with his artwork and incredible array of tattoos
a tattoos artist
i puts every one on myself
and they look it upside down sideways and backwards
you have to skin me alive to take my art away from me now
when im dead im going to send him my arm
dont let anyone tell you different
you got to do what you meant to do
and i happen to be a god damned artist
stating the obvious but youre a tugboat captain
which stops captain mike in mid rant
and he has no answer for
his only response is to glare at benjamin
a back door opens a slinky woman coming in
captain mike were ready for you and your friend
lets go old timer
break your cherry
this ones on me
as they go
reconsidering and heres you pay for today
dont ever let anybody tell you captain mike didnt give a man what he deserved
looks at change he was given i thought it was for a days work
you cant put a price on education
captain mike and benjamin in a small parlor where girls both black and white are sitting around
it was a night to remember
captain mike knows just who he wants and moves off with her
benjamin left standing not knowing what to do
none of the women seem to anxious to be with the old man
he gives me the willies
hes not for me no ways
a thin girl maybe of mixed ethnicity decides to take a chance
how are you tonight grandpa
and we see benjamin and the girl sitting on a bed
and as she undresses him
first things first
tossing him a wash cloth
clean yourself up
he doesnt know what she means
taking the wash cloth he goes over to the sink and does what he knows how to do wash his face
is that any better
shes pushing him down hiking up her skirt all business
times a wastin
she climbs on top of him
and instinct takes over
but benjamin being just a boy
and this being the first time his excitement gets the immediate best of him
hopping up come by anytime
she starts to leave
but benjamin who likes this an awful lot
she looks and sees sure enough
she climbs back on
the results are virtually the same if a bit longer my hats off to you old timer
she gets up to go
shes made it to the door
when benjamin says
she slows turns to look
and sure enough
hes as ready as hes ever going to be
as she looks at him a look bordering on amazement
what are you dick tracy or something
ive got to rest
and thats just what shes doing
trying to catch her breath
in heaven again
and we see benjamin at the door happily smiling
hurting no thank you
benjamin floating on air hovering never wants to leave
have a nice night
youll be here tomorrow
every night but sunday
and shes finally able to go
it sure made me understand the value of earning a living
the things it can buy you
benjamin turns to leave
we hear footsteps
and we see a man putting on a raincoat coming downstairs from one of those other rooms
we see its benjamins father
seeing benjamin he slows
benjamin unaware of who he is turns and goes out
its a rainy night
benjamin feeling like a million bucks walks along the street going home
a chauffeured car pulls alongside him the window rolled down
and we see thomas button in the car
its awful wet out
can i offer you a ride somewhere
thats very kind of you sir
he gets into the car
they drive in awkward silence
my name is thomas thomas button
saying the name to himself benjamin
its a pleasure to know you
they shake hands
would you like to stop and have a drink benjamin
a small old bar
benjamin and his father sitting in the back
the waiter comes over deferring to benjamins age
what will it be sir
ill have whatever hes having
a sazerac for both of us
with whiskey instead of brandy
the waiter leaves
you dont drink do you
its a night for firsts
how is that
ive never been to a whore house either
it certainly is
and honestly im not very experienced about a lot of things
that isnt a bad thing
theres a first time for everything
i dont mean to be rude
but your hands seem awful bent
it must be quite painful
i dont really know what i have
i have some form of a disease
i have a lot of catching up to do
what kind of a disease
i was born old
thomas is quiet
and for many things
guileless no need to be
nothing wrong with old age
im sorry about your disease
my mother says were all born with something
thomas looks at him
they get their drinks
tap glasses and drink
benjamin coughs at the taste
but forces it down
and as they laugh at his discomfort
thomas and benjamin deep in conversation
and both of them more than a few sheets to the wind
benjamin particularly overblown like any first time drunk
my wife passed away many years ago
slurring im very sorry
she died in childbirth
and theres a moment when it seems like thomas might tell him but despite the alcohol he thinks better of it
toasts sadly to children
nods toasts to mothers and fathers
after some moments what line of work are you in mr
there isnt a button we dont make
our biggest competition is b
goodrich and his infernal zippers
the waiter comes over
would you gentlemen like another
one more benjamin
if youll let me pay for it mr
he takes out a little of his hard earned pay
proud of himself
what kind of work do you do
proud of himself im a tugboat man
the cars stopped outside the gate
benjamin is drunkenly getting out
i enjoyed talking to you
i enjoyed drinking with you
he starts to wobble inside
after him benjamin
would you mind if time to time i stopped by to say hello
a drunken wave anytime
happily goodnight benjamin
benjamin turns inside
thomas looks after him for a long moment
and then he drives away
benjamin holding the railing for support starts up the stairs for bed
where have you been
and we see queenie has been sitting in the front room
where she can see out the window
i listened to some music
i he doesnt mention the whore
but generically says
i met some people
and right on cue benjamin wobbles
i think mama
im going to
and to finish the evening he throws up
the familys on the lawn
i loved the weekends when she would come and spend the night with her grandmother
daisy nine now asleep in bed with grandma fuller
we see benjamin quietly enter
he gently nudges daisy awake
whispers do you want to see something
we have to keep it secret
daisy always willing always brave gets up
whispers get dressed
ill meet you behind the kitchen
and he leaves the room as quickly as he came
benjamin in an old peacoat holding another waits
daisy comes out
as he stops the door from slamming
whispers can you swim
i can do anything you can do
put this on
he gives her a heavy coat
she puts it on
its two sizes too big for her
we have to go fast
and she follows him between the houses
the two of them going quickly down the street
the first light of dawn
a full compliment of boats tied up for the night
they scamper along the dock
to the chelsea
benjamin helps her climb aboard
he goes downstairs to find captain mike sprawled across his bunk in all his naked tattooed glory an empty bottle on the floor
whats wrong with him
i think he has mejembe
shaking him captain mike
could you take us out
captain mike opens one eye
sees them standing there
you know what day it is
do you know what dat mean
it means i was very drunk last night
youre drunk every night
captain mike just squints
is that a girl
a close friend
i wanted to show her the river
im not supposed to be joy ridin with civilians
i could lose my license
that notion stops him for about a nanosecond
grabbing a bottle what you standin there for
the tugboat making its way through the fog
benjamin standing with daisy on the prow
the wind in their faces
and suddenly out of the fog a horn blares
as loud as anything they have ever heard
and moving out of the mist horn still echoing a huge ocean liner appears
with three other tugboats pushing it to sea
she put in for repair
a wounded duck
shes flyin now
captain mike joins the tugs at the liners side
the tugs sounding horns of their own
a symphony of a kind
what interests benjamin
what does it take to build something like that
passengers line the railing
continuing their adventure
and what interests daisy
imagine all the places theyre going to see
daisy thrilled waves to them the passengers along the rail waving back
benjamin stands by daisy their hair blowing in the salty air
to benjamin i wish we could go with them
as they watch the liner like a foggy dream sailing away
the rain and wind knocking at the window
murmurs i wish we could have
the morphine did you say something mother
and theres a hint of anxiety in caroline now
anxiety coupled with exhaustion
daisy doesnt say anything
caroline worriedly looks out the window
it seems to be getting worse
daisy doesnt respond
are you hearing me mother
look at that
time just seeped out of me
somebody will come and mop it up and that will be the end
caroline can only listen
she takes a deep breath gathering her strength
and when her mothers settled again
do you want me to go on reading
she murmurs hmmm
as if she didnt know caroline had stopped
caroline looks back down at the book
things were changing quickly
we see benjamins reflection in a mirror
we pull back to see were in his friends room
benjamin sitting in a straight back chair
getting a haircut
the dog at their feet
the victrola as usual is working overtime
i dont know how its possible you seem to have more hair
a little arrogant what if i was to tell you i wasnt getting older i was getting younger than everybody else
and she then says taking the wind out of his sails
well id feel very sorry for you
to have to see everybody you love die before you
hes quiet he hadnt thought of that
that would be an awful responsibility
i had never thought about life or death that way before
and seeing hes upset she says the most beautiful of things
were meant to lose the people we love
how else would we know how important they are to us
and one fall day
a familiar visitor came knocking on our door
we see benjamin knocking on the womans door
would you like to go for a walk
theres no response
he opens it going inside
the woman is sitting in a chair by the window the dog at her feet the familiar victrola playing dance music
he comes around the chair
and he sees shes still
her soul moved on
we see an old new orleans paupers cemetery
benjamin and the mourners and because he cant remember her name around an unmarked grave
she had taught me how to play the piano
as benjamin watches the woman go to her final rest
and she taught me what it meant to miss somebody
we see benjamin taking some things out of a dresser drawer packing a suitcase
i had gone to a whore house id had my first drink i had said goodbye to one friend and buried another
in when i was coming to end of the th year of my life i packed by bag
we see him putting some final things into the suitcase closing it
and said goodbye
we see benjamin moving through the parlor one by one saying his good byes to the old people
i knew life being what it was i would probably never see them again
the familiar faces
and as we watch him affectionately touch or talk to each of them
we can just see out a screen window daisy almost thirteen now leaning against the side of the house
out of sight
as if she didnt say goodbye he wouldnt leave
we see tizzy on the porch holding benjamins suitcase for him
the womans old dog lying beside him
shaking his hand good luck son
and we see queenie has come out onto the porch with her little girl
and he holds queenie
tears running down her face
he bends to pet the old dog goodbye
he takes up his suitcase and starts off the porch
going down the walkway
he hesitates and opens the gate
moving out onto the street
when suddenly daisy is calling him
she comes running
he stops to let her catch up to him
where are you going
ill send you a postcard
write me a postcard from everywhere
and with so much she wants to say she cant say anything
so she runs away
he watches her go watchers her thin legs running back down the street
and he turns and moves off along the street
and i went off to sea
we see him in the distance the old man a year old suitcase in hand going to find out who he is and what he is to become
caroline cant avoid the howling of the wind
concerned i think i should find out whats going on
stops her theres a box of them
in a velvet bag
caroline not sure what she wants opens a red velvet bag
she finds a wooden cigar box
is this what youre looking for
you said you wanted this
she gives her the box
daisy opens it
its filled with postcards
daisy going through them
can you imagine
he sent me postcards from everywhere he went
every place he worked
she takes one out reading it
taking up some others
reading where they came from
reading off like an adventure
daisy the postcards fond memories spread out on the bed around her
please keep reading sugar
caroline takes another look at the window then takes up the book
sitting back down i had gone
with captain mikes crew on the chelsea
the tugboat in the distance steaming through the ocean
captain mike had contracted for three years with moran brothers tug and salvage
the old ship had been refitted with a diesel engine and a new sea winch
we went around florida and up the atlantic seaboard
the refitted chelsea on the atlantic ocean
we were a crew of seven now
captain mike and me
prentiss mayes from wilmington delaware
and we see an old sea hand in his domain his galley smoking and coughing as he cooks
the brody twins
rick and vic
two burly hard working identical twin brothers
who got along fine at sea
but for some reason once they were on dry land
couldnt stand the sight of each other
the brothers getting off the tug
and no sooner have they hit dry land they immediately get into a fist fight
there was john grimm who fit his name
from belvedere south dakota
we see a dour looking man
who always expects the worst
you know one in every eight boats never returns all hands lost at sea
and pleasant curtis who never said a word to anyone
except to himself
the asocial pleasant
talking to himself as he works
benjamin standing on the bow of the old tug as it sloughs through a fog on the high seas
ready to see the world
daisy lying in bed
i wrote him constantly
told him everything i was doing
the tug on its way in for the night
benjamin sitting on a cleat reading her letter
i told him they had invited me to new york to audition for the school of american ballet
tilting from the grey sky onto an old landmark building
a large open dance loft
and we see daisy dancing for a selection committee seated on metal chairs
daisy moving with technical proficiency but its bloodless without any real distinction
she gets nods but no kudos
one of the corps
another dancing gypsy
we see daisy training
just another lithe body
daisy in bed
picking up another postcard she stops reading slowing at a painful memory
then he wrote me
ive met somebody
and ive fallen in love
and we see daisy sitting on the dance floor reading the very same postcard brokenhearted
the troupe moves into their places
daisy still just part of the crowd
the music starts
now as daisy dances
it is filled with pathos and lost love
and everyone takes notice
daisy reading the very postcard some sixty odd years later
as if reading it for the first time
ive met somebody
and ive fallen in love
my that was over
and realizing sixty years ago
shes quiet looking out the window
did you love him mother
what can a girl know about love
as she watches the rain on the window caroline takes it as her cue to keep reading
we were working in murmansk russia
daisy stares at the window the constant beating rain the water running down the window
murmansk is on the barrent sea the only ice free ocean port in the soviet union
we see chelsea working with other tugs as snow falls in the crowded russian harbor
they tow a large freighter into port
benjamin who is coiling rope on the bow stands and looks at the captain
squinting down at him wanting to know tell me hows it happen you showed up you were no bigger than a bollard
now either i drink a helluva lot more than i think i do or you sprouted
whats your secret
and benjamin tired of explanations and what comes first to mind
well captain you do drink a lot
and that makes perfect sense to mike
taking a drink saluting goddamn right i do
and benjamin stands on the bow
ready to see the world
we stayed at a small hotel with the grand name the winter palace
snow covers the street outside of a turn of the century hotel
a front window looks into its lobby
the winter palace hotel
theres a packed bar off the lobby
we see benjamin sitting with captain mike their crew and a mixture of other seamen russians and other ethnics all speaking different languages sitting and standing around tables cluttered with
bottles and glasses
captain mike drunk his shirt off is telling a russian sailor another interpreting for him about a tattoo he has over his heart
an upside down hummingbird
i saws this tattoo puts on a mans back in singapore by sakumoro the greatest tattoo artist ever lived
i puts it on myself from memry
and now we know why its upside down
this idnt just anoter bird
its heart rates twelve hunerd beats a minute
its wings beats eighty times a second
if you was to stop their wings from beatin they would be dyin in less than ten seconds
this is no ordinary bird this is a frikkin miracle
they slowed down the wings
wit movin pictures you know what it showed they wing tips are doin dis
and he draws on a napkin a figure eight
does you know what the figure eight is the mathematical symbol of
pointing at the symbol
and for some drunken reason no matter what language they might speak they all laugh
everybody no matter what differences they had the languages the color of their skin had one thing in common
they were drunk every single night
then theres a shout and as if to underscore things the brody twins are kicking the shit out of each other again
we see benjamin waiting for the small caged elevator to take him to his room
he gets in the elevator operator about to shut the grill door
would you wait please
and we see a woman in her late s
getting on the elevator
benjamin looks over at her
her name was elizabeth abbott
she was not beautiful
she was plain as paper
but she was as pretty as any picture to me
plain as paper elizabeth abbott
directly behind her walks a tall tired man in his s
by the look of his ruddy face and her silent mien
theyre both drunk
benjamin finds himself looking at her
what are you looking at
she has a distinctly english accent
benjamin doesnt say a word
if you must know we have a long standing agreement never to go to bed sober
isnt that right darling
her husband was walter abbott
he was chief minister of the british trade mission in murmansk
and he was a spy
they ride up
elizabeth has her shoes off
she sees him noting her stocking feet
the elevator finally rattles to a stop and george and elizabeth get off
starting down the hall
she abruptly turns to say to benjamin
so that its completely understood
i broke the heel off of one of my shoes
i dont usually walk around in my bare feet
and as he watches her saunter along the hallway
the way drunks do
endeavoring to keep her dignity
they were long days there
benjamin on the tug but its less fun now not much adventure just hard work
fighting the snow and the wind they tow a large freighter into port
benjamin in his small room cold air blasting through the windows looking out the window into the snowy night
and longer nights
he lays on his bed looking out at the dark sky
the snow falling
one particular night
when i was having trouble sleeping
benjamin trudges down the stairs stepping tentatively into the empty lobby
he slows seeing elizabeth abbott in her bathrobe sitting alone and lonely
and its not the first time for her
i cant sleep
she finally looks up
but doesnt say anything
theres an awkward moment
exacerbated by the stillness of the hotel in the middle of the night
i was going to make some tea
would you like some
she shakes her head no
he crosses through the empty bar into an old kitchen
he looks for tea
puts water in a kettle
as he watches the kettle boil
elizabeth her arms folded across her chest as if she were chilled stands by the door
benjamin without asking takes a cup for her
some honey thank you
he finds a large honey jar
and seeing some dead flies in with the sweet syrup he asks
do you like flies with your tea
for the first time
a thin smile
he starts to stir the tea
elizabeth stopping him
you must let it steep for a minute
theres a proper way to make tea
where im from they just want it to be hot
she doesnt smile
he gives her a cup of tea
she cradles the cup
theyre quiet drinking their tea
after some moments
youre a seaman
i dont mean to be rude
but arent you rather old to be working on a boat
theres no age limit
as long as you can do the work
theyre quiet again
she sits at an old wood counter
you have trouble sleeping
its an invitation to sit with her
he pulls a stool over sitting across from her
i didnt know i did
i usually sleep like a baby
something kept me up
i never sleep
well rarely anyway
he doesnt say anything
my father when he was in his eighties was so sure he was going to die in his sleep
he would only take naps during the afternoon
so that death couldnt catch him
did he what
die in his sleep
he died sitting in his favorite chair listening to his favorite program on the radio
smiles he must have known something
she smiles at the idea
that goes as quickly as its come
and its quiet again
my husbands the british trade minister
weve been here fourteen months
we were supposed to be going to peking
but it just never did work out
it never does seem to work out
have you been to the far east
i havent really been anywhere
i mean outside different harbors
where are you from
new orleans louisiana
pure elizabeth i didnt know there was another one
which escapes him
ive never been to america
but not america
am i missing anything
simply guileless the mississippi river
and she told me all the places she had been and what she had seen
i can tell you what bars look like in places all over the world
and we talked until just before the dawn
the first hint of daylight
thank you for the tea
she leaves as quietly as she entered
benjamin remains standing for a moment
then shuts the light off behind him
and we went back to our rooms
to our separate lives
and as he goes back up the quiet stairs
and every night
we would meet in the middle of the night
benjamin padding downstairs
happy to see elizabeth in her bathrobe sitting in the empty lobby waiting for him
elizabeth and benjamin quietly talking
a hotel in the middle of the night can be a magical place
and we see the empty front desk and tiny silver bell
the vacant lobby with its musty old rugs
the open elevator waiting
the dining room with its crisp white tablecloths
a mouse stopping and running and stopping
a mouse crossing the lobby floor doing just that
a radiator hissing
a sink dripping
a floor creaking
a curtain blowing
we see and hear it all
all the little sounds a symphony that make up life in a hotel in the middle of the night
benjamin and elizabeth sitting quietly drinking their tea
there is something peaceful even comforting knowing that people you love are asleep in their beds where nothing can harm them
queenie and tizzy asleep together in her bed
their child on the floor
the old people in their beds in the old house
ngunda oti asleep in a room somewhere
the unnamed womans grave
a different kind of sleep
and of course daisy in a new york apartment loft with other dancers
elizabeth and i would talk through the night until just before dawn
daylight starts to creep in
she gets up about to go
i may have given you the wrong impression
the wrong impression
you must think i dont love my husband
why do you say that
married women dont usually sit with strange men in a hotel in the middle of the night
i certainly dont
honestly i dont know what married women do or dont do
lets get one thing straight
i love him very much
i happen to think he is one of the smartest and most considerate men i ever met
it is not his fault i decided to spend my life in his shadow
and with that she gets up and leaves
benjamin left with that thought
benjamin and elizabeth in the empty dining room at a table with a white tablecloth
with some wine and cheese
shes laughing now measurably loosened up
he started to take his pants off
im afraid he misread me completely
she looks through her wine glass at him
do you notice how people look better through a wine glass
he holds his up
looking at her
she moves her glass just looking at him
youre a good looking man with or without a wine glass
she picks at the tablecloth with her finger next to his
she puts her finger over his making a cross
we are all just crossing in the night
sometimes we intersect
she leaves her finger there for a moment
she abruptly moves it away
i should go to bed
hell be up soon
and she kisses him and then hurries out of the dining room
as benjamin sits in the empty dining room
the kiss left on his lips
it was the first time a woman had ever kissed me
its something you never forget
the wind and rain knocking at the window
daisy silently lying in bed
are you upset mother
she doesnt say anything
caroline seeing her feet have come out of the covers caring fixes her blanket
would you like some socks
do you want me to stop reading
daisys answer for her is
it must have been very cold
im glad he had somebody to keep him warm
which caroline takes as her cue to read on
after a beat reading i couldnt wait to see her again
benjamin comes hurrying down the stairs
elizabeth is waiting as she normally is but this time she is dressed
lipstick and hair done
wearing a fur
self conscious im not dressed youre delicious just as you are
she laughs taking his arm walking to the dining room as if going to dinner
they sit at a table
which she has set for them
caviar and vodka
dont bother with the cheese or the wine here theyre quite common
but the caviar and the vodka are plentiful and sublime
she feeds him a spoonful of the caviar
unaccustomed to it he swallows it too quickly
take your time
if you eat it all at once there will be nothing left to enjoy
she gives him another spoonful
and takes one herself
he takes his time
they both do
pouring now a swallow of vodka
which they do
looking at him
you havent been with many women have you
at least none on a sunday
smiles i feel like im with a virgin
shes not far off
and its a lovely thought
and it makes her think of her youth
when i was nineteen i tried to become the first woman to swim the english channel
and we see just that
young elizabeth in goggles her body covered with grease swimming with two escort boats across the english channel
the current was so strong
that for every stroke i took
i was pushed two strokes back
and we see just that elizabeth fighting the current
i swam for hours
i was only two miles from the french shore
elizabeth in sight of the lights of calais
when it started to rain
and it starts to rain on her
harder and harder
the shore is suddenly gone from sight
when i couldnt go any further and i just stopped
and we see her being taken onto a boat a blanket wrapped around her
they asked me whether i would try again
why wouldnt i
she smiles a young girl full of life
i never did
as a matter of fact i have never done much of anything with my life after that
and its quiet
she touches his rough hand
your hands are very rough
you have grease under your nails
she runs her fingernail along his face
i can feel the wind on your face
they look at each other
and this time benjamin kisses her
she stops herself
im afraid its the witching hour
she quickly gets up
and shes gone
as benjamin sits in the empty dining room
it took me a long time to go to sleep
we see elizabeth nicely dressed a bottle of champagne in her hand sitting anxiously waiting
the elevator doors open
benjamin in a suit and tie as handsome as weve seen him steps out
she stands takes his arm
do i look okay
i borrowed it from one of the men
its his church suit
you take my breath away
she walks with him champagne bottle in hand through the empty lobby
the thing about clothing is it should make you feel comfortable then you will be comfortable
come lets take a walk
their arms in each others their breath showing in the night they walk through the sleeping russian town their shadows in the moonlight
they stop to share a drink from the champagne bottle
i feel so much younger when im with you
and it seems hes about to go on
but elizabeth flattered takes it metaphorically
thats such a nice thing to say
you make me feel years younger too
i wish i was
i would change so many things
i would undo all of my mistakes
i kept waiting thinking i would do something to change my circumstance
but i never did
its an awful waste you can never get it back
she looks at him
abruptly if were going to have an affair youre never to look at me during the day we must always part by sunrise and we can never say i love
and when it is over i will send you a card that will simply say goodbye
those are the rules
they stand in the cold
his answer is
are you as cold as i am
laughs my god colder
they stop to finish whats left of the champagne elizabeth hurling the bottle
the bottle falling silently into some fresh snow
you cant even break a bottle here
they look at each other and they kiss
and without anything else needing to be said they start back
get a key
benjamin goes behind the registration desk taking an empty room key off a hook
they cross to the elevator
they stand in the elevator as it ascends
anticipating whats to come
they move along a dark hallway
he quietly unlocks an empty room door
and as he follows her into the room
the door closing
she was the first woman who ever loved me
benjamin in his peacoat and stocking cap snow on him hurries into the hotel from work
he runs to the elevator the doors just closing
he goes inside
and elizabeths husband is standing in the elevator
they silently ride up not a word exchanged
the elevator stops
elizabeths husband gets out
as he quietly walks down the hall
we saw each other every night
we always used the same room
we see the key going into the door
benjamin and elizabeth going inside closing the door behind them
leaving us with the quiet hallway
but each time seemed new and different
and we see them as dawn creeps along the hallway benjamin and elizabeth leaving the room not wanting to part passionately kissing and as they start to go their separate
whispers you should swim the english channel again
and as she laughs to herself and hurries off
until one night
we see benjamin coming down the stairs into the lobby to meet elizabeth
and he slows
elizabeth isnt there
he looks into the bar
the dining room
he goes back to the lobby sitting on a lone sofa waiting for her
a mouse runs across the marble floor stops looks at him and runs off
and he sits and waits
snow shrouds the windows
we see benjamin has fallen asleep on the sofa
theres the distinctive bellow of captain mikes voice
he follows the bellowing to find captain mike with the tugboat crew in the bar
roosevelt says we all got to do our part
after them japs attacked pearl harbor everyones got to
the chelseas been commissioned to serve in the united states navy to repair tow salvage and rescue
anybody dont want to go to war nows the time to say so
once you set foot on that boat again youre in the navy friend
right away ill go captain
easy old timer
to the men ill hold it against no man
but speak up now or forever hold your water
and the cook prentis mayes
i was planning on talking to you capn mike
my wifes doing poorly
id like to see her one more time
understanding youre free to get home any way you can mr
and the cook walks off
always dour who do you intend to have cook then
one of the leading causes of death at sea is food poisoning right after inadequate safety equipment
i grew up cooking sir
ill take the job if im not too old to serve
you a real johnny on the spot benjamin
ill take any able bodied mens who wants kick shit out of the japs and the huns
and with no one dissenting
then thats it
wes goin to war gentlemen
and filled with fervor they give a cheer
benjamin unlocking the door to his room
an envelope has been left under the door he opens it
she had left a note
she wrote it was nice to have met you
that was it
and as he stands holding the letter in his room at the small russian hotel and so i went to war
the men on the tug on a dark gray sea
it wasnt the war we expected
we would tow crippled ships
scraps of metal
across the high seas
if there was a war we didnt see it
and what seemed exciting the idea of war
the chelsea towing a strange hulking shape on the dark empty sea
there was a man assigned with us
the chief gunner loved the navy and most of all he loved america
there is no other country in the world
when you spell america a
youre spelling freedom
we see the young gunnery mate no more than nineteen
sitting at his post on a high caliber machine gun
ready to kick some enemy ass
his name was dennis smith and he was a full blooded cherokee
his family had been in america for over five hundred years
you have these pacifists
they say they wont fight on conscience
where would we be if everybody decided to act according to their conscience
out his window keeps it down would you chief
he goes back inside
and as they settle into their tasks
on his gun to himself the last word where else can you shoot white people and get away with it
benjamins the only one around to hear him
i worked in the kitchen
benjamin busy preparing a meal in the galley kitchen
the perpetually silent pleasant curtis on kitchen duty helping him with the preparation
while they work
trying to make conversation youre from the kentucky mountains arent you
it must be pretty there
pleasant curtis doesnt say a word
benjamin shrugging puts the pie in an oven
the men including dennis smith pleasant curtis john grimm the fighting brody twins benjamin serving them silently eating dinner rolling with endless rolling ocean
pleasant not interested just gets up and leaves
theres something not normal about him
as they silently eat mostly bored
looking outside whoever said war is hell doesnt know shit from shinola
we see chelsea a steel tow line splayed out from its winch towing a large crippled freighter across the ocean
we were towing a british freighter that had gone dead in the water miles to halifax for repair
we see benjamin and the crew watching the ship on the tow line run out some thousand feet behind them
we see benjamin awake in his bunk dennis smith asleep in the bunk above him
pleasant curtis seemingly asleep in his bunk below him
benjamin looking out at the black sea
and out of the silence pleasant curtis for the first time speaks
ive been watching you
you seem trustworthy
if something happens to me
could you see this gets to my wife
he hands benjamin a folded up handkerchief
he had given me all of his pay
he hadnt spent a dime of it
if anything happens i want my family to know i was thinking about them and if i could have id have come back home
and that said he turns back over
and as benjamin looks at the dark foreboding sea
suddenly calls all hands on deck
they bolt from their bunks
captain mike stands by the wheelhouse
silently looking at the ocean
they see bodies of men dead men floating by them
one and two at first
then three and four
and then more and more until they are moving through a carpet of bodies
the war found us
as they move through the water
their propeller literally chopping up bodies to where they have to veritably shut their engines down
a transport carrying men had been hit by a torpedo
we were first to arrive at the scene
and as the tug arrives at the scene we see a transport vessel with a gaping hole in its midships sinking quickly
fuel oil burning on the water
its then we see the true horror of the men in the water
in the burning black oil
the transport boat silently slips into the water disappearing under the sea
as the tug moves through the thick black smoke
benjamin and the other crewmen watching along the rails
there wasnt a sound
except for the lapping of water and the tugboats engines there isnt
just the silence of death
something else appears doming onto the surface like a spectre
the u boat that had reeked this havoc
looking to see the results
captain mike sees the sub
mad as hell we cant run from the fucker and we cant hide
theres only one thing we can do
and he shouts battle stations
they run to their battle stations
captain mike at the wheel in the pilot house turning the tug furiously bearing down on the surfaced submarine
a german submariner on the conning tower seeing the tugboat turns the
caliber machine gun on the tugboat
benjamin is grazed by a bullet his forehead cut open bleeding
despite the strafing the tug is relentless
the submarine seeing it is about to be rammed tries to dive
but its too late
the tugboat ramming the submarine
severing the u boat in half
the concussion of the collision has triggered a torpedo in the sinking submarines torpedo shaft the torpedo exploding bursting the submarine and in the process blasting away under the stern
of the tugboat
the men on the stern blown to pieces
benjamins literally thrown against the wheel house
he manages to get to his feet the tug listing beginning to sink
theres a mans voice
and he sees captain mike riddled with bullets his body covered with blood
benjamin bends to him
captain mike trembling as he lays dying
look at what they did
they shot holes in me
they shots the hell out my paintin
his body his tattoos like a ripped canvas is riddled
youve seen a lot of things
tell me its going to be alright
youre going to heaven captain mike
youre going to heaven
benjamin sits beside him his friend captain mike dying
and a light comes in captain mikes eyes
you can be mad as a mad dawg at the way things wents
you can swear curse the fates regret everyting you ever dids
but when it comes to the end
you have to lets go
he looks in benjamins old eyes
give me a hand old man
and as he holds benjamins hand ready to meet his maker
there are two destroyers and a hospital ship in the battle zone flow
the water still speckled with debris and bodies
we see benjamin at the railing of a liberty ship
he watches the chelsea sink disappearing under the sea
men died that day
i said my goodbyes to the cherokee dennis smith john grimm who was right he was going to die there
i sent pleasant curtis wife his money
i said goodbye to the twin vic brody
he instinctively turns and sees rick brody looking out a porthole lost without his twin brother
and to mike clark
captain of the tugboat chelsea
a storage cabinet is opened a sailor taking out a wreath from a supply of just such wreaths
the sailor shrugs giving him the wreath
i said goodbye to all the other men
who had dreams of their own
all the men who wanted to be plumbers or singers or insurance salesmen or doctors
or lawyers or indian chiefs
and suddenly angrily he throws the wreath into the water
out here death didnt seem normal
benjamin standing at the rail of the ship
no longer a boy
and a sailor standing beside him
this dont get fixed
when suddenly a hummingbird comes flying across the water
it circles the wreath the way hummingbirds do
and then flies off
id never seen a hummingbird that far out to sea before
and as benjamin stands at the railing looking at the sea
in the spring of
when i was years old
i went home
we see benjamin suitcase in hand going up the walk to the old house
were struck by the difference
the old man who had left to see the world has returned a strikingly handsome man in his fifties
the old blind dog smelling ham ambles off the porch to meet him
nothing seems to have changed
an old woman we dont know is rocking on the porch
a black girl just
is hanging out wash
is your mother home
shes gettin supper ready
he goes up the porch inside
some old folks are in the front room
nobody we know
he moves by them into the kitchen
the stovetop smoking and gurgling
he goes into the dining room
queenie is busy setting the table
he watches her for a moment
she turns seeing him
she drops a plate
lord have mercy
she runs to embrace him
we see shes aged
the eight years hes been gone
and the years or so since weve known her
now in her fifties
asks who is that mama
the girl comes inside
your brother benjamin
i didnt know he was my brother
laughs theres a shit load of things you dont know
but her interest is in benjamin
studying him you look like youve been born again
youre younger than the springtime
i think that preacher laid the hands on you brought you a second life
i knew the moment i saw you you were special
every night i got on my knees asking the good lord to bring you back safely
remember what i told you
you never know whats comin for you
and they both share a good laugh at her homily
glad to be together once again
did you learn anything worth repeating
i saw a lot of things
she touches the scar from the bullet on his forehead
you seen some pain
some joy too
he nods that too
and she holds him again
weathers died in his sleep one night last april
hes sleeping comfortably now in the cemetery on st
james street god rest his soul
im so sorry
she turns from him so as not to cry
theres only one or two of them left now
they all just about new
waitin their turn like everybody else
i am so glad to have i you back
now we got to find you some proper work and get you married right
and as she goes about readying the table for dinner humming to herself
benjamin sitting with a row of oldsters
and feeling out of place out of time he gets up and goes inside
we see benjamin playing the piano in the parlor the particular tune the woman had taught him
an old man sitting nearby seemingly listening
queenie looking in
youre wasting your time
hes stone deaf
youll be staying in what was mrs
deserouxs room now youre too much of a man to stay in the attic anymore
she goes about her business
and as benjamin goes back to playing the piano for the deaf man
playing for himself
we see mr
daws much older now asleep in an easy chair
benjamin standing at the familiar window listening to the silence of the house
its a funny thing about coming home
smells the same
looks the same
feels the same
as if he never left
did i ever tell you ive been struck by lightning seven times
once i was sitting in my truck listening to the radio
and we see just that mr
daws sitting in his truck getting belted by lightning
you realize whats changed is you
while benjamin stands locking out the window and one evening not long after i had been back
we see benjamin coming down the stairs
he happens to glance out a casement window
he can just see part of a taxi coming to stop at the gate
he moves to the next landing
where he can see a figure is getting out of the cab
the figure of a young woman wearing a beret a dark coat and lace up boots
she strides through the gate
it takes us a moment to recognize her
the leggy thirteen year old girl is gone
replaced by a confident woman in her early twenties
with her red hair and her blue eyes she could be no one else but daisy
benjamin follows her progress moving through the parlor watching her out the screened windows
she moves gracefully past the porch with its swings
the unnamed womans old dog smelling her comes to greet her
daisy going around to the back of the house
benjamin moving to the back door and just as daisy starts to knock
benjamin opening it
momentarily startled she doesnt recognize him
oh excuse me
is queenie here
its me benjamin
she hardly can believe her eyes
oh my god its you
of course its you
they embrace and theres a moment when the touch is not just of old friends but something different
and they both in that moment recognize that things will never be the same
daisy over hugging him
the way young people do
benjamin how are you
its been such a long time
theres so much i want to know
when did you come back
just a few weeks ago
i spoke to queenie
she told me you were in the war
somewhere at sea
i was so worried about you
simply im okay
when i had left she was a girl
and a woman had taken her place
i cant get over you you are so lovely
you stopped writing
i feel terrible about it
now that i see you i feel even worse
look at you
she touches her old face
he said the most beautiful mother
what else did he say about
everything in that moment had changed between us
benjamin and daisy going up the back stairs
i cant get over youre home
ive been planning to come by for awhile
my grandmother you remember grandma fuller
of course you remember her
she passed away
i heard that
ive been wanting to get some of her things
they go into her grandmothers room
her grandmothers things are in boxes neatly stacked in a corner waiting to be taken away
daisy starts to go through them
benjamin gives her a hand
as they go through things
i cant believe i open the door and youre actually standing there
it must be fate
what do they call it kismet
i read a book about a man named edgar cayce a psychic everything is predetermined
i like to think its fate
what do you think benjamin
i dont know how it works but im sure glad it happened
they inadvertently touch
the electricity of friction
both aware of the closeness
they move ever so slightly apart
nervously have you been to new york
its just across the bridge from me
i can actually see the empire state building if i stand on my bed
where have you been
tell me everything
the last time you wrote you said you were in russia
i always wanted to go to russia
is it as cold as they say
you wrote you met somebody
did it work out
holding out remember this
hes comes upon the book her grandmother had read to them rudyard kiplings just so
she sits on the bed
benjamin sitting beside her
the two shoulder to shoulder
daisy looking through the book
this is the picture of old man kangaroo at five in the afternoon
she looks at him
you dont look like an old man anymore
you always said you were different
i think you must be
he doesnt say anything
the two of them sitting with their backs to us like the old friends they are
acutely aware of their proximity and before it can go any further
are you hungry
would you like to get something to eat
i would love that
and the moments gone
and we see a taxi door being opened in slow motion
and daisy dressed for the night glides out
a man helping her
and we see benjamin a step behind getting out of the car
dressed to the nines
hair slicked elegant
but nonetheless a step behind
and we hear daisys voice from somewhere else
i danced for a man named ballenchine
hes a famous choreographer
he said i had a perfect line
they asked ballenchine to describe what he did
he said im a carpenter
isnt that amazing
in one of his rehearsals a dancer fell
he put it into the production
can you imagine that in a classical ballet
a dancer intentionally falling
he isnt the only one agnes demille lincoln kirstein richard pleasant lucia chase
theres a whole new word for dance now its called abstract
the door to the restaurant held open for daisy
another man showing her inside
benjamin forgotten for the slightest of moments at the door
going after her
a crowded new orleans restaurant
daisy as a maitre d in slow motion is showing her to a table
mens and even womens eyes following her
they have torn up all the conventions
the straight up and down style all the things that bound dancers
its not about the formality of the dance
the classical structure
its about what the dancers feeling
there are no rules the movement can be tense or relaxed abrupt or flowing carefree or somber it may suggest love or hate attraction or repulsion
the unexpected shifts of weight or energy not just to shock but to reinvent tradition
putting the familiar form to new and unexpected uses
its so basic just you alone with your body
they reach a table
a chair in slow motion swept out for her to sit
another man in slow motion putting a napkin in her lap
they understand americas vigor and physicality they understand the freshness of the american people at their most modern at their best
and she told me about this world that she was so attracted to
names that didnt mean a thing to me
i didnt really hear very much of what she was saying
we watch them at the table
benjamin listening appreciating her
her face aglow with the intensity and the passion of youth
caviar is brought over
she screws up her mouth not wanting to eat
we can sense hes telling her what hes learned from elizabeth abbott how to savor it
he feeds her a spoonful
they drink the vodka washing it down
she laughs delighted
and we now hear what she is saying
realizing oh my god ive been just talking about myself
im enjoying listening
she takes out a cigarette
he instinctively looks for matches a man gets there first lighting her cigarette for her
he watches the smoke curl around her
i didnt know you smoked
im old enough
i m old enough for a lot of things
yes you are
we see benjamin and daisy their silhouettes walking through the park
she puts her arm around his shoulder
being close to him
i have to go back tomorrow
i wish i could stay
they reach a gazebo
not a soul around
they stand for a moment in the silence
in new york we stay up all night
i eat breakfast in a diner on houston with red booths and watch the sun come up over the buildings
theres always something to do
which is in stark contrast to benjamins life
daisy takes off her shoes
dont need costumes or scenery
and showing him what shes been telling him about she does a dance for him
i could imagine dancing completely naked
daisy dancing for him
while she dances
have you read d
lawrence his books were banned
the words are like making love
he stands hands in his pockets appreciating her
she moves closer to him
she comes next to him and she kisses him
and when he doesnt respond
she tries a different tact
in our group
you have to trust people
not be afraid
is a big part of it
a lot of the dancers
a woman wanted me to sleep with her
does that upset you
that someone wanted to sleep with me
people should want to sleep with you
youre very desirable
lets go back to the house
or get a room somewhere
we can put down your coat
she takes his hand as if to lead him to the dark of the park
theres nothing hed like more
its not that i dont want to
i just cant
its just not
im old enough
and despite how available she is how desirable she is
go back to new york daisy
be with the people you are so fond of
you can only be young once
do you think you are too old for me
ive been with older men
and when he still doesnt respond
daisy rejected takes up her shoes
and she starts off
benjamin coming beside her
but theyre not really walking together anymore
and the time for them this time has gone away
you only get so many chances to be with someone
i let her go
and i missed it
daisy caught in the distant time
you look so handsome in that suit
a nurse looks in
theyre sayin the hurricanes going to miss us
blow right on by
oh thats great
the nurse goes off down the hall her voice telling people the good news
isnt that good news mother
but daisy is in still another place and another time
it is going to miss us
ill just stay under the blankets with my mother
she said nothing would happen to me
she looks at the book
would you like me to keep reading
after a beat he said things were becoming different for me
benjamin lying on his bed his glasses on reading
we see hes squinting
we see his point of view the print is blurred
he takes off the glasses looks at the print
and its clear as a bell
i didnt need glasses anymore
and we see benjamin naked standing in front of a full length mirror looking at himself studying himself
my hair had very little gray and grew like weeds
my sense of smell was keener
my hearing more acute
i could walk further and faster
he can see outside an ambulance has arrived
to take away another of the old people
while everybody else was aging
i was getting younger
and as he quietly looks at himself
theres a knock on the door
he puts something on and opens the door
and as if to underscore what hes just said he sees thomas button in his fifties himself now leaning on crutches his feet bandaged standing in the doorway
do you remember me
of course mr
what happened to you
my foot was infected
im afraid they had to remove it
beat without irony welcome home my friend
the bar and restaurant crowded with men many with various kinds of handicaps from the war drinking away their demons
and we see benjamin and thomas sitting at a table
thick steaks baked potatoes drinks at their elbows
youre still drinking sazerac with whiskey instead of brandy
im a man of habit
smiles are you still visiting the house on bourbon street
smiles not for a long time
i told him about my life
about my time at war
and he told me how he had devoted his business to making buttons for the war effort
the war has been kind to the button industry
we had gone from making forty thousand buttons a day to making two hundred and fifty thousand
we employed ten times the number of workers
we were operating around the clock
and he quiets
the sound of the busy restaurant
and after some moments thomas tells him
i dont know how much longer i have to live
im sorry to hear that mr
and it seems like he is about to tell benjamin the entire truth
but he cant bring himself and instead
i dont have any people
i keep to myself
i im frightened
i hope you wont mind
but whenever its possible
i would enjoy your company
ill do what i can mr
they quietly eat
after a beat tell me benjamin do you know anything about buttons
just what holds my shirt on
an old brick building with a painting on its side of a woman sewing on a button
a driver waits outside of a town car
we see thomas unlocking a door
has been telling him comes from the french bouton meaning a bud or any round object
they come into a corridor
thomas unlocking another door
they were originally decorative jewelry sewn on clothing
they walk through the quiet factory
the practice of buttoning originated in the th century
when baggy clothing was replaced with more form fitting clothes
thomas on his crutches
past the lines of work benches
mannequins in uniforms of the armed services
with their various gold and silver buttons
buttons buttons has been in our family for one hundred and twenty four years
my grandfather was a tailor
he had a small shop in richmond
after the civil war he came to new orleans
my father saw the wisdom of making our own buttons
the tailor shop grew to this
a smile i cant sew a stitch
benjamin is interested but the obvious question is
its all very interesting
but what do you want from me
i said our family has been in the business for a hundred and twenty four years
and its as if he has opened a flood gate
you are my family
benjamin you are my son
and tears run down his anguished face
i am so sorry not to have told you before
benjamin hasnt moved
the words ring in his ears
you were born the night the great war ended
your mother died giving birth to you
i thought you were a monster
i left you on the back steps of a house
i promised your mother id make sure you were safe
i should never have abandoned you
benjamins dead quiet
he looks at this man his father
we see benjamin and thomas in a hallway leading to the kitchen of the large house
the hallway filled with photographs of the button family
thomas pointing out relatives
a great uncle from germany
and a group picture all of the men in the family at the lake house
notices the date on it three years before you were born
a photograph of an old man sitting in a wooden deck chair on the dock of a lake
your grandfather at the summer house on lake pontchartrain
when i was a boy i would love to wake up before anybody else and run down to the lake to watch the day begin
it was as if i was the only one alive
and theyve come to a young womans photograph
who could only be benjamins mother
i fell in love with her the first time i saw her
beat your mothers name was caroline murphy
she worked in your grandfathers kitchen
she was from dublin
her father your maternal grandfather was a chimney sweep
he died in the flu epidemic of
caroline came with her mother two sisters and four brothers in to live in new orleans
they stop at the kitchen door
i would find reasons to go to the kitchen
just to look at her
he does just that
looking through the round window into the empty kitchen
as if she was there those years ago
as if she was still there
the happiest day of my life was april th the day i married your mother
they move along the hallway
benjamin looking at the photographs
after some moments why didnt you tell me
i made a mistake
benjamin looks at him
come and take your rightful place
with your family
when benjamin doesnt say anything
we can catch up for all the lost time
and when he still doesnt answer
im planning on leaving everything i have to you
his bribe strikes a nerve
i better go
where are you going
benjamin turns his back and walks out
benjamin standing by the door queenie sitting up in her bed
unforgiving angrily hes what
all those years hes creeping around here and never tells us who he is
i thought he was just queer or somethin comin around here
always askin for you
he left us that night you was found
eighteen ratty ass dollars and a dirty diaper
now he wants to be your father
he wants you to sit at his side
he wants your forgiveness
i wont ever forgive him for any of it
gods the only one that can forgive him
finished now i got to get up early with mrs
or she gonna drown
but not finished he thinks he can just show up and everything gonna be fine and dandy everybody gonna be friends
he got another thing coming
and with that she turns over to go back to sleep benjamin quietly leaves the room
he climbs the back stairs to his room as if hes carrying a terrible burden
as he comes onto the hallway mr
daws is sitting on a bench in the hall
did i ever tell you i was struck by lightning seven different times
once i was walking my dog along a country road
and we see just that when suddenly hes struck by lightning
the dog unharmed licking his face
im blind in the one eye
i cant hardly hear
i get twitches and shakes out of nowhere
i lose my line of thought
but you know what
god for some reason keeps on sending me a wake up
its his way of reminding me im lucky to be alive
a beat sniffs the air storms comin
and gets up and pads off into his room
benjamin left in the hallway
he goes over to look out the window like the boy we remember looking out at the street lights
we see benjamin being let in by a butler into the fashionable home
benjamin in the dark hallway quietly walking among the photographs of his family
he goes up the staircase
he goes to his fathers room
he quietly opens the door
the rooms dark his father asleep
he goes to his fathers bed
his fathers frail figure
we see benjamin wheeling his father in a wheelchair out of the house
the endless lake
and we see mr
buttons chauffeured car driving along the lake
the cars stopped at a chain across the driveway of an old summer home
benjamin helps to put thomas into his wheelchair
he wheels him up the long drive to the house
all closed up
there are steps that lead down to the lake
he starts to wheel his father down the steps
the steps are too steep for the wheelchair
benjamin reaches picking his father up out of the chair
he carries him down the steps but that too is arduous
and he puts his father on his back
his father holding onto his son as benjamin carries him on his back down the steps to the dock
theres an old wooden deck chair
he helps his father sit in the chair
and as his father sits for the last time watching the lake
thank you benjamin
benjamin sitting at a distance behind him
both of them watching the day begin
you can be mad as a mad dog at the way things went
you can swear curse the fates regret everything you ever did
but when it comes to the end
you have to let go
and as his father shuts his eyes sitting in the sun
i buried him in the button family plot
we see benjamin standing at his fathers gravesite in the family plot with ornate headstones
i had a tailor sew onto his best coat a button for every year of his life
fifty five of them
all different pearl and silver brass and wood
in case he lost one along the way
and as he stands at the gravesite
he hears something
queenie has come to be with him
to comfort him
why shes here dont you suffer alone for it
she takes his arm always there for him
looking around its a beautiful cemetery
and buried here right next to your mother
looks at her his wife
and as they stand at the gravesite
i went to pay a visit to the button factory
we see benjamin with an elderly woman ms
sanderson standing at the railing of a mezzanine above the factory work floor
looking down upon the workers exclusively women and exclusively white women making buttons
the women seeing him look up and theres a sudden hush
my name is benjamin benjamin
for the first time button
they stare up at him
as you know my father
it still sounds strange to him
my father thomas button
after a moment he asked that i take over the day to day operation of buttons buttons
they silently stare up at him
well i dont know the first thing about buttons
and i dont know a thing about business
after a beat buttons buttons has been in my fathers family for over years
it could not have survived without people like you
my father asked me to tell you how much he appreciated the hard work you put in for him and his company for so many years
and after a moment i have decided that all of you his loyal employees will have a share depending on your length of employment in the ownership of this factory
were the owners now
thats about it
theyre literally dumbfounded
sanderson will explain how everything works and will answer any of your questions
and with that he turns walking away
having given away the store
the workers in disbelief looking up at him
and i went to new york
we see a cab pull up and benjamin in a nice suit flowers in hand daisies gets out hurrying into the majestic theater the marquee telling us carousel is performing
benjamin coming in late being shown to his seat
and we see the production of rodgers and hammersteins musical carousel with mielziners seminal stage design as choreographed by agnes de mille
and we see the dancer is daisy
dancing with the man of her dreams the bad boy carnival barker
while benjamin watches her
we see benjamin flowers in hand making his way through a crowded backstage corridor filled with friends and well wishers giving cast members congratulations
he comes to the door
to the attention of a stagehand
im a friend of daisys
the man matter of factly opens the door
a dressing room crowded with dancers changing out of their costumes
he calls out
daisy has company
we can hear daisys name being said
he sees daisy in a robe coming through the room
somebodys looking for me
and she sees its benjamin
and rather than excited to see him
shes startled hes there
and not altogether pleased about him showing up
what are you doing here
and he realizes as most of us have in one love affair or another whatever his expectations may have been his fantasy is not the reality
i thought id come visit
spend some time with you if i could
i wish you would have called
you caught me by surprise
he gives her the flowers the daisies
i couldnt take my eyes off of you
you were mesmerizing
thats so nice of you to say
these are lovely
theres an awkward moment
i better get changed
a group of us are going to a party
would you like to come
somebody told me about a restaurant i thought you might enjoy
i made a reservation
just in case awkwardly all the dancers go out together after the show
youre welcome to come with us
therell be all sorts of interesting people
let me get changed
and she runs back inside the dressing room
benjamin left to stand in the hallway
a loft elevator opens depositing benjamin and daisy along with a bunch of people into a large loft
crowded with her friends dancers and show people musicians predominantly young people straight and gay beatniks before there were beatniks bohemians
people pressed together having to shout to talk
and i met her friends
ill get you a drink
as she turns to a kitchen to get him a drink she is startled as a young man david suddenly grabs her kissing her a kiss thats not intended to
daisy obviously involved with him
but embarrassed by the intimacy in front of benjamin and not wanting to hurt his feelings
she pulls awkwardly away from him
this is my friend david
david dances with our company too
this is the man ive told you about benjamin
they shake hands
daisy wanting to escape
ill get you that drink
she goes into the kitchen
you were her grandmothers friend or something like that
something like that
and daisy comes back out with a drink for him
and one of her own
but before she can give him his drink a woman takes it from her
and starts to dance with her
but not with her
the way dancers do
and many of the dancers are dancing just because they feel like it
david comes to dance with daisy
benjamin standing watching daisy dancing with him
as only dancers can
in complete control of their bodies and yet totally uninhibited
benjamin sees david kiss her
and his jealousy getting the best of him he turns and leaves
daisy in her turban
listening to caroline read
whispers i knew id hurt you
maybe i intended to
benjamin on his way out of the apartment coming along the street
daisy running after him
i did what you told me to
enjoy my life
im only going to be young once
i had no idea you were coming
what did you think i was going to do
you cant expect me to just drop everything benjamin
this is my life
and we see david and a group of her dancer friends have come outside down the way into the street
looking for cabs
to daisy theres a party downtown were going to
conflicted to benjamin why dont you come with us benjamin
therell be a lot of musicians interesting people there
youll have a good time
i came here to tell you i made a mistake before
a day doesnt go by that i dont regret it
its not the way i felt
i should have never let you go
i came because i hoped i could be with you
daisy you going to come
cabs have pulled up
between her life and some other life
benjamin recognizing her conflict
do you love him
daisy in bed
did you mother
daisy snaps back to the reality of the room
starts to put the pieces together
i think so
i think i do
we see the dancers scrambling getting into the taxis
ill see you in new orleans
he turns to go
shes motionless caught between the two worlds
and we expect her to yell after him to stop him
but instead she does what we all do in these moments what feels good at the time
she runs to be with her friends
she gets into a taxi
the cab drives by him as they leave
daisy turned to look out the back window
looking back at him
letting her go
and another chance for them is missed
the streets quiet
and hands in his pockets a middle aged man going on
he walks off into the night
remembers he came to tell me his father had died
you couldnt have known
i just didnt care
shes quiet with her thoughts
and remembering she hums to herself some distant memory of music
there are some photographs i think
the zipper part of the large bag
caroline goes to the suitcases
she comes back with a manila envelope
daisy dumps them out
and we see theyre photographs of daisy dancing at the height of her abilities
ive never seen these
you never talked about your dancing very much
daisy looks at the photographs
i was as good as i was ever going to be
for five years
i danced everywhere
london prague vienna and i was the only american invited to dance with the bolshoi
it was glorious
and we see daisy five years older her arm inside a tall young blond russian dancers anitoly crossing a snowy street in moscow
but benjamin was never far from my thoughts
daisy in bed the young russian dancer anitoly lying beside her asleep
daisy looking off
id find myself saying
we see benjamin in bed turning off the light
id find myself saying
a beat saying goodnight daisy
and as they both lie in their beds
thinking of the other
what did he say
life wasnt very complicated
we see benjamin on tizzys old motorcycle riding along the backroads of the endless swamps known as the bayou if you want you could say i was looking for something
as he rides away
life went on as usual
benjamin in work clothes on a ladder painting some old window shutters
queenie opens the window
to tell him
la tourneau just passed away
queenie shuts the window
until one day
a messenger on a bicycle rides up
i have a telegram for mr
that would be me
he comes down the ladder
the messenger gives him the telegram and getting his tip rides off benjamin opens the telegram
we see benjamin carrying a suitcase running along a street in paris
looking for an address
he stops in front of an old hospital
runs up the stairs
benjamin crosses an old tile floor to a reception desk
he asks for daisy
a woman calls up for him
it will just be a minute
please have a seat
benjamin sits in the waiting room
sometimes we are on a collision course and we just dont know it
whether its by accident or by design theres not a thing we can do about it
a woman in paris was on her way to go shopping
but she had forgotten her coat
and went back to get it
and when she had gotten her coat the phone had rung
and so she had stopped to answer it
and talked for a couple of minutes
and we see just that
and while the woman was on the phone daisy was rehearsing for that evenings performance at the paris opera house
and we see daisy in her late twenties now at the peak of her abilities rehearsing for that evenings performance
and while she was rehearsing
the woman off the phone now
had gone outside
to get a taxi
the woman standing in the street hand raised looking for a taxi
a cab comes to a stop
she moves to get it
but somebody gets there first
the cab driving off
and as she waits for the next cab
now a taxi driver
had dropped off a fare earlier
and had stopped to get a cup of coffee
a taxi parked
its driver finishing a cup of coffee
and all the while daisy was rehearsing
and we see just that
and the cab driver who had dropped off the earlier fare and had stopped to get the cup of coffee
had picked up the lady who was going shopping
who had missed getting the earlier cab
we see the woman riding in the taxi of the now familiar cab driver
the taxi has to stop for a man running across the street
the taxi had to stop for a man crossing the street who had left for work five minutes later than he normally did
because he forgot to set his alarm
we see the man sleeping
the silent alarm clock on the bedstand
while the man late for work was crossing the street
making the cab wait
daisy finished rehearsing was taking a shower
and we see
while daisy was showering the taxi was waiting outside a boutique for the woman to pick up a package
which hadnt been wrapped yet because the girl who was supposed to wrap it
had broken up with her boyfriend the night before and forgot to
the girl standing outside the back of the boutique crying brokenhearted
when the package was done being wrapped
the woman who was back in the cab
the taxi was blocked by a delivery truck
we see the taxi blocked by a delivery truck
the cab driver honking
all the while daisy was getting dressed
daisy getting dressed
the delivery truck pulled off and the taxi was able to go
the taxi moving off
while daisy the first to be dressed waited for one of her friends who had broken a shoelace
we see her friend breaking her shoelace while tying it
while the taxi was stopped waiting for a traffic light
we see just that the taxi stopped for a light
daisy and her friend came out of the theater
daisy and her friend carrying their dance bags coming down the steps out of the theater coming along the street to the corner
they start to cross the street
daisy showing her friend a tight pirouette when we see the taxi rounding the corner
and if only one thing had happened differently
if only the shoelace hadnt broken
and we see the shoelace not breaking
or the delivery truck had moved moments earlier
the delivery truck leaving earlier
or the package had been wrapped and ready
because the girl hadnt broken up with her boyfriend
the girl and boy happily kissing
or the man had set his alarm and got up five minutes earlier
the mans alarm going off waking him up
or the taxi driver hadnt stopped for a cup of coffee
the driver passing by the cafe
or the woman had remembered her coat
the woman remembering to take her coat
and had gotten into an earlier cab
the woman getting into the other cab
she beats somebody for
daisy and her friend would have crossed the street
daisy and her friend crossing the street
daisy showing her friend her dance move doing a pirouette
and the taxi would have driven by them
and we see the taxi turning the corner driving safely by them
and becoming a ghost
of what might have been
but life being what it is
a series of intersecting lives and incidents
out of anyones control
the taxi did not go by
and the driver momentarily was distracted
the driver wipes cigarette ash from his shirt front momentarily looking down
and he didnt see daisy crossing the street
daisy and her friend crossing the street daisy doing the pirouette
and that taxi hit daisy
and we see just that
daisy being slammed into by the taxi
thrown a distance
lying crumpled in the street
we see benjamin coming into the hospital room in france
daisy fully immobilized lying in a hospital bed
and her leg was crushed
shes still her eyes closed
sensing him she stirs
and then she sees him
who told you
your friend wired me
that was very kind of you
to come all the way here to see that i was alright
you would have done the same for me
and her first reaction to how young he is
my god look at you
which she isnt
shes quiet and she suddenly says
i wish you hadnt
i wish you hadnt come here
hes dead still
i dont want you to see me like this
she turns over
as if she didnt see him he wouldnt be there
before he can say anything
a nurse comes in saying something in french
she pulls the curtains around the bed
her leg had been broken in five places
and with therapy and time she might be able to stand
maybe even walk
the nurse leaves
benjamin comes into the circle of curtains
its reminiscent of when they sat under the table
the sheets over them
in their private world
but this time she lays in the hospital bed her back to him
ill get a room
and once you can leave youll come home with me to new orleans
where you can be with people who love you
she suddenly turns
im not going back to new orleans
new orleans is your home
i dont have a home
i havent been home for five years
im not going anywhere with you
alright ill stay here in paris
ill help you with anything you need
i know im feeling sorry for myself
but it wasnt supposed to be like this
do you understand i dont want to be with you
i tried to tell you that in new york
you just dont listen
youll change your mind
were not little children playing under the table
remember when you came to new york
you didnt belong there
i didnt want to be with you then i dont want to be with you now
i want you to leave
im not going anywhere with you
i want you to stay out of my life
and she turns away from him again
its dead still
and we look at her staring at the curtains
and after some moments she turns back to look at benjamin
and there are just the curtains billowing in the breeze
benjamin is gone
i was awfully cruel
he didnt understand
i couldnt have him see me that way
she waits for benjamins response
reading i didnt leave right away
i stayed in paris for awhile just to look out for her
benjamin in paris
i never knew that
benjamin in paris watching over her
daisy in bed
she winces with pain
her breathing becoming ragged
ill get the nurse
she goes into the hall
daisy left to deal with the remnants of her mortality
the nurse coming into the room
caroline behind her
times her pulse
lets get you comfortable
she raises the morphine level
straightens her covers
she stops before she leaves
motions to caroline
caroline going over to her
pulse rates slowing
shes getting less oxygen
youll notice her struggle to breathe
will you be alright
the nurse gives her a compassionate look and leaves
caroline stands her arms protectively across her chest watching her mother
daisy hums the particular ragtime song that benjamin would play on the piano
she opens her eyes as if not completely sure where she is
every morning monsieur foley leaves eggs and bread and mil
theres a cafe across the street
people sitting and drinking and talking
i lay on my bed thinking about the rest of my life
until i fall asleep
she looks at caroline as if to say what happened to him
reading he said i went back
but then there are a whole lot of pages torn out
she looks at a loose piece of paper
i listened to the sound of the house
i think i already read that
looking the next thing he wrote
he spilled something on it
its hard to read
something about sailing
does that make sense
in her own reality a man would go up and clean it
try and fix what was broken
a man up on the clock doing just that
closing its face
the cherubic angels pushing the hands on its way backwards
we see a sailboat out on the lake
i learned to sail on an old boat of my fathers from the lake house
and we see benjamin the wind in his hair sailing an old sailboat
and the change in his appearance is startling
his hair is without a trace of gray
his face with barely a wrinkle chiseled
he is a healthy man in his s now
i cant lie i did enjoy the company of a woman or two
benjamin and a woman standing on the sidewalk outside a restaurant in the middle of an ardent kiss
as a taxi pulls up
benjamin at the door kissing another woman goodbye
going home benjamins door opening
another woman disheveled coming out of his room
or maybe three
benjamin seeing her to the stairs
and as she starts down the stairs to leave
we see a cluster of old people ready for the day looking up at them
the woman making her way awkwardly down the stairs and out the door
benjamin gives a little self conscious wave to the old timers and starts back into his room
he slows at a second story hallway window
looking outside at the walkway
the familiar street beyond
if we didnt know any better he seems to be waiting for someone to come home and in the spring of
we see benjamin riding the old motorcycle along the street on his way home
leaves the motorcycle out in front
he comes to the gate opening it coming into the yard shutting the gate behind him going up the walkway
an old man is on the porch quietly rocking
and queenie for some reason is standing just outside the front door on the porch
an apron in her hands
she nods to benjamin
talking to the old man in the rocking chair
but she seems to be watching benjamin as he walks around the house to the back door
he takes off his dirty work boots leaves them on the porch
he hops the back steps and starts to open the kitchen door when it opens
and daisy now but still with her unmistakable blue eyes is standing before him
she came back
they look at each other in silence
and they simply smile so glad to see each other after all the missing years
for some time
as people who havent seen each other and have thought about each other
for a very long time
and it just is
no big symphonies no endless skies
just two people at a kitchen door in the middle of their lives
and the simplicity just that is what makes it real and breaks your heart
a radio plays
they sit at the kitchen table eating dinner
the conversation muted
they dont know really where to begin where did they leave oft
so they dont begin until they can
dont you want to know where ive been
i dont care where youve been im just happy youre back
and we see queenie has come into the kitchen
in her nightgown now
pure queenie how come you didnt write or nothin
just disappearing like that
it was what i needed to do for myself
i never took you to be selfish
i hope im not wrong
im not usually wrong about people
and queenie leaves the kitchen
shes still taking care of you
benjamin slightly smiles
they look at each other
youre not talking
you havent said more than two words to me
i dont want to ruin it
and they sit quietly in the kitchen looking at each other silently eating
benjamin carries her bags upstairs
they reach the third floor
all the years seem to surround them
they walk along the corridor to daisys room
what was her grandmothers room
she opens the door
he sets her bags down
queenie despite her reservations has left some clean towels on the bed for her
theres an inept quiet
the two of them with nothing left to say
and they listen to the quiet
the house with its symphony of night noises
he is just at the door
when she says
sleep with me
are you sure
he turns to her
they look at each other
and they kiss a kiss that has waited for thirty years
a kiss that has waited a lifetime
and yes there is passion
but most particularly the awkwardness of people discovering each other for the first time
while he gently tenderly kisses her undresses her
are you sure you dont want to know
while they kiss and caress each other
i lived in lyon
benjamin and daisy undressing one another touching kissing
i learned to walk again daisy and benjamin naked passionately kissing
i worked in a flower shop
they lay on the bed kissing caressing
i went to american movies a lot
they kiss more and more passionately
and benjamin about to make love to her hesitates
you wont hurt me
he kisses her scarred crooked leg
kisses her body
and as they make love in the old bedroom
i asked her to come with me
what follows feels like a home movie
without any sound
and we see the small sailboat out on the gulf coast
we sailed into the gulf
along the florida coast
daisy and benjamin on the sailboat at a cove on the florida coast
they watch a rocket soaring into space from cape caniveral
as they watch it roar overhead benjamin marvels at its power
leaving its trail across the sky
daisy not so much interested taking his arm taking him back down below
daisy washing her hair off the side of the boat
the boat anchored
benjamin and daisy sitting on the deck having a picnic with just a single lamp for light
the boat in still another cove
daisy and benjamin in the water
just their eyes above the dark water looking only at each other
under millions of stars
benjamin and daisy making love on a blanket on the deck
benjamin and daisy asleep on a secluded beach
the boat out on the water daisy sitting on the deck the wind in her hair
benjamin at the wheel
threatening clouds on the horizon
im so glad we didnt find one another when i was
im glad we missed
why do you say that
it wasnt right
a small caribbean hotel
we see benjamin and daisy sitting at a table drinking talking in a nearly empty bar
wind and rain lashing the hotel
waiting out a tropical storm
we wouldnt have this
we wouldnt be here
it happened when it was supposed to happen
they look at each other
relationships have a time and a place
dont say that
what i mean is
you dont usually get more than one chance
if you miss it its too late
and its gone
we had more than one chance
laughs thats easy for you to say
youll have plenty of chances
she tenderly touches his hand
they look at each other
and dedicating herself
im going to enjoy every moment i have with you
the waiters come over
have you ever had a sazerac with whiskey not brandy
smiles im with you arent i
ill try anything
and the wind changes direction the rain coming in through the open windows of the bar getting them wet
people run for cover
bet i can stay out here longer than you can
bet you cant
and as they both sit doggedly in the rain
a white hotel room
the storm shutters closed
the wind and the rain banging at the shutters
daisy and benjamin lying together on a bed out of the storm
she touches his face as if for the first time
you barely have a line a crease or a wrinkle
everyday i have more wrinkles you have less
he touches her face
i love your wrinkles
what does it feel like growing younger
i dont know
im always looking out of my own eyes
theyre quiet just the sound of the rain and the chattering shutters
she lays closer to him
will you still love me when i cant stand straight
when my skin grows old and spotted
will you still love me when my step gets slow
when i sleep too much
when you have to push me in a chair
and his answer is
will you still love me when i have pimples
when i think its funny to make fart noises
will you still love me when i think all girls have cooties
will you still love me when i wet my bed at night
will you still love me when im afraid of things that arent real
they hold each other
and benjamin says
from what hes seen
maybe some things last
ive never seen anything not come to an end
maybe its something you cant see
and a shutter slams open
the rain and the wind coming into the room
benjamin gets up to close it
he comes back into bed
and daisy suddenly afraid
im cold benjamin
and as he holds her in the white room with the wind and the rain trying to get in banging on the shutters
the storms died down
benjamin and daisy falling asleep
and you said
and i said
that shes stopped caroline
after a beat slightly confused i dont understand
when did you meet dad
some time after that
did you ever tell him about this benjamin
he knew enough
he loved me as i was
i loved him for who he was
what more was needed
she trails off
and wanting to know whats next reading on
that night in the caribbean i had a visitor
benjamin and daisy sleeping
the shutters quietly talking on a breeze
when one of the shutters slams open as if somebodys come in
benjamin wakes up
and he literally sees queenie is sitting on the side of the bed beside him
i wanted to tell you i love you and your mamas gone
and she bends sweetly kissing him
and benjamin rolls over
his eyes come open
daisy sensing hes awake awakening murmurs
is anything wrong
queenie came to tell me she loved me
and that my mother was gone
go back to sleep
as she caresses him
falling back to sleep
the shutters talking
we see daisy and benjamin with their few belongings returning home
they go up the walkway
benjamin trots up the steps opens the screen door and goes inside
benjamin comes inside
daisys just behind him
the front room is empty
the house still
he looks into the parlor
he goes down a hallway into the kitchen
he goes down the hall looking in queenies small room under the stairs
he moves back into the front room
when finally an old woman whos been sleeping comes out of her bedroom
its benjamin mrs
where is everybody
your mother died
the church crowded
and we see benjamin and daisy coming in the back as the service is ending
they are the only white people there
benjamin walks to the open casket
standing by his mothers side as the choir sings a hallelujah chorus
we buried her beside her beloved mr
a predominantly african american cemetery
overgrown and old
the mourners almost all of them old white people standing at queenies gravesite alongside her beloved mr
we see queenies daughter among the mourners
in her early s herself now
and benjamin standing over his mothers grave
saying his goodbyes
we are meant to lose the people we love
its how we know how important they are to us
and so we could have memories of our own i sold my fathers house on blaine street
the old house in a now decaying new orleans neighborhood
but despite the faltering area the house retains a dignity of its own
we see a young pregnant woman a renter being shown by benjamin along with a real estate agent around the old house
its such a lovely place
you must have a lot of fond memories
it must be hard for you to give it up
benjamin doesnt say anything
theres a knock on the door
benjamin opens it to let an older man in
quite a bit older
williamson here yet
im sorry to be late
and he sees his wife
pleased to see her
tenderly kissing her
and their age difference readily obvious
benjamin acutely aware of it
its a wonderful old place darling
i think we will be so happy here
they go into the hallway lined with the family photographs
shes taken by them
oh what a long family history you have
they come with the house
and we bought a house of our own
benjamin and daisy sitting on the front steps of a suburban new orleans townhouse a small screened front porch with a tree in front
murmurs i loved that house
it smelled like firewood
the chimney leaked smoke
we didnt care
oh dont stop dear
she closes her eyes
it was one of the happiest times of my life
we had no furniture to speak of
we would have picnics in the living room
benjamin and daisy having a picnic on the virtually empty living room floor
we slept on a mattress
we see benjamin and daisy sleeping on a mattress on the floor in the bedroom
we vowed never to go to bed or wake up at the same time
we lived on that mattress
and we see just that a short film of two people who cant get enough of each other living on a mattress
daisy and benjamin at various times while they are either sleeping or talking or eating or reading or making love on the mattress on the floor
our neighbor mrs
van dam was a physical therapist
we see daisy in the screened in front porch exercising her leg under the supervision of an older woman
we lived four blocks from a public pool
we see daisy in a bathing suit resting from swimming holding on to the side of the pool watching a young well conditioned girl with nothing but her life ahead
of her completely in tune with her body swimming laps
and as it comes to all of us painfully aware of the years passing her own physical mortality she starts to cry
and we see that benjamin come to meet her is standing above her
its just the chlorine
looking at the young girl
looking at her
you chose something to do
something so special
there was such a short period of time that you could do it
even if nothing had happened sooner or later you would be in the same place you are now
she knows what hes saying is true
i dont like getting old
benjamin daisy holding onto him riding the old motorcycle along the lake
daisy sits in the familiar deck chair his father had sat in looking out at the lake
benjamin brings her a cup of coffee
he sits on the deck on his heels beside her
i promise you ill never lose myself to self pity again
and as they watch the day begin
and i think right there and then she realized none of us is perfect forever
the window has started to rattle again
the wind knocking
i thought the wind had shifted away
daisy doesnt say anything lying still staring off
her breathing shallow laboring
agitated i dont remember if i turned the lights off
did i leave the heater on
the nurse on her way by seeing her distress
lets get you comfortable
she gently covers her
daisy quietly lies back
shes getting ready to leave
she looks at caroline and turns and leaves the room
caroline quietly looks at her mother
their eyes meet
you have the most beautiful eyes
caroline reaches to hold her thin hand
daisy says something to herself
caroline looks at her
she looks down at the book
he said she found peace
says to herself peace
a small dance studio
a scratchy phonograph record playing music
young girls learning how to dance
she opened a dance studio
and we see daisy in a long skirt over a long sleeved leotard
the first time weve seen her dressed like this in many a year
happily teaching young girls how to dance
we see daisy alone
music playing on the record player
and for a brief moment she stops and dances
the smallest most tentative of steps
she sees in the studios mirrors benjamins been silently watching her
youre still beautiful to watch
she looks at herself in the dance mirror
just what happens
dancing is all about the line
the line of your body
you lose the line
and you can never get it back
they look at each other in the mirror
i figured out if you were born in
were almost the same age
in three years well meet in the middle
and what she doesnt say what they both know is shes going one way and hes going the other
smiles we finally caught up to each other
she smiles starts to turn
stay just like that
i want to remember what we look like right now
they stay like that for a moment longer
she turns to get her things
she shuts off the lights
she takes his arm
i thought i was far too old
they look at each other she smiles nodding yes its true
and deeply moved he takes her in his arms
touching her face
stopped you were pregnant
you never said anything did you
i mean what happened to the child
wistful the child
were not sure what more she is about to say her breathing rasps
shes having some difficulty breathing
getting up they said if you needed oxygen
i want to breathe on my own
and sit down my darling
caroline respects her wishes
wanting her to continue im pregnant
and caroline wanting to know what happened herself
eyes closed murmurs hmmm
she was happier than i had ever seen her
benjamin and daisy riding a street car talking
i thought i heard the nurse slip and say he
as they ride benjamin looks over watching a father sitting with his child
daisy notices his look
benjamin and daisy sitting at the window at one of the booths
daisy with a hot fudge sundae and a tuna sandwich
benjamin just some coffee
and daisy says
i know youre afraid
im not hiding it
whats your worst fear
what if it has
what if its like me
then well love it all the more
i want to be father
not a little brother
i dont want to be picked up from elementary school by my kid
i dont want anyone babysitting me
im going to make this work
this is what i want and i want it with you
you know theres nothing i wouldnt do for you
would you tell a blind man he cant have children
you will be a father for as long as you can
i know the consequences
i accepted that
your love loving you is worth everything to me
laughs for the fiftieth time today ive got to go pee
she gets up and goes to the restroom
he sits with his thoughts
and he notices a televisions on
a news report
something catches his eye
he gets up moving to the television
where he hears
on television the oldest woman to ever swim the english channel arrived in calais today
having made the swim in thirty four hours twenty two minutes and fourteen seconds
the sixty eight year old englishwoman elizabeth abbott
and we see dear elizabeth abbott coming out of the water completing the english channel swim
on television anythings possible
and as she smiles after a lifetime of waiting triumphant
and benjamin smiles for her and for himself too
where anything is possible
daisys come beside him
he leaves some money
he takes her arm
and as they go outside moving along the street
on a day like any other in the spring
we see benjamin in the bedroom putting on a shirt
and theres the sound of something falling
and he runs out of the room
to see daisy fallen sitting on the stairs
a glass of milk spilled on the carpet
and blood on her nightdress
he runs to a phone
get me an ambulance
my wife is seven months pregnant and fell on the stairs
the babys coming
and he hurries to her side
and as she clasps his hand
paramedics are there
tending to daisy benjamin at her side as she struggles
she gave birth to a five pound four ounce baby girl
we see lying on daisys chest is a newborn baby
benjamin standing beside her
and a young woman doctor thats there
packing up her things
youre sure theres nothing wrong with her
shes a normal healthy baby in every way
and benjamin moved kisses the babys head
as he looks at this precious child of his
we named her caroline for my mother
and as benjamin holds daisys hand while she nurses her
carolines stopped reading
he was my father
this benjamin was my father
why didnt you ever tell me
it doesnt change for a moment who you are
you were a gift
sometimes the gifts we are given are not free
you never said a word to me
caroline upset gets up
i need to go for a minute
she leaves the room
enigmatic my dearest darling we were both deprived of him
daisy lying still
in her turban
her blue eyes
her breathing rasping
caroline stands in the hall
the bustle of the hospital the exigencies of life going on about her
the nurse seeing her
it can get to you
and caroline unable to hold it in cant stop bitter tears from running down her face
the nurse is called for
she goes off down the hallway
caroline takes another moment and goes back into the hospital room
daisy seeing her come back in
i was worried you werent coming back
after a moment youre all i have
read the rest of it darling
caroline hesitates then sits back down and quietly takes up the book
you grew like the doctor had said normal and healthy
the rooms dark
we see benjamin in bed the baby sleeping between him and daisy
and as benjamin watches them sleep
he looks at his reflection in a wall mirror
his st year on this earth
a young man
he looks at his baby
he looks at daisy
in her mid s
her hairs begun to gray
her face begun to show the natural touches of age
his stare awakens her
she looks at him sensing hes deeply troubled
he shuts his eyes
she watches him sleep daisy as troubled as he is
but for very different reasons
benjamin is sitting with caroline while she plays in a parks sand box
caroline helping herself to a mouthful of sand
benjamin trying to get the sand out of her mouth
dont eat sand
daisy comes over to sit with them
shes going to have a really attractive diaper
as they sit watching caroline playing in the sand
i think you should find a real father for her
what are you talking about
she needs someone to grow old with
shell learn to accept whatever happens
she loves you
she needs a father not a playmate
is it that my age is starting to show
is that what you are telling me
have you lost your desire for me
you dont need another child to raise
youre going to leave me arent you
he doesnt say anything
you cant leave me
you cant do this to me
it was your first birthday
we had a party
the house was filled with people
the birthday party
a cake with a big number candle
one year olds not having a clue
the fathers and mothers were there
he looks at the age appropriate mothers and fathers with their children
before you look around theyll be in high school dating
benjamin manages a smile
i remember your first birthday like it was yesterday
the house is empty the guests gone
daisy busy cleaning up from the party
she stops to look outside at the backyard
benjamin is sitting on a lounge chair
the baby in her party dress sitting on his chest
as daisy stands at the window watching him with their baby
benjamin dressed watching caroline in her crib asleep
daisy in bed asleep
i sold the summer house on lake pontchartrain
i sold my share of buttons buttons
i sold the sailboat
i put it all into an account for your mother
and before you would ever remember me
and he bends to kiss his sleeping daughter whispering to her
i want you to know i love you
he stops to put a bank book on the dresser along with a house key
the sound of the key is just enough for daisy to stir
he starts to leave
he turns to go
and he sees daisy is looking at him
a look not so much of anger or hurt not of resignation but a look of acceptance
that this is what her life is now
he crosses out of the dark room silently closing the door behind him
i left so that you and your mother could have a life
he takes the old motorcycle out of the garage
after a beat i left with just the clothes on my back
he starts the motorcycle and with just the shirt on his back he rides away
daisy still lying in bed the sound of the motorcycle driving away
she gets up
she takes the baby out of her crib and into bed with her holding her baby in the bare light
daisy in her regal turban silently looking out the window
the wind knocking loudly again
i almost wish i didnt know any of this
shes quiet after a beat i feel odd reading
she looks at the book
where did he go
i dont know
i never heard from him
caroline distant picks through the book
she comes upon
there are postcards
looking through them
theyre all addressed to me
theyre from all sorts of places
and she realizes
theyre for my birthday
i would have been two
i wish i could have kissed you goodnight
reading another one happy birthday youre five
i wish i could have taken you to your first day of school
reading on happy birthday six year old
i wish i could be there to teach you how to play the piano
told you not to chase some boy
held you when you had a broken heart
i was fifteen
i wish i could have been your father
nothing i ever did will replace that
which brings caroline back to the book
reads what i think is
and benjamins voice comes in
while we see him in
what i think is its never too late
or in my case too early to be whoever you want to be
theres no time limit start anytime you want
change or stay the same
there arent any rules
we can make the best or worst of it
i hope you make the best
i hope you see things that startle you
feel things you never felt before
i hope you meet people who have a different point of view
i hope you challenge yourself
i hope you stumble and pick yourself up
i hope you live the life you wanted to
and if you havent i hope you start all over again
when we come out of those images
caroline finishes reading
i hope you start all over again
just the wind knocking
she looks at her mother
but daisys staring somewhere else
takes up reading again
id been gone for a long time
echoes hed been gone for a long time
to the dance studio
a records playing piano music
classes are done
parents taking their children
we see daisy in her long skirt
helping pick up with her hands and her nimble toes errant clothing the jackets the sweaters
it takes us a moment to recognize her
in the some twelve years since weve last seen her now her hairs cut short
and its gone mostly gray
and although her age is on her face she still has a dancers posture her head held high
carrying herself with grace
and one thing that will never change are her unforgettable blue eyes
we hear the door opening
daisy busy gathering saying her goodnights
glances toward the door across the studio
and she sees a young man has come in a young man in his twenties
standing silently a stranger standing by the door
daisy as she closes up the studio makes her way toward him saying goodnight to people
she bends to pick up a ballet slipper
somebody left their slipper
daisy looks over the young man hasnt moved
the studio has all but emptied
she walks toward him
hes wearing worn trousers a coat thats seen better days
are you here to pick someone up
he shakes no
im sorry were closed now
she moves to open the door to show him out
when she gets a good look at him
she stops realizing who it is
and shes taken aback by his youth we all are
sixteen years younger
in his s now
its at once staggering and heartbreaking
what age can do
and she realizes at that very moment he was right all along
youre so young
they look at each other
when shes able to find the words
why did you come back
i wanted to see you both
she stares at him
just the piano music
and despite the gulf of time
theres a terrible aching they have for each other
and before they can say anything
the door swings open and caroline comes hurrying in
you ready mom
benjamin stares at her appearance
and daisy cant help herself and seeing caroline daisy overcome by it all starts to cry
is something wrong mother
he was telling me a very sad story about a mutual friend we hadnt seen in a long time
this is my friend benjamin
you knew him when you were
just a baby
he reaches taking her hand
needing to touch her
and a man s wearing a suit and a tie comes in
i thought you were done
this is a friend of my familys
this is my husband
they shake hands
theres an awkward quiet
it was nice to have met you
well be in the car darling
im just closing up
and robert and caroline go outside to wait for her
shes so lovely
she looks like you
does she dance
not very well
i suppose that would be from my side of things
shes a dear sweet girl
she seems a little lost
but who isnt a little lost at
theres a lot of her that reminds me of you
and she shuts off a set of the lights
hes a doctor
was a widower
hes an incredibly bright adventurous man
hes been a terrific father
and a great partner and friend
and she shuts off the record player and another set of lights
and for a moment they stand in the dark studio
and they look at their reflections in the mirror
seeing who they are now
youre so much younger
just what you can see
she looks at him and after all these years
she now understands completely
she looks outside at her daughter standing by the car with her father waiting
you ware right
she needed a father
i couldnt have raised both of you
im not that strong
they both are
she looks at him
i never thought how it must have broken your heart too
his silence is enough
where are you staying
what are you going to do
im at the pontchartrain hotel on the avenue
i have no idea what im going to do
and it seems like they want to hold each other
but they cant
and aware of the cars headlights waiting at the curb
she turns holding the door open for him
i have to go
he walks by her going out
she stops to lock the door
she turns getting into the car
benjamin stands on the corner hands in his pockets the car driving by him
and daisy cant help but look at him
and then the cars gone
and as he crosses the street and walks off into the night
that young man was my father
and a nurse comes in
the hurricane changed directions again
they are predicting it will make landfall sometime soon
is there anything we need to do
arrangements are being made to move people if we have to
ill let you know as soon as we know anything
she leaves hurriedly
please tell me what he says
caroline looks at the book
and benjamins voice comes in
benjamin sitting on the end of the bed not sure why he came there at all
theres a sound at the door
as if somebody was there
he starts to get up and theres a knock on the door
he opens it
and daisys there
hes startled to see her
may i come in
she comes inside
an awkward quiet
i dont know what im doing here
what i expected
it echoes how shes feeling being there
they stand not knowing what to say
and daisy says sadly
he puts a finger to her lips
he shakes no
and what hes come to know that some things do last
i never once stopped loving you
he affectionately pushes a hair off of her forehead
im an old woman now benjamin
and he helps her off with her coat
he kisses her
and shes quiet
and he undresses her
and they stand momentarily naked
the young man and the older woman
are you sure
some things you dont ever forget
and he kisses her again
he puts his mouth by her cheek
breathing her in
of someone you love
we see benjamin standing at the window watching as daisy gets into a taxi
the taxi starting to drive off
and daisy turning
to look back
waving to him
benjamin waving to her
what they both somehow know is a last goodbye
i watched her go
and as the taxi drives away
until she went out of sight
the taxi going down the street and out of sight
for the last time
despite losing sight of her he still hasnt moved
standing by the window
daisy breath raspy sitting silently in her bed looking out the window
we realize carolines stopped reading
thats the last thing he wrote
they both are
alone with their thoughts
what happened to him after that last time with you mother
the wind has picked up considerably rattling the window even harder
a year or so after your father passed
there was a call
and we see daisy in her bathrobe in her sixties
drinking a cup of coffee
the telephone rings
speaking i dont understand
where was that
we see daisy riding in the back or a taxi
its the last house
she looks outside and we see up ahead of her the nolan house standing like a monument to time
daisy gets out
the taxi drives off
daisy stops for a moment before she opens the gate
the house has fallen into disrepair
a solitary old man sits on the porch rocking and rocking
she goes up the walk and out of habit goes around the back porch
to the kitchen
she comes into the kitchen
she moves down the hallway into the living room
the interior has also fallen on hard times
some old people are still in residence predominantly african americans now
queenies daughter now in her fifties herself stands in the living room
along with a plain man in a plain suit
the man turns
thank you for coming
im david hernandez with the orleans parish department of child welfare services
queenies daughter turns on a lamp
it doesnt work
she crosses the room to turn on another
he was found living in a condemned building off of east lamont
the police found this with him
and your name
and he gives her the journal
he was in very poor health
he was taken to the hospital
he doesnt seem to know who or where he is
hes very confused
the doctors who looked at him think he may be autistic
i told mr
hernandez about benjamin bein one of us
i told him if he needs a place to stay
he can stay here
he is blood after all
and just then we hear a piano playing
as if it were being played by a child
with no skill
banging as much as anything
and daisy follows the sound of the piano into the parlor
and she sees his back
just a boy of now
trying to play the piano
trying to play the tune the woman had taught to him
he turns at the sound of her voice
there is no indication he recognizes her at all
do you know this song
and he tries to play what he thinks is the song but is nothing more than a child playing random notes
you play really beautifully
she comes and touches his back
he shrinks from her touch
he doesnt seem to like to be touched
and while he tries to play
the doctors said if they didnt know any better he goes in and out of states of recognition as if he had the beginnings of dementia
daisys looking at the boy who was once the man she loved
who she still loves
she looks into his eyes
do you remember me
he looks at her
no sense of recognition
daisy is a very pretty name
its good to meet you benjamin
do you mind if i sit with you
i would love to hear you play
he doesnt say anything
she sits down beside him on the piano bench
he stops to look at her
theres something about you
theres something about your eyes i remember from a long time ago
he looks at her eyes
she looks at him
and as she sits with him on the piano bench
as he tries to play
daisy and benjamin together again
queenies daughter saw to it that he was taken care of
and we see benjamin just eight now
coming into the kitchen
queenies daughter cleaning up after breakfast
i want some breakfast
you just ate breakfast
no i didnt
you just finished eating mr
you think i dont know what you are doing
and like an eight year old or an old man old with onset alzheimers which makes him nearly a helpless child he starts to rage
you are all fucking liars
and every day i would stop by
and make sure he was comfortable
and just then daisy comes into the kitchen
she sees him raging
he doesnt believe hes already had his breakfast
lets see if we can find something else for you to do
upset meaning lapses i cant help it
i cant help this
i know you cant
and as she puts her arm around him taking him out of the room understanding
many times he would simply forget who and where he was at all
we see daisy sitting on a bed with benjamin in his room on the second floor of the old house
and hes oddly lucid
more articulate than his age would indicate
i get the feeling theres a lot of things i cant remember
what do you mean
its like theres this whole life i had and i cant remember what it was
hes frustrated by it
its alright to forget things
and as she sits on his bed with him
in the upstairs room
it wasnt easy
and we see benjamin no more than six now standing on the roof
daisy standing on the ground down below him
nervous i wish youd come down
a little boy i can see everything
and he points out
i can see the big river
all the boats
i can see the graveyard where mamas buried and all those other people
i can see the city
where you have your dancing place
and tears fill daisys eyes
youre right you can see everything sweetheart
and he can
he can see all the way across to the mississippi river
the old graveyard
his whole life
i think you better come down
what if i could fly
and it looks like he might just try
stopping him i knew a man who could fly
come down and ill tell you all about him
hes quiet thinking about that
and acquiescing he turns up the roof out of sight
some short moments
and he comes running out the front door
his hands in his pockets like the brave little man he is
daisy bends down
and as he runs into her arms
daisy holding him
daisy propped in her bed looking out the window
and i went to take care of him
and we see daisy in her seventies now carrying a suitcase coming up the walkway and onto the porch
old people sitting in the porch chairs
he was five i think when i moved in
the same age i was when i had met him
and we see benjamin now sitting on the porch swing staring off
and he drools like a helpless old man
daisy stops taking out a handkerchief wiping the drool off his chin
how would you like to help me unpack
daisy unpacking her suitcase with benjamins help taking out an alarm clock a quilt some photographs
the just so book
her personal things
benjamin playing with the alarm clock making the alarm go off
again and again
benjamin in a small childs bed
daisy sitting on his bed reading from kiplings just so stories to him
this is the picture of old man kangaroo at five in the afternoon when he got his beautiful hind legs just as big god ngong had promised
the days passed
and we see benjamin just three or so now holding daisys hand walking with her in some autumn leaves
i watched as he forgot how to talk
benjamin almost two
sitting on daisys lap in the front room
points to her daisy
benjamin and daisy
proud of himself he smiles
how to walk
and we see him just like a toddler barely able to stand
daisy there to catch him from falling
i watched him sleep
daisy sitting on the porch on a rocking chair
benjamin just a baby now some months old sleeping in her lap
in they put a new clock on the train station wall
and we see a workman on a ladder taking down the old clock of mr
handing it down to another workman
and putting up a new clock
a digital clock
the time moving
the way its meant to be
daisy in her hospital bed
the wind howling at the window
in the spring of
shadows dapple the room
daisy sitting in an old chair in the middle of the room
with daylight streaming in on her
holding benjamin on her lap
a tiny thing now
he can almost fit in her two old hands
he looked at me
and we see him looking up at her
he looked into my eyes
and we see him looking into her eyes
and he moved his fingers
and with his little thumb he held my thumb
and thats just what he does
looking into daisys eyes
holding her thumb with his tiny hand
and as he had said
no matter what age he was
he was the same person behind his eyes
and at that moment i knew
he knew who i was
the baby staring into her blue eyes
and then he closed his eyes like he was sleeping
and we see his eyes flutter and softly close
and as he lays in his beloved daisys lap
the wind a full out hurricane
the lights flicker
im going to see what they want us to do
and as she gets up the book drops on the floor
and a cards fallen out
caroline picks it up
its a train schedule
she turns it over
im on a train in india filled with people
an overcrowded train car
people sitting and standing and lying on the seats and on the floor in every available space nook and cranny asleep
im the only one who isnt sleeping
now we see benjamin sitting on the floor among all of the people the only one awake writing on the back of the train schedule
i figured out one thing
if youre growing older or getting younger it really doesnt make any difference
whichever way youre going you have to make the most of what this is
he looks at all the people sleeping around him
strangers on a train
along the way you bump into people who make a dent on your life
get struck by lightning
and we see just that
daws being struck by lightning again
some are born to sit by a river
and we see just that
oti sitting by his river
some have an ear for music
and we see the unnamed older woman playing the piano
some are artists
and we see captain mike
with his tattoos standing on his tug
some swim the english channel
and we see elizabeth abbott doing just that
some know buttons
we see thomas button holding a button in the palm of his hand
some know shakespeare
tizzy reciting shakespeare
some are mothers
queenie pointing at him
and some people can dance
and we see daisy dancing
he started to write something else
but he stopped
she gently puts the card back
i wish i had known him
now you do
and the wind reminds her
id better go and see what theyre planning to do
caroline goes out of the room
daisys alone now
looking out the window
at the howling hurricane
a hundred mile an hour fury
and fighting against the wind trying to reach the window is a hummingbird
it almost makes it and is pushed back by the gale
but undaunted its wings doing a figure eight
the symbol for infinity
it fights its way through the wind to the window
tapping at the window
and the hummingbird flies away
she watches it go
and after some moments she says
and she closes her eyes for the very last time
and its dark
where its peaceful even safe
we see the new clock high on the terminal wall running the right way
and as the clock turns
people hurrying to their destinations living their lives
a storage room
old track signs
old waiting room chairs
the discarded and forgotten
and lying on its side under an old tarpaulin is mr
the angel still pushing the hands
