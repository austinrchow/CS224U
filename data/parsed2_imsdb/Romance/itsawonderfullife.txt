href b b by frances goodrich albert hackett frank capra jo swerling series of shots of various streets and buildings in the town of bedford falls somewhere in new york
the streets are deserted and snow is falling
it is christmas eve
over the above scenes we hear voices praying i owe everything to george bailey

camera pulls up from the bailey home and travels up through the sky until it is above the falling snow and moving slowly toward a firmament full of stars
as the camera stops we hear the following heavenly voices talking and as each voice is heard one of the stars twinkles brightly hello joseph trouble
looks like well have to send someone down a lot of people are asking for help for a man named george bailey
yes tonights his crucial night

oh dear dear

the adventures of tom sawyer
clarence you do a good job with george bailey and youll get your wings
oh thank you sir
if youre going to help a man you want to know something about him dont you
well keep your eyes open
see the town
the stars fade out from the screen and a light indistinguishable blur is seen
i dont see a thing
oh i forgot
you havent got your wings yet
now look ill help you out
begin to see something
the blur on the screen slowly begins to take form
we see a group of young boys on top of a snow covered hill
this is amazing
if you ever get your wings youll see all by yourself
group of boys
they are preparing to slide down the hill on large shovels
one of them makes the slide and shoots out onto the ice of a frozen river at the bottom of the hill
as he slides yippee
hey whos that
thats your problem george bailey
thats him when he was twelve back in
something happens here youll have to remember later on
series of shots as four or five boys make the slide down the hill and out onto the ice
as each boy comes down the others applaud
george bailey at bottom of slide
through megaphone and here comes the scare baby my kid brother harry bailey
on top of hill preparing to make his slide
im not scared
ad lib come on harry
harry makes his slide very fast
he passes the marks made by the other boys and his shovel takes him onto the thin ice at the bend of the river
the ice breaks and harry disappears into the water
im coming harry
george jumps into the water and grabs harry
as he starts to pull him out he yells make a chain gang
the other boys lie flat on the ice forming a human chain
when george reaches the edge with harry in his arms they pull them both to safety
george saved his brothers life that day
but he caught a bad cold which infected his left ear
cost him his hearing in that ear
it was weeks before he could return to his after school job at old man gowers drugstore
five or six boys are coming toward camera arm in arm whistling
their attention is drawn to an elaborate horsedrawn carriage proceeding down the other side of the street
the carriage driving by
we catch a glimpse of an elderly man riding in it
the boys watching the carriage
whos that a king
thats henry f
potter the richest and meanest man in the county
the boys continue until they reach gowers drugstore
the drugstore is old fashioned and dignified with jars of colored water in the windows and little else
as the kids stop so long
ad lib got to work slave
george comes in and crosses to an old fashioned cigar lighter on the counter
he shuts his eyes and makes a wish wish i had a million dollars
he clicks the lighter and the flame springs up
george crosses over to the soda fountain at which mary hatch a small girl is seated watching him
george goes on to get his apron from behind the fountain
calling toward back room its me mr
gower the druggist peering from a window in back room
we see him take a drink from a bottle
george behind soda fountain
he is putting on his apron
violet bick enters the drugstore and sits on one of the stools at the fountain
she is the same height as mary and the same age but she is infinitely older in her approach to people
with warm friendliness hello george
then flatly as she sees mary lo mary
primly hello violet
george regards the two of them with manly disgust
they are two kids to him and a nuisance
he starts over for the candy counter
two cents worth of shoelaces
she was here first
im still thinking
to violet shoelaces
george goes over to the candy counter
to mary i like him
you like every boy
happily whats wrong with that
here you are
george gives violet a paper sack containing licorice shoelaces
violet gives him the money
the vamp help me down
disgusted help you down
violet jumps down off her stool and exits
mary watching sticks out her tongue as she passes
made up your mind yet
ill take chocolate
george puts some chocolate ice cream in a dish
i dont like coconuts
you dont like coconuts
say brainless dont you know where coconuts come from
lookit here from tahiti fiji islands the coral sea
he pulls a magazine from his pocket and shows it to her
a new magazine
i never saw it before
of course you never
only us explorers can get it
ive been nominated for membership in the national geographic society
he leans down to finish scooping out the ice cream his deaf ear toward her
she leans over speaking softly
is this the ear you cant hear on
george bailey ill love you till the day i die
she draws back quickly and looks down terrified at what she has said
im going out exploring some day you watch
and im going to have a couple of harems and maybe three or four wives
wait and see
he turns back to the cash register whistling
taking in entrance to prescription room at end of fountain
gower comes to the entrance
he is bleary eyed unshaven chewing an old unlit cigar
his manner is gruff and mean
it is evident he has been drinking
youre not paid to be a canary
he turns back to the cash register when he notices an open telegram on the shelf
he is about to toss it aside when he starts to read it
it reads we regret to inform you that your son robert died very suddenly this morning of influenza stop
everything possible was done for his comfort stop
we await instructions from you
edward mellington pres
george puts the telegram down
a goodness of heart expresses itself in a desire to do something for gower
he gives the ice cream to mary without comment and sidles back toward gower
gower drunk is intent on putting some capsules into a box
gower do you want something
anything i can do back here
george looks curiously at gower realizing that he is quite drunk
gower fumbles and drops some of the capsules to the floor
capsules spilling on floor at their feet
george and gower
ill get them sir
he picks up the capsules and puts them in the box
gower waves george aside takes his old wet cigar shoves it in his mouth and sits in an old morris chair in the background
george turns a bottle around from which gower has taken the powder for the capsules
its label reads poison
george stands still horrified
take these capsules over to mrs
shes waiting for them
george picks up the capsule box not knowing what to do or say
his eyes go harassed to the bottle labeled poison
georges fingers fumble
they have the diphtheria there havent they sir
gower stares moodily ahead sucking his cigar
george turns to him the box in his hand
is it a charge sir
gower i think
aw get going
george comes out into main room
as he puts on his cap he sees a sweet caporals ad which says with an inspiration george dashes out the door and down the street
mary follows him with her eyes
george runs down the street until he comes opposite a two story building with a sign on it reading bailey building and loan association
potters carriage is waiting at the entrance
suddenly he runs up the stairs
the offices are ancient and a bit on the rickety side
there is a counter with a grill something like a bank
before a door marked peter bailey private georges uncle billy stands obviously trying to hear what is going on inside
he is a very good humored man of about fifty in shirt sleeves
with him at the door also listening are cousin tilly bailey a waspish looking woman who is the telephone operator and cousin eustace bailey the clerk
the office vibrates with an aura of crisis as george enters and proceeds directly toward his fathers office
uncle billy listening at the door
as george is about to enter his fathers office uncle billy grabs him by the arm
avast there captain cook
where you headin
got to see pop uncle billy
some other time george
theres a squall in there thats shapin up into a storm
during the foregoing cousin tilly has answered the telephone and now she calls out uncle billy
who is it
closeup uncle billys left hand there are pieces of string tied around two of the fingers obviously to remind him of things he has to do
uncle billy looking at his hand
i should have called him yesterday
switch it inside
he enters a door marked william bailey private
george stands irresolute a moment aware of crisis in the affairs of the bailey building and loan association but aware more keenly of his personal crisis
he opens the door of his fathers office and enters
georges father is seated behind his desk nervously drawing swirls on a pad
he looks tired and worried
he is a gentle man in his forties an idealist stubborn only for other peoples rights
nearby in a throne like wheelchair behind which stands the goon who furnishes the motive power sits henry f
potter his squarish derby hat on his head
the following dialogue is fast and heated as though the argument had been in process for some time
im not crying mr
well youre begging and thats a whole lot worse
all im asking is thirty days more
just a minute son
to potter just thirty short days
ill dig up that five thousand somehow
to his goon shove me up
goon pushes his wheelchair closer to the desk
have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages
times are bad mr
a lot of these people are out of work
i cant do that
these families have children
theyre not my children
but theyre somebodys children
are you running a business or a charity ward
well all right
interrupting not with my money
potter what makes you such a hardskulled character
you have no family no children
you cant begin to spend all the money youve got
so i suppose i should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me
george cannot listen any longer to such libel about his father
he comes around in front of the desk
hes not a failure
you cant say that about my father
youre the biggest man in town
he pushes george toward the door
as george passes potters wheelchair he pushes the old mans shoulder
the goon puts out a restraining hand
george proceeds toward the door with his fathers hand on his shoulder
as they go gives you an idea of the baileys
george and his father at the door
dont let him say that about you pop
all right son thanks
ill talk to you tonight
bailey closes the door on george and turns back to potter
george stands outside the door with the capsules in his hand
gower talking on the telephone
george stands in the doorway
drunkenly why that medicine should have been there an hour ago
itll be over in five minutes mrs
he hangs up the phone and turns to george
blaines box of capsules
he grabs george by the shirt and drags him into the back room
shaking him did you hear what i said
frightened yes sir i
gower starts hitting george about the head with his open hands
george tries to protect himself as best he can
what kind of tricks are you playing anyway
why didnt you deliver them right away
dont you know that boys very sick
in tears youre hurting my sore ear
mary is still seated at the soda fountain
each time she hears george being slapped she winces
you lazy loafer
gower you dont know what youre doing
you put something wrong in those capsules
i know youre unhappy
you got that telegram and youre upset
you put something bad in those capsules
it wasnt your fault mr
george pulls the little box out of his pocket
gower savagely rips it away from him breathing heavily staring at the boy venomously
just look and see what you did
look at the bottle you took the powder from
i tell you its poison
i know you feel bad
george falters off cupping his aching ear with a hand
gower looks at the large brown bottle which has not been replaced on the shelf
he tears open the package shakes the powder out of one of the capsules cautiously tastes it then abruptly throws the whole mess to the table and turns to look
at george again
the boy is whimpering hurt frightened
gower steps toward him
dont hurt my sore ear again
but this time gower sweeps the boy to him in a hug and sobbing hoarsely crushes the boy in his embrace
george is crying too
dont hurt my ear again
sobbing oh george george
gower i wont ever tell anyone
i know what youre feeling
i wont ever tell a soul
hope to die i wont
it is late afternoon
a young man is looking over an assortment of luggage
across the counter stands joe hepner the proprietor of the store he is showing a suitcase
an overnight bag genuine english cowhide combination lock fitted up with brushes combs
as camera moves up closer to him he turns and we get our first glimpse of george as a young man
camera has moved up to a closeup by now
now look joe
now look i
i want a big one
suddenly in action as george stands with his arms outstretched in illustration the picture freezes and becomes a still
over this hold frame shot we hear the voices from heaven what did you stop it for
i want you to take a good look at that face
who is it
oh you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist
thats the kid
its a good face
i like it
i like george bailey
tell me did he ever tell anyone about the pills
not a soul
did he ever marry the girl
did he ever go exploring
well wait and see
the arrested closeup of george springs to life again
i dont want one for one night
i want something for a thousand and one nights with plenty of room for labels from italy and baghdad samarkand
a great big one
i see a flying carpet huh
i dont suppose youd like this old second hand job would you
he brings a large suitcase up from under the counter
now youre talkin
gee whiz i could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk
how much does this cost
thats my trick ear joe
it sounded as if you said no charge
indicating name on suitcase thats right
as he sees his name whats my name doing on it
a little present from old man gower
came down and picked it out himself
admiring the bag he did
whatta you know about that my old boss
what boat you sailing on
im working across on a cattle boat
a cattle boat
as he exits okay i like cows
the place is practically the same except that it is now full of school kids having sodas etc
a juke box and many little tables have been added
it has become the hangout of the local small fry
there are now three kids jerking sodas
gower is a different man now sober shaven and good humored
he is behind the counter when george comes in
gowers face lights up when he sees george
thanks ever so much for the bag
its just exactly what i wanted
aw forget it
oh its wonderful
hope you enjoy it
george suddenly sees the old cigar lighter on the counter
he closes his eyes and makes a wish
wish i had a million dollars
as he snaps the lighter the flame springs up
george shakes gowers hand vigorously and exits
pan shot as george crosses the street uncle billy cousin tilly and cousin eustace are leaning out of the second floor window of the building and loan offices
avast there captain cook
you got your sea legs yet
parlez vous francais
hey send us some of them picture postcards will you george
hey george dont take any plugged nickels
hey george your suitcase is leaking
george waves up at them and continues on across the street
as george crosses the street
he spots ernie and his cab and bert the motor cop parked alongside
ernie im a rich tourist today
how about driving me home in style
bert opens the door of the cab and puts georges suitcase inside
sure your highness hop in
and for the carriage trade i puts on my hat
as george is about to enter the cab he stops suddenly as he sees violet now obviously a little sex machine come toward him
her walk and figure would stop anybody
she gives him a sultry look
the three men by the cab but including violet
good afternoon mr
hey you look good
thats some dress you got on there
she reacts to this
oh this old thing
why i only wear it when i dont care how i look
as violet goes by george and bert raise their heads above the top of the cab
on violets back as she goes
as she crosses the street an elderly man turns to look at her and is almost hit by a car that pulls up with screeching brakes
ernie sticks his head out form the drivers seat
how would you like
as he enters cab yes
want to come along bert
well show you the town
bert looks at his watch then takes another look at violets retreating figure
think ill go home and see what the wifes doing
pop bailey is seated at the dinner table
bailey and annie the cook look up toward the vibrating ceiling
there are sounds of terrific banging and scuffling upstairs
annie pounds on the ceiling with a broom
calling out george
youre shaking the house down
oh let em alone
i wish i was up there with them
harryll tear his dinner suit
bailey is calling up the stairs
thats why all children should be girls
but if they were all girls there wouldnt be any
oh never mind
calling upstairs george
come down to dinner this minute
everythings getting cold and you know weve been waiting for you
she goes up the stairs
pop is smiling and poking his plate
a commotion is heard on the stairs the boys imitating fanfare music
down they come holding their mother high between them on their hands
they bring her into the dining room and deposit her gracefully into pops lap
heres a present for you pop
pop kisses her
mother gives pop a quick hug then turns with all the wrath she can muster on the two boys
oh you two idiots
george sit down and have dinner
well arent you going to finish dressing for your graduation party
look at you
i dont care
its georges tux
annie crosses the room holding her broom
harry reaches out for her
if you lay a hand on me ill hit you with this broom
annie im in love with you
theres a moon out tonight
as he pushes her through the kitchen door he slaps her fanny
the noise is cut off by the swinging door
george and his mother sit down at the table
boy oh boy oh boy my last meal at the old bailey boarding house
oh my lands my blood pressure
harry as he sticks his head through the kitchen door
pop can i have the car
im going to take over a lot of plates and things
oh mom im chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen
oh no you dont
harry now not my best haviland
she follows harry into the kitchen leaving pop and george
as she goes oh let him have the plates mother
george and his father eating at the table
there is a great similarity and a great understanding between them
hope you have a good trip george
uncle billy and i are going to miss you

harry and his mother come out of the kitchen harry carrying a pie in each hand and balancing one on his head
camera pans with them as they cross

george and pop at the table
annie comes in with some dishes
boys and girls and music
why do they need gin
father did i act like that when i graduated from high school
you know george wish we could send harry to college with you
your mother and i talked it over half the night
we have that all figured out
you see harryll take my job at the building and loan work there four years then hell go
hes pretty young for that job
well no younger than i was

oh well you know what ive always talked about build things
design new buildings plan modern cities all that stuff i was talking about
still after that first million before youre thirty
no ill settle for half that in cash
annie comes in again from the kitchen
of course its just a hope but you wouldnt consider coming back to the building and loan would you
annie stops serving to hear his answer
to annie annie why dont you draw up a chair
then youd be more comfortable and you could hear everything thats going on
i would if i thought id hear anything worth listening to
you would huh
she gives george a look and goes on out into the kitchen
bailey smiles and turns to george
i know its soon to talk about it
oh now pop i couldnt
i couldnt face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office
he stops realizing that he has hurt his father
oh im sorry pop
i didnt mean that remark but this business of nickels and dimes and spending all your life trying to figure out how to save three cents on a length of
id go crazy
i want to do something big and something important
quietly you know george i feel that in a small way we are doing something important
satisfying a fundamental urge
its deep in the race for a man to want his own roof and walls and fireplace and were helping him get those things in our shabby little office
unhappily i know dad
i wish i felt
but ive been hoarding pennies like a miser in order to
most of my friends have already finished college
i just feel like if i dont get away id bust
youre right son
you see what i mean dont you pop
this town is no place for any man unless hes willing to crawl to potter
youve got talent son
you get yourself an education
then get out of here
pop do you want a shock
i think youre a great guy
to cover his embarrassment he looks toward the kitchen door and calls oh did you hear that annie
annie listening through glass in door
i heard it
about time one of you lunkheads said it
george and his father at the table
im going to miss old annie
pop i think ill get dressed and go over to harrys party
have a good time son
at one end of the room an orchestra is playing
george wends his way through the dancing couples toward a supper table
he and harry are carrying plates and pies
here you are
several of the boys take the plates from him
george looks at them feeling very grown up and out of place
introducing george you know my kid brother george
im going to put him through college
sam wainwright comes in behind harry waggles his hands at his ears as he talks
here comes george
hello hee haw
george swings around delighted to hear a familiar voice
including sam and marty hatch
sam is assured and breezy wearing very collegiate clothes
how are you
when did you get here
oh this afternoon
i thought id give the kids a treat
old college graduate now huh
yeah old joe college wainwright they call me
well freshman looks like youre going to make it after all
sam sees harry and leaves george in the middle of a gesture
to harry harry
youre the guy i want to see
coach has heard all about you
hes followed every game and his mouths watering
he wants me to find out if youre going to come along with us
well i gotta make some dough first
well you better make it fast
we need great ends like you not broken down old guys like this one
george and sam wiggle their fingers at their ears saluting each other
an elderly fussy school principal comes over to george
george welcome back
partridge how are you
putting a pool under this floor was a great idea
saved us another building
now harry sam have a lot of fun
theres lots of stuff to eat and drink
lots of pretty girls around
violet bick comes into the scene and turns to face george
she is waving her dance program at him
hello what am i bid
marty hatch enters scene
well its old home week

well you remember my kid sister mary
oh yeah yeah

aw come on

just dance with her one time and youll give her the thrill of her life
aw go on
calling off hey sis
well excuse me violet

i dont want to be a wet nurse for
he stops suddenly as he sees mary staring at her
she is standing talking to one of the boys freddie a glass of punch in her hand
for the first time she is wearing an evening gown and she has gained assurance from the admiration of the boy with her
she turns around and for the first time she sees george
for a second she loses her poise staring at him
and the next thing i know some guy came up and tripped me
thats the reason why i came in fourth
if it hadnt been for that
george staring at mary
that race would have been a cinch
i tried to find out who it was later
still staring at george and smiling
but i couldnt find out
nobodyd ever tell you whoever it was because theyd be scared
mary and freddie
marty comes into scene followed by george
what kind of
interrupting you remember george
this is mary
well ill be seeing you
now to get back to my story see
mary hands her punch cup to freddie and she and george start dancing
hey this is my dance
oh why dont you stop annoying people
well im sorry
following george and mary as they dance
you look at me as if you didnt know me
well i dont
youve passed me on the street almost every day
that was a little girl named mary hatch
that wasnt you
a whistle is heard offscreen and the music stops
harry on the orchestra platform whistle in hand
oyez oyez oyez
the big charleston contest
a genuine loving cup
those not tapped by the judges will remain on the floor
as the music starts and couples begin dancing once more they look at each other
im not very good at this
neither am i
okay what can we lose
they start their charleston
we see a series of shots of various couples doing their routines some good some bad
leaning against the railing around the dance floor looking daggers at george
mickey a young punk who has had one too many is beside him
whats the matter othello jealous
did you know theres a swimming pool under this floor
and did you know that button behind you causes this floor to open up
and did you further know that george bailey is dancing right over that crack
and ive got the key
freddie needs no more
he takes the key from mickey and turns the switch
the floor begins to part in the middle each half sliding under the bleacher seats
dancers begin to scream as they try to get off
some are so engrossed in dancing they continue at top speed
teachers and elders start to scurry off
as the floor opens it reveals an attractive lighted swimming pool
george and mary are so busy dancing they dont notice the floor opening
spotlights concentrate on them
they mistake the screams for cheers
george and mary dancing
theyre cheering us
we must be good
the crowd watching george and mary dancing
they move backwards until finally they reach the edge of the floor and fall into the pool below
george and mary still trying to dance in the water the crowd on the edge cheering them some of the crowd leap into the pool the principal trying to restore
order finally clasps his hands like a diver and leaps in himself
george and mary
the night is warm with a bright moon
george is dressed in jersey sweater and oversize football pants that keep wanting to come down
mary is in an old white bath robe
each is carrying their wet clothes tied into a bundle that leaves a trail of dripping water
as they near the camera we hear them singing singing buffalo gals cant you come out tonight
cant you come out tonight
cant you come out tonight
buffalo gals cant you come out tonight and dance by the light of the moon
just like an organ
camera moves with them as they proceed down the street
and i told harry i thought id be bored to death
you should have seen the commotion in that locker room
i had to knock down three people to get this stuff were wearing here
here let me hold that old wet dress of yours
he takes the bundle of clothes from mary
they stop and look at each other
do i look as funny as you do
i guess im not quite the football type
you know if it wasnt me talking id say you were the prettiest girl in town
well why dont you say it
i dont know
maybe i will say it
how old are you anyway
why it was only last year you were seventeen
too young or too old
your age fits you
yes sir you look a little older without your clothes on
george to cover his embarrassment talks quickly on i mean without a dress
you look older
i mean younger
you look just
in his confusion george steps on the end of the belt of marys bath robe which is trailing along behind her
she gathers the robe around her
holding out her hand sir my train please
a pox upon me for a clumsy lout
he picks up the belt and throws it over her arm
your caboose my lady
you may kiss my hand
holding her hand george moves in closer to mary
hey hey mary
mary turns away from him singing buffalo gals singing as i was lumbering down the street
george looks after her then picks up a rock from the street
okay then ill throw a rock at the old granville house
oh no dont
i love that old house
it is a weather beaten old fashioned two storied house that once was no doubt resplendent
you see you make a wish and then try and break some glass
you got to be a pretty good shot nowadays too
oh no george dont
its full of romance that old place
id like to live in it
in that place
i wouldnt live in it as a ghost
right on the second floor there
george hurls the rock at the house
we hear the sound of a window breaking
we see a grumpy old man in shirt sleeves in a rocking chair on the porch
he looks up as he hears the breaking glass
whatd you wish george
well not just one wish
a whole hatful mary
i know what im going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that
im shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and im going to see the world
italy greece the parthenon the colosseum
then im coming back here and go to college and see what they know
and then im going to build things
im gonna build air fields
im gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high
im gonna build bridges a mile long
as he talks mary has been listening intently
she finally stoops down and picks up a rock weighting it in her hand
are you gonna throw a rock
the old deserted house
mary throws her rock and once more we hear the sound of breaking glass
hey thats pretty good
whatd you wish mary
mary looks at him provocatively then turns and shuffles off down the street singing as she goes
george hurries after her
singing buffalo gals cant you come out tonight
george joins her in the singing as they proceed down the street
singing cant you come out tonight cant you come out tonight
buffalo gals cant you come out tonight and dance by the light of the moon
whatd you wish when you threw that rock
man on the porch of house listening to george and mary
they have stopped walking and now face one another
come on tell me
if i told you it might not come true
what is it you want mary
what do you want
you want the moon
full moon shining through the trees
the word and ill throw a lasso around it and pull it down
hey thats a pretty good idea
ill give you the moon mary
ill take it
and then what
well then you could swallow it and itd all dissolve see
and the moonbeamsd shoot out of your fingers and your toes and the ends of your hair
pauses am i talking too much
as george finishes talking he jumps up out of his chair yes
why dont you kiss her instead of talking her to death
why dont you kiss her instead of talking her to death
want me to kiss her huh
aw youth is wasted on the wrong people
as he speaks the man leaves the porch and goes into his house slamming the front door
hey hey hold on
hey mister come on back out here and ill show you some kissing thatll put hair back on your head
what are you
mary runs off scene
george has been once more standing on the belt of her bath robe so as she goes her robe comes off
looking around mary
he drops his bundle of clothes and picks up marys robe
he cannot see her anywhere
okay i give up
where are you
we see marys face peering out from the leaves
over here in the hydrangea bushes
george walks toward the bush
here you are
he is about to throw her the robe when a thought strikes him
wait a minute
what am i doing
this is a very interesting situation
from the bushes please give me my robe
a man doesnt get in a situation like this every day
impatiently id like to have my robe
not in bedford falls anyway
mary thrashes around in the bushes
we hear her say ouch
this requires a little thought here
getting mad george bailey
give me my robe
ive heard about things like this but ive never
interrupting shame on you
im going to tell your mother on you
oh my mothers way up the corner there
desperate ill call the police
theyre way downtown
theyd be on my side too
im going to scream
thoughtfully maybe i could sell tickets
no the point is in order to get this robe
ive got it
ill make a deal with you mary
headlights flash into the scene and the old bailey automobile drives in with harry at the wheel and uncle billy beside him
come on home quick
your fathers had a stroke
george throws marys robe over the bush and gets into the car
mary im sorry
ive got to go
come on george lets hurry
did you get a doctor
yes campbells there now
as the car drives off mary now wearing the robe rises up from the bush and follows the car with her eyes
there are about twelve directors seated around a long table
they are the substantial citizens of bedford falls dr
campbell a lawyer an insurance agent a real estate salesman etc
prominently seated among them is henry f
potter his goon beside his wheelchair
uncle billy and george are seated among the directors
the chairman of the board is dr
they have folders and papers before them on which they have been reporting
before each of the directors there are individual reports for them to study
i think thats all well need you for george
i know youre anxious to make a train
rising i have a taxi waiting downstairs
i want the board to know that george gave up his trip to europe to help straighten things out here these past few months
good luck to you at school george
now we come to the real purpose of this meeting to appoint a successor to our dear friend peter bailey
chairman id like to get to my real purpose
wait just a minute now
wait for what
i claim this institution is not necessary to this town
chairman i make a motion to dissolve this institution and turn its assets and liabilities over to the receiver
angrily george you hear what that buzzard
chairman its too soon after peter baileys death to discuss chloroforming the building and loan
peter bailey died three months ago
i second mr
in that case ill ask the two executive officers to withdraw
campbell rises from his seat
george and uncle billy start to collect their papers and leave the table
but before you go im sure the whole board wishes to express its deep sorrow at the passing of peter bailey
thank you very much
it was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization
ill go further than that
ill say that to the public peter bailey was the building and loan
everyone looks at him surprised
trying to control himself oh thats fine potter coming from you considering that you probably drove him to his grave
peter bailey was not a business man
thats what killed him
oh i dont mean any disrespect to him god rest his soul
he was a man of high ideals so called but ideals without common sense can ruin this town
picking up papers from table now you take this loan here to ernie bishop
you know that fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his taxi
i happen to know the bank turned down this loan but he comes here and were building him a house worth five thousand dollars
george is at the door of the office holding his coat and papers ready to leave
well i handled that mr
you have all the papers there
his salary insurance
i can personally vouch for his character
sarcastically a friend of yours
you see if you shoot pool with some employee here you can come and borrow money
what does that get us
a discontented lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class
and all because a few starry eyed dreamers like peter bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas
now i say
george puts down his coat and comes around to the table incensed by what potter is saying about his father
just a minute just a minute
now hold on mr
youre right when you say my father was no business man
i know that
why he ever started this cheap penny ante building and loan ill never know
but neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character because his whole life was
why in the twenty five years since he and uncle billy started this thing he never once thought of himself
isnt that right uncle billy
he didnt save enough money to send harry to school let alone me
but he did help a few people get out of your slums mr
and whats wrong with that
here youre all businessmen here
doesnt it make them better citizens
doesnt it make them better customers
whatd you say just a minute ago
they had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home
wait for what
until their children grow up and leave them
until theyre so old and broken down that they
do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars
just remember this mr
potter that this rabble youre talking about
they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community
well is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath
anyway my father didnt think so
people were human beings to him but to you a warped frustrated old man theyre cattle
well in my book he died a much richer man than youll ever be
im not interested in your book
im talking about the building and loan
i know very well what youre talking about
youre talking about something you cant get your fingers on and its galling you
thats what youre talking about i know
to the board well ive said too much
youre the board here
you do what you want with this thing
just one thing more though
this town needs this measly one horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to potter
come on uncle billy
george leaves the room followed by the jubilant uncle billy
potters face is grim with hatred
the frustrated old man remark was gall in his veins
i want my motion
he is interrupted by a babble of talk as the directors take up the argument george visibly shaken is busy with his bag his papers
he is worried about the outcome of the meeting
dissolving the building and loan will alter his plans
uncle billy follows him around chattering
boy oh boy that was telling him george old boy
you shut his big mouth
to cousin tilly and cousin eustace you should have heard him
we heard a lot of yelling
well were being voted out of business after twenty five years
easy come easy go
reading a newspaper here it is help wanted female
ernie is in the doorway
you still want me to hang around george
looking at his watch yeah ill be right down
hey youll miss your train
youre a week late for school already
indicating board room i wonder whats going on in there
oh never mind
dont worry about that
theyre putting us out of business
i can get another job
im only fifty five
go on go on
hey look you gave up your boat trip now you dont want to miss college too do you
campbell comes running out all excited
they voted potter down
they want to keep it going
cousin eustace cousin tilly and uncle billy cheer wildly
campbell and george shake hands
but theyve got one condition only one condition
thats the best part of it
theyve appointed george here as executive secretary to take his fathers place
but uncle billy
you can keep him on
thats all right
as secretary you can hire anyone you like
campbell now lets get this thing straight
im leaving right now
im going to school
this is my last chance
uncle billy here hes your man
but george theyll vote with potter otherwise
the same stars we saw in the opening sequence are once more twinkling as we hear the voices form heaven i know
he didnt go
not only that but he gave his school money to his brother harry and sent him to college
harry became a football star made second team all american
yes but what happened to george
characteristic activity a number of people waiting for the train
uncle billy is seated on a baggage wagon eating peanuts as george paces up and down in front of him
george got four years older waiting for harry to come back and take over the building and loan
oh there are plenty of jobs around for somebody that likes to travel
look at this
takes some folders from his pocket there
venezuela oil fields wanted man with construction experience
heres the yukon right here wanted man with engineering experience
the whistle of the approaching train is heard
thar she blows
you know what the three most exciting sounds in the world are
breakfast is served lunch is served dinner
no no no no
anchor chains plane motors and train whistles
the train comes to a stop and harry is among the first to get off followed by an attractive girl about the same age as he is
george rushes into the shot and as the brothers embrace joyously theres the professor now
old professor phi beta kappa bailey
well if it isnt old george geographic explorer bailey
no husky dogs
to uncle billy uncle billy you havent changed a bit
nobody ever changes around here
you know that
oh am i glad to see you
say wheres mother
shes home cooking the fatted calf
come on lets go
wait a minute
the group including ruth dakin
this is the young lady who came off the train with harry
in the excitement of greetings she has been momentarily forgotten
she stands smiling waiting
how do you do
ruth dakin bailey if you dont mind
george and uncle billy stare astounded
well i wired you i had a surprise
here she is

george is thunderstruck
he takes ruths hand
well what do you know wife
well how do you do

he kisses ruth
camera moves with them down the platform
harry why didnt you tell somebody
to ruth whats a pretty girl like you doing marrying this two headed brother of mine
smiling well ill tell you
its purely mercenary
my father offered him a job
george stops with a sinking feeling
uncle billy and ruth continue out of shot
harry stops with george
as he moves off oh he gets you and a job
well harrys cup runneth over
about that job
ruth spoke out of turn
i never said id take it
youve been holding the bag here for four years and
well i wont let you down george
i would like to
oh wait a minute
i forgot the bags
ill be right back
he runs out of the shot george watching him
george slowly moves after uncle billy and ruth
he is thinking deeply
it was a surprise to me
this is the new mrs
bailey my nephews wife
old old friend of the family
oh of course
ive heard him speak of you
and i want to tell you were going to give the biggest party this town ever saw
camera moves with george as he comes into the scene
ruth detaches herself from the group and offers george some popcorn
to george here have some popcorn
george george george
thats all harry ever talks about
quietly ruth this
what about this job
oh well my father owns a glass factory in buffalo
he wants to get harry started in the research business
is it a good job
oh yes very
not much money but a good future you know
harrys a genius at research
my father fell in love with him
and you did too
ruth nods smiling
cousin eustace is taking a photograph of the family group assembled on the porch
flash bulbs go off and the group breaks up
the crowd enters the front door of the house leaving george and uncle billy on the porch
the latter is tipsy
he feels very high
oh boy oh boy oh boy
i feel so good i could spit in potters eye
i think i will
what did you say huh
oh maybe id better go home
he looks around for his hat which is on his head
wheres my hat
george takes the hat from uncle billys head and hands it to him
oh thank you george
which one is mine
laughing the middle one
oh thank you george old boy old boy
now look if youll point me in the right direction
would you do that
right down here
they descend the porch steps and george turns his uncle around and heads him down the street
old building and loan pal huh
now you just turn this way and go right straight down
that way huh
he staggers out of the scene and as george turns away we hear uncle billy singing my wild irish rose
there is a crash of cans and bottles then im all right
im all right
the sweetest flower that grows
george is standing at the garden gate
he takes some travel folders from his pocket looks at them and throws them away
he is obviously disturbed about the latest turn of events
his mother comes out of the house and kisses him
as she kisses him thats for nothing
how do you like her
she nods toward the house where harry and ruth among a crowd of other couples are dancing to the music of a phonograph and can be seen through the front
looks like she can keep harry on his toes
keep him out of bedford falls anyway
did you know that mary hatch is back from school
came back three days ago
nice girl mary
kind that will help you find the answers george
oh stop that grunting
can you give me one good reason why you shouldnt call on mary

and besides sam wainwrights away in new york and youre here in bedford falls

trying to get rid of me huh
bailey puts georges hat on his head
well heres your hat whats your hurry
all right mother old building and loan pal i think ill go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking
now if youll just point me in the right direction
as he leaves good night mrs
george is standing in the middle of the street hands in his pockets
as a girl passes he turns and watches her for a moment
he is obviously undecided as to what he wants to do
violet is locking up for the night
a couple of men are crowding around her each one bent on taking her out
there is laughter kidding and pawing
she looks up and sees george standing there
to the two men excuse me
now wait a minute
i think i got a date
but stick around fellows just in case huh
well wait for you baby
camera pans with violet as she crosses the street to george
hello georgie porgie
he looks her over
violet takes her beauty shop seriously and shes an eyeful
she senses the fact that george is far from immune to her attractions
she links her arm in his and continues on down the street with him
where are you going
oh ill probably end up down at the library
they stop walking and face one another
george dont you ever get tired of just reading about things
her eyes are seductive and guileful as she looks up at him
he is silent for a moment then blurts out yes
what are you doing tonight
feigned surprise not a thing
are you game vi
lets make a night of it
just what she wanted oh id love it georgie
whatll we do
lets go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass
then we can go up to the falls
its beautiful up there in the moonlight and theres a green pool up there and we can swim in it
then we can climb mt
bedford and smell the pines and watch the sunrise against the peaks and
well stay up there the whole night and everybodyll be talking and therell be a terrific scandal
interrupting george have you gone crazy
walk in the grass in my bare feet
why its ten miles up to mt
angrily you think just because you
by this time a small crowd has collected to watch the above scene
violet is furious and talking in a loud voice and george is trying to quiet her
finally okay just forget about the whole thing
as george stalks off the crowd breaks into laughter and we george is walking slowly past the hatch home
he stares meditatively at the simple dwelling then he starts walking ahead
but after a few steps he turns around and starts back
he walks past the house a few yards turns and starts back again
mary is looking out the window watching george walk back and forth
what are you doing picketing
george stops startled and looks up
i just happened to be passing by
yeah so i noticed
have you made up your mind
have you made up your mind
about coming in
your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit
george looks surprised at this
my mother just called you
well how did she know
didnt you tell her
i didnt tell anybody
i just went for a walk and happened to be passing by
but mary has disappeared from the window
to himself what do you
went for a walk thats all
mary is running down the stairs
calling off ill be downstairs mother
all right dear
mary looks in a mirror at the bottom of the stairs and fixes her hair
she is plainly excited at georges visit
she runs into the parlor and puts a sketch on an easel
it is a caricature of george throwing a lasso around the moon
lettering on the drawing says george lassos the moon
mary runs into the hall opens the phonograph and puts on a record of buffalo gals
then she opens the front door and stands there waiting for george
george is struggling with the gate he finally kicks it open and starts slowly up the path toward mary
well are you coming in or arent you
well ill come in for a minute but i didnt tell anybody i was coming over here
mary and george are in the entrance hall
when did you get back
whered you get that dress
do you like it
its all right
i thought youd go back to new york like sam and ingie and the rest of them
oh i worked there for a couple of vacations but i dont know
i guess i was homesick
for bedford falls
yes and my family and
would you like to sit down
they go through the doorway into the parlor
all right for a minute
i still cant understand it though
you know i didnt tell anybody i was coming here
would you rather leave
no i dont want to be rude
well then sit down
george sees the cartoon on the easel and bends down for a close look at it
indicating cartoon some joke huh
george and mary sitting on the divan
he is uncomfortable and she tries desperately to keep the conversation alive
well i see it still smells like pine needles in here
there is silence for a moment then mary joins in singing with the phonograph record which has been playing all through the above scene singing and dance by the light
whats the matter
he looks at his watch as though about to leave
desperately it was nice about your brother harry and ruth wasnt it
thats all right
dont you like her
well of course i like her
shes a peach
oh its just marriage in general youre not enthusiastic about huh
no marriage is all right for harry and marty and sam and you
hatch in a bathrobe and with her hair in curlers is leaning over the banister as she calls mary
george and mary seated on the divan
whos down there with you
its george bailey mother
whats he want
i dont know
to george what do you want
not a thing
i just came in to get warm
to mother hes making violent love to me mother
george is aghast

sam wainwright promised to call you from new york tonight

i dont know
you tell me
youre supposed to be the one that has all the answers
you tell me
terribly hurt oh why dont you go home
almost shouting thats where im going
i dont know why i came here in the first place
as george leaves the room the telephone in the hall starts ringing
to george good night
mary comes into the hall
almost weeping ill get it
as mary comes into the hall she stops by the phonograph which is still playing buffalo gals takes off the record with a jerk and smashes it against the machine
the phone is still ringing
mary hes waiting
as mary picks up the phone george comes in from the front porch
i forgot my hat
overly enthusiastic hee haw
hello sam how are you
gee its good to hear your voice again
george has stopped hat in hand to hear the first greetings
oh well thats awfully sweet of you sam
glances toward door sees george still there theres an old friend of yours here

yes old moss back george
put him on
wait a minute
ill call him
he doesnt want to speak to george you idiot
he does so
he asked for him
george sam wants to speak to you
she hands the instrument to george
sam is seated at his desk while a couple of his friends are nearby with highballs in their hands
into phone well george baileyoffski

nobodys trying to steal your girl
no wait a minute
wait a minute
i want to talk to both of you

to mary here
you take it
you tell him
mothers on the extension
as she hears this she hastily hangs up the extension phone on which she has been listening
we can both hear
mary takes the telephone from george and holds it so that of necessity georges cheek is almost against hers
he is very conscious of her proximity
on phone were listening sam
i have a big deal coming up thats going to make us all rich
george you remember that night in martinis bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans
yeah yeah yeah
well dads snapped up the idea

how do you like that
mary is watching george interestedly
george is very conscious of her close to him
well why rochester
well why not
can you think of anything better
oh i dont know
why not right here
you remember that old tool and machinery works
you tell your father he can get that for a song
and all the labor he wants too
half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down
well ill tell him
hey that sounds great
oh baby i knew youd come through

well now listen
i want you to put every cent youve got into our stock you hear
and george i may have a job for you that is unless youre still married to that broken down building and loan
this is the biggest thing since radio and im letting you in on the ground floor
nervously im here
would you tell that guy im giving him the chance of a lifetime you hear
the chance of a lifetime
as mary listens she turns to look at george her lips almost on his lips
whispering he says its the chance of a lifetime
george can stand it no longer
he drops the phone with a crash grabs mary by the shoulders and shakes her
mary begins to cry
fiercely now you listen to me
i dont want any plastics
i dont want any ground floors and i dont want to get married ever to anyone
you understand that
i want to do what i want to do
he pulls her to him in a fierce embrace
two meant for each other find themselves in tearful ecstasy
hatch is at the top of the stairs
she practically faints at what she sees
cousin tillys face fills the screen as she cries here they come
camera pulls back and we hear the sound of the wedding march
people are crowded into the rooms family friends neighbors
there is a din of conversation
mary and george appear at the top of the stairs in traveling clothes with mrs
hatch red eyed behind them
mary throws her bouquet which is caught by violet bick
as they come out onto the porch we see that it is raining
nevertheless cousin eustace has his camera equipment set up and is taking pictures of the group
george and mary dodge through the rain and a shower of rice and get into ernies taxicab which pulls away from the curb
bailey and annie the maid
first harry now george
annie were just two old maids now
you speak for yourself mrs
george and mary are in each others arms
if either of you two see a stranger around here its me
somebodys driving this cab
ernie reaches over and hands george a bottle of champagne done up in gift wrappings
bert the cop sent this over
he said to float away to happy land on the bubbles
oh look at this
good old bert
by the way where are you two going on this here now honeymoon
where are we going
takes out a fat roll of bills look at this
theres the kitty ernie
here come on count it mary
i feel like a bootleggers wife
holding up the money look

a whole week in new york
a whole week in bermuda
the highest hotels the oldest champagne the richest caviar the hottest music and the prettiest wife
that does it
to mary then what honey
after that who cares
that does it come here
the cab passes the bank and ernie sees a crowd of people around the door
he stops the cab
scurrying people under umbrellas swarming around the bank doors
panic is in the air
attendants are trying to close down
several people come running past the cab
dont look now but theres something funny going on over there at the bank george ive never really seen one but thats got all the earmarks of a run
hey ernie if you got any money in the bank you better hurry
george lets not stop
george gets out of the cab and looks down the street
just a minute dear
please lets not stop george
ill be back in a minute mary
george runs off up the street toward the building and loan
an iron grill blocks the street entrance to the building and loan
it has been locked
a crowd of men and women are waiting around the grill
they are simply dressed people to whom their savings are a matter of life and death
george comes in with an assumed cheerful manner
the people look at him silently half shamefaced but grimly determined on their rights
in their hearts there is panic and fear
thompson how are you
whats the matter here cant you get in
no one answers
he quickly unlocks the grill door and pushes it open
followed by the crowd george runs upstairs and into the outer offices of the building and loan
george followed by the still silent people comes in
uncle billy is standing in the doorway to his private office taking a drink from a bottle
he motions to george to join him
what is this uncle billy
he points to georges office
george turns back cheerfully to the crowd
come on in everybody
thats right just come in
george vaults over the counter
now look why dont you all sit down
there are a lot of seats over there
just make yourselves at home
george can i see you a minute
the people ignore george and remain standing in front of the tellers window
they all have their passbooks out
george hurries into his office where uncle billy is waiting for him
why didnt you call me
i just did but they said you left
this is a pickle george this is a pickle
all right now what happened
how did it start
how does anything like this ever start
all i know is the bank called our loan
about an hour ago
i had to hand over all our cash
all of it
every cent of it and it still was less than we owe
and then i got scared george and closed the doors
the whole towns gone crazy
the telephone rings
uncle billy picks it up
potter seated behind his desk his goon alongside him
standing in front of the desk is a distinguished looking man obviously the president of the bank
he is mopping his brow with his handkerchief
george there is a rumor around town that youve closed your doors
is that true
oh well im very glad to hear that
george are you all right
do you need any police
on phone police
well mobs get pretty ugly sometimes you know
george im going all out to help in this crisis
ive just guaranteed the bank sufficient funds to meet their needs
theyll close up for a week and then reopen
to uncle billy he just took over the bank
i may lose a fortune but im willing to guarantee your people too
just tell them to bring their shares over here and i will pay them fifty cents on the dollar
furiously aw you never miss a trick do you potter
well youre going to miss this one
george bangs the receiver down and turns to meet uncle billys anxious look
if you close your doors before six p
you will never reopen
he realizes george has hung up and clicks the phone furiously
george was it a nice wedding
gosh i wanted to be there
looks at string on uncle billys finger you can take this one off now
an ominous sound of angry voices comes from the other room
george and uncle billy exit from georges office
more people have crowded around the counter
their muttering stops and they stand silent and grim
there is panic in their faces
now just remember that this thing isnt as black as it appears
as george speaks sirens are heard passing in the street below
the crowd turn to the windows then back to george
i have some news for you folks
ive just talked to old man potter and hes guaranteed cash payments at the bank
the banks going to reopen next week
but george i got my money here
did he guarantee this place
well no charlie
i didnt even ask him
we dont need potter over here
mary and ernie have come into the room during this scene
mary stands watching silently
ill take mine now
no but you
youre thinking of this place all wrong
as if i had the money back in a safe
the moneys not here
your moneys in joes house
to one of the men right next to yours
and in the kennedy house and mrs
macklins house and a hundred others
why youre lending them the money to build and then theyre going to pay it back to you as best they can
now what are you going to do
foreclose on them
i got two hundred and forty two dollars in here and two hundred and forty two dollars isnt going to break anybody
handing him a slip okay tom
here you are
you sign this
youll get your money in sixty days
well now thats what you agreed to when you bought your shares
there is a commotion at the outer doors
a man randall comes in and makes his way up to tom
tom did you get your money
well i did
old man potterll pay fifty cents on the dollar for every share you got
shows bills ad lib fifty cents on the dollar
to george well what do you say
now tom you have to stick to your original agreement
now give us sixty days on this
turning to randall okay randall
he starts out
are you going to go to potters
better to get half than nothing
a few other people start for the door
camera pans with george as he vaults over the counter quickly speaking to the people
now listen to me
i beg of you not to do this thing
if potter gets hold of this building and loan therell never be another decent house built in this town
hes already got charge of the bank
hes got the bus line
hes got the department stores
and now hes after us
well its very simple
because were cutting in on his business thats why
and because he wants to keep you living in his slums and paying the kind of rent he decides
the people are still trying to get out but some of them have stood still listening to him
george has begun to make an impression on them
joe you lived in one of his houses didnt you
well have you forgotten
have you forgotten what he charged you for that broken down shack
to ed here ed
you know you remember last year when things werent going so well and you couldnt make your payments
you didnt lose your house did you
do you think potter would have let you keep it
turns to address the room again cant you understand whats happening here
dont you see whats happening
potter isnt selling
because were panicky and hes not
hes picking up some bargains
now we can get through this thing all right
weve got to stick together though
weve got to have faith in each other
but my husband hasnt worked in over a year and i need money
how am i going to live until the bank opens
i got doctor bills to pay
i need cash
cant feed my kids on faith
during this scene mary has come up behind the counter
suddenly as the people once more start moving toward the door she holds up a roll of bills and calls out how much do you need
george jumps over the counter and takes the money from mary

george uncle billy and cousin tilly are behind the counter watching the minute hand of a clock on the wall as george counts off the seconds
cousin eustace is ready to close the door

cousin eustace slams and locks the door and scurries around the counter to join the others

as george comes out handing out cigars wedding cigars

whose home is that
the waldorf hotel huh
an old fashioned run down house unpainted and warped by the weather
it once had class but has not been lived in for years
this is the house that george and mary will live in from now on
the rain is pouring down
a faint glow of light shines out from bottom windows
george hurries into scene
he stops to make sure it is the right number before going up the steps
bert and man working in rain sorting through travel posters
hey this is the companys posters and the company wont like this
how would you like to get a ticket next week
havent you any romance in you

reading poster liver pills

places george wants to go
a sharp whistle is heard
ernie is leaning from the window
hey bert here he comes

the groom idiot

disgustedly what are they ducks
bert and the man are putting up travel posters to cover up the broken windows
get that ladder up here
all right all right
george is approaching the front door of the house on which a sign is hanging bridal suite
ernie looks out through the curtain covering the broken glass of the front door
good evening sir
ernie opens the door revealing himself as a homemade butler
this has been accomplished by rolling up his pants and putting on an old coachmans hat
entray monsieur entray
the house is carpetless empty the rain and wind cause funny noises upstairs
a huge fire is burning in the fireplace
near the fireplace a collection of packing boxes are heaped together in the shape of a small table and covered with a checkered oil cloth
it is set for two
a bucket with ice and a champagne bottle sit on the table as well as a bowl of caviar
two small chickens are impaled on a spit over the fire
a phonograph is playing on a box and a string from the phonograph is turning the chickens on the spit
the phonograph is playing song of the islands
mary is standing near the fireplace looking as pretty as any bride ever looked
she is smiling at george who has been slowly taking in the whole set up
through a door he sees the end of a cheap bed over the back of which is a pair of pajamas and a nightie
ernie exits and closes the door
tears in her eyes welcome home mr
overcome well ill be
mary mary where did you
they rush into each others arms and hold each other in ecstasy
bert and ernie standing in the pouring rain start singing i love you truly
they remain embraced
remember the night we broke the windows in this old house
this is what i wished for
darling youre wonderful
they finish their song and ernie kisses bert on the forehead
bert slams ernies hat on his head
in front of one of the miserable shacks that line the street are two vehicles
one of them is george baileys rickety car and the other is an even more rickety truck piled high with household goods
the martini family is moving
the family consists of martini his wife and four kid of various ages from two to ten
george and mary are helping the martinis move
about a dozen neighbors crowd around
martini and george assisted by three of the martini children are carrying out the last of the furniture
as they emerge from the house one of the neighbors schultz calls out martini you rented a new house

the family goat gets in the back seat with the three kids
the rickety caravan starts off down the street to the cheers of the neighbors
sign hanging from a tree welcome to bailey park
camera pans to follow georges car and the old truck laden with furniture as they pass we hear martinis voice singing o sole mio
bailey park is a district of new small houses not all alike but each individual
new lawns here and there and young trees
it has the promise when built up of being a pleasant little middle class section
george and mary are on the porch of the new house with the martinis lined up before them
martini welcome home
the martinis cross themselves
sam wainwright is standing in front of his big black town car
sam is the epitome of successful up and coming businessman
his wife in the car is a very attractive sophisticated looking lady dripping with furs and jewels
sam is watching george across the street
that old george
hes always making a speech
to george hee haw
wiggles his hands to mary sam wainwright
oh who cares
martini giving her loaf of bread bread
that this house may never know hunger
martini crosses herself
giving her salt salt
that life may always have flavor
handing bottle to martini and wine
that joy and prosperity may reign forever
enter the martini castle
the martinis cross themselves shaking hands all around
the kids enter with screams of delight
martini kisses mary
potter seated in his wheelchair at his desk with his goon beside him
his rent collector reineman is talking pointing to maps spread out on the desk
potter its no skin off my nose
im just your little rent collector
but you cant laugh off this bailey park any more
look at it
a buzzer is heard and potter snaps on the dictaphone on his desk
congressman blatz is here to see you
to dictaphone oh tell the congressman to wait
to reineman go on
fifteen years ago a half dozen houses stuck here and there
indicating map theres the old cemetery squirrels buttercups daisies
used to hunt rabbits there myself
look at it today
dozens of the prettiest little homes you ever saw
ninety per cent owned by suckers who used to pay rent to you
your potters field my dear mr
employer is becoming just that
and are the local yokels making with those david and goliath wisecracks
oh they are are they
even though they know the baileys havent made a dime out of it
you know very well why
the baileys were all chumps
every one of these homes is worth twice what it cost the building and loan to build
if i were you mr
interrupting well you are not me
as he leaves as i say its no skin off my nose
but one of these days this bright young man is going to be asking george bailey for a job
the bailey family has been a boil on my neck long enough
he flips the switch on the dictaphone
come in here
george and mary are talking to sam wainwright in front of the latters car
hs wife jane is now out of the car
we just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory and then were going to drive on down to florida
why dont you have your friends join us
hey why dont you kids drive down with us huh
oh im afraid i couldnt get away sam
still got the nose to the old grindstone eh
jane i offered to let george in on the ground floor in plastics and he turned me down cold
oh now dont rub it in
im not rubbing it in
well i guess we better run along
there is handshaking all around as sam and jane get into their car
awfully glad to have met you mary
nice meeting you
so long george
see you in the funny papers
thanks for dropping around
to chauffeur to florida
to george hee haw
the big black limousine glides away leaving george standing with his arm around mary gazing broodingly after it
they slowly walk over to georges old car and look at it silently
potter is lighting a big cigar which he has just given george
the goon is beside potters chair as usual
thank you sir
quite a cigar mr
you like it
ill send you a box
nervously well i
i suppose ill find out sooner or later but just what exactly did you want to see me about
laughs george now thats just what i like so much about you
pleasantly and smoothly george im an old man and most people hate me
but i dont like them either so that makes it all even
you know just as well as i do that i run practically everything in this town but the bailey building and loan
you know also that for a number of years ive been trying to get control of it
or kill it
but i havent been able to do it
you have been stopping me
in fact you have beaten me george and as anyone in this county can tell you that takes some doing
take during the depression for instance
you and i were the only ones that kept our heads
you saved the building and loan and i saved all the rest
well most people say you stole all the rest
the envious ones say that george the suckers
now i have stated my side very frankly
now lets look at your side
young man twenty seven twenty eight
married making say
forty a week
indignantly forty five
out of which after supporting your mother and paying your bills youre able to keep say ten if you skimp
a child or two comes along and you wont even be able to save the ten
now if this young man of twenty eight was a common ordinary yokel id say he was doing fine
but george bailey is not a common ordinary yokel
hes an intelligent smart ambitious young man who hates his job who hates the building and loan almost as much as i do
a young man whos been dying to get out on his own ever since he was born
a young man
the smartest one of the crowd mind you a young man who has to sit by and watch his friends go places because hes trapped
yes sir trapped into frittering his life away playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic eaters
do i paint a correct picture or do i exaggerate
mystified now whats your point mr
my point is i want to hire you
dumbfounded hire me
i want you to manage my affairs run my properties
george ill start you out at twenty thousand dollars a year
george drops his cigar on his lap
he nervously brushes off the sparks from his clothes
flabbergasted twenty thou
twenty thousand dollars a year
you wouldnt mind living in the nicest house in town buying your wife a lot of fine clothes a couple of business trips to new york a year maybe once
in a while europe
you wouldnt mind that would you george
looking around skeptically youre not talking to somebody else around here are you
you know this is me you remember me
oh yes george bailey
whose ship has just come in providing he has brains enough to climb aboard
well what about the building and loan
oh confound it man are you afraid of success
im offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year starting today
is it a deal or isnt it
i know i ought to jump at the chance but i
i wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty four hours to think it over
sure sure sure
you go on home and talk about it to your wife
id like to do that
in the meantime ill draw up the papers
all right sir
offers hand okay george
taking his hand okay mr
as they shake hands george feels a physical revulsion
potters hand feels like a cold mackerel to him
in that moment of physical contact he knows he could never be associated with this man
george drops his hand with a shudder
he peers intently into potters face
no now wait a minute here
i dont have to talk to anybody
i know right now and the answer is no
getting madder all the time you sit around here and you spin your little webs and you think the whole world revolves around you and your money
well it doesnt mr
in the whole vast configuration of things id say you were nothing but a scurvy little spider
he turns and shouts at the goon impassive as ever beside potters wheelchair
and that goes for you too
as george opens the office door to exit he shouts at mr
potters secretary in the outer office and it goes for you too
the room is modestly furnished with just a cheap bed a chair or two and a dresser
mary is asleep in the bed
as george comes in his head is filled with many confusing thoughts relating to incidents in his past life
you wouldnt mind living in the nicest house in town
buying your wife a lot of fine clothes going to new york on a business trip a couple of times a year
maybe to europe once in a while
george takes off his hat and coat moves over to the dresser and stares at his reflection in the mirror
i know what im going to do tomorrow and the next day and next year and the year after that
im shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and im going to see the world
and im going to build things
im going to build air fields
im going to build skyscrapers a hundred stories high
im going to build a bridge a mile long
while the above thoughts are passing through georges head his attention is caught by a picture on the wall near the dresser it is the sketch of george lassoing the
moon that we first saw in marys living room
the lettering reads george lassos the moon
what is it you want mary
you want the moon
if you do just say the word ill throw a lasso around it and pull it down for you
mary is now awake and starts singing their theme song singing buffalo gals wont you come out tonight wont you come out tonight wont you come out tonight
george crosses over and sits on the edge of the bed
mary hatch why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me
to keep from being an old maid
you could have married sam wainwright or anybody else in town
i didnt want to marry anybody else in town
i want my baby to look like you
you didnt even have a honeymoon
i promised you
does a double take your what
incredulously you mean
mary you on the nest
george bailey lassos stork
lassos the stork
you mean you
what is it a boy or a girl
mary nods her head happily
over the following series of shots we hear the voices of joseph and clarence in heaven
george is crossing the street heading for the offices of the building and loan
now youve probably already guessed that george never leaves bedford falls
mary had her baby a boy
mary sitting on the floor playing with a baby
a little boy is in a playpen nearby
then she had another one a girl
mary is busy hanging wallpaper and painting the old place
day after day she worked away remaking the old granville house into a home
george has just come into the hall
he is obviously tired and discouraged as he starts up the stairs
the knob on the banister comes off in his hand
night after night george came back late from the office
potter was bearing down hard
a group of men obviously just drafted marching along in a camp
then came a war
bailey and other women in red cross uniforms busily sewing etc
ma bailey and mrs
hatch joined the red cross and sewed
mary with portable u
pushcart is serving coffee and doughnuts to men leaning from the train
mary had two more babies but still found time to run the u
sam wainwright showing set of blueprints to two army officers
sam wainwright made a fortune in plastic hoods for planes
potter is wheeled in toward a long table around which several men are seated
potter became head of the draft board
reading from papers one a
gower and uncle billy are conducting a bond rally from the top of an army tank
gower and uncle billy sold war bonds
bert in uniform moving cautiously with fixed bayonet
smoke and flashes of gunfire in background

hundreds of planes flying overhead with parachutes dropping from them
ernie the taxi driver parachuted into france
marty in the foreground beckoning to soldiers to come on

george in the uniform of an air raid warden is patrolling his beat
air raid warden
man beside lighted window pulls down the shade as george blows his whistle
george is helping load his old car with scrap paper
wheelbarrow full of junk being dumped onto pile
like everybody else on v e day he wept and prayed
on v j day he wept and prayed again
joseph now show him what happened today
george is walking along the sidewalk reading a newspaper
it is a raw gusty day and his overcoat and muffler flap in the breeze
draped around one arm is a large christmas wreath
under his other arm are several more copies of the paper
this morning day before christmas about ten a
bedford falls time
george comes to where ernie the taxi driver is standing on the sidewalk
holding out paper hi ernie look at that
the front page of the paper the bedford falls sentinel
the headline reads president decorates harry bailey local boy wins congressional medal of honor
the subhead tells of a plan for a giant jubilee and parade to be followed by a banquet in honor of commander harry bailey u
on his way home from washington after receiving the congressional medal of honor
theres a large picture of president truman pinning the coveted medal on harrys bosom in the midst of dignitaries a picture of the transport which harry saved
practically the whole front page is devoted to the story

gower comes running across the street from his drugstore and joins them
reading commander harry bailey
gower look at this the second page

as he leaves see you again
uncle billy is walking along the street humming happily to himself
he sees some men decorating the court house with banners and bunting there is a huge sign reading welcome home harry bailey calls out be sure you spell the name
the offices are unchanged still small time and old fashioned
the same office force albeit a few years older cousin tilly and cousin eustace
seated on a chair is a middle aged man with a brief case
the outer door opens and george enters extra

uncle billy is filling out a deposit slip at one of the desks
writing december twenty fourth
he takes a thick envelope from his inside pocket and thumbs through the bills it contains
it is evidently a large sum of money
potter is being wheeled in by his goon
various bank officials run over to greet him he is reading a newspaper
uncle billy has finished filling out his slip and comes over to taunt potter the envelope containing the money in his hand
well good morning mr
whats the news
he grabs the paper from potters hand
well well well harry bailey wins congressional medal
that couldnt be one of the bailey boys
you just cant keep those baileys down now can you mr
how does slacker george feel about that
very jealous very jealous
he only lost three buttons off his vest
of course slacker george would have gotten two of those medals if he had gone
uncle billy folds potters paper over the envelope containing his money and flings his final taunt at the old man
after all potter some people like george had to stay home
not every heel was in germany and japan
in a cold rage potter grabs his paper and wheels off toward his office
uncle billy smiles triumphantly and goes toward deposit window with his deposit slip
uncle billy and bank teller at the window
still chuckling good morning horace
uncle billy hands the bank book over
the teller opens it starts to punch it with rubber stamps
i guess you forgot something
you forgot something
well arent you going to make a deposit
sure sure i am
its usually customary to bring the money with you
uncle billy searches through every pocket he has
looks bewildered i know i had
the teller knowing the old mans vagaries points to one of the numerous string tied around his fingers
how about that one there
potter is now behind his desk
he spreads the newspaper out in front of him muttering as he does so
he sees the envelope looks inside at the money
then to his goon indicating the office door take me back there
as they go come on look sharp
potter opens the door just a little and peers through into the bank
uncle billy looks around for the money envelope
it is not there
he looks puzzled thinks hard then a look of concern creeps into his eyes
he starts thumping his pockets with increasing panic and looks in the waste paper basket on the floor
he finally rushes through the door and out into the street
to goon take me back
the goon wheels him back to his desk
he is deep in thought with a crafty expression on his face
uncle billy running across the street in the direction of the building and loan
george coming from room where he has just left the bank examiner
just make yourself at home mr
ill get those books for you
he sees violet bick standing there
oh hello vi

uncle billy talk to harry

uncle billy picks up the phone and speaks distractedly without knowing what he is saying
on phone hello

he hangs up agitatedly muttering to himself as he goes into his own office
cousin tilly and cousin eustace look after him dumbfounded
i should have my head examined
eight thousand dollars

george has just finished writing something and is slipping the paper into an envelope
hands it to her here you are

it takes a lot of character to leave your home town and start all over again
he pulls some money from his pocket and offers it to her

she looks at him then says a strange thing

she reaches up and kisses him on the cheek leaving lipstick
george opens the door for her
as george and violet come through the door they are being watched by cousin tilly cousin eustace and the bank examiner who is still waiting to go to work on

violet sees the lipstick on georges cheek and dabs at it with her handkerchief
whats the matter

carter im sorry

as george opens the door he sees uncle billy frantically looking for the missing envelope
the office is in a mess drawers are opened and papers scattered on the floor and on the desk
whats going on
the bank examiners here and i
in dismay hes here
he wants the accounts payable
george stops short suddenly aware of the tragic old eyes looking up at him
whats the matter with you
uncle billy gestures nervously for george to come in
he does so and closes the door
cousin tilly is at her switchboard and cousin eustace standing beside her
carter is still waiting in the doorway to his office
suddenly the door opens and george comes striding out
he goes directly to the safe and starts searching but doesnt find the money
then he goes to the cash drawer in the counter and looks through it
come here a minute
cousin eustace runs over to george
did you see uncle billy with any cash last night
he had it on his desk counting it before he closed up
uncle billy and george are retracing the formers steps through the snow looking everywhere for the missing money
they pause for a moment on the sidewalk
now look did you buy anything
not even a stick of gum
now well go over every step you took since you left the house
they continue on down the street on their search
potter is peering through the slats of the venetian blind watching them as they go
george and uncle billy continue their search
a shabby old fashioned gas lit room which has been turned almost inside out and upside down in an effort to locate the missing money
drawers of an old secretary have been pulled out and are on the floor
every conceivable place which might have been used by uncle billy to put the money has been searched
george his hair rumpled is feverishly pursuing the search
uncle billy is seated behind the desk his head on his hands
and did you put the envelope in your pocket
shouts maybe maybe
i dont want any maybe
uncle billy weve got to find that money
piteously im no good to you george
listen to me
do you have any secret hiding place here in the house
someplace you could have put it
someplace to hide the money
exhausted ive been over the whole house even in rooms that have been locked ever since i lost laura
uncle billy starts sobbing hysterically
george grabs him by the lapels and shakes him
harshly listen to me
listen to me
sobbing i cant think any more george
i cant think any more
george jerks him to his feet and shakes him
uncle billy stands before him like a frisked criminal all his pockets hanging out empty
georges eyes and manner are almost maniacal
screaming at him wheres that money you stupid silly old fool
wheres the money
do you realize what this means
it means bankruptcy and scandal and prison
he throws uncle billy down into his chair and still shouts at him thats what it means
one of us is going to jail
well its not going to be me
george turns and heads for the door kicking viciously at a waste basket on the floor as he goes
uncle billy remains sobbing at the table his head in his arms
janie aged eight is seated at the piano playing hark the herald angels sing which she practices during the remainder of this scene
there is a christmas tree all decorated near the fireplace
at a large table mary is busy putting cellophane bows and decorations on gift packages
at a small table pete aged nine is seated with pad and pencil in the throes of composition
on the floor tommy aged three is playing with a toy vacuum cleaner
we hear the sound of a door open and close
mary turns and sees george enter the hall a slight powdering of snow on his head and shoulders
as george comes into the house
hello daddy hello daddy
indicating tree how do you like it
george sneezes violently
did you bring the wreath
did you bring the christmas wreath
the merry christmas wreath for the window
i left it at the office

mary stares at him aware that something unusual has happened
whats the matter
bitterly nothings the matter

george slumps into an armchair and lifts tommy onto his lap
mary is helping pete decorate the christmas tree

during this scene george has been sitting in the chair hugging tommy to him and crying quietly
mary realizes that something is seriously wrong and breaks off
janie is thumping away at the piano

why did we have to live here in the first place and stay around this measly crummy old town
worried george whats wrong
you call this a happy family
why did we have to have all these kids
coming in dad how do you spell frankincense
shouts i dont know
ask your mother
george goes toward doorway
wherere you going
going up to see zuzu
we hear his footsteps as he leaves
mary looks after him puzzled and concerned then comes over to pete
he told me to write a play for tonight
the knob on the banister comes off in his hand and for a moment he has an impulse to hurl it into the living room
then he replaces the knob and goes on up the stairs
the sound of janie at the piano can be heard the same monotonous rhythm over and over
zuzu aged six is sitting up in her bed the lamp burning beside her
she is holding her prize flower
george tiptoes in
then as he sees shes awake he comes over sitting on the edge of her bed
well what happened to you
i won a flower
she starts to get out of bed
where do you think youre going
want to give my flower a drink
all right all right
here give daddy the flower
ill give it a drink
she shakes her head and presses the flower to her
a few petals fall off
she picks them up
yeah all right
now ill paste this together
she hands him the fallen petals and the flower
he turns his back to zuzu pretending to be tinkering with the flower
he sticks the fallen petals in his watch pocket rearranges the flower and then turns back to zuzu
there it is good as new
give the flower a drink
george puts the flower in a glass of water on the table beside her bed
now will you do something for me
will you try to get some sleep
im not sleepy
i want to look at my flower
i know i know but you just go to sleep and then you can dream about it and itll be a whole garden
she closes her eyes and relaxes on the bed
george pulls the covers over her
he bends down and his lips touch a tendril of the childs hair
then he gets up and tiptoes out of the room
janie is still pounding with grim determination at the piano
pete is seated at the table writing
tommy is playing with his toy vacuum cleaner
the telephone rings
mary comes in and picks up the phone
ill get it
on phone hello
yes this is mrs
george enters shot and stands listening to her
oh thank you mrs
im sure shell be all right
the doctor says that she ought to be out of bed in time to have her christmas dinner
is that zuzus teacher
hand over receiver yes
let me speak to her
he snatches the phone from mary
on phone hello
this is george bailey
im zuzus father
say what kind of a teacher are you anyway
what do you mean sending her home like that halfnaked
do you realize shell probably end up with pneumonia on account of you
she puts a restraining hand on his arm
he shakes it off
she cannot know that georges tirade against mrs
welch is really a tirade against the world against life itself against god
over the phone we hear mrs
welchs voice sputtering with protest
is this the sort of thing we pay taxes for to have teachers like you
silly stupid careless people who send our kids home without any clothes on
you know maybe my kids arent the best dressed kids maybe they dont have any decent clothes
mary succeeds in wresting the phone from georges hand
aw that stupid
mary speaks quickly in to the phone
i want to apologize
to george shes hung up
savagely ill hang her up
but the telephone is suddenly alive with a powerful male voice calling now who do you think you are
george hears this and grabs the receiver from mary
to mary wait a minute
on phone hello
who is this
okay thats fine mr
gives me a chance to tell you what i really think of your wife
mary once more tries to take the phone from him
raving at her will you get out and let me handle this
into phone shouting hello
oh you will huh
welch any time you think youre man enough
but before he can think of an insult to top welchs we hear a click on the phone
he hangs up the receiver and turns toward the living room
his face is flushed and wet
daddy how do you spell hallelujah
shouts how should i know
what do you think i am a dictionary
he yells at tommy noisily playing with his vacuum cleaner
tommy stop that
janie is still practicing at the piano monotonously
savagely janie havent you learned that silly tune yet
youve played it over and over again
now stop it
the room has suddenly become ominously quiet the only sound being georges labored breathing
george goes over to a corner of the room where his workshop is set up a drawing table several models of modern buildings bridges etc
savagely he kicks over the models picks up some books and hurls them into the corner
mary and the children watch horrified
george looks around and sees them staring at him as if he were some unknown wild animal
the three children are crying
gasping for breath im sorry mary janie
i didnt mean
you go on and practice
pete i owe you an apology too
what do you want to know
holding back his tears nothing daddy
mary and the children stare at him stunned by his furious outburst
there is silence in the room
whats the matter with everybody
janie go on
i told you to practice
shouts now go on play
janie breaks into sobs
in an outburst george why must you torture the children
why dont you
the sight of mary and the children suffering is too much for george
he looks around him then quickly goes out the front door of the house
mary goes to the phone picks it up
bedford two four seven please
is daddy in trouble
shall i pray for him
yes janie pray very hard
you too tommy
on phone hello uncle billy
potter is seated at his desk his goon beside him
he is signing some papers
george is seated in a chair before the desk without a hat or coat covered lightly with snow
im in trouble mr
i need help
through some sort of an accident my companys short in their accounts
the bank examiners up there today
ive got to raise eight thousand dollars immediately
casually oh so thats what the reporters wanted to talk to you about
incredulous the reporters
they called me up from your building and loan
oh theres a man over there from the d
s office too
hes looking for you
desperate please help me mr
help me wont you please
cant you see what it means to my family
ill pay you any sort of a bonus on the loan
if you still want the building and loan why i
interrupting george could it possibly be theres a slight discrepancy in the books
theres nothing wrong with the books
ive just misplaced eight thousand dollars
i cant find it anywhere
looking up you misplaced eight thousand dollars
have you notified the police
i didnt want the publicity
harrys homecoming tomorrow
snorts theyre going to believe that one
whatve you been doing george
playing the market with the companys money
what is it a woman then
you know its all over town that youve been giving money to violet bick
not that it makes any difference to me but why did you come to me
why dont you go to sam wainwright and ask him for the money
i cant get hold of him
hes in europe
well what about all your other friends
they dont have that kind of money mr
you know that
youre the only one in town that can help me
ive suddenly become quite important
what kind of security would i have george
have you got any stocks
shaking his head no sir
collateral of any kind
pulls out policy i have some life insurance a fifteen thousand dollar policy
how much is your equity in it
five hundred dollars
sarcastically look at you
you used to be so cocky
you were going to go out and conquer the world
you once called me a warped frustrated old man
what are you but a warped frustrated young man
a miserable little clerk crawling in here on your hands and knees and begging for help
no securities no stocks no bonds nothing but a miserable little five hundred dollar equity in a life insurance policy
youre worth more dead than alive
why dont you go to the riff raff you love so much and ask them to let you have eight thousand dollar
you know why
because theyd run you out of town on a rail
but ill tell you what im going to do for you george
since the state examiner is still here as a stockholder of the building and loan im going to swear out a warrant for your arrest
misappropriation of funds manipulation malfeasance
george turns and starts out of the office as potter picks up the phone and dials
all right george go ahead
you cant hide in a little town like this
george is out of the door by now
camera moves closer to potter
on phone bill
this is potter
george comes out of the bank into the falling snow
he crosses the street tugs at the door of his old car finally steps over the door and drives off
an attractive little roadside tavern with the name martinis in neon lights on the front wall
the place is an italian restaurant with bar
the bottles sparkle
there are christmas greens and holly decorating the place
it has a warm welcoming spirit like martini himself who is welcoming new arrivals
the booths and the checkered cloth covered tables are full
there is an air of festivity and friendliness and more like a party than a public drinking place
george is seated at the bar he has had a great deal to drink far more than hes accustomed to
greeting new customers merry christmas
glad you came
how about some of that good spaghetti
we got everything
during this camera moves closer to george
nick the bartender is watching him solicitously
seated on the other side of george is a burly individual drinking a glass of beer
george is mumbling god
dear father in heaven im not a praying man but if youre up there and you can hear me show me the way
im at the end of my rope
show me the way god
friendly are you all right george
want someone to take you home
george shakes his head
martini comes over to his side
worried why you drink so much my friend
please go home mr
this is christmas eve
the ugly man next to george who has been listening reacts sharply to the name bailey
this is mr
without any warning the burly man throws a vicious punch at george who goes down and out
martini nick and several others rush to pick him up
to george and the next time you talk to my wife like that youll get worse
she cried for an hour
it isnt enough she slaves teaching your stupid kids how to read and write and you have to bawl her out
furious you get out of here mr
welch reaches in his pocket for money
i want to pay for my drink
never mind the money
you get out of here quick
you hit my best friend
nick and martini shove welch out the door then run back to help george to his feet
georges mouth is cut and bleeding
you all right george
stunned who was that
his name is welch
he dont come in to my place no more
thats what i get for praying
the last time he come in here
you hear that nick
yes you bet
wheres my insurance policy
finds it in pocket oh here
he starts for the door
oh no please dont go out this way mr
im all right
nick and martini try to stop him but he shrugs them off
oh no you dont feel so good
im all right
please dont go away please
george opens the door and exits to the street
georges car comes along the empty street through the falling snow suddenly swerves and crashes into a tree near the sidewalk of a house
george gets out to look at the damage and savagely kicks at the open door of the car trying to shut it
the noise brings the owner of the house running out
what do you think youre doing
george stands unsteadily near the car shaken by the accident
the front lights are broken and the fender is ripped
george stands dully looking at the damage
the owner comes up looking at his tree
he leans over to examine the damages
with indignation now look what you did
my greatgrandfather planted this tree
george staggers off down the street paying no attention to the man
come back here you drunken fool
get this car out of here
george is crossing the approach to the bridge when a truck swings around the corner and nearly hits him
hey whats the matter with you
look where youre going
the truck turns onto the bridge and george takes a narrow catwalk at the railing
george has stopped by the railing at the center of the bridge
the snow is now falling hard
camera shooting down from georges angle to the water dotted with floating ice passing under the bridge
he stares down at the water desperate trying to make up his mind to act
he leans over looking at the water fascinated glances furtively around him hunches himself as though about to jump
from above george a body hurtles past and lands in the water with a loud splash
george looks down horrified
from river help
george quickly takes off his coat and dives over the railing into the water
george comes up sees the man flailing about in the water and camera pans with him as he swims toward the man
the toll house keeper hearing the cries for help comes running out on the bridge with a flashlight which he shines on the two figures struggling in the water below
the man in the water is clarence the angel whose voice we have heard speaking from heaven
george reaches him grabs hold of him and starts swimming for shore
george is seated before a wood burning stove before which his clothes are drying on a line
he is in his long winter underwear
he is sipping a mug of hot coffee staring at the stove cold gloomy and drunk ignoring clarence and the tollkeeper preoccupied by his near suicide and his unsolved problems
clarence is standing on the other side of the stove putting on his undershirt
this is a ludicrous seventeenth century garment which looks like a babys night shirt with embroidered cuffs and collar and gathered at the neck with a drawstring
it falls below his knees
the tollkeeper is seated against the wall eyeing them suspiciously
throughout the scene he attempts to spit but each time is stopped by some amazing thing clarence does or says
clarence becomes aware that his garment is amazing the tollkeeper
i didnt have time to get some stylish underwear
my wife gave me this on my last birthday
i passed away in it
the tollkeeper about to spit is stopped in the middle of it by this remark
clarence secretly trying to get georges attention now picks up a copy of tom sawyer which is hanging on the line drying
he shakes the book
oh tom sawyers drying out too
you should read the new book mark twains writing now
the tollkeeper stares at him incredulously
howd you happen to fall in
i didnt fall in
i jumped in to save george
george looks up surprised
to save me
well i did didnt i
you didnt go through with it did you
go through with what
george and the tollkeeper react to this
its against the law to commit suicide around here
yeah its against the law where i come from too
where do you come from
he leans forward to spit but is stopped by clarences next statement
to george i had to act quickly thats why i jumped in
i knew if i were drowning youd try to save me
and you see you did and thats how i saved you
the tollkeeper becomes increasingly nervous
george casually looks at the strange smiling little man a second time
offhand very funny
your lips bleeding george
georges hand goes to his mouth
yeah i got a bust in the jaw in answer to a prayer a little bit ago
comes around to george oh no no no
im the answer to your prayer
thats why i was sent down here
casually interested how do you know my name
oh i know all about you
ive watched you grow up from a little boy
what are you a mind reader or something
well who are you then
clarence odbody a s
whats that a s
angel second class
the tollkeepers chair slips out from under him with a crash
he has been leaning against the wall on it tipped back on two legs
tollkeeper rises and makes his way warily out the door
from his expression he looks like hell call the nearest cop
to tollkeeper cheerio my good man
george rubs his head with his hand to clear his mind
i wonder what martini put in those drinks
he looks up at clarence standing beside him
hey whats with you
what did you say just a minute ago
whyd you want to save me
thats what i was sent down for
im your guardian angel
i wouldnt be a bit surprised
ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money
eight thousand dollars
just things like that
now howd you know that
i told you im your guardian angel
i know everything about you
well you look about like the kind of an angel id get
sort of a fallen angel arent you
what happened to your wings
i havent won my wings yet
thats why im an angel second class
i dont know whether i like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings
oh ive got to earn them and youll help me wont you
humoring him sure sure
by letting me help you
only one way you can help me
you dont happen to have eight thousand bucks on you
oh no no
we dont use money in heaven
oh thats right i keep forgetting
comes in pretty handy down here bub
oh tut tut tut
i found it out a little late
im worth more dead than alive
now look you mustnt talk like that
i wont get my wings with that attitude
you just dont know all that youve done
if it hadnt been for you
interrupts yeah if it hadnt been for me everybodyd be a lot better off
my wife and my kids and my friends
annoyed with clarence look little fellow go off and haunt somebody else will you
no you dont understand
ive got my job
savagely aw shut up will you
clarence is not getting far with george
he glances up paces across the room thoughtfully
to himself hmmm this isnt going to be so easy
to george so you still think killing yourself would make everyone feel happier eh
dejectedly oh i dont know
i guess youre right
i suppose it would have been better if id never been born at all
whatd you say
i said i wish id never been born
oh you mustnt say things like that
gets an idea wait a minute
wait a minute
thats an idea
glances up toward heaven what do you think
yeah thatll do it
to george youve got your wish
youve never been born
as clarence speaks this line the snow stops falling outside the building a strong wind springs up which blows open the door to the shack
clarence runs to close the door
looking upward you dont have to make all that fuss about it
as clarence speaks george cocks his head curiously favoring his deaf ear more interested in his hearing than in what clarence has said
what did you say
youve never been born
you dont exist
you havent a care in the world
george feels his ear as clarence talks
no worries no obligations no eight thousand dollars to get no potter looking for you with the sheriff
george indicates his bad ear
say something else in that ear
bending down sure
you can hear out of it
well thats the doggonedest thing
i havent heard anything out of that ear since i was a kid
must have been that jump in the cold water
your lips stopped bleeding too george
george feels his lip which shows no sign of the recent cut he received from welch
he is now thoroughly confused
what do you know about that
george looks around as though to get his bearings
its stopped snowing out hasnt it
whats happened here
standing up come on soon as these clothes of ours are dry
our clothes are dry
george feels the clothes on the line
what do you know about that
stoves hotter than i thought
now come on get your clothes on and well stroll up to my car and get
they start dressing
george interrupts himself
oh im sorry
i cant fly
i havent got any wings
you havent got your wings
yeah thats right
this is the same empty street where georges car swerved into the tree near the sidewalk
george and clarence come into shot and up to the spot where george had left his car smashed against the tree
george looks around but his car is nowhere to be seen and the tree is undamaged
whats the matter
puzzled well this is where i left my car and it isnt here
you have no car
well i had a car and it was right here
i guess somebody moved it
the owner of the house passes with some christmas packages under his arm
politely good evening
wheres my car
i beg your pardon
my car my car
im the fellow that owns the car that ran into your tree
what do you mean what tree
here i ran into it
cut a big gash in the side of it here
the owner bends down to examine the trunk of the tree then straightens up and smells georges breath
he backs away
you must mean two other trees
you had me worried
one of the oldest trees in pottersville
why you mean bedford falls
i mean pottersville
sharply dont you think i know where i live
whats the matter with you
the owner proceeds toward his house
george is completely bewildered
oh i dont know
either im off my nut or he is
to clarence or you are
it isnt me
well maybe i left the car up at martinis
well come on gabriel
he puts his arm around clarence and they start off up the road
as they go clarence
it is martinis place but almost unrecognizable
the cheerful italian feeling is gone
it is now more of a hard drinking joint a honky tonk
same bar tables have no covers
people are lower down and tougher
nick the bartender is behind the bar
george and clarence come in
george does not notice the difference but clarence is all eyes and beaming
they go up to the bar
as they come in thats all right
go on in
martinis a good friend of mine
two people leave the bar as they approach
theres a place to sit down
nick is wiping off the bar as they sit down
oh hello nick
hey wheres martini
you want a martini
no no martini
where is he
impatient look im the boss
you want a drink or dont you
okay all right
double bourbon quick huh
to clarence whats yours
i was just thinking
face puckers up with delicious anticipation its been so long since i
impatient look mister im standing here waiting for you to make up your mind
appreciatively thats a good man
i was just thinking of a flaming rum punch
no its not cold enough for that
not nearly cold enough
wait a minute
wait a minute
i got it
mulled wine heavy on the cinnamon and light on the cloves
off with you me lad and be lively
hey look mister we serve hard drinks in here for men who want to get drunk fast
and we dont need any characters around to give the joint atmosphere
is that clear
or do i have to slip you my left for a convincer
as he says this nick leans over the counter and puts his left fist nearly in clarences eye
clarence is puzzled by this conduct
to george whats he talking about
soothingly nick nick just give him the same as mine
nick turns away to get the drinks
whats the matter with him
i never saw nick act like that before
youll see a lot of strange things from now on
hey little fellow you worry me
you got someplace to sleep
you dont huh
well you got any money
nick is listening suspiciously to this conversation
no wonder you jumped in the river
i jumped in the river to save you so i could get my wings
nick stops pouring the drinks bottle poised in his hand
oh thats right
a cash register bell rings off stage
clarence reacts to the sound of the bell
somebodys just made it
every time you hear a bell ring it means that some angels just got his wings
george glances up at nick
look i think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here
dont they believe in angels
looking at nick a
then why should they be surprised when they see one
to nick he never grew up
to clarence how old are you anyway clarence
two hundred and ninety three
thinks next may
nick slams the bottle down on the counter
that does it
out you two pixies go through the door or out the window
angrily and thats another thing
where do you come off calling me nick
well nick thats your name isnt it
whats that got to do with it
i dont know you from adams off ox
sees someone come in hey you
a small wreck of a man with weak watery eyes
obviously a broken down panhandler his hat in his hand
he can hardly believe his eyes
it is gower the druggist
to gower didnt i tell you never to come panhandling around here
nick picks up a seltzer bottle and squirts gower in the face with it
the crowd laugh brutally
gower smiles weakly as the soda runs off his face
george horrified leaps up and goes over to gower
this is george bailey
dont you know me
to his bouncers throw him out
throw him out
the bouncers throw gower out the front door
george rushes back to the bar
bewildered hey what is
hey nick nick
isnt that mr
gower the druggist
you know thats another reason for me not to like you
that rumhead spent twenty years in jail for poisoning a kid
if you know him you must be a jailbird yourself
to his bouncers would you show these gentlemen to the door
this way gentlemen
george and clarence come flying through the door and land in the snow
nick at the cash register busily ringing the bell
im giving out wings
george and clarence lying in the snow
george has a strange puzzled look on his face
they remain for a moment as they landed looking at each other
you see george you were not there to stop gower from putting that poison into the
what do you mean i wasnt there
i remember distinctly
george catches a glimpse of the front of the building with the neon sign over the door
it now reads nicks place instead of martinis
george and clarence get to their feet
exasperated what the
hey whats going on around here
why this ought to be martinis place
he points to the sign and looks at clarence
clarence sort of hangs his head
george fixes him with a very interested look
look who are you
patiently i told you george
im your guardian angel
george still looking at him goes up to him and pokes his arm
yeah yeah i know
you told me that
what else are you
are you a hypnotist
no of course not
well then why am i seeing all these strange things
dont you understand george
its because you were not born
then if i wasnt born who am i
you have no identity
george rapidly searches his pockets for identification but without success
what do you mean no identity
my names george bailey
there is no george bailey
you have no papers no cards no drivers license no f card no insurance policy
he says these things as george searches for them george looks in his watch pocket
theyre not there either
george feverishly continues to turn his pockets inside out
youve been given a great gift george
a chance to see what the world would be like without you
george is completely befuddled
shaking his head now wait a minute here
wait a minute here
as this is some sort of a funny dream im having here
so long mister im going home
he starts off
furious now shut up
cut it out
thats what i think
youre screwy and youre driving me crazy too
im seeing things
im going home and see my wife and family
do you understand that
and im going home alone
george strides off hurriedly
clarence slowly follows him glancing up toward heaven as he goes
howm i doing joseph
pause no i didnt have a drink
the sign bearing the name of the town reads pottersville
george looks at it in surprise then starts up the street toward the main part of town
as he goes camera moves with him
the character of the place has completely changed
where before it was a quiet orderly small town it has now become in nature like a frontier village
we see a series of shots of night clubs cafes bars liquor stores pool halls and the like with blaring jazz music issuing from the majority of them
the motion picture theatre has become a burlesque house
gowers drugstore is now a pawnbrokers establishment and so on
george stops before what used to be the offices of the building and loan
there is a garish electric sign over the entrance reading welcome jitterbugs
a crowd of people are watching the police who are raiding the place and dragging out a number of screaming women whom they throw into a patrol wagon
george talks to one of the cops hey
where did the building and loan move to
the building and what
the bailey building and loan
it was up there
they went out of business years ago
george sees the struggling figure of violet bick arrayed as a tart being dragged into the patrol wagon
to the cop hey listen thats violet bick
i know that girl
the cop shoves george to one side
he looks around and sees ernies taxi cruising slowly by
hey ernie ernie
ernie stops the cab and george enters it
ernie take me home
im off my nut
a much harder ernie where do you live
aw now doggone it ernie dont you start pulling that stuff
you know where i live
three twenty sycamore
now hurry up
three twenty sycamore
yeah yeah hurry up
he pulls down the flag on the meter and starts the cab
ernie is puzzled by the stranger
look here ernie straighten me out here
ive got some bad liquor or something
listen to me now
now you are ernie bishop and you live in bailey park with your wife and kid
thats right isnt it
suspiciously you seen my wife
exasperated seen your wife
ive been to your house a hundred times
look bud whats the idea
i live in a shack in potters field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid
and i aint never seen you before in my life
just step on it
just get me home
ernie turns to driving but hes worried about his passenger
as he passes the burlesque house he sees bert the cop standing beside his police car
attracting his attention he motions to bert to follow him indicating he has a nut in the back
bert gets into his car and follows
the taxi pulls up to the curb and stops
the cab is parked
george gets out and looks at the house
is this the place
of course its the place
well this house aint been lived in for twenty years
george is stopped momentarily by the appearance of the house
windows are broken the porch sags one section of the roof has fallen doors and shutters hang askew on their hinges
like a doomed man george approaches the house
the police car has pulled up beside the cab and bert and ernie stand watching georges actions
whats up ernie
i dont know but we better keep an eye on this guy
ernie switches on the spotlight on his cab and turns the beam toward the old house
the interior of the house is lit up here and there ghostlike by ernies spotlight
no furniture cobwebs wallpaper hanging and swinging stairs are broken and collapsed
in a voice that sounds like a cry for help george yells out mary
where are you
clarence suddenly appears leaning against a wall
theyre not here george
you have no children
ignoring him where are you
then to clarence what have you done with them
bert is standing in the entrance with his gun in his hand
ernie is a few feet behind him ready to run
all right put up your hands
no fast moves
come on out here both of you
thank heaven youre here
he rushes toward bert
bert whats happened to this house
wheres my kids
warningly watch him bert
come on come on
bewildered bert ernie
whats the matter with you two guys
you were here on my wedding night
you both of you stood out here on the porch and sung to us dont you remember
nervously think id better be going
look now why dont you be a good kid and well take you in to a doctor
everythings going to be all right
bert tries to lead george away by the arm but george struggles with him trying to explain
bert now listen to me
ernie will you take me over to my mothers house
gesturing to clarence its that fellow there he says hes an angel hes tried to hypnotize me
i hate to do this fella
bert raises his gun to hit george on the head
as he does so clarence darts in and fixes his teeth in berts wrist forcing him to let george go
george dashes out of the house and down the street as bert grapples with clarence and they fall to the ground wrestling
we see bert kneeling trying to put handcuffs on clarence
oh shut up
help oh joseph help
suddenly clarence disappears from under berts hands
bert gets up amazed by his vanishing
whered he go
whered he go
i had him right here
ernies hair is now standing on end with fright
stammering i need a drink
he runs out of the scene
well which wayd they go
help me find em
george runs up the path to the front door of the house and raps on the door
he rings the bell and taps on the glass when his attention is caught by a sign on the wall reading ma baileys boarding house
the door opens and a woman appears
it is mrs
bailey but she has changed amazingly
her face is harsh and tired
in her eyes once kindly and understanding there is now cold suspicion
she gives no sign that she knows him
what do you want
it is a cruel blow to george
mother this is george
i thought sure youd remember me
coldly george who
if youre looking for a room theres no vacancy
she starts to close the door but george stops her
oh mother mother please help me
something terribles happened to me
i dont know what it is
somethings happened to everybody
please let me come in
keep me here until i get over it
get over what
i dont take in strangers unless theyre sent here by somebody i know
desperate well i know everybody you know
your brother in law uncle billy
suspiciously you know him
well sure i do
whend you see him last
today over at the house
thats a lie
hes been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business
and if you ask me thats where you belong
she slams the door shut in georges face
george stands a moment stunned
then he turns and runs out to the sidewalk until his face fills the screen
his features are distorted by the emotional chaos within him
we see clarence leaning on the mail box at the curb holding his volume of tom sawyer in his hand
strange isnt it
each mans life touches so many other lives and when he isnt around he leaves an awful hole doesnt he
quietly trying to use logic ive heard of things like this
youve got me in some kind of a spell or something
well im going to get out of it
ill get out of it
i know how too
the last man i talked to before all this stuff started happening to me was martini
you know where he lives
sure i know where he lives
he lives in bailey park
they walk out of scene
george and clarence approach the tree from which the bailey park sign once hung
now it is just outside a cemetery with graves where the houses used to be
are you sure this is bailey park
oh im not sure of anything anymore
all i know is this should be bailey park
but where are the houses
the two walk into the cemetery
as they go you werent here to build them
george wandering like a lost soul among the tombstones clarence trotting at his heels
again george stops to stare with frightened eyes at upon it is engraved a name harry bailey
feverishly george scrapes away the snow covering the rest of the inscription and we read in memory of our beloved son harry bailey your brother harry bailey broke through the
ice and was drowned at the age of nine
george jumps up
thats a lie
harry bailey went to war
he got the congressional medal of honor
he saved the lives of every man on that transport
sadly every man on that transport died
harry wasnt there to save them because you werent there to save harry
you see george you really had a wonderful life
dont you see what a mistake it would be to throw it away
oh well i cant
i dont know how you know these things but tell me where is she
george grabs clarence by the coat collar and shakes him
if you know where she is tell me where my wife is
im not supposed to tell
becoming violent please clarence tell me where she is
youre not going to like it george
shouting where is she
shes an old maid
she never married
choking him wheres mary
where is she
where is she
in self defense shes just about to close up the library
george lets clarence go and runs off
clarence falls to the ground where he rubs his neck
to himself there must be some easier way for me to get my wings
mary comes out the door then turns and locks it
we see george watching her from the sidewalk
mary is very different no buoyancy in her walk none of marys abandon and love of life
glasses no make up lips compressed elbows close to body
she looks flat and dried up and extremely self satisfied and efficient
george as he watches her
george and mary on the sidewalk
she looks up surprised but not recognizing him continues on
mary starts to run away from him and he follows desperately
he catches up to her grabs her by the arms and keeps a tight grip on her
she struggles to free herself
mary its george
dont you know me
whats happened to us
struggling i dont know you
let me go
oh dont do this to me
please mary help me
wheres our kids
i need you mary
help me mary
mary breaks away from him and dashes into the first door she comes to the blue moon bar
small tables booths perhaps a counter
it is crowded
many of the people are the same who were present during the run on the building and loan
mary comes running in screaming
the place goes into an uproar
george comes in practically insane
some of the men grab and hold on to him
to men holding him let me go
mary dont run away
somebody call the police
hit him with a bottle
he needs a strait jacket
from back of room that man stop him
recognizing some of them tom
thats my wife
mary lets out a final scream then faints into the arms of a couple of women at the bar
oh no you dont
george cant fight through the men holding him
desperately he thinks of clarence and heads for the door
where are you
just as george breaks through the door bert arrives in his police car
he gets out and heads for the door to run into george as he comes out
oh its you
he grabs for george who lets him have one square on the button knocking him down then continues running down the street yelling for clarence
bert gets up takes out his gun and fires several shots after the fleeing figure
to crowd stand back
bert gets into the police car and siren screaming sets off in pursuit of george
the same part of the bridge where george was standing before clarence jumped in
the wind is blowing as it has all through this sequence
george comes running into shot
he is frantically looking for clarence
help me clarence
get me back
get me back
i dont care what happens to me
only get me back to my wife and kids
help me clarence please
i want to live again
george leaning on the bridge railing praying
i want to live again
i want to live again
please god let me live again
suddenly toward the end of the above the wind dies down
a soft gentle snow begins to fall
the police car pulls up on the roadway behind him and bert comes into scene
you all right
george backs away and gets set to hit bert again
hey whats the matter
warningly now get out of here bert or ill hit you again
what the sam hill you yelling for george
george talks hopefully george touches bert unbelievingly georges mouth is bleeding again
bert do you know me
are you kiddin
ive been looking all over town trying to find you
i saw your car piled into that tree down there and i thought maybe
hey your mouths bleeding are you sure youre all right
george touches his lips with his tongue wipes his mouth with his hand laughs happily
his rapture knows no bounds
joyously my mouths bleeding bert
my mouths bleed
feeling in watch pocket zuzus petals
theyre here bert
what do you know about that
he practically embraces the astonished bert then runs at top speed toward town
george runs away from camera yelling mary
georges wrecked car is smashed against the tree
he comes running into shot sees the car lets out a triumphant yell pats the car and dashes on
george sees that the pottersville sign is now replaced by the original you are now in bedford falls sign
hello bedford falls
he turns and runs through the falling snow up the main street of the town
as he runs he notices that the town is back in its original appearance
he passes some late shoppers on the street merry christmas
ad lib merry christmas
merry christmas george
merry christmas movie house
merry christmas emporium
merry christmas you wonderful old building and loan
george notices a light in potters office window and races across the street
potter is seated working at his desk his goon by his side
george pounds on the window
from outside merry christmas mr
george runs off as potter looks up from his work
happy new year to you in jail
go on home theyre waiting for you
the lights are on
there is a fire in the fireplace
the christmas tree is fully decorated with presents stacked around
carter the bank examiner a newspaper reporter and photographer and a sheriff are waiting in the hall for george
george comes dashing in the front door
sees the men well hello mr
he grabs his hand and shakes it
bailey theres a deficit
eight thousand dollars
reaching into pocket george ive got a little paper here
happily ill bet its a warrant for my arrest
isnt it wonderful
the photographer sets off a flash bulb
george runs to the kitchen
he gets no answer
as he goes oh look at this wonderful old drafty house
he comes running back to the hall
have you seen my wife
merry christmas daddy
merry christmas daddy
the three children are at the top of the stairs
they are in their pajamas
george starts to run up the stairs and the old familiar knob on the banister comes off in his hand
he kisses it lovingly and puts it back then continues up the stairs
pete kids janie tommy
takes them in his arms i could eat you up
george and the kids
he is hugging them
wheres your mother
she went looking for you with uncle billy
zuzu comes running out of her bedroom
george crushes her to him
my little gingersnap
how do you feel
and not a smitch of temperature
laughing not a smitch of temp
as mary comes through the door breathless and excited
the four men are watching with open mouths
to the men hello
sees george george
mary races up the stairs where george meets her in a fierce embrace
where have you been
george and mary embrace tearfully
oh george george george
let me touch you
oh youre real
oh george george
you have no idea whats happened to me
you have no idea what happened
he stops her with a kiss
she leads him excitedly down the stairs
well come on george come on downstairs quick
theyre on their way
mary leads george who is carrying a couple of the kids on his back to a position in front of the christmas tree
come on in here now
now you stand right over here by the tree
right there and dont move dont move
i hear em now george its a miracle
its a miracle
she runs toward front door and flings it open
ad lib sounds of an excited crowd can be heard
uncle billy face flushed covered with snow and carrying a clothes basket filled with money bursts in
he is followed by ernie and about twenty more townspeople
come in uncle billy
uncle billy mary and the crowd come into the living room
a table stands in front of george
george picks up zuzu to protect her from the mob
uncle billy dumps the basketful of money out onto the table the money overflows and falls all over
isnt it wonderful
the rest of the crowd all greet george with greetings and smiles
each one comes forward with money
in their pockets in shoe boxes in coffee pots
money pours onto the table pennies dimes quarters dollar bills small money but lots of it
bailey and mrs
hatch push toward george
more people come in
the place becomes a bedlam
shouts of gangway gangway as a new bunch comes in and pours out its money
mary stands next to george watching him
george stands there overcome and speechless as he holds zuzu
as he sees the familiar faces he gives them sick grins
tears course down his face
his lips frame their names as he greets them
emotionally at the breaking point mary did it george
mary did it
she told a few people you were in trouble and they scattered all over town collecting money
they didnt ask any questions just said if george is in trouble count on me
you never saw anything like it
tom comes in digging in his purse as he comes
what is this george
another run on the bank
charlie adds his money to the pile
here you are george
ernie is trying to get some system into the chaos
the line forms on the right
martini comes in bearing a mixing bowl overflowing with cash
step right up here
martini dumps his money on the table
i busted the juke box too
gower enters with a large glass jar jammed full of notes
to george i made the rounds of my charge accounts
violet bick arrives and takes out the money george had given her for her trip to new york
im not going to go george
i changed my mind
annie the colored maid enters digging money out of a long black stocking
ive been saving this money for a divorce if ever i get a husband
partridge the high school principal is the next donor
there you are george
i got the faculty all up out of bed
hands his watch to zuzu and heres something for you to play with
giving money i wouldnt have a roof over my head if it wasnt for you george
ernie is reading a telegram he has just received
just a minute
now this is from london
gower cables you need cash
my office instructed to advance you up to twenty five thousand dollars
heehaw and merry christmas
the crowd breaks into a cheer as ernie drops the telegram on top of the pile of money on the table
calling out mr
how about some wine
as various members of the family bring out a punch bowl and glasses janie sits down at the piano and strikes a chord
she starts playing hark
the herald angels sing and the entire crowd joins in the singing
we see a series of shots of the various groups singing the hymn and some people are still coming in and dropping their money on the table
carter the bank examiner makes a donation the sheriff sheepishly looks at george and tears his warrant in small pieces
in the midst of this scene harry in naval uniform enters accompanied by bert the cop
hello george how are you
as he sees the money mary looks like i got here too late
mary i got him here from the airport as quickly as i could
the fool flew all the way up here in a blizzard
bailey enters scene
harry how about your banquet in new york
oh i left right in the middle of it as soon as i got marys telegram
ernie hands harry a glass of wine
good idea ernie
to my big brother george
the richest man in town
once more the crowd breaks into cheering and applause
janie at the piano and bert on his accordion start playing auld lang syne and everyone joins in
george still holding zuzu in his arms glances down at the pile of money on the table
his eye catches something on top of the pile and he reaches down for it
it is clarences copy of tom sawyer
george opens it and finds an inscription written in it dear george remember no man is a failure who has friends
thanks for the wings love clarence
looking at book whats that
thats a christmas present from a very dear friend of mine
at this moment perhaps because of the jostling of some of the people on the other side of the tree a little silver bell on the christmas tree swings to
and fro with a silvery tinkle
zuzu closes the cover of the book and points to the bell
teacher says every time a bell rings an angel gets his wings
smiling thats right thats right
he looks up toward the ceiling and winks
