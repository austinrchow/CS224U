written by tom hanks from a story by tom hanks nia vardalos nov
big and orange and full of hope as sure as fate
a dawn as promising as well this new day
sun is rising over
a flat roof that stretches to the horizon
a vast expanse
a plain of gravel embedded tar studded with
hvac units and power lines the kind that service a huge commercial building
in fact this kind of building
a unimart store
a flagship of savings a mother lode of low low prices
and then some square feet of the consumer economy
empty thus far
a few employee autos arriving in their assigned slots far from the entrance
one of those cars is a old not so vintage nor classic convertible
karmann ghia belonging to
larry crowne a man as reliable and predictable as that rising sun
actually hes a team leader of this unimart dressed in his un sexy un fashionable un flattering khaki pants and company polo
larry has had the ragtop down
he wrestles it up locks the cover into place
he doesnt just walk to work but s t r i d e s across the asphalt field like a sultan of sales a viscount of discount
he cheers co workers at the start of the day shouting encouragement flashing thumbs up knocking on car doors and squeezing shoulders
a seven speed mix o meter food processor
the morning circle of sales
employees and their wares
larry stands yet to speak ready for his moment of pronounced enthusiasm
fifteen foot jumper cables cents a foot
cents a pound bag
wave that merchandise
three pack of mens elastic waist mid thigh boxer shorts
words fill the screen
four toby jug beer steins
mp player the size of a bottle cap
something and cents
duck blind print sheets for a queen size bed
where united you save
larry crowne leads the high fives
larry controlling the aisles like an admiral at a battle map
stacking a mountain of tube socks
stocking those briefs
hanging metallica speedos on little hangers
helping cubby a very skinny and disinterested janitor clean up some baby up chuck as the baby up chucks again
too much mac cheese for this little pickle bug
they do love the comfort food
dont you lil pickle bug
imagine any duty and see how larry gets it done
larry is collecting loose shopping carts steering them into pairs triplets sextuplets then riding them into the cart pen like a trail boss
that same up chucking baby was riding on the coin pony and up chucked again
larry is cleaning it all up
a beat up car with a big stork pizza sign stuck on its roof pulls right up to the front of the store parking in the handicapped space
park there and youll get a ticket
call a cop doof
im gone in sixty seconds
a dozen pizza boxes you guys having a party
the big stork pizza boxes have been raided for slices
a retirement party is going on
a sign reads good luck dorothy genkos
the name has been printed over the last person to retire
people are cutting loose as best they can at a no alcohol corporate fete
none more than larry
who is organizing a mosh pit for dorothy genkos an old lady
this is a fun group
over in the corner though is the front office staff cox strang andrews and hurley female
and her forty two k a year are history
who else would do us that favor
wish theyd all sail off like her
save us some grief
the r bomb is going to do some collateral damage to this place
hurley is shocked
oh my god
separating the chaff from the wheat
chaff is the bad stuff right
chaff is the waste matter correct
when are we restructuring
thems our orders
hurley looks sick
she hates this
what say we drop a brick in the pond to warn the herd
someone theyd never expect to be let go
to look fair
i like it
like a team leader
suggestions on who it should be
i say crowne
strang rolls his eyes
avery wont retire
we fire him its a law suit
alvarez is about to drop a kid
shell go part time in a week
alvarez heavy with child
crownes pink slip will save da u big green backwash
what salary tier is crowne at
top of the pyramid with a c
bump at the first of the year
well need actionable cause of course
they all agree yeah
hows his review record
hes a candidate for employee of the month
his nd time
sluggers gimme a reason
larry has organized a limbo contest
we could use the limited horizons strategy
larry will always be passed over for management
he never went to college
youre that familiar with his record
she was his squeeze for a few weeks werent you vick
that was before the new employee covenants
that you even remember
the memory haunts me
hell sock us for severance
big brick in the pond though
lets call it
today end of shift unimart bids crowne adieu
larry is dancing up a storm
heading into the night shift
larry is the only team leader still on duty and sober
he is fastidious in his work
he pays no attention
vasquez a huge security guard comes by
lc why still here
team leaders zone departments before punching out
i mean here here
you just got paged to meeting room
now they can hear it sort of
probably to clean up after the party
isnt it employee of the month day
that is what it must be
speck tack alar
flushed at the prospect larry gives terrorist fist bumps
youre the only one around here who deserves it
how many will this be
ah whos counting
he flashes his fingers twenty two
larry cr wne soars into the room
cubby is cleaning up the substantial mess
the front office team has taken seats
remember how we saw the unimart way video vick
you and me alone in this room and look at us now
hurley has a frozen face
larry looks at andrews smile
the janitor literally drops everything and leaves
i think i know what this is about
i dont think you do
at unimart we care
so we take care
which makes moments like these tough for all of us
sounds like youre firing me
larry is joking
i take it back
corporate has mandated a restructuring in all unimart stores
thats the word they use
i call it a pain in the touchas
it is touchas right
where you get kicked
a yiddish word
like the buttocks
touchas and buttocks
hurts to get kicked back there no matter what language you speak
larry now gets it
unimart is firing me
crowne ie you did a heck of a job
who do you suggest
i dont think so
why not strang
ive been here longer than you jack
i started years ago as an inventory associate at the store on euclid
hurley takes over as blank as a tax form
seniority would preclude this reality larry but unimarts policy is to never limit your horizons
larry crowne has no idea what that means
heres the prob your lack of a graduate degree will forever retard any move up the management ladder
becasue you never went to college youre forever retarded
i wont make the front office
shows his college ring s
i went in the navy
right outta high school
five years and by then
thank you for your service to our country larry
and in total seriousness to unimart too
i thought i was employee of the month
in a way you are
larry cant believe this
nor can he move
im going to lose my house
the timing on this is always a bitch
we can fix this
cant we fix this
really wish we could
the generous severance package
she has a folder with posted sign heres
strang finds one last piece of party pizza
vasquez helps larry put down the ragged top of his car
jerks id fire before you
may walk away from unimart myself
stick it out
you go to college
then i blew out my
thanks for seeing me off
i need your apron man
says unimart on it so it aint yours
larry unharnesses himself from that which is not his
hands it over
scorned as the one let go
goofy car man
larry pulls up at a red light
from his hands free speaker jerry rigged on his dash we hear on hold music
then we hear the engines of scooters at least a dozen of them
they surround his car both lanes and the chatter of the riders as they scream over their engines as they ad remember you always have a friend at riverbank
lib where they are going next
laurie gammelgaard thank you for holding how may i help you
larry has to shout over the scooter squad ruckus
i was holding for barry raphael in home and real estate
raphael is no longer with the bank
how can i help you
barry is gone
i need to talk to someone in home and real estate
the scooter squad has made their decision and peel out reading his atm card i wish
im customer number and i can be there in three minutes
as long as you are here before six okey dokey
the scooters are gone but larry is still yelling
larry sits at gammelgaards desk looking at his own records sipping complimentary coffee that is ghastly
what happened to barry raphael
barry raphael was harassing the younger tellers but we are not supposed to admit that
this is some kick in the head
not sure what to tell you mr
i m hoping not to lose my house
youre carrying what on the house
two ninety two k
three years ago id have loaned you but i think you read the papers
laurie gammelgaard no
she gets a brochure the riverbank survival plan
but riverbank does have a plan for you
in a few weeks your financial base will tell us what we can do
find new employment
liquidate everything low on the value index
stick to a budget
clip coupons buy in bulk you know the drill
then come back and well work with you
thats riverbanks plan for me
it is friday mr
this is larry crownes street
this is larry crownes house
his car parks in the driveway and he steps out taking a minute to survey what he may lose
kids play down the street under a streetlight
an elderly neighbor is watering his lawn with a hose
a guy is playing with his dog
one house always has christmas lights
another has a handicapped ramp up to the front door
lamarr lives across the street from larry and is looking out the window as he prepares to light a scholarly looking pipe larrys home a little late tonight
his wife patience is sitting at the table pouring over catalogs
maybe he was out on a date
wed see that on the news
he is about to light up with a match
dont even think about lighting that up in my house
he is holding it in his hands
larry is about to throw the thing away but then puts it and some fabric softener in his washer
mood music plays from the crowne vinyl library a complete wall of lps
we can see into the
larry sits in his breakfast nook with an old laptop computer and a pot of coffee
an on line job application
larry is entering his data
he comes across that part of any application that will forever be daunting to him
what can he do but enter the truth
more on line applications flash by
plug it in center
education college didnt go white front house and home
education college high school
education college is it necessary
education college masters degree school of hard knocks
this may be futile
he looks about to give up
but then he thinks
thinks some more
unfolds like a piece of high tech assault equipment
the iron breathes hot fumes
spray starch plumes like jet exhaust
larry crowne is ironing his nicest shirt and his best khakis to perfection
he is focused
and good at ironing
larry is with the first customers of the day dressed to impress in those well ironed clothes
he strides right in to the giant store
he strides right out
larry is getting out of his car putting on a good face and heading inside
he gets right back into his car
larry is driving past the front windows of the store
resurrection letters scream lost our lease
everything must way back in the rear of the store behind a false panelling a furniture store should be ashamed of larry has filled out another application and is waiting
for someone to give it to
a planet staffer finally shows her head
how do i offer this up to personnel
there should be a box to put it in
larry finds a box
there should be another box
thats the one then
larry is alone again ignored as he applies for this job
patterson is a busy man while talking with larry
if you emailed an application weve got it and well keep you in mind
just following up with an in person visit
you have a great location here
not with unimart half a mile away
i used to work for unimart
i could spill you some
whats that mean
i know their trade secrets
traffic boosters loss leaders and bait and switch
and im ready to learn new strategies
ill stop by again so you can keep me in mind
if you wont work sundays dont bother
ill work every day
thats what i already do
patterson goes back to work as larry slinks away
establish that this is where many restaurants are located
larry sits in his car
the last thing he wants to do is work in a restaurant well find out why later on
but times are tough no
out he climbs resigned to fate
by the dumpster larry is asking a chef on his smoke break if they hav op nings
now hes asking some head cook pulling cutlets
larry is talking to chef amos who runs the place
oh i remember you
i never forget anyone who quits on me
as i recall i gave my notice and worked all my shifts and that was years ago
as i recall i had to hire and train a line cook to take your place
walking out doesnt happen in a vacuum you know
doesnt mean i wouldnt give you a job again
but youve been out of the business a long time and look around
i dont need you
the place is fully staffed and rocking
larry will not be working here
larrys scooter is parked near the entrance
larry is seated at the counter
perry pours him coffee as raul the head cook is talking from the service window
carlos and nick are in the back
you come in two weeks ago i would have kissed you on the mouth but carlos and nick they walked in
best i can do
put you at the top of the list
raul goes back to work
dang the timing kimosabe
wish i could help you but raul runs the back
not sure i could work here anyway
the atmosphere is too pleasant and the clientele too a number
breakfast on the house
chorizo scramble right
no charity today
i got things to do
i was just saying that
the door open the garage very tidy as larry moves old items out to the lawn
some things are already set up from the living room
is raising money with a yard sale
lamarr is about to pour himself some coffee when he sees a disaster looming across the street
hes out like a shot
lamarr comes charging out the rising door and across the street
theres been a yard sale at derby court since monica lewinsky
that gives me a monopoly on the location
you go yard on me larry crowne and i will destroy you
he is now standing on larrys lawn
larry looks at him
got fired yesterday
lamarr sits on a for sale chair
security sees you off by the time monday comes around the fired man is the forgotten man
they said its because i didnt go to college
the man just wanted you gone
his yard sale you liquidating assets to raise cash
buying out denises half of the house was the worst advice ever
i told you to avoid divorce lawyers
come with me
they cross the street to lamarrs house yard sale
ill tell you straight up im not lending you money
this is a semi professional operation
boats lamps tools chairs computers some of it almost junk is for barter or sale
inside his garage
clothes and books racks and shelves
patience is organizing boxes of vinyl lps
whole box of cha cha records from the fifties
you dont have any of these i promise
he cant afford em lost his job
unimart just lost my business forever
i love you too
sorry lie bare eye bee
get a better job somewhere so you can crush them
hard to do
hes going to get something better than a job
he finds a east city community college catalog
tosses it to larry
get some knowledge and youll be fire proof
arent there unemployed engineers and geophysicists
listen to my husband
hasnt called a man boss in years
paid off the house
you won the lottery
picked little numbers when i kept saying he was a fool
a quarter million dollars later ive shut up
lost half to taxes
ill see if theres a class in here for powerball
thats half a buck for the book
they give these away free
he is alone
he is going to lose his house
he has nothing to do
he has no future
he sits on the couch
espns sportscenter is showing highlights
hes asleep on the couch
he awakens to the very same edition of espns sportscenter showing the very same highlights
larry wants to shoot himself in the head
instead he picks up the catalog of east city college
the sign reads enroll now
larry parks in one of the hundreds of empty spaces
larry is trying to make sense out of the application
an enrollment counsellor dave busik sidles up to him
back to college huh
i was in the navy
adventure of a lifetime
we teach a whole track in hotel and restaurant food preparation
i need an all new career and a place to go everyday
those two things are my specialty
hallway walking towards busiks cubicle
bravo for choosing east city college
never too late for an education
second you need a jolt to the confidence machinery
he grabs a folder
i am going to change your life
a page in the catalog speech the art of informal remarks cause its not enough to just be smart anymore you have to project ease even when it aint easy
is this public speaking
job interviews will be a breeze with the confidence youll get from speech two one seven
and youll spend three hours a week with the most attractive package in all of academia
the golden girl of east city
mercedes tainot is a fierce defender of literacy and intelligence and definitely one attractive package
headache grogginess combo of biblical proportions
please enter your destination
stepping from her sub compact she struggles into a pair of heels as in this state she drives barefoot
if only her huge thermo cup held a hair of the dog she might not walk such a crooked mile from the parking lot to the campus
larry in his car screeches around a corner
he is frantically looking for a place to park but as this is the first day of term the lot is jammed
he nearly hits mercedes tainot
parkings impossible today
are you new to the faculty
new to the student body
this is the faculty lot
weve earned degrees for these spaces
students park on mars
im going to be late for my first day of school
i bet it wont be the first time
students search for their new classrooms
mercedes does too among these portable classrooms that have not moved in years
mercedes stops at the doorway
this is it
nine students sit self consciously including pinedo dibiasi mack and calimeris mercedes quickly does a head count
my day has just been made and its only in the morning
the city charter requires a minimum of ten students per class otherwise it costs more to have us here than not
did you really want a class at am
throw out those alarm clocks
larry crowne bursts through the door panting for breath
please tell me this is speech
mercedes drops her bag on her desk
she is crushed and hates larry crowne
she takes up some chalk turns to the board then writes in large shaky yet feminine script she underlines it four times
while earning a masters in shakespearean political discourse from vassar i learned to care
caring is a prerequisite for this class i have to teach in this
show up on time
larry gets a eye on that care
and stay awake the minutes three dawns a week i have to be here or i will fail you and not care
a name on the board my name is ms
not tie knot
you will each address the class on wednesday
pinedo has panic in her eyes
public speaking terr fies her
dibiasi raises his hand
tainot glares at dibiasi
glares and glares at him
uh tay knot
who are you
friends call me nomad
only two days before i gotta get up and give my address
you may be dreaming
why are you here steve
counsellor busik said this class would change my life
dibiasis cell phone rings
i gotta take this
mercedes tainot may kill this kid
an actual classroom but in sad shape
in one section sits lala pinedo from the speech class
larry sees her and sits next to her oblivious to the fact that she is cripplingly shy
look at us in two classes in a row
tainot is something else isnt she
im new to this coll ge life and i confess she sca es e this whole place scares me
i woke up this morning so nervous about the first day of school
i changed my clothes three times
we may have noticed talia francesco a very stylish young student come in and sit nearby
no notebook or anything
larry crowne and im babbling
i am lala
i order you to turn off all cell phones smart phones and any phone like devices
the teacher comes in dr
you have entered the knowledge zone
holding it up written by
ed matsutani phd
read this book follow into the promised land
he laughs mock that usually scares people
yet none of you have fled
a good economic indicator
larry leans over to lala
i like this guy
much like the other
four students sit waiting for class to begin
mercedes has already written up on the board in happy letters english shakespeare as politician
i but no one else is showing up
the clock shows
mercedes tainot what happened to the sign ups
shakespeare as i know him
larry is filling up his car watching his money go down his gas pipe
a body builder on a scooter a guy we will come to know as dell gordo pulls in to the opposite pump
he flips up the seat pops the pump into his scooter tank and in seconds is done
that scooter only sips gasoline
off dell goes while larrys tank fills and fills and fills
larry is walking from his house over to lamarrs
lamarr pipe in mouth is forever arranging his goods
whats cookin joe college
paying for gas getting to school
you ever come across a moped or a scooter for sale or trade
lamarr stops in his tracks
come with me
patience is at her home office card table
computer on ebay
your next wife might stand smoking that pipe in the house but your first one says uh uh
on the old tv on wheel of fortune a person
passing through woman
lamarr goes through the patio doors to the back yard a space filled with even more yard sale items
larry crowne been thinking about you

larry watches vanna white turn letters he solves the puzzle
thats going to be you someday
shes pulled up some lps on ebay on the computer

if you can part with them theyd go for something on the ebay
ill show you how
from the back patio lamarr comes in pushing a scooter in not too bad of shape though its windscreen is faded
this what youre talking about
thats a hunk of junk
this is classic
it doesnt work
it will for eight hundred dollars
gonna be a long night with you two
the secret of any negotiation is for both of us to win talk to me how much do you
larry is carrying his flat screen tv wires box and all from his house to lamarrs garage
wing ding ding
goes the scooter lamarr has been working on with his tools
he lets it idle as he takes the tv
ill throw in a helmet
tires are low
youll need a special license
larry straps on the old beat up crash helmet dot approved
all i need is the open road
larry revs it crashes into a hedge
you break it you bought it
it still works
talking about the hedge
images of an erotic super heroine busty and hot and others are being studied and saved one after another
dean tainot is a self published author and blogger with a taste for this kind of stuff
multiple copies of his own books line the shelves
when he hears the front door open he panics
whos home early
he keeps clicking away with the mouse until hes safe
mercedes calls from the other room
he covers his digital tracks and hops out of his desk
mercedes is prepping the margaritas for cocktail hour
first day of term calls for a celebration
youd think so
whats your burden this go round
and speech at sunrise i built a flamethrower of a posting for warriorweb which if i do say will feed nicely as an outline for as the blender blares husband
and wife eye each other
shes looking at him
hes smiling like a guilty idiot
carrier second angel

she starts pouring

she takes a nice pull on that icy drink
i saw some erotica
im a man i admit it

she bangs her head
everyone hides something
i have no secrets from you
i share the whole miserable slate
you walked in the door pissed off because im sorry ive established a beach head in new media while you still have to teach at vassar of the valley
you hide that
you look at bra busters triple x expecting me to pretend i dont know or i dont care
i do both and dont like it
it may look like i dont work hard around here mercy
but i do
im just a guy whos a guy being a guy when youre not around
she walks away
and walking away is great for a relationship
its a tiny slab but there is a tree and a fence and a
mercy closes the sliding door behind her and settles into her chair and into her drink
this is where she goes when she thinks drinks
rap rap rap on the glass door
its dean making one last point
im a guy
whos a guy
being a guy
mercy turns her face to the sky
the streets are not yet crowded with traffic
a motorcycle rider pilots a state of the art street machine machine helmet leather pants and jacket radio in the helmet saddlebags windscreen
probably a gynecologist
the cyclist pulls up right next to larry crowne riding a scooter for the first time
gives the passing rider who couldnt care less a thumbs up
how you doing
speck tack alar
where you headed
im a student
what do you do
im a gynecologist
id say have a great day but that would be stating the
the light changes
you take care
as the rider takes off larry tries to do the same but he stalls the engine
cars honk horns at him
larry is trying to work the kick stand of his scooter
he is not yet practiced at the thing
another scooter rrives
whered you get the hot wheels
talia is shaking her hair free from her helmet
larry fails to recognize her from econ prime
that machines a classic
got me here for a nickels worth of gas
youre in matsutanis econ with me
that class is straining my coconut
its only been one day didnt know you scooted
new to the sport
pulls out mobile phone give me your number
ill introduce you to like minded enthusiasts
with an e
i dont think so
i used to be kathleen but one day i looked in the mirror and saw a girl named talia
then in her phone putting you in as lance
check your texts and well do us some scooting
gotta tell you lance
tucking a polo shirt into khakis makes you look like a cop
not much fashion sense
gotta change that
larry sees mercedes tainot walking from the faculty lot and doesnt want to be late again
then get going
talia watches him go
likes him thus far
mercedes is at a desk in the back
bored and yes a bit hungover again
you can tell by the way she takes long pulls from her thermo cup
busik is sitting in on the class not far from mercedes
in front of the board that says phones off
calimeris is demonstrating an exercise for her speech
with the push up added the count burpie becomes the count burpie and works out the pecs and biceps
its an all in one exercise perfect for cheerleader conditioning
the class is too shy to applaud though busik claps like a fan
we now all know how to burpie
no one volunteers
though pinedo is about to
make me the bad guy
you mean me
larry goes to the podium armed with a huge stack of x s
busik shoots him a thumbs up
he looks at mercedes for the starting cue
my presentation will be on the subject of a very particular procedure
how to make french toast but ill speak english
larry has used up one card
mercedes rolls her eyes and talks to herself in a movie device way
m classes were once filled with e rnest young men ready to learn all i had to teach them
cute boys fresh out of high school who all had crushes on me from day one
now look at my cadre
bound for jail
treating college like another tour of combat
if this was hamlet hed be osric in act
the part that is always cut
larry checks on ms
tainot in the back
she is not talking only listening the movie device mentioned above
busik i am going to kill you
you cant suggest these saps take shorthand or oral hygiene
bring me in at this ungodly hour for minutes on french toast
busik looks at mercedes signals a not bad eh
she is a stone face
most people think syrup comes out of a plastic bottle
still talking to herself great
the history of the sugar maple tree now
thank you wikipedia
larry still has a dozen cards to go
but the speech is over
mercedes tainot contd ah ooo gah
that went fast
breakfast may never be ready
larry gathers his cards
busik gives him a bravo
pinedo tries to volunteer to go next
but you arent going to like it
are you clairvoyant
holding a pack of toaster
brown waffles in toaster at lightest or lowest heat setting
an adult should supervise heating by children
mercedes rolls her head
busik laughs out loud
an incomprehensible powerpoint graphic is projected with dr
explaining what it means
larry is taking notes beside lala when his phone vibrates
he flinches to turn it off before getting into trouble
on his phone a message talia scoot
it takes a moment for him to understand what is going on
his phone buzzes again
to your right larry looks as instructed
he sees talia phone in hand miming riding a scooter you and me wind in our hair
another text talia lance
look larry gets it
turning back he finds dr
matsutani standing over him
your mobile please
larry hands it over
i will return it after class if i dont crush it first
some of the scooter gang have assembled as larry and talia walk up
dell gordo and stan are talking about todays route
dell gordo plants a kiss right on talias lips
she kisses him back
larry sinks a little
it only figures talia would have a boyfriend like dell gordo
this is lance corona
classmate and good guy so far
you want to ride with us
there is a beat of a stare down between dell gordo and larry but then dell starts to snap his fingers snap
the other join in until they are all snapping fingers like the jets vs
snap along lance or you cant join the gang
larry clumsily starts snapping too
after a few bars
youre in for a trial run
and just like that everyone goes back to their wheels
not many of these wasps left around
they had low torque
hows the torque
he means larrys scooter
i just bought it and ride around
someone yells saddle up
stan knows engines and junk
lets go sweets
we ride monkey
larrys heart breaks a tiny bit suffering as he does from talia on the heart
the squad pulls out through the cars of the parking lot with larry trying to speed his machine along with the crowd
they roll through town a multi wheeled dance troupe
slow motion sometimes
they make riding look fun
being in a group a gas
rolling with the wind in your hair something youd like to do
as larry and the squad pass it by larry cant help but eye the place he once worked
he sees staffers collecting carts in the parking lot
he misses that place
after many shots riders begin to peel off scooting done
talia waves at larry who guns his throttle and pulls even with her
talia contd you good lance
other than school i have nothing to do
lets troll buena vista for junk stores
we hit those last week
if it was saturday wed look for yard sales
i know where a yard sale is like everyday
lead the way
lance knows a yard sale
follow me boys and girl
the scooters pull around the corner
were being invaded
one by one the scooters park and survey the scene
the stuff that larry was selling is now part of lamarrs operation being sold on consignment
larry what kind of thugs you get in with
if theyre college buddies why arent they in college
you have any old clothes
speak to my bride inside
dell gordo stan and the others are going through hardware tools appliances
these tv trays are too much
bargains at apiece
are you nuts
im joking kid
lets get to haggling
a buck apiece
ninety nine dollars apiece
see how this is working
two bucks apiece
ninety eight and kid i do this every day
talia and patience are putting outfits together from off the hangers
add this belt
i love this
where did you get it
reeled it in like tuna from the atlantic
diamonds in a diamond mine
you and i are going to spend some time together
larry stands alone nothing to do as the scooters poke about the sale
he drifts towards his house a forgotten man
he is entering some of his choice rare lps up for auction on ebay
i gotta see chez lance
entrez vous sea food plate
talia enters and looks around
the decor screams out a man lives here
no sign of a woman around here for years
drape a scarf over that lamp and youll soften the light
no tv b t vinyl disks of music
you trying to seduce me
she examines the record collection
no artistic chaos for you
she closes her eyes and picks out an lp at random
spin this platter mr
as he puts it on talia drifts into the
nothing matches but it is well equipped with a cozy breakfast nook
did denise make you breakfast in here with a little apron and lipstick perfectly applied
i did most of the cooking actually
you know about denise
patience thought she was stuck up and seriously fleeced you
larry cant believe his neighbors are so loose tongued
so what happened there my lance
the usual stuff between three people
she must have been pretty
fair haired or dark
how about a demonstration
he means of the kitchen
stay outta my way
chopped veggie salad
lightly fried potatoes
a pounded chicken breast
beer in a bottle
talia eats as larry gets corn bread he steamed fresh and moist onto a plate
cooking for friends is sort of fun
three hundred times a day is not
that corn bread i smell
dell gordo has walked into larrys house
dell gordo dives in after helping himself to a bottle of beer from the refrigerator
lance made all this
you should have seen him
he was like
talia does a mime of larry cooking like a spastic drummer
youre like uncle ben or something
stans working on your bike
larry goes to the window
said the thing was a time bomb
hes saving your life
stan has broken down much of larrys bike using lamarrs tools
lamarr is standing over him pointing out what he thinks needs to be done
stan is ignoring him
lets go lift iron monkey
its a shoulders and arms day
lance raise your right hand and say something patriotic
larry does just for fun
well be right back after these messages
youre in the street patrol
a full time mission for beauty and justice
talia throws her arms around him and kisses him on the lips no romance at all but still
what a fool
you a e way cooler than you appear
dell gordo lingers
all men fall in love with talia
you will too if you havent already
but i love her the most
know that right now
dont make me keep my eyes on you
whats your real name
look each other in the eyes
no contest but firm
one word lance
neighborhood kids are in school uniforms heading to the bus stop
dressed for school as well larry kick starts his scooter now a humming bit of mechanical perfection
speck tack alar
he peels out on his way to school
lamarr and his percolator give larry a wave
larry walks to speech like any other student
even business can break down into a shakespearean five act structure
frances taylor briegh is a former student of mercedes with braces on her teeth
her name is printed in perfect block letters behind her on the board
she is giving a polished well prepared off the cuff presentation dynamic seminars act i inventory
what do you sell
reach your buyers
three legs of accounting
plan to grow
what do you clear on bottom line
in other words to be or not to be
its all nonsense but it looks nice in powerpoint form
larry is taking notes
calimeris has drawn her pyramid of ideas
mack sleeps with his head straight up
pinedo is listening intently counting the ideas out on her hands
dibiasi is doodling drawings of football players
for business social and self improvement workshops email me francestaylor briegh
mercedes tainot is in the back her mind far from her classroom
she is preoccupied
the applause for the speaker jolts her
did you notice
so it can be done
the class breaks up
pinedo makes it a point to pick up some dynasem brochures
larry remains scribbling notes
white siler and koss you are up next time
you did good fran
anything for the woman who brought out the public speaker in frances taylor briegh
i used you as a focal reference but you werent there for me
whats wrong mercy
mercedes signals frances not yet then points to larry still finishing up his notes
i broke up with the orthodontist
now i have to get a new boyfriend and a new orthodontist
you ever do that
get crushes on people you see every day after ignoring them and then find out theyre creeps after all
can you move along
that was a great presentation
i learned a lot from it
the women watch him go
as soon as hes out the door ethels here lucy
whats going on
when was the last time you looked at your life and saw nothing but fraud and desperation
youre an idol to me
hearing you talk like that is crushing my dreams
mercy wants to take it back
well im joking of course
she pretends to laugh
a little too much
matsutani is diagramming on the board
if the balance on axis a is the same metric as axis b youre in deficits because of overhead taxes and re investment
breaking even is not making profit its a theoretical assumption
economics abhors an assumption
talia is amused while sizing him up from shoe to collar
pleated pants too short
someones been reading my book
the break even paradox creates a new metric
talia makes a decision and palms her phone punching in a text
in a second larrys phone vibrates
he struggles to get it before he gets caught with his mobile on
larry nods at talia
turning back dr
matsutani is there again
larry hands him his mobile phone again
palm out again
matsutani contd i am growing tired of this game mr
larry and talia
scooting along like elvis and ann margret in viva las vegas
they swing into the complex
talia is unlocking the grate
so what happens here
re invention big boy
i have no idea what that means but you betcha
pitch black as the grate rolls up and open revealing talia larry and their parked scooters
the place is crammed with vintage clothes
racks and boxes and stacks of every fashion
you got inventory
she disappears in the back rummaging around
i started in the smallest unit
this is just sitting here
this is unproductive capital
sell it on ebay
no one should ever buy clothes off the internet
you have to feel the fabric and test the drape
what is all this worth
out she ome with an assortment of mens clothes
a lot to me
try these on
fashion is no place for modesty
this is a service to humankind lance
it hurts me to see a top cat dressed like an ex hockey player
you gotta look gorgeous from shoe to collar
larry is taking off his pants just as dell gordo has pulled up on his scooter
thought you might be here
my boyfriends here

larry in fact has his pants off
dell gordo has a look in his eyes of well what the fuck
she is driving home

these calls are monitored to guarantee customer satisfaction so im hanging up before my supervisor comes on
raul is sitting at the counter doing his paperwork
perry comes up to him

those two over in booth
two guys in suits
i piped thei badges and everything
what is homeland security doing here
raul looks back in the kitchen
carlos and nick are prepping their stations
raul bolts for the kitchen
in seconds we can see him through the service window
he whispers and gestures to carlos and nick who suddenly show panic in their eyes
they now bolt the kitchen out the back way
perry is po ring coffee for the agents making small talk as
out side the window carlos and nick are fleeing for their illegal alien lives
larry is still trying to makes sense of his money woes when his phone rings
caller id perrys coffee shop breakfast all day
perry is serving hotcakes to the agents while raul is on the phone
this is larry crowne
get your ass down here

larry is scooting to perrys
the place has filled with customers
perry is jammed and behind the window raul is slapping orders up in a frenzy
were swamped kimosabe
get back there
youre late on your first day
larry comes through the swinging doors
he stops and takes a breath
his life has come to this
he is back in a kitchen
what can he do but dive in
larry is at the window putting up orders and ripping slips off the wheel
not so much as cracking a smile though
where you learn to turn eggs like
the uss coral sea

mack is at the podium giving a presentation with his star wars action figures
these are not toys
nobody plays with these
these are kept behind glass so no way am i passing them around today
mercedes talks to us and herself
wait a ding dong minute
counts the heads
someone is missing
who cut my class
she lets slip out loud wheres larry crowne
everyone looks at her
guess larrys out today
anyone know why
he didnt call me
ad libs no one knows why larry is out
i dont believe this
he ditched me
larry crowne you are on my shit list
everyone shares looks like theyve witnessed a lovers spat
speaking quietly in their seats
sounds like teacher has a thing for a teach ee
when you were out last week she said nothing
i think she has a crush on larry crowne
i do too
off their looks hes a nice man
mack speaks up
should i continue
tell us more about your man dolls
mack is humiliated now
im sure everyone recognizes boba fett
matsutani is in mid lecture when larry comes in late
im sorry im late dr
may i still sit in the class
this is college mr
the only thing you cant do is smoke in the building
hand over your phone
im going to ask a question in a moment
i want someone other than you to answer it i dont care if the silence is positively arctic
larry moves to take a seat
talia cant believe his choice of dress
she mimes to him whats with the outfit
his mime answer is unintelligible
this brings us to a dreaded task to every corporate entity
what is the purpose of semi annual re purposing
matsutani stares fear into the hearts of all but larry
to upload market differences without
without mooting the quarterlies
then say it
just give the answer
you know it
lala pinedo clears her voice
but still whispers
ing terly predicts
no one understood that
i know what you mean but please share it with your classmates
to upload market differences without mooting quarterly predictions
does this affect the value index
only the profit markdown
someone is doing the reading
lala pinedo beams
mercedes tainot is crossing campus when she sees larry
talia is moving around his hair showing it to a scooter quad hair stylist
lala is weighing in with her opinion on larrys hair
is that larry crowne
you have a lot of nerve showing your face on campus after ditching my class
im sorry ms
i will not miss another class this i vow
vows come cheap larry crowne
youll lead off next assignment with three minutes on a personal first
a story with details not a laundry list or slide show
and as i told dibiasi no one wants to hear about the first time you got laid
she eyes talia with venom in her eyes
or the most recent
talia laughs out loud
that woman is one clenched fist of fury
noisy kids squirm and cry and play games as they get haircuts from other stylists
larry is in a chair meant for toddlers
the scooter squad hair stylist is cutting his hair
talia is taking larrys shitty velcro wallet and putting his stuff into a cool used leather one with a chain
she must not be having any amok lovin
that makes me cranky too
without a workout in the inner sanctum a few times a week i cant concentrate
inappropriate subject in mixed company
for girl talk this is nothing
you you want to fix it with your teacher
talia slides a photo of herself making a face into larrys wallet then adds a condom in its foil
youd kill two birds in one bush
nothing wrong with a campus romance
otherwise life is what
breakfast work coffee school lunch scoot class shop talk mexican food a movie glass of wine or two then bed
thats not living
not without some smooching time
bet shed give you an a plus
if youre any good
she and the stylist crack up
larry pulls in
larry has filled out a bunch of papers and is sitting down with laurie gammelgaard who offers him coffee
more complimentary coffee
complimentary coffee is usually lousy
i drink it all day
i got a job
perrys coffee shop
breakfast all day
and im going to school
at east city
from the papers larry this doesnt change anything
i was afraid of that
the interest alone will eat up your service industry salary
you said come back in a few weeks
its been a few weeks
i will personally take this to my supervisor and fight to get you the loan you need
but you know how complimentary coffee is always lousy
your chances are too
i cant make the payments on the house
im going to lose it arent i
stop with the gloomy puss
youre doing everything right
hang in there
you still have a friend at riverbank
you guys are forced to say that arent you
coming down in buckets
talia has the grate up wrapping a new outfit for larry culled from her supply
dell gordo is in a rain slicker
i think its letting up
its going to storm till next year
we cant stay here all day
find a raincoat and lets get a little wet
i do not scoot in the rain
how you going to get to school then college co ed belle
larry pulls up in his karmann ghia top up
look at your new schmatas
hopping in to dell stay dry sweetie
dell gordo is not happy to see this
it is raining
mercedes car is out front
i got engaged to a teacher writer with two books in print
the windows are fogging up
frances and mercedes sip take out coffee and eat glazed rings of death
i never read them
im married to an ex teacher turned blogger with two books in print
and oh yes he has the libido and internet access of a year old
i had a boyfriend who owned every movie sophia loren ever made
i d hear a dvd go into the playe an knew what i was going to be doing in a half hour
right next to them larry crowne pulls up in his karmann ghia with the top up and talia in the passenger seat
once more to divorce court to cashier a spouse line my cloak with alimony and do myself homage
iago to roderigo
talia jumps out and runs into the donut shop
why cant all my students be like y u
because as i learned in your class i am one of a kind
larry rolls down his window and yells something funny to her
he never sees mercedes or frances
hey that guys in your class
mercedes wipes fog off the window
talia is talking to the donut shop lady selecting crullers and old fashioneds
and that toy poodle he keeps on a leash
mercedes eyes larry in his car
thats why hes in college
to get laid
talia comes running out with two coffees and a bag of donuts hops into larrys car and they pull out as talia puts a ring of sweet into his mouth
mercedes rolls down her window and yells
you are everything thats wrong with america larry crowne
they did not hear her
larry is at the podium prepping his personal first presentation as the class comes in
he is dressed as talia styled him
larry crowne i didnt know you were gay
youve gone all project runway on us
mercedes enters eyeing larry with residual venom
he is oblivious
she takes her listening post in the back of the room as the class goes quiet
should i begin
mercedes signals yeah go ahead asshole
first crossing of the equator
talking to herself in the movie oh shut up you sleaze
look at the new pants
they actually fit
and that jacket is smart
did busik put larry crowne into fashion for creeps
an old goat dressed like lamb
its that doe eyed young thing hes been wearing on his sleeve
dressing like hes half his age
give me a shotgun
ill pepper larry crowne right now
am i being unfair
i mean if i were single and some young buck took to me wouldnt i be inclined to diddly dally
she looks at dibiasi who has snuck ipod earbuds onto his head is mouthing the words and playing air guitar
the class erupts in l ughter
mercedes wasnt paying youth wouldnt be the only requirement of course
attention to hear larrys bon mot
jerking out buds what
what he say
unless youre looking at a chart you dont even know the equator when you cross it
a repackaged larry crowne wont fool me
shame on you
going after jail bait you criminal
insert viagra joke here
herself at you
dont let up
mercedes pretends she heard every word
anyone recall anything from that
that larry believed there were signs on posts marking the equator
and that when its a first time they make the rookies dress in drag and sing abba songs
mercedes missed a lot of that
everything in f ct
larry worked on an aircraft carrier
night carrier landings are the trickiest flying in world
mercedes is learning this for the first time as well
that was a memorable nugget
larry was stationed in panama
my father is from panama
koss to the lectern please
more anecdotes come from the class about larrys speech
mercedes heard none of them
talia is riding alone
she slows at a tattoo parlor
larry bangs out orders
raul sits at the butchers block sipping coffee observing his new kitchen staffer
an empty store right next to the tattoo parlor
talia is looking through the window
a hand drawn sign with an arrow says for lease enquire next talia smiles
her mobile rings its unique ringtone
webster and palm
larry is slapping orders together at the same time he h s his studies out trying to do two jobs at the same tim his mobile phone vibrates
he punches in cant
he goes back to his studies just as another order comes up
then his phone vibrates again
talia and the scooter gang pull in
in they pour sizing up the place for a hangout
talia stan minus dell gordo and others sit at the counter where they can see larry
steam us some corn bread
the others pretend to be grumpy diners feed us
whats a reuben sandwich
wheres my sanka
up comes order after order
hot beef sandwiches
woman on deck
raul looks up from his spanish language newspaper
you cant come in here

talia hops up to sit on a butcher block
this is my kitchen and i am the boss

rauls my boss yeah

tough but fair too
as boss do you make up the menu
but i do the purchasing

it makes me crazy you kidding
but its gotta be done every day or guess what
ill show you how much i gotta do
and just like that talia has seduced another man
telling her the secrets of purchasing orders s fries into the deep fryer
talia is with perry at the register
shes seduced him now as he goes over the menu and what sells more than ever
breakfast all day see
from corn flakes to popovers
we make the best chicken fried steak outside of a truck stop
can lance take a break
the artist formerly known as larry
i need his expertise
perry signals to larry then to talia and makes a talking gesture
larry and talia sit
she has her notebook out sketches and ideas and forms
square footage at this price is a bargain
maurice says im saving his life by renting the space
this is your matsutani delta number
you net this every month you cover overhead and the rest is profit
you make it sound so simple
talia is so excited she grabs larry and showers his forehead with kisses
appearing out of nowhere dell gordo
well back to work
dean is opening the car door for mercedes putting on the class act for a night out
he laughs at a feeble joke we cant hear
the guy is trying
they come right out the same door
theyve argued and drank all through the meal
dean carries extra cheesecake home in a dessert box
and oh theyve been drinking

dean screeches off into the night
mercedes picks up a rock and hurls it at him
im throwing rocks at my own car
janet and tony are aghast silent in shock
the jerk who just deserted me
my husband of friggin years
she stomps off into the night
janet and tony dont know what to do with each other now
mercedes is walking home
its a bit longer than she would like
she comes to a bus stop and studies the route
she sits and removes her shoes
i loved these shoes once
she sits at he stop about to cry
then she sort of does cry for so any reasons
in the distance we hear
the roar of scooters
then here they come
a night time scoot
all the regulars go by
somewhere in the mix are larry and talia
talia is just able to turn her head and see ms
tainot at the bus stop
larry is beside her
you are not going to believe how fate meets cute
she u turns and larry follows her confused
mercedes wonders who these mock wild ones are that pull up to her
he takes off his helmet
and ive been calling you lance
do you need a ride
and bust up your romp in the glen with bambi
bambi was a boy
i was heading home
were done scooting
i love riding in the night
away talia scoots to catch up with the gang
what do men see in irritating free spirits
mercedes starts walking
i offer you a ride
i dont want one
larry shuts off his scooter pushing it along with his feet ive yet to give anyone a lift on this but i think i can get you home with a
scraped elbow worst case
i am walking crowne as thoughts black boil up from my soul
major consequences sure to follow
youll read about them on parsectwelve
an attractive woman like you walking alone is a dumb idea
i need a man flirting with me right now like i need a dog crapping on my lawn
im hoofing it
in those shoes
mercedes ponders her shoes
hes got her
a man who notices shoes
ill be your cycle slut
put this on
strap your legs round my engine and
it wont be a terrible thing if you kill us both
aint you a ball of fun
larry kick starts the scooter and off they go slowly
are you really going to go this slow
i do want to survive this night
i have time to window shop
oh look a sale on tires at autousa
and here comes a mailbox
ive never noticed their perfect design and colo scheme
this is so slow a cat could knock us over
here they come at the speed of a lazy cow
mercedes is singing sixteen miles on the erie canal
larry shouts over his shoulder
where am i taking you
down to portola and left to havenhurst
havenhurst to palermo
right on palermo till i yell stop
i may use this as a presentation in class
try it and youll flunk
i am joking
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
i like your class
youre making us all do things we never thought we could
put the shovel away and just get me home kay
up ahead flashing lights
hail our citys finest
someones getting pinched
a cop car with its cherry top flashing has pulled over a drunk driver
theyre making him touch his nose breathe into a test kit
mercedes starts laughing
as they pass the crime scene dean is being put into the back of the prowler cuffed
mercedes laugh fills the night as they putt putt along
measure his dick officer
hes too diminutive to drive
tiny dick loser
larry doesnt know what to make of that
bad night for that guy
best night ive had in years
drive on mcduff
in through the gates come our night crawlers
larry shuts off the motor
mercedes is half asleep
she doesnt remember to take off larrys helmet
thanks for the ox cart ride
like a sleepwalker
stands at the alarm pad
i can see the alarm pad
i know the code
but my hands arent working
you dont want to give me your pass code
just hold my hand up to the numbers
ill manage from there
larry takes her hand and guides it to the pad
look away now
two two two two
larry heard every word
w eres my purse
the key please
its buried in that plant
larry digs out an altoids tin
why i think it is
ill get the door for you larry opens the door reaches in turns on the light
take one step inside and i call security
larry steps away from the door
and forget this ever happened
this whole sorry chapter tonight
you passing up gidget for a flat old coot like me
what are you talking about
what you have no short term memory
larry has been tying to be polite
when i say what it means i get it and have already purposefully forgotten everything
call it irony
irony is when gallant lands in the drunk tank while goofus scoots me home
she doesnt move but flashes her ring finger
can you not see that
i assumed you preferred ms
when we presume we make a pretty pair of asses of me and you or something like that
why arent you married
thats a long story and its late
she sticks her neck out
if this were a movie they might kiss right now
mercedes looks at him
hes not a bad looking guy
he starts to undo the helmet strap
i noticed something on the ride
you smell good
he gently removes the strap and helmet from her head
be a bit sexy
her hair tumbles out
do you have a crush on me
larry has no idea what to say
we all have crushes on you
even the gals
you want to make out with me you can
i know im not a third rate audrey hepburn wanna be but i still come on gramps
take this ride
my spouse wont be home for to years
larry ponders this moment for as long as he can
he shouldnt of course
she is mercedes tainot
its a pretty good whammy kiss
makes her splay her arms and everything
larry pulls back
after a bit though
she could have kept at it too
pretty dang good
i still got it no
yes you do
in you go
mercedes goes in close the door
larry hears the sound of the bolt
he walks away
mercedes leans against the door
what did she just do
goodnight whoever you are
whoever i am
larry wistfully starts his bike looking back at the door
he will not forget that kiss or this night
he drives off
a taxi is pulling up
out of the back dean looking like he
he pays the cabbie pissed off about everything
then his world gets much more complicated
all his possessions stacked up in front of the door
on the top of the heap his computer
turned on and showing porn oh jesus hell and tomorrow
mercy feels terrible stepping from her car brutally hungover
as she straightens up her eye catches
on his scooter
heading towards the scooter parking
she smiles a rare thing on a morning like this but the memory of last night warrants it
she heads in that direction
mercy is trying to accidentally run into larry but is caught by surprise when
he is walking right towards her
that would be uncomfortable
she ducks behind a pillar
still wanting to bump into the man who kissed her last night she circumvents his path stalking larry like a birdwatcher tracks a blue tailed swallow
hopping behind a tree mercys shoe gets caught in some mud
bending down a branch catches her sweater and rips a seam
stepping onto the pavement the tree branch smacks her in the head
still she keeps and eye on larry
staying out of his eye line mercy navigates her way around to the other side of the bench area and preps her appearance before making a degree reverse guaranteeing a
meet with larry
then she sees her
sitting with others greeting larry with laughter and hugs and hoots
talia is announcing to all how she left larry with a drunken teacher last night with her arm around his waist and affection in her eyes
for the obvious reasons sh s ill cant understand
she was hoping to have larry to herself for a minute or two
amid the others
oh come on
i left you all set up
what went down
a betty on your scooter after midnight
holding on her arms around you pressed against your back is a license to at least cop a feel
if we had ended up making out you still wouldnt hear it
talia slugs him
all in play
convinced larry is gossiping about last night mercy backs away from the scene and slinks away toward her class
mercedes is in the back wearing the darkest glasses allowed a teacher in a classroom hiding the fact that mercy is looking at larry
larry is listening to lala with delight
seeing them the northern lights the aurora borealis should have been beyond me but i was a little girl in coach class still awake a window seat a moonless night
somewhere over greenland with a shimmering curtain of emerald gossamer light dancing just for me
that is something i will remember forever
the speech is over
the class erupts in applause for lala who has hit a home run
foremost of the fans larry who rises in applause for the once quiet classmate
then the applause is over
the teacher says nothing
dibiasi that was a knockout speech lala
made the news
caused riots downtown
schools out til
the students look at each other shrug their shoulders and head ou
a moment please
why doesnt she just throw herself at him
this is bordering on harassment now
im watching the tv show
why doesnt this ever happen to me
i need a few moments alone with mr
crowne thank you
move along folks
privacys a right in this great nation of ours
you want i should close this door lock it and barricade it so you wont be disturbed
we hear them cackling like geese in the hall
how are the triplets
groggy puffy and grumpy
he means the hangover
last night was a confluence of too many things happening in too short a time span
last i ht
lets see what was i doing
ive forgotten everything that happened last night as best a gentleman can
i had no right to judge you or your relationships
date who you want
larry has no idea what that means
but what happened last night between adults was inappropriate
if gossip were to circulate the problem could be more than just embarrassing
my status as a professor could be tarnished
i wouldnt want that
with parking attendants
strangers at parties when ive had a bit too much of the demon rum
this was the first time with a student
i hope the entire thing will be forgotten
larry has just had his feelings hurt by his teacher
so there will be no bravado among you and your pals
thank you mr
id better scurry along to dr
i hope i dont have this same conversation with him
larry leaves a good mood ruined
mercy watches him go
what is going on behind those dark glasses
larry and lamarr are sitting on the curb watching kids play down the street
they run back and forth in front of them with a soccer ball
they both have pipes with lamarr showing him how to light up
i have to sell my car
put a new top on it
if i could afford a new top i could afford to keep it
whats the job paying you
half my unimart salary
youre down larry crowne
down as dirt
im looking back on the year denise left as the good old days
hang in there neighbor
everyone keeps saying that
i was in the same spot
look what happened
the odds of two people on the same street winning the lottery are worse than one person on the street winning the lottery
i read how the universe is expanding larry taking us along with it
that is a wild concept to grasp but what it means is we all have to hold on tight sometimes to get to where were going to be
this thing must be making me dizzy
keep your grip
youll be okay
its like the wife always says
shoppers pull up to lamarrs yard sale
the wife has a
a woman with a measuring tape
thats money in my pocket
a ball flies in and hits larry smack in the head sending his pipe flying
hardly any cars
shopping carts are herded into their corral by
former team leader larry crowne
larry stands where he was once king
the place looks different
he recognizes no one
no one is there to help larry pick out two for sale by owner signs
and he cant help it he straightens out some messed up racks and shelves
vasquez security is gone replaced by cubby the former janitor who is now the skinniest security guard in history
larry slides the signs for purchase
manning the thing
not looking good ind bargains today
how you doing
hurley looks at him
she looks tired
and stupid in her cashiers apron
why are you on the register
management execs are now required to put in hour shifts on the floor
just more hours
cash or unimart bargain card
like you have one of them
hurley is robotic
you got out of here just in time
thank you for choosing unimart where united we blah blah
a picnic table
and mercedes tainot writing individual words on pages of a steno book
after each word she folds each page many times and puts it in a basket
up walks dean tainot who looks neither happy nor cheerful
thanks for coming
just an email and a google map
i knew youd be on the computer
are we making a mistake here
we could change things
we could start right now
why should we
because we have history dean
but first my thoughts
ive got to address drinking
i should be able to comprehend and respond to both sides of our conversations
and the morning shower should be refreshing not a hangover cure
id like that too
youre not a pleasant woman after a few glasses
mornings with you are to be survived
dean is caught short
im what this is all about
there are plenty of items on the relationship agenda but lets start here
youre talking about you but you really mean me
i am not yelling or begging or saying you have to stop doing anything
so you dont get to either
im not saying that
weve both been here before
why prolong the process
i give up
this aint working
ill sign papers and checks see if theres enough for a cool sports car as a reward for the last few years and eventually i will be fine and you
but i am never once going to look at myself as another poor divorced guy who could still be married if only he had done the mea culpa bit for
all his faults
i just now came up with that and it is going to be my next posting
he pulls out his blackberry and makes a note to himself
i dont think there is anything else to talk about
mercedes looks at him
she has been a fool
mercy margarita pitcher handy is still writing words on paper and drinking
the sign reads finals week enroll for spring quarter
she is in the front of the class with a small box
a bit yes
here i have surprise topics
friday in a lightning round you must wax on that topic for minutes without pause repetition or lack of charm
one visual aid
ms pinedo draw
pinedo pulls a paper from the box
dibiasi draws a paper
what is that
who is that
its a guy from disrael
now its larrys turn
he shyly draws a paper a bit uncomfortable in class since the recent events
thats supposed to say communism
the handwriting is loopy
looks like consumerism
minutes on consumerism
hers is loopy too
whats this say
just pick another
matsutani is going on
larry is looking for talia who is not in class
at the end of each chapter is a study guide
master those and you will have mastered my book
master my book and you will take over the world
he laughs demonically
by now you should be laughing with me
larry cant believe talia is not there
larry scoots up
she is inside arranging a coming soon
dell gordo stan and the squad are all inside building shelves and racks
she comes out of the store
you digging what you see
you missed matsutanis class
review for the final
im done w th college
because im going into business
dont be a fool
stay in school
dont throw away your education
and dont drink and drive or do drugs and quit smoking and eat vegetables
maurice gave us free tattoos
i wanted something in japanese so check this out
she shows it to him just above her butt crack
its two japanese characters
that one says courage
that one says spirit
dell gordo knocks on the window as larry has his hands on his gals butt
whats this lance
japanese characters go the other way and that says soy sauce
oh shut up
quitting school is for dopes
it does actually say soy sauce
he is starting his scooter
be here for our grand opening
might not make it
i have finals
larry comes into frame with a hammer and stake
he is pounding the for sale sign into his front lawn
laurie gammelgaard pulls up her new vw bug with a couple in the back seat
they get out and larry nods as he waves them to the door
he remains on the lawn looking at his neighborhood the kids the dogs lamarr across the street
its all over
frances and mercedes have pulled up in her car
this place anonymous enough
as long as alcohols out of my grasp
they have good pie they say
sugar can replace tequila in my bloodstream my thighs and the folds in my neck
they pass a car prominently parked larrys convertible karmann ghia with a sign on its windshield for sale by so
youre a mess
they sit in a back booth where she would never see larry
youd think leggy blondes like us would be impervious right
at that moment larry crowne happens to come out of the kitchen to help himself to a cup of coffee
mercedes sees him just as perry comes up with menus
bring an appetite
the mark of a restaurant is their key lime pie
mercedes is surprised to see larry in a chefs hat
no key lime
cream pies i got
lady youre killing me here
ill have the french toast
on the menu breakfast all day
perry leaves to put in the order
you wont believe how far i fell on the hooch o meter
i have seen it happen a time or two
i kissed a boy
when third grade
one of my students
gimme the friggin details
hes not a minor is he
older than me
hugh hefner in your class
what went down
he sort of
he smelled nice
he a fireman who bakes bread
i wanted to be kissed so asked if he wanted to and he did
who is he
perry slides over a plate of french toast with one bite out of it
larry looks up from his econ
youre slipping larry
lady says its not french toast as she knows it
take it up with her
larry heads out of the kitchen
no shouting okay
this is a family friendly establishment
here comes larry not yet seeing mercedes
frances taylor briegh
you have a problem with your order
knock larry over with a feather
the student of yours
this is larry crowne
theres no way in creation i screw up french toast
it was fine actually
i wanted to see if it was really you cooking back there
and say howdy
during the following frances is trying to get a whiff of larry to find out how he smells
ready for the final
youll be the judge of that
the is a beat of silence
so your meal is satisfactory
would you let my boss know so i dont lose this job
shall i prepare you another batch
then i will return to my station
mercedes watches him go
you kissed the cook
i got a whiff
he smelled like bell pepper
look at the men in my life
blame it on the booze
and collect yourself
thats my problem
im a drunken hoor
larry comes back through the door humiliation wracking his face
he tosses the french toast down the disposal
mercedes and frances are attacking the house with vacuums cleaners and fortitude
books on shakespeare and shaw go on shelves where deans tomes used to rest
computer wires are not even untangled just chucked
the cupboard is open
where there was once booze go coffees and teas
music is playing as these girlfriends reconstruct mercys life
the street is empty
larry is on his scooter riding around and around and around the block that he will soon leave
he can see his neighbors through the open windows kids bouncing on a couch
a quartet of old folks playing cards and laughing
a movie playing on a big tv
this was larrys street
mercedes exits the door crisp clean like weve never seen her in the mornings
see the way she holds not clutches her thermo cup
hes wearing a zipped up jacket
kids and dog walkers pass as his scooter starts pronto he is off
the for sale sign on his lawn has an addition in escrow on the projected computer screen a portrait of disraeli
dibiasi is giving his speech but we are hearing mercedes
what a difference from day one
i must be a better teacher than i thought
dibiasi is nailing it
calimeris stopped up talking
lala you cant shut up
mack spoke about australia for three minutes and mentioned kangaroos only twice
and larry crowne
larry is listening to dibiasi wearing what was once his unimart polo with his nametag and everything
compared to the man he is now that polo looks out of place
i was tough on him
but he learned fast
how he connected the circle of sales to the expanding universe is impressive as hell
ill never forget about the value index now
he gave a perfect speech
instead of fighting me off that night what does he do but kisses me one and then all but tucks me in
what kind of guy does that to a loopy tramp like me
he could have ravaged me
i misread this guy and if i had a brain id find a way to steal him away from that cutie pie and keep him for myself
i wonder if hed like that if he would
what did i just say
what did i just say about larry crowne
the class has stopped
it seems that mercedes just said that last bit out loud and everyone heard it
the women eye each other
the men stifle laughs
and i was just wrapping up here
im so sorry
please go on
it okay if i get to my climax and denouement
if it was the romance novelist in him that made victoria the queen become such a pal chalk it up as another brick in the legacy of ben disraeli earl
of beaconsfield educator and prime minister of great britain
not bad for a jewish guy huh
dibiasi is done
not so much as a bump nomad
whyd you go last
fourth quarter dramatics
not that it mattered to my speech professor
congratulations all of you
whos the mvp mrs
can we vote
not me i have to stay objective
they all say lala
they start chanting her name
larry sits her down in her chair and gets the other guys to pick her up like shes the bride at a wedding
its a spontaneous party that mercedes has to back out of
as she leaves she looks back long enough to see larry crowne leading a parade around the room
everyone is taking the final
looking around the class
using his hands like a pair of binoculars
lala is using a thesaurus and dictionary to polish answers
larry is finished
he walks up to dr
and hands in his blue book
the first to finish
matsutani hands larry his confiscated phone
the final utensils are going into a box
larry is doing this part himself
he sits for a moment in the breakfast nook surveying his kitchen what was once his
mack comes in with a box of his lps
this is the last of them
damn you have a lot of records
priceless at a buck apiece
his furnishings are out on the lawn
lamarr and patience are looking them over
mack and dibiasi are putting the last of his things into macks huge suv and larrys car
a two bedroom apartment and you dont have room for your furniture
selling this futon sofabed
all those years across the street and youve learned nothing
whats the minimum youll take for this stuff
youll get me top price
you did learn
pizza at last
heres lunch as promised
the big stork pizza guy pulls up in a different car but the same sign
son of a cock
the pizza guy is none other than jack strang
this is irony
two extra large
one salad bucket
box of frosty cinnamon eggs
larry hands him the coupon and a twenty
i need two bucks back
times are tough
tell me about it
keep the change
larry watches him go
it almost was
i appreciate it
that could have been raul and perry are talking when they see mercedes tainot enter
my next wife just walked in
i love this business sometimes
something told me youd be back
is larry crowne working today
larry is arranging his station
larry your speech teacher has a question about the menu
larry can see her
she looks gorgeous
ill take the window even though im the boss of the whole kitchen
mercedes is having coffee
theres larry crowne
are you allowed to sit
where does perry get his coffee
i add chicory and a bit of vanilla
trick i picked up in the navy
youre probably wondering why i stopped by
well its to tell you your grade for speech
you killed on the final and have an a
way to go
she offers him a terrorist fist bump
with the hand that no longer has a wedding ring on it
actually everybody got an a but you got the special a where i tell you in person
didnt expect that
class is out

or mercy for short
just wanted to congratulate you

out of necessity
i hope you continue your education

who knows what ill hear with the extra sleep
my first class in college ever

you dont know anything about car devices do you
cars not much
mercy is opening her door starting her car
please enter your destination
oh be quiet
thats a mapgenie
it is hellspawn
in my old job id have steered you to a vortex unit
the mapgenie interface is clumsy and the menu needs too many inputs
he is reaching into the car across her to tap the unit
it was working fine
then i think i pressed too many buttons
the auto on feature is engaged
while he was doing that mercedes was smelling what she could of larry
she liked it
she looked at his neck his ears
and smelled him
how long was this broken
seemed like years and years
all better now
should be able to find your way
nothing to do now but say goodbye
they hear a pounding
raul is at the window inside the cafe signaling the break is over
back to work
thanks for the good news
perry greets him at the door
kimosabe holding off til after school to woo the teacher is the move of a class act
larry turns to watch mercedes drive away
the sign says new term beginning
ask about financial aid
did you notice
the cost of an education just went up
mercedes has just written care next to welcome to shakespeare
up on the board
and does a quick head count
only students are enrolled
shes going to lose this one again
clumps up the wooden steps are heard
calimeris mack pinedo and dibiasi come tramping in
twelve students now
on his phone i gotta get off baby or im in hot water with professor tai bo
mercy does a shakespearean dance of joy
is larry with you
should we track him down and drag him in here
mercedes does her best to hide her disappointment
seeing you all
i just thought
choose a seat and lets get started
the four smile at each other
carrying a torch for larry til it burns her hands
mercedes is walking to another building another class
she may not realize it but she is looking for larry crowne
busik is busy chatting her up
seriously chatting her up
all the excitement of first day of term i dont want to go back to my empty apartment
i need a drink and some talk and some wind down time
larry crowne is taking six units from me devouring the material like a starving man
hes continuing his education and tells me it is because of you
that your class changed his life
mercedes finds herself smiling beaming
larry said that about me
i put that guy in your class
so technically i changed his life
he is a good student
and handy on a scooter
is there any chance you would consider having drinks with an older faculty peer who holds a phd in economics
no offense dr
the rumor is you are newly single and i was just taking a shot
mercy looks right at busik
news travels fast
busik pretends he knows nothing
if youre going out im not doing anything
have you ever been to hooters
for the spicy wings yes
there is a note on mercys car
she takes it
to test your mapgenie harbor blvd
an a student
her breath catches in her heart
mercedes is driving
got it turning right
your destination is ahead on the right
that was a breeze
open for business with bunting and everything
talia is eating take out sushi and reading the soy sauce packet
she is tying to check out her ass crack tattoo to see if it really does say soy sauce
mercedes has arrived
talia sees her and comes out
lamarr is around
we might notice that dell gordo and larry now dress exactly alike as weve seen the same jacket once on lance corona
i love that blouse with that skirt but id show more leg if i were you
im mercy tainot bambi romp in the glen
looking for lance
youll see the stairs
the tattoo parlor
larrys scooter is right in front
as she goes
little higher heelsll get you wolf whistles
music is playing
a nice view is revealed as mercy arrives on a nice little porch
on a little table sits a potted plant
in the potted plant is an altoids tin
mercy gives it a rattle
in the tin a brand new key
mercy takes the key
slides it into the lock and slowly opens the door
the music gets louder
she cant see much into the tiny flat but she can make out
larry arranging the last of his stuff
mercy stands at the door until he sees her
when he does he says nothing
but steps to her and smells her her neck her hair
did you tell ed matsutani taking my class changed your life
i met you
damn fine whammy kiss
no larger than the nook of his old house
breakfast is being served
the most beautiful woman ever to wear a bathrobe has made french toast and is settling into the breakfast nook
larry crowne has his hair all on one side of his head post afternoon of amok loving
his arm shows a navy tattoo that may be old or new
mercy tainot glows in and out
she slides next to him close to him the meal is perfect
mercy is still in her robe riding on larrys scooter back and forth in front of the parlor and talias store
larry is having coffee sitting on the steps watching her ride back and forth
she is getting good
talia and the gang spill out of the store to watch her
hoots and laughter
larry uses his robe as a matadors cape mercy as the bull
as she passes under his flaring cape
