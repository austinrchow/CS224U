ii written by steven antin a series of tight close up shots of dancers moving in high energy fast paced sexy choreography
a kaleidoscope of images and colors
fade in sounds of people talking glasses clinking all the background sounds of a busy hip nightclub
a loud drum roll
camera is low moving through backstage passing curtains and the wings flying out onto a shiny black stage awash in light
push in on footlights which are now blinding us blasting into camera as they form the word
drum roll ends with a cymbal crash
the screen goes black
then we hear an opening music intro a bawdy quartet
extreme close up red luscious lips
speaking directly into camera in a smoky sultry voice
once upon a time
a long looong time ago
there was a good little girl
and they called her
a stunner with impossibly long lashes theatrical make up and a sequined skin tight band aid of a dress
she works the tight stage of the club toying with the audience
music blares from a hot young bumper band sax drums bass wearing bowler hats suspenders and lots of ink
the crowd hoots
lame streamers explode from the stage
some say she up and died of neglect
the clubs red booths are about half full with a hip crowd
walls cluttered with photos
celebrities tucked in shadows
but i say
no matter how hard you try you cant keep a good girl down
and ive got a bevy of em
a dozen gorgeous leggy girls fight for the mirror
miles of skin
heavy make up
oceans of them
its definitely decadent
come to think of it none of them are all that good which isnt all that bad
sean a cute gay guy with an armful of accessories pushes his way through the girls and in a blur tightens a corset tosses a boa adjusts a garter just
eight shows a week
sixteen gorgeous girls
thirty two towers of luscious legs
behind her our girls slink onto the stage one by one
say hello to scarlett
and georgie girl
the girls gather at the edge of the stage lit by footlights moving in place to the beat of the intro music
tess weaves playfully between them
all of them the creme de la creme
de la creme
the girls strike nasty but funny provocative poses etc
each one a bastion of bodacious
coco bends over peers between her legs elegance
two girls upside down on chairs nail aerial splits
not to mention their other
smacks coco on the ass ass ets
coco raises a brow moves her butt to a loud bump and grind
welcome to the burlesque lounge dead smack in the center of the sunset strip did i say strip
cat calls from audience i meant tease
footlights flare uplighting the girls
they shift their weight hitting the beats with risque moves and hip thrusts as they move downstage suggestively toward the audience to the music
a small grime streaked steel town hanging on by the skin of its teeth
boarded up storefronts a run down a p
camera moves past an old sign welcome to grundy
and lands on a broken neon sign that reads dwig s bar it flickers so you can read the name dwights
then goes back to dwig
old beer posters
a few pathetic customers
beer on tap
pinball standing lonely in the corner
a regular drains his beer tosses down a quarter and starts to leave
someone stops short at the table
uh excuse me
you forgot something
sees ali rose
one hand holding a bar rag the other planted on her hip
ali has a look thats all her own short shorts white platform sandals hair piled up high more make up than the rest of grundys women combined
shes young but has a confidence thats got nothing to do with age
no thats your tip
see now thats interesting you and i must do math completely differently cause me
i start with the six beers i brought you add the four spills i cleaned up the five times i refilled your peanuts plus the three times you accidentally touched
my ass then i tack on lying to your wife when she called looking for you twice and i come up with a sum thats a hell of a lot more than twenty five cents
before the regular can respond ali is joined by loretta s wearing every one of those years hard
shes just teasing ike
you go on home now and tell kay i said hi
the regular leaves
loretta picks up the quarter
its better than nothing
a quarters an insult
itll cover half a load down at the spanky clean
theres only one thing a quarter is good for
ali takes the quarter and heads to the back of the room passing a geezer whos sitting by himself drinking alone
oh no hon now you know how dwight feels about that
dwight isnt here
ali stops in front of the rinky dink karaoke machine
he could come back any minute
im not working here for the tips loretta
she pops the quarter into the machine and chooses a song
she picks up the microphone and after a few opening beats starts singing etta jamess somethings got a hold on me
and now we see where the confidence comes from
shes got a voice thats way too big for this town the kind that reaches way down inside you and rattles things loose
we hear the same song continue as we intercut with the girls undulate at the footlights as they sing the chorus in dwights bar ali is belting now
loretta is torn between enjoying listening and watching the door for dwight
on the burlesque stage the girls belt out a raucous chorus
as other entertainers appear onstage the insatiable la puccini triplets
death defying daredevils missy and kitten deville
the countess of contortion eva destruction
and how about a little love for those bad boys of burlesque our naughty bawdy bumber band
the tattooed band blares as the troupe kicks in unison
in dwights bar ali sings with a powerful vocal quality reminiscent of etta james sarah vaughn billy holiday
on the burlesque stage the girls and the band loud and bawdy
in dwights bar ali letting loose now
on the burlesque stage the burlesque girls move in a line toward the audience confident sexy
the bartenders waitresses and people working at the club sing along
in dwights bar ali letting it rip
the geezer sips his beer unmoved
on the burlesque stage the girls
in dwights bar ali
on the burlesque stage the girls form a line
in dwights bar ali sings
in the burlesque lounge the girls tess the other entertainers busboys waitresses bartenders and entire company do a big finish
in dwights bar ali finishes the song
the geezer unimpressed gets up and leaves
people around here wouldnt know talent if it bit em in the danglies
where you gotta go is des moines
they got karaoke bars where you can win a hundred bucks a night
loretta when i get out of this butt hole of a town i sure as shit wont be heading for des moines
she hops up onto the bar spins around on her butt one leg up in the air like a varga girl then hops down on the other side then gets
back to work
the audience is still applauding as the performers crowd into the backstage area squeezing past the puccini triplets preparing their act
tess comes off stage and bumrushes sean
where the hell is nikki
rehab if theres a god
the backstage door bursts open revealing
i heard that
nikki a stunning feisty brunette sashays in jesus nikki youre later than georgias period
where were you
weave wax paws and claws
she drops her bag quickly peels her clothes off holds out her arms as sean slips her corset onto her tess eyes nikkis body hold it right there
nikki unwillingly steps on the scale
tess shakes her head
put on five pounds or i bump you
nikki protests as sean double takes at georgia who flits by with a slightly protruding belly
ali winds her way through the trailers carrying a bag of take out with a swing in her step moving to music playing in her head
she reaches a double wide lets herself in
got your pot roast here
she comes in kicks off her heels
they were out of steak fries so i got you some of those
then she stops in her tracks
nanna s housecoat oxygen tank is slumped in her chair
the tv remote is on the floor
entertainment tonight is blaring
loretta and ali at the grave with a minister who looks to be about
a cemetery worker is nearby picking his teeth with a toothpick
dear lord we gather here today not to mourn but to celebrate the life of alison rose
then befuddled can i start over
ali rolls her eyes
the minister and the cemetery worker walk away leaving ali and loretta alone
you were real good to her ali
no she was good to me
she rearranges the flowers resting on the plot fixing it up
and she wasnt even my real nanna
she took me in for the checks
when i turned eighteen the money stopped coming
she couldve kicked me out but she didnt
she had a lot of pain at the end
nothing she talked about but i could tell
well then i guess this is a blessing
now shes free
on ali thinking realizing talking about herself yeah
i guess she is
nannas clothes mostly flowered housedresses are folded in paper bags
her belongings are stacked up in the corner
close on alis mattress as she pulls a wad of cash out from under it
nikki leads a group of girls in a raucous routine to honey rock
very moulin rouge
in the wings tess watches with sean
girls look good tonight
amazing what a pink spotlight can do
hides more cellulite than a burka
move in on ali as she counts the money
then she looks around the trailer and realizes tough shit
stuffs the money in a pocket then pulls out a suitcase
the burlesque girls tease the crowd
the suitcase as ali throws in her belongings
when its full she grabs a stack of records jazz and soul tries to fit them into the suitcase but it wont close
she picks one etta james
she sticks it in the suitcase and zips it up
ali reaches into a drawer pulls out a framed photo of a young woman s short dress heavy make up holding hands with a year old girl
ali slips it into the suitcase pocket
she takes one last look around the trailer
close on alis white platforms strutting down the street
dwight is at the bar s beer gut humorless
youre three days late
i had a death in the family
and what people stop drinking cause your grandma died
get your apron and get to work
im not here to work
i just came for my back pay
paydays the end of the month
but i wont be here then
and you owe me for three weeks
i dont owe anyone anything till the end of the month
ali sets down her suitcase and marches over to him
you know what dwight
contrary to what youve been told theres no law in grundy that says you have to spend every waking minute being a tight fisted cheap ass prick trying to intercede
ooh hon im not sure that particular approach is gonna ive spent three years of my life and youll probably spend another three
you want to quit
ill replace you before you hit the county line but i sure aint gonna pay for the privilege
he walks out the back door slamming it behind him
angle on the cash register
ali opens the drawer pulls out a wad of cash
peering out back to make sure dwight isnt coming in ali counts out some money
what are you doing
im only taking what he owes me
how much was that bike you been wanting for little keith
ali stuffs a few twenties into lorettas apron pockets the rest
ali where are you gonna go
somewhere i can breathe
now gimme a hug i gotta get out of here before he gets back
loretta hugs her tight then looks ali in the eye concerned
you cant just head off into the sunset without a plan
ali gives her one more hug then grabs her bag and leaves
ali takes off down the street
she passes two older women waiting for a bus
a beat as they watch her pass
then shell be back
as ali heads off we hear
ali is at the ticket counter
how much to los angeles
one way or round trip
youre kidding right
cabaret chairs as they drop from the ceiling
the girls catch them spin them around slam them down and land on them in the wings tess hands sean her corset as she slips into a slinky dress
he takes her cigarette holder and grips it between his teeth as he zips her in
theyre loving you tonight
theyre loving you
oh shucks i just tell myself im writing for a big old drag queen
as he heads off with her discarded costume a big old foul mouthed drag queen
tess looks in a mirror
as she makes the necessary adjustments vince scali appears
good show tonight
she glances up sees him
goes back to primping
too bad the clubs half empty
i got another call from marcus gerber
and you told him we werent selling
he wants to raise his offer
i told him wed hear him out
tess spins around looking him in the eye for the first time
vince i dont care what the number is the only way marcus gerber will get this club from me is by prying it out of my cold dead heavily jeweled
she pivots away and sweeps into the club
big finish the number on stage ends
alis on the bus in a seat by herself
a little girl in front of her is peering over the chair watching ali
ali smiles at her
the little girls mother notices gets the girl to sit down by tickling her
ali unzips the pocket on her suitcase takes out the framed photo of the mom and girl looks at it
then she looks out the window and watches america fly by as day turns to night
over which we hear someone channel surfing radio static ali sits with her radio headset searching stations as
broadcasting from hollywood and vine
ali perks up looks out the window as the bus rounds a bend and
the hollywood sign comes into view
new music up the rush of tourists and traffic
through a sea of people moving down the crowded sidewalk we find ali as she emerges through the crowd carrying her bags
looking around at this exciting city
she spots a shitty hotel with a sign
she looks up at it
then heads across the street cramped dingy carpet chipped paint
key in the door
the middle eastern hotel manager s leads ali in pointing out the features of the room speaking fast in an impossibly thick kurdish accent
ali nods along not understanding a word
when he stops okay
good luck with that
he drops her suitcase on the bed and stands there
oh hang on
she digs into her purse
all she has is twenties
she peels one off and holds it out
if i could just get a little but before she can finish he pockets it nods and leaves closing the door behind him
to the closed door change
she pulls open the blinds they fall off the wall with a crash
ali stares at them
then she opens the window
the sounds of hollywood pour in
she digs out her cash sticks it under the mattress
then she reconsiders
she removes the money takes a ziploc bag full of make up from her purse dumps the make up onto the bed seals the money up in the ziploc and
takes it into the bathroom
she lifts the lid of the back toilet tank and slips the ziploc of cash under it catching the bag in the lid as she sets it back down so
it wont fall in
she goes back into the main room to find a calico cat sitting on the window sill
it meows hops into the room
i thought this was a single
the cat curls up next to her
she checks his junk
first guy i meet is neutered
you dont happen to know anyone in the music business do you
ali sips coffee from a paper cup as she reads trades and want ads spread over the floor
she refills the lid of the cup which the cat laps up
singer songwriter singer scuba diver
on another ad it says singer waitress wanted
music up ali cruises toward the address dressed in her iowa best full of confidence
she rounds a corner and sees ali stops in her tracks
tougher competition than she was expecting
she heads for the back of the line passing girls doing vocal warm ups
one girl is belting out a riveting somewhere over the rainbow
just as ali gets in line the door opens and a skinny guy sticks his head out
sorry ladies thats all the applications were taking today
close on an ad dancers wanted
pretty girls only
ali circles the ad sips coffee
looks at the cat
i can dance
ali breezes in sees
a bunch of stripper poles seedy drunk guys in the audience
she pivots and walks right back out
as she leaves a drunk guy turns to a seedy guy
shell be back
ali enters full of energy as hot latina and african american girls in butt baring hootchie hip hop garb turn in unison and eye her in her denim shorts and
not her crowd
ali eyeing the ad sips a cup of coffee
looks at the cat
ali dressed like the girls at the video audition hootchie street opens the door to find classical bun topped ballerinas stretching warming up
a degas painting
they turn in unison and eye her
again not her crowd
gleaming in the california sunshine
ali stares up at the glittering shrine to recording
takes in the whole swirling crazy scene around her
ali wanders down the sidewalk chugging an iced latte
the strip hums with slick night life
expensive cars pull up to valets
hipsters swish past velvet ropes
ali moves through the throngs alone anonymous invisible
she passes a construction site for a story tall building all lit up guys working at night
a bus pulls out spewing exhaust
as the smoke clears ali sees across the street a beautiful statuesque girl standing on the landing of a fire escape under a street lamp beside a nondescript club
ali catches glimpses of her as the sunset traffic whizzes by full make up spangled burlesque costume impossibly high heels awesome
this is coco
coco makes the dirty streetlight look like a movie quality kleig
everything about her shimmers
intrigued ali looks for a break in the traffic and crosses the street
as she nears the club she hears a mans voice like i said look but dont touch
alexis drag queen door whore also in full costume and make up tosses a guy out the front door onto the street then heads back inside ali smiles to herself
then turns back to look at coco who disappears inside a back door as
nikki walks out
lights a ciggie
she has on full make up
lashes like peacock feathers
she sees ali staring
didnt your mama tell you its not polite to stare
sorry youre just so damn beautiful
in that case screw your mama stare away
nikki strikes a pose campy showing ali her best side
they both laugh
no one would ever guess
that youre a dude
nikkis face turns to stone
her eyes widen in horror
ali sees the mistake she made
shits right you little half wit nikki is about to unleash when the stage door opens
sean grabs her and drags her inside
as he does a strand of crystal beads comes off her costume falls to the ground
im really sor the stage door slams shut
ali picks up the strand of beads
holds them up in the light watching them shimmer
she goes to the front of club where a smattering of l
theres a glass display case full of photos of the acts
ali looks at the pictures of the girls in their elaborate costumes and provocative poses
shes unintentionally made her way to the front door
black curtains obscure her view inside
she peers in
hears cool music emanating
the sounds of a nightclub
she ventures inside
ali moves down a dimly lit hallway
more beautiful photos of women in elaborate costumes drawings sketches paintings clutter the walls
ali follows the photos down the hallway
muffled sounds penetrate the darkness people talking over each other glasses clinking
s berlin style music
alexis sits on a stool glaring down at her
what is this place
a strip club
honey i ought to wash your mouth out with jaegermeister
the only pole youll find in here is natasha the shot girl
ali looks back at the photos
babycakes shit or get off the throne i got a club to fill here
ali digs her id out hands it over
alexis scans it twenty bucks
ali looks in her wallet
sees one lone twenty inside
she hands it to alexis
he nods for her to go ahead
ali descends a staircase into the club
and is bombarded by colors chaos laughter scandal all shimmering as if someone dunked the place in glitter
and over it all an incredible mash up of old music with a contemporary beat tying it all together
ali enters rounds a pillar staring out into the room as a spotlight finds the stage where half a dozen ostrich fans smoother than honey and twice as sweet
each girl lovelier then the next
gentlemen hold onto your hats
ladies hold on to your gentlemen
we may not have windows
but we do have the best view on the sunset strip
music kicks in as lights flare from the back of the stage where three girls stand backs to the audience fosse style
coco georgia and nikki strut downstage
behind them girls move and dance on cabaret chairs
totally raunchy completely timeless
the girls hit the beats turning upside down on cabaret chairs arched backs legs reaching upward bending over asses to the audience bodies writhing in air tight choreography thrusting hips
whipping heads stomping feet
ali watches exhilarated as the music builds and swells to a full on performance with the entire ensemble get you a drink
a bartender is watching her watch
jack punky dark hair eyeliner one arm half sleeved with tats
only if youre buying
slides her a beer welcome to l
is it that obvious

but still under warranty

she looks back at the stage mesmerized

i thought you looked familiar
as ali sips her free beer jack stacks drinks on a tray for a ditsy waitress
he slides the tray to her
she doesnt notice
he barks at her hey
the waitress picks up the tray almost spilling the drinks then heads off
ali looks around the place wowed
they dont build em like this in iowa huh

she stares up at the stage marvels at the dancers
so tell me who does a girl flirt with to get from here
points to the stage to there
is this you flirting
with someone wearing more eyeliner than me
points across the club to a door leading backstage
ask for tess
shes your guy
as she heads off hey iowa use my name
he hands her a card
she looks at it thanks jack
she smiles slips it in her cleavage and heads for the door
ali enters into a frenzy
legs costumes boobs heels eyeliners all flying around like a flock of birds
in the middle of the maelstrom sits tess at a mirror quietly applying lipstick
im looking for tess
glued to the mirror so am i
and sometimes when the lights are dim and i squint my eyes
i can still see her
she switches to mascara
sean arms heavy with corsets catches eyes with ali nods toward tess thats her
ali steps closer to tess

tess glances at ali in the mirror
then goes back to her mascara unimpressed

tess stands a final check in the mirror
ali sees her chance okay i get that youre busy so i wont waste any more of your time but this place ive just never seen anything like it before
and i know i belong here
so how can i be a part of it
twenty bucks at the door can make all your dreams come true
tess strides out not looking back
ali sees the girls trading glances amused
she turns and leaves
the bumper band plays as ali makes her way back toward the bar dejected
across the room the ditzy waitress holding an empty tray flirts with a table of young hipster guys
ali sees another table of chic clubsters trying to get the waitresss attention
the waitress ignores them
ali sees the trays on the end of the bar
she grabs one goes to the table of clubsters clears their empties takes their order
she finds jack at the bar unloads the empties
one dewars neat one shot of patron and get this tough guy in the hat
he wants a cosmo
jack looks at her surprised
if im not times better than boobs for brains over there you dont have to pay me
weaving their way through the tables
widen to see she now wears a burlesque lounge cocktail waitress get up
she delivers a heavy tray to a table
she heads back to the bar with empties eyes glued to the stage where coco and the girls are dancing to wagon wheel watusi
as ali hits the bar coco nails a stunning kick
her leg went behind her head
yeah cocos the real deal

stifled giggles from the girls

nikki is about to haul off on sean when the curtain opens and whoomp
she turns flashing her best stage smile as she joins coco and the girls onstage in the sexy high energy fosse style wagon wheel watusi
from the floor ali serves drinks takes care of customers all the while watching the spectacle on stage mesmerized
the door opens
ali enters exhausted but on cloud singing tough lover to herself
when he kisses me i get a thrill
the cat meows and slinks out from behind the bed
ali pulls the crystal beads out of her pocket and when he does that wiggle i cant keep still ties the beads around the cause hes a tough lover
prince nez by squirell nut zippers plays as eva destruction dressed as a naughty sexy ballerina does a bawdy and technically flawless ballet number on a cabaret chair on pointe
on the floor ali delivers a tray of drinks to a table of music industry guys
one of them drops a bill on her tray
she heads back to the bar
as jack loads her tray up she stuffs her tips into her pocket sees sean looking her up and down
okay girl time for sean to give you a real tip
he ties her shirt up higher undoes the top few buttons
you got lips that could suck the chrome off a peterbilt but that matte is about as sexy as a bedpan
as sean wipes off alis lipstick then whips out a tube of lip gloss and paints away jack and ali share a smirk
sean steps back assesses his work
now baby go show em what you got
he heads off
while eva performs onstage ali delivers the drinks to a table of scenesters as eva winds up her act in a flurry of fierce ballet moves finishing to applause as
ali notices someone waving her over
boyishly handsome in jeans and a ringer tee
gold rolex status sneakers
when ali gets to him dewars on the rocks for me
bottle of dom for the table and tosses a black amex on her tray noticing her and tell nikki im here
ali starts away then and you are

the backstage pass to life
he sees coco walking by swipes the amex in her cleavage
she shudders then turns around and tips her ass up at him
he swipes the card again
now theres a first
jack sees ali laughing at their banter
she heads off with the tray of dewars and dom as the prince nez number ends
lights up on tess center stage as she begins a new number long john blues
a singing spoken hilarious interlude
the girls back her up
as she continues
on the floor nikki is sitting in marcuss lap nibbling his neck
vince sits down beside marcus
marcus pats nikki on the butt excusing her
as she heads off shes on the verge

theres a handful of these clubs around town i could buy one of them tomorrow
but it wouldnt be in the heart of the sunset strip
a rim shot and blast from the band as the audience laughs
from the stage tess notices vince shake marcuss hand and leave
a flicker of irritation nothing anyone in the audience would notice but its there
ali brings a tray of empties over
sean is there
jack gives sean his drink
he walks off
music up an insanely cool version of sly and family stone everybody is a star mashed up with a fosse esque burlesque rap
jack notices ali watching the stage
she lights up and melts enraptured by the girls as they vamp to choreography in a tight group
song continues over a series of shots in alis hotel room ali plops down a bunch of books opens the golden age of burlesque lays on her bed petting her
cat with her foot
she locks in on a photo of s era burlesque dancers over which we hear in the club burlesque girls strike a similar pose wipes down tables with jack in
the club after hours flips through old soul records at a used lp store pokes her way through the scruffy street folks that hang out by her hotel
on alis bed ali flips to a picture of mae west in the club tess cracks up the crowd in alis hotel room ali eats chinese take out as she
pores over the book
turns the page to a photo of old school acrobats over everybody is a star
in the club daredevils missy and kitten deville nail an
in alis hotel room ali in the bath still reading turns the page to a gorgeous image of josephine baker in alis hotel room ali vamps dancing to the song
in her room in a t shirt and undies
the cat watches her yawns and slinks away
in the club the burlesque girls thwack down on chairs
in alis hotel room ali thwacks down on an old mustard colored chair
in the club an overhead shot the burlesque girls now in different costumes in a busby berkeley cluster as camera booms down on them and they separate to reveal ali
center stage belting up at camera find ali in her waitress outfit watching the girls on stage lost in her fantasy
she catches herself then moves along serving drinks while the girls work the stage
the burlesque girls continue their burlesque rap
when the girls thrust out their hips in unison ali does too unconsciously dancing along with them
at the bar jack notices
tries to focus on pouring drinks but his eyes keep drifting to alis hips
nearby sean notices jack noticing
looks from jack to ali
eyebrow goes up
girls scurry sean fusses tess sits at the mirror applying a fake eyelash as we hear a surprisingly good womans voice belting a song
nikki do you even own a watch
or do you measure time in patron shots
ali enters with a tray of drinks
nikki swipes one
hey no thats for nikki opens a bottle pops pills in her mouth washes them down with the drink and sets the empty glass on alis tray
you i guess
nikki turns to the mirror and starts getting to work
as ali hands out the other drinks tess
do you have a second
tess doesnt answer
but a slight glance at ali in the mirror shows shes half listening
i was thinking see i grew up listening to all this music id play the records over and over fast forward babe
i gotta rebuild rome in the next two minutes now see thats what ive been thinking about
theres one thing i dont get
its the vocals
you have the girls lip synching
which is fine i guess but wouldnt it be so much better if they actually sang
the girls trade looks knowing alis overstepping here
ali doesnt feel the vibe shift surges ahead
ive been reading up on it and back when burlesque started thats what they did
all eyes on tess
oh no she didnt
tess slowly spins around in her chair to face ali
peers at her with a supercilious gaze
when burlesque started
searching her memory oh
this book said it came after
vaudeville is the word youre looking for
derived from the th century french expression voix de ville voice of the city
popular songs of the time that were strung together into stage shows
which over time gave birth to another kind of show in which talented girls showing a bit more skin danced did skits and yes sang
in addition to being raunchier these shows were funnier hence the new name
burlesque comical in french
ali sees the girls enjoying this dressing down immensely
tess stands peers down her nose at ali
i did my thesis on burlesque
its just its just that
i can sing and we can all sing
but they dont come to hear us sing
they come to see the best dancers in town backed by the greatest singers in history
then condescending but tell you what when you find someone with better pipes than sarah vaughn billie holiday and etta james you let me know
she sashays out leaving ali standing there with whats left of her dignity and an empty cocktail tray
the girls launch back into prepping for the show
ali pushes in pissed off and hears the sound of puking
she sees georgias boots sticking out from under the stall
you okay in there
the stall door opens
georgia comes out shakily with mascara smudged eyes sweet as ever
i dont know why they call it morning sickness when it hits at every freakin hour of the day
she rinses her mouth out at the sink
there arent many women who could dance the charleston on a chair at what are you three months
georgia turns sideways to the mirror inspecting her bump
can you believe my boyfriend hasnt noticed yet
you havent told him
i guess as long as he doesnt know i can still imagine hell be happy about it
looks in the mirror oh my god look what the cat dragged in
she gets to work wiping away her smudged mascara
you look pretty hot to me
georgia reaches into her corset yanks one breast skyward then does the same to the other
yeah well you take what mother nature gave you and milk the hell out of it right
coco enters carrying a glass of tonic for georgia
shouldnt you be on the floor
i had to pee
is that okay with you
not when youre blocking my mirror its not
ali sees shes in the way
as she steps aside re
the music thats us
you okay or are you gonna puke on me during the number
i cant make any promises
coco drags her out leaving ali alone
ali looks at herself in the mirror
reaches into her shirt and does the boob hoist that georgia did
ali trudges up the stairs tired
suddenly two young thugs barrel down the stairs past her almost knocking her over
they tear past her
she shakes her head reaches her landing heads down the hall toward her room then sees her hotel room door ajar
the lock broken
she runs down the hall
ali rushes in goes straight into the lid is off the toilet tank
her ziploc of money is gone
god damn it
she looks out the window sees the robbers running off disappearing down the street
she kicks the trash can
it flies across the room
damn it damn it damn it damn it damn it
she sees the cat watching her from behind the bed
a lotta help you were
the cat creeps out slinks around her legs
ali plunks on the bed
then she sees on the floor the photo she took from nannas
she picks it up
the glass has cracked tearing the picture
she takes the picture out of the broken frame smooths it out then looks around her trashed room
follow a motorcycle up the street
the driver has a keyboard on his back
he parks gets off takes off his helmet
he heads for his apartment but slows when he sees ali sitting on his steps her bags at her feet
she tries to speak but cant so she just nods
cause in my experience when youre on someones doorstep surrounded by everything you own theres usually a not so good story and as she expected as soon as she talks
she starts to cry
halting gaspy sobs came in busted the lock and stole all my mo ney ey ey ey
she sobs trying to talk with high pitched squeaks only heard by birds
jack winces trying to follow more gaspy sobs and theres no way i sleep there with like that the manager said not till monday and i dont anyone else but
then so i remembered i had
but it went straight to
she reaches in her pocket pulls out a card
its jacks that he gave her in the club
it has his address on it
i have no idea what you just said but come on in here and well get it sorted out
she looks at him
wiping her tears
he picks up the heaviest of her bags and leads her to tiny one bedroom
curtains that match the area rug
have a seat
ill get us both a drink
here he hands her his phone
she looks at it
call whoever you want long distance whatever i cant
sure you can
her chin starts quivering all over again
what do you mean
she shakes her head siblings
no one okay
do i have to spell it out for you
i am completely alone
jack susses out the situation
youre not here to use my phone
she starts to cry again
no stop stop stop its okay its fine
youll crash here
just please no more crying
he grabs a bottle of tequila and a couple of glasses
pours them a couple
they both take a drink
she wipes her eyes
just for one night i swear
just till its light outside and i can figure out my next move
then she opens her small bag and the cat strolls out
whoa whoa you didnt say anything about a cat
you dont like cats
it slinks around his leg
he shakes it off
i hate cats
how can you hate a cat
its easy ill show you
the cat bolts into the bedroom
wheres it going
if that thing pees on my bed he goes outside
we just have to open a window
hes very independent
she opens the window
the cat scurries back in leaps onto the ledge
ali pets him
looks at jack smiles
i dont have a name for him yet
jack eyes it warily
in the living room the lights are low
alis on the couch under covers cat at her feet
intercut with the bedroom
jack at his keyboard playing from sheet music learning a song
when he pauses from the living room youre good
why dont you play at the club
make more money bartending

guitarist moved to reno drummer went to med school bassist is in rehab
im subbing around town till i regroup
this is for a punk fusion band their keyboardist is a flake so they call me a lot
a flaky punk rock fusion keyboardist
high angle seeing both of them on either side of a wall
her listening him playing
after a few measures hey
he stops playing again
whyd you leave kentucky
whyd you leave iowa
cause i looked around and realized there wasnt one person whose life i wanted
then as he starts playing again hey jack
he stops again
im really glad im not alone tonight
get some sleep
he continues playing
she closes her eyes
light rain on the window
close on the cats face staring right into camera
reverse on jack waking up
as his eyes open the cat licks him on the mouth
he hurls the cat away and bolts out of bed disgusted
jack straggles in wiping his mouth
the sofas made up blankets folded
ali is making breakfast her back to him
he cant help but notice shes only wearing a tiny tank top and undies
she hears him clear his throat
like my soul
she pours him a cup
sees a picture of a beautiful girl on his fridge
of course im straight
you thought i was gay
i dont know the
its a look
a straight look
and the floral couch
as ali realizes shes barely dressed in front of a straight guy
i should put on pants
she bolts out to the living room starts digging through her bag bent over
shes in the doorway so from the kitchen all he can see is her cute little ass sticking out
where is she
doing a play
for how long
six more weeks
she cant find pants
she shifts so now her ass is facing him directly
he tries not to look oh god now i feel bad about this
i dont know
now that youre straight and engaged it feels weird that i came here
well you did and it was fine
she pulls them out starts putting them on
he looks out
her foot is caught in the pants leg
as she hops around trying to untangle it or at least it will be as soon as you get dressed
she tumbles out of view thumps against some furniture
she appears in the doorway pants on pulling on a sweater
she slips her feet into her shoes
alrighty then ill get outta your hair now
wait wherere you headed
oh dont worry about me
ive got a plan
scoops up the cat come on cat
she zips the cat into the bag he came in
hang on let me at least spot you some cash
im a little strapped but i could no im good if you could just she nods at the door
he opens it for her
you are my knight in shining
out the door ill see you at the club
he closes the door behind her
ali looks at the rain
then marches out into it lugging her stuff
goes about yards in one direction then stops
jack watches her out the window as she marches yards in another direction then stops
she sees a bus stop across the street
she crosses to it and sits
ali peers down the street for the bus
jack appears beside her getting soaked in the rain
so this plan of yours
was to sit here at the bus stop and come up with a plan
come back inside
no jack i ill figure it out this is not its pouring
its only water for chrissakes
jack youve done enough and in one move he scoops her up as she lets out a whoooop
he grabs her bags and carries her back across the street the door kicks open they enter jack carrying ali dripping wet
he sets her down look you have nowhere to go i have a couch
you may as well stay here for a few days
you really dont need to do that
ill be fine youll be homeless
you always have this much trouble saying yes when someone is trying to help you
its never happened before
the cat jumps up on the back of a chair all wet and shakes splattering them with wet cat smell
as his phone rings
theres a towel in the bathroom dry yourself and that damn cat off
ali collects the cat heads for the bathroom
jack checks his phone
hey baby hows it going
just this person from work what
no shes just a friend im helping her out
nat its nothing
music up baby youve got what it takes by brook denton and dinah washington over
close on a heavily made up girl as she screams and drops out of the shot in a flying split
behind her a row of dancers do the same
typical fantastic old school can can
widen to see tess and sean on the floor auditioning them
the club is brightly lit none of its evening aura
scattered around the club are other hopefuls in groups waiting for their turn
jacks motorcycle pulls up to the club with jack driving and ali riding on back
ali and jack enter as the auditions are under way
as they set up the bar ali watches the stage intrigued
montage the dancers auditioning in small groups
all shapes sizes
finally only a few are left
okay front row thank you very much
they walk off stage dismissed
tess turns to sean
what happened to all the great dancers in l
theyre busy dancing with the stars
to the waiting dancers last group please
half a dozen dancers move to the stage
ali watches from behind the bar thinking
then on her face we see an idea forming
on the floor tess and sean check their clipboards organizing for this next set
they look up and start in all right ladies and five six seven whoa
there in the back row is ali in her white platform shoes
what the hell do you think youre doing
coco and georgia enter surprised to see ali on stage
i dont think so
tess ive been singing and dancing my whole life and the girls here have years of training and experience
this stage is for serious and professional
angry interrupting hey
this is your club and you can be as rude as you want but dont you dare tell me im not serious
seans eyebrows reach for the ceiling as nikki enters sees ali on stage
i may not have been to a professional dance school but i have a lot of talent and i came to this town to do something with it
and the only reason ive been putting up with all the bullshit attitude i get from you is cause i want to do it here
for the first time in my life i dont want to be someplace else
so youre gonna give me my shot
everyone in the club just stands there
tess just looks at her blinks incredulous
you dont like it ill quit and do us both a favor
your call lady
i know every number in the show
sean eyes big as saucers looks from ali to tess then back you know every number
which one do you wanna see
tess looks at her in disbelief
i said which one do you wanna see
ali just stares at her
calling her bluff tess yells up to dave in the sound booth
tess plops down in a booth crosses her arms indignantly
on stage the music starts
ali readies herself starts to dance
behind a beat to two
shes got the steps right but it isnt clicking
shes thinking too hard
after a few measures tess has seen enough
okay then next
to dave in the booth start it again please
as dave resets the music
ali regroups takes her hair down and shakes it loose
nikki enters sees ali on stage what the hells going on
on stage ali takes a beat inhales breathing in attitude
then she looks up at the booth again
the music starts in again
and this time ali comes alive
she may not have perfect technique or the best extension but she exudes an ambition and sexuality no one has seen from her before
its like she becomes a woman before our eyes
she misses a step or two but who the hell cares
on the floor sean gapes eyes popping
tess is poker faced
coco and georgias expressions turn from dubious to respectful
nikkis eyes narrow
at the bar jack freezes a huge rack of glasses in his arms unable to tear his eyes away
as the song climaxes ali finishes with an alluring toss of her ass then lands in a sexy layout on a chair owning the stage
the music ends
a stunned silence
the only sound is alis heavy breathing
then georgia jumps up applauding effusively
what are so you happy about thats your replacement
yeah but shes really good
tess and ali are in a stare down
i want so badly to say something bitchy but nothings coming
theres a first
tess sighs not wanting to give ali any props
you were off the whole second half
so i was spot on the first half
tess narrows her eyes at ali
then looks over at nikki coco and georgia
georgia gives an effusive thumbs up then suddenly becomes overcome by nausea covers her mouth and runs to the bathroom to puke tess rolls her eyes looks back at ali
oh youre gonna be such a pain in my ass
ali tries hard not to beam do i have the job or not
youre not great
what you are is lucky
because i need someone tonight
and i know all the routines
as tess turns and leaves even in those shoes that time forgot
nikki watches tess go turns and pours herself a shot
well this totally sucks ass
sean jumps up on the stage
the last time someone showed tess balls like that she married him
looks ali over you look like a checker at a mal wart in wichita
just tripled your salary
get a new look
hey i happen to like the way i look
thats a fascinating story
and then what happens
backstage in five
welcome to the family
ali jumps off the stage runs to the bar where jack is still standing slack jawed
she throws her arms around him
sorry for the short notice i quit
plants a big kiss on him but hey with my raise ill be off your couch in a week
she squeezes him tight then heads backstage leaving him standing there really turned on
sean swings open a door revealing a room packed to the gills with costumes feathers sequins fishnets corsets jammed up against each other
sean tosses her clothes in a blur
first number second number third number
she catches the clothes
he dumps shoes on top of them holding them up as he tells her what they go with with the sequined bustier
with the shorts and garters
with the beaded number
and those points to hers i never want to see again
and he hands her a prop gold machine gun
for miss otis regrets
just be sure you dont ali pulls the trigger
boom glitter splats all over sean
pull the trigger
the chic audience watches the girls doing a swingin sixties shimmy and shake number
camera moves across the girls faces as drums roll and their heads turn to each drumbeat
the last face to turn is alis
in full stage make up she looks like a gorgeous classic burlesque dancer
the girls in s revealing bathing suits and stilettos kick and dance downstage in a line
ali struggles a little to keep up a waiter crosses frame and we wipe to another night
same music different costumes
alis dancing is improving
waitress crosses frame and we wipe to
same music yet another set of costumes
alis as good as anyone else up there
an audience member crosses frame and we wipe to another night
same music another set of costumes
ali knows the steps now shes not thinking about them
shes all performance vamping to the audience selling like crazy
she nails a final layout on a chair its flawless
tess and sean are watching from the wings
they notice the extra whip in alis head the bump in her grind
you like her
it kills you but you like her
tess meets his eye then walks away
the number ends
the girls rush offstage and peel their costumes off
my tits are up around my ears my thongs about a mile up up ass this corset is so tight i havent breathed since tuesday and these lashes are thick
enough to kick up a stiff wind
its fun being a girl huh
she hands him the last bits of her costume
follow ali as she heads to the dressing room
as she grabs her t shirt and jeans im starving who wants to go grab some pizza before the next show
a general chorus of yeah
and im in
follow ali to the bathroom as she throws on her clothes and washes off her make up humming rich mans frug to herself
she heads back out to the dressing room to find everyone is gone
she looks around
feels like an fool
she plunks down in a chair
drops her bag on the floor
looks at herself in the mirror
she sees a picture of a classic burlesque beauty taped to the mirror
notices her eye make up strong thick eyeliner
ali picks up a brush dips it in eyeliner and tries to duplicate the look on her own eye
after a first try your brush is for shit
she turns and sees tess in the doorway
tess comes over takes alis brush
looks at it
whered you get this the cent store
she chucks it in the trash
make up is like wine
the good stuff costs a fortune but is worth every penny
where is everyone
all the girls went out for pizza
arent you one of the girls
tess reads her like a book
knows what went down
she turns to leave then pauses at the door
dont take it personally
their loves the kind you gotta earn
ali meets her eyes in the mirror
then tess grabs a brush from her own station tosses it to ali
dip it in water first or youll never get a clean line
she leaves ali alone
jack enters in boxers kicks them off opens the shower then freezes
ali is just waking up
your stupid cat peed in the tub
sees the window closed you closed the window what do you expect
your cat pees in the house and its my fault
ali scoops the cat up
poor guy you must have been desperate
and you used my towel again
then pointed hows that apartment hunting coming
he grabs the newspaper and tosses it in front of her she glares at him then glances at the paper a thousand bucks for a studio
can you really put a price on privacy
your own bathroom
with clean towels
okay jack i get it his cell phone rings
as he checks whos calling natalie
then into phone hey baby how are you
he heads into the bedroom closes the door
ali shakes her head begins to peruse the classifieds
ali in pajamas is at the table combing the classified apartment ads
the cat is beside her
guest studio hollywood with a yard and oh
to the cat screw them
she scans the ads some more
finds a good one
jack walks in
looks like hes got something on his mind
i think i found my new place
go to hell turn left its three miles down on the right
hows beachwood canyon
great if you have a car
truth is you should get a car first
this is l
you dont exist without a car
plus you cant really afford a decent place yet
tell you what
im gonna suck it up and let you stay here a little longer
just throw in a little something for rent
she looks at him curious
what about the god damn cat
hey i dont like the cat
and i dont like my towel being wet
i dont like the lack of privacy
but youre in a jam and im the kind of guy if a friends in trouble i help
its just who i am
what did natalie have to say
nothing you know just
she narrows her eyes at him
her play got extended three more months so since she has to pay rent there she cant also keep up her part of the rent here
so if you could stick around and chip in it would save your ass
ali looks down at his shoes
well will you look at that
the shoe on the other foot
one minute im a freeloader with a god damn cat the next im the only thing standing between you and just yes or no
whats the proposal exactly
jack looks at her realizes hes screwed
the bedroom with private bathroom access for a month including utilities
ali picks up the paper reads an ad
the closet too
she weighs it
makes him suffer
hey im the kind of girl if a friends in trouble i help
thats just who i am
we hear an audience laugh o
small crowd outside
so i said to the sailor i may not be as good as i once was
through a transparent scrim the puccini triplets perform a sexy harem scene in silhouette casting larger than life shadows tess walks behind the scrim playfully in and out of view
the bumber band plays off to the side
but you can bet your sweet ass im better once than i ever was
the crowd laughs
tess points to a woman who isnt laughing
drink up sister
youre a tad behind
to a waiter re woman be a dear and bring mommy over there another scotch
the crowd chuckles as the bumper band kicks in and the harem scene evolves into a sexy tongue in cheek silhouetted dance
tess comes off stage
sean bustles up to her
the distributors holding back the booze unless we cut him a check
ply him with drinks send scarlett over to flirt and try to finagle him down to a half
hows a third
he produces a check all filled out for her to sign
have i told you lately that i love you
got any brothers
he bustles off with the check
scarlett coco and nikki approach the stage wearing leather strappy gaultier corsets with gloves and fishnets post modern germanesque nikki is carrying a glass of tequila
tess eyeballs her drinking already
but im working on it
nikki totters a little
tess looks her over
im pulling you from this number

you cant pull me tess spots ali heading for the dressing room ali
take nikkis spot
that bitch cant dance my part
ali get dressed now
ali looks at nikki who glares at her but wait tess thats always been nikkis number
tess looks at her shes really had it with these girls but this is my club and now its your number
ali looks between the two of them nikki glaring at her
is there a problem
you said you know the whole show
you can do anything right
tess just looks at ali
nikki stares at tess livid then storms off
marcus enters the club and joins vince at a table
a loud ali and the other dancers hit the stage and start in on the vampy tough lover
at the bar jack is busy mixing drinks
he glances at the stage then double takes on ali looking crazy gorgeous
she vamps forward with the girls they rotate singing into the prop mic
dave the sound guy looks up as nikki comes in
tess needs you
she said it was urgent
i cant leave here now fine but dont say i didnt warn you
shit okay he checks his sound board then bolts from the room
nikki watches him go looks down onto the stage as ali steps to nikki reaches out and flips a switch
the sound drops out
the playback stops
the girls freeze in awkward poses unsure of what to do
murmurs in the room as the audience looks around confused
backstage tess looks up at the sound booth sees its empty
dave appears at her side
you wanted to see me
on stage ali looks at flustered tess
on the floor nikki watches with satisfaction as she makes her way over to marcus
enjoying the train wreck she caused
then in a flash ali turns to the audience and sings acapella from the top of the song
she looks around
tess approaches in to a stage hand close the goddman curtain
ali starts to sing again her version slow and sexy
tess looks at ali you could knock her over with a feather
sean looks at tess
scarlett looks at coco
jack stares at the stage
everyone stunned by the sound coming out of this girl
and now the song really takes off
suddenly one of the band boys grabs his sax and plays
ali jumps in seamless as the guys on bass and drums join in
ali picks up the choreography
the girls fall in with her
coco and scarlett chime in on back up
hearing them jessie and anna join in as well
ali takes off holding nothing back
the girls feed off her confidence and soon all of them are hitting the backs of their cabaret chairs stomping their feet to the music
the girls singing back up
in his seat marcus sits up a little straighter suddenly paying more attention
unable to take his eyes off ali
the band plays along
the bartenders accompany them with hand claps
all except jack whos too spellbound to move
on the floor nikki watches aghast as the crowd engages like weve never seen them
the girls come alive finally able to sing a song theyve been faking for so long
the room erupts in applause knowing they caught a once in a lifetime performance
marcus stands clapping whistling
ali basks in it jubilant rapturous
she glances to the wings and sees sean clapping and jumping in place
then she sees tess beside him stone faced
the girls exit the stage in a flurry everyone congratulating ali a whirlwind of hugs kisses
ali reaches tess
tess when the music stopped why didnt you tell me you i have no idea what happened
could blow like that
tess spots a tattooed band guy in the door
do you boys know all the music
nikki wanders in drink in hand
tess looks at them all
plants her hands on her hips
tomorrow night ali sings lead everyone else is back up
ali cant keep from beaming as she shakes her head no
the girls file into the dressing room
tess heads out past nikki
people dont come to hear us sing
but theyll come to hear her sing
dry out and maybe you can back her up
sean grabs ali
bitch you sang that damn song
he heads off to the dressing room too leaving nikki and ali alone together
their eyes meet
one of us has clearly underestimated the other
she tosses her glass in the trash and leaves ali alone
ali trots out from backstage spots jack behind the bar
she heads over to him
before she gets there whered you learn to sing like that
marcus is there
handsome charming and devious as ever
you cant learn to sing like that
well youre too good to be singing here
i just got into the show and suddenly im too good for it
shrugs but you are then how about a drink
jacks at the bar
tell him i sent you
its on me
but i hate lines
at the bar jack looks up sees ali and marcus talking
back on marcus who looks ali up and down
you sound even better than you look
which is saying a lot
talk about a line
she smiles amused and heads away from him toward the bar
he watches her go
tess intercepts ali
what did he want
directions to the bar
as ali heads off
tess glances back at marcus mistrustful
the club is closed
jack ali coco sean and georgia are sitting around the bar as jack closes up
you blew me away
who knew you could sing like that
who knew any white chick could sing like that
you channeled that shit
how the hell do you do that girl
i dont know i cant explain it
its like i start singing and something starts to move inside me
its in my hands my feet my gut she runs her hands over her body as she describes it
jack watches her holy smokes
sean notices his gaze on her
and it just builds and builds till i feel like im gonna explode
trust me i know what that feels like
i have to pee
she hops off the stool and scurries to the back
coco stands to leave
looks at ali
wanna grab something to eat
ali looks back at coco validated
lemme get my bag
ali moves off
coco goes to get her coat
sean sees jack still watching ali as she walks across the room
well will you look at that
you looking at that girl the way i looked at you all those years
only difference you actually stand a chance with her
i have a fiancee
three thousand miles away
we talk every day
let me guess what about her her and
jack shoots him a glare
all im saying is this ones beautiful on the inside too
and she wont be on the shelf forever
ali comes back ready to go
feels them stop talking and look at her
i was just explaining to jack that even opportunity has a shelf life
jack grabs a trash bag and takes it out back
sean looks at ali more closely
he brushes her hair out of her face
then he holds it off her shoulders and raises that gay eyebrow
salon day ali sits in front of a mirror while sean gives the hairdresser very specific instructions
jacks apartment at his keyboard jack plays a high energy style piano which runs over a quick sequence its the instrumental music to but im a good girl
burlesque lounge the burlesque girls dance on stage performing a high energy tap dance coupled with a european slap dance with the slapping of each others bodies and faces integrated
with tapping and music
its very cabaret but modernized with contemporary stepping
carry music int
salon later the hairdresser spins the chair around
alis her hair is platinum blonde with bangs and a louise brooks bob that frames her face beautifully
her smoky eyes pop like never before
ali studies herself where have i been all my life
audience the brass section kicks in giving the piano a bigger bawdy show stopping boisterous sound as ali appears with her new look
like helmut newton meets carnaby st
as she begins this high energy song jack is looks up from the bar
totally blown away
ali finishes the song to big applause
takes her bow
makes her way off the stage and across the club to
jack at the bar he turns to see ali
hiya big boy
she spins herself around on a bar stool so he can see all angles
jack likes plenty
way too much
what do you think
i think you look
i mean yeah
do you like it
not the reaction she was looking for
its okay for you to think i look hot
were friends for chrissakes
its not like were brother and sister
she rolls her eyes gets up and heads backstage
jack watches her go no
we certainly are not
the burlesque girls are prepping for the show
why the hell is everyone having a conniption over her
shes just a tacky pushy girl from a ali sexy sophisticated gorgeous enters
fly over state
ali pretends she didnt hear
she sits at her mirror
the girls stare at her mouths agape
ali picks up her mascara wand looks down the mirror at nikkis reflection
whats a fly over state
ali takes a deft stroke of her wand over her lashes then bats them at nikki
nikki walks out
coco smiles with appreciation
whistles long and low
the girls all laugh
tess glad hands guests then spots vince waving at her
she starts over then sees marcus in the booth with vince
she turns and walks the other way
vince catches up to her
vince if i were going to sell id have sold to those idiots building that monstrosity across the street
i said no
which made marcus bump his offer up again
its obscene what he wants to give us
at least hear him out
tess at her desk reads a contract
marcus and vince sit across from her watching
its very simple
i buy you out and pay you a million off the top
motions to vince five hundred grand each
tess looks up from the contract squints at marcus
why do you want this club so badly
best view on the sunset strip
do you know what you could do with that money tess
do you know what you can do with that money vince
were rolling vendors ninety days out
the clubs not even worth what you paid for it
youve got a second mortgage you cant get a third
tess looks at vince betrayed
did you also tell him about the tattoo on my ass
its business tess
which i built from the ground up
youre not gonna get another opportunity like this
she looks at a photo on her wall the burlesque girls in all their glory
which is why ill never let it go
she gets up opens the door ushering them out
marcus shoots vince an angry look as they head downstairs
in the stairwell vince reassures marcus dont worry
the balloon payments due on the first
she doesnt have the money
she has to sell
in tesss office tess stands in the doorway having heard
then she walks back to her desk and sits dejected
head in her hands
for the first time ever looking worried and defeated
something shed never show anyone
weve had a pretty good run
she looks up
sean is in the doorway
maybe its time to just
hang it up
let it go
call it a day
tesss eyes go steely with determination
you cannot say that to me
i can eat these sky is falling dipshits for breakfast lunch and dinner but not you
you cannot be that person
ive scoured dirty flea markets for costumes stayed up all night sewing till my fingers bled painted and repainted every goddamn wall of this place myself
i choreographed every step of every number
ive played nursemaid sister mother and shrink to every girl whos ever danced here
ive hocked every keepsake ive ever owned to keep this place afloat
because this club is the last of its kind and if it goes away one day there wont be anything like it and that would be a tragedy
so you cannot say that to me
because now someones gotta believe in me goddamnit
and i need that person to be you
so dont you ever let me hear you say that again
i will never let this club go
sean looks at her
a wry smile
there she is
thought id lost you for a minute
tess just looks at him and smiles
he grabs a boa throws it around his neck and exits
when hes gone tesss smile fades
in the club the place is empty
jack is wiping down the bar cleaning up
he starts stacking some chairs in the house as
sean crosses the floor
sean exits as jack carries a stack of chairs to the side of the room sets them down near the piano
stops grabs a chair for himself and sits down
begins to play an original song
across the room ali enters from backstage
her dance bag over her shoulder
she hears the piano peers around a column sees jack playing
she stays in the shadows and watches as he sings and plays a beautiful song
tbd the song ends
ali applauds slowly
jack looks up surprised that she is there
you write that
just some sentimental crap
she smiles at his modesty
he crosses to her
grabs her dance bag and they exit together
jack enters unloading his keyboard from his back
he hears ali in the bedroom
he quietly moves over to the ajar bedroom door peeks in and sees ali in bra and undies
she hums the song he played the night before in the mirror as she gets dressed
on jack watching mesmerized
his eyes travel her body
she moves out of view
he leans against the wall to try to keep seeing her and steps on the cat
he flattens against the wall
ali looks up
jack zips back to the door opens it quietly then slams it
just got home
ali grabs a dress from her bed slips into it
can you zip me up
in a nanosecond jack enters the bedroom
where you been
im playing a late show tonight
as he zips up the back of her dress he sees the photo propped against the lamp on the bedside table
who is that
she picks up the picture
looks at it
me and my mom on my th birthday
she died just a few weeks later
she was so young
there was so much she never got to do
sometimes i feel like if i make the most of my life part of her will get to live a little more too
you must miss her
she puts the photo down
turns back to him
every single day something happens i want to tell her about
what was todays
their eyes connect
hasnt happened yet
they stand there close to each other
jack sees a strand of hair caught in the earring
he pulls it away freeing it
his fingers move through her hair
she closes her eyes feeling his fingers against her neck
then she opens her eyes looks at him
he looks back unable to look away
until his cell phone rings
breaking the mood
he pulls it from his pocket
checks whos calling
looks back at ali
ali steps away from him disappointed
he answers the phone
hey babe how are you
ali watches him walk away from her falling into the conversation with natalie
yes shes still here what do you want me to do its not like youre here helping out you know
ali grabs her bag and jacket heads for the door
music up an incredibly sexy saxophone which takes us to full close up ali steps into frame starts singing
pull back to reveal shes on stage at the club with the burlesque girls
finger waves and s sexy clothes
jacks living room ali lies on her stomach on the floor perusing a fashion magazine
across the room jack sits on the couch playing his keyboard underscoring the song
he looks at ali
without looking up she takes a pencil gathers her hair and puts it up expertly
a few strands fall back onto her neck
ali feels his stare
looks up at him
he smiles back
she goes back to her magazine
loving that shes there
burlesque lounge dressing room ali the girls and sean getting ready
georgia bursts into the room showing off an engagement ring
everyone jumps up congratulates her
burlesque stage the girls and ali vamp singing at the bar jack watches as he pours drinks
afternoon ali on the back of jacks motorcycle puts her arms around his waist
jack revs the engine
weaving through traffic on the strip
the wind in their hair
her scarf tears away lifting into the air
burlesque stage ali and burlesque girls continue
jacks living room ali sean tess scarlett anna georgia damon her fiance hanging out in the living room decorated with party gear
the lights dim and jack and coco enter with a birthday cake
they set it in front of ali
ali looks around at her friends drinking it in
she locks eyes with jack then closes her eyes and blows
burlesque stage ali still singing her song
pull back to reveal a packed house
the audience goes nuts
marcus is at his table clapping whistling her biggest fan
ali walks up to the bar
hey when can you cut out

in fact i gotta head out or im gonna be late
checking his watch i can maybe swing you home before
no thats okay you go

he grabs his jacket from under the bar
as he heads out by the way you killed
looks at him smiles thanks
he disappears out the back exit
ali turns around and finds herself face to face with marcus
ill drop you off
coco left five minutes ago
she realizes he was listening to her conversation
sorry i was coming to talk to you and caught the end of your conversation
putting on her coat reaching for her bags talk to me about
he swoops down and grabs her dance bag and purse turns and heads out
if you ever expect to see this bag alive again
youll come with me

on ali looking out the window with her arms crossed
widen to reveal shes in car with marcus zipping along sunset

then youve been kidnapped
he turns off sunset and heads up into the hills
sprawling s modern
walls of glass
valets running around out front
fabulous party underway
packed with glitterati
music blares caterers weave through the hip crowd
marcus leads ali in and guides her through the crowd
hey marcus hey how you doing
he shakes the guys hand and moves on through the party
someone else calls out to him
hey let me get a drink ill be marcus pulls ali in the opposite direction avoiding another group trying to greet him
he grabs two wine glasses off a tray gives one to ali then pushes through a door into bustling food and booze everywhere
marcus spots several trays of hors doeuvres
he picks up two of them
marcus you cant just take that
he hands her one tray sticks a bottle of wine in one pocket throws an opener in another
theyre gonna throw us out of here
not if we sneak out first come on
he kicks open a back door
a sky full of stars hovering over an expansive back yard
music from the party drifts out
marcus looks around up
he starts up some steps to an outdoor gazebo
they pass an incredibly well dressed couple coming down
hey marcus hey guys
greg marla this is ali
they exchange hellos
ali notices ooh
great party as always
glad you could come
ali stares at marcus
he smiles takes her hand keeps leading her up the stairs
you had to make an appearance at your own party
wouldve been rude not to right
youd like those guys
gregs the entertainment editor at the times and marlas a designer
ali glances back at marla again locks in on her shoes
im gonna dream about those shoes
thousand dollars a pop
who can afford that
hey i saw them first
he laughs as they reach the top of the stairs and a breathtaking panoramic view of the entire city is revealed
ali pauses taking in the glittering massive view of l
looks one hell of a lot prettier from up here
that view cost me three times what the house did
see that strip mall down there
you own that too
i own everything above it
there is nothing above it
the guy who owns the strip mall was having money issues and almost had to sell
whoever he sold to would have put in a huge tower
so i bought the air rights
now no one can ever build above one story
arent you the sly puss
mall guy gets to keep his property
i get to keep the second best view in l
whats the first
he gazes at her
she rolls her eyes
how many girls have you used that on
none who ever called me on it
looks at her
what do you want ali
girl like you gives up everything gets on a bus heading for total uncertainty shes got a dream
i want to know what it is
because youre talented enough to get whatever you want
and im smart enough to help make it happen
what do you want
she thinks about it
looks him in the eye
i want to be the best singer i can be
i want to give as much joy as i get when i perform
and i want to die knowing i made the most of every opportunity life gave me
there wasnt a dry eye in the house when i said it at the grundy county junior miss talent show
his eyes narrow
why do you women always take advantage of nice boys
you are so not a nice boy
he clinks her glass
smiles at her
devilish and sexy
ali walks through the almost empty house passes a couple making out on a couch a guy who holds out a joint
she motions no thanks heads into the living room where marcus is asleep on a bertolli chair drink in hand
an older guy is playing the piano quietly
ali takes the drink from marcuss hand sets it on the table
she hears the pianist start a new song tbd
goes over to him
ooh i love this song
the piano player scoots to make room
she sits beside him
he starts humming along
she does too
then he sings a line
she sings one back
and they fall in together
not vamping not performing
just feeling the beauty of the music in the middle of the night
jack quietly lets himself in
he sets his keyboard down then sees the bedroom door cracked the light on
he looks in
he checks the clock
he hears a meow and sees the cat
he picks it up turns out the light and leaves the room
sean coco nikki jesse and the rest of the girls in early stages of getting ready
someone has a package
ali sees a gift box at her station
she reads the card you saw them first
she opens the box and sees the louboutins
nikki picks one up checking their authenticity
whos the sucker
all eyes turn to ali
shes saved by tess entering
coco puff shake a leg youre on in five georgie girl ali cat move move move tess exits
my nanna used to call me her ali cat
yet another fascinating story
why doesnt tess have a nickname for me
oh she does
a knowing look amongst the girls
she never uses it
sure she does
just after you leave the room
nikki gives him the finger and walks out
then coke whore
they crack up
cue music strange things happening
ali and the burlesque girls vamp forward and perform strange things happening a decadent rockin dance singing number
scantily clad girls pose and dance on chairs with images projected onto them a rock fantasy with burlesque moves like bob fosses all that jazz int
jacks apartment jack playing his keyboards
ali comes in wearing the louboutins
you were out late last night
i got a ride home with that guy marcus we went to a party
it was fun
marcus the asshole
turns out hes not so bad
she heads past him toward the kitchen
he notices new shoes
marcus in the audience watching her
marcus watching from his table
with him is greg from the party
jack watches from the bar
all the bartenders sing except jack who keeps his eyes on marcus
ali getting dressed to go out
shes wearing the louboutins crossing back and forth in front of jack whos on the sofa
theres only one reason a man buys a woman shoes you know
so what if im getting a little male attention
you get a lot more than a little
not from anyone who matters
i just think that you should be careful
ali stops in front of him
hands on her hips
and i just think that if you really feel the need to tell a girl what she should and shouldnt do you should pick up the phone and call your
ali continues to sing
at their table greg leans into marcus and whispers something impressed
marcus nods back told you
marcus drives ali up the windy roads into the hills
theyre talking animatedly
jack staring at a note jack going out see you tomw
a ali moves in sync with the girls
tess watches from the wings pleased
marcus leads ali through a party introducing her to everyone making sure she knows people and is known by them
nikki watches from the wings seething as marcus delights in alis performance
ali comes in shuts the door as quietly as she can then tiptoes past jack asleep on the couch
after she passes
jacks eyes open
ali owning the stage and the room
the song ends in a flourish
theres a camera flash
freeze frame on the image ali belting onstage with the burlesque girls striking a pose behind her
widen to see its a photo on the front page of the l
times calendar section
the headline burlesque has a voice
jack sleepy in boxers stares at the newspaper bewildered
have you seen this
ali wanders out of the bathroom brushing her teeth
he shows her the paper
the burlesque girls minus ali crowd around the paper
pointing to photo look again
the only thing major is the size of your ass
nikki walks off scarlett pick up the paper looks closer ali enters dance bag over her shoulder running late
the burlesque girls and sean all applaud except nikki ali smiles
she curtsies sarcastically
coco points to a bouquet of roses at alis station
from monsieur louboutin i presume
ali reads the card to the best view in l
sean shoves her down in her seat pulls her coat off
shake your tail alicat you still got a show to do
a packed line of chattering hipsters snakes down the block
daredevils missy and kitten deville in striped stockings corsets and tons of cleavage swing on a trapeze over the audience
playing the comedy grabbing each other in all the right places
classic burlesque unusually bawdy
equally suggestive funny and skillful
tess all dolled up weaves through the tables greeting welcoming reveling in the crowd
find ali as she strides over to marcuss booth
he stands hands her a glass of champagne
to the girl of the hour
im starting to think youll go to any length
i just made a call to greg at the times
well i appreciate the kudos
re crowded room and tess appreciates the business
this has nothing to do with tess
this is about you
you are so full of it
he laughs takes her arm ive got another friend i want you to meet
she sees harold saint sitting in the booth
hes in his s still dressing like robert evans in his heyday
ali rose harold saint
you worked with etta james
her she chewed me up and spat me out that one
but with her voice i forgive her everything
you got a set of pipes on you too little girl
i like your sound
i like yours
you ever recorded
we should do something about that
turns to marcus
see you round kiddo
he points his finger gun style which would seem cheesy but hes old school so instead its weirdly cool
at the bar jack watches ali and marcus talking excitedly
not liking what he sees
sean breezes by grabs a drink
you snooze you lose pretty boy
sean grips the drink in his teeth as he bustles through the backstage gathering costumes
he passes tess going the other way
can you believe this crowd
he dumps the costumes in her arms
these poor babies are begging for your glue gun
tess walks off with the armful of clothes so happy humming to herself passes her office opens the door to see vince is sitting at her desk
he flinches at the sight of her can you believe the crowd out there
never thought id see she stops in her tracks spotting vinces pants on the floor and a trail of womens clothes to
the new cocktail waitress peering out half dressed from behind the curtains
in my god damn office
she shakes her head grabs her purse and walks out
tess pissed off carries the damaged costumes out to her car
nikki is behind her following her out
we need to talk
tess rolls her eyes doesnt slow
not now nikki
ive been here since the beginning
we built this club together
and then some girl shows up out of nowhere who hasnt even paid her dues ill get her to write a check tomorrow
and suddenly its her show
no its not her show
its my show
but people want to hear her sing
shes bringing them in off the streets
you better believe im building a show around her
i can sing too
and you know it
but you dont give a shit
you always say this is a dance troupe now suddenly its not
and you expect me to dance behind a girl who struts in with a new pair of shoes she got for sleeping with marcus gerber
unlocking her car nikki youre wasted
i wont be upstaged by some slut with mutant lungs
tess hurls the costumes in the trunk of her car furious
so dont be
if you dont want to be a part of whats happening here then i dont want you around
youd destroy our friendship and break up the group over some girl you barely know
since when do you care about friendship
or this group
youre a trainwreck nikki
you put tequila on your breakfast cereal
im struggling to survive here and you show up too drunk to dance
you call that loyalty
nikki just looks at her okay then
nikki stomps off
tess sighs marcus says youre losing the club anyway
they dont come to hear us sing
nikki flips her off and keeps walking
then turns once more by the way i slept with vince the day after your honeymoon
tesss eyes narrow
she grabs a high heeled pump and hurls it
it flies through the air and hits nikki in the back of the head
nikki screams whips around incredulous to see tess running right at her
nikki bolts heading for her car
she jumps in locks the door just as tess smashes her fist on the window and kicks the door
nikki starts the car
you crazy bitch
nikki screeches off leaving tess alone in the parking lot
tess stands there a moment then heads back into the club
the club is totally empty
everyone is gone
tess enters grabs her bag as she spots a cabaret chair lying on its side on stage
she crosses onto the stage
picks up the chair as
tess looks up dave is closing up the sound booth
dave flips a big lever and almost all the lights go out leaving one shaft of light across the stage
we hear dave leave as the street door closes shut
tess alone on stage
ali enters quietly all dressed up
she slips off her heels and tiptoes to the bedroom
she slowly opens the bedroom door then stops when she sees
jack asleep in the bed
ali looks at him then looks at the couch
she closes the door fluffs the pillow lies down on the couch and pulls the blankets up over her
she lies in the darkness
push through the wall to see jack lying awake in the bed the cat on his lap
close on ali sleeping on the sofa abruptly wakes to the deafening grinding of coffee
she gets up drags herself to the kitchen
sees jack grinding the coffee way longer than is necessary
you really need to do that at in the morning
he turns sees her
little overdressed for breakfast
my pajamas were in my bedroom
which was occupied
well youre never here so
its stupid for me to crash on the couch every night when theres a perfectly good empty bed
jack grinds the coffee beans again
so you want the bedroom back
is that what youre saying
the bed should be used by someone
hey im home every night
maybe not when you think i should be but last i checked you were my roommate not my mother
however since its an issue what the hell take the bed ill sleep on the sofa
i dont care
youll have to move all your shit
i realize that
cause the rooms a total mess ill move my stuff god clothes make up shoes hair things
jesus jack what is your problem
ever since i started hanging out with marcus youve been acting like a class a prick
is there something you want to say
what do i care
youre ambitious he can make things happen go ahead make a deal with the devil whats it to me
first of all hes not the devil
hes a smart businessman
and oddly enough a gentleman
second im gonna take the couch and youre gonna the attitude
or im finding another place to live
she storms out of the kitchen tripping over the cat a loud meow
as the cat scurries away jack intercepting him and try not to kill the cat
a slam of the bedroom door
music up instrumental to baby its your by the shirelles
close on a diamond ring as its placed on the hand of a very pregnant georgia
wearing an adorable mini skirt maternity wedding dress
she looks at damon with devotion
ali tess coco sean and jack all watching the ceremony
ali looks over at jack
he looks at her then away
the reception is underway
guests are drinking dancing with the iconic backdrop of hollywood behind them
ali sean coco and tess stand together drinking overlooking the city
across the terrace jack is talking on his cell phone
what do you mean youre still in new york
so you just decided not to come
you think you mightve wanted to i dont know let me know
we havent seen each other in six months
across the terrace ali sees jack yelling into his phone
sean sees her watching
why does every conversation we have end up being about your future
jack looks across the terrace at ali
moonlight on her shoulders
a breeze in her hair
you know what youre right
we both should be thinking about our futures
and i might just be looking at mine right now
break a leg baby
jack hangs up with finality and marches toward the bar his cell phone immediately rings again
he sees its natalie sends it to voicemail and shuts off his phone
as he passes sean and coco i guess natalies not coming after all
oh please that girl
show up at a party where shes not the center of attention
at the bar later jack drains one drink and orders another getting very drunk
ali sidles up to the bar
shot of patron
jack raises his brow
ali drinks the shot and without looking at him lookin kinda lonely
but never lonely
cheers baby he raises his glass she rolls her eyes walks off he follows her playfully pushing her from behind
hey whatre we in junior high
you still mad at me iowa
bring it on
she starts to say something as the shirelles start to sing baby its you jack turns to the dj points both fingers at him and yells everyone stares at the
ali rolls her eyes and walks off jack swings her around pulling her close she just looks at him
starts to laugh at how drunk he is jack wraps her in his arms and starts to sing quietly in her ear
many many many nights go by i sit alone at home and cry over you
well youre quite the crooner
he looks her in the eye
im sorry for being a class a prick
ali smiles surprised at his candor
he breathes a sigh of relief
and as of about
bleary look at his watch some time ago i am officially a single man
you and natalie split up
that we did
that explains what im doing here all alone
what are you doing here all alone
do i look alone to you
they share a look
then he spins her around in his arms
at the bar tipsy sean and coco stand side by side
coco is watching the dj spin
the dj glances down at them
that djs hot
he keeps looking at me
coco smiles up at him flirty
the dj smiles back
i think hes cuckoo for coco puffs
they look at each other then crack up like giggling schoolgirls
close on a key trying to go into a lock
then it disappears from view
we hear it clank to the ground
whoopsie daisy pull back to find jack and ali drunk staring at the keys on the ground
my nanna used to say that all the time
that and upsie jumpsie
running it together upsie jumpsie whoopsie daisy upsie jumpsie whoopsie daisy upsie jumpsie when would she say that
when she wanted her dog to get on the bed with her
that is when she was alive
their eyes meet
then staring into her eyes trying to be serious the dog or nanna
ali bursts out laughing
so does jack as he pushes the door open and they fall into the apartment
jack and ali stumble in jack knocks the lamp over trying to turn on the light
ali giggles as she plops down on the couch struggling to take off her leather boot
she holds her legs out
jack gets the lamp to standing then grabs one of alis boots slides it off dumps it
then he tries the second it sticks he pulls harder the boot pops off and he careens backwards crashing into the lamp knocking it over again
ali cracks up
he turns to the lamp
like to a dog stay
he turns back to ali regains composure bows good night
he backs away into the bedroom
ali looks confused
jack disappears into the bedroom and closes the door
ali stares at it surprised
she undoes her bra threads it through her top and out the arms
then jacks door opens
he stands in the doorway in matching rudolph the red nosed reindeer pajamas leaning against the doorframe like hugh hefner in his finest silk smoking jacket
a gift from my mother
never worn them
jack walks past ali toward the door
forgot to lock up
he walks back into the bedroom and once gain shuts the door
ali smiles to herself plumps her pillow
the door flies open again jacks there in just the pants no top
he stumbles past ali to the kitchen drinks from the tap
after a moment he returns to the bedroom nodding to ali
ali just nods
he closes the door
ali smiles waiting
after a beat the door opens again
jack is there in boxers
he walks past her to the kitchen opens a box of cereal pours it into his mouth
grabs some milk from the fridge pours it into his mouth too
returns to the bedroom crunching
he closes the door
then very quickly he opens it again and walks out
i know i forgot something else but i just cant remember what
door locked water food
he wanders out into the room past ali and we see from behind he is butt ass naked
she cracks up
whats so funny
she covers her face
he glances down
well i never
he strides back to the bedroom shutting the door
after a moment he comes back out dressed in an old flowered bathrobe and fur lined orange hunting cap
i remembered what i forgot to do
kiss you goodnight
he crosses to her takes her in his arms and kisses her
she kisses back making up for all their lost time
music up prisoner a big soulful ballad
ali steps into frame on stage singing jack and ali in bed in post coital bliss
well its official
you are definitely not gay
he smiles at her drunk with lust
camera pans up and off of ali on stage lights blasting
ali and jack in bed in different positions wrapped in sheets
jack traces the outline of her lips with his finger
ive been wanting to do this since you first walked in the club
she cocks an eyebrow at him
sure got a funny way of showing it
he smiles at her
ill show you an even funnier way you ready
he disappears under the sheets
she squeals starts laughing hysterically
camera pans up and off of them then drifts ali on stage belting
jack in bed sitting against the headboard wearing only a hat
alis leg in the foreground a la the graduate as she pulls on one fishnet stocking
jack watches mesmerized
so what about natalie
rolls the stocking up over her shapely thigh then slowly takes it off
looks at jack
he strikes his chest struck by cupid do it again
she giggles repeats the sexy act for him
camera pans up and ali on stage the big finish jack and ali twisted up in the sheets their respective eyeliners smeared
alis platinum bob sticks up in all directions
half of a fake eyelash stuck on her cheek
close on the lock as a key is inserted
the door opens
a pair of womens heels enter the apartment and pick their way over last nights discarded clothes and head for where jack and ali are sleeping entwined
the heels stop at the base of the bed
then enraged jack bolts up in bed
ali blinks awake
jack scrambles for something to put on
you are a liar
youre a sneaky pathetic li ar
quiet to jack what s she doing here i dont know
i live here you bleached out tramp what the hell are you doing here

ali grabs some pants from the floor pulls them on

as ali quickly grabs a few things ali im really sorry i so am i
she gathers up more things really pissed wait do you need money for a motel or
ali stifles him with an incredulous glare cant believe how this is going down
she looks at him so incredibly hurt
grabs her suitcase and brushes past him stuffing her belongings into it
jack goes after her ali wait a second dont as the door slams go
jack looks at natalie
she folds her arms
ali knocks on a door suitcase in hand
then a good looking guy whos obviously just woken up answers with a blanket wrapped around him
he is the dj from the wedding
i think i have the wrong apartment
im looking for sean
off his blank look brown hair
i thought he said john
the dj shuffles inside
ali follows as he leads her to the bedroom
he points to sean in the bed
seans eyes pop open confused to see her
what are you doing here
sean notices the guy in the blanket
ali this is mike
anyone want coffee
ill make it
you two get acquainted
ali makes coffee looking out the window at hollywood
her phone rings
she answers right away thinking its jack
is the coffee ready
jurys still out
should i be jealous
only if you had your eye on sean
you sound down
maybe a little
i know just the cure
but you turned me down
she thinks for a moment
then havent you heard
no is the new yes
a curtain lifts revealing a black box five girls from behind seem to be floating in blackness their curves illuminated
they begin to move to the music think wabash blues crazy horse saloon the group turns toward us natalies heels storm away from the apartment
carrying her bags really pissed she kicks a big fat rose blossom off a bush and continues on
the girls continue the number
post modern gaultier bondage cages on top bowler hats and black shorts
a humongous moon hangs at the back of the theatre the black stage awash in golden light
marcus is waiting in his bentley
ali gets in
marcus looks at her
she forces a smile
the bentley rounds the corner as we hold and see jacks motorcycle thunder up
he gets off runs to the building
sean and mark exchange awkward good byes
mark turns heads down the stairs as jack rushes up calling is ali here
mark continues down
jack whips around looks at him then up at sean who nods
whered she go
i told you opportunity doesnt knock forever
jack burns frustrated then heads slowly down the stairs
sean shakes his head and turns to go back inside
then pauses noticing mark looking up at seans apartment hesitating
then he opens his car to get in
sean stands there realizing hes doing the same thing
he steps onto the stairwell
calls out hey
you wanna have breakfast
off marks smile ali follows marcus through the kitchen to the fridge
my mother always said theres only one thing to do when youre feeling blue
he opens the fridge and pulls out a bottle of champagne
she was a poet
and a drunk
marcus pops the cork fills two glasses hands her one
to your new place
what new place
a lavish square foot guest house
marcus ushers ali in
off her look unpack
marcus i cant just sure you can
marcus plops her suitcase on the bed
its not even on the bus route
okay that is the first and last time the term bus route will be spoken in this house
motions out window four cars
which do you want
ali lies on a chaise overlooking the panoramic view of l
against a fiery red sky
marcus comes out of the house with a bottle of wine
crosses and sits next to her on the chaise
marcus refills their wine glasses
an empty bottle already there
she sips as she leans back and relaxes
she looks out at a giant billboard at eye level
youre gonna be on one of those someday
sooner than you think too
harold saint called me today
you made quite an impression on him
whatd he say
he wants to make a demo with you
are you serious
he found a little studio time on tuesday
oh my god no thats amazing
i like making you happy
your whole face lights up
their eyes meet
he pushes some hair out of her face
i think youre way too nice to me
and thats a problem because
ive had a lot to drink
and my judgment is off
he touches her face their chemistry palpable
hey im a gentleman
which means id never kiss a lady when shes
she looks at him
she leans in and impulsively pulls him into a kiss
jack alone now collects the clothes ali left behind
he reaches under the couch and sees the photo of ali and her mother
he picks it up smooths out the cracks
traces year old alis face with his fingertips
ali lies in a tangle of thread count sheets
her eyes blink open
she sits up alone getting her bearings
where am i
she sees a warhol esque print of marcus on the wall
she raises her brows then sees her disheveled reflection in a huge mirror smeared mascara hair askew
who am i
she sees her and marcuss clothes in a trail on the floor and bites her lip remembering last night
ali freshly showered enters a stranger in a strange land
staff is milling around
she hears a splash
looks out the glass windows sees marcus swimming laps
the housekeeper passes her nods morning
then she notices a long table full of miniature models of buildings
she takes them in pausing at a tall sleek model of a glass high rise towering over the other models
she runs her finger lightly over it intrigued
then she sees the address marker sunset blvd
ali stares stunned
marcus enters toweling himself dry
he comes up behind her nuzzles her neck
what is this
now its a model
but when it grows up itll be a mixed use space retail and residential
this is the address of the burlesque lounge
marcus shrugs dries his hair
best view on the sunset strip with no windows
when im done with it itll have a thousand
you cant tear down the club
actually i can
but what about the history
that place is a landmark
not according to the city
does tess know about this
what tess knows and doesnt know isnt a big concern of mine
what makes you think she would ever sell the lounge
she has no choice
shes going under
but that club is her life
oh come on you get this
its not personal
its pretty god damn personal for tess
and coco and sean and alexis
and what about jesse
and dave the lighting guy
and what about me
its pretty god damn personal to me
she turns to leave
where are you going
to the club
where i work
she marches out of the room resolute ali wait
at the door she turns back and looks at him

ali catches the keys and takes off
parking lot night ali in a prius peels out of the lot weaving through traffic as she lifts her cell
airport night close shot a cell phone in a plastic bowl moves through a security x ray machine

find jack on the other side as his belongings come down the conveyor belt
he grabs them turns off his cell
street night ali skids through a light veers past cars
concourse night jack reaches gate sees a long line

terminal night ali races up the escalator approaching security
i have to talk to someone hes no ones allowed past this point without a boarding pass
but i have to speak to him

ali sees jack in line about to board the plane
hes wearing his ipod headset deaf to the world
all heads turn to look at her except jack who cant hear
a plump woman in front of him looks at ali
ali points to jack
the woman taps jack and points
he looks to see ali on the other side of security
jack takes his earphones off and smiles
he crosses over to her carrying his bag
they are separated by several feet of security ropes

martin looks at jack

jack drops his bag takes a running jump over the ropes and runs through the crowded concourse startling everyone
on ali as she walks through the concourse reliving her last sight of jack
as shes about to get on the escalator
jack is there
in one fantastically romantic move he pulls her into his arms kisses her deeply an epic kiss that makes passersby stop and stare
jack looks at ali
well go get em jack
he smiles then disappears into the crowd
ali stands there watching him gobsmacked by the kiss
seans car whips into the parking lot
ali jumps out and heads for the front entrance
the construction workers from the towering building across the street hoot and cat call at her
she waves to them and nods thats right boys
ali enters just as tess in a spotlight on stage turns toward the audience
she looks fabulous
only someone who knows her really well could tell shes dying inside
smoother than honey and twice as sweet
each girl lovelier then the next
gentlemen hold onto your hats
ladies hold on to your gentlemen
we may not have windows
but we do have
motions to the girls the best view on the sunset strip
the audience hoots as the burlesque girls enter the stage dancing
song tbd on ali a lightbulb going on
as tess exits the stage ali pushes through the crowd and races backstage
tess is arriving in her office defeated as ali bursts in behind her
you could knock this is still my office at least for another but this is really really tess holds up a hand
i said not yes now
god damn you are one stubborn mule of a woman
anyone else in their right mind would have figured out by now when i have something to tell you you listen
i told you i could dance did you listen
i told you i could sing did you listen
this time you are going to hear what i have to say if i have to tie you up with your corset strings and scream it in your god damn
for the first time someone silences tess
ali takes a breath
have you ever heard of air rights
two sets of fierce heels and legs stride in unison down a sidewalk
pan up as tess and ali enter
a smartly dressed businessman sits at his mahogany desk deep in a phone conversation as wham
the door to his office flies open and ali and tess stride in an overwrought assistant on their heels
jim jim hang on im gonna have to call you back jim
damnit nancy get him back
assistant scurries out
businessman turns to tess
back with more noise complaints
you offered to buy my club a few years back
i said no
and now youve changed your mind
tess smiles at him
looks at ali whos not smiling
she elbows her
ali starts smiling
tess walks up to the desk and sits herself down
ali does the same
go with me theres a good ending i promise
how much will these condos youre building sell for
they start at one million and go up depending on the view
what if i told you a twenty story high rise was going up where my club is
would twenty stories block his view
ten stories would
twenty would decimate them
leaving behind a lot of angry homeowners staring across the street at fluorescent light bulbs and dirty windows
your pretty million dollar ocean views are going away because im selling my building to a developer tomorrow wholl have his twenty stories all framed up by the time you
start selling trying to sell trying to sell these condos
i can put you in a position where your buyers could be guaranteed their million dollar views forever
as am i
as long as youre telling me youll have a check to me by today
the bumper band plays
vince sits with his posse
his cocktail waitress girlfriend approaches with an empty tray
she whispers to him sorry baby they cut you off at the bar
said you have to pay cash
i co own this goddamn place
tess comes up behind him
not anymore you dont
im buying you out
you cant do that
actually according to page of our contract i can
in the next hours
why postpone joy
she hands him a cashiers check
vince stares at it
what the hell is this
i realize its been a while since youve seen one but its called a check
he stares at it stunned
then at her
whered you get this
not your business anymore
and neither is the lounge
im sure you know where the door is
it used to be half yours
the waitress and take her with you
tess turns and goes over to the bar where ali spins around on her barstool having heard the whole thing
howd that feel
not half bad
tess parks it next to her
looks at ali
smiles then breaks into a giggle
tess laughs even harder tears in her eyes now
they are just two girls laughing hysterically at the bar tess keeps trying to say something but cant get it out until she looks ali square in the eye
it felt pretty god damn awesome
and they crack up again
and to think you didnt even want me around
oh jesus here it comes
what was it you said to me that first night
twenty bucks at the door will make all your dreams come true
that was sweet of you
are you finished
loving needling her kinda ironic when you think about it
i started off begging you to make my dreams come true and here we are all right already
you want me to say it ill say it
she looks at her
this place is the love of my life
the only dream ive ever had
i dont know what i would have done if i had lost it
a moment between them
as tess spots nikki enter the club carrying her dance bag a little fresher than weve seen her before and sober
nikki looks over at tess
ali turns away on her bar stool respectfully
i crossed the line
tess crosses her arms and with a smirk on her face again
again and i wanna come home yes again
did you fill my spot or what
what do you think
tess and nikki share a look
curtains up in
shake a leg
nikki smiles hikes her dance bag over her shoulder and heads ali looks at tess quizzically just like that
if i had a dollar for every time shes quit
we all fight
love and hate
and then make up
just like sisters
i never had a sister
now get your cute little ass and big ole voice up on stage cause this is burlesque baby girl where the women are always on top and the men like
it that way
like ive always said you cant keep a good girl down
ali walks into the dressing room
sits down in front of her mirror
across the room nikki is sitting at hers
ali looks at nikki in the reflection of her mirror
their eyes meet
then nikki nods
and ali nods back
for the first time a mutual respect
all the other girls begin to pour into the dressing room
chatting gossiping changing their clothes
the legs boobs fishnets etc
things back the way there were and the way theyll always be
she looks at herself in the mirror
picks up the make up brush tess gave her
dips it in water
then applies a line on her eye expertly
she smiles to herself
music up a heavy bass drumlin beat which takes us to
moving down the smoke filled shaft of light as a figure rises into view at the back of the stage
over the contemporary beat we hear a beautiful classic opera carmen
she sings a line or two in an amazing operatic voice that totally blows us away
a dance beat kicks in as coco comes into view and sings another line
ali rises into view wearing a diamond studded gaultier type harness top and sequined hot pants
this song to be written is a contemporary dance song about burlesque with a vintage feel to it
nikki and the burlesque girls in similar costumes back ali as she sings her big finale
camera moves through the packed house as we see georgia sean mark the dj and tess who double takes at mr
anderson the businessman who sees her and smiles
on stage ali and the entire company explode in a surreal whirl of dancing
the entire company band and bartenders join in an all out bollywood finale
camera moves into the club as music crossfades with the sounds of people talking
all the background sounds of a busy nightclub
a loud drum roll takes us to
