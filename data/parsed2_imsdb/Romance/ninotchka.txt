written by charles brackett billy wilder walter reisch based on a story by melchior lengyel camera moves to a close shot of the desk
in the background is a revolving door leading to the street
through the revolving door comes a strangely dressed individual obviously one who doesnt belong in such surroundings
it is comrade buljanoff a member of the russian board of trade
despite the spring climate of paris he still wears his typical russian clothes consisting of a coat with a fur collar a fur cap and heavy boots
buljanoff glances around the lobby obviously over whelmed by its magnificence
the manager puzzled by buljanoffs strange appearance approaches him
politely is there anything i can do for you monsieur
he exits toward the street
the manager returns to his customary duties when suddenly a second russian similarly dressed pushes his way through the door and gazes around
it is comrade iranoff
the manager definitely mystified by now approaches him
just looking around
again the manager returns to his duties when suddenly he sees that a third man dressed in the same fashion has appeared in the revolving door
it is comrade kopalski
kopalski doesnt leave the revolving door at all but as it turns drinks in the whole spectacle of the lobby
the manager is by now dumfounded
a taxi stands at the curb
buljanoff and iranoff are waiting beside it iranoff holding a suitcase
kopalski returning from the hotel joins the group
comrades why should we lie to each other
lets be honest
have we anything like it in russia
agreeing with him no no no
can you imagine what the beds would be in a hotel like that
they tell me when you ring once the valet comes in when you ring twice you get the waiter and do you know what happens when you ring three times
a maid comes in a french maid
with a gleam in his eye comrades if we ring nine times
lets go in
stopping him just a minute just a minute i have nothing against the idea but i still say lets go back to the hotel terminus
moscow made our reservations there we are on an official mission and we have no right to change the orders of our superior
where is your courage comrade buljanoff
are you the buljanoff who fought on the barricades
and now you are afraid to take a room with a bath
stepping back into the taxi i dont want to go to siberia
iranoff and kopalski follow him reluctantly
i dont want to go to the hotel terminus
if lenin were alive he would say buljanoff comrade for once in your life youre in paris
dont be a fool
go in there and ring three times
he wouldnt say that
what he would say is buljanoff you cant afford to live in a cheap hotel
doesnt the prestige of the bolsheviks mean anything to you
do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold water nothing comes out
weakening i still say our place is with the common people but who am i to contradict lenin
lets go in
all three start to leave the taxi as we buljanoff iranoff and kopalski are approaching the manager their only suitcase carried by two of them
are you the manager
eyeing the three suspiciously yes
pardon me for introducing comrade iranoff member of the russian board of trade
bowing with strained politeness monsieur
this is comrade kopalski
i am comrade buljanoff
may i ask how much your rooms are
trying to get rid of them well gentlemen im afraid our rates are rather high
why should you be afraid
the other two nod their agreement
the manager has noted the single suitcase
haughtily i might be able to accommodate you
is there some more luggage
oh yes but have you a safe here big enough to hold this
im afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault but there is one suite with a private safe
thats even better
but gentlemen i am afraid
hes always afraid
the other two exchange a look of agreement again
a little annoyed i just wanted to explain
the apartment may suit your convenience but i doubt that it will fit your convictions
its the royal suite
the mention of the royal suite startles the three
to the manager just a minute
the three russians take a step away from the manager and go into a huddle
in a low voice now comrades i warn you
if it gets out in moscow that we stay in the royal suite we will get into terrible trouble
defending his right to a good time well just say we had to take it on account of the safe
thats a perfect excuse
there was no other safe big enough
the other two welcome the suggestion with relish
good very good
suddenly buljanoff grows skeptical again
of course we could take out the pieces and distribute them in three or four boxes in the vault and take a small room
thats an idea isnt it
for a moment all three see their bright plans crumble
then iranoff comes to the rescue
yes its an idea but who says we have to have an idea
buljanoff and kopalski see the logic of this and their faces light up
turning to the manager give us the royal suite
the manager leads the three toward the elevator
the camera follows them and narrows down to the suitcase carried by two of the russians
we hear from the outside the turning of a key the opening of a door then the turning of the dial and then we see the safe door open
through the open door we now see the royal suite
the three russians are standing in front of the safe
one of them puts the suitcase into it
shooting from the interior of the room toward the safe
the three russians are standing around it
as buljanoff and iranoff close the safe door kopalski walks out of the shot
the camera stays for a few seconds on buljanoff and iranoff then pans over to the center of the room where a waiter is setting a breakfast table
he is the former count rakonin a russian exile employed by the hotel clarence
rakonin is looking with great interest toward the safe and as he does so we hear kopalskis voice talking into the telephone
will you connect me with mercier
yes the jeweler
rakonin pricks up his ears and looks toward the telephone
i want to speak with monsieur mercier personally
hello monsieur mercier
this is kopalski of the russian board of trade
we arrived this morning
as he sets the breakfast table his interest in the telephone conversation increases
yes everything is here
the necklace too
all fourteen pieces
no monsieur mercier the court jewels of the duchess swana consisted of fourteen pieces
why dont you check on that
naturally we have all the necessary credentials
as the voice continues we rakonin hurries down the stairs buttoning his overcoat around him
he exits through a door to the street
rakonin is getting into a taxi
to taxi driver eight rue de chalon
insert the house number above the doorway of a parisian apartment house
camera pulls back to medium shot of the whole entrance
into it is striding a typical parisian playboy
he is count leon dalgout
the door is being opened by swanas maid
leon enters like a man thoroughly at home
good morning count
her highness is still dressing
as he walks toward swanas door thats all right
swana sits at her dressing table in a negligee
leon enters with the easy air of an old friend
he kisses her lightly
good morning swana
during swanas long speech he sits down not paying much attention to her patter lights a cigarette and glances through a magazine
its really a wretched morning
i cant get myself right
i wanted to look mellow and i look brittle
my face doesnt compose well
how can i dim myself down leon
i am so bored with this face
i wish i had someone elses face
whose face would you have if you had your choice
oh well i guess one gets the face one deserves
your conversation has one marvelous advantage swana
however many questions you ask you never expect an answer
dont you find that restful
why didnt you come last night
darling i was busy looking out for your interests
did you win
enthusiastically we can forget horse racing roulette the stock market
our worries are over
you remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers
you will be in a position to give it to me
with humor oh leon you are so good to me
she kisses him we can be rich if you say the word
i had dinner with the guizots last night
contemptuously those newspaper people
youd be surprised how many nice people dine with the guizots
what a gruesome proof of the power of the press
now listen swana
i sold monsieur guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the gazette parisienne
the life and loves of the grand duchess swana of russia
protestingly oh leon
sweetheart we wont have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past
was it for this that i refused to endorse dr
i could have made a little fortune by saying that the vincent vacuum cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the romanoffs
and now you want them to smear my lifes secrets over the front page of a tabloid
i understand how you feel but there is a limit to everything particularly pride and dignity
they are willing to pay any price
they have a circulation of two million
imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou
think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages
i can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments
leon knows on which note to play for swanas benefit
well i am the last person to persuade you but dont do it blindly
if this is your decision you must be prepared to face the consequences
with the expression of a man ready to give his all i will have to go to work
swana rises and goes over to leon
his method has been highly successful
my little volga boatman
i dont deserve this
embracing him are you my little volga boatman
first tell me are you my little volga boatman
anything to stop her yes im your little volga boatman
walking back to the dressing table well
two million readers
i know exactly what they want
chapter one a childhood behind golden bars
lovely little princess plays with rasputins beard
leon sits down next to her growing enthusiastic
ive got one chapter guizot thinks is terrific
caviar and blood
swana escapes over the ice
a couple of bloodhounds and we have uncle toms cabin
thinking of another idea darling this would be wonderful
werent you attacked by a bolshevik
straining her memory was i
not by a bolshevik
brings our price down ten thousand francs
there is a knock on the door
the maid enters
count rakonin asks the privilege of a few words your highness
hes a waiter at the clarence poor devil
you know him
tell him i wont be able to see him for a half an hour
the count says if it could be as soon as possible
it is luncheon time and he is just between courses
the maid exits
swana walks toward the door of the living room
a charming room which manages to create a little of the atmosphere of old russia
rakonin stands his overcoat still buttoned about him waiting nervously
swana enters leaving the door ajar
rakonin approaches her with the respect he would have paid her at the imperial court
how do you do my friend
your highness forgive this intrusion but
what is it rakonin
did you lose your job
no madame something of the utmost importance
it concerns your jewels
i remember one birthday of his majesty our beloved czar
i had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace
i still see you bending before his majesty
you wore your diadem and a necklace
your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels
puzzled why do you bring this up after so many years
they are here
here in paris
do you know what you are saying
this morning three soviet agents arrived
i overheard a telephone conversation with mercier the jeweler
your highness they are going to sell them
from the door of the bedroom appears leon his face alert
did i hear something about jewels
rakonin bless him has given me the most amazing news
swana goes to the telephone
into phone balzac
to leon my lawyer
leon steps to her side highly interested
i am sorry
i have to leave
to rakonin thank you so much my friend
i will get in touch with you
count rakonin leaves
into phone this is the duchess swana
i want to speak to monsieur cornillon
its very important
please get him right away
hello monsieur cornillon
the most incredible thing has happened
my jewels are here in paris
three bolshevik swine are trying to sell them
we must act immediately
call the police
have them arrested
well then get an injunction
but do something monsieur cornillon
apparently the answer is some objection from cornillon but they are my jewels
there must be some way of getting them back
just as nervous as swana what does he say
to leon shhh
into phone but how can there be a question
are you my lawyer or theirs
all right ill let you know
she hangs up rises the legal situation whirling around in her brain
what did he say
discouraged it looks pretty hopeless
there may be a chance
the french government has recognized soviet russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake
he might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money money money
thats all they are interested in those lawyers
taking her in his arms darling calm down
why do you need a lawyer
havent you your little volga boatman
swana looks up at him hope dawning in her eyes as we spread out on a table in the royal suite
camera pulls back to a longer shot
we see mercier the jeweler examining the jewels with an eyepiece screwed in his eye
around him stand the three russians
mercier a middle aged man of the greatest suavity and elegance but a shrewd trader none the less looks up
it would be foolish to belittle the quality of the merchandise but your terms are impossible
my counteroffer is the absolute maximum
but monsieur mercier
continuing gentlemen ill let you in on a little secret
we are only undertaking this deal for the prestige involved and quite frankly we are expecting to take a loss
iranoff draws buljanoff aside and whispers in his ear
whispering capitalistic methods
they accumulate millions by taking loss after loss
the telephone rings
answering phone hello
this is buljanoff iranoff and kopalski
it must be a mistake
we cant be disturbed
continuing i assure you no one else could meet the figure named by my syndicate
at least under the present economic conditions
we can wait
pompously do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money
lets put our cards face down
right now there is a russian commission in new york trying to sell fifteen rembrandts
there is another in london mortgaging the oil fields in baku
you need money and you need it quickly
i think my offer is fair and does not even take advantage of your situation
to mercier just a minute
the three russians step to one side
in a low voice hes cutting our throat
but what can we do
we have to accept
dont lets give in so quickly
after all we have to uphold the prestige of russia
all right lets uphold it for another ten minutes
there is a knock at the door
iranoff walks toward it unlocks it opens it a little
in the door appears leon
we dont want to be disturbed
my name is count dalgout
if you want to see us you must come later
i just want a word with monsieur mercier
but you cant
leon pushes his way in
he approaches monsieur mercier
the russians get between him and the jewels and during the following scene put them back into the safe
may i introduce myself
i am count leon dalgout
i think i had the pleasure of meeting you in your beautiful shop
i was admiring a platinum watch with diamond numbers
oh yes yes
glancing at the jewels glorious arent they
now monsieur you have no right
very charmingly just a moment
to mercier i hope you havent closed this deal monsieur mercier
it might bring you into serious difficulties
who are you
what do you want
what is this
these jewels are the property of the duchess swana of russia and were seized illegally by the soviet government
i am acting for her highness the duchess
here is my power of attorney
he hands it to mercier who reads it
excitedly you know monsieur mercier this is all non sense
these may have been the jewels of the duchess swana but like all private property they were confiscated by the state
well leave the problem of their ownership to the french courts
meanwhile i have filed a petition for an injunction to prohibit you from either selling or removing the jewels
here is a copy
the russians take the copy of the injunction read it flabbergasted
as they do so leon turns to monsieur mercier
i thought it my duty to warn you
i would hate to see you get in any trouble monsieur
he turns to the russians gentlemen this introduces a new element into our negotiations
until this claim is completely settled
we can call our ambassador
i give you my word
they were confiscated legally
please try to understand my position
i am not with drawing
my offer stands and as soon as you produce a clear title approved by the french courts the deal is settled
until then good day
he bows and starts toward the door
leon accompanies him opening the door as though he were the host
intimately i hope you will forgive me monsieur mercier
in a low voice on the contrary
i consider myself very lucky
bowing good day monsieur
leon closes the door and turns back into the room to the three outraged russians
jauntily well gentlemen
how about a little lunch
get out of here
dont look so gloomy gentlemen
all is not lost
you may have a chance
bursting forth we may have a chance
a very slim one
i want to be fair
i dont deny that you might make out some kind of a case
we havent anything to discuss with you
well talk to a lawyer
all right go ahead
you talk to the lawyer and ill talk to the judge
that wont help you
you cant intimidate us
soviet russia will put all its might behind this case
you think because you represent the former duchess
the former duchess
in any case gentlemen a charming beautiful exquisite woman
i warn you if this case comes to trial it will be before a french court and when the duchess takes the stand
all right go ahead get her on the witness stand
what can she say
but how will she look
the fashions this spring are very becoming to her
gentlemen the judge will be french the jury will be french everybody in that courtroom will be french
have you ever seen a french court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little
you sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you
i suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels
oh no no
i am not a highwayman im just a nuisance
all im trying to do is make things as difficult as possible
not that we are giving in one inch but tell us
what is in your mind
well gentlemen how about my proposition
i just said lets have a little lunch
picking up the telephone room service
shooting toward door leading to the royal suite
two waiters are wheeling in a table on which is a block of ice filled with caviar and a collection of the most delicious hors doeuvres
they enter the room
after the door is closed we hear from within loud sounds of approval from buljanoff iranoff and kopalski
the camera stays on the door
after a few seconds a very good looking cigarette girl enters the room and from within we hear even louder sounds of approval
next a waiter enters carrying champagne and another with glasses on a tray
as they are going into the room the cigarette girl comes out and runs excitedly down the corridor
camera pans with her away from the door as she starts down the staircase
some of the waiters come out others go in carrying further delicacies
up the staircase pants the cigarette girl followed by two other cigarette girls
camera pans with them as they rush toward the door of the royal suite and enter
from within we hear terrific greetings
the camera remains on the door as we slowly dissolve into evening
the electric lights are lit and a band of five hungarian musicians enters carrying typical hungarian instruments including a cimbalom
the orchestra is playing the three russians very high by now are dancing with the girls
one of them is wearing the cigarette tray of one of the girls
it is a harmless but loud and hilarious party
apart from all the hullabaloo sits leon at the desk a telegraph blank before him
the three come to him all in the gayest most agreeable mood
pawing him what is it my boy
about this telegram to moscow
why should you bother
ill write it for you
he embraces leon why are you so good to us
he kisses leon kissing leon too leon my little boy
joining them oh leon you are so good
freeing himself as best he can whats the name of that commissar on the board of trade
writing razinin board of trade moscow
you wouldnt like razinin
hes a bad man
sends people to siberia
we dont like razinin
again pawing leon we like you leon dont we like leon
the others join him and kiss leon
yes we like leon
this brings on a new frenzy of russian affection
leon frees himself and rises
how does this strike you
commissar razinin board of trade moscow
unexpected situation here
duchess swana in paris claims jewels and has already brought injunction against sale or removal
after long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty fifty settlement as best solution
iranoff buljanoff and kopalski
if we say that leon
well be sent to siberia
and if we have to go to siberia
still looking over the telegram ill send you a muff
oh why are you so good to us
yes you are so good leon
again they overwhelm leon with an avalanche of russian affection
at this moment rakonin enters with some new bottles of champagne
the russians immediately leave leon and direct their affection toward rakonin embracing and kissing him
comrade waiter dear waiteritchka
why are you so good to us
you good waiter
after rakonin has turned over the champagne to the russians leon takes him aside
take this telegram to the telegraph office at once
he leaves the room
rakonin comes out with the telegram
the camera pans with him as he hurries down the corridor reading it
the camera narrows down on an insert of the telegram as we pan down past the roof of an official building to a close shot of a window
behind it stands razinin reading the telegram
he is a violent militant bolshevik
the telegram fills him with rage
as he crumples it and stares into space his expression bodes ill for buljanoff iranoff and kopalski
shooting toward door of elevator
the elevator comes up and stops the door opens and the three russians step out
they are very smartly dressed and look like any urbane gentlemen coming from the races
two of them have racing glasses
as they walk toward the royal suite lady lavenham an elderly english aristocrat comes out of her room
good afternoon messieurs mes comrades
good afternoon lady lavenham
and how is lord lavenham
and little lady beatrice
did fortune favor you at the races
comme ci comme ca
nothing to write home about
alarmed who wants to write home about it
its just a saying
how about joining us saturday night for dinner
were having a few friends
are we free buljanoff
then lets say at nine
black tie or white tie
oh lets make it white
as they walk into the royal suite buljanoff tosses off an urbane comment
as the three enter the telephone rings
buljanoff and kopalski go into the living room
iranoff answers the telephone
into telephone yes leon
a little bit annoyed what is it leon
you cant hurry such things
you must give moscow a little time
theres nothing we can do about it
why dont you drop in later
he steps into the living room
as iranoff enters buljanoff rushes toward him
what is it
a telegram from moscow
it must have been here all day
joining them and reading telegram halt negotiations immediately
envoy extraordinary arrives thursday six ten with full power
your authority cancelled herewith
it is thursday
its six oclock already
they rush into the bedroom
i always said it would be siberia
manager at desk
iranoff buljanoff and kopalski rush from the direction of the elevator
iranoff pauses at the desk
the others go on to the door and wait for him there
to manager a special envoy is coming from moscow
hell occupy the royal suite
move our things to the smallest room youve got
from the door buljanoff and kopalski call impatiently
as he starts toward the door we the train has already arrived as the three russians hurry down the platform
neither do they know the name of the envoy extraordinary nor his appearance and they are searching the crowd for some clue
this is a fine thing
maybe weve missed him already
how can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like
iranoff points to a bearded man with a knapsack
that must be the one
yes he looks like a comrade
they follow the man but just as they are ready to approach him he is greeted by a german girl
both raise their hands in the nazi salute
as the two embrace the three russians stop in their tracks
no thats not him
by now the platform is almost empty
as the russians in the foreground look around helplessly we see in the background a woman who obviously is also looking for someone
it is ninotchka yakushova the envoy extraordinary
the russians exchange troubled looks and go toward her
ninotchka comes forward
as they meet she speaks
to iranoff i am looking for michael simonovitch iranoff
i am michael simonovitch iranoff
i am nina ivanovna yakushova envoy extraordinary acting under direct orders of comrade commissar razinin
present me to your colleagues
they shake hands
ninotchkas grip is strong as a mans
what a charming idea for moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade
if we had known we would have greeted you with flowers
sternly dont make an issue of my womanhood
we are here for work
all of us
lets not waste time
shall we go
the russians are taken aback
as ninotchka bends down to lift her two suitcases iranoff calls porter
a porter steps up to them
what do you want
may i have your bags madame
he is a porter
he wants to carry them
to porter why
why should you carry other peoples bags
thats my business madame
thats no business
thats a social injustice
that depends on the tip
trying to take ninotchkas bags allow me comrade
no thank you
ninotchka takes both suitcases and walks away with the three russians whose nervousness has increased with every word from the envoy extraordinary
how are things in moscow
the last mass trials were a great success
there are going to be fewer but better russians
the hearts of the three russians drop to their boots as we ninotchka followed by the russians comes through the lobby observing every detail of these unfamiliar surroundings
suddenly she stops
in the showcase of a hat shop in the lobby is displayed a hat of the john frederics type
its a hat comrade a womans hat
ninotchka shakes her head
tsk tsk tsk how can such a civilization survive which permits women to put things like that on their heads
it wont be long now comrades
she walks out of the shot toward the elevator followed by the three russians as we ninotchka enters followed by the three russians who by now are frightened to death
this is the apartment we have reserved for you comrade yakushova
i hope you like it
glancing around the tremendous room which part of the room is mine
it is a little different here
they dont rent rooms in pieces
we had to take the whole suite
ninotchka begins to unpack her things and puts her typewriter on the desk
how much does this cost
two thousand francs
do you know how much a cow costs comrade iranoff
two thousand francs
if i stay here a week i will cost the russian people seven cows
with an outburst of emotion who am i to cost the russian people seven cows
we had to take it on account of the safe
we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants quarters
ninotchka takes lenins picture from her bags
i am ashamed to put the picture of lenin in a room like this
she puts the photograph on the desk comrades your telegram was received with great disfavor in moscow
we did our best comrade
i hope so for your sake
she sits at her desk and starts to type her report let us examine the case
what does the lawyer say
you didnt get legal advice
we didnt want to get mixed up with lawyers
they are very expensive here
if you just say hello to a lawyer
well there goes another cow
we dealt directly with the representative of the grand duchess
i am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture
i will not repeat your mistake
i will have no dealings with the grand duchess nor her representative
ninotchka continues to type
the three russians watch her nervously
each click pounds on their consciences
looking up comrade buljanoff
do you spell buljanoff with one or two fs
with fright in his voice with two fs if you please
ninotchka goes on with her typing
suddenly she looks up at iranoff who becomes self conscious and fixes his tie
as he does so he sees that ninotchkas glance is concentrated on the spats which he was wearing and in his hurry forgot to remove
he knows it is too late to do anything about it except to stand one foot behind the other as ninotchka types faster the clicking of her keys twice as
ninotchka picks up the telephone
into phone will you send me some cigarettes please
suddenly getting up comrades i am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the state
with utmost gravity you were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry
why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time
our next years crop is in danger and you know it
unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people
and you three comrades
we did it with the best intentions
we cannot feed the russian people on your intentions
fifty per cent to a so called duchess
half of every loaf of bread to our enemy
comrade kopalski go at once to our embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in paris
you comrade iranoff go to the public library and get me the section of the civil code on property
is there anything i can do comrade
you might get me an accurate map of paris
i want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city
the buzzer rings
the three cigarette girls enter
ninotchka looks up astonished
seeing her the cigarette girls freeze
the russians stand by quietly
looking at the russians comrades you seem to have been smoking a lot
shooting past the desk toward the revolving door
the telephone rings and the desk clerk answers
yes monsieur kopalski
he writes down the message you are expecting count dalgout
but he is not to go to the royal suite under any circumstances
he should go to your new room
thank you monsieur
he hangs up the receiver a few seconds later ninotchka naturally completely unaware of the telephone conversation passes by
she carries a map in her hand
good evening madame
she exits out the door
ninotchka emerges unfolds the map
in the hands of ninotchka
the camera zooms down to a close up of the little drawing of the hotel clarence on the map
the camera then pans over from the clarence toward the opposite side of the street but before we reach the opposite side we see that in the center of the
street is a little isle of safety
the camera proceeds panning to the opposite side of the square and we the real location corresponding to that seen on the map and seen from the same angle
it is evening and along the street comes leon on his way to the hotel
the camera pans with him as he crosses the street
he reaches the isle of safety and there passes ninotchka who has come from the other side
they pass on the little isle without noticing each other
suddenly we hear the whistle of a traffic policeman and both ninotchka and leon have to step back to the little isle
on the little isle
wanting some information ninotchka turns to him completely impersonal
could you give me some information
how long do we have to wait here
well until the policeman whistles again
at what intervals does he whistle
how many minutes between the first and second whistle
i never gave it a thought before
have you never been caught in a similar situation
do you know when i come to think about it its staggering
if i add it all up i must have spent years waiting for signals
an important part of my life wasted between whistles
in other words you dont know
ninotchka gets out her map starts to unfold it
can i help you
you might hold this for me
engrossed in her geography correct me if i am wrong
we are facing north arent we
bewildered facing north
id hate to commit myself without my compass
are you an explorer
i am looking for the eiffel tower
is that thing lost again
if you are interested in a view
i am interested in the eiffel tower from a technical standpoint
i couldnt help you from that angle
you see a real parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off
how long does it take a man to land
now isnt that too bad
the last time i jumped i forgot to clock it
looks at map let me see
your finger please
he takes her finger and points to the map with it
skeptically why do you need my finger
bad manners to point with your own
the eiffel tower
and where are we
shifting her finger back to the hotel here
here we are
here you are and here i am
i am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points
must you flirt
i dont have to but i find it natural
ninotchka starts to fold her map
for my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale
madame it is that kind of approach which has made paris what it is
you are very sure of yourself arent you
nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence
i have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society
it is having a superior earning power that makes you like that
i love russians
i have been fascinated by your five year plan for the past fifteen years
your type will soon be extinct
she walks away from him coldly
leon stares after her fascinated
camera moves with ninotchka as she enters
she approaches an attendant
can you tell me the exact width of the foundation on which the piers are resting
and the depth
you dont have to worry
the thing is safe
i am not afraid
i want to know
leon who apparently has taken a taxi and prepared himself otherwise enters the scene reading from a book
reading the foundation is one hundred and forty one yards square
he tips his hat and interjects i hope youll forgive me but i thought youd
interrupting go ahead
the camera goes with ninotchka and leon as they walk toward the steps
continuing four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty six feet on the side of the seine and twenty nine and one half feet on the
the girders of interlaced iron work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty four degrees
thats a strange angle
yes very strange
by now they have reached the staircase
they start up
continuing to read ascending to the tower is a staircase consisting of eight hundred and twenty nine steps
this disclosure frightens leon as he realizes the climb ahead of him
he reads on as they walk up and an additional two hundred and fifty four steps to the very top
now leon stops but ninotchka proceeds on out of the picture
leon calls after her and reads from his book in a loud voice there is an elevator included in the price of admission
ninotchka continues to climb
ninotchka paying no attention to him walks up the stairs two at a time
he looks after ninotchka then makes up his mind and returns down the stairs
ground floor eiffel tower shooting toward the elevator door
the elevator with several passengers is just about to leave when leon hurries into it
the door closes and the elevator starts to ascend quickly
the camera angle includes the elevator door and a beautiful background view of paris
the elevator door opens and leon emerges leisurely
he is just about to step to the top of the staircase when suddenly to his great amazement he sees ninotchka who stands at the balustrade overlooking paris
she has climbed the tower faster than he despite the elevator
dumbfounded leon approaches her
ninotchka turns very matter of fact
you gave me some very valuable information
looking at the dazzling view and thank you for getting me up here
ive never seen this before
beautiful isnt it
yes it is
im glad i saw it before becoming extinct
do not misunderstand me
i do not hold your frivolity against you
she looks him up and down as basic material you might not be bad but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture
i feel sorry for you
you must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles
night view of paris with its lights ablaze as seen from the eiffel tower
i do not deny its beauty but it is a waste of electricity
what a city
there are the grands boulevards
blasted out of the heart of the old streets
the arc de triomphe
made to greet napoleons army
and now ill show you the greatest attraction
he steps to a telescope and taking some money from his pocket drops a coin in the slot it will cost me a franc but it is worth it
he adjusts the telescope the most wonderful spot in all paris unique
she looks in telescope what do you see
i see a house that looks like any other house
whats remarkable about it
its not the structure but the spirit which dwells within
there are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality
so that is your house
well lets say i live in it
such a pleasant place
all kinds of comfort easy to reach close to street car bus and subway
straight from the shoulder does that mean that you want me to go there
feeling that he has offended her please dont misunderstand me
then you dont want me to go there
in a pickle now i didnt say that either
naturally nothing would please me more
simply then why dont we go
looking at him you might be an interesting subject of study
i will do my best
they walk toward the elevator as we in the foreground stands a console on which is a telephone
gaston leons elderly dignified butler is answering the phone
into phone no
count dalgout is still out
yes as soon as he returns ill tell him
ill tell him monsieur buljanoff
he puts down the receiver as leon opens the door with his key
ninotchka and leon enter
ninotchka during the following scene is studying every detail of the apartment with the eye of a technical expert
good evening gaston
good evening monsieur
is this what you call the butler
takes gastons hand good evening comrade
to leon this man is horribly old
you should not make him work
he takes good care of that
he looks sad
do you whip him
no though the mere thought makes my mouth water
to the completely flabbergasted gaston the day will come when you will be free
go to bed little father
we want to be alone
leon opens the door to the living room
just as he is about to follow her gaston addresses him
in a low voice count dalgout there have been several telephone
go to bed
leon enters the room
closes the door
ninotchka is examining the room
well may i offer you a drink or how about something to eat
ive had all the calories necessary for today
leon feels a little uncertain as to how to approach this creature
what do we do now
we take off our hat and coat
he takes her things we sit down we make ourselves comfortable
we adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening
we look at each other
ninotchka doesnt respond well
we dont smile
how about some music
is that customary
it has ever since king david wooed bathsheba with the harp
as i am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand i shall turn on the radio
the observer i should say this room is eighteen by twenty five
not too big and not too small
what id call the typical room of an average man
or shall we say a little above average
now if there are any special aspects you wish to study i have nothing to conceal
just look around
thats my desk
those are my books and here am i
where shall we begin
i will start with you
im thirty five years old
just over six feet tall
i weigh a hundred and eighty two pounds stripped
and what is your profession
keeping my body fit keeping my mind alert keeping my landlord appeased
thats a full time job
and what do you do for mankind
for mankind not a thing for womankind the record is not quite so bleak
you are something we do not have in russia
that is why i believe in the future of my country
i begin to believe in it myself since ive met you
i still dont know what to make of it
it confuses me it frightens me a little but it fascinates me ninotchka
you pronounce it incorrectly
that is correct
ninotchka do you like me just a little bit
your general appearance is not distasteful
look at me
the whites of your eyes are clear
your cornea is excellent
your cornea is terrific
tell me youre so expert on things can it be that im falling in love with you
you are bringing in wrong values
love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological or shall we say chemical process
a lot of nonsense is talked and written about it
oh i see
what do you use instead
i acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all
what can i possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you
you dont have to do a thing
chemically we are already quite sympathetic
bewildered and yet completely intrigued youre the most improbable creature ive ever met in my life ninotchka ninotchka
you repeat yourself
id like to say it a thousand times
dont do it please
im at a loss ninotchka
you must forgive me if i appear a little old fashioned
after all im just a poor bourgeois
its never too late to change
i used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself
my father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm but i preferred the bayonet
bewildered the bayonet
did you really
i was wounded before warsaw
i was a sergeant in the third cavalry brigade
would you like to see my wound
dumfounded id love to
she pulls the blouse off her shoulder and shows him her scar tsk tsk tsk
a polish lancer
i was sixteen
poor poor ninotchka
readjusting her blouse dont pity me
pity the polish lancer
after all im alive
more and more puzzled and fascinated leon sits down close to her
what kind of a girl are you anyway
just what you see
a tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution
youre the most adorable cog i ever saw in my life
ninotchka cogitska let me confess something
never did i dream i could feel like this toward a sergeant
a clock strikes
do you hear that
its twelve oclock
one half of paris is making love to the other half
look at the clock
one hand has met the other hand
isnt that wonderful
thats the way a clock works
theres nothing wonderful about it
you merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration
i cant possibly think of a better reason
its false sentimentality
trying desperately to make her mood more romantic you analyze everything out of existence
you analyze me out of existence
i wont let you
love is not so simple
ninotchka ninotchka why do doves bill and coo
why do snails coldest of all creatures circle interminably around each other
why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates
why do flowers open their petals
oh ninotchka ninotchka surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion
a general warmth in the palms of your hands
a strange heaviness in your limbs
a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing more exalting than thirst
he pauses waiting for the results of his speech
you are very talkative
that is too much for leon
he takes her into his arms and kisses her
was that talkative
no that was restful
leon kisses her again
oh my barbaric ninotchka
my impossible unromantic statistical
the telephone rings
continuing glorious analytical
the telephone is ringing
oh let it ring
but one of your friends may be in need of you
you must answer
leon exits out of shot to answer telephone
leon enters sits down takes the telephone
into phone hello
im sorry but i couldnt make it
i ran into a friend from the army
the deal is off
are you crazy buljanoff
she is startled by the name
a special envoy arrived
that sounds better
ill be glad to see her any time she wants
oh she doesnt want to see me
what do you know about that
well ill get in touch with her myself
whats her name
he takes a pencil and a piece of paper what
how do you spell it
those russian names
he starts to write it down i
camera pulls back and ninotchka enters the shot
she takes pencil from leons hand writes out the name and leaves again
at first leon is not aware of the full significance of her action
then it dawns on him
at last the situation is entirely clear to him
into phone all right
he hangs up and stares at ninotchka
she is putting on her jacket
camera panning with him as he walks over to her ninotchka
he takes her arm
i must go
ninotchka or shall i say special envoy yakushova
lets forget that we ever met
i have a better suggestion
lets forget that the telephone ever rang
i never heard that you are yakushova
you are ninotchka
firmly i was sent here by my country to fight you
all right fight me fight me as much as you want but fight me tomorrow morning
theres nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy
uncompromisingly as a representative of moscow
tonight lets not represent anybody but ourselves
it is out of the question
if you wish to approach me
you know i want to
then do it through my lawyer
desperate ninotchka you cant walk out like this
im crazy about you and i thought id made an impression on you
you liked the white of my eye
ninotchka looks at him for a second then pulls herself together
i must go
she starts for the door
but ninotchka i held you in my arms
you kissed me
i kissed the polish lancer too
before he died
as she goes out we note we have to invent some brief scene to indicate that three days have gone by
from this we the butler opens the door
swana enters her manner showing her complete familiarity with the place
good morning your highness
good morning gaston
count dalgout is still asleep
as she walks toward leons room thats all right
the curtains are drawn
the night light is still on
leon a dressing gown over his pajamas is sound asleep in a big arm chair
as swana enters she sees him with some alarm
what in heavens name
is anything wrong
are you ill
dont tell me the bed has lost its best friend
i just couldnt sleep
i got up and went back
and then got up again
these last few days
darling youre taking my business affairs far too seriously
much as id love to rob the bolsheviks of their filthy money i wont do it at the expense of your health
particularly as we know we wont get much
tenderly you look so pale
pale but interesting
there is a knock at the door
gaston enters with a breakfast tray
your breakfast monsieur
i dont feel like any breakfast
how can you fight the reds and make yourself agreeable to the whites if you dont keep up your strength
shall i draw your bath sir
make it ice cold
not in your condition
to gaston make it tepid gaston
tepid and tender
and lay out his gray suit
to leon afterwards ill drive you through the bois
in waltz time
a blue shirt perhaps
lets offset his mood
find a striped one and brighten it with a great blaze of tie
very well your highness
gaston disappears into the bath dressing room
swana makes leon sit down and seats herself beside him
here we have two very handsome soft boiled eggs
do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs
they have such unfeeling eyes
well put in a great nugget of butter plenty of pepper and salt
darling i havent seen you for three livelong days
seventy two hours
irritably oh please swana
i dont know whether im standing on my head or my heels
here you are blaming me for neglecting you when im trying to concentrate on another woman and cant get near her
you havent seen her yet
no and believe me ive tried everything
i must have telephoned her a hundred times
ive sent her telegrams ive sent her flowers
i asked her to dinner
i offered her seats for the opera
in the old days wed have had her flogged
that wouldnt have done any good
not with her
forgetting himself shes the most incredible creature ive ever seen
you just told me you hadnt seen her
i caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby
imagine the carpets of a self respecting parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik
what does she look like
you cant imagine
leon nods old or young
when she comes into a room youd think that the bolsheviks had taken over paris
she wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by schiaparelli
what a woman
what a woman
there is a russian snowstorm in each of her eyes
you saw all that in one glimpse
getting up darling if were going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open
he walks over to the bathroom now darling soak in your beautiful pine bath and let gaston shave you
leon exits into the bathroom
as he does so a bell rings
there is no answer
after a slight pause she herself goes to answer the bell
medium shot entrance hall leons apartment shooting toward the door
swana goes to the door and opens it
the three russians stand outside
seeing swana they are a little intimidated
how do you do
swana suspects that for the first time she is being confronted by representatives of the soviet government
we want to talk to count dalgout
my name is kopalski
you are the three gentlemen from moscow
icily you may wait
she closes the door
the three russians very impressed stand looking at the door which has just been closed
the niece of the czar opening the door for us
once in petersburg i was driving down the nevsky prospect in my cart and her highness in her troika swept down from the opposite direction and when i couldnt make
way quick enough she spat in my face
now look here buljanoff
you never were in petersburg you never owned a cart and she never spat in your face
who are you trying to impress
at this moment the door is opened by leon in his bathrobe
come in come in
leon and the three russians enter
excitedly leon leonitchka she is not going to negotiate
she is going to fight that injunction
shes going to make a precedent of it
she says she wont be intimidated by parasites
she called the duchess a blood sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer
eagerly what did she say about me
after a moments consideration i think she covered you with the parasites
leon is disappointed
what she said about us
and they might believe her in moscow
what do you mean they might they will
we dont blame you leon but when we came from russia we believed in simplicity
we avoided luxury and extravagance and today
well if you were to offer us a glass of champagne we wouldnt say no
leon is so engrossed in his thoughts that he overlooks the hint
well boys id like to help you but what can i do
yesterday i waited six hours in the lobby
she doesnt leave her room
she has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books
all right then make an appointment with her so i can see her
but you are so ingenious leon
you found your way to us and we werent easy to reach were we
didnt we put up a strong resistance
oh yes yes
you must help us leon
if you dont win her over were on our way to siberia
or it might be the firing squad
or we cant go back to russia
an idea dawns on iranoff
whats wrong with that
kopalski and buljanoff seize on the same idea
we could stay with leon
leon how would you like to have three lifelong friends
dont forget russia is your mother country
three sons walking out all at once
thats too much for any mother
well if your mother turns against you you have to look for someone to adopt you
swanas voice comes from the next room
just a minute
leon goes back to the other room
leons bedroom close shot shooting toward the door of the living room
swana stands putting on her gloves
im leaving dear
im lunching at fouquets if you can make it and
leon remember a man should think it over twice before he decides to become a mother
she kisses him lightly and walks out
it is piled deep with law books and papers
ninotchka sits at it conferring with two lawyers
uncertainly i seem to remember some additional injunctive provision dealing with the property of foreigners residing in france
with the precision of a machine you are referring to paragraph b section f of the civil code
the lawyers exchange a glance of surprise at her knowledge
one of them takes up one of the law books and as he starts to look up the case ninotchka speaks
page eight hundred twenty four
again the lawyers exchange a glance of astonishment
and do not fail to read the three footnotes
while you are studying it i will eat
she picks up the telephone food please
rakonin is answering the telephone
into phone room service
just a moment please
he beckons to someone out of the scene
leon enters the scene and takes the telephone
with an assumed french accent into phone room service speaking
into phone send me a plate of raw carrots and beets beets predominating on a ratio of sixty forty
there is a strike in the kitchen
will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause
i hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables
you wont serve me either
now look here comrade i think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me youre weakening the people
into phone so
you want to make a strike breaker out of me
i am surprised at you comrade
is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch
all i can say to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that royal suite
he hangs up the telephone with a triumphant smile
ninotchka emerges from the elevator and starts toward the street
as she passes the showcase of the millinery shop again she stops and looks at the same hat
again she shakes her head sadly
tsk tsk tsk
she walks toward the street as we a taxi is parked at the curb
ninotchka comes from the hotel and goes to the taxi
the driver puts his hand on the handle of his cabs door expectantly
where to madame
can you recommend a restaurant
well theres pruniers if you care for seafood
if you want to lunch in the bois theres
interrupting where do you eat
at pere mathieus
where is that
its just a place for workmen
where is it
eight blocks down in the rue de poivrel
he opens the door of his cab
she turns and starts away in the direction he has indicated
the driver looks after her astounded
the camera pans from her to the car which stands behind the taxi
it is leons smart roadster
leon sits at the wheel
he too is looking after ninotchka astonished
he gets out of his car and starts in the direction she has taken
as he does so we pere mathieus is a workmans restaurant set a few steps below the level of the sidewalk
a few typical french workmen are going in for lunch
ninotchka enters the scene looks around for a second then goes in too
it is a pleasantly simple place crowded with workmen sitting at lunch
an electric piano is playing
pere mathieu greeting all his guests like a typical restaurateur sees ninotchka enter
this way madame
are you alone
by the window perhaps
he leads the way or a nice little corner table
this will do
she sits down i think this is the first time you have been to my little place
your face is new to me
now what shall it be
raw carrots and beets
horrified oh madame
this is a restaurant not a meadow
he hands her a slate on which the menu is written
here is what we are offering today
please make your choice
i am sure you will find something to tempt your appetite
suddenly ninotchka stares in the direction of the door
leon has just entered
the camera follows him as he makes his way casually in ninotchkas direction affecting not to see her
he seats himself at the table directly opposite ninotchka and pretends to be overwhelmed with surprise as he sees her
it certainly is a small world
to ninotchka well madame
shall we start with soup
fish soup today
i got up at five to fish them from the seine
calling over to pere mathieu crayfish soup for me
to leon very well monsieur
back to ninotchka then may i suggest an omelet with mushrooms
bring me something simple
i never think about food
horrified but madame
if you dont think about food what do you think about
the future of the common people
sagely that also is a question of food madame
ill bring you a nice little lunch a la pere mathieu
he exits leon leans toward ninotchka with mock humility
pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him you know that
you hurt his feelings
it was just like telling a musician you dont like music
that good old man believes in food as you believe in karl marx
you cant go around hurting people comrade yakushova but maybe you can make it up to him
do you know how
he changes to the chair at his table which is closest to her table by eating everything with relish by drinking everything with gusto by having a good time for
the first time in your natural life
i dont like your following me
i didnt follow you
then how did you get here
i always eat here
this is a place for workmen
laying it on thick but my dear child i am most at home among working men
i hate the places where you circulate the hotel clarence
this is my natural element
after all what are any of us
at least those of us who are worth our salt
he waves off scene to a truckman
he is in the middle of an enormous gulp of food
he registers surprise winks at his companion and then deciding to humor a drunk waves back energetically at leon in greeting
leon has been so successful with the truckman he tries it on another
another truckman responds with equal exuberance
leon intoxicated with his success waves to the whole room
he gets a wonderful response from all
they realize that a swell drunk is among them
boastfully they are all my friends
theyre a swell bunch
pere mathieu enters the shot and serves a plate of soup to leon and one to ninotchka
trying his bluff on pere mathieu ah my friend
im happy to see you again
im always glad to meet a new customer and i hope this first visit will not be your last
he exits out of shot
ninotchka her suspicion confirmed looks at leon
just an old man
his memory is getting weak
what are you after
must one always be after something
your tactics are useless
my name is neither buljanoff iranoff nor kopalski
oh ninotchka who wants to talk business
if you win the suit fine
if we win the suit better
you do me an injustice
he moves over to her table leaving the soup at his table when we went to my apartment did i have the slightest idea that you had any connection with
but you have now and i know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in russia would be punished by death
always so glum
what about life ninotchka
do russians never think of life
of the moment in which we are living
the only moment we really have
dont take it all so seriously ninotchka
nothing is worth it
i beg you sergeant
will you smile
at the whole ludicrous spectacle of life
at people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance
if you cant find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me
because we are an odd couple
then you should go back to your table
no i cant leave you
not until ive made you laugh
at least once
to get rid of him ninotchka emits a joyless sound which approximates a laugh
now go back
thats not a laugh
i mean a laugh from the heart
now lets see
im going to tell you a funny story
just a moment
ive got it
well it seems there were a couple of frenchmen who went to america
on which boat
thrown off by her methodical thinking well er
lets drop it
i dont think you would care for that one
do you like scotch stories
i have never heard one
two scotchmen met on the street
and i dont know the name of the street and it really doesnt matter
well anyway ones name was mcintosh and the others was mcgillicuddy
mcintosh says to mcgillicuddy hello mr
mcgillicuddy and mcgillicuddy says to mcintosh hello mr
mcintosh and then mcintosh says to mcgillicuddy how is mrs
and then mcgillicuddy says to mcintosh how is mrs
i wish they had never met
disarmed so do i
after a little pause now heres a great one
he looks at ninotchka and her expression stops him well maybe its not so good
lets forget it
two men are looking at the moon
one says to the other is it true that a lot of people live on the moon
yes it is says the other five hundred million
replies the first they must get pretty crowded when its half moon
there is no response from ninotchka
starting to get sore i suppose you dont think thats funny
it seemed funny to me when i first heard it
maybe the trouble isnt with the joke
maybe its with you
i dont think so
maybe you havent any sense of humor
well ill give you one more chance
he gets up and speaks in a threatening voice audible to the entire room
when i heard this joke for the first time i laughed myself sick
a man comes into a restaurant and sits down and says waiter
get me a cup of coffee without cream
after five minutes the waiter comes back and says im sorry sir were all out of cream can it be without milk
they have overheard the story and all burst into laughter
ninotchka continues to eat her soup without a shadow of a laugh
furious not funny huh
so you dont think thats funny
it is funny
everyone else thinks so
maybe you didnt get it
he sits down again
threateningly ill tell you that joke again
a man comes into a restaurant
did you get that
he sits down at the table and says to the waiter
did you get that too
well so far it isnt funny but wait
he says to the waiter waiter
bring me a cup of coffee
so the waiter comes back five minutes later and says im sorry sir we have no coffee
he realizes he has made a mistake wait a minute
wait a minute
im all mixed up
he starts over again a man comes in a restaurant he sits down he calls the waiter and he says waiter
get me a cup of coffee without cream and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says im sorry sir we have no cream can it be a glass
he gets up and goes over to his table furiously
you have no sense of humor
that settles it
you have no sense of humor
in his excitement he leans on the shaky table
it topples forward
simultaneously his feet shoot from under him and he sits violently on the floor the contents of the table crashing about him hot soup in his face
a terrific roar of laughter arises the whole restaurant is rocking with laughter
for a split second ninotchka makes an effort to control the irresistible impulse to laugh but loses the battle and herself roars with laughter
indignantly whats funny about this
ninotchkas laughter is uncontrollable
after a moment leon gets up and sits next to her
as he dries himself with his napkin he sees the humor of the situation and starts to howl with laughter too
the ice is broken at last
on their mutual wild hilarity we a conference is in session ninotchka her two lawyers and the three russians
ninotchka sits at the desk leaning back in the chair looking into space and apparently weighing every point which is brought up
one of the lawyers is reading from a document
reading in addition to the arguments above enumerated for lifting this injunction we wish to cite the decision of the high court of paris rendered in the case of princess
marishka against the government of montenegro on the fifth day of august
comparing the facts in that case with our present set of facts we feel that the treaty between the republic of france and the u
should prevail over all
suddenly ninotchka laughs
everyone looks at her astonished
ninotchka gets up
im sorry gentlemen
the other day i heard such a funny story
she laughs again it still makes me laugh
it is very funny
a little embarrassed i am sorry
about this injunction
very businesslike the hearing is set for the twentieth of this month
not thinking of the injunction thats two weeks from thursday
we did our utmost to have it set ahead
her attitude completely different from her former business conferences i know gentlemen but it is in the hands of the court
were helpless arent we
it is unfortunate
well theres nothing we can do about it
why get excited
the three russians as well as the lawyers are puzzled
the russians exchange hopeful glances
well leave these papers here for your further consideration
au revoir madame
the lawyers leave
left alone with the russians ninotchka is unable to conceal her happiness entirely
well it means another two weeks in paris
with exaggerated efficiency too bad we have to waste all that time
i acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the power and light authorities
whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you
a little bit dreamily oh yes power and light
theres something else which i know will appeal to you
a visit to the paris sewers
they tell me it is extremely instructive
why dont you get a haircut buljanoff
you all look so wintry comrades
and why do we always keep the windows closed
she opens the window isnt it amazing at home theres still snow and ice and here
look at the birds
i always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries
now i know why
we have the high ideal but they have the climate
well comrades i dont think i need you any more
if there is anything we can do for you
no not a thing
would you like to go out
thank you comrade
have you any money
the russians stammer a negative answer
smiling benevolently ninotchka goes to the table takes several bills from her handbag and goes back extending a fifty franc bill to kopalski
well here are fifty francs
overwhelmed thank you comrade thank you
bring me forty five back
terribly disappointed naturally comrade
the three russians leave
ninotchka waits a moment
then hurries to the door and turns the key
camera follows her as she goes into the bedroom
she proceeds to the door leading to the corridor and turns its key
she goes to the table and takes a little key from her handbag goes to the bureau and unlocks the drawer opens it and just as she is about to
take out something her eye falls on the night table where she sees the picture of lenin which she brought with her from moscow
she walks over to it and turns its face against the wall then goes back to the bureau and takes from the drawer the very hat which twice aroused her
disapproval when it was displayed in the millinery shop in the lobby
she moves over to the large mirror puts the hat on her head is uncertain whether it is right side to fore and changes it
she looks at herself aghast at seeing a complete stranger
she sits down still staring in the mirror then leans forward and rests her chin on her hand
as she sits studying the new ninotchka suspiciously we it is evening
leon is walking nervously up and down
gaston is puttering over the drink table
consulting his watch what time have you gaston
eight forty two sir
i guess it is eight forty two
you seem to be a bit nervous sir
i am gaston
if you will forgive me ever since you met that bolshevik lady ive noticed a distinct change in you sir
complacently have you
yesterday i was greatly amazed when i came from the market and found that you had made your bed sir
and gaston i was happier all day long
i felt id contributed something
well sir if you should do it again which i hope you wont please remember the order
counterpane blanket blanket sheet sheet
ah theres something poetic about the simple processes of labor
counterpane blanket blanket sheet sheet
it should be set to music
may i add sir that it was with great amazement that i found a copy of karl marxs capital on your night table
that is a socialistic volume which i refuse to so much as dust sir
i view with alarm sir the influence over you of this bolshevik lady
i cant follow you gaston isnt it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position
you being my servant
wouldnt you like to stand on an equal footing with me
isnt there any revolt in you
sometimes when i order you around dont you feel like kicking me in the pants
emphatically no sir
oh youre a reactionary
dont you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say hey you dalgout
from now on its going to be share and share alike
outraged emphatically not sir
the prospect terrifies me
now dont misunderstand me sir i dont resent your not paying me for the past two months but the thought that i should split my bank account with you
that you should take half of my lifes savings
that is really too much for me
the door bell rings
gaston starts for the door
with a gesture leon stops him
go to bed little father go to bed
gaston leaves through the other door as leon exits toward the entrance hall
leon enters the scene
he opens the door
outside stands ninotchka wearing her new hat timidly as well as a completely new outfit which she has bought apparently to match the new hat
it takes leon a few seconds to digest her new splendor
he takes her hand and leads her in closing the door
he looks at her again and kisses her hand
i dont look too foolish
if this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself i would follow it from one end of paris to the other and when i caught up with
it i would say just a moment you charming little dress i want you to meet ninotchka
you two were meant for each other
ninotchka feels more comfortable
leon leads her into the living room
they both enter
ninotchka pauses a second and looks around
you remember this room
ive never been here before
i wonder whom youre thinking of
oh i know a girl with a map figuring out each step worrying about north and south
now this might shock you
i went up to a taxi and said eight rue du bois
and here i am
life can be so simple
for twelve francs seventy five
twelve seventy five from the clarence
the son of a gun made a detour
charmingly but he got you here
at this moment the clock starts to strike
they both look toward it
the hands register nine oclock
leon wants to take her in his arms
she resists a little
reprimanding him its nine oclock
thats when one half of paris says to the other half what are your plans for this evening madame
getting more and more in the spirit of her change of appearance well first i should like to take off my hat and jacket
leon takes them then could we have some music
a wonderful idea
radio or records
lets have music thats just for ourselves
leon turns on the victrola
with great feeling and sincerity ill play it softly because i have things to tell you about which i cant shout
he walks back to ninotchka who by now is seated in an armchair
he sits on the arm of the chair
he tries to make a declaration of his love
he stammers several words
well my darling
it is no use
in a sudden outburst of emotion he takes her in his arms and kisses her
as they come out of the kiss you see i couldnt shout that
with great feeling leon you know the jokes you told me a few days ago
i wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them
now leon thats wrong
i know theyre not funny theyre silly
and when i look at buljanoff and iranoff and kopalski i know they are scoundrels and i should hate them then i realize who made them like that and instead
of sending my report to moscow i tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat
and if this keeps on
am i too talkative
leon i want to tell you something which i thought i never would say which i thought nobody ever should say because i thought it didnt exist
i cant say it
they kiss again
as the kiss ends they look at each other for a second
ninotchka gets up and goes toward the desk sits in the desk chair opens her handbag which lies there and takes from it a little mirror and a lipstick
before she uses it she looks at leon with guilty happiness
leon looks at her with great tenderness and walks over to the desk and stands looking at her as she makes up her lips
what a gesture for a sergeant
as soon as she is finished ninotchka slips the mirror and lipstick back into her handbag and as she does so glances at the top of the desk
leon i would like to ask you something
if you dont want to answer you neednt
but if you do you must tell me the truth
seriously did you make any change in this room
i dont think so
when i was here before i noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame
i thought what a waste of silver
thats all that interested me then
now i would like to know
what happened to the woman
leon too is completely serious by now
for answer he quietly opens the drawer of the desk
ninotchka looks in and takes from the drawer the photograph
as she looks at it she rises
leon nods gravely
looking at the picture she is very attractive
she has great elegance
she looks back at leon shes what you call a woman of the world isnt she
after a little pause ninotchka i love you
i suppose she is very entertaining
it must be lots of fun to be with her so witty so glamorous
ninotchka youre jealous
ninotchka nods sadly
with great feeling leon dont ever ask me for a picture of myself
i couldnt bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer
i couldnt breathe i couldnt stand it
as he takes her in his arms we duchess swana enters with a party consisting of general savitzky and five other smartly dressed people of the world
the headwaiter hurries to greet swana
good evening your highness
good evening louis
you seem to be very crowded tonight
can you manage a table near the floor
certainly your highness this way please
count dalgout made the reservation this afternoon
puzzled count dalgout
it is only a small table but it will be no trouble to put in some extra chairs
swana has grasped the situation by now
no thats another party
in order to save the situation one of the ladies makes a suggestion
why dont we go some other place
its so crowded here
delighted at her luck no no
this is glory
at last im going to have a look at that female bolshevik
can you give us another table
only one in the rear im afraid
camera moves with the group as the headwaiter leads it toward a table
you mean leons bringing the bolshevik you told us about
isnt it divine
i wouldnt have missed this for the world
very gay in anticipation of a triumph now we must be very discreet
if she sucks her soup and drinks out of her finger bowl i dont want anyone to laugh
everybody in the party giggles we must not embarrass little leon
he is going through enough for my sake
we mustnt add insult to injury by now they have reached the table in the rear
is this satisfactory
thank you louis
they sit down
the headwaiter bends over general savitzky an elderly russian aristocrat who sits next to swana
is it to be dinner monsieur
well just start with champagne
to the party im only afraid that the doorman may spoil our fun
if only he lets her in
swana laughs and everyone joins in her laughter
yes general savitzky
i want you to know all the white russian exiles in paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels
they are very interested in the case
swana suspects her countrymen
are they indeed
they hope the settlement will bring you a fortune
if you hear any rumors that i am a charitable person will you please kill them at their source
as she is lighting a cigarette a guest suddenly looks toward the entrance and sees leon
joyfully swana looks toward the entrance as does everyone else at the table
suddenly through the door of the cloakroom comes ninotchka radiant in a beautiful evening gown
swanas expression freezes as she sees ninotchka
the rest of the guests stare in an embarrassed silence save for one bird brained little guest named marianne who feels it her mission to save the situation
isnt she something
a neighbor nudges her warningly
swana withers her with a glance and rises
shall we dance general savitzky
swana and the general leave for the dance floor
the guest who has nudged her turns to marianne
are you crazy
how could you make such a remark
swana isnt stupid
what did i say
i just said isnt she something
i didnt say something what
leon and ninotchka are seated and a waiter stands by them presenting a bottle of champagne to leon for his approval
to waiter is it dry
to ninotchka is that right or do you prefer it sweet
i wouldnt know
the closest i ever came to champagne was in a newsreel
the wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship
its always good luck to launch something with champagne a battleship
or an evening
by now the waiter is filling their glasses
ninotchka lifts her glass and looks at it
its funny to look back
i was brought up on goats milk i had a ration of vodka in the army and now champagne
gaily from goats to grapes
thats drinking in the right direction
ninotchka takes her first sip of champagne
leon drinks and watches her
the first sip proves a painful surprise
ninotchkas face is that of a child who has been fed a bad medicine
slowly the delight of champagne dawns on her and her face breaks into a smile its good
she drinks the whole glass at once
leon looks at her in amused surprise
he drinks too
the waiter fills their glasses again
from what i read i thought champagne was a strong drink
its very delicate
do people ever get drunk on this
there have been cases
but the headache the next morning is worth while if you drink it with the right toast
he raises his glass again fondly to us ninotchka
they clink glasses and drink again looking at each other
long shot of the table including part of the dance floor
as leon and ninotchka lift their glasses again swana and general savitzky start to dance by the table
swana stops pretending complete astonishment
what a surprise
you of all people
how are you my dear
leon gets up
ninotchka watches the scene tensely
embarrassed hello swana
how do you do general savitzky
how do you do
to leon youre looking magnificent leon
to general savitzky isnt he general savitzky
leon knows that swana wants to embarrass him but is embarrassed nevertheless
is this your new dress suit
didnt i tell you benson and benson were the tailors for you
patiently yes swana you did
its a dream of beauty
he never takes my word for anything but i was right wasnt i
forcing an introduction am i interrupting
not at all
your highness may i present madame yakushova
how do you do
how do you do
and general savitzky
how do you do
how do you do
ive some wonderful news for you leon
its about punchy
do you mind if i sit down
realizing that he cannot prevent it no
swana sits down
to general savitzky general would you mind making my excuses at our table
ill be back in a few moments
he bows and leaves
well leon we can be proud of our punchy
he had a triumph at the dog show
during the following speech ninotchkas expression does not change
she knows exactly the game swana is playing
continuing he won another blue ribbon and bit the judge
i bought him the cutest sweater as a reward
you should see him strut down the street in it
he looks like a little boulevardier
to ninotchka you see count dalgout gave me punchy for my birthday
to leon you must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as punchy didnt you leon
fed up with swanas tactics months swana
to ninotchka poor madame yakushova
here we are talking in mysteries
im sure you wonder what its all about
dry and direct not at all
i understand perfectly count dalgout gave you a dog
you made it very clear madame
i must be losing my finesse
if im not careful ill be understood by everybody
acutely uncomfortable theres a charming crowd here tonight isnt there
im going leon
she rises as does leon delighted to get rid of her but before i leave i must compliment you on your gown madame yakushova
is that what theyre wearing in moscow this year
no last year madame
swana sits again as does leon
isnt it amazing
one gets a wrong impression of the new russia
cynically it must be charming
im glad conditions are so improved
i assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances
you see it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low cut gowns in the old russia
the lashes of the cossacks across our backs were not very becoming and you know how vain women are
youre absolutely right about the cossacks
we made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts
they had such reliable guns
leon has grown more and more uncomfortable as the two ladies fence
will you do me a favor
stop talking about the good old days
a very wise suggestion leon
im afraid madame and i will never agree
she plays her trump card the only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week
i understand everything will be over by thursday
am i right
ninotchka and leon realize the malice and yet the truth of her words
youre right madame it will all be over by thursday
rubbing it in it is unfortunate that you have so few more days in paris
she turns to leon be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to moscow
she rises leon rising too good night
ninotchka nods without answering
to leon good night leon
coldly good night swana
swana leaves the table
leon sits again
the mood of the two has been changed by the problem of their separation which has been brought before them
they sit in silence for a moment
ninotchka speaks first
now i think i need a glass of champagne
leon fills their glasses
then leon takes ninotchkas hand
trying to break the mood quickly please
tell me one of your funny stories
a funny story
you never finished the one about the two scotchmen with the names
well there were two scotchmen
one was named mcintosh and one was named mcgillicuddy
they met on the street
ill tell you another story a much better one
with deep sincerity the only thing that will be over on thursday is the lawsuit
there will be no thursday for us
not next week or any week
we wont let it happen
ill tear it out of the calendar
is that a good story
touched wonderful if one could believe it
you must darling
lifting her glass to the loveliest story i ever heard
the orchestra starts a number
afraid of where the conversation may lead shall we dance
they both start toward the dance floor
at the second turn ninotchka starts to feel the effect of the champagne
something is the matter
you just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast
oh everything is so wonderful
its getting farther and farther away
everything will be all right
in the gayest mood ninotchka addresses the crowd on the dance floor
embarrassed darling darling
i must talk to my brothers
dont shush me
i am people
i want to make a speech
i want to overthrow the duchess
leon starts to lead her off the dance floor
but darling you cant do that
good people of france
they are all duchesses here
thousands of duchesses
and i am going to tell them
by now they have almost reached the powder room
yes yes yes but first youre going in that door and youre going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down
sweetly no speech
as though he were addressing a little child no speech
i love you my little leonitchka
and i adore you ninotchua
ninotchka goes unsteadily into the powder room
leon wipes his forehead in relief and goes to the bar followed by the to the bartender give me a double brandy
a group of four to six women come out whispering excitedly about something which must have happened within
camera goes with them as they go to the manager of the restaurant and crowd about him and whisper what has happened
the bartender gives leon his double brandy and leon tosses it off
the manager comes into the shot and addresses leon
very excitedly im very sorry count dalgout it is most embarrassing but the lady you brought with you tonight is spreading communistic propaganda in the powder room
leon stares at him for a second then turns to the bartender
give me another double brandy
that kind of propaganda is bad anywhere but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike
well if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous
what can i do about it
she has been asked to leave the powder room but without success
we would appreciate if you would see to it yourself
horrified you want me to go in there
im sorry sir but i must insist
the manager bows and walks away
leon gulps down the second double brandy
the camera follows him as he proceeds toward the powder room like a hero going into battle
just as he is about to enter a very dignified elderly lady comes out is surprised at his attempted entrance and glares at him
leon loses his courage and followed by the camera goes back to the bar to strengthen it with some of the dutch variety
completely exhausted to the bartender make it a triple brandy
as we rakonin the waiter opens the door
ninotchka and leon both very tipsy by now enter the room
leon is carrying a bottle of champagne in a napkin
as he passes the waiter he speaks to rakonin all right
you can tell the duchess
you can tell everybody
they know anyhow
it doesnt make any difference
now get out
rakonin who seems very interested in the situation closes the door
leon goes to ninotchka
both sit on a couch
moving close to him dont tell them where were going sweetheart
nobody will find us
ninotchka is lyrically tight
through her there shines a great happiness
are we going to build our little house
a little white house
not white darling
all right well make it red
no dont lets have it any color
just a house house
lets form our own party
right lovers of the world unite
delighted and we wont stretch up our arms
and we wont clench our fist
tenderly our salute will be a kiss
she sinks into his arms and they kiss
still in his arms i am so happy
no one can be so happy without being punished
i will be punished and i should be punished
she gets up i want to confess darling
its the russian soul
her gaiety mixed with sadness everyone wants to confess and if they dont confess they make them confess
i am a traitor
when i kissed you i betrayed the russian ideal
leon i should be stood up against the wall
leon gets up
sympathetically would that make you any happier
still carrying the champagne bottle leon leads her to the end of the room and stands her against the wall
he takes the napkin from the champagne bottle and puts it over her eyes
the camera moves with him as he goes away from ninotchka and as he walks he starts to open the champagne
the cork pops
close shot ninotchka as she sinks gently into a chair
happily i have paid the penalty
now lets have some music
lets turn on the radio
what is radio
its a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model
getting up oh yes yes
it has a little knob that turns
a little knob
it must be somewhere around here
confusedly ninotchka starts looking for something repeating a little knob
a little knob
followed by leon she goes toward the safe opens the concealing door and both are delighted as they see the safes dial
triumphantly here it is
leon nods approval and starts to turn the dial
what shall we get
no no news
we dont want to know whats happening in the world
we want to be left alone dont we
all by ourselves
remembering vaguely well then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven
leon follows her instructions
after a little pause sadly its dead
well it has to warm up
you have to give it a chance
just like people
like you and me
first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party
he takes her in his arms and again they embrace
as though she were in heaven now twice to the left and stop at seventeen
leon again follows her instructions
interior safe shooting toward the door
leon opens the door and both look into the safe
disappointed no music
also disappointed no no music
through her fog ninotchka becomes aware of the case containing the jewels
bitterly there it is
you cant rip it out of the week
helpfully but i can throw it out of the window
philosophically it wouldnt be fair to the man in the street
she pushes back the lid there they are
they are terrible things those jewels
they are the tears of old russia
see that stone
who cried that one
czar peter gave it to his wife catherine the great
for it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market
now darling dont get impatient wait until we are married
you know that worthless butler of mine
some day when i come home to you i may say darling i drove gaston to the market and look what i got from him
from the case of jewels he takes a beautiful diadem and holds it in front of her
the economist now first ten thousand serfs
now just gaston
it is very encouraging
leon takes her by the hand and leads her from the safe
let me put it on you
you will teach these jewels
for the first time they will learn how they can look
they belong to the people
in a ceremonial voice i give them back to the people
as formal and steady as possible under the conditions he puts the diadem on her head i make you ninotchka the great
duchess of the people
grand duchess of the people
ninotchka falls in with the spirit of this imaginary coronation
is this the wish of the masses
it is their wish
thank you leon
thank you masses
in a low voice can i make a speech now
ninotchka turns to an imaginary assemblage
people of the world
the revolution is on the march
wars will wash over us
bombs will fall
all civilization will crumble
but not yet please
whats the hurry
mixing reality with fantasy let us be happy
give us our moment
turning to leon we are happy arent we leon
fondly yes sweetheart
he holds her in his arms her voice getting dimmer and dimmer so happy and so tired
she falls asleep in his arms
leon gathers her up and carries her into the bedroom the diadem still on her head
leon carries ninotchka to the bed puts her down on it
she is now sleeping soundly
he kisses her once more and then turns the camera panning with him and starts toward the door to the corridor and exits
as he closes the door with an uncertain hand it slams
close shot ninotchka as she lies on the bed on the night table beside her is a photograph of the stern faced lenin
the crash of the slamming door awakens ninotchka for a moment
completely content and happy she turns around and sees the disapproving face of the photograph
charmingly smile little father smile
the photograph of lenin starts to smile in approval as we
in the foreground a clock shows that it is a quarter to twelve
it is taken from an angle which includes the door
the lights are still on the curtains drawn the empty champagne bottle and glasses litter the room
we hear the buzzer of the corridor door ring several times without an answer
camera moves through the door into the bedroom never disclosing the bed
the lights in the bedroom are still lighted also and the curtains drawn
camera stops on the door from the bedroom to the corridor
the buzzer rings
apparently the caller has moved from the living room door to the bedroom door
ninotchka is lying on the bed still in her evening dress
the diadem is no longer on her head but no special emphasis is laid on that detail in the camera angle
we hear the sound of the buzzer ringing again and again
ninotchka half wakens and calls out something which sounds like come in without being fully aware of what she is doing
the door is opened from the outside by a maid who lets in the duchess swana dressed in a smart morning outfit
swana looks around surprised and amused at the state of the room
she walks over to the bed where lies ninotchka still not enough awake to face reality
swana is delighted to have surprised ninotchka in this condition
ironically good morning
awakening gradually what
it is tomorrow morning
tomorrow noon to be exact
i hope you will forgive me
i know its extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour
dont you recognize me
i am the duchess swana
by now ninotchka is awake
she gets up and realizes to her acute embarrassment the condition in which swana has found her
i know how you feel my dear
the morning after always does look grim if you happen to be wearing last nights dress
dont be embarrassed by my presence though
you couldnt have found anybody more sympathetic to your condition
i remember once in petrograd when i felt exactly as you do
i had to bow from a balcony to the crowd
my dear the masses have no understanding of the feelings of a lady before noon
dont you find that true
during swanas speech ninotchka has found herself completely
i think we can cut your visit short
leon is not here
of course not my dear
i didnt come here with any such suspicion
with a glance toward the living room nor did i come here to pick up his hat
close shot leons hat shot through the bedroom door into the living room where it lies on the table
by the bed stand ninotchka and swana
swana starts toward the living room ninotchka following her
as she reaches the threshold how stale last nights gaiety looks
it has the taste of a dead cigarette
if you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night i am afraid you misunderstood my attitude
dont worry you were quite rude enough
during the following speech she draws the curtains and opens the windows do you mind if i let in a little fresh air and sunshine
im sure it will make you feel better and i want you to be at your very best
in full possession of your faculties at least
regaining her usual firmness please come to the point
what is it you want
i just dropped in to have a little heart to heart talk with you
we have nothing to discuss
now there you are completely wrong
if we sit down for a little chat im sure we wont run out of conversation and whats more it wont be dull
madame what is it you people always say regardless of what you mean
i am delighted to have you here
i have not reached that stage of civilization
thats all right
i grow on people
i must ask you to leave
thats exactly what i came here to ask you to do
i dont mean this hotel and i dont mean paris
i mean france
theres a plane for moscow at five forty
puzzled madame if you
i have already made reservations
its perfect flying weather
they assure me theres a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to moscow in no time
still not understanding if this is meant to be a joke it is not funny
or do you still think youre issuing orders from your palace in petrograd
ninotchkas words for the first time sting swana out of her apparently superficial attitude
bitterly my palace in petrograd
yes you took that away from me
you took away my czar my country my people everything i had
with emphasis but nothing more i warn you
simply people cannot be taken away madame neither a hundred and sixty million nor one
not if you have their love
thats why youre not in russia any longer and thats why you came here this morning
very interesting my dear but couldnt you write all that from moscow
a dissertation on love on soviet stationery would be an amusing paradox
it is not enough to be witty madame
people grow tired of being entertained
you made that mistake before
problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony
my dear you dont know how impressive i could be
did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels
the word diadem startles ninotchka
she starts to remember the night before and she looks toward the safe
insert of the door of the safe which is closed by now
ninotchka stares in the direction of the safe as swana chatters on
you cant deny we gave the people their moneys worth almost eight tumbling romanoffs eight
desperately i must insist that you leave
not before you agree to use those reservations to moscow
in that case i can only say good by
abruptly she walks toward the bedroom
she enters the small room connecting the living room and bedroom and closes the door to the living room
she walks into the bedroom toward the bed and glances at it
the diadem is not there
after going back into the anteroom she opens the outer door of the safe and pulls on the inner door
it has not been properly closed and opens at once
the safe is empty
ninotchka stands staring in frozen horror for a moment then rushes to the telephone by the bed
into the telephone elysee
long shot ninotchka at the telephone waiting for her connection in the background the door to the living room is opened by swana
standing in the door i wouldnt waken leon
after last night i would say not before three oclock at the earliest
i told you to go madame
believe me leon cant help you
he doesnt know anything about the jewels
i give you my word
i swear it
ninotchka hangs up the receiver and stares at swana
she walks toward her
living room shooting into the bedroom
in the foreground swana in the background ninotchka who is hurrying toward her
where are they
you were very careless with our precious jewels my dear
theyre too expensive a toy for two children to play with
where are they
fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open
perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a russian
she draws back the fur scarf she is wearing revealing a diamond star one of the jewels we have seen i just put this on for sentiment
the rest are absolutely safe
i assure you
but if you feel like notifying the police
you leave me no choice
wont it be rather embarrassing for a soviet envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them
i will have to face the consequences but so will you
dont forget they will ask how you got them
thats very simple to answer
they were given to me by my mother
they were given to her by her mother in fact theyre mine you cannot steal what belongs to you
she proceeds into the living room followed by ninotchka
they always belonged to the russian people
they were paid for with their sweat their blood their lives and you will give them back
triumphantly i told you we had plenty to talk about
shall we sit down
they both sit
very matter of fact now lets free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way
our situation has changed considerably
before i had only a claim to the jewels
now i have the jewels
in other words moral ideas have no weight with you
all right then lets deal with legal facts
you know that france has recognized the soviet
under soviet law the jewels belong to the state
france is going to uphold that ownership
my lawyer agrees with you
he says france will uphold it in every court but i will drag you through every court dont forget that
and when i say it will take two years i am as always conservative
wont those two years in court be expensive for you
i know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people but now
i may run out of money but you have already run out of bread
two years is a long time for your comrades to wait
you have calculated in terms of hunger
no i just wanted to be absolutely impartial
both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years
we can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition
ninotchka now realizes what she is after
i am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five forty plane to moscow
quietly thats not the way to win him back
i think i know leon quite as well as you
possibly a little better
leave that worry to me
five forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with monsieur mercier but naturally youll be too busy for any farewells
ill see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and i will also see you to the airport
thats my proposition comrade yakushova
ninotchka knows herself to be faced with an inevitable decision
for a moment she cannot answer
the telephone rings
ninotchka takes the receiver
into telephone yes
it is leon oh hello
much as she wants to talk to him she hesitates in the presence of swana
swana realizes the situation gets up and walks over to the window where she stands looking out
good morning leon
forcing herself to be gay so that he will not suspect anything no you didnt waken me
i am fine thank you
yes it was
im afraid i cant
i am going to be very busy
looking for excuses well i have a lot of things to attend to today
well to tell you the truth i am a little tired and i would like to rest
she forces herself to laugh you may be right
perhaps it is the champagne
seven oclock here
realizing that she will be gone by then seven oclock is all right
that will be lovely
there is a knock on the door come in
into the telephone yes
looking toward the door she sees something which makes her stop the conversation just a moment
she puts the receiver on the table and walks toward the door anteroom between living room and corridor shooting toward the living room
in the background we see swana standing at the window
ninotchka comes into the anteroom closes the door in order to shut off swanas view
camera pans with ninotchka as she walks toward the hall door where the bellboy is putting down a big flower basket
to bellboy you can leave it here
the bellboy exits
ninotchka looks at the basket of flowers for a moment then takes the envelope which is attached to the handle
she opens it and reads the enclosed letter
it must be a love note for her eyes grow wet
she turns to the last page
and sweetheart i have kept my first promise
i sent poor old gaston to the market this morning and if you will look deep into the flowers you will see what i got for him
she puts her hand in the basket and takes out a bottle of milk
on the label we see a picture of a goat
she smiles sadly and goes to the telephone which is on the console in the anteroom
into telephone operator will you switch the call please
darling your present just arrived
its very silly and very wonderful
no i wont forget
with great tenderness good by my darling
she puts down the receiver
camera pans with her as she goes to the door of the living room
she opens the door and goes in
swana turns from the window
i am sorry to have kept you waiting madame
shooting from a high angle
we hear the sound of an airplane just taking off
camera pulls back so that swana seems to be photographed from the airplane
finally the shot discloses the whole airport and swana disappearing into the crowd
swanas maid is opening the door for swana who enters in the highest spirits
good afternoon jacqueline
good afternoon your highness
hesitantly madame i
you didnt find my glove
all right youre forgiven
thank you your highness
count dalgout is waiting
hes been here some time
swana inspects herself briefly in the hall mirror proceeds into the living room
leon is pacing up and down
leon darling how nice
have you ordered tea or a cocktail
no thanks swana
did i act stupidly last night
should i apologize
im the one who should apologize
i should have talked to you before
is this by any chance going to be a confession
oh no my little volga boatman
have you forgotten our first commandment never complain never explain
it has worked so often and so perfectly dont lets break the rule
and please dont look so guilty otherwise ill
this time swana just this once i must ask you to listen
all right ill listen
i know you hate the obvious but do you mind if at this moment im not in the least subtle
brutal frankness if you insist
there are a hundred ways to approach it but i feel it can best be said in one simple phrase
im in love swana
and i thought it was something serious
how could you frighten me so
it must be serious swana
not long ago id have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class
now i can say it without stammering without a blush
im in love swana
say it over and over again leon
words are a wonderful safety valve and thats what you need because you know its impossible dont you
i have to be simple again swana and you may find it shockingly banal
ive thought it over and im willing to take all the consequences even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living
this has the ugly sound of regeneration
im afraid thats what it is
the same old trouble leon
youre always late
whether youre taking me to the opera or calling for me at a beauty shop youre never on time
and now when its a question of your reform late again
she glances at her wrist watch by about five minutes
what is this swana
knowing the efficiency of the french air service i think i can guarantee that madame yakushova has already taken off for moscow
has done what
shes gone leon
do you expect me to believe that
swana picks up the receiver of the telephone and holds it out to him
heres the telephone
if you call the hotel you will find that you have no seven oclock appointment
it is flying past the eiffel tower
behind the window we see ninotchka looking at paris for the last time
camera moves over to the next window and we see buljanoff iranoff and kopalski also giving paris a sad farewell look
another view of paris from the air
the mist has closed in by now so that only the top of the eiffel tower is visible above it
close up ninotchka looking down on the tower interior airplane ninotchka buljanoff iranoff and kopalski ninotchka turns from the window and leans against the back of her chair
the russians follow her example
there is a moment of silence and sadness
imagine for once in our lives we were in paris and we never went to the eiffel tower
they tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor
while you eat you look at the view
she is trying to overcome all sentimentality but as the following speech progresses she cannot escape the personal implication involved
yes it is an amazing piece of engineering
still the most remarkable iron structure in the world
leading to the top there is a staircase of over a thousand steps
but an elevator is included in the price of admission
camera zooms down on a headline of an article
mercier buys priceless russian jewels
russian commission has left for moscow
camera follows leon as he walks excitedly and nervously along the boulevard
he turns into a russian intouriste bureau one of the travel bureaus maintained by the soviet government in foreign countries to supply information regarding travel give visas etc
it is a typical travel bureau
behind the counter are attendants and some people getting information and pamphlets
leon enters looks around and sees a door which says visas and passport department
it is a room smaller than the previous one
behind the counter stands a typical bolshevik official
in front of the counter is an elderly english lady
leon takes his place behind her nervous at having to wait
the official stamps the english ladys passport and hands it to her
well everything is in order
i hope you will enjoy your trip to russia madame
oh by the way ive heard so many rumors about laundry conditions in russia
is it advisable to take ones own towels
certainly not madame
thats only capitalistic propaganda
we change the towel every week
leon moves up to the official
at this moment the telephone rings
the official takes the receiver
into phone yes
no im sorry
he hasnt been with us for six months
he was called back to russia and was investigated
you can get further details from his widow
he hangs up the receiver
leon thinking of ninotchka is horrified by this statement
pardon me i am very interested in what you just said you mean when an envoy goes back to russia if they dont like what he has done they put
him out of the way
look at me
ive been back twice
he knocks on wood his alarm growing heres my passport
please give me a visa
i have to leave for russia immediately
reading passport count leon dalgout
dont hold that against me
why should an aristocrat want to go to russia
there is no privacy in russia
this whole thing seems very suspicious
whats the real reason
if you ever want to get into russia take my advice
dismayed confess what
are you sympathetic to the former czaristic government the white russians
on the contrary i dont want to have anything to do with them
you believe in our cause
leon feeling that he has to go to the rescue of his girl whips up an enormous enthusiasm for the cause
i think its great
everyone works everyone contributes thats what i want to do work
i make my own bed you can call up my butler
i dont believe in the right of the individual
i like the bolshevik ideal everyone being the same
you just like me me just like you i use your comb you use my toothbrush oh its a great life
give me that visa
at this moment swana enters
hello leon darling
suavely after our talk last night i took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning
knowing how difficult it is to get into soviet russia i thought i might be of some assistance to you
to the official may i introduce myself
i am the duchess swana of russia
the official gasps in surprise
now please swana
to the official count dalgout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him ill be delighted
bitterly that does it swana
he leads her toward the door now you mustnt miss your appointment with your hair dresser
stopping at the door just in case they dont give you your visa to russia i want you to know that i have signed a contract for my memoirs and
rented a lovely little chateau in the touraine and if you feel the need of a change
thank you swana
you are very gracious
his words are unmistakably a final dismissal
she walks out
leon looks after her for a second then goes back to the official
he tries to laugh off the incident
she must have her little joke
the official responds with a stony look youre not going to take that seriously
the grand duchess swana
active in the white russian movement
believe me i have no connection with her any longer
i swear i havent
but you had
listen i want to be absolutely frank with you
i have no business in moscow
i think so too
i want to see a friend of mine
a very dear friend
its a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies
its a girl
so its love which drags you to moscow
fighting for his point i must get into that country of yours
more aggressively thats impossible
nobody has the right
you cant do that
if you dont give me that visa
ironically youre going to force us
growing violent now look here
you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in you keep him out
why should i take a chance
how do i know you dont want to blow up a factory
or a tunnel or a bridge
nothing but suspicions
thats the trouble with you
if you dont let me in ill stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from russia
ill picket your whole country
the official laughs in a superior way
ill boycott you thats what im going to do
no more vodka
no more caviar
no more tchaikovsky
no more borscht
wait a minute i know something better than that
the official leans forward sarcastically
with a knock out blow leon sends him to the floor then leaning over the counter he shouts
and you can tell the kremlin thats just the beginning
he strides out
the officials head emerges from the counter
as he adjusts his bruised jaw he speaks
establishing shot of russia first of may stock shot of may day parade on the red square march march march
comrades of the world never has there been such a may day parade as this
already for four hours the pavements of moscow have resounded to the tread of a million boots
thousands of gun carriages have thundered past
thousands of tanks combined with our mighty air force have demonstrated to a belligerent neighbor that we are ready and invincible
now past me marches the great army of our civilians
men and women of all ages
all servants of the state united in one thought and ideal
group of several units marching workmen soldiers tanks airplanes etc
column of women dressed in typical russian may day parade fashion marching and saluting
the camera narrows down to a close shot of ninotchka marching with the others
all her individuality is gone
she is one of many a cog in the russian machine
with a stern expression she is looking straight ahead when suddenly something attracts her attention and she glances to one side
a column of male workers is coming in the opposite direction
buljanoff iranoff and kopalski are recognizable among them
close shot buljanoff iranoff and kopalski marching
all three are already pretty exhausted from the long march
kopalski sees ninotchka
he whispers it to the others
the three look toward ninotchka and lift their shoulders with a gesture which says look where we are now
close shot ninotchka answering them with a sad smile
after they have passed she stares straight forward again with the same stern expression
it is an overcrowded house
people are walking up and down stairs standing grouped in front of the various apartments children are sliding down the banisters and playing games under the feet of the adults
ninotchka trudges upstairs wearily
camera pans with her as she goes into an apartment which is divided into several sub apartments
finally she opens the door of her own room and goes in
it is a comparatively small room which she shares with two other girls
as she enters only one girl is present
it is anna a cello player who sits on the edge of her bed practicing on her cello
apparently ninotchka has not adjusted herself completely to the moscow which she once thought so great
good evening anna
good evening ninotchka
arent you late
no the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade
during the following scene anna puts her cello in its case and gets ready to go to her job
ninotchka starts to arrange the table in the center of the floor for a party of four
out of her cupboard she takes very primitive looking dishes a flower pot glasses and a kind of shawl which serves as a tablecloth
didnt you march
anna is apparently not a fanatical believer in the bolshevik regime and takes a cynical and humorous attitude toward it
they didnt let me
i am in disgrace
last week at the performance of carmen i played a sour note
the conductor got so excited he yelled theres sabotage in the string section
you missed an inspiring day anna
my heart is sad
but my feet are happy
when all the tanks and guns were roaring over the red square i sat here all by myself and played a beethoven sonata
not bad at all
she has noticed ninotchkas preparations are you expecting someone
a few friends
just a little dinner party
what are you serving
puzzled an omelet
arent you living a little above your ration
well ive saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so well manage
it just goes to prove the theory of our state
if you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if youre true to the collective spirit and stick together youve got an omelet
devilishly that reminds me
have you heard the latest theyre telling about the kremlin
at this moment a door to one of the adjoining rooms opens and gurganov a middle aged man with a sour stool pigeon expression walks quietly through the room to
another door taking in the girls with one sly glance and giving the impression that not only his eyes but his ears are open
anna breaks off her remark
whispering ill tell you later
after gurganov has disappeared into the other room she continues that gurganov you never know whether hes on his way to the washroom or the secret police
you should be more careful anna
and you too ninotchka
amazed about what
ever since you have been back from paris
i havent talked to anyone about paris
i havent said a word
thats just it
it makes people feel queer
i dont want you to get in any trouble
i have nothing to hide
ill show you
she walks over to her cupboard and takes out a piece of lingerie and comes back to ninotchka with it
when i passed through the laundry yard today i saw all the women huddled around this so i brought it up here
things like this create a bad feeling
first they didnt know whose it was
then they saw the paris label and did it start a commotion
some said its what we all ought to wear and others said its like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline
it undermines our whole cause
aware of the pettiness which surrounds her i see
you know how it is today
all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter revolution
thank you anna
ill dry it up here when i wash it next
i should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear
confidentially ninotchka you know i am your friend you can trust me
did you bring back anything else
ninotchka suddenly is transported to paris in her memory
with feeling no i left everything in paris
i just happened to be wearing this
what else did you have
enjoying the thought well a hat
what was it like
it was very silly
i would be ashamed to wear it here
as beautiful as that
come tell me
an evening gown
puzzled evening gown
a dress you wear in the evening
what do you wear in the morning
when you get up you put on a negligee and then you change to a morning frock
you mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day
now ninotchka youre exaggerating
no my dear it is true
thats how they live in the other world
here we dress to have our bodies covered
to keep warm
well sometimes theyre not completely covered but
they dont freeze
fingering the piece of lingerie they must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft
something you dont even see
you feel it though
hesitantly ninotchka i wouldnt bring this up if we werent such good friends
what is it anna
you know i told you that pavlov and i are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers
would it be asking too much
you want this
just for the honeymoon
you can have it for good
it is my wedding present
anna is for a moment speechless over this generous gift
she embraces and kisses ninotchka
she kisses her again takes her cello and starts to leave
am i going to play that cadenza tonight
anna exits closing the door
ninotchka is left alone
her thoughts are still in the other world obviously with leon
mechanically she looks over the table to see if everything is all right then she walks over to the radio a primitive little machine
as she turns the knob she smiles again reminiscently
as she does the blare of a russian speech brings her back to reality
yes as atoms in the cosmos of soviet russia
one great family of one hundred and sixty million struggling fighting victorious russian proletarians
thus shall we pursue our way into the future fists clenched hearts encased in steel armed against bourgeois sentimentality and
quickly she turns the knob and again there is a burst of russian oratory
from the exploiters for the toilers
we are going full steam ahead through industrialization toward socialism
let us put the union of socialistic soviet republics into an automobile and the muzhik into a tractor and then let the capitalists try to keep up with us
the same thing happens for a third time
and thirty million peasants eighty five per cent of the population owned three hundred forty three million four hundred and sixty nine thousand acres of land sixty five per cent
of the total area
and one hundred and fifty thousand nobles possessed thirty five per cent of the countrys natural wealth
ninotchka turns off the radio
she closes her eyes for a moment and with a sad smile murmurs to herself
at this moment the door opens and buljanoff iranoff and kopalski enter
there follow warm greetings between ninotchka and the three russians
a moment of silence follows
the four look at each other as people do who share a secret
with great warmth how are you you three scoundrels
wryly well were back home
sourly you know what they say theres nothing like home
and we might as well face it
trying not to say what she feels come now you must not talk that way
you have to adjust yourselves
we must be brave
lets be happy that were all alive
and thats something we owe to ninotchka
if you hadnt given commissar razinin such a wonderful report about us who knows what would have happened
i can tell you exactly
now lets forget everything except that were together
lets do that
falling in with her attempt its a real paris reunion
if you close your eyes and listen to our voices we might be in paris
lets not close our eyes
there are many good things to see here too
cynically i think i need my glasses
reprimanding him quietly a little more tact
look how nicely shes fixed the table all for us
in a loud voice trying to make up for his faux pas how nicely youve fixed the table ninotchka
what a lovely room you have here
how many families live here with you
only myself and two other girls
one is a cello player in the opera and the other a street car conductor
impressed just three people in a room this size
inspecting the room and your own gas cooker
forgetting himself naturally its not the royal suite
once and for all were in moscow
walking over to the window yes theres no doubt of that
sarcastically just look out of the window and there it is
and its great
think what it was a few years ago and what it is now
iranoff and buljanoff have joined them at the window
under his breath anyhow lets talk ourselves into it
just see how happy the people look
can you blame them
at least the may day parade is over
thats another thing
the same spring we had in paris
just as good
even the swallows are back
yes thats right
maybe thats the same swallow we saw in paris
it is ninotchka
he must have been in paris
you can see it in his whole attitude
he just picked up a crumb of our black bread shook his head and dropped it
if you asked him why he left france i bet he couldnt name one good reason
i should be a swallow
right now i would be sitting in front of the cafe de paris picking up flakes of french pastry that would melt in my bill
there is something better in life than crumbs of french pastry
the realist yes a good piece of apfel strudel
we will get that
well get everything
maybe a little bit later but well get it
we must be patient
finally we got the spring didnt we
we got the swallows and you will get your apfel strudel too
consolingly and if it is too late for you your children will eat it
breaking the mood lets forget the future
lets stop being sentimental
lets start that omelet
he takes a little box out of his pocket heres my egg
he hands it to ninotchka iranoff unties his egg from his handkerchief
and heres mine
he hands it to ninotchka
buljanoff reaches in his pocket and from his expression we see that a catastrophe must have happened
im out of the omelet
there will be enough
come ninotchka lets make it in real parisian style
the group all go to the gas cooker and ninotchka starts to make the omelet
the others stand around as though they were watching a great event
lets fill it with confitures des prunes
des raisins de madere des framboises
with grapes of madeira with raspberries
des petites fraises des bois
de la creme de bretagne
with small wild strawberries
so it blows up that big
what they call an omelette surprise
and the surprise is theres nothing in it
i know but if we cant put in all these wonderful things at least lets put in some imagination
he raises his voice in that one omelet well taste the whole of paris
the door through which gurganov disappeared opens and gurganov comes out
seeing him sssh
the conversation stops
gurganov walks quietly through the room again observing everything
he goes out at last
a man like that
all he has to do is to walk through a room and the omelet drops
there is a dead silence
all are again aware of the reality which surrounds
they concentrate quietly on the frying pan
the eggs are gradually taking the shape of an omelet
only the last scraps of the omelet are on it
buljanoffs hand comes in with a big piece of bread with which he sops up every fragment that is left
the curtains are drawn and the lamp lighted
all four are sitting around the table in the center of which is a samovar
in front of each of them is a glass of tea
one of the russians is playing a balalaika and all are singing gaily paris
ninotchka is enjoying their companionship
after a little while the door to the corridor opens and ninotchkas other roommate the street car conductor strides in
she is a squareset unfriendly woman in uniform
at sight of her one of the russians nudges ninotchka makes the gesture of ringing up a fare and accompanies it with an inquiring look
the russians change their tune quickly to the volga boatman in order not to awaken animosity
the street car conductor goes to her bed and starts to take off her shoes and her coat then draws the curtain
during the following scene we hear the splash of water and the sound of gargling
again gurganov crosses the room this time accompanied by his little son
suddenly the door is opened by vladimir a friendly old man
calling into the room comrade yakushova here the postman left a letter for you
he hands her a letter and exits
she takes the letter glances at the envelope and is stunned
she turns the envelope an expression of breathless wonder comes over her face
what is it ninotchka
its from paris
how is he
come tell us
how is he
ninotchka sits in the chair nearest the lamp
all three are looking over her shoulder
ninotchka hesitates to open the letter obviously wanting to read it all by herself
realizing her feelings the three russians walk to the far end of the room and sit down on a little bench looking toward ninotchka with childlike expectancy
in great anticipation ninotchka opens the letter
she starts to read it
suddenly her expression changes to one of terrific disappointment
she turns the letter over glances at the second page then puts the letter down on the table
the russians have followed her expression closely
slowly they walk over to her
very sympathetic bad news
look for yourselves
iranoff picks up the letter
all three look at it
insert of first page of letter held in iranoffs hand
in leons handwriting we read ninotchka my darling the rest of the writing is blocked out line by line and across the page is a big stamp which says censored
iranoffs hand turns the page
the second page is also censored except for the final words yours leon
iranoff puts the letter back on the table
they all understand and realize that ninotchka wants to be alone
well i think its getting late
good night ninotchka
thank you for a wonderful dinner
ninotchka rises and shakes their hands
with great warmth good night my friends
the three start to leave but buljanoff returns and whispers to ninotchka
they cant censor our memories can they
ninotchka presses his hand
he walks quietly out with the others
ninotchka left alone sits down
she is heartbroken
her thoughts are too sad and too far away to be disturbed by the snoring which comes from the corner where the street car conductor has gone to bed
shooting from the inside
through the window the background of moscow
it is winter and snow is on the roofs
the camera pulls back and discloses razinin sitting at his desk reading a report with a stern expression
ninotchka enters carrying several folders
she walks to razinins desk and stands waiting for him to recognize her presence
she is a tired stern girl
razinin looks up
good morning comrade
very businesslike good morning comrade commissar
here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months
does this include the products of the far eastern provinces
yes it does
you mean you have finished the whole investigation
you must have worked day and night
dont you ever sleep
i need very little sleep
we must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange
i have already started a survey of our most urgent needs
well comrade i am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else
startled may i ask why
well comrade have you heard from your friends kopalski buljanoff and iranoff
i havent either but ive heard about them
you must realize it was only on the strength of your paris report that i sent them to constantinople without that i never would have trusted them on a mission
as important as the fur deal
may i ask what has happened
as soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance
if i told you whats going on in constantinople right now you wouldnt believe it
those three have been sitting there for six weeks and havent sold a piece of fur
he points to the folder this anonymous report was sent me
they are dragging the good name of our country through every cafe and night club
he reads from the report how can the bolshevik cause gain respect among the moslems if your three representatives buljanoff iranoff and kopalski get so drunk that they throw a
carpet out of their hotel window and complain to the management that it didnt fly
ninotchka has to suppress a smile of amusement at the antics of her three old friends
oh they shouldnt do such things
are you sure this report is correct
it gives details which couldnt be invented
naturally i want to verify it and thats why i need you
apprehensively you want me to go to constantinople
her one object to escape the mission i appreciate the confidence you show in me but i must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission
i should hate to interrupt my present work
i am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne
austerely that is for me to decide comrade yakushova
i am sorry i dont want to overstep my position but please
dont send me
i dont understand
making a last effort how can i make myself clear
it is difficult to express but id rather not go to foreign countries any more
let me stay here
let me finish my work
i am in the rhythm of it now
i dont want to go away
i dont want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again
it throws one out of gear
let me finish my work
i have concentrated everything in it
dont make me go
please dont waste my time comrade
do your duty
i will do my best
she exits as we establishing shot of constantinople on a bright sunlit day if possible with the circling shadow of an airplane
long shot airport in constantinople shooting from an airplane angle
a crowd is awaiting the arrival of a plane
the camera goes down to a close shot of buljanoff iranoff and kopalski standing in the crowd
all three are very elegantly and gaily dressed
they are in the happiest mood
one of them carries a large bouquet of flowers to greet ninotchka
its style should suggest the locale
ninotchka enters with the three russians who are very happy to have her with them again
indicating the room how do you like it ninotchka
isnt it wonderful
ninotchka protests but during the whole scene it is evident that behind her protestations there is none of the force and conviction she displayed in a similar situation in the
but buljanoff iranoff kopalski
now please ninotchka dont start figuring it out in cows
youve done it again and i am responsible
how can you forget yourselves this way
you were sent here to make money not to spend it
buljanoff she still has those old fashioned bolshevik ideas
it is high time you got out of russia
not knowing what to do with the three rascals i must be stern with you
delighted thats our old ninotchka
agreeing with him yes yes
dont forget the day will come when you will have to face razinin
cockily good old razinin
is he still alive
how does he manage
with the happiness of being free again in his voice we are not comrades any more
we are friends ninotchka
imagine we dont have to whisper any longer
we can say whatever we want
we can shout
we can complain
he opens the door leading to corridor the service in this hotel is terrible
he closes the door see
nobody pays any attention
dryly no thats bad management
is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment
i must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account
dont ask for it ninotchka
there is a turkish proverb which says if something smells bad why put your nose in it
and there is a russian saying the cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses
with our cream situation what it is it is russia which should apologize to the cats
friends buljanoff iranoff
afraid of being left out and kopalski
pleadingly dont make it difficult for me
this is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you
that was our idea when we first came
all we thought we would get out of this trip was a turkish bath but
we learned better
ninotchka we are in the magic east the country of aladdin and his lamp
ali baba and the forty thieves
into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights
all you have to do is say open sesame
i dont know how i can get you out of it this time
how will it end
what will happen to you
intimately shall we tell her
proudly ninotchka i hope youll be our guest
we have opened a restaurant
we have a wonderful electric sign dine with buljanof iranoff and kopalski
you mean you are deserting russia
singing the song of freedom dont call it desertion
our little restaurant
that is our russia
the russia of borscht the russia of beef stroganoff blinis with sour cream
the russia of piroshki
people will eat and love it
we are not only serving good food we are serving our country
we are making friends
completely bewildered who gave you this idea
what is responsible for all this
with a gleam in his eye theres something in constantinople
it is in the air
it may come around the corner as you walk down the street
it may step out of a bazaar
it may wait for you in a corridor
it may hide in the shadow of a minaret
pointing to the balcony right now its on the balcony
ninotchka looks toward the balcony and is dumbfounded as she sees leon standing there smiling at her
he walks quietly toward her
looking longingly at ninotchka they wouldnt let me in so i had to get you out
still taken aback so youre behind all this
i should have known
leon takes her hand and kisses it
the three russians exchange glances
the camera pans with them leaving ninotchka and leon as russians walk discreetly out of the room and close the door behind them
trying to keep me away from you
it couldnt be done
naturally i couldnt go on forever punching passport officials in the nose but i found a way didnt i
darling i had to see you
i wrote and wrote but all my letters came back
the one i got they wouldnt let me read
carried away by emotion it began ninotchka my darling and ended yours leon
with great feeling and sincerity i wont tell you what came between
ill prove it
it will take a long time ninotchka
at least a lifetime
ninotchka is aware that she is facing a decision
she knows what she wants but still tries to evade a definite answer
but leon i am only here for a few days
if you dont stay with me ill have to continue my fight
ill travel wherever russian commissions are
ill turn them all into buljanoffs iranoffs and kopalskis
the world will be crowded with russian restaurants
ill depopulate russia
once you saved your country by going back
this time you can save it by staying here
well when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country how can i waver
no one shall say ninotchka was a bad russian
