written by don roos march some microphone feedback followed by okay here we go
our screen goes white as a powerpoint presentation begins
id like to tell you all a little lov e story
but the images n screen are journalistic photos of whoops
and we begin pulling back to reveal the lights are dim
were looking at a blank pull down movie screen in a darkened ballroom
hang on i got this someone o
starts clinking a fork against a wine glass
is joined by others and then we hear calls of kiss
sitting at the main table in silhouette seen from behind lit only by the votives sprinkled along the table john grogan and his bride of two hours jenny
in response to the crowd they kiss
standing right by them is sebastian tall good looking rugged type johns best man
alright now im ready and now on the portable screen sebastians montage begins john with his mom in front of the college dorm etc
heres john first week of college
nice hair right
you think that feathering s easy
takes a very well p wrist action
chuckles from the crowd
im just saying
was john a star athlete
a shot of him fumbling a frisbee umm no
was he a ladies man
with mid eighties hair bad glasses
you tell me
what he was was john and we loved for it
up l a ni ghte sebastian turns the camera on himself holds sharpie pen smiles
and he was always looked after by his guardian angel and best friend
john walking down the quad with dumbass written on his forehead
people passing him are smirking
to camera which is people are staring at me is my fly down
no no its cool
all right enough with the as he gets another giggle all right what
what are you looking at
oh wait theres something on your forehead
john brushes it
you got it
leaf or something
on my forehead
yeah it musta had some sap on it
they pass a cluster of co eds who laugh at john
and then theres jenny
looking indeed very cool very put together
studious hard working quiet
in short shorts wet t shirt throwing water balloons at a frat house
standing on an empty keg of beer rolling it like its a log
well okay sometimes not so quiet
ordering a bunch of guys around telling who to go where as the camera zooms out we see theyre playing touch football except she tackles
and then does a little victory dance over the fallen
jennys the captain in charge
okay maybe a little high spirited maybe voted miss kegger once or twice too often on fraternity row but a good girl underneath it all
now could they not fall in love
one of john flexing beside a lake another of jenny screaming at a football game with a beer in her hand
now in any decent love story you gotta have the great first meeting
sebastian is obviously the passenger shooting john whos driving
all right im zooming in
not a flosser
turn it off
and as he reaches for it wham
he hits another car
the camera goes flying
theyre getting out
sebastian manages to right the camera and unsteadily films john getting out of the car heading towards the car he hit
the passenger door opens and jenny comes out
shes covered in frosting and the remains of a birthday cake which she was carrying in her lap
the damaged car is full of balloons
are you a complete idiot
and so one of the truly great love affairs of the late eighties began
in the home video jenny advances on john hurls the rest of the cake at him starts flailing at him with her hands
the driver of the car another co ed gets out and yells at camera sebastian
brought together by their love of fast cars spirited baskin robbins dreamy drizzle ice cream cake
john and jenny both at typewriters
from there they went on to work together at the school newspaper
shot of jenny standing at the head of a table full of reporters
although technically they didnt work together so much as john worked for jenny who was the editor of said paper
in her office through the semi closed venetian blinds
lets just say there were some flagrant workplace violations
john and jenny both in cap and gowns drinking from plastic champagne glasses
john displays the top of his cap to camera the words need job are spelled out in white adhesive tape
the point is their love grew blah blah blah
and that love continues tonight
the wedding guests applaud the lights come up and sebastian concludes his toast
and now please join me in raising a glass to my future neighbors down in florida and to the dawn of both a marriage end a brilliant journalistic team the
new woodward and bernstein this time with sex
bad sex probably but anyway to john and jenny grogan
shes had an ffect on hes not so much break applause
they kiss as pull back to reveal were looking out a window
that feels so good
the two of them sit on the edge of the bathtub soaking their sore feet
jennys still in her wedding dress bunched up so as not to get it wet
john has got the pant legs of his tux rolled up
jenny takes a swig from a bottle of champagne passes it to john
he looks at her
how do i get vou
in what world does a guy like me get someone like you
are you kidding
leans on him youre part of the plan
meet an incredibly sweet smart sexy guy
she smiles puts her face right up to his
now that ones a surprise
they kiss and as we push past them into the snowy window we end credits and
a heat mirage
a battered toyota tercel comes over
we follow the car through town get jenny driving
john clutching his portfolio on his lap
she cuts a look at him
as jenny pulls up out front of the building
she turns to john
you know you got this
i know i got it
who are you
im john grogan
youre john friggin grogan whos about to get a job
she leans over and gives him a big long kiss
um okay see now i dont wanna get out of the car
i really just wanna sit here and make out with you
get out of the car
he nods starts to get out then pauses
who am i again
as john crosses his fingers waves and enters the building
sebastian says you won some award
arnie klein fifties never smiles flowered shirts the editor of the sun sentinel of fort lauderdale florida is flipping through johns portfolio
yes sir i got a mitchy
off arnies look
like a pulitzer but for western michigan
so tell me why did you want to leave the estimable he flips to a story reads kalamazoo gazette
well as you know sebastian and i were in college together and he was always talking about south florida
mostly about the women of south florida but anyway after my wife and i got married we thought it might be nice to come for the women
uh no for the
for the work
your wifes jenny havens right
well jenny grogan now she take the job at the post
i tried to get her over her damn fine writer
whats the matter the post didnt want yo m
well she does features
im more a straight news writer
this is a better paper for that
straight news writer huh
meaning you think youre a reporter
meaning i know i am
and the six other sweaty palmed college grads im interviewing today you think youre better than them
in fact im pretty sure im not
but i do know that i always seem to surprise myself
ten years ago i was doing bong hits and playing donkey kong never dreamed id get into college
but i did and i graduated with honors
two years ago my buddies told me that the most jenny havens would ever say to me was youre sweet but i dont like you in that way
but she did like me in that way and my buddies can suck it because i married her
i certainly never thought id win some award with a dumbass name the mitchy
but i surprised myself and i won it
and if you give me the chance im pretty sure ill surprise you too
arnie considers him a moment
thats quite a speech son
you rehearse that or come up with it on the fly
elevator on the way up
howd i do
arnie just looks back at him
jenny is writing in her notebook when we see john crossing the street through the passenger window
she looks at him
afraid to ask
hes got me on a little thing they like to call
desert storm she gets out of the car and the two embrace right there on the street
she takes out her notebook crosses something off on her list
so whats next
a horn honking as a ca g nos by on the dixie highway in the b
we tilt down to a very mixed neighborhood to a modest house the sound of a tv broadcast over
news footage of iraqs invasion of kuwait on television
john and jenny sit at the table reading a different newspapers
he glances at her
you like the quote about the speed bumps
if they save even one life it would be worth it
and with that janet dickersons mothers eyes filled with tears
that one just felt exactly right yknow
yeah no its good
what happened to the desert storm piece
the injured girls dads in kuwait
what thats not in there
looks at the article uhhhh
they mustve cut it
and they kinda misspelled your name
what youre kidding he reaches for the paper but she holds it away
its good john
its got facts some color
its a solid piece
im almost done with yours
this idea of voting machines sounds well except on the other page i talk about what could happen he goes back to reading
she sips her coffee
oh it continues
an awkward moment as he now searches for the new page has to fold back the paper
no escaping the fact that ie article is longer and more important than his
she finally gets up
you know what
the rest is just okay really pretty boring
no no im enjoying it
he tortures himself and keeps reading
she moves to the sink starts to rinse out her cup
wow they really gave you a lot of space didnt they
she sets the cup on the counter looks at the wilted plant on the sill
i killed another one
how am i ever going to take care of a kid i cant even keep a plant alive
john looks up from the paper
she comes gives him a kiss
ill see you later mr
she headsout leaving john staring terrified at the plant
a kid huh
sebastian and john fill up at the coffee pot start to move through the office throughout
well whatd you expect
you bought a house man
a house with a mare room
whats wrong with a spare room
its empty john
thats whats wrong with it
and you know what else is empty
im starting to worry that were already at step six
you know jenny shes got her whole life organized and planned out
sebastian smiles at a secretary turns back to john
you want my advice
get her a puppya a puppy
something other than you she has to take care of
points at him you have a kid youre a dad
youre not you anymore
you have a dog youre a master
youre still a guy
with a life
and a dog
youre still free
youve stopped the clock
you know in movies when theres like a bomb and its ticking down ten seconds left and theres some guy with a wire cutter going red wire
which one do i cut
and the guy finally just makes a wild assed guess and snip
the world is saved
is the bomb strapped to a dog
because im not sure im john you buy this dog youre saving your world
because that ticking you hear is not a bomb its her biological clock
john looks back at him
they both turn as arnie sticks his head out of his office
your travels approved
get outta here
where you going
i got a guy down there says he can put me next to pablo escobar im doing this piece i follow a single coca leaf from colombia to the streets
yeah you and i once talked about doing something like that
we were gonna call it from plant to pusher
there was another fire at the county dump
some kinda methane leak
actually its grogan i want two paragraphs for the blotter
john nods looks off at sebastian who now sits down at his cluttered desk pulls a duffle bag from under his desk
john watches with envy as sebastian starts stuffing cameras recorders a bowie knife into the duffle
so uh what kind of puppy
sebastian looks up at him
to yknow cut the wire
get her a lab
theyre supposed to be just like little kids
but easier to train
as john and jenny get out of the car
she looks at the house
this isnt the ihop
a little surprise first
john is leading jenny her eyes closed through a house towards the kitchen
lori leathery and smoking is going in front
sorry about the smell
when can i look
just hang on
lori opens a door to a laundry room
jenny opens her eyes and sees a utility room
nine yellow yipping lab puppies tumble out of a cardboard box towards john and jenny
oh my god
wait a minute my birthdays a month from now
thats okay they cant leave for another three weeks anyway
john we never even talked about this
and besides jennys already on the floor letting the puppies climb all over her
look at you guys
i got papers on the mom and the dad so you can register these
is the father here too
oh yeah somewhere
anyway girls are boys are
except this little guy here
she points to one male puppy who is clearly the goofiest most excited
you can have him for
hes on clearance
well hes a little too stocky for the breed so he probably wont show
hes so sweet
marley he shooting draft
he likes you
john i dont know if im ready for a you have to wait three weeks for the litter to get weaned before you can bring em home anyway
plenty of time to get ready
i wont even be here
im gonna be with my sister then
i can take him
be good bonding time
get him all trained in time for you to come home
a chuckle from lori
lets give em all the scare test
i hear the best dog in the litter is the one who doesnt spook easily
they turn out to be the most people centered
uh how are you gonna john turns away and then suddenly turns back with a loud step and a boo
all of the puppies scatter
but clearance puppy just leaps onto his shoes his tail wagging
well thats your guy
john scoops him up
clearance puppy licks his face
john hands him to jenny
she lets him lick her face
i wouldve picked you anyway meant to be
he watches her cuddle the puppy and knows hes done the right thing
lori waves goodbye check in her hand as john and jenny walk to the car
jenny carries a polaroid of clearance puppy
you really sure about this
i mean a puppys a lot of work
how hard could it be
we hear a commotion is coming from the woods something crashing through the brush breathing heavily
they both freeze as the sound comes their way
just then they are nearly knocked off their feet by a huge rampaging labrador soaking wet covered with mud and burrs
it circles them barking wildly a crazed look in its eye
it jumps up on john muddies his shirt then barrels past lori into the house knocking over a chair on the porch as it goes
i think we just met the dad
john kissing jenny good bye
they finally part
call me as soon as you get him home
oh hey we need a name
how bout i just call him clearance puppy until you get back
i only hope he doesnt say his first word without you
john steps out of his car and the puppy now twice the size he was three weeks ago bounds over to him
a harried lori follows a rope leash and instruction
sheet in hand
he got big
this is the right one right
you should see him pack away the puppy chow
so what if i run into any problems
sure call me
all sales are final though
not just for him
i tell that to everyone
you want help getting him in the car
no thats okay ill just
john opens the door indicates that marley should jump in
instead the puppy runs around the car barking jumping up on the bumpers
john finally catches him lifts him up puts him on the front passenger seat atop some towels
there we go
well anyway thanks for but loris already inside her house the door closed
john and the puppy on the drive home
the puppy atop a pile of towels
john looks at him
the dog just stares at him quizzically
uncomfortable alone with the dog john turns on the radio
bob marley plays and the puppy thumps his tail
you like bob marley
the dog thumps his tail again
john turns up the music
thump faster this time
trying it out bob
nothing then marley
but now the pup starts wriggling towards john john tries to put him back
no stay boy
the dog crawls into his lap okay not really safe bud marley gets stuck with half his body draped over the console
he remains like this his tail thumping
john gives up
alright fine but just this time
the dog john pulls up in the driveway and opens the jumps out
this is our house
the dog immediately pees on the ground
and now its yours
as john crouches down shows him his bowls
this ones water
this ones food
marley starts pawing the food bag
cmon man youve already had kibble and half a seat belt
moment relents all right
but just today
he opens the bag and marley tackles it
several cupfuls spill onto the floor
john goes to the pantry to get the dustpan and brush
when he returns he finds marley has eaten the food in the bowl and every last scrap of spilled food
and now hes squatting to pee again
no no no
he picks up the puppy and rushes him outside
as john sets him down on the ground steps back
he motions with his zipper
cmon man do your thing
marley just stares alright im gonna show you this one time
from behind we see john peeing
except you gotta lift your leg
lifts his leg see this is how you guys do it
marley looks at him squats and pees
or you could do it like that
just not in front of other guy dogs
jennys on the phone
her young niece and nephew wait for her a board game on the floor between them
she motions that shell just be a second
i like that
johns on the phone talking to jenny as he follows marley around the room trying to keep shoes and socks and cords out of his mouth
are you sure
because it can be temporary
no its good
he must be exhausted
oh yeah hes pooped
marley lets out a squeak as he tugs at a couch cushion
oh he sounds so sweet
snapping his fingers at the dog shaking his head no hes very cute
just like a little kid only furrier
put the phone by his ear
john chases after the dog who burrows under the couch his tail sticking out so that john cant get him
uh okay hes listening
john just holds the phone awkwardly as jenny coos baby talk
into the phone hey marley
whos my good boy
mommy cant wait to meet you
anyway dont worry hes doing great
like hes lived here his whole life
all eight weeks of it
and you know what else
i think hes going to be pretty easy to train
i mean hes curious which means hes smart right
of course he is
i cant wait to see him
im not the one sleeping in a box
i love you
ill see you friday
john dressed to go out is setting down marley in his wooden box on the garage floor
ill see you in the morning okay
marley looks at him with a heartbreaking expression
aw come on dont
youll be fine alright
and tomorrow were gonna tear it up
im thinking kibble park chew toy the whole nine yards
marley doesnt look so good looks kind of sad
john turns and gets out of there
john gets into his car
he can hear whimpering
big day tomorrow
rest up pal
he listens a beat marley quiets down
he gets in his car
journalist hang out
john and sebastian at the bar
many know sebastian hes constantly nodding at people throughout so im there in this cave right
and i can feel the machine guns theres like nine of em around me
and they tie me to a chair and then escobar comes in and says are you ready
i read your piece on kadahfi and i think you captured his narcissism just right
can you believe that
some of it
man i wish you couldve been there
yeah but then i wouldnt have been able to do the piece on the water main break at the library
that would have sucked
hand on johns shoulder your time will come amigo
ill drink to that they toast with their beers sebastian clocks john looking at his watch
you gotta be somewhere
no its the puppy
its his first you got adoc
a little lab
like you said
slaps him on the back youve just preserved your quiet way of life for at least another two years
john pulls up gets out of his car
halfway down the block we see a police car lights flashing two officers talking to a couple
another neighbor in his robe stands in the street watching
millers got robbed again
then turns to john and that mutt of yours hasnt shut up since you left
john looks towards the garage where we hear whimpering
the door opens and the puppy gets excited no no
i just wanted you to know im back
the puppy whimpers and he goes over to him reaches into the box and pets him
buddy you really gotta chill okay
yeah i know good to see you too
but im just inside the house ill see you in the morning
big day tomorrow
get some sleep
john gulps orange juice from the bottle
leaves a quarter inch puts it back in the fridge
and now we hear barking from the garage
john swallows some preventative aspirin picks some nachos off his shirt
he turns off the water
and we hear wailing and keening coming from the garage
john has his head buried under the pillows as the wailing and keening go on
finally john cant take it anymore
he sits up pulls earplugs out of his ears
as the light comes on and marleys head appears over the top of the box
john sighs comes over and scoops him up
john gets marley settled in the box now by the side of the bed
just this one time
john climbs into bed shuts off the light
marley whimpers and john rolls onto his stomach reaches into the box and strokes his back the puppy lays down still whimpers
oh come on
half drunk sings badly one love one heart
lets get together and feel alright
john nods off one arm hanging over the side of the bed into the box his hand resting on marleys back as the puppy now snoozes peacefully and we then
tail rising in the b
as john opens his eyes to see marley snuggled up against his face
marleys eyes looking into his
john reaches over the puppy and shuts off the alarm
she comes home today
hung over he sits up looks around the messy room half due to johns bachelor housekeeping habits half due to marley
not only has everything has been chewed but some time during the night marley discovered how much fun toilet paper is
we should probably clean up
john vacuums struggles to empty the bag puts a broken vase in the trash does the dishes etc
marley follows him tail wreaking havoc knocking over everything that isnt nailed down
john picks up the huge chew toy hed just bought and examines it as marley runs into the bathroom
its already completely gnawed up
john looks at marley who emerges dragging a roll of toilet paper rams right into the screen door bounces back
marley its a screen youre not gonna meanwhile marley backs up a few steps gets a head of steam then rams into it again this time goes right through it
john gets drenched as he gives marley a bath
john drags marley into the garage
ill be back in an hour
a bit of thunder as john comes out with a bag of groceries and a bunch of flowers
he gets to the car just as the rain hits
as john and jenny kiss outside the terminal
she holds a stuffed pluto
hows my puppy
a little tired but she nudges him
he gives her another kiss
hes waiting for you
john and jenny get out of the car
we hear whimpering in the garage
she takes off for the side door of the garage
they open the door and freeze
oh my god
its a mess
its almost incredible that its all due to a single puppy
the box is in shreds so are the blankets
a puddle of urine on the floor
a large piece of dry wall has been chewed off near the big garage door
the garbage cans are overturned
marley is whimpering in the corner
okay this is not how i left it
how long has he been in here
an hour at the most
looks around then jeez
he alg drywall
thats just not right
she picks him up look
hes shaking another bit of thunder and the puppy whimpers louder
does thunder scare you mister
he licks her face snuggles into her
she gives him the pluto stuffed animal
she hugs him
look at us
she looks up at john and smiles
he returns the smile
as marley bursts out of the back bedroom with one of jennys bras in his mouth
jenny chases him into the kitchen past john who holds up the newspaper
he gave me an extra paragraph
marley bursts through the back screen door
a seemingly continuous shot except that its now a six month old marley who comes through the screen into the backyard now clutching a set of curtains in his mouth
still attached to the rod and its now john who stumbles through the broken wire mesh to chase after him
john chases him across the backyard
marley goes under the fence and john starts to go over into
and now its a nine month old marley who comes up from under the fence clutching a thanksgiving turkey in his mouth
and now its jenny and john who go over the fence chasing him
they wave to the neighbor standing on his patio watching
hi tom sorry
marley goes through a hedge and out onto
where marley emerges into frame a full grown dog rapidly pulling jenny by the leash along the intercoastal waterway
we track with him until a woman walking a poodle is now in frame and marley gets the two women entangled as he starts humping the smaller dog
john sits across from arnie
he looks thrown i dont understand why me
im in a bind john
but im a reporter not a columnist
its a step up
yeah but its a step away from what i wanna do
its also better pay you set your own hours pick your own topics
and its only temporary just until i find someone permanent
what happened to jerry
you may have noticed that in every other column he went on about the pie palace
i really havent read his turns out hes been getting free meals in exchange for mentioning the joint
its also why he became such a fat ass
anyway its twice a week
and like i said its only until i can find someone else to replace him
then youre back on uh
whatever beat you were on
john pulls up gets out of the car
his neighbors the year old girl short blue hair pierced eyebrow and her mom in a nurses uniform unload groceries from the car
your dogs funny
he tried to eat one of our tires
yeah well dogs need rubber
little known fact helps the digestive tract
along with the occasional black converse high top which id still love to get back by the way
ill do what i can
john sits at the table scribbling on a legal pad
he tears off the sheet and crumples it up throws it across the room
marley bounds into the room jenny behind him sweating
i think he dislocated my shoulder
he doesnt heel hell he doesnt even walk he sprints and i had to pull him off three dogs
yeah among others
there was a yorkie a dalmatian and a bichon frise that may never be right again
sees the legal pad whatre you doing
arnie gave me a column
oh yeah its a big honor
i get to write about zoning laws and yard sales
i bet you make something out of it
its only temporary until he finds someone else
im just trying to get something down for tuesday
she gives him a kiss starts out of the room youll think of something
and john im serious abut marley
he wreaks havoc everywhere he goes
we gotta do something
kornblut weathered and stern is studying john
behind john eight puppies and their owners are chatting before the class begins
i dont believe in that
all dogs want to learn
but they cant when their owners are weak willed
im very strong willed
and where is your animal
hes over there
with my wife
he was a little excited
he usually needs a little time to calm down
kornblut looks at jenny as she struggles up with marley
he calls the shots
which of you will be the trainer
we thought we both would since we want him to listen to both of us at home a dog can only answer to one master
which one of you has the most natural authority in your own relationship
i thought so
kornblut gestures demonstrates the command sit
the students order their dogs to sit and most of them do
the ones that dont require only a little effort to get the idea
whereas jenny orders marley to sit instead marley jumps up on her and puts his paws on her shoulders
she presses his butt to the ground and he rolls over for a belly rub
she tries to tug him into place and he grabs the leash in his teeth shaking it playfully
that class is an example of a dog that has been foolishly allowed to believe he is the alpha male of his pack
and therefore he cannot be a happy animal
from the sidelines yeah he looks really bummed
kornblut hears him death stares john
john looks at jenny who shrugs holds up the leash for him to take
kornblut demonstrates on her wrist
the choke chain
when your animal walks properly by your side therell be slack
if he pulls it tightens around his neck like a noose and loosens as soon as he stops pulling
does it hurt them
well its not called a hug chain
but they learn to like it
go on collar your dogs
everyone else quickly easily gets the choke chain around their dogs necks
meanwhile john kneels down and struggles to put it
around marleys neck
marley liking its shiny jingling tries to eat it
much tussling and john finally gets it around marleys neck but marley still manages to grab it in his teeth
he likes it
thats because hes eating it
get it out of his mouth
give your dogs the sit command
all the dogs sit john forces marleys butt down
the leash is held in two places
loop around your right hand left hand at waist level
dog always on your left of course
that means us pal
he rearranges marley so hes on johns left
now when you give the heel command step off with your left foot i dont want to see any right foot first steppers and walk
if your dog gets ahead administer a correction by forcefully bring your left hand down and towards the right and hell respond
one two three now
just as the dogs and owners prepare to step off marley lurches ahead of the pack
marley takes off like a fighter jet dragging john behind
john gives a mighty yank on the leash
marley coughs hesitates
john loosens the leash and marley explodes forward again
john yanks marley stops john releases marley explodes forward
rein in that dog
all right everyone line up again
she takes the leash from john and efficiently guides him into line with the other dogs
its a simple question of confidence in ones own authority
shall i demonstrate a simple walk
be my guest
even an unruly dog wants to obey his leader
and she steps off confidently but marley is a bit more confident than she is
he lunges she pulls he falls back on his hind legs then barrels up and lurches forward
kornblut half stumbles half rockets across the park
she manages to turn marley around and the whole process begins again as they make their way back to the line
her face is flushed with embarrassment anger and exertion but marley jowls frothing is having a ball
its like a walking tug of war
with difficulty ms
kornblut manages to return marley to john but not before as a coup de grace he starts humping her leg enthusiastically
she struggles he knocks her down and then he buries his face in her crotch and humps her knee
john and jenny rush over
john restrains marley jenny helps up mrs
he usually just does this with poodles
looking at her bad perm maybe its the hair
hes a bad influence on the others
leg humping is a virus
once it takes hold in a group he has to go
as they follow marley back into the house
well that was fun
to the dog congratulations marley
you flunked obedience school
you know john there is something else we can do looks at her no no im not doing that to him
and hell be a lot more comfortable
itll calm him down
yeah you know why hell be calmer
because hell have nothing to look forward to
whatre you talking about
there are plenty of other things thatll make him thats where youre wrong
trust me jen i know
im a guy
and yeah lots of things make us happy but the only thing we really look forward to is sex
runner up the possibility of sex
every book says hell live itll just feel longer
john hes out of control
its the right thing to do
john sighs looks at marley whos now humping the stuffed goofy that jenny gave him as a puppy
jenny at the wheel
john in the passenger seat
marley in the back his front paws balanced on the center console
it wont be so bad buddy
sex is overrated
marley looks at him
okay im lying and i think you know that
so maybe the best thing is to just not talk about it
jenny cuts him a look
he lowers his voice
poor son of a bitch
a guilty john cracks the window just a bit and marley begins listing to starboard leaning against john to catch a whiff of the outdoor smells
marley crawls onto johns lap
oh okay you wanna sit up here
marley now jams his nose into the small opening snorting to catch the fresh air least i can do
john lowers the window and marley gets his whole snout out
here you go
john lowers the window again and now marley sticks his whole head out ears flapping behind him tongue hanging out like hes drunk
hes so happy
he has no idea whats about to happen to him
jenny looks over as marley hooks his paws over the half open window so that his neck and upper shoulders now hang out of the car
hes making me nervous
he just wants a little suddenly marley slides his front legs out the window until his front armpits are resting on the glass
john grab him
before john can do anything marley is off his lap and scrambling out the window of the moving car
hes onto our evil plan and hes making a break for it
but now his butt is up in the air his hind legs clawing for a foothold
as jenny slows down in heavy traffic john lunges out the window after marley grabs the end of his tail with one hand so that marley dangles upside down outside
the car by his tail
he trots along the pavement with his front paws
jenny gets the car stopped horns honking behind them
uh little help here
he cant pull the dog back in the window and he cant open the door
he cant let go as angry drivers behind them are now starting to swerve around them
john hangs on for dear life
i got him
as jenny puts on the flashers and gets out of the car runs around to the passenger side
a group of cars drive slowly by in the other direction all watching and laughing
what are you looking at
hes losing his balls today
cut the guy some slack
john sits at his desk tries to write a column
sebastian in a flak jacket pauses at his desk
strip mall get approved
riveting planning commission vote
you up for a beer
cant i gotta finish the column
cant ill be in l
part of that drug piece im doing right
another time then
john watches him move off a secretary giving sebastian a big smile as he passes
john sits there another moment looks at his desk
a photo of him and jenny
one of marley with a flip flop in his mouth
john chuckles to himself then deletes the column starts typing a new one
john sits anxiously across from arnie who sits at his desk reading
the editors expression is grim as he looks up at john
im really sorry ill go back and do the zoning piece the hell you sorry for
john sits back down looks at arnie
see the thing is arnies face doesnt say hilarious but
i loved it
getting kicked out of obedience school the humping the great escape all of it
again arnies face remains dead serious as he passes the paper back to john
thank you sir
john starts out of the office
tell him not to feel bad
sooner or later we all lose our balls
ill be sure to pass that on
live music a sexy vibe
john and jenny sit outside in the hot florida night
dinner over john raises his glass
to two years
that was fast
good though right
he lifts out of his chair and kisses her a long one
i was thinking desert
no i mean on your list
ed remember when we first got marri you had this whole checklist with like the game plan
so what came next
a new car maybe
we can do that
what was you sure you wanna know
well it was between a new roof and a baby
he studies her for a long moment then
i can probably live with a few leaks
because a leak can turn into something bigger
and that can be a big responsibility
i was just thinking that we might want everything fixed before we went to the next step
well weve already fixed marley
marley he shooting draft youre serious about this
i think so
jenny t an and you know were not talking abou actual roof here
yeah i got that
she looks back at him finally nods
maybe instead of tying to have a baby we should stop trying to not have one
if im following you correctly and i think i am this is the part where we go home and get it on right
as jenny pushes john back onto the bed starts kissing things getting hot and heavy quickly
as they kiss
did you eat some kibble
and now they part and we see marleys huge face resting on the side of the bed watching panting up a storm
marley get out of here
its fine hes a dog he doesnt what hes looking at
oh he knows and trust me he the hell out of me right now
go on marley
but marley jumps up on the bed tries to climb on both of marley
and now they both start laughing as the dog tries to lick their faces
arnie reads johns column his face dead serious
this is even funnier than the last one
thank you sir
youre good gorgan
and not just the dog stuff
the piece on the women of boca last week
whatd you call them
john nods starts for the door
is it true what you wrote
you and the wife are trying to have a kid
well were not really trying
hows that work
are you having sex
with the intention of getting pregn i guess
john just stands there
arnie looks back at him
i assume youve thought this through
yeah i mean
john walks out of the office pensive sits down at his his phone rings
jenny on the phone looking at a dry erase calendar
i just thought id let you know that im ovulating
just in case you wanted to come home
like right now
in the f
stands a harried thirty something father with a screaming infant in a bjorn
john stands just behind the father who bounces in place trying unsuccessfully to soothe the baby
and now another kid year old girl jumps up in and out of frame
i wanna push the button
daddy cant lift you right now jumps up again you said i could push the button
alright okay ill just he tries to pick her up without leaning over
youre hurting me
okay you know what
never mind no button
a very uncomfortable john now steps forward
you want me to give her a hand
oh would you mind
john lifts the girl up to the panel
she runs her hands from top to button down the panel pressing every single button
and now the little girl starts bawling in concert with the baby while a trapped john backs up into the corner
john gets out of the car
the young girl next door gives him a wave as she starts down the sidewalk with her boyfriend
john watches the young couple go arms around each other
john enters and is greeted as usual by marley who jumps on him
out in a sec
john stands there marley looking at him
to the dog so
this is us not trying
the bathroom door opens and jenny walks out in a tiny silky two piece thing
she walks into the bedroom
john looks back at marley as he follows her into the bedroom
catch you later buddy
and closes the door on the dog
john and sebastian sit at the bar
so the puppy wasnt enough
well technically were not trying
but you know jenny
but things are good right now just as they are right
yeah things are really good
so why change it up with a kid
i mean have you already forgotten my little cautionary tale
the bomb right
and just so were clear the countdown sequence has been reactivated
well its been a few months and nothings happened
which actually makes me wonder if mr
the bartender sets a phone down in front of john
i loved that thing you did on your dog watching you and your wife have sex
really funny stuff
seriously man your stuff is classic
well its just temporary but thanks
john cuts a look at sebastian picks up the phone
i just wanted to let you know that theres a naked blonde in your bed
why dont you two get started and ill be there as soon as i can
can you come home
ill make it worth your while
ill see what i can do
he hangs up
looks at sebastian
uh im sorry man but i gotta jam
i forgot i had this thing i gotta deal shes calling you home isnt she
see you later
john starts out of the bar
sebastian calls after him
tick tick tick
romantic music on the stereo
john comes in wearily absently pets marley
he goes into the bedroom
the bathroom door is open
john sits down on the bed
you know this baby thing
i been thinking maybe we should take a break
obviously its not happening
maybe thats natures way of saying its not good timing
no sound from jenny
he struggles on
maybe this is a sign that were not ready for this
i mean have we really thought this through
because he looks up to see jenny at the bathroom door
from her back she brings out a home pregnancy test strip
pause then great
but you just said yeah no i mean okay this is definitely awkward now but
you wanna start over
by all means
i gotta be honest im a little panicked
are you panicking because im pregnant
or because youre afraid im going to hit you
its a twofer thing
are you scared
not at all
then looks at her yeah yeah im pretty scared
sits down next to him me too
but were gonna be okay
look at me
he looks at her
she smiles at him
were gonna be okay
i believe you
he looks at her stomach kisses her there
as john hands arnie his latest column
thats probably the last one about marley for a while
but in about nine months im gonna have a new subject might be just as fun
im very happy for you
have you bought her a present
a gift john
shes carrying a child
dont you think thats worth something
you dont wanna make the mistake i did
listen to me
theres gonna come a time shes fat shes nauseous her ankles are swollen and shes gonna look at you and this is what that look will mean you bastard
you did this to me
you dick you ruined me
shes gonna remember that little ring bracelet anklet whatever that you bought her and shes gonna feel better
indicates the door can i just go ahead
theres a jeweler on the corner
mention my name
lit with candles
jenny and john on the couch
she removes a beautiful gold necklace from a box and holds it up
oh john its beautiful
she sets it down on the coffee table then moves close to him
she kisses him
i was just thinking about you when i walked by the store and saw it in the window
that is so sweet
put it on
she turns back to the coffee table and looks around
whered it go
it was right here
you just put it down
it cant have and then he stops
so does jenny
marley stands a few feet away looking strangely gleeful
a glint of gold in the moonlight dangles from his mouth
they both get up start to move towards him
look what i got for you
we dont want any trouble
yeah heres a little something imaginary treat
marley she reaches into her pocket for an moves looks at her
is this a trick
then he closer
john tiptoes up behind him ever so slowly
i just want to give you a treat and a big kiss
thats a boy
inch by inch marley approaches her
but then behind marley john knocks against a table
he made me
jenny lurches for marley going for his collar and john leaps at him from behind
marley skitters away
ah a game
he wags his tail prances sticks his rear in the air and his puts his head to the ground
john feints tries to maneuver marley back into jenny
jenny finally grabs him from behind
john pries open his mouth
he reaches inside looks up at jenny
john grimaces in the morning sun as he watches marley poop
he takes a hose and squirts at the deposit until it runs into the lawn
jays sending over a laxative
john hoses through marleys huge orange iridescent poops
man you gotta lay off the mangoes
you know years ago when i pictured my life somehow standing in my backyard hosing down dog crap in search of my brides swallowed and recycled ass kissing gift just
didnt spring to mind
carefully jenny lifts the shiny necklace out of a glass filled with bleach
i think its shinier than before
he did us a favor
and i only threw up eight times
the nurse arranges the gown on jenny
hows that crazy dog of yours
smiles at john im a big fan
the heartbeatll be very fast like a little train
is it too soon to tell the sex
not that i care
he can be any sex he wants
male female we dont care
unambiguous genitalia if we had our druthers but whatever
she listens for a moment with a little microphone hooked up to a speaker
sometimes you cant hear it depending on how the baby is lying
youre ten weeks right
next monday yes
might be a little early for that
lets go right to the sonogram
did you bring your blank tape
waving it smiling ready to roll
lets get a good picture first
itll be on the monitor there
the nurse begins running the instrument around jennys stomach
john and jenny peer at the computer screen
this one doesnt seem to be picking up anything
excuse me ill be just a minute
jenny and john smile at each other but inside each of them a small pinpoint of fear starts to expand
we wait for a few moments
a pressured silence
smiles down at dr
sherman comes in followed by the nurse jenny
lets have a look at your baby shall we
he takes the instrument all right there we go
now look over there
much better resolution right
jenny and john holding hands look at the computer screen
they see a sac which with a click of the mouse dr
sherman expands and expands
but its empty
jenny tries to smile
is there anything in there
not what youd expect to see at ten weeks
not quite ten weeks
sherman looks at them directly
kindly jenny im sorry but theres no heartbeat
john and jenny are still silent
one in six pregnancies ends this way
it just happens sometimes thats all
im very sorry
but youre young and healthy and in a couple of months you can try again
why dont you come by my office on your way out and we can talk some more
john is still holding the blank videotape
he tries to hide it from jenny
jenny and john look at each other
how could this happen
whatd i do wrong
you didnt do anything i must have
otherwise how could i lose it
jenny its not something you have any control over
its like the doctor said it just happens not to me
i did something wrong
i know it
i did something wrong
im sorry john
dont say that but i am im sorry i dont need sorry
you didnt do anything
she turns away and begins to cry
john just sits there staring at the videotape in his hands
outside in the hall the door to another examining room opens and they hear a couple laughing talking excitedly
jenny and john look away from each other their pain made even worse
john is driving jenny home
in a couple of months we can try again
jenny just looks out the window
john helps jenny through the kitchen door
marley follows them circles them wildly then stops puzzled as he looks at them
jenny goes into the living room marley follows her
you want some tea
hey you know what i was thinking
we still have those tickets from your parents for the honeymoon in ireland
we can finally do that
take some time off
itll be fun clear our heads right
he goes into the living room and stops cold jenny sits on the couch
marley stands at her feet with his shoulders between her knees his big head resting in her lap
his tail hangs flat between his legs
his eyes are turned up at her and he whimpers softly
jenny strokes his head a few times and then with no warning buries her face in the thick fur of his neck and begins sobbing
they stay like that for a moment marley statue still jenny clutching him to her like an oversized doll
john stands there watching marley take care of her
no words just being there
a lesson here
her head down jenny raises one arm up towards john and john goes to the couch and wraps his arms around both of them
with difficulty john holds back marley to protect debby glasses bookish the house sitter from his affection
close to a hundred pounds
re the leash struggle he just wants to say hi
he wont hurt you
just stand still and be calm
youre a dog person right
well actually ready
john releases marley who springs on debby knocking her back
hes not supposed to do that
you have to knee him
anyway it wont happen the whole time
just maybe when you come home
handing her a binder this is everything you need to know
john and jenny lug their suitcases across the front lawn to the car marley running around them
debbys glancing through the binder
welcome to our home
marley is a spirited dog who loves interaction
weve never left him before but were sure hell behave just as he does when were at home
they kiss him goodbye
get in the cab and go
debby runs to marley grabs his leash and struggles with all her might to hold on to marley
but this is and the planes fly half full
john reads about ireland in the guide book
jenny sees a woma with a child
there are just a few things about marley you need to know
he eats three times a day
if he looks starved feed him again
of course all this food has to go somewhere
debby looks at the piles of orange poop everywhere
use the red shovel and the blue bucket
watch your step
dont worry about the color
he likes mangoes
marley he shooting draft
john and jenny enjoy the scenery
sheep in the road surround their car
jenny leans out laughing and takes a picture
marleys ears get a lot of wax buildup
once or twice while were gone please use cotton balls and the blue ear cleaning stuff to clean them out
wear old clothes and try not to breathe
debby is throwing up in her mouth a little as she cleans marleys ears
marley loves it
marley is an excellent watchdog
and in this neighborhood thats a good thing
you can rest easy at night knowing hes on the job
debby ears plugged shades over her eyes weeps in frustration as marley howls at the moon
john and jenny stop at a bed and breakfast for the night
its raining softly
thunderstorms are his weak point
well one of his weak points
you can give him sedatives if you think a storm is arriving
he doesnt like them so push them down into his throat as far as they go
marley is tearing through the house terrified
chasing him with a bottle of tranquilizers
an irish widow mrs
butterly leads them to their room
marley he shooting draft
we do not allow marley to get up on any piece of furniture chew on anything except his toys drink out of the toilet keep the lid closed and the
brick on the lid debby is showering and then starts screaming
marley has stuck his head through the shower curtain and is licking the water
debby splashes water at him to make him go away
marley thinking shes playing scrambles into the tub with her
she grabs the curtain and it pops off the curtain rings one by one as in psycho
actually you might want to keep the bathroom door closed in general
debby has run out of the bathroom a towel hastily wrapped around her
marley chases her
he leaps and returns to earth with the towel in his mouth
debby is standing on a coffee table nude swatting at an unseen marley with a bunch of tall artificial flowers
other than that enjoy him
thanks so much
love jenny and john
four walls four different floral wallpapers
above one the sacred heart of jesus
above the other the sacred heart of mary
crucifixes everywhere you look and a huge framed picture of pope john xxiii
and if you need anything during the night im right next door
the blankets are wool
good heat in them
oh theyre electric
no not in this house
my brother died in a fire god rest him
in this room actually
its been re papered
jenny sits on the bed
the creaking is terrible
look i know we havent had sex since
but theres no way were breaking the streak tonight
cause its not just god watching
god his mother
indicating next door and apparently his best friend
they are in separate beds staring at the crucifix
its july but i think i can see my breath
i cant feel my toes
john gets out of his bed and into jennys
its not the mattress
its the shrieks of over sexed souls in hell
you wanna join them
he looks at her
are you sure because we dont have to
i cant help myself
knowing it hasnt happened in this house in years is a turn on
they roll into each others arms the bed squeaking
maybe shes deaf
the next morning
john and jenny looking flushed and relaxed and slightly abashed come downstairs
butterly looks at them sourly
so do the other guests
they heard us
he jumps as mrs
butterly slams the teapot on the table
looks him in the eye im off to mass
john and jenny look at the other guests
they smile bravely
any of you hear her bed squeaking last night
i hope she hits confession before mass thats all i can say
another widow another room another collection of religious artifacts
jenny sits on the bed smiles at the noise starts taking off her shoes
john ushers the owner out of the room
john and jenny pull into the driveway
they see debby the house sitter on the front steps with her bag packed
shes tired looking beat
she reaches for a pair of crutches
john gets out of his car a smile on his face
so how was debby hurls the binder of instructions at him
there were eleven thunderstorms while you were away
and you were right
he doesnt like thunderstorms
okay yeah wow
that is a lot
and those goddamned dog tranquilizers dont work
did you give him four at a time
i mean on humans
she hobbles to the car tries to get in with her crutches
they frustrate her and she ends up beating the ground with them until she throws them down
shes losing it
as she gets in the car and just so you know i am a dog person
but thats not a dog
thats evil with a dog face
thats also humping your leg
lose my number
and she gets into her car and guns it splintering the crutches as she peels out
john and jenny watch her go turn and look at the front door
marleys face in the little square window at the top peeking out at them
a thunderstorm outside
john sits at his desk tries to work while marley walks in circles
john looks at him
its only thunder
john goes back to work
we hear more thunder and marley starts howling knocks over a floor lamp
john looks off towards the bedroom
can you help me out here
i got twenty minutes to file this column
we follow john as he gets up from his desk heads towards the back bedroom
we follow him into the room an anxious marley close at his heels
shes not here he turns around just as she steps out of the bathroom smiling
luck of the irish
she holds up a pregnancy test with a clear blue line her exuberant face lit up by a flash of lightning
john goes to hug her as marley howls in the b
super nine months later
john and jenny are asleep
marley goes through his nighttime he chews through a sock
he drinks out of the toilet
he works on chewing through the plastic dog food tub
another night and hell be in
he chases a fly
finally he goes to his bed on the floor of the bedroom
he settles himself down to sleep
he yawns he scratches he closes his eyes
and then he wakes up suddenly alert
he looks over at jenny
he gets up sits by her side of the bed and waits
suddenly jenny sits up rests a hand on her stomach
she catches her breath leans over to john
john wake up
i think its time
jenny has finished dressing
suddenly she yelps in pain doubles over
john takes her in his arms
suddenly a growl
they turn to see marley glaring at john
im not hurting her
jenny moans again and now marleys eyes narrow
he takes a step towards john
please dont scream honey
hell kill me
you put the car seat in this weekend right
they wont let us take the baby home without the car seat installed
like id forget that
panicking john is struggling to get the car seat he forgot out of the box
he starts beating at the styrofoam
marley barks excitedly
john gets an idea hands him one end of the box
come on marley
help me out here
do what you do best
unsure marley licks the box
no dont lick it eat it
you can chew through drywall man
i know you can do this
marley catches on
he starts shredding the box
john hurls a suitcase and the partially assembled partially destroyed car seat into the back seat
he yells car seats in
jenny is tottering down the walk as john pulls out of the garage gets her into the passenger seat
marley barks from the back seat
they both turn and look at him
whats he doing here
john opens the front door drags marley in
john gives him a okay
the chew toy now almost completely gone
marley sleeps beside it as we hear a key in the lock and he gets to his feet greets john as he comes through the door
as john lets marley out
as john sets down a bowl of food crouches down as marley starts to eat
marley me blue revisions
heres the thing in a couple of hours were gonna bring the baby home
and youd be doing me a really big favor if you didnt freak out
stands sighs im gonna try and do the same thing
as the sun now streams in through the front windows down onto marley who is sound asleep
we hear a car door close and he raises his head
a moment later the front door opens and john comes in and marley greets him jumps up on his chest
lets go outside
as marley relieves himself john yawning in the b
as jenny unpacks her suitcase
marley bounds into the room and greets her
she crouches down gives him a kiss rubs his back
and thats when we hear a small birdlike chirp and the dog freezes
whered that come from
we hear the coo again and this time marley lifts one paw in the air like a bird dog and points in the direction of the car seat that we
now see sitting on the bed
you know what i think would be a bummer
if he ate the baby
harley me shooting draft
she moves to the car seat and turns it around so that now we see the baby for the first time
she smiles at marley
this is patrick marley
jenny unbuckles patrick from the car seat and crouches down beside marley and lets the dog sniff the babys toes then up his legs finally his diaper which puts marley
into a pampers stupor the holy grail of aromas and marleys eyes glaze
see hes not gonna hurt him
no but im gonna have to put a lock on the diaper pail
garbage day and the trash piled outside the grogan house testifies to the change inside
empty cartons of diapers the packaging from a crib a stroller the car seats the packnplay
jenny tries to watch the baby now crawling around on the floor and file her column over the phone at the same time
i have the quote right here patrick crawls over marley whos supremely patient as patrick takes a fistful of his eye
well have legal call them again and get a release for it
they told me it was on the record marley patrick thats his eye no not you karla just get the release
ill call you back
be gentle patrick
jenny leans back in her chair rubs her face
john sits on a bench marley at his feet reading what to expect in the first year
he takes a breath looks up watches a couple make out on a blanket
the baby in his high chair
jenny sets a few cheerios on the tray
patrick picks them up and drops them we follow them down
to where marley waits eagerly vacuuming up the cereal
it continues to rain cheerios and we then boom back up and see that patrick is now eight months old laughing as he throws the cereal onto the floor
john stands there letting marley out
he looks back at the house watches jenny through the window as she sets patrick down in his crib shuts the light out
theyre both working at their desks
jenny looks up from her computer
i need to go in tomorrow for a few hours see my editor
think you can watch the baby for me
john looks around the room
the place is a disaster area
you mean those younger skinnier better looking people
yeah i think i remember them
well i miss them
he turns back to his work
she looks at him sets her pad aside comes up behind him puts her arms around him
theyre still here
he looks up at their reflection in the window not so sure
john and jenny now asleep on opposite sides of the bed
on the floor beside john marley lifts his head and growls
we then hear a piercing scream coming from outside
the dog is already out of the room
john sits up immediately starts to get out of bed
honey dont go out there
call the police
marleys at the door growling as john in his boxer shorts grabs the dog by the choke chain and opens the door
we hear another scream coming from a couple houses down and marley breaks through the screen pulling john with him
as other lights come on neighbors start to come out onto the street
john runs to where we see the teenage girl next door bent over sobbing in her driveway beside her car drivers door still open
john lets go of marley and hurries to her
he said not to scream or hed stab me but i screamed
and john sees the blood on her shirt
he takes hold of her
okay okay okay ive got you
wheres your mom
jennyll call her
marley sniffs at the ground growling more and more intensely
we hear shouting he went that way as several neighbors take off running
marley lifts his head and he too bolts into the night marley
but hes gone and john has to stay with the girl
we hear sirens as she slides down the car and sits down on the ground
john sits down beside her holding onto her
all this time weve been living here i never got your name
well youre gonna be alright lisa the police are on the way
john looks off wondering where marley is
a crime scene
jenny clutching the baby stands on the porch watching as an ambulance pulls away
john now in shorts and a t shirt comes jogging up the walk
i cant find him anywhere
maybe we should get in the car drive around
ill get the keys
johns coming into the house when a police cruiser pulls to the curb in front of the house
a policeman gets out of the drivers side then opens the back and leads marley out
he bounds up the walk to the two of them who greet him
where were you
we found him outside the station on radford
he had the guy cornered in the mens room
so you caught the guy
jig caught the guy
he also gnawed the barrel of my shotgun and ate half my radio mic
they look at marley wagging his tail panting
anyway the neighbors all said he belonged here but none of them wanted to drive him so
thanks for bringing him home
john nods as the officer heads back to his car
jenny crouches down and gives marley a big hug and a back rub
an upscale newer money neighborhood
an open house sign out front
john pulls up
he opens the door holds up a hand to marley who sits in the back stay
and starts to unhook patrick from his car seat
marley bolts out of the car and heads straight for the house
a realtor is showing a couple around the large empty new house
she points out the designer kitchen that looks out onto the patio and pool a huge yellow lab now leaping in
a moment later we see john clutching patrick enter the backyard try to haul marley out of the pool
he gives up heads for the house opens the back door and peers inside
the realtor smiles awkwardly at him
can i see a set up please
looks at the baby first home
no we live up in west palm over on churchill
well i think youd find this neighborhood to be quite a pleasant change
and now marley bolts past him into the house tracking wet footprints all over the floor jumps up onto the realtor
hey whos dog is that
john enters carrying patrick supplies to fix the screen
a wet marley bounds into the house heads for the back
jenny is crouched on the floor when john appears in doorway
she stands up smiles the best she can
where you guys been
i wanna show you something
hands her the set up a house
before she can react its a little pricey but i think we can do it
john i know weve talked about it but im not sure this is the right time

after one of us gets stabbed in the driveway
cmon honey were cramped in here

she steps away revealing the counter where four pregnancy tests are lined up all with the same result positive
john sits with sebastian at his desk

john sits across from arnie

a moving van is parked out front

john sees lisa the girl next door as she comes out of her house
she walks over to him
well i dont blame you
i just thought id come over and say but marley comes running over and she crouches down to greet him

well take care lisa
oh he reaches into a moving box pulls out a chewed up black converse
i believe this belongs to you
ill have to chew up the other one to make it match
extends her hand have fun down there
its gonna be great
still beautiful but now we hear the sound of a baby wailing this is the elegant kitchen we saw bare and uninhabited several scenes ago
now its full of the clutter of the grogans life
the new baby conor is screaming
we follow jenny through the new house asshetries to soothe him
john follows now
is he wet
and i cant get a burp out of him
i think its colic
want me to drive him
we cant do that every night
from the other room we hear patrick crying mommy
ill do the washer
john sitting on the washer with his wailing baby
john looks to where marley lies in the corner watching
john is opening the cupboards getting cereal and yogurt into a bowl for patrick
jenny enters with a fussing conor on her shoulder
can you take him
i just need a minute to myself
john takes the baby and instantly conor starts crying louder
happens every time
you just need to spend more time with him
john puts conor on the changing table unbuttons his onesie checks his diaper
its wet he starts changing him
conor cries throughout
its okay ill do it
im doing it
you tell me to spend more time with him i do it and then you take over because im not doing it right
i dont want you changing him when youre mad
im not mad
he hears himself lets her change the baby
she takes him sits down with him in a rocking chair tries to nurse him
conor come on
she finally stops trying rocks the chair looks helplessly at john
i dont know whats wrong with me
mothers are supposed to be able to give their baby everything
hes just colicky jen
hell grow out of it
okay heres an idea you stay here and ill go to work while he grows out of it
he holds up his hands what does he say to that
she looks up at him a moment
im just tired alright
she then resumes trying to nurse the baby
he walks out of the room
she rocks back and forth looks up with a dark expression as she hears his car start
its post partum depression
john sits on a stool in front ofa portable screen while a pretty female photographer adjusts her lights
arnie sits nearby on a desk watching the portrait
her hormones are all on tilt and shes depressed
after my fourth kid was born id wake up find my wife just staring at me with a mallet in her hand
i thought she was gonna kill me in my sleep
i still do
did you get her the gift
that usually works
arnie gets off the desk says to the photographer alright janice make him look pretty
the mans an official columnist now
arnie moves off and the photographer looks up from her camera and smiles at john
he smiles back
she keeps smiling
so does he
she finally indicates his hair
you have a barney sticker in your oh thanks
he rakes his fingers through his hair grabs the offending sticker looks at her
i must look like hell
i dont think ive had a full night sleep in two months
i got one with colic and another cant make it through the night without coming into my room every two hours
well i think youre holding up great
you look cute
yeah like a cute exhausted dad
john just nods stupidly the dagger so deep in his heart hell never reach it
she smiles at him
you certainly look a lot better than jerry ever looked
i tried to get him to take a new picture but he liked the one they took the day he started the column nineteen years ago
nineteen years huh
and just when he thought one dagger was brutal enough his expression goes really pensive
and on that look we see a flash as she takes his picture and go right to john pulls into his driveway turns off the car and just sits there
as john looks at the house
the windows all lit up
inside jenny moves about with the baby over her shoulder as patrick chases marley around the room
john sits in the car unable to move just watching the chaos in the window
marley jumps up against the glass stands on his hind legs paws to the window and looks out
he barks and now jenny comes up behind him hauls him off the window and now sees john sitting in the car
she gives him a look that says whatre you doing
get in here
john quickly gets out of the car
john and jenny eat dinner in exhausted silence
patrick throws his food on the floor where a happy marley waits
conor starts crying o
and jenny gets up like a robot
ill get him
john leaves the room
jenny sits there
john and jenny are in bed asleep
patrick comes into their room
jenny wakes up on autopilot
okay honey lets go back to bed
she leads him out of the room
and a second later conor starts crying
john lies there a moment then gets up
through the doorway jenny her back to us gently bounces conor on her shoulder
john moves into frame
jen you okay
shes crying her back to john whos now in the b
a moment then
john comes into the kitchen just as jenny takes a chewed copy of good night moon from marleys mouth
you ruined it
she leaves the room and john looks at the dog
you just had to eat the book
what have you got some kind of death wish
im telling you you better chill or shell kill you
right after she kills me
as jenny loads up the back of the car with bags of groceries
patrick sitting in the cart looks off and points look
jenny turns and sees a bus with johns picture on the side an advertisement for his column
she watches it pass
i see him
and she goes back to loading the car
as jenny gently sets a sleeping conor in his crib
she quietly backs out of the room and shuts the door
as she peers in on patrick also napping in his room
as jenny comes in marley following and sits down heavily on the bed
she looks at marley as he lays down beside the bed
she now lays down and closes her eyes
a moment of peace
and then somewhere in the distance we hear a faint beep beep beep as some truck backs up
marley lifts his head perks up his ears and listens
please dont bark dog
please dont bark
beep beep and marley barks bolts out of the room
jenny opens her eyes with a start as marley runs barking through the house we hear something crash and break o
and now conors crying
as marley jumps up against the window and peers out
jenny comes into the room sees a lamp on its side a cushion torn open where marley now stands
she grabs him by the collar why do you do this
why do you wreck everything
she hauls her hand back to hit him but hesitates and just shoves him away from her and storms into the other room for conor
as john pulls up gets out of his car
we hear marley barking in the garage
as john comes in sees jenny sitting there on the couch
whys marley out in the i want that dog out of here
ill take him out
she looks up at him
i want you to get him out of here and keep him out of here
whatd he do i mean it john
i want him gone
i want him gone for good
a sad john posts a dog for sale sign
a co worker sign and smiles
that the dog in your column
obed ience school
necklace in the poop
john watches the guy walk off scribbles a new it up
this one reads e f d to good home
comes up to john
you giving up the dog
i thought yo u loved that thing
jenny wants him out
thats harsh man
i dont know what else to do
shes really unhappy
maybe the dog is just one too many things
theyre all unhappy
maybe youll get lucky and nobodyll want him
john just nods thinks about that
sebastian glances around then takes john aside
listen theres something i gotta tell you
im leaving the paper
i just gave arnie my notice
john looks over at arnies office the doors closed
hes not too happy about it
he called me an ungrateful quizzling and threw a stapler at me
you going over to the post
im going to new york
john doesnt move
the gray lady came courting last week
times im talking about the new york i know who youre talking about
you dont seem happy for me
im just in shock
i mean im in florida because of you
woodward and bernstein
that was the idea
yeah that was the idea before you decided to be the andy rooney of south florida
i didnt decide to be anything exactly
that hurts john
they stand there a moment considering each other then
look man youre happy doing your thing and im not trying to piss on that
i mean it youre good at it
i just wanted you to be the first to know
the house where john and jenny bought marley
lori the breeder looks at marley sitting in the front seat shakes her head sadly
marley he shooting draft as john posts some more flyers around the park
he drops a flyer and marley walking beside him starts to eat it
broward county dog rescue
a refuge for dogs
john fills out a form
give us weekend
up to you
john looks at the dogs in the back all of them trying to get his attention
john is working at his desk when arnie drops a few stacks of letters down
these are all responses to the column you wrote last week
john thinks a moment
one where you said you may have to give the dog away
looks at the letters oh
i assume they all want me to keep him
theyre all saying theyd take him
arnie moves on and john stares at the letters
john walks around the yard picking up marleys various toys putting them into a box
marley follows jumping up trying to get the toys back out of the box
john grabs a frisbee looks at the dog
you cant lo any more of these ok ay
because they s e re not gonna keep getting you more and i wont be there to look for them
he looks at marley standing there wagging his tail
youre gonna be fine alright
ill just be different
maybe e itll b better nobody poking your yanking your tail
could be better
jennys been watching
she stands there thoughtfully as john puts the frisbee in the box and resumes the hunt for the rest of marleys stuff the dog following him
jennys sitting on the bed waiting as john comes in
hes all packed up
patrick will want to say good bye but conors too young you cant do this
what do you mean
three days ago you were pretty clear i know but you cant do it
i wont let you
you cant give away marley
you told me you didnt want him around
the fact that you would have done something like that for me that you love me that much
well that blows me away
and were not doing this
it was wrong of me to ask
he comes over and sits down beside her
maybe not maybe marley is one thin too many
i got overwhelmed john
i mean be
one tells you how hard its gonna which part
all of it
being a parent
its the hardest thing in the world and no one prepares you for that
no one tells you how much you have to give up
i gave up so much of what makes me but im not allowed to say that
people think youre a bad person if you say that
but its how i feel sometimes and i need you to know that
its not your fault
its just something i have to figure out
but marley going that wont fix anything
nods then okay
she kisses him on the cheek then gets up and goes into the bathroom
he sits on the edge of the bed staring down the hall
to how theyve at the end of the hall panting oblivious both just been spared
john and jenny and marley and the two boys stroll
feels good to be out as a family again
marley wants to greet all the boca mini dogs as they are being walked or carried by their owners
jenny leans up against john
i made reservations at sunnys
thought we could all sit outside
takes his arm thank you
they are seated at an outside table shaded by a large round umbrella
john hooks marleys leash to two of the table legs as a waiter brings drinks
jenny holds up her beer
to a perfect day with my boys
a blonde boca trophy wife with a poodle on a jeweled leash shrieks excitedly as she meets up with another woman same type with another small fluffydog
the little dogs yip
camera booms down to underneath the table to marley who has spotted the poodles and is now locked and loaded
as suddenly their table suddenly leaps away from them and starts moving down the sidewalk crashing into other tables banging into waiters with trays making a terrible noise as it
scrapes over the faux italian paving stones
the four grogans sit facing each other across their drinks suddenly in their laps
marley is pulling the table like a dog with a sled towards the now terrified small dogs
he is chugging forward with every ounce of rippling muscle he has
john hurries after the dog jenny stays with the boys
marley he shooting draft
as marley with table approaches the small dogs they break free of their leashes and run
several innocent bystanders are knocked off their feet
theres a florist kiosk in the center of the plaza marley and table take out most of the merchandise
security guards look around wildly
its pandemonium but marley is in heaven
he makes a circuit of the entire plaz a one poor poodle runs for her life
finally back where marley started the terrified toy poodle leaps into jennys arms
marley tries to brake marley no
and suddenly he is jerked back
john has tackled the table marleys dragging
marley yelps and lands on his bac k then quickly rights himself tail wagging the happiest dog in the world
everyone surrounding them on the plaza has frozen silent
they all stare at marley and the grogans
the poodle jumps out of her arms and runs to its distraught owner
jennys head is in her hands her shoulders heaving
jen you okay
and she slowly looks up laughing uncontrollably her whole body racking tears in her eyes
her laughter becomes a baby crying and we now go to
as a newborn baby is placed on jennys chest
boys say hello to colleen
we pull back to reveal patrick now six and conor four standing beside the bed with john
they all crowd around mom as the nurse now takes a picture
on the flash we
john and the boys plant flowers in front of the house whilehead up like a marley chained to a post lies in the shade sphynx the baby colleen in a
portable bassinet beside him
jenny comes outside with some sodas for the boys
mom look what we did
as john comes inside and picks up the phone
as john comes back out of the house looking stunned
who was on the phone
she looks at him
theyre offering me a job
as a reporter
i guess the editor was down here on vacation read my stuff
whatd you say
i said thank you very much but im happy where i am
i mean its a big change florida to pennsylvania
yes it is
john smiles at her then goes to his sons
cmon guys back to work
she watches as he kneels down beside the boys resumes digging alongside them
john reads through a stack of letters
well thats part of the job
to get reader response
you notice any recurring themes the yeah
weve got a lot of cranks in broward county
including yi gu the last couple months
he flips through some
if he doesnt like it here he should move
more whining resident malcontent
is there anything good about florida according to mr
arnie im a commentator
weve got issues here
over crowding crime immigration tensions runaway florida hasnt soured john
i dont know
maybe its turning next week or maybe
maybe im sick of my column
i dont really think im all that interesting
are you kidding
youre the comic voice of south floridas middle class
youre a national treasure
well a regional treasure
municipal treasure for sure
youre just a little burned out
why dont you take a coupweeks off
consider it my birthday present
john pulls into the driveway gets out
john opens the door
he flicks on the lights and people shout surprise
there are banners hung from the ceiling reading happy th
jenny is standing there holding colleen
conor aged and patrick age run to their father
happy birthday honey
and he kisses jenny
hugs the kids
jenny watches him as he i en t e d distracted
shakes hands hugs their friends disor here
john closes john petsdthe dog rta es up g greets john
he looks at marley a moment then
hey buddy you and me are the same age
looks at marleys face you got more grey hair than me though
mind if i just hang here for a minute
and sits on the floor his back against the washing machine
as jenny brings in a cake with candles on it
john tries not to be too taken aback by the blaze
okay who wants to help me here
marley you too
jenny squats down with the cake and john and his kids start to blow out the candles
one two and then marley jumps the gun takes a huge bite of the cake lit candles and all
the guests have gone
john sits in a lounge chair holding out a fork so that marley can lick the cake off of it
most of the floating lights have gone out
jenny comes out
okay tell the truth were you really surprised
she sits down on his lap
you want your present
is it what you gave me last year
because that was real nice she hands him an envelope
he opens it pulls out an airline ticket
a plane ticket
so you can talk to the editor of the inquirer
that was months ago i called the editor last week
theyd still like to meet you
jenny i couldnt do that uproot us
weve got our friends the schools
first of all you dont even have the job yet its just an interview
second of all you dont have that many friends
what i was trying to say is that our life is here
baby i got news for you our life is wherever we are
and youre not happy here anymore doing that column
youre restless john
i feel it
i feel it when you read sebastians articles every day
and i feel it when you sit out in the driveway an extra five minutes before you come in
maybe its time for a change
im forty jen
seems kinda late for that
not so late
she stands up in the dark lifts her dress over her head
whatre you doing
were not old john
we can still surprise ourselves
he sits there stunned as she now dives into the pool
she surfaces and smiles at him
you want your other birthday present or not
john cant get out of his clothes fast enough
he leaps the pool and swims over to her kisses her
were not old
and then we hear another splash
and a moment later marleys head goes bobbing by
out of his as john packs up his desk
arnie sticks his head office
john smiles to himself walks over
i just wanted to say good luck up there
thank you sir
also theres a good chance that every piece of advice i ever gave you may in fact be total crap
i appreciate it just the same
they stand there a moment awkward
this would be where a mushier guy would tell you hes proud of you give you a hug and send you on your way
really glad youre not that guy sir
arnie nods goes back into his office and shuts the door
the grogans are in the back of the plane
through the window they can see marleys crate arriving at the plane on a luggage truck
marley is asleep heavily drugged
conor starts banging on the window
were up here
he cant hear you with the engine going
aside to jenny not to mention the tranquilizers
i think hes already reached his cruising altitude
the engines roar up and the stewardess begins her pre flight safety demonstration
john watches her smiling relieved they made it this far when he freezes
a muffled moan is coming from beneath his feet
clearly its marley
passengers near them frown
is that a dog
maybe i dont know
marleys our dog
hes with the suitcases
john smiles weakly at the passenger
what an imagination huh
we dont have a dog
he makes the crazy sign with his finger gesturing at patrick
the moaning gets worse
john just smiles tightly
beautiful picture perfect countryside
the grogan family car winds along the roads
marley has his head out the window tongue wagging
a two story country house no neighbors visible
trees land woodpile the whole country living thing
the grogans pile out of the car look at the house
marley takes off running
marley jumps into a pile of leaves scatters them everywhere rolls over onto his back and knocks over a rake which falls and breaks a basement window
as john is introduced to fellow staff and reporters most of them at least ten years younger than he is
hes shown his desk
john sits down at his cubicle stares out the window at the city
his editor black johns age approaches with a much younger reporter
settling in okay
im fine thanks
i want you to meet billy
he indicates the twenty something guy beside him
john and billy shake hands
billys gonna show you the ropes
youre the florida guy right
the dog columns
well some of them were but
cmon ill show you around
john wakes up
marley is whimpering at him
and then conor and patrick burst into the room
the family and marley trudge into the snow unused to their boots and snowsuits
marley jumps around barks like hes a puppy again
the kids slide down the hill in a toboggan
john is at the bottom to catch them
up at the house jenny calls
okay time for lunch
ill bring this in
go on up
the kids and marley head up to the house
john drags the toboggan up the hill
he pauses at the top and looks down at the toboggan run
he gets on the toboggan
honey whatre you doing
i cant remember the last time i rode on a toboggan
he starts sliding down the hill
marley runs for him as he builds up speed
but marley jumps onto johns lap as they get going
flying down the hill
marley is much heavier than the kids and they sail past the place where the kids stopped through the woods barely missing trees and low hanging branches john
the toboggan bumps over the crest of a small hill and sails through the air landing with a crash on the iced over creek
john and marley tumble into a snow bank on the opposite side
but then marley jumps up and wriggles in delight
john painfully unfolds himself checks for injuries
marley comes up and romps with him
wanna do it again
john shuts off all of the lights heads upstairs
we follow him up the stairs
he stops near the top peers through the bannister into
from the low angle of the stairs patrick lies on his side sleeping
and then we see marleys head rise and reveal itself as marley lifts it to look at john standing there
hed been laying there on the bed behind patrick
he looks at john knows hes not supposed to be there but
thats alright pal
i wont tell
we kicked ass down that hill didnt we
john smiles at him and continues up to bed
the snow has melted
marley still as a statue sits at the side of the road waiting
suddenly he stands up and starts to wag his tail
a moment later a yellow dot appears on the horizon
as it gets closer marley gets more and more excited as we now see that the dot is a school bus
it pulls to a stop beside marley
conor and patrick get off and are greeted by marley
we hold wide on their backs as the boys start up the road towards home marley bounding between them nipping at patricks backpack
john pulls up as the boys now throw a football back and forth while marley leaps into the air trying to intercept it
john gets out of the car claps his hands holds them up
hit me im open
patrick throws the ball to john who catches it mocks stiff arms his way to the front steps with the boys now hanging off him as he gives the play
my god look at grogan two three hundred pound linemen literally hanging off him but he wont be denied
and now marley jumps on them
ohhh out of nowhere a brutal hit from the strong safety and the unthinkable happens
grogan goes down
and he collapses with the boys at the foot of the
steps marley all over them licking whatever faces he can get
colleen comes out the front door stands at the top of the steps
mommy says dinner and take off your shoes
they all get up start up the steps
marley follows takes one step when his hind legs buckle
john looks back at him
you okay boy
marley tries the second step and again his legs give out
he looks up at them
whats wrong with him daddy
hes just tired
john sees the way patrick is looking at him knows hes protecting his little brother
football just took it out of him
cmon lets give him a hand
and now the three of them go to marley help him up the stairs
john sits across from the editor
too much color
yeah i mean dont get me wrong its a good piece but
youre reporting now john
i want you to tell the story i dont want you to be in the im pretty sure i dont mention myself the point is i still feel you in
john sits there thinking about that
all im saying is less you more facts
marley snores on the floor while john jenny and the kids all watch a movie together
suddenly they all take a whiff then wince at once
they all begin waving their hands in front of their faces
i think someone needs to go out
come on boy
marley gets to his feet follows john to the front door
rain falls as john opens the door and marley trots outside
as john comes back into the room a moment
its pouring out there
he grabs his slicker and heads back out
as john returns steps outside but marley is nowhere to be seen
john claps his hand and whistles
now jenny appears in the front door
hes not coming
john starts off into the dark
he cant be too far
as john trudges through the rain looking for the dog
jenny looks in the barn the garage
she looks at john comes into the kitchen without marley
him with concern
he start out of the room
hell show up
john is tucking the boys in
hes just out exploring
you know how much he likes the woods
bobby says dogs when theyre going to die they go away to do it
thats what his beagle did
and thats true
but not labs like marley
hes just out there making trouble somewhere
johns on the phone to neighbors
well if you see him
he hangs up goes to the window
im gonna get in the car maybe drive he sees something jenny
john and jenny run toa tree at the edge of the property
marley lies on the ground in a hollow hidden from view from the hill above
his belly is swollen his face drawn
its clear hes very ill
its okay boy its okay
john stands with dr
platt a female vet
marley lies on the floor in a dog bed an iv is going into his paw
hes on an iv for fluids and a sedative
so what happened
his stomach twisted
he ate or drank something quickly took in a lot of air and his stomach flipped
i got a tube down which let out some of the gas
i think i untwisted it
so hes okay
but once this happens it almost always happens again
and if it does theres not gonna be anything i can do
hes too old for that kind of surgery
what if it doesnt happen again
more than likely it will
but what if it doesnt
i just think you should prepare yourself that he might not make it through the night
maybe one percent of dogs ever survive one percent
whats that number based on
grogan ill tell you what its based on regular dogs
getting worked up lady we are so far from regular you have no idea
my guy here
he once ate an entire answering machine and digested it
then went back and ate the phone for dessert
so dont give me numbers like one percent because you dont know him
but i do and ill see him in the morning
we track with john as he storms out of the exam room walks down the hall goes through waiting room then he passes us as he goes out into the
dark parking lot walks to his car and stops
we stay behind him as he leans with one hand on his car and doesnt move
jennys sitting at the table looking through a thick album when john comes in
she looks up at him expectantly
were just gonna have to wait and see
if he makes it through the night i think well be alright
he notices the album
whatre you looking at
your old columns
hes in a lot of em
john rotates the album for a better look
you saved these
he looks up at her
even on the crappiest day when the boys were driving me nuts and the laundry wasnt done and a hundred other things were hard i knew i had this
taps the book five minutes of you
sometimes they were funny and sometimes they were sad or silly or whatever but they were all you
and for those five minutes you made me feel better
she gets up comes over to him leans down and kisses his head
then as she starts out
you should read them
theyre pretty great
the sun just coming up
we hear a phone ring over
as john his head on the table asleep pops up at the sound of the ring and grabs the phone
listens then alright
he hangs up sees jenny now standing in the doorway tying her robe looking at him anxiously
hes coming home
as john pulls up
he gets out of the suv walks around and opens the back window and now marley sits up into view
john opens the tail gate just as the kids come rushing onto the porch marleys tail wagging as hes lifted out of the car and set on the ground the
kids now surrounding him
full of unpacked boxes
a mattress on the floor
expensive electronics sit atop their cartons
john follows sebastian on a tour
how long you been here
two years little more
sebastian sees john looking at all of the unpacked boxes
im in and out of town so much i really havent had a chance to settle in
i hired a decorator but she and i got into a thing and it got messy right
i cant i still got one more interview to do
sebastian opens the fridge revealing nothing but beer and hunk of parmesan
whats the piece again

whatta you got five now

john pulls a photo from his wallet hands it to sebastian
jennys holding up
ignores the callowness yeah shes great
and thats colleen our youngest
whats with the ladybug get up
smiling at the memory oh yeah thats a funny story
she had done this pageant at her preschool two weeks before but she didnt wanna take off the costume plus marley went ballistic for the antenna which is why it
looks like hes trying to eat her head
yeah that is funny
returns the photo so i was thinking later on maybe thai
theres this new place in the meat packing district
hows that sound
be just like old times
john stands there a moment feeling the distance between them
uh well actually im headed back home later today
in fact i should probably get going
awkward man pat hug good seeing you man
walking him out oh hey be sure to check out the delegates lounge at the u
great mojitos really hot interpreters
thanks for the tip
and john goes out the door
sebastian takes out his blackberry dials
hey its sea bass
whatre you up to tonight
no thats cool
another time then
he hangs up stands there in the middle of his big empty apartment a moment
he then dials another number
hey its sea bass
whats going on
as a cab pulls away and john carries his suitcase up onto the porch
john enters the house sets down his suitcase
he sees a note picking up the kids
j and peers into where marley is up on his hind legs eating something off the counter
john puts his keys down but marley doesnt react
john sneaks up behind him
marley keeps eating the grilled cheese sandwich off the plate
marley looks up briefly as if he heard something but then returns to eating
john is right behind him
john reaches out and touches marley and marley jumps totally guilty
then he turns and greets john
whats the matter boy
you didnt hear me
he looks at the dog a moment thoughtful then
lets go for a walk
as john walks marley off leash up a hill
at one point john has to stop and wait for marley to catch up
come on boy just a little further to the top
marley comes up panting eyes wet and happy
john looks at him can see how tired he is
you know what this is a good spot right here
john looks out at the valley below settles down onto the damp earth beside marley
lets just sit for a while
the two of them sit there looking out at the beautiful countryside below
john strokes marley for a moment
looks at the grey hair the tired eyes that now look back at him
youre gonna tell me right
when its time
because i dont wanna make that decision on my own
so you just let me know when youre ready okay
marley rests his chin on johns arm
jenny is at the top of the stairs
turns to john have you seen him
hes not up here
john and jenny find marley lying peacefully in front of the dying fire
i guess i could move his bed down here
john sits down beside marley
hes always slept with us
now he cant even make it upstairs
he looks pretty comfortable to me
ill go get his bed
why dont you grab a blanket for me too
she nods starts back up the stairs
john grabs a pillow from the couch and lays down beside marley
this is a good spot
i may never sleep upstairs again
he looks up and see that jennys brought a blanket
she lies down with them
john puts his arm around them both
marleys tail begins gently pounding the floor
just like old times
john sits across from his editor
itd be twice a week
six hundred words
and whats the subject
the stuff we all go through
i dont get it
i thought you came here to be a reporter
i did but i think we both know that isnt me
im a columnist

a secretary sticks her head in the office
john your wifes on the phone
she says its important
ill be right there
to the editor think about it
jenny on the phone looking out into the backyard
i cant get him back inside
hes lying out there in cold
and he wont move
johns car pulls up
jenny and patrick are sitting on the floor
marley is lying on the dining room floor breathing heavily
patrick came home and we got him here
platt said if hes comfortable leave him here for a while and see
but hes no better
john kneels down by marley who looks at him but doesnt wag his tail or lick his hand
he runs his hand over his coat then over his stomach the dog flinches
im taking him in
the kids all come into the room colleen carrying a stuffed sheep
is he sick again
yeah he is honey
but im going to take him to the hospital and theyll try to make him better
conor bends down nuzzles marleys face
get better mar
you can take lamby okay
she puts the stuffed animal next to him but dont chew her other ear off
patrick leans down hugs marley tightly and whispers right in goodbye
when he looks up at his father john can see that patricks crying that he knows what the other two dont
john lifts marley out of the car
marley seems a little more alert
you wanna walk
he sets him down gingerly
hesitantly marley walks over to the tree that countless dogs have peed on sniffs it then looks around
john looks around too
its a crisp spring night in pennsylvania
takes a breath
nice night huh
marley looks around then looks at john
theres something in his expression
john nods knows what hes saying
as marley moves close okay
john his heart breaking bends down to carry marley up the front steps of the clinic
john stands as dr
platt comes out
i did everything that worked before
but no luck
theres still surgery not strong enough
theres blood in his stomach
the lining might be compromised
i dont know what well find if we go in there anyway
can you give me a minute
i need to
i need to call my wife
johns on his cell phone
its the stomach thing again
they could do surgery but
jenny listens to john on the phone
jenny nods as tears come
they stay on the phone quiet just being with each other
finally i love you john
i love you
marley is on the table zonked out
platt has put a blanket on the cold metal table so marley is warm
ill give you some time
john stares down at marley
takes the stuffed lamb out of his pocket places it under a paw
when john puts a hand on his flank marleys eyes flutter open
his tail thumps gently
he pets marleys head runs his hands all over marleys body
his coat still shedding
he takes up each paw each ear remembering and memorizing at the same time
he leans down puts his nose on marleys neck and breathes him in
then he goes around squats down so hes on marleys level
he looks into marleys eyes
listen you know all that stuff we always said about you
what a total pain you are
the worlds worst dog
well dont you believe it
dont believe it for a minute
you loved us every day no matter what
and thats a pretty amazing thing
he leans in
look i dont know where youre going from here but you remember this youre a great dog marley
you are a great dog
in the bedroom jenny sits on the bed the phone in her hand waiting we begin pulling away down the hallway
platt is in the room now
john his hand on one of marleys paws kneels on the ground looking at marley marley lays on the table looking right back at him
he wont feel a thing
hell just slip away
are you ready
looking at marley were ready
platt inserts the needle into the i
and presses the plunger
as a pajama clad patrick slips a tape into the vcr
as we now hold on marleys eyes slowly beginning to close
as jenny sits vigil by the phone we continue pulling back
as patrick sits alone in the dark living room his face illuminated by the tv as he watches silent images from grogan family home videos two year old patrick rides
on marleys back through the house at churchill young marleys tail knocking over everything within range toddler and dog both joyous
as marleys eyes finally close
the camera drifts to johns hand stroking marleys side
platt listens to marleys heart and says hes gone
from above the dog on the table the doctor discreetly going to the side and john laying his head next to marley and putting his arms around him as we
as the five grogans walk across the property
colleen sits on johns shoulders
they reach a clearing where we see a small grave has been dug
john sets colleen down
hes wrapped in his blanket
so hell be warm
you guys want to read your letters
mine is a picture
of me and marley
and ice cream
mommy wrote what i said
i will never forget you forever
and those are kisses
its beautiful honey
hell like it
drop it in
conor reads his piece of paper
i loved you all my life
i hope you like heaven and that theres lots to chew on
your brother conor richard grogan
john puts his hand on conors shoulder as conor drops in the letter into the grave
do you want to say anything
id like to give him something
jenny reaches behind her neck and unclasps the gold necklace john gave jenny when she first got pregnant
this little necklace has been on quite a journey
john smiles at her remembering
so much shared history
your dad gave this to me to celebrate the beginning of our family
but you know what
our family had already begun
she looks into the grave gently sets the necklace atop the blanket lets her hand rest there a moment then stands up
good bye clearance puppy
john puts few big stones on top of the tamped down earth
he sits on his haunches beside the grave looks up at the house across the yard
all lit up
we see the kids sitting by the fire while jenny moves about the kitchen getting dinner ready
john sits there watching them
watching his family
the family that both he and marley grew up in
he gives the fresh dirt a final loving pat and then as the last bit of sun goes down he stands up and heads for home
