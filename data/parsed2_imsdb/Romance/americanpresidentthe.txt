b if window
href b b screenplay by aaron sorkin as the opening tttles roll against a series of shots of statues and paintings of former presidents we hear shards of dialogue from
various presidential speeches
its an early november morning and the sun has just come over this extraordinary building
we hold on this for a moment before we a secret service agent presses the button by the private elevator as he talks into his shirt cuff
another agent rounds the corner into the corridor and is followed a step or two later by shepherds walking with his personal assistant janie a shy professional and incredibly efficient
the events been moved inside to the indian treaty room
to janie the is american fisheries
theyre giving you a pound halibut
janie make a note
we need to schedule more events where somebody gives me a really big fish
janie starts to make a note
janie i was kidding
of course sir
to the agent at the elevator hey cooper
shepherd and janie enter the elevator
as the doors close
rothschild asked to have a moment with you this morning
is he upset about the speech last night
he seemed concerned
well it wouldnt be a monday morning unless lewis was concerned about something i did sunday night
the elevator doors open revealing lewis rothschild
at lewis is the presidents chief domestic policy advisor
it would appear that he averages about two hours sleep a night though that doesnt seem to slow him down
you skipped the whole paragraph
to janie and monday morning it is
lewis falls into the pace as the three of them head for the double doors leading to the south lawn
american can no longer afford to pretend that they live in a great society
and then nothing
you dumped the whole handguns paragraph
this is a time for prudence lewis
that was the kick ass section
the three of them are now outside and making their way down the covered walkway that runs from the east wing to the west wing
i thought what with being the president and all
sir of course i didnt mean to imply i thought youd be turning cartwheels this morning lewis percent job approval
thats great news sir but
they walk past a groundkeeper whos at work at a patch of grass
before hes even completed the last syllable of the greeting janie quickly and quietly said charlie
sir the press is gonna need an explanation
shepherd lewis and janie walk through the door being held open by an agent
the conversation continues as they make their way through the corridors of they walk quickly down a hallway teeming with staffers aides because you dropped the whole kick ass section
now weve got this thing hanging out there
theres a thing hanging out there
americans can no longer afford to pretend that they live in a great society
so now its just this thing
and its hanging out there
shepherd stops at an open doorway calls to a staffer maria good morning sir
did they tell you im gonna need overall consumer spending and not just first homes
well have it for you in minutes
shepherd moves on
lewis and janie stay with him
president i really feel we need to focus on
lewis however much coffee you drink in the morning i want you to reduce it by half
i dont drink coffee
then hit yourself over the head with a baseball bat would you please
another staffer crosses their path happy birthday laura
hey laura happy birthday
thank you sir
once out of earshot to janie i should send her some flowers
you already did sir
and with that they walk through a doorway and into in the outer office mrs
chapil the presidents secretary is hard at work on a word processor
she stands as shepherd walks in good morning mr
howre you mrs
fine thank you sir
kodak left the detailed breakdown of the approval poll for you
he seemed to indicate that it was very good news
sixty three percent of it at any rate
and by now theyre in the oval office itself
shepherd has gone to his desk and is looking over the various overnight briefing memos that have been left for him
as someone used to doing six things at once he has no trouble reading listening and talking at the same time
lucy called just a moment ago
you forgot to sign her permission slip for her class the museum trip
ill go get it
to janie what time does she get home today
hows my afternoon look
schedule some time for me at
buenos dias senor presidente
this from robin mccall a strikingly tall black woman and the presidents press secretary as she strides into the room
too tall mccall how was mexico
i didnt truly appreciate it until i came back and discovered that america isnt a great society
to robin he dumped a whole section
now theres a thing hanging out there
not a great society sir
well with you out of the country it wasnt robin
now that youre back were great again
theres a press room full of people saying what did he mean by that
re a memo hes been looking at a
did you get one of these
this is said to a
macinerney as he walks through a separate entrance on the left side of the room
in addition to being the presidents chief of staff and closest advisor hes the presidents closest and oldest friend
is that the letter from solomon at the gdc
it would appear to be a letter from the entire environmental community
these people are outta control
i think theyre just frustrated mr
are they blaming the president for global warming
well they dont think he caused it if thats what you mean
continuing to shepherd sir im on the phone with these people twice a week
i honestly dont know what they want at this point
what they want is a percent reduction in fossil fuel emissions
it wont pass at percent
we havent really tried
lewis mcsorley mccluskey and shane hold too many markers
if we try to push this through and lose there will be a very loud thud when we hit the ground and thats not what you want in an election
talk to the gdc again a
tell them the president resents the implication that hes turned his back on the environment
tell them ill send to the floor
but were gonna ask for a percent reduction
if they want to pull their support fine
at percent job approval rating
i dont need their help getting a bill passed
we gotta get going wheres leon
to an aide would you call mr
kodak and tell him the presidents a
s sentence is cut short by the sound of a head on pedestrian collision in the outer office aaagh
sorry my fault
to the aide never mind
leon kodak comes into the oval office
the white house pollster is a likable if clumsy numbers whiz
he along with a
lewis and robin are regarded as the presidents starting team
the people in this room have grown very close over the past few years
good morning mr
you all right
they keep moving that big ficus plant
were all here mr
first i wanted to say congratulations
three years ago we were elected to the white house by one of the narrowest margins in history and today kodak tells us percent of registered voters think were doing
a good job
wait a second
you wanted me to poll registered voters
even shepherd smiles
but the poll also tells us what we already knew we dont get this crime bill of ours through congress and these numbers are gonna be a memory
so starting today were shifting it into gear
can i tell my morning press gaggle that gun control crime control robin
gun control means were wimps and were soft on crime
hang on are we not lewis are we not putting back the handgun restrictions
were leaving em out
sir we campaigned on this issue
now i understand we took it out when we were in the low forties but we can push it through now
after the elections
sir we may never have an opportunity like this again
lets take this percent out for a spin and see what it can do
we cant take it out for a spin lewis
we need it to get re elected
for reasons passing understanding people do not relate guns to gun related crime
robin you can brief the press this afternoon
as of today the crime bills priority one on the presidents domestic agenda
leon youre gonna run the war room
were gonna need detailed projections for all the target districts by the end of the week
and leon dont be a nice sweet guy from brooklyn
do what the n
scare the shit out of em
i can do that
lewis we want you to be legislative liaison on this
youre gonna run the show on the hill
can i just say to return to the subject for one moment that it might be easier to fight a war on drugs if we werent arming drug dealers
shepherd responds a little too quickly we see a spark of a temper
lewis weve gotta fight the fights we can win
we want to announce the crime bill at the state of the union which is days from today
the last nose count put us votes short
eighteen votes in days
thank you everyone
janie whats next
thank you mr
the meetings over
lewis robin and kodak say their thank you mr
president s as they exit
security briefing sir
its around oclock the same morning as the capital district in its own way is showing signs of the approaching thanksgiving and christmas holidays
on the seventh floor of the building
a receptionist tells us where we are by answering the phone global defense council
you wanted to see me
i just got off the phone with a
leo a white haired man in his early s is meeting with susan sloan a ish lawyer who seems to go out of her way to create an issue where
did the president read the letter
the presidents pissed as hell susan
that letter was a stupid move
it was aggressive and we should stand by every this isnt the guy who needed us four years ago susan
hes incredibly popular
hes gonna win re election in a walk and he could give a shit what we stand by
if the president passes the most important piece of environmental legislation in history and does it despite our negative endorsement our political weight in the future will rank somewhere below
the save the spotted owl society
beat im bringing in some help
we dont need another environmental expert to confirm what every other environmental expert not an environmental expert a professional political strategist
were playing hardball with andrew shepherd and we need a heavy bat
sydney ellen wade
that woman doesnt know the first thing about the environmental lobby
shes a closer susan
she gets the job done
shepherd and lewis working on a speech
try it like this and lose that
entering david sasser from the times called and wanted to know what the white house felt was a great society
what did you tell him
i told him i couldnt speak for the president but for my money bermuda
janie steps in mr
president your cousin judiths come down with the flu and wont be able to join you thursday night
thats too bad
remind me to give her a call later
you gonna go stag
thats not a problem
weve never gone wrong parading you around as the lonely widower
the words came out casually but they instantly freeze everyone
continuing my god
beat i cant believe i said that
president that was an incredibly thoughtless remark
i would never dream of insulting you or the memory of your wife
thats okay forget it
to janie what time is it
im gonna go over and say hi to lucy
you have the attorney general at and the trade representative at
somewhere in there you promised npr five minutes
president robin dont worry about it
we hear the sound of a trombone being played not well from one of the rooms
shepherd comes around and down the corridor
he walks into lucy shepherds year old daughter stops playing
no keep going
i liked what you were playing
whats it called
you play it with gusto
are my lips swollen
are they supposed to be
then youre doing fine
whatcha got behind your back
a little gift
is it a dirt bike
he hands her an old textbook
is it a really old seventh grade textbook of yours that youre gonna make me read cover to cover and discuss at dinner and drive me crazy with
im not comfortable with the really old part but everything else you said was true
reading the cover understanding the constitution
your social studies teacher said your class would be starting on the constitution this week
you talked to mr
its called a parent teacher conference
linder and i were the key player in that discussion
why dont you like social studies luce
i like it fine dad
all your other teachers say youre happy youre enthusiastic youve always got your hand up
linder says you dont participate unless he calls on you and even then its a one word answer
i dont know what to say dad
i guess im just not
i dont know
luce take a look at this book
this is exciting stuff
its about who we are and what we want
read what it says on the first page
reading property of gilmore junior high school
the next page
reading we the people of the united states in order to form a more perfect union
grabs you right off the bat
its a page turner
i cant wait
good cause its possible the subject might come up at dinner tonight
do you see it as part of your job to torture me
no its just one of the perks
see you tonight
he gives her a kiss on the head and heads out the door
behind him he hears lucys rendition of hail to the chief
shepherd shoots her a look as we where shepherd is finishing a meeting with the defense secretary chairman of the joint chiefs and a national security advisor each of whom
is accompanied by at least one deputy or aide
is also present
the c stad hardwares been in place for a month
weve got instructors from the army air defense school waiting to go down and train the israelis
how soon can you deploy them
we can airlift em in the morning
theyll have c stad operational in days
any security concerns
if anybody wanted to hit it theyd have hit it by now
lets move on it
thank you gentlemen
shepherd and a
leave the cabinet room amidst a volley of good bye s and thank you mr
they pass mrs
chapil and janie
continuing have a good evening mrs
you too mr
shepherd starts his walk from the west wing back to the residence
it is the exact reverse of the path he took to the oval office in the morning
ill see you in the morning janie
you will mr
a secret service agent follows at a distance
sotto liberty is moving
leo solomon brought in a hired gun at the gdc
its about time
shes a lawyer from virginia named sydney ellen wade
i know this woman well
shes had a lot of success getting congressmen elected
maybe we should try to steal her
ten percent a
dont let them leave the room till theyre clear about that
you know if youve got a free second maybe you could stop in and say hello
it might smooth the way
mention it to janie
then lets clear this off the table and get everybody focused on the crime bill
i dont want to win this
i want to win it by a couple of touchdowns
we will mr
starts to leave
shepherd stops him
listen robin said something to me today that im sure she wouldnt have said it if
i mean she wasnt saying it to me i realize
beat ah never mind
have a good night
good night mr
when were out of the office and were alone you can call me andy
i beg your pardon
i mean you were the best man at my wedding for crying out loud
call me andy
laughing off the suggestion whatever you say mr
they have reached the south entrance to the white house
continuing have a good night sir
good night a
shepherd enters the white house
its early morning of the following day and the grounds outside are in full swing
in front of the guardhouse susan and her new colleague sydney ellen wade are being cleared
to the guard hi my names sydney ellen wade
he just needs your drivers license
susan hands the guard her license
handing him her license im from virginia
he doesnt care
to the guard im here for a meeting with mr
he doesnt need to know that
the guard buzzes her through the gate
to the guard forgive me this is my first time at the white house
im trying to savor the capra esque quality
he doesnt know what capra esque means
to susan yeah i do
frank capra great american director its a wonderful life mr
smith goes to washington
handing sydney and susan their laminated passes sydney ellen wade of virginia
knock em dead
sydney and susan begin to walk up the path toward the entrance to the west wing
a meeting with the education secretary the hud secretary several aides and lewis is breaking up
shepherd is ushering people out
the day the government starts subsidizing private schools is the day we give up on public education
i know the proposal only scratches the surface but its the least we can do
were already doing the least we can do but i cant think of anything better so well go with this for now
to hud secretary jerry say hello to linda for me
and if i dont see you again have a good thanksgiving
thank you mr
the room has cleared
janie is arranging new papers on the presidents desk
howre we doing
youre running four minutes ahead of schedule
exited janie this is unprecedented
i dont know what to do with myself
macinerney asked me to remind you to pop your head in on the gdc meeting
s office day your concerns are not falling on deaf ears
the environmental lobby has known no greater alley in the white house than president shepherd
hardly an impressive distinction a
susan is trying to avert the inevitable sydney we should leave mr
macinerney alone now
hes already given us more time than susan mr
macinerney doesnt want us to leave because mr
macinerneys not yet done what he needs to do today
wades been thrown into the deep end of the pool on her first day
she hasnt even had a chance to read the report of the quebec conference
sydney whose brain is telling her to slam on the brakes check her swing smile and leave the building decides instead to hit the gas and swing away
the others are watching this as if they were watching the evolution of a train wreck
i havent read it
if someone had asked me yesterday id have told them the quebec conference was made up of six professional hockey teams
but what i do know is that its time for the president to run for president again
leon kodak is as good as it gets when it comes to electoral strategy and im certain hes told the president exactly what id tell him nail down michigan and
california where they make cars and airplanes and burn plenty of fossil fuel
but if i had read these eight hundred pages i would have discovered that its the burning of fossil fuels thats been mostly responsible for global warming and that the
percent reduction recommended by the gdc is a necessary first step toward arresting the catastrophic greenhouse effect that has gone unchecked by this administration
to sydney its really time to susan i promise you the white house chief of staff will not let us leave here until hes broken the bad news
no one in the room really understands whats going on
who would like to take the time to admire sydney but of course cant
pause im afraid sydneys right
although not about michigan and california
the president has asked me to convey to you that hes sending his energy bill to the floor with a call for a reduction of percent
theres an uncomfortable silence in the room
continuing the president is willing to go it alone on this but hes asking for and frankly hes expecting the full support of the gdc
the presidents expecting our full support
yes he is
the presidents dreamin a
the president has critically misjudged reality
if he honestly thinks that the environmental community is going to whistle a happy tune while rallying support around this pitifully lame mockery of environmental leadership just because hes a
nice guy and hes done better than his predecessors then your boss is the chief executive of fantasyland
lets take him out back and beat the shit out of him
sydneys blown out her speakers because shes turned in the direction of the private office entrance to see live and in person the president of the united states
she is frozen
if she were capable of thought process she would be preying for something heavy to fall on her head right now
good morning mr
how are you today
couldnt be better
to the group i apologize for the interruption but a
asked me to stop and say hello
you wouldnt be sydney ellen wade by any chance would you
dont know what to say
all evidence to the contrary
president we havent met
my name is susan sloan
i used to work with congressman myers
i hope this episode in no way sydney
you got a second
quietly of course
sydney gets up to leave
shepherd escorts her out of a
s office and into the hallway
i thought maybe we might have a word in private
someplace a little less intimidating
to sydney this is my personal assistant janie basdin
janie would you show ms
wade into the rec room
ill be there in a second
shepherd enters a doorway off of the hall
sydney continues down the hallway
to sydney this way
janie leads sydney into
where sydney just stands uncomfortably not knowing whether to sit or stand
trying the way a jumper on a window ledge tries not to look down trying not to notice things like the jfk desk the seal of the president of the
united states the bust of lincoln
shepherd strides in sorry to keep you waiting
president is it okay if i call you sydney
president have you ever been in the oval office
ive just been on the regular tour
it didnt include
i hear its pretty good
president what you saw in there was nothing more than vanity run amok
i was showing off for a colleague who doesnt think very much of me
itd be a real injustice for you to hold the gdc accountable for my behavior today
on top of which im monumentally sorry for having insulted you like that
are you under the impression that im mad at you
sydney seldom does a day go by that im not burned in effigy
not by a professional political operative standing feet from the oval office
no ill give you that
president did you know that when the city planners sat down to design washington d
their intention was to build a city that would intimidate and humble foreign heads of state
i didnt know that
the white house has the single greatest home court advantage in the modern world
learned that one the hard way
sydney this bill is important to me
yes sir ill convey your message
but you dont believe me
the gdc is asking for percent sir
its not gonna pass at percent
its a long shot at
how do you know that until you put the full weight of the white house behind sydney at percent we are votes shy in the house
it cant be done
but i tell you what
ill make you a deal with you
if you can get votes ill get you the last
twenty four votes
if you can swing votes by the state of the union ill promise you full white house support
do i have your word on that sir
listen are you hungry
i skipped breakfast
you wanna have some coffee
a donut or something
sir im a little intimidated by my surroundings and yes ive gotten off to a rocky and somewhat stilted beginning but dont let that diminish the weight of my message
the gdc has been at every president for the last decade and a half that global warming is a calamity the effects of which will be second only to nuclear war
the best scientists in the world have given you every reason to take the gdc seriously
but im gonna give you one more
if you dont live up to the deal you just made come new hampshire were gonna go shopping for a new candidate
sydney heads for the door you cant do that sydney
with all due respect mr
president whos gonna stop me
well if you go through that door the united states secret service
thats my private office
pointing you need to go out that way
sydney with as much dignity as she can muster leaves the oval office
shepherd muses about what has just transpired
shepherd has converted one of the rooms on the second floor residence
his expert shot demonstrates that playing pool is something he does almost as well as being president
stands to the side with his pool cue
mcsorley mccluskey and shane know were making our move on the crime bill
theyre circling the wagons on the assault weapons
should i meet with them
let lewis take a pass at them first
in the side
shepherd sends the two ball flying into the corner pocket
nice shot mr
nice shot mr
you wont call me by my name when were playing pool
assesses the table
i will not do it playing pool i will not do it in a school i do not like green eggs and ham i do not like them sam i
at ease a
and get away from the pocket
in the corner
shepherd makes the shot
leo solomon phoned
he said he was thrilled with the deal you made this morning
shepherd lifts his cue for a moment
trying to think it there was something he was supposed to tell a
i forgot to tell you
its a waste of time
not our time
gdc makes a big push for the votes and when they come up short we move in with the softer bill to get passed were everybodys hero
in the side
also sydney wade called
shepherd a hair too excited by this news misses by a mile
beat she wanted to apologize one more time for her behavior
in the side
did she say anything about me
beat sydney wade
when she called
did she say anything about you
in the corner
no its just that we had a nice couple of minutes together
she threatened me and i patronized her and we didnt have anything to eat but i thought there was a connection
is staring at him in disbelief
she didnt say anything about me
quietly well no but i could pass her a note before study hall and tell me this hypothetically what would happen i feel a nightmare coming on
in the corner
he misses the shot
if i called sydney and asked her to be my date at the state dinner thursday night
youre not serious
dont i sound serious
the president cant just go out on a date
youre not wilson was widowed during his first term
he meets a woman named edith gault
he dated her courted her married her and somewhere in there managed to form the league of nations
president this is an election year
if youre looking for female companionship we can make arrangements thatll insure total privacy and i dont want you to get me a girl a
what is this vegas
no sir this is the white house
and im talking about something that in no way is at conflict with my oath of office
im a single adult and i met a woman that id like to see again socially
hows that different from what wilson did
the difference is he didnt have to be the president on television
youve said it a million times if there were a television set in every living room years ago this country does not elect a man in a wheelchair
what are you saying
well take a hit
i dont know
five points were standing here talking about
it could be more
i drop five points when wisconsin doesnt make it to the rose bowl
in the corner
do you want me to have kodak put together some numbers so we know what were talking about
i dont want to check a polling sample to see if this is okay like im asking permission to stay out an hour past curfew
this isnt the business of the american people
president the american people have a funny way of deciding on their own what is and what is not their business
i like her a
pause stop being my chief of staff for one minute
beat give her a call
calling out janie
she didnt say anything about me
she said youre taller than she thought youd be
janie enters yes sir
i need you to track down a phone number
lined with red brick three story walk ups
a few suitcases and two or three moving cartons serve as evidence that sydneys staying with her sister beth temporarily
beth still in hospital scrubs from a hour shift opens a bottle of wine while sydney in a bathrobe and wet hair tries to get off the phone
into phone richard
richard it wasnt funny
i acted like a college freshman at a protest rally
tell him the part about walking out the wrong door
oh god i forgot about that
back into phone no richard
richard i dont want to hear your andrew shepherd imitation
i wanna hear it
im hanging up now richard
i was gonna go to bed early and wake up when theres a new president
she hangs up
continuing the president must think im a third rate jerk
if he thinks youre a jerk im sure he thinks youre a first rate jerk
ill tell you one thing boy
i regrouped you gotta gimme that
i pulled it together at the end
i stood in the middle of the oval office and i made it very clear that from now on he who doesnt take the gdc seriously does so at his
and then you walked out the wrong door
are you gonna be throwing that back at me the rest of my life
thats my current plan yes
the telephone rings
thats gonna be leo solomon
he said hed call at nine
sydney picks up the phone continuing into phone hello
uh hi is this sydney
sydney doesnt recognize the voice into phone leo
no this is andrew shepherd
sydney looks at beth and rolls her eyes then explains to her andrew shepherd
back in the phone youre hilarious richard
youre a regular riot
and we cross cut between sydney and shepherd
this isnt richard its andrew shepherd
well im so glad you called because i forgot to tell you today what a nice ass you have
im also impressed that you were able to get my phone number considering i dont have a phone
good night richard
sydney hangs up the phone
as shepherd undaunted dials the number again
under his breath this used to be easier
as the phone rings
i dont believe this
you want me to deal with him
i may choke in front of shepherd but richard reynolds i can handle
she picks up the phone
and we begin cross cutting again between the two
are you learning impaired
listen do me a favor
hang up the phone
hang up the phone
when you get the white house operator give her your name and tell her you want to speak to the president
shepherd hangs up
sydneys still holding the phone and seems a little confused
an emotion which is about to be replaced by horror as the unbelievable into the reality
to herself this isnt happening to me
whats going on
to herself its not possible i did this twice in one day
the operator answers
filtered good evening the white house
continuing filtered hello
quietly my names sydney ellen wade
id like to filtered the presidents expecting your call maam
ill put you right through
hes just opened a bottle of beer when the phone rings
he picks up the phone hello
president im sure theres an appropriate thing to say at this moment
probably some formal apology for the nice ass remark would be in order
i just dont quite know how to word it
its my fault
i shouldnt have called you at home
should i call you at the office tomorrow
no sir of course not
i mean yes you can call me anytime you want this is fine
right now is fine
when i said of course not i meat that
you know what
the hell with it im moving to another country
smiling what did you mean when you said you dont have a phone
i just moved to washington over the weekend and my apartment isnt ready yet
this is my sisters apartment
come to think of it how did you get this number
beat how did i get the number
thats a reasonable question
i dont know
probably the fbi
trying to pretend its just another guy on the phone the fbi
cause i if you want to find someone and youre the president thats who you would call
you know who else is good at that
well yeah but i was thinking of the internal revenue service
they have computer files that
i should stop stalling
as im sure you know the french have elected themselves a new president and were having a formal state dinner at the white house and i was wondering and youre
under no obligation at all but i thought it might be fun
i was wondering if you maybe wanted to go
with me and uh
there it is
thats why i was calling
theres a long silence on the phone
sydney congress doesnt take this long to the president has asked me to join him in representing our country
im equal to the task
and i wont let you down sir
beat sydney this is just a dinner
were not gonna be doing espionage or anything
im a little
what do i do
i i mean where do i go
should i meet you
im gonna have a very nice woman named marsha bridgeport call you
shes the white house social director and shell help you with anything you want
now when she calls you and tells you her name is marsha bridgeport itll help if you give her the benefit of the doubt
ill see you thursday night
president thank you for asking me
this is a first for me
they hang up
a large conference room at oeob has been converted for the use of a half dozen staffers as well as ten or twelve interns some of them high school age
a sign on a corkboard reads votes in days
the two numbers are written on two separate pads of paper so that the top sheets can be torn off to reveal the following numbers in descending order
there is also a bulletin board that lists every member of the house of representatives and is divided up into five columns for leaning towards undecided leaning against and against
whos on indiana
raising his voice excuse me
new people i cant remember your names
raise your hand if youre on indiana
two interns raise their hands continuing put your hands down youre on illinois
lewis comes in
weve got jarrett
i dont believe it
to an intern you
jarrett democrat minnesota

to lewis we just had his name laminated under undecided
howd you get the fence pole out of his butt
i wish i could take credit
he just said lewis i support the president a hundred percent
not the bill the president
were gonna win this in a walk
its like a kissing booth at a carnival
give us a vote get a photo op with number
lewis reaches to the tote board and pulls the off revealing
we should have gone after the handguns
we gotta do one thing at a time
we dont have time to do one thing at a time
a gdc conference room that sydney her assistant david and two interns have made into their day headquarters
a similar tote board reads votes in days
the two interns are marking spreadsheets
david is on one phone sydney is on another
into phone carol its david in sydney wades office
i want to confirm her lunch with the congressman
into phone we could do with a little party leadership mike

congress is in session right im not wrong about that
lisa another intern is hanging up a phone in the background and crossing to the corkboard
i just got off with luther simons
brocks on board
she rips the off making it
sydney reaches for her coffee and knocks over a cup of pencils
in righting the pencils she knocks over her coffee
youre awfully jumpy today
what do you have a big date tonight
with that a big pile of papers is sent flying off the desk
its a beautiful night
the white house lit up and shimmering in its golden glow would appear now to be exactly what the poet was looking at when he described the shining city on
limousines several of which fly the flag of foreign diplomats pull up one by one their doors opened by white gloved marines
white lights from television cameras mix with the fireworks of flashbulbs from the print media
the guests of whom there are a couple hundred in black tie and evening gowns are entering the receiving area
all this happening of course under the eye of the secret service agents both american and french who are strategically placed throughout
the light from a tv camera comes on as a reporter begins a quick stand up interview with robert rumson a handsome man in his late forties
to the camera im standing here with senate minority leader robert rumson just one of the many guests arriving at what for a few hours at least is a non
partisan white house
senator the latest public opinion survey shows the president with approval ratings that would make him all but unbeatable come next november
is there a republican who can mount a serious challenge and are you that candidate
lloyd its a long time till next november
right now im just looking forward to a pleasant evening
lucy is standing behind her father tying his bow tie
thats a little tight luce
its supposed to be tight
its supposed to make you look regal
is it supposed to cut off the blood flow to my face
he looks in the mirror
where did you learn how to do this
smiles really where did you learn
i dont know
i just guess
sweetie did mom teach you how to do this
pause lucy is this okay with you
my having dinner with a woman
its totally okay
are you sure
because if you want to talk about it
dad its cool
go for it
you know im a little nervous
youll be fine
just be yourself
and compliment her shoes
girls like that
dressed in formal but not festive clothes and holding as always her notepad janie waits by the door
a secret service agent sits alone behind a small desk
the door opens and sydney walks in
shes needless to say stunning
the president wants you to join him upstairs in the residence
may i show you the way
this formal reception area is filled with special guests
as sydney walks in a
goes to her immediately
sydney come on in
you look beautiful
i have no idea what im doing here
i promise you theres no hidden agenda
shepherd approaches sydney
we spoke on the phone
esther macinernery a
s wife joins them
you know my wife esther
its nice to see you again
affectionately sydney the president told me about how you two met
i think its priceless
i dont know what happened
one minute i was calling him a mockery of an environmental leader
the next minute i had a date
men like being insulted by women
it makes them feel loved
dont ask me why
sydney when you meet the french president dont make him feel too loved all right
we just signed a new trade agreement
the french president dastier and his wife approach
to dastier mr
president would allow me to introduce sydney ellen wade of the commonwealth of virginia
sydney this is president rene jean dastier and his wife monique danielle dastier of france
an honor to meet you both
president im sorry to interrupt
the receiving line is in place
sydney it sounds like our tables ready
shepherds guests make their way out of the residence leaving shepherd with sydney and the french president and shepherd and sydney are walking down the staircase that leads to the
red carpeted hall through which the president enters the east room
the group escorting the president gives them wide berth so that the two of them can have some privacy
once we hit the bottom of the stairs i gotta do a thing
youll be escorted
they took me through it
after a slight pause continuing do you do this often sir
beat this is actually only our second state dinner
the first was for the emperor of japan who died shortly after that so we stopped having them for a while just in case
i meant do you go out on
do you often do you do i date a lot
how bout you
lately i seem to be going out on a lot of first dates
then youre experienced at this
oh yeah you can ask me anything
how are we doing so far
its hard to say at this point
so far its just your typical first date stuff
and all of a sudden an incredible sound from inside the east room the marine corps brass and percussion ensemble plays four ruffles and flourishes
and i wanted to find a way to be different from the other guys
a booming voice over the p
announces ladies and gentlemen the president of the united states
and now the whole walk timing out with incredible precision by the way nice shoes
shepherd walks into the hall as the brass and percussion ensemble plays hail to the chief
the guests come to their feet and applaud long and loud
the group following the president catches up to the spot where sydney has stopped walking
they all join in the applause
we can see in sydneys face that shes been quite swept up
the room is beautifully appointed with the marine corps dance band playing dinner music and the secret service strategically positioned
stewards are clearing away the main course and refilling wine glasses
in addition to the two main couples and esther macinerney and two other couples are seated at the presidents table
president the president and mrs
dastier look bored
theyre not talking to anybody
esther do you speak french
i thought you spoke french
great next time julius caesar comes to town youre our gal
sydney i dont suppose that you speak any taking over to dastier monsieur le president nous sommes tous habilles nous avons ce merveilleux orchestre une piece magnifique
comment se fait il que les invites ne dansent pas
proudly to a
and esther thats my date
je ne connais pas la tradition en amerique mais dans mon pays si les invites de louis xvi et marie antoinette avaient ose danser devant le roi et la reine
ils auraient perdu la tete
sydney you didnt dissolve the nato treaty did you
i just said that were sitting in this beautiful room listening to the music of this wonderful orchestra and i wondered why nobody was dancing
and i informed ms
wade that in my country a guest at the palace of louis xvi and marie antoinette would soon find their head in a guillotine if they made the impertinent gesture
of dancing without so much as a by your leave from the king and the queen
ill bet no one accused louis of being soft on crime
theres a lesson there mr
more beheadings at the white house
bob rumson would embrace it
im sure he would but i have a better idea
shepherd stands holds out his hand to sydney
continuing would you like to dance
uh yeah i guess
i mean yes sir id love to
shepherd and sydney move to the dance floor accompanied by the appreciative ooohs and ahhs of the guests
the dance band begins and sydney and shepherd dance
each and every one of them have stopped all conversation and are fixating on this captivating sight
as we go around the room we can observe the subtle reactions of at first various anonymous guests then holding hands smiling as they watch their old friend and we
where the minority leaders game face can barely conceal the gears that have slowly begun to turn in his head as we i dont know how you do it
thats not what i mean
two hundred pairs of eyes are focused on you right now with two questions whos this girl and whys our president dancing with her
first of all the pairs of eyes arent focused on me
theyre focused on you
and the answers are sydney ellen wade and because she said yes
looking on from the back of the room
they make a nice couple
weve got troubles
as people start onto dance floor we as it pulls away from the white house and into the night
in the back sydney slips a shoe off and rubs her foot
she smiles then turns around to look out the back window as the white house slips out of view
chapil and janie are at their respective desks as shepherd walks in
good morning mrs
good morning mr
rothschild and miss mccall are in the office sir
they said they needed to speak with you before scheduling
janie can you get me the number of a local florist

he heads into the office
where lewis and robin are waiting anxiously
president we need five minutes before scheduling if you can spare it
to robin i just need two minutes to make a call and ill be right with you
janie enters and hands shepherd a piece of paper
continuing thank you janie
who are we calling sir
im calling the organization of the united brotherhood of its none of your damn business lewis
ill be with you in a minute
lewis and robin exit the oval office
shepherd picks up the phone
to the operator yeah good morning
how do i get an outside line
shepherd dials the phone number janies given him
lewis and robin hovering near the outer office
whats the president doing
im sorry im really not at liberty to say
into phone tell me something
what is the state flower of virginia
does this have something to do with sydney wade
im really not at liberty to say
into phone is there someone else there who might know
beat no im not trying to five you a hard time i was hold on please
shepherds voice comes through on intercom
through intercom janie whats the state flower of virginia
turning to mrs
state flower of virginia
through intercom the dogwood sir
to janie thank you
into phone its the dogwood
hold on please
to janie through intercom janie the dogwood is a tree not a flower
leon kodak walks by
its a tree and a flower
are you sure
whats going on
through intercom sir its a tree and a flower
into phone the dogwood is both a tree and a flower
id like a dozen please
how bout roses
two dozen roses
janie im the president senior domestic policy advisor
its important that i have a full understanding of janie
do you have any idea where my credit cards might be
theyre in storage in wisconsin with the rest of your personal items
into phone listen what might be better is if you just bill me for the flowers
im sure itll be okay with your boss
well i dont know if you recognize my voice but this is the president
beat the united states
theyve hung up hello hello
leo you wanted to see me
so there i was thinking maybe i should give sydney a call
shes new in town doesnt know many people
leo produces a copy of the morning paper which has a photo of shepherd and sydney dancing
leo then i picked up the times it was crazy
he called me at home
whats going on
it was innocent
his cousin got the flu at the last minute
did you sleep with him
did you sleep thats none of your business leo
yeah it is sydney
you wanna tell me how my personal life in any way because when its the president its not personal
sydney i hired your reputation
i hired a pit bull not a prom queen
its incredibly unfair
but youve spent a lot of time over the year telling me the trouble with the environmental lobby is that we dont understand the fundamental truth that politics is perception
this is a bad time to develop ignorance
youre making way too much of this
this is your time sydney
youre sitting at the grown ups table
you have a chance to get everything you want run a national campaign be a major player inside the party
but this relationship had better go all the way because with the leader of the free world there is no halfway
politics is perception and if thing dont work out the amount of time itll take you to go from being a hired gun to a cocktail party joke can be
clocked with an egg timer
theres a quick knock at the door leos secretary steps in with a strange looking package
leo there is no relationship
it was one night
solomon this was just delivered by white house messenger
its marked perishable
the white house has sent me something perishable
its for ms
here we go
sydney begins unwrapping the package
im sure its just a formality
exited its from him
of course its from him
so he had some staff flunky send me a fruit basket
he wrote the note himself
im sure he didnt take the time to the messenger said he was waiting in the oval office for ten minutes while the president wrote the card
okay listen so he to leos secretary it took him ten minutes to write a card
apparently he went through several drafts
sydney cant stifle her laugh she sees what the gift is
what is it
what is it
beat a ham
he sent me a virginia ham
dig it ms
youre the presidents girlfriend
sydneys smile fades away
she looks at leo
theres never an egg timer around when you need one
as the white gloved marine snaps the door open for sydney and we shepherd is conferring with lewis and robin
sir theyre gonna be pressing today about whether the white house is prepared to soften the assault weapons section of the crime bill
there is no need to entertain that at this point
how do you want me to handle the sydney issue
the sydney issue
we should have a consensus on how the white house is going to handle it
i sure hope the sydney issue refers in some way to a problem were having with australia because if its anything else
janie pokes her head in
wade is here to see you
tell her she can come right in
im finished here
to lewis and robin there is no sydney issue
sydney enters crossing paths with lewis and robin
they exchange pleasantries
to shepherd thanks for seeing me on such short notice
did you get the ham
i got the ham yes
thank you very much
i wanted to send you flowers but there seem to be some kinks in the system
im really glad you stopped by
i had such a good time last night
so did i
its just that
theyre seconds away sir
during the following janie will go to the desk pick up two briefing books and stick them in a briefcase and gather up his things all without interrupting the conversation
im delivering a luncheon speech at the governors conference this morning
im sorry to no no thats fine
i just stopped by to
are you free for dinner tomorrow night
in the residence
without the united nations
my daughterll be with us so it may seem like the united id love to meet lucy but
an aide has slipped in and hands shepherd a note
reading to himself as he talks sydney shes gonna like you
calling to the aide excuse me jeff
actually i have some concerns that the aide jeff steps back in yes sir
reading the note i cant do this
robbins or stackhouse
i have to be in and out
sir governor stackhouse said he just needed minutes
i think he wants to talk about the assault weapons
stackhouse wants to talk about grazing rights
and hes gone
to sydney sorry
you have concerns
i have one concern
does it having anything to do with one of us being the president
you like to make jokes about this but i am not mocking you honest
im just a guy asking a girl over for a meal
and as if from out of nowhere a loud claaammering like the sound of a jackhammer against cement comes from somewhere outside growing louder and closer whats that
my rides here
and sure enough coming into view outside the windows of the oval office is marine the presidents helicopter
janie comes back in and helps him on with his coat and scarf
leo solomon has serious concerns about my exploring a social you know scenario with the president of the united states
yeah well when you put it that way it doesnt sound that great to me either
its just not have dinner with lucy and me
its meat loaf night how presidential can it be
as shepherd rushes out
continuing seven thirty
sydney now stands alone in the oval office trying to figure out what just happened
marine lifting off the south lawn
tilt down off night sky to reveal a room designed more for comfort than for show with its overstuffed couches
are you ms
standing up smiling sydney
nice to meet you
my dad told me to tell you hes on the phone with his dentist and that i should behave myself and entertain you till he gets here
your fathers on the phone with his dentist
he told me to tell you hes on the phone with his dentist
he wants you to think hes a regular guy
who is he on the phone with
the prime minister of israel
theyre probably not discussing his teeth
theyre talking about that abbreviation i can never remember
capricorn surface to air defense
let meat loaf night begin
everything all right with your teeth
ive got a cavity in my upper bicuspid region
youve got a short range weapons system outside tel aviv
to lucy you turned on me
can we eat
two dozen limos and town cars line this suburban maryland street their drivers waiting patiently
a cocktail party is underway
this is a fat cat fundraiser for the republicans
youre over thinking this
the look and feel of old money
rumson is holding court with a half dozen political insiders
some smoke cigars others sip their drinks
continuing voters arent interested in how to achieve economic growth and they dont want to hear our plans to strengthen foreign policy
so it comes down to character
the press like him senator
the networks the newspapers theyre reporters like him
networks and newspapers like ratings and circulation
for all the bitching we do about liberal bias in the press when it comes down to a character debate
the press is an unwitting accomplice
bob the character debate didnt work out for us
because it couldnt
our polling told us that attacking his character less than a year after hed lost his wife was gonna be a turn off and was gonna make people feel sorry
we couldnt run the campaign we wanted because the opponent was a widower
hes still a widower
times passed but to the rest youll have to forgive my friend
hes been on a hunting trip and cut off from the world
whats going on
and four staffers grab whatever newspaper is closest to their hand and toss them to carl
the presidents got a girlfriend
lucy shepherd and sydney are finishing up a game of scrabble
to lucy your dad says youre studying the constitutional convention
shes not having any fun though
dad youre not having fun
to herself this is a nightmare
this is a social studies nightmare
theyre doing a mock congress
each kid is playing one of the original delegates and they debate the amendments
now whats not fun about that
lucy gets up from the table and kisses her father
it was nice meeting you mrs
it was nice meeting you sydney
it was nice meeting you
sleep well honey
i love you
i love you too
shepherd and sydney are alone now
shes her mother
after a pause
would you like the cent tour
this is the museum area of the white house the part you see when you take the official tour
only a few lights are lit and while the secret service agents give shepherd plenty of breathing room when hes in the residence well still catch a glimpse of one
of them rounding a corner in the distance or checking a doorway ahead
i thought c stad wasnt gonna be operational until january
it was ready ahead of schedule
weve just been waiting for the personnel
no our guys
weve sent a team of army instructors to train the israelis
sydney and shepherd enter the named for its beautiful glass display cases featuring full place settings of the official white house china and silverware from every administration since jackson
remembering i think this is the dish room
its not the dish yeah it is
its the room with all the dishes
its the china room
im more of a west wing president
if youre curious about the mansion theres probably a book you can get therere about seven thousand books
ill get one for you
sydneys been walking slowly around the room looking at the display cases and as she gets near one of the large windows she takes another step which drapes her in
a shaft of incredibly flattering moonlight
the vision isnt lost on shepherd
they stare at each other for a moment
president have you ever noticed how similar the van buren flatware is to the buchanan flatware
do you think there will ever come a time when you can stand in a room with me and not think of me as the president
this isnt a state of mind
you are the president
and when im in a room with you oval or any other shape im always gonna be a lobbyist and youll always be the president
i got news for you sydney
as a lobbyist you would never be alone in a room with the president
this last statement is not lost on sydney
he moves toward her until they are both bathed in the moonlight
he puts his arms around her
you think this is a good idea
they lean in to kiss each other
they barely make contact when
an agent is standing in the doorway shepherd and sydney break apart
we have a secure call from the sit room
shepherd knows what that means
he moves out the door and into the corridor
sydney knowing somethings wrong instinctively moves to follow him and be with him but the agent hasnt moved from the doorway so sorry maam
shepherd comes back in
listen is anything wrong
im sorry were going to have to cut our evening short
the libyans have just bombed c stad
ill try to call you tomorrow
to the agent can you show ms
sydney alone for a second in the dish room is finally approached by a secret service agent who starts to escort her out
the response scenarios in place
the secretary of state the secretary of defense and about a dozen or so pentagon security council and joint chiefs officials are doing exactly what theyre trained for
continuing the f s are fired up on the kimitz and the kitty hawk
theyre just waiting for your attack order mr
and were gonna hit libyan intelligence headquarters
confirmed theyre the ones who planned the bombing
whats the estimate
well level the building
qs in the middle of downtown tripoli are we gonna hit anything else
only if we miss
are we gonna miss
how many people work in that building
weve been all through how many people work in the damn building
ive got those number here
there are three shifts so it the fewest
what shift puts the fewest people in the building
the night shift right
mostly custodial staff and a few what time does the night crew go on
theyre on now sir
its immediate its decisive its low risk and its a proportional response
someday somebodys going to have to explain to me the virtue of a proportional response
theres a silence
shepherd gets up and starts to head out the door
shepherd is with a
lewis robin kodak and a couple of aides all of whom look as though theyve been called out of their homes in the middle of the night
robin as soon as our planes have cleared libyan airspace you can call the press
i dont know when well have the full b
general rork says around o eight hundred
sir what do you think about a national address
the last thing i want to do is put the lybians center stage
i think its a great idea sir
you know rumsons gonna be talking about your lack of military service
this isnt about rumson
what i did tonight was not about political gain
but it can be sir
what you did tonight was very presidential
leon somewhere in libyan right now theres a janitor working the night shift at the libyan intelligence headquarters
hes going about his job cause he has no idea that in about an hour hes gonna die in a massive explosion
hes just going about his job cause he has no idea that an hour ago i gave an order to have him killed
you just saw me do the least presidential thing i do
shepherd is at the podium taking questions
hes flanked by his pentagon staff
and lewis stand to the side
robin stands out of the way
is there anything at all about the c stad weapons system that could have been mistaken by libyan intelligence as offensive rather than defensive
we did everything but show them the blueprints
the hardware was sitting in a airplane hangar for a month
they didnt hit it until the american personnel got there
sir theres an unconfirmed report that you were with sydney wade when you learned of the attack
can you comment
sotto to robin get him off
yes wed just finished dinner
sir would you care to comment on the status of your relationship
we dont have a relationship
we just had dinner
can you tell us if she spent the night at the white house or did folks a lot of people got killed last night
lets try to keep our eyes on the ball okay
shepherd is herded out of the briefing room amidst a chorus of mr
shepherd walks away from the briefing room with robin
janie joins him
that was my fault sir
we should have prepped you for that
theres nothing that needs prepping
lets meet with the leadership after we meet with the security council
newsweek is begging for ten minutes today
any ten minutes you got
nobody gets ten minutes today
shepherd sits at his desk is on the phone
a television newscast is doing a report on congressional reaction to the events of the day
rob rumson is talking
lewis tell the speaker to wait
i want to talk to him
no ill be right down
last night the price of his liberal programs was raised to include the blood of american soldiers
he hangs up
on the tv we see a quick sound bite from rumson
shepherds read a lot of books but you didnt need a harvard degree to see this comin a mile down the road
i went to stanford you blowhole
the fat that our commander in chief has not served one day in uniform shepherd clicks off the tv and then stares at this box just says miscellaneous
is this bedroom miscellaneous or kitchen miscellaneous
sydney and beth have been getting sydney moved in
beth is holding a carton
why did i have to kiss him
you kissed him
you didnt tell me that
i kissed him
on the mouth
exasperated where in the white house
in the dish room
the dish room
the china room
then what happened
he had to go and attack libya
its always something
ive gotta nip this in the bud
this has catastrophe written all over it
in what language
sydney this man is the leader of the free world
hes brilliant hes funny hes handsome and hes an above average dancer
isnt it possible our standards are just a tad high
the phone rings sydney freezes
the phone rings again
continuing answer the phone
answer the phone
hes gonna ask me to come over there
answer the phone
i dont want to go over there
answer the phone
but im gonna end it on the phone
im not gonna go over there
shepherd opens his door revealing sydney
agent cooper is letting her in
i just came over here to tell you why i cant see you anymore
to cooper thanks coop
shepherd closes the door
look i know youve had a tough day
not as tough as some
you want a drink
lemme take your coat
but sydney doesnt take her coat off
president this isnt gonna work
sure it will
you button the top button and it doesnt fall off the hanger
thats not what i
i didnt think so
ive really enjoyed the time weve spent together but this has catastrophe written all over it
president dont pursue me outside the political arena
well i have no intention of pursuing you inside the political arena so that leaves everything out and thats unacceptable to me
if i were on your staff i would tell you that the absolute worst thing you can do coming into an election year is to open yourself up to character
attacks and the fastest way to do that is to prance around like the playboy of the western world
lets clear up a couple of things
number i seldom prance
number i have no intention of engaging in a character debate and number youre not on my staff
yes of course but if youll follow the immutable why is that by the way
why arent you on my staff
you cant afford me
how much do you make
more than you do mr
the names andy
how much money do you make
what the hell does it matter how much money i you would raise your voice to the president
im only thinking about the health of your presidency
you think this mornings press conference was the end of it
bob rumsons gotta be drooling over this
are you attracted to me
i beg your pardon
i asked if of course she is thats not the issue well i tell you what
lets make it the issue
lets try something new cause i know that most couples when theyre first getting together are inclined to slam on the brakes because theyre concerned about bob rumsons drool
youre not most people
you know what your problem is
whats my problem
sex and nervousness
sex and nervousness is my problem
last night when we were looking at the different place settings in the dish room i realized that those place settings were provided by the first ladies
and ill bet none of those first ladies were nervous about having sex with their president husbands
and you know why
no but im sure youll explain it to me
because they werent presidents when they met them
not the case here
you see what im getting at
may i use your bathroom for a moment
its right through there
i want to freshen up
as you pass through youll see a large closet on your left
and if you feel comfortable hang up your coat and when you come back ill have fixed up a drink well sit on the couch and i will explain to
you my plan
you have a plan
dont make me wait
youre on a roll
sydney disappears into the bathroom dressing room area
shepherd keeps talking as he goes to the bar and makes a couple of drinks
speaking up okay
youre attracted to me but the idea of physical intimacy is uncomfortable because you only know me as the president
its not always gonna be that way and the reason i know that is because there was a moment last night when you were with me and not the president
and i know what a big step that was for you
so sydney im in no rush
heres my plan were gonna slow down
when youre comfortable thats when itll happen
sydney comes back into the room
shes wearing one of shepherds dress shirts and nothing else
she walks toward him
continuing perhaps i didnt properly explain the fundamentals of the slow down plan
you explained it great
she moves closer to him
pause are you nervous
my nervousness exists on several levels
number and this is in no particular order i havent done this in a pretty long time
number any expectations you might have due to the fact that im you know
the most powerful man in the world
exactly thank you
just so you remember thats a political distinction that comes with the office
i mean if eisenhower were here instead of me hed be dead by now
and number three
theyre both standing facing each other
they gently kiss
they just stay with it until it becomes easier and better and exactly what they want
does new hampshire want traditional american values back in the white house
a crowd of or so is being whipped into a frenzy
rumsons bringing it home under a campaign banner proclaiming the pride is back bob rumson
does new hampshire want the pride back
the crowd goes nuts upon hearing rumsons signature phrase yeah
my name is bob rumson
and im running for president
and as the crowd loses its mind we it is very early and shepherd is still asleep
as we pull back we reveal that he is alone in his bed
the phone rings
shepherd picks it up into phone yeah
put him through
listens lewis it is a
you gotta get yourself a life man
he hangs up the phone and looks around the room only to notice sydney is tiptoeing around in the dim light trying to quietly dress herself and gather up her
shepherd watches this odd spectacle for a moment before he says continuing sydney
sydney turns around
what are you doing
i wanted to leave the building before the press corps got here
i have those same thoughts every day of my life
say you know lewis rothschild dont you
boy lewisd go nuts if he knew id spent the night
theres a knock on the door
on his way up
come on in lewis
lewis comes in morning mr
president thank you for taking the time to go over those fossil fuel numbers
ill just get my coat and be on my way
shepherd laughs at sydneys purposely lame try to lewis whats the situation
theyre camped out at every exit
whos camped out
the press is camped out
you shoulda taken a cab sydney
they know my car
good morning mr
i came over as soon as lewis called
i think the important thing is not to make it look like were panicking
see and i think the important thing is actually not to be panicking
knocks on the open door and walks in
good morning mr
good morning ms
i see everyones getting an early start today
how do we exit sydney from the building and what do we say to the press at that point
we need a diversion
you understand that by diversion im not saying we set the white house on fire
no please lets do
can i state very clearly that i cant be party to anything illegal
good for you lewis
say what you want but its always the guy in my job that ends up doing eighteen months in danbury minimum security prison
rest easy lewis
were not creating a diversion
to sydney well have somebody take you home
esthers over in my office
shes got the station wagon outside
shepherd regards a
for a moment
clearly the man planned ahead
now the press statement
to sydney sydney when you leave here youre gonna run into reporters and photographers
your pictures gonna be taken every day and youre gonna be asked questions every day
answer them dont answer them its entirely up to you
the white house has no official position except to say no comment
the white house doesnt comment on the presidents personal life
we cant just leave it at that sir
i tell you what lewis we just did
the meetings over thank you mr
lewis robin and a
say their thank you mr
president s on the way out
estherll be in my office

no i mean
i had a good time
ill call you
ill be in panama but ill call you
id like that
sydney gives him a good bye kiss
she exits the bedroom
this is good
as we move through a series of quick dissolves all m
we hear in voice over the sounds of americans electronic media network news news magazines gossip shows talk radio political round tables etc
dissecting the girlfriend factor
sydney and the team are in full gear
lisa rips off another vote on the tote board making it votes in days
sydney ellen wade the political strategist who accompanied president shepherd to last weeks state dinner reportedly spent the night at the white house as a guest of the tote board
reads votes in days

we hear two we dismiss it
but when several several well respected members and former members of the virginia state house on t
can you give us names
each of their own accord comes to me and expresses concern over the woman standing next to i dont even know do we call her the first mistress
when several my god
hes making this up as he goes along
im so sorry about this sydney
my father heard that
shepherd clicks off the t
you gotta tell him to turn a deaf ear
my father doesnt have a deaf ear
he hears fine out of both
so do i
so does my sister so do my friends
youre the only one who seems to sydney i cant challenge the school bully to a fight just because he picked on my girlfriend
im not asking you to

this isnt about me
how can you keep quiet
how do you have patience for people who claim they love america but clearly cant stand americans
i have one more election left sydney
i dont have the luxury of losing my patience
i want to say something but im gonna fumble it a little bit so id just like you to wait till im done before you respond
im in love with you
im certain of it
and i want to be with you more than anything

well congratulations fellas youre outta the cellar
mcsorley told me the only thing on the presidents domestic agenda they were more committed to defeating than the crime bill was the fossil fuel package
this catches shepherd and a
by surprise like accidentally drawing to an inside straight
youre kidding right
sydney isnt aware shes said anything of particular consequence
no im not kidding
its funny that he used the same words

stickin the fossil fuel package in a drawer
no the gdcs political director didnt tell us anything
sydney wade told her boyfriend and her boyfriends best friend that she had a lousy day

if sydney gets her votes and were three short theres some maneuvering to be done
i made a promise a
you made a deal mr
i made it with sydney
you made it with the gdc
yeah well this is all academic anyway
were not going to need those votes
if your approval rating drops any more things are gonna get tight
lewis sits with a congressmans aide
im hearing rumors that your boss is wavering on the crime bill
you cant believe rumors lewis you know this town
thats what i wanted to hear

my boss is starting to waver on the crime bill
a lunchtime crowd is doing business over white wine oysters and cobb salads

david is on the phone to the interns she got pennybaker
david rips off the top sheet of the tote board which now reads votes in days

what if i do a new poll
we give him detailed public opinion
and we put sydney in the new model
its meaningless unless we ask him about sydney
the streets been temporarily closed to traffic and secret service agents man the sidewalk
the press and onlookers form a small crowd kept well at bay by police barricades
shepherd and sydney are finishing up dinner
this was delicious
is there any left
taking his bowl tons
i didnt think you liked it
are you kidding me of course i did
but actually its not for me
the agent who checked the food thought it was delicious and i sort of told him id bring him some if there was any left
so you didnt like it
no i loved it
no im not
i can tell when youre holding something back
you do a thing with your face
sydney pops a bottle of port and pours two glasses
when have you seen me do a thing with my face
two days before i met you
you gave a speech for the daughters of the american revolution
i was there
you remember the speech
american can no longer afford to pretend that they live in a great society
there was supposed to be something else after that wasnt there
how did you know
i told you
sydney hands him a glass
they clink glasses and sip
whats the occasion
youre looking at a lady whos two votes shy of the promised land
i got pennybaker

kodak sits at his desk staring at a computer printout
lewis is nearing the end of a phone conversation that isnt going well
hes pacing around with the phone
desperate and intense
the tote board reads vote in days
to kodak howre the numbers
character across the board
who is lewis on with
hes trying to keep his finger in the dam
into phone youre supposed to be a united states congressman for the love of christ
robin and kodak appear in the doorway sensing a surprise development
lewis is losing it on the phone
continuing listens but youre not gonna stay at
the numbers are gonna be go back up
listens but theyre gonna go back up
listens congressman jarrett
listens george its crunch time
this is one of those moments
its just you and the president
now thats it gonna be
lewis looks over at robin and kodak
his face telling the story
listens hey george
can i tell you something
were gonna win this thing
were gonna get the votes and were gonna win
and after we do i mean that very night im gonna go to sam harrys im gonna order a big steak and im gonna make a list of everybody who
tried to fuck us this week
robin and kodak are trying to get their friend from setting fire to a bridge out of pure frustration
a whispered shout lewis
into phone vote your conscience you chicken shit lame ass lewis hangs up the phone
he takes a deep breath slumps down in the nearest chair and looks up at robin and kodak
theres a long silence before lewis says continuing we lost jarrett
beat i hope so
cause you know if that was an undecided then we need to work on our people skills
lewis picks up the phone and punches in a few numbers
even before that line starts ringing he picks up another phone and punches in a different set of numbers
into the first phone karen its lewis
could you hunt down congressman quincy for me
i need to talk to him right way
shepherd stands in front a
lewis robin and kodak
janie is somewhere in the background
we lost quincy too
did he give a reason
he thinks your numbers arent likely to rebound
were three votes down again sir
theres a pause before
president as of this morning sydney only needed one more vote
the motown three have gotta be scared blind
i dont think therell be a better opportunity
the press is expecting an announcement on the crime bill by the sate of the union
if you agree to stick in a drawer until after the elections theyll give you the three votes
beat and we declare victory sir
we said as a last resort
were there sir
the state of the union is hours away
theres gotta be three votes someplace else
theres gotta be somebody we havent there isnt sir
i beg your pardon
what about storch
president storch is a no
not that clark the one from indiana
pause that one too sir
shepherd is stopped
president i think we have to do it
she is one vote away a
its important legislation that for the first time has a legitimate chance
i think she deserves every possible opportunity to she
you meant it didnt you sir
you meant the important legislation deserves every opportunity
lewis shut up
theres a horrible silence in the room
shepherd has locked eyes with lewis
you got something to say to me
i think we should examine the new poll for more than its value as a box score
they dont like that im going out with sydney
its not that simple sir
i think this poll helps bribg a murky problem into specific relief
whose problem we talking about lewis
you worried about your job
this poll isnt talking about my presidency
this poll is talking about my life
two hundred and sixty four million people have decided mr
president two hundred and sixty four million people dont give a damn about your life
they give a damn about their own
all right thats enough
president youve raised a daughter almost entirely on your own and shes terrific
what does it say to you that in the last seven weeks percent of this country has begun to question your family values
the president doesnt answer to you lewis
oh yes he does a
im a citizen this is my president and in this country it is not only permissible to question our leaders it is our responsibility
but you already know that mr
president because you have a deeper love of this country than any man ive ever known and i want to know what it says to you that in the past
seven weeks percent of americans have begun to question your patriotism
look if people want to listen to bob rumson they dont have a choice
rob rumsons the only one doing the talking
people want leadership
and in the absence of genuine leadership they will listen to anyone who steps up to the microphone
they want leadership mr
theyre so thirsty for it theyll crawl through the desert toward a mirage and when they discover theres no water theyll drink the sand
evenly lewis weve had presidents who were beloved who couldnt find a coherent sentence with two hands and a flashlight
people dont drink the sand cause theyre thirsty lewis
they drink it cause they dont know the difference
the room is slightly stunned by what their president has just said
shepherd picks up the polling data and heads to the door
continuing on his way out make the deal
sydney susan david interns and staffers are having a little office celebration
champagne flows from paper cups
streamers and balloons adorn the tote board which reads votes in day
susan maybe a little drunk has concerned sydney
i want to go on the record and apologize for my attitude toward you since your arrival
i didnt notice
was there an attitude
a phone rings and one of the staffers takes it
sydney tries to rejoin the party but i think i have a lot of pent up hostility
well i wonder who i can blame it on
im not really qualified to cause ive been blaming it on my mother and my ex husband and that hasnt been working
approaching sydney leo needs to see you
tell him to get over here
its a party
he needs to see you in his office
it cant wait
he just got off the phone with macinerney
theres been a development
sydney holds for a moment
then heads out the door and we trombone music comes from lucys bedroom as shepherd rounds the corner
shepherd pops his head in
hey dad whats wrong with sydney
you guys have a fight
beat what do you mean
she seemed pretty you saw her
in your room
why is she mad
dont worry about it
were you a dork
practice your music
if you were a dork you should say youre sorry
girls like that
sydney is going through the closet in search of something
the door opens and shepherd steps in perhaps a little tentatively
he doesnt see sydney at first
calling out syd
sydney comes out
have you seen a gray cableknit sweater
i called you at the office but
i wore it here one time and i didnt want to leave it
where were you going
sydney continues her search
im going home and then im going to hartford
do you know if it was sent with your dry cleaning by any whats in connecticut
richard reynolds campaign
he may be able to get me a job
when did you decide to get a new job
not long after leo solomon fired me from my old one
beths gonna kill me
she loves that why did he fire you
total failure to achieve any of the objectives for which i was hired
i told him he was being unreasonable
after all i did get to dance with the president and ride in air force one a couple of times
but you know those prickly environmentalists
its always gonna be something with them
if its not clean air then its clean water
like it isnt good enough that im on the cover of people magazine
ill call him
youll call him
you mean youll call him yourself
itll come from the president
thats a great idea
i think you should call leo and make a deal
he hires me back for say days
i go around scaring the hell out of congress making them think that the presidents about to drive through a very damaging and costly bill
theyll believe me right cause im the presidents friday night girl
now i dont know if you can dip into this well twice especially since ive lost all credibility in politics but you never know i might just be able to
pull it off again
i might be able to give you just the leverage you need to pass some ground breaking piece of crime legislation like a mandatory three day waiting period before a
five year old can buy an uzi
fuck the sweater shell have to learn to live with disappointment
she starts to exit what do you think went on here today
i know exactly what went on here today
i got screwed
you saw the poll you needed the crime bill you couldnt get it on your own so i got screwed
the environment got screwed
nothing happened to you today sydney
governing is choosing
governing is prioritizing
ive made no secret of the fact that the crime bill was my top priority
well then congratulations
its only taken you three years to put together crime prevention legislation that has no hope of preventing crime
sydney heads out the door stopping sydney
i dont want to lose you over this
president you got bigger problems than losing me
you just lost my vote
and sydney is out the door
we hold on shepherd looking like a man whos taken a lot of punches to the heads
a rack of billiard balls explodes from the break
whats in hartford
richard reynolds district office
shes thinking of running his campaign
four in the corner
shepherd gets down over the ball continuing hartford
the insurance capital of the world
have a good time syd
shepherd smacks the ball bulls eye
im gonna have janie clear your schedule for the weekend
you need to get some rest
you handling me a
in the side
shepherd gets down over the ball
but instead of the cue hitting the ball its a
s palms slamming the cue against the table
but i sure as hell will if you dont start gettin your head outta your ass
lewis is right
go after this guy
has he lied
has rumson lied in the last seven weeks
has he lied
other than not knowing the difference between harvard and stanford has he said something that isnt true
am i not a commander in chief whos never served in the military
am i not opposed to a constitutional amendment banning flag burning
am i not an unmarried father who was sharing a bed with a liberal lobbyist down the hall from my twelve year old daughter
and you think youre wrong
i dont think you win elections by telling percent of the people that they are
we fight the fights we can win
dont you fight the fights that need fighting
is the view pretty good from the cheap seats a
i beg your pardon
it occurs to me that in years ive never seen your name on a ballot
why have you always been standing a pace behind me
because if i hadnt been youd be the most popular history professor at the university of wisconsin
shepherds tossed his cue stick and is heading out
continuing have lewis put the final drafts of the state of the union and the crime bill announcement on my desk in the morning
shepherd gets to the doorway
if mary hadnt died
would we have won three years ago
would we have won
if wed had to go through a character debate three years ago would we have won
i dont know
but i wouldve liked that campaign
if my friend andy shepherd had shown up i would have liked that campaign
shepherd looks away
shepherd exits leaving a
alone as we a series of shots showing shepherd walking down the corridor to the dish room then walking down a long corridor which contains a series of paintings of
then sitting alone in the oval office lost in thought
shepherd and lucy are eating breakfast in silence neither of them very happy each with their own problems
a nearby t
monitor glows with the live coverage of robins morning press briefing
youre not hungry
this is oatmeal
we never have oatmeal
its good for you
im from wisconsin
i need food
youre not from wisconsin
im from wisconsin
youve lived in washington your whole life
he glances toward the t
robins standing up there doing what shes been told no comment
no this president is not participating in character debates
he mutes the volume
continuing how are you doing in your constitutional debates
we ratified it last week
why didnt you tell me
its not a big deal dad
okay i give up
i dont care why youre not happy in social studies
i care about why youre not talking to me about why youre not happy in social studies
dad im perfectly youre not perfectly happy
you dont think i know when somethings bothering you
you know talk to me
look lucy winds herself up
it would appear shes about to burst
shes about to say the hardest thing shes ever had to say in her life continuing sometimes when you talk you say things i disagree with
shepherd is stunned and totally confused
almost every time i talk i say things you disagree with
i mean politically
pause what do you mean
it just starts spilling out in a stream yes
sometimes i mean im not sure
you know a lot more than i do but still i have these feelings and i dont think theyre wrong
like okay for instance im not so sure its all right to burn a flag
i mean it really bothers a lot of people and i dont know why you think its okay
i hear senator rumson talk and some of the things he says sounds right to me and i think god am i like bob rumson
i mean dad thinks hes a jerk
dad hates this guy
why am i agreeing with him and then i think well maybe im not really like bob rumson but maybe im not like dad either
but the point is im the presidents kid and people pay attention to what i say and if i say something different from what you say itll be embarrassing for
so i cant just get up in social studies class and say whatever i want
shepherd is silent
totally blown away
he had absolutely no idea
he stands up slowly and moves toward her
lucy doesnt know whats coming
quietly stand up please
lucy gets up slowly
shes never seen her father like this
continuing i want you to pay very close attention to what happens now
shepherd knees down cups her daughters face in his hands and gently kisses her forehead
he pulls her to him and holds her in a tight embrace
continuing in your lifetime you will never embarrass me
it could never happen
youre not the presidents daughter lucy youre mine
and no ones gonna vote me out of that job
youre my daughter and everything else is a distant second
more school is for you lucy
you say what you want
the only thing you have to do to make me happy is come home at the end of the day
lucy squeezes her dad tight
they hold the embrace for a long moment
continuing one more thing
i dont dislike senator rumson because of his political views
and even if you voted for everything he would vote for that wouldnt make you like him
theres a fundamental difference between you and the bob rumsons of the world
the difference is that he says he loves america
saying you love america is easy
what takes character and this is what you have shepherd trails off realizing hes about to quote sydney
continuing what takes character is loving americans
beat and now its as if shepherd is waking himself up from the longest trip of his life
he looks over at the t
no i dont know how many other ways i can say it
the white house isnt getting involved in
continuing luce i gotta go
dad is everything all right
im just a little late for work
he heads for the door shouting out as he goes somebody get my daughter some food
the girls from wisconsin for cryin out loud
and hes gone as we
robin is on her last drops of energy and patience
robin will the president ever respond to senator rumsons question about being a member of the american civil liberties union
but instead of hands going up the press corps suddenly stands
robin turns to see shepherd stride in and step up to the podium
yes he will
good morning mr
shepherd takes the podium
theres a palpable buzz in the room as video operators adjust their equipment etc
people starts to stand
thats all right you can keep your seats
for the last couple of months senator rumson has suggested that being president of this country was to a certain extent about character
whos picked up the receiver from a wall phone and punches in four numbers
she turns in to the wall to shield her conversation from the rest of the room
into phone lewis
and come on down here
i dont know but somethings happening
and although i have not been willing to engage in his attacks on me ive been here three years and three days and i can tell you without hesitation being
president of this country is entirely about character
lewis enters with a
continuing for the record yes i am a card carrying member of the a
but the more important question is why arent you bob
this is an organization whose sole purpose is to defend the bill of rights so it naturally begs the questions
continuing why would a senator his partys most powerful spokesman and a candidate for president choose to reject upholding the constitution
if you can answer that question then folks youre smarter than i am because i didnt understand it until a couple of minutes ago
everybody knows american isnt easy
america is advanced citizenship
continuing you gotta want it bad cause its gonna put up a fight
its gonna say you want free speech
lets see you acknowledge a man whose words make your blood boil whos standing center stage and advocating at the top of his lungs that which you would spend a
lifetime opposing at the top of yours
you want to claim this land as the land of the free then the symbol of your country cant just be a flag the symbol also has to be one
of its citizens exercising his right to burn that flag in protest
show me that defend that celebrate that in your classrooms
then you can stand up and sing about the land of the free
ive known bob rumson for years
ive been operating under the assumption that the reason bob devotes so much time and energy to shouting at the rain was that he simply didnt get it
well i was wrong
continuing bobs problem isnt that he doesnt get it
bobs problem is that he cant sell it
nobody has ever won an election by talking about what i was just talking about
continuing this is a country made up of people with hard jobs that theyre terrified of losing
the roots of freedom are of little or no interest to them at the moment
we are a nation afraid to go out at night
were a society that has assigned low priority to education and has looked the other way while our public schools have been decimated
we have serious problems to solve and we need serious men to solve them
and whatever your particular problem is friend i promise you bob rumson is not the least bit interested in solving it
he is interested in two things and two things only making you afraid of it and telling you whos to blame for it
that ladies and gentlemen is how you win elections
you gather a group of middle aged middle class middle income voters who remember with longing an easier time and you talk to them about family and american values and
then you have an old photo of the presidents girlfriend
you scream about patriotism and you tell them shes to blame for their lot in life you go on television and you call her a whore
sydney ellen wade has done nothing to you bob
she has done nothing but put herself through law school prosecute criminals for five years represent the interests of public school teachers for two years and lobby for the safety
of our natural resources
continuing you want a character debate
fine but you better stick with me cause sydney ellen wade is way out of your league
ive loved two women in my life
i lost one to cancer and i lost the other cause i was so busy keeping my job i forgot to do my job
well that ends right now
continuing tomorrow morning the white house is sending a bill to congress for its consideration
its white house resolution an energy bill requiring a percent reduction of the emission of fossil fuels over the next ten years
it is by far the most aggressive stride ever taken in the fight to reverse the effects of global warming
the other piece of legislation is the crime bill
as of today it no longer exists
im throwing it out
im throwing it out and writing a law that makes sense
you cannot address crime prevention without getting rid of assault weapons and handguns
i consider them a threat to national security and i will go door to door if i have to but im gonna convince americans that im right and im gonna
get the guns
weve got serous problems and we need serious men and if you want to talk about character bob youd better come at me with more than a burning flag and
a membership card
if you want to talk about character and american values fine
just tell me where and when and ill show up
this is a time for serious men bob and your fifteen minutes are up
my names andrew shepherd and i am the president
shepherd exits the press room leaving a stunned room in his wake
the murmurs begin from the press corps
theyre talking among themselves confirming that they just saw what they just saw
robin steps to the podium
and lewis are following after the president
well you dont see that every day of the week
hes got the whole white house press corps asking each other how to spell erudite
lewis call the printer
gotta rewrite the state of the union
every word lewis
its a whole new ball game
youve got minutes
i thought i was gonna be rushed
lewis goes off in one direction
heads towards the oval office
shepherd is on the phone
i dont want the limo
i dont want an escort
continuing i want a plain ordinary non bullet proof automobile
someone around here must have a chevy i can borrow
well find one and meet me outside the west wing entrance in five minutes
where are you going
im going to her house
im gonna stand at her front door till she lets me in
and im not leaving till i get her back
howre you gonna do that
i havent worked that out yet
but im sure groveling will be involved
youre just gonna drive over
im the commander in chief of the most powerful army in the world
you dont think i can drive ten blocks
just stay away from dupont circle
i hear its murder this time of day
shepherd doesnt need to turn around to know whos standing in the doorway but of course he does anyway
its nice to see you ms
if anybody needs me ill be in the roosevelt room giving lewis oxygen
i heard your speech
i was in my car and it just kind of steered its way over here
sydney and shepherd just gaze at each other for a moment and smile
sydney starts toward him
continuing sydney i didnt decide to send to the floor to get you back
i didnt come back cause you decided to send to the floor
they move to kiss
it doesnt last very long because
president i thought you might want to look at this
i moved social security up front
janie enters mr
president leventhal at treasury wants two minutes
chapil enters mr
president excuse me miss wade miss mccall is on her way over
to sydney ive got some things to do
yes you do
its lit up and glowing on this cold clear night
were only a moment or two away from the arrival of president shepherd and his state of the union address
lloyd youve served on the staffs of several past administrations what kind of last minute activity is the president engaged in right now
its off the main corridor and its being used as a green room for shepherd and his group lewis kodak a
janie and various aides and staffers
people are buzzing around in a last minute flurry
shepherd is fumbling with his cuff links
im having a cuff links crisis
lucy takes his sleeves
continuing to lucy i think theyve locked
robin steps in
president theyre waiting for you
things have been a little rough between us lately
i know sir im sorry
dont stop what youre doing
thats kind of you sir but i realize ive been a little insensitive about some personal
no you were right
two hundred and sixty four million people dont give a damn about my life
just so you know ive never been one of them mr
this way people
to lewis see you after
the people in the room start to gather their things and exit robin handling any and all last minute mr
president s as she herds people out the door
lucy walks past shepherd
she holds shepherds old tattered textbook and has it opened to a specific page
continuing whatcha got there luce
article section of the u
reading he shall from time to time give to the congress information of the state of the union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary
sounds right up your alley
shepherd looks at his old friend and extends his hand for a deeply felt handshake
grasps shepherds hand and then pulls him into a strong embrace
whispers a shout into shepherds ear continuing give em hell andy
pulls away leaving shepherd to enjoy the moment without having to speak continuing youve got seconds mr
to lucy ill see you afterward
i want a critique
the room clears out
revealing sydney dressed like the first lady shes soon to be sitting against the window sill
continuing theres been something ive been trying to give you since our first date
i tried a bunch of times but somehow ive always managed to trip over my job
shepherd has picked his black canvas gym bag with the gold presidential seal
he reaches in the bag and pulls out a bouquet of flowers
continuing these are for you
janie pokes her head in
should i stay here
no walk with me
they exit into a hallway lined with congressional staffers secret service capitol security white house staff and most prominently a
lewis robin janie and kodak
sydney is still clutching her flowers as they near the double doors to the house chamber howd you finally do it
raising his voice above the cheering do what
manage to give a woman flowers and be president at the same time
it turns out ive got a rose garden
sydney is stopped in her tracks as the doors to the chamber fly open mr
the president of the the chamber leaps to its feet in a thunderous ovation shouts of bravo
from the gallery
at the back lewis and robin and kodak are trying to maintain their professional cool but its a moment impossible not to get caught up in
sydney is clutching her flowers with both hands
