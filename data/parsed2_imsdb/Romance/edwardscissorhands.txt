why is it snowing grandma
where does it come from
oh thats a long story sweetheart
i want to hear
oh not tonight
go to sleep
im not sleepy
tell me please
well all right
i guess it would have to start with scissors
well there are all kinds of scissors
and once there was even a man who had scissors for hands
you know the mansion on top of the mountain
well a long time ago an inventor lived in that mansion
he made many things i suppose
he also created a man
he gave him inside a heart a brain everything
well almost everything
you see the inventor was very old
he died before he got to finish the man he invented
so the man was left by himself incomplete and all alone
he didnt have a name
of course he had a name
his name was edward
werent you just here
no not since last season
today ive come to show you our exquisite new line of soft colors in shadows blushes and lipstick

and out she pops
you know on tv they say you repairmen are lonely bunch of people
housewives get lonely too
although you may not realize it since they havent made a commercial on the subject

and then you just screw this back on
the bell rings

youve got rollers in your damn hair
now what did i do with my sci
edward um would you
i have a doctor friend who i think could help you
yes i can help with the scars
i just want to consult the avon handbook before doing anything
kevin its not polite to stare
think how it would make you feel if somebody were staring at you
i wouldnt care
well i would so dont do it
this must be quite a change for you ed
i think he prefers edward
so what have you been doing up there in that big old place
i bet the view must be spectacular ed
i was just
see all the way to the ocean
bill could i have the salt and pepper
man those things are cool
you know i bet theyre razor sharp
one karate chop to a guys neck
would you like some butter for your bread
can i bring him to show and tell on monday
ive had enough
to edward you think you can sleep
things feel strange now but soon youll feel right at home
peg tries to cover edwards scars
the light concealing cream goes on first then you blend and blend and blend
blending is the secret
more concealing for you
but you complexion is so fair
now this has a touch of lavender in it
give it a try here
this should do the trick here
i have another idea
well cover up the scars and start with a completely smooth surface
dont eat this stuff
sports announcements on hartely into the windup and the strike one pitch
swung on and missed strike two
if its a hit the club has hits
but they still have on the scoreboard and its
and the count to warren
now they change it to hits
turn it up kevin
i cant hear it
no make it louder
sports announcements on hartelys strike two pitch is hammered
you hear that mr
no make it louder
sports announcements on its going way back
its out of here
it is history
sports announcements on a grand slam for martinez to make it a five run inning and blow this game to pieces
ill be darned
they filled the whole tape
peg listens to the recorded phones
whats going on over there peg
hi its margie
who is he
oh by the way here its pouring rain in the mountains
you think the kids are okay
hi there darling
the gals are all in a tizzy about your secret visitor
you cant keep him a secret forever
boy its just wonderful ed
my god you you have the whole family in there dont you
edward come here
kevin cleans edwards scissorhands with water
no no no
thats a terrible idea son
go to the garage and get the oil can
we dont want him rusting up on this now do we
edward you did us
yes it is
esmeralda comes near
its not heaven hes from
its straight from the stinking flames of hell
the power of satan is in him
i can feel it
god you have the poor sheep strayed so far from the path
we are not sheep
dont come near me
get out of here
edward dont you listen to her
dont worry about her edward
shes just an old lonely loony
women knock on the door
you are all hiding in there like a bunch of old hermit crabs
shame on you keeping your unusual guest all to yourself
we think thats mighty selfish of you
no it its
things have just been a little hectic around here
oh that was so sweet of you to want to correct the situation
what time does the barbecue begin
well you intend to show your guest hospitality by introducing him to your friends dont you
ill bring coleslaw
and i will bring the ambrosia salad
what time was it that you said
he has been sent first to tempt you
but its not too late
you must push him from you
trample down the perversion of nature
did you hear that
hes the perversion of nature
wow isnt that exciting
see you later
ive always said that you really cant have a picnic or a barbecue without deviled eggs
theyre just the best
they make the thing
i didnt know you chopped all those things
what a really big
peg notices a cut on his face
oh all right now
its just a nick
theres no need to be nervous dear
you know esmeralda wont be here and the rest of neighbors there are really very nice
theres no need to be nervous
they are so eager to meet you
you just have to be yourself
just your own sweet self
hey play scissors paper stone with us
play scissors what
i got a doctor friend might be able to help you
arent they most incredible
he did them just like that
how are you doing
thats a heck of handshake
i saw you on the golf course
you got a dozen of the melons
to edward are you ok
do you want something to eat
are you hungry
do you want a cracker
different completely different no kidding mysterious
do you imagine those hands are hot or cold
just think what a single snip could do
to edward eddie
the guys and i were talking wed like want to invite you to our card game on friday night
would you like that
only thing is you cant cut
i have my own infirmity
never did me a bit of harm
took some shrapnel during the war and ever since then i cant feel a thing
not a damn thing
listen dont you ever let anybody tell you you have a handicap
dont be ridiculous
youre not handicapped
what do they call that
my names joyce
and i noticed that you have not tasted any of the ambrosia salad that i made especially for you
joyce helps edward to eat
you must try this
many women flock to him to edward you must try this
its my mothers recipe
let him chew for heaven sakes with your green thumb
i could use your help
there you go
i want a row of angels
but hes promised to come to my house first
havent you eddie
grab your plates
i thought it was shish kebab
i thought it was shish kebab
yeah it it is shish kebab
it was a figure of speech ed
you got to learn not to take things so literally
on hearing that edward looks back the time the inventor taught him the etiquette
let us pretend were in the drawing room and the hostess is serving tea now many numerous little questions confront us should the man rise when he accepts his cup
may lump sugar be taken with the things
is it good form to accept a second cup
now should the napkin be entirely unfolded
oh should the center crease
be allowed to remain
it is so easy to commit embarrassing blunders
but etiquette humiliation and discomfort
mmm yes boring
let us switch to um
to some poetry hmm
there was an old man from the cape
who made himself there but they keep such a beautiful shape
go ahead smile
okay guys were home
i cant believe
everythings still sopping
i cant wait to take a shower
and wash off the mildew
if my parents set the alarm im screwed ill sleep in the yard
i told you to call to say were coming back early
hed rather complain
how else can i be the center of the attention
you didnt call your parents
they dont run their house like a police station
thanks for driving denny
see you later
see you later
dont forget your arm
come on jim lets go
theres somebody in my room
a murderer with an axe
he did try to even kill me
its all right
its all right
to kevin go back to bed
its only edward
to edward this way
honey that was edward
who is he
what are you talking about
edwards come to live with us
theres nothing to be upset about
well have you a setup here in a minute
up with your feet
a queen size bed here
how do you like that
its all made up and everything
there you go
whats the matter
she gets you nervous
youve been closed up in a way in that castle too long
you dont know anything about the wonderful world of teen age girls
theyre all crazy
straighten that out
what is it
i dont know what it is
they reach a certain age
they develop these gland things
their bodies swell up
they go crazy
i try not to think about it edward drinks lemonade
peg calms down kim
now you stay in kevins room tonight
tomorrow well fix your room right
mom why did you have to bring him in here
oh honey i couldnt have left him there all alone
you would have done the same thing
why does he have to stay here
oh my goodness kim
im surprised at you
he cant help the way he is
have a little sympathy
i do have a little sympathy
then lets just say hello and later you can come downstairs and shake his hand
shake his hand
well not literally
goodness you scared him half to death
i scared him to death
i just wanted you two to have a proper introduction
edward this is our daughter kim
kim this is edward whos going to live with us
edward falls on the floor
to edward eddie
to kisses kisses hush up
i can hardly hear myself think
mommas precious little baby girl
to edward wouldnt you like a nice cool glass of lemonade
vomits bell rings one chop to guys neck
and its all over
theyre the sharpest things in the world
they can hack through anything
i think they look weird
they give me the creeps
you should see the clown in front of ms
hes calling you kim
edward you forgot your cookies
dont worry eddie
shes waiting for you
bill you know what edward told me
he had lunch at jackies today
shes just had her kitchen completely redone
ill be darned
new paint new cabinets new floors new microwave new sonnet dishwasher
yeah isnt that wonderful

jim didnt you tell me your mom had her kitchen done too
yeah my dad bought himself a bunch of new toys
big screen tv cd players vcr with four heads
my goodness sake
i wonder what its like to be that rich
no they keep things pretty much locked up
my father has his own room for his stuff to make sure i cant get and use it
hes so cheap he wont help me buy my own car
well he probably wants you to pay for it yourself
i agree with him
it builds character
youll appreciate it more
speaking of money i understand you are not charging for gardening edward
margie made him cookies today
sweetheart you cant buy the necessities of life with cookies
you cant buy car with cookies
am i right jim
ah thats true sir
edward gives a piece of meat to kims friend
i cant eat that
he used his hands
i dont think its sanitary
edward passes the piece to kim but drops it in her lap by mistake
honey you want me to help you clean that up
no thats okay
ill be right back
edward begins styling womens hair and becomes famous
this cant possibly be my alexis
to edward she looks so beautiful
look at you
it wont be long
she has just to decide on the style and then it will be fine
she just has to decide what style she wants
i was hoping for something big and bouffant
kind of like mine
dont you worry kisses
youll be so pretty
eddie is there anything you cant do
you take my breath away
look at this
have you ever cut a womans hair
would you cut mine
that was the single most thrilling experience of my whole life
were getting the head of the company
were in here
what did you do to your hair
edward cut it
isnt it wild
on telephone hello
oh i cant believe im talking to you in person
this is such an honor
hes right here
so then you know all about it
thats exactly what ive been using
well ive had a little trouble getting it to the right consistency
just a little
ill try that
well what imaginative suggestions
i sure will
thank you so much
to edward no wonder shes the head of the company
you know she started out as a sales representative just like me
ive always wanted to talk to her but until now i never had a reason
she had some ideas
you bet she did
at the airport ill get that
lets get you sharpened up
you got it
no i cant believe this
kim sees edward coming
do you have a key
i could have sworn i put it in here somewhere
well were stranded
edward opens the locked door with his scissorhands
ed what a guy
hey you didnt break it or scratch it or anything
hey be a pal and yell when peg pulls in huh
quite a story yes
any questions for edward
yeah get way over
stand right up
whats been the best part of your new life here in town
the friends ive made
any other questions
have you ever thought of having corrective surgery or prosthetics
i know a doctor that might be able to help you
id like to meet him
well give that name after the show
thank you very much
thats very nice
yes stand right up
but if you had regular hands youd be like everyone else
yes i know
i think hed like that
then no one would think youre special
you wouldnt be on tv or anything
no matter what edward will always special
stand right up
your work is so interesting distinctive and unique
do you have plans to open your own beauty salon
theres an idea
do you have a girl friend
living room in pegs sure he does
now you got him started
knock it off bubble butt
you did it
on the tv show how about it
is there some special lady in your life
uh everythings all right
hell take a break and well be right back after these messages
why are you laughing
he got hurt
it was a little shock
a little shock
i wish wed been taping that
id give my left nut to see that again
edward in beauty salon arent you excited
oh this is just so thrilling
wait till i show it to you
its just perfect
its just what weve been looking for
i want to call it shear heaven
here we are
no all along here im going to put a row of new mirrors
back up here a whole row of new cosmetics
all along this row here
peg could sell cosmetics
this is where i stand when i greet the customers
back in here is what i really want to show you
this is the storeroom for supplies
what i need from you today is to help me make a decision
dont thats dangerous
you just sit down right there
i have some smocks
would you like me to model them
this is my favorite because its yellow
and what its for is to catch itchy little trimming that fall down your neck
then theres this old purple one you know you kind of drape around you like this
i like that one
so am i
ive been waiting for this moment for so long
edward you come back here
you cant do that
in the restaurant veloro
that hangs on the dash board
ive never seen that
sorry im late
we had to go ahead without you
here you go
so edward did you have a productive day
monroe showed me where the salon is going to be
you could have a cosmetic counter
wouldnt that be great
and then she showed me the back room where she took all of her clothes off
i cant tell you how thrilled i am
im just as pleased as punch
this whole beauty parlor thats whats going to teach you volumes
theres nothing like running your own business
ive never done it myself but from what i gather its the greatest satisfaction a working man can have
so i guess the bank is going to be your next step huh
yeah take out a loan
get yourself started
nothing to worry about
with your talent and reputation its going to be a snap
no credit no record of jobs youve held no savings no personal investment no social security number
you may as well not even exist
there is no collateral
we already have a second on the house but dont the testimonials make a difference
did you see here the mayors wife cant wait to become a client
we simply cant do it
now get yourself a social security card
establish credit and buy yourself a car
you have the side to advantage
you can get one of those handicapped placards
park anywhere you like
i cant believe it
really its just an outrage
dont you worry
this isnt the end of it
well get your money somewhere
but thats breaking and entering
my parents have insurance up the rear
and all it will cost them is a little hassle
thats about it
in a week my dad will have new and better everything
theres a guy who will give us cash for the stuff
jim i dont want to
well do you want to ride around in a van like dennys and we could be by ourselves whenever we like
with a mattress in the back
why cant you just do it
because my father keeps the damn room locked and we need edward to get us in
why cant you take the key like when hes sleeping or something
look you dont understand everything he handcuffs or ties will do anything for you
what do you mean
thats not true
why dont you ask him
thats not fair
whats fair got to do with it
there isnt any other way
there got to be
ive racked my brain
dont you want us to have our own van
jim the lights are on
those go on automatically
theyve gone for the weekend
i told you
this burglar scared
you turned off the alarm
am i right
yes everything come on
i cant believe this is happening
are you sure he doesnt know this is jims house
hes never been here
this person stole from you
keep your voice down
i told you he stole it
his parents will make him give it back
listen ive already tried that
the guys parents are like he is
now you told kim youd do this
well come on
edward picks the lock and the door opens but when he steps into the room the alarm works and the door shuts
the bastard had it wired separately
we cant just leave him here
we know youre in there
were in the process of deactivating the system so that you can come out
denny turn around
jim its your house
they cant arrest you for setting off your own alarm
well just tell them we were breaking in
im not going back there
we have to go back
no because my father will prosecute
his own son
especially his own son
if edward tells ill kill him
denny turn around
we have to
put your hands high in the air so we can see them
put your hands up
to allen hes got something in his hands
looks like knives
drop your weapon i repeat
drop your weapon
ill ask you one more time and this is your last warning
drop your weapon
if you fail to do so well have to open fire
dont make us do that please
drop your weapons
looks like we got a psycho
prepare to fire
neighbors gather and ask not to fire
we know him
alright cuff him
at police station but can we see him now
well have to hold him overnight for observation
he has to stay in prison all night
pick him up in the morning
criminal investigation section in police station oh edward
hello edward dear
i blame myself
to edward what in gods name was going through your mind son
why dont i set a better example
you saw how i envied jims parents their money
what were you going to do with that stuff
oh i blithely say well get money for the salon somehow
but i never meant stealing
stealings not the way to get it
stealings not the way to get anything
and youre in a heap of that
why ever did you do this
will he be okay doc
the years in spent isolation have not equipped him with the tools necessary to judge right from wrong
hes had no context
hes been completely without guidance
furthermore his work the garden sculptures hair styles and so forth
indicate that hes a highly imaginative
it seems clear that his awareness of what we call reality is radically underdeveloped
but will he be all right out there
hell be fine
to edward listen
it could keep me up all night worrying about you
roadside i heard this noise and ran out in my bathrobe
all along i felt in my gut
there was something wrong with him
it could have been my house
it could have been any of our houses
i warned you didnt i
i saw the sign of satan on him
you didnt heed my warning
but now you will because now you see it too
reporters approach edward and peg
you stay here
what do you say in your defense
he didnt want to talk
you have to say something
he cant talk right now
to edward so were you set up
what was going through your mind
we have to get in the house
we dont want to talk to you
well talk to you later
well for goodness sakes lois ill see you at our christmas party
before i get you here for your haircut
of course well have it this year
why wouldnt we have it this year
well you may think that but youre wrong
they didnt hurt you did they
were you scared
i tried to make jim go back but you cant make jim do anything
thank you for not telling them about me
you are welcome
it must have been awful when they told you whose house it was
i know it was jims house
well then why did you do it
because you asked me to
jim called out for kim
whats the matter with you
when you are going to stop
i did what i could
my old man think hes retarded otherwise hed still be in jail
what more do you want from me
you could tell the truth
so could do
you were there too
it wasnt my idea
you know i didnt want to do it
but you did do it
i dont get why you give such a shit anyway
well we are going to try to help you find a way to replace the drapes and the towels but our confidence in you edward is not going to be
so easy to replace
okay a little ethics
you are walking down the street
you find a suitcase full of money
theres nobody around
no human person is in evidence
what do you do
a you keep the money
b you use it to buy gifts for your friends and your loved ones
c you give it to the poor
d you turn it into the police
that is really stupid
i keep the money
hey how about after dinner we go down to the bowling alley
that will be fun
you are not seeing jim tonight
you know we had a cool show and tell today
this kid brought in a box of baby possums
no hair at all
honey this is fascinating
but i dont think your fathers finished yet
thank you dear
edward we are waiting
give it to my loved ones
oh edward it does seem that thats what you should do bit its not
you dope everybody knows hes supposed to give it to the police
good thinking kevin
well think about it you guys i mean thats the nicer thing to do
thats what i would do
were trying to make things easier for him so lets cut the comedy for a little while
i am being serious
its a nicer thing to do
were not talking nice
were talking right and wrong
oh goodness sake no wonder poor edward cant learn right from wrong living in his family
margie and women on the phone
did you hear what he did to pegs curtains
it is unbelievable that theyre having their christmas party anyway
are you going
oh i dont think so
he practically raped joyce you know threatening her with those knives
its a miracle she escaped
i dont have anything against bill and peg but
i know i know
theyve got that teenage daughter in the house
oh those poor things after what happened to me can you imagine
what do you say to peg about the christmas party
i said i hoped
wed make it
i lied too
pegs living room edward do you want to give me that new haircut
it makes me proud to have you as my own personal hairdresser
kevin you want to play scissors paper stone
im tired of always winning
other peoples feelings
ill be outside
a few manners
just never you mind
just you cut away
it needs something else
what do you think honey
mom do you really think that we should be having this party
of course i think we should be having this party
of course i do
i mean as just what we need is just to calm things down and then everything will just go back to normal
do you have any more bells honey
kim goes out into the garden and sees edward sculpture an ice mass
when he sculptures it snowflakes begin to fall and kim dances in the snow
after he finishes it he cuts her hand by accident
then jim shows up

edward who sees it saves kevin but many people mistakenly think that edward tries to kill kevin
kim tells edward to run and he runs away
people follow him to the castle
are you ok
im your friend
get away now
somebody help us
what are you doing
get the police
somebody call the police
hey let go of me
somebody call the police
jim stop it
get off him
kevins all right
it was just the tiniest scratch
lets not bother him all right
let just leave him alone
gunshots go on run
did you get him
ok is he dead
its all over go on home
theres nothing more to see
what happened out there
its all over
i want some answers
where is he
get back here
i want to ask you something
do you see him
i want to ask you
hes in that car
look at that
i dont believe it
they dont have him
thats not a good idea
they are coming
did i hurt kevin
no hes okay
he said he was just scared
edward i was so afraid
i thought you were dead
jim fires at edward and kim tries to stop him
in their fight edward kills jim and then says good by to kim
stop it or ill kill you myself
i said stay away from her
neighbors voice goodbye
i love you
is he in there
the roof caved in on him
they killed each other
you can see for yourselves
she raises a pair of scissors
she never saw him again
not after that night
how do you know
because i was there
you could have gone up there
you still could go
im an old woman now
i would rather want him remember me the way as i was
how do you know hes still alive
i dont know
not for sure
but i believe he is
you see before he came down here it never snowed
and afterwards it did
if he werent up there now i dont think it would be snowing
sometimes you can still catch me dancing in it
