written by kate angelo august th were not exactly sure where we are
and were not exactly sure whos talking
all we know is that we are looking at a foot
one bare foot with chipped red polish
i cant believe i didnt get a pedicure for this
look at that
the toes open and then curl down as if trying to hide
whats wrong with me
if i were with a real guy doing this i wouldve gotten a pedicure
and a wax
the camera pans to the other foot which is also chipped
fuck that ones even worse
and when did my toes get so fat
no wonder im alone
im a fat toed animal
zoe lets out a sigh
she speaks out loud now
sorry i didnt get a pedicure
harris mid fifties jovial looks up from between zoes knees the light on his head flashing right in zoes eyes
im not looking at your toes
harris stands and takes off his gloves
and now for the first time we see zoe
despite the paper gown and worried look on her face shes a late something girl next door type
she could be your best friend
ill elevate your legs for ten minutes and then youre good to go
he sets a kitchen timer and then pushes a button to raise her legs
we hear the loud tick tock of the timer
this is the first time ive heard that ticking clock sound and it doesnt freak me out
i cant im totally freaking out
everythings going to be great
i have a feeling you and
checks empty syringe number crm are going to make beautiful babies together
maybe hes right
of course hes right
are you high
bobby but says hes gay and gorgeous opens a file and points to a piece of paper
says here he has red hair and freckles
and glasses too
and why are we picking him
because hes honest
zoe points to a stack of potential donors
you think theyre all telling the truth
if theyre so smart and good looking why are they beating off into a cup
have you ever fucked a guy with red hair and freckles
no and i wont have to
but what about your kid
no ones going to want to fuck your kid
beat that came out wrong
its a good thing youre not going to be the father
bobby spits out a mouthful of sauvignon blanc
i cant be the father
come on we dont have to have sex
oh jesus i didnt even think about that
rewind rewind rewind
youre one of my best friends
dont you want to help me
thats too much
ill walk your dog tell you when you look fat be honest about your eyebrows
just a few sperm
you waste billions of them every night
you know i flee at the slightest chance of intimacy
do you see these bags under my eyes
ricardo slept over last night and he wanted to hold me
i actually had to fake a seizure
forget the whole thing
zoe sighs and puts her head in her hands
forget the whole thing
its just a phase
zoe and mona zoes age but looks much older sit at the kitchen table
you dont want kids
easy for you to say
you have four
yeah and its awful
three children run through the kitchen yelling and screaming
a beat later a toddler runs after them crying
theyve ruined my life
have you seen my vagina
zoe shakes her head
do you want to
zoe shakes her head again
i would do that for you
to prove to you that you dont want to have kids i will show you my vagina
i dont want to see your vagina
i want a baby
my own baby
is it possible youre just a little lonely
you know you havent met the right guy and its not about a guy
i dont need a guy
i dont even think i want a guy at this point
ive dated a hundred guys in the last five years and not one of them is even close to being the one
how long am i supposed to wait
you never know
he could be right around the corner
well then hes late
and i hate people who are late
and what if hes not right around the corner
what if hes miles away
zoe shakes her head
she becomes very serious
i want to have a baby
and time is running out
i hear a clock ticking every time i close my eyes
i need it to stop
we hear a loud ding
zoe opens her eyes
were back in the exam room
she looks at the timer which just hit zero
then a tear forms in the corner of her eye
she wipes it away
she wipes a tear from the other eye
then she looks at her legs high above her on the table
how the fuck am i supposed to get down from here
zoe walks down the hall with her legs pressed firmly together moving only from the knees down
you dont have to walk like that
zoe separates her legs an inch
and then closes them
should we hug
we might have just made a baby together
zoe walks through the waiting room with her legs still pressed together
she sees two pregnant woman touches her own stomach and smiles
she finally feels part of this exclusive baby club
zoe enters the elevator where there is a woman holding a baby
zoe smiles at them
another member of the club
the elevator descends
zoe continues to stare at the baby with a big smile
she stares for an uncomfortably long time
youre starting to freak me out
zoe looks down
after a beat she sneaks another look
its pouring outside
the kind of rain that turns umbrellas inside out
new yorkers run for cover with newspapers over their heads
despite the rain zoe skips out of the building with her hands in the air and twirls around
realizing that shes spread her legs too far apart she snaps them back together
a woman pushing a baby stroller covered in plastic runs by
zoe looks uptown for a cab
she starts to walk still keeping her legs firmly pressed together
she rounds the corner towards the subway station and then miraculously spies a cab
she runs little steps across the street
zoe closes the door behind her
as soon as the word comes out of her mouth she notices someone entering the cab from the other side
this is stan early s but looks more like a college kid faded jeans t shirt cute messy hair
this is my cab
you own it
no but im about to rent it
actually if were being technical you kind of stole it
i dont think so
if you see someone about to get in a cab you cant just run in from the other side and say its yours
i didnt see you
i saw you see me
to the cabbie sir who saw you first
the cabbie picks up his paper and starts to read
maybe youre not from around here but theres a code
its like war even though its brutal and bloody there are still certain rules we fine
ill get out
zoe grabs the door handle and then turns back
but not because youre right but because i am in a terrific mood and you are ruining it
ill get out
they each get out
zoe and stan stand on opposite sides of the taxi in the pouring rain
zoe crosses her arms
i dont know
you tell me
that question is answered by the cabbie who now peels out
wheres he going
waving her hands then come back
they both stand there with a taxis width between them
well that was stupid
whyd you get out you stupid head
you said you were in a great mood and i was ruining it
i felt bad
then did you just call me stupid head
zoe storms off with her little steps
stan and zoe each swipe their metrocards at the same time
they enter the subway platform which is jam packed with all the other new yorkers who are shit out of luck in the cab department
rain droplets drip from the ceiling above
hows your great mood now
a packed subway car
zoe and stan are back to back pushed together by the crowd
zoe tries to read her paper
how bout now
please stop talking to me
zoe and stan walk up the stairs a few feet apart from each other
zoe does her best to ignore the obvious
so why are you in such a good mood anyway
they reach the top of the stairs
the rain has stopped and the sun is just starting to peek through
everything is wet and has a magical quality
not that its any of your business but
good things are happening to me
stan is moved by this
what a thing to say
i hope it continues
well have a nice life
try not to steal any more cabs
you do the same
they nod and separate
hudson pets is a small but quaint west village pet store filled with dogs cats and a few rabbits
her dog nuts a raggedy pug like dog with hind legs in a wheelchair bounds wheels towards her barking
hows it going
she gives nuts a good scratch
jalisa mid s latina hottie and bobby run from the back
oh my god youre glowing
to jalisa shes glowing right
tell us everything
theres not much to tell
you just got shot up with a wad of red headed freckle sperm
theres something to tell
he had red hair and freckles
i tried to talk her out of it
whyd you do that mami
to jalisa i know right
im never going to see his pubes
youll see your kids pubes
i doubt it
but youll know theyre there
what is wrong with you
so what happened
i lay down put my feet up five minutes later it was over
i barely felt a thing
sounds like ricardo
tell me about it papi
bobby and jalisa high five
bobby then turns to zoe
what happens now
now we wait
thats no fun i want to know if im going to be a fairy godmother
well just have to wait and see
zoe smiles and heads for the back
the lights in the pet store go dark
moments later zoe bobby jalisa and nuts exit
come on zoe one drink
you can have an odhouls or something
well go to the piano bar and get bobby to sing some ace of base
forget it shes not coming
i can tell by the dull look on her face
they all hug
bobby and jalisa walk away arm in arm singing
i saw the sign and it opened up my eyes i saw the sign
zoe turns to lock up
while her back is turned stan appears from the shadows
zoe screams and drops the keys
nuts overexcited by zoes reaction starts to run wheel in circles and then tips over
you scared the hell out of me
nuts is still on the ground his wheels spinning
zoe sets him upright
what are you doing here
i didnt mean to scare you
or hurt your dog
dont worry im not a stalker
howd you know i worked here
i followed you after the subway
thinks then that sounds a little stalkery huh
i just really wanted to see you again
almost like i had to see you again
can i walk you home
then is it me or does everything i say make me sound more like a stalker
zoe allows a small smile
can i just give you my card
take my card
im not a freak
i sell cheese
this hangs out there for a beat
my family has a goat farm
we make cheese
you like cheese
ive never really thought about it
maybe youve seen us at the farmers market
come by sometime and you can taste my cheese
then okay im going to go
this has not gone as planned
stan smiles meekly and then turns to go
stan lifts his hand to wave but doesnt even turn around
clearly he feels like an idiot
zoe watches him go
establishing shot of a cute brownstone with window boxes and a front stoop
we tilt up to the third floor window
zoe is asleep with the morning sun on her face
nuts is beside her his two little lame legs hanging off the pillow
zoe opens her eyes
after a beat she gets up and walks to the mirror
she lifts up her pajama top and looks at her stomach sticking it out as far as it will go
its flat as a board
seven women sit around the cramped living room of this small east village apartment
at least one woman is nursing a child that looks entirely too old to still be nursing
this is the single mothers by choice support group
carol s short hair tank top and no bra is the leader
everyone please say hello to zoe
welcome to single mothers by choice
as the name suggests we are all single mothers by choice
some of us have adopted some conceived with a donor every story is different but with the same common denominator
we wanted to have a child and we didnt need a partner to make it happen
the women smile and nod
they are a proud no nonsense somewhat masculine bunch
lori pregnant with a buzz cut turns to zoe
are you a doer or a tryer
are you already a single mother or are you trying to become one
oh i guess im trying
i was just inseminated a few days ago
makes me feel like a cow or something
well when we dont have partners with penises we do what weve got to do right
then so tell us a little bit about yourself
um i own a pet store on hudson street
dogs cats rabbits
no birds they creep me out
before that i worked for google which i completely hated
one day i decided life was too short and against my accountants advice i quit google cashed out and bought the pet store
now im really happy on the work front but i still havent found you know the one
the elusive one
i always imagined id be married with kids by now but it doesnt look like its going to happen that way
so time for plan b
society tells us were supposed to find that special person to make us happy and complete
but guess what
you have to create your own happiness
you dont need someone to complete you some
you already are complete
if you want to have a baby we here at single mothers by choice can be your partners
we will be your emotional rocks
zoe looks around at her new partners
theres sara the one nursing the toddler
and tabitha a tall women with an even taller afro and a nose ring
bridget a young girl covered in tatoos
and several more
from inception to college graduation and everything in between
were here for each other
sara smiles and nods at her nursing child
dakota was actually born right here in this very room
right where youre sitting actually
best day of my life
and how old is she now
dakota looks up from the breast
zoe and mona are sitting by the window sharing a plate of pastries and a pot of coffee
why did you join a support group of unattractive militant lesbians when you have me
because youre really not that supportive
sure i am
you just told me that if i breast feed my girls will end up looking like empty tube socks
im just being honest
and dont even get me started on what childbirth does to your bladder
what does it do to your bladder
mona cracks up and then stops abruptly
i just peed a little bit
i dont think im pregnant
the doctor says it will probably take several tries
something about frozen sperm being lazy
take your time
zoe takes a sip of coffee and looks out the window
so should i call this guy
do you think that would be weird
do i think its weird that youre pursuing someone at the exact moment in time that you might be most unavailable
because thats what you do
ignoring her he works at the farmers market
and its right around the corner
are you thinking what im thinking
i look fat and old
lets go spy on him
it will be fun
like high school
checks watch this twenty minute breakfast concludes my me time for the week
more proof that you should not have kids
the farmers market is crowded with people
we hear the sounds of a bluegrass band playing somewhere nearby
zoe spies the little goat sign
but stan is not there
she looks around the neighboring stalls for him but no luck
she walks towards th street
we see the bluegrass band on the steps by the subway station
its not a big band just a few guys with an open banjo case and a sign that reads the organics
the country twang of the music is in sharp contrast with the tall buildings all around
as she gets closer she notices that stan is in the band
hes playing banjo
zoe quickly ducks into the nearest food stall olivias berries
olivia mid twenties natural beauty approaches
can i help you
distracted no im fine
zoe watches stan
she mindlessly starts eating some blueberries out of the display pint
olivia sees that zoe is looking at stan
zoe nods and takes another berry
all ripe and juicy
and firm too
bet you could just eat him up in one bite right
zoe now turns confused
and dont look now but hes coming this way
olivia winks and moves off
zoe turns back and is now face to face with stan whos smiling from ear to ear his banjo slung over his shoulder
i didnt scare you away after all
trying to be casual i was just in the neighborhood
i thought id come by and get some blueberries
im going to make a pie
i love blueberry pie
stan takes two pints of blueberries and hands them to zoe
i thought you made cheese or something
what makes you think i dont
i dont know youre over there playing the banjo
cant someone do both
honestly i didnt know anyone did either
arent you going to introduce me to your new friend
to zoe come on
let me show you around
stan puts his arm around zoe and leads her away
olivia watches them go with her arms crossed
stan walks zoe through his cheese stand
this is our basic chevre probably our best seller
the cheese that started it all as they say
then over here we have our surface ripened cheeses
these are the aged raw milk cheeses
realizing this is really boring huh
no not at all
its like youre in a foreign country and the only thing to watch on tv is a documentary on cheese
you dont want to watch it but somehow you cant stop
laughing i think its interesting
all right you asked for it
boring voice the aged raw milk cheeses are made from raw milk and then aged for four to six months
depends on the cheese
youre killing me
fred early twenties white guy with rasta type dreads looks up from behind the counter
fred zoe zoe fred
then shes the one i followed from the subway the other day like a total psychopath
i heard about you
i dont know whether to be flattered or terrified
dont scare her away
im trying to redeem myself
then you should put down the banjo
you look like a doofus
then to zoe do you think i look like a doofus
i dont really know what a doofus looks like
fred points to stan
if i put the banjo down can i take you to lunch or something
i should really get back to work
come on say the word and we can have a six course tasting menu at union square cafe
i know the chef
that sounds nice but i should probably go
well can i call you
zoe enters the pet store with two big bags of vegetables
as soon as she steps foot in the store bobby and jalisa accost her
okay spill it
who is he
what does he do
how do we know him
what are you talking about
stan from the farmers market
hes called twice already
is he a farmer
because thats not okay
he makes cheese
hes a pilgrim
i dont know what he is
hes cute and different and plays the banjo
then i think i like him
what about the you know bun in the oven
i really doubt im pregnant
you want to be pregnant
you dont want to be pregnant
i want to be pregnant
of course i want to be pregnant
i mean i put a lot of thought into this right
then so what did stan say
he says to name any restaurant you want to go to
hell be there with bells on
then he didnt say the bells on part
i added that
sounds a little too gay though so i take it back
zoe walks down th street
this is the first time weve seen her really pulled together and she looks hot
she turns into the restaurant shes chosen for the big date
zoe and stan stand at the counter with an array of hot dogs in front of them
stan looks at the hot dogs skeptically
we could have gone anywhere
just take a bite
per se jean georges nobu
she clinks his dog and then they each take a bite
stan nods covering his mouth because the bite is so big
youve lived here your whole life and never been to grays papaya
whats wrong with you
i actually havent lived here my whole life
we moved out of the city when my parents bought the farm
not died but actually bought a farm and moved upstate
that must have been a nice place to grow up
on a farm
what about your family
its just me and my grandmother
she lives in a retirement community in queens
an awkward beat my parents died when i was young
im so sorry
there is a long silence
they both stare at the hot dogs
i dont know what to say now
ive made it all awkward and sad
then my dad was kind of a bad guy anyway
im so sorry zoe
no come on well get all this stuff out of the way so we never have to talk about it again
lets ask all the awkward get to know you questions right now
are you religious
what about you
have you ever been married
arent you sick of going to weddings
if i have to listen to one more couple write their own vows
i hate when they write their own vows
they clasp hands
not in a high fivey way but in a connected we have so much in common way
their hands stay together feeling the charge between them
what about kids
zoe feels the blood rush to her cheeks
like everyone there must now be looking at her
what about them
well do you want them
i want kids
she pulls her hand away
this has all gotten suddenly real
she looks at stan almost afraid to ask the next question
slowly she starts to breathe again
they are now walking home together arm in arm
okay first kiss
she wore a head gear
what about you
i think his name was stan interrupts by kissing her
and its a great kiss
full of promises and answers
they linger there for a moment
that was way better
when can i see you again
zoe feels her heart jump
she kisses him again
zoe is lying in bed with nuts on the pillow next to her
the sun is shining and they are both waking up
she gets up and goes to the mirror
she lifts up her nightgown and looks at her stomach this time with a slight look of concern on her face
zoe and mona are side by side on the elliptical machines
zoe is going very fast while mona is barely moving at all
what if im pregnant
then youll get fat and hormonal and ill say i told you so
but what if this could go somewhere with stan
like really go somewhere
then it will work out perfectly
what do you mean
because just when you really like him youll break up because youre pregnant and then you never have to put yourself out there and possibly get hurt
thats your dream
thinks then im not pregnant
she gets off the machine
we are in a foggy steam room with zoe mona and a few other so when are you seeing him again
well dont have sex with him
thats the last thing we need
you get knocked up and well have no idea who the father is
a few women look over
and then well have to do a paternity test
is it the cheese farmer or the red pubed bandit
more women look over
im not going to have sex with him tonight
its too soon
for the womens benefit im not a slut
well bring condoms just in case
thinks then and a pregnancy test
im not joking
all of the women are now staring at zoe
im really not a slut
zoe sits on the bed holding a pregnancy test in her hands
nuts is beside her
he looks up at her
theres no way right
zoe pees on the stick
nuts is beside her watching with his head tilted
stop looking at me like that
im not pregnant
zoe finishes peeing and looks at the test
come on come on come on
we hear the doorbell ring
zoe looks down at the test
we wait and watch the test
the doorbell rings again
a faint plus sign is forming
the plus sign then turns bright pink
zoes heart stops
there it is
plain as day
looks at herself in the mirror
holy fucking shit
manhattan fades into the distance as they drive over the brooklyn bridge
zoe cracks the window
are you feeling okay
her face looks pale
good because this should really be a culinary adventure
this is an underground restaurant that moves from apartment to apartment depending on the chef
zoe nods again
hasnt heard a word hes said
she rolls the window all the way down and hangs her head out
and some of the guys from the band will be there
so we might get a little jam going
sounds fun right
headlights from passing cars whiz by and the wind swirls her hair into her face
brooklyn approaches like a bad dream
stan walks down a long table filled with appetizers
he is making a plate for each of them
zoe trails behind beads of sweat on her forehead
and this looks like a mache salad with grapes and feta
he takes some for each of them
and this oh this must be white beans and lambs tongue
youve got to have some of this
etienne is famous for his lambs tongue
oh hey olivia
you remember zoe
howd that blueberry pie turn out
you bought blueberries from me
said you were going to make a pie
um can you excuse me for a second
zoe hurries off
olivia watches her go
no way she knows how to bake a pie
zoe hovers by the window whispering into the phone
where are you
im on my way
zoe hangs up the phone
zoe is now on the phone with mona
could be a false positive
take another test
im at some underground foodie party in brooklyn
where am i gonna out the window and across the street we see a drugstore
zoe runs down the aisle and empties one two three
what the fuck every pregnancy test into her basket
her cell phone rings
she picks it up
okay im looking at a subway map
which way is brooklyn
she hangs up again
zoe hurries through the living room a packed drugstore bag hidden under her arm
stan comes up behind her
where have you been
zoe jumps and accidentally drops the bag
the tests spill out onto the floor
she quickly scoops everything back in
you scared me
did you just go to the store
yeah i had a little emergency
i have a a um
corn and i needed to get those little
i know its gross
do you know where the bathroom is
zoe walks off leaving him to ponder
whats a corn pad
zoe pees on eight sticks at once
what the hell is wrong with you
someone knocks on the door
the knocking turns to an angry banging
ill be out in
checks box three to five minutes
zoe holds up the tests
one by one the little windows all show plus signs and check marks and double hash marks
zoe exits the bathroom with a wide eyed terrified look on her face
by the bar she sees a pregnant woman sipping a glass of wine
she rushes over
excuse me are you allowed to drink when youre
zoe makes hand motions at her belly but cant say the word
more hand gestures
off zoes nod my doctor says one glass is zoe doesnt wait for her to finish
she rushes the bar pours a glass of wine and downs it like a frat boy funneling a beer
outside we hear a banjo and guitar tuning up
stan jerry and scooter are just starting to play
a small crowd gathers round
stan starts to sing an old tune called sweet little miss blue eyes
who makes me forget all the other girls i met sweet little miss blue eyes
whos sweeter to me than she really ought to be sweet little miss blue eyes
zoe appears at the door to the patio
stan smiles at her while he sings
whos gonna start takin care of my heart she makes me realize
and its lucky for me and i really want to be with
winks at zoe sweet little miss stans pov as zoe covers her mouth with two hands and bolts for the bathroom puking
zoes head is in the toilet
just when we think shes done she pukes again
finally she lifts her head
she spies an unused pregnancy test on the floor
one that must have dropped
maybe this will be the one with the answer shes looking for
she sits back on the toilet mustering up all of her focus to pee again
she closes her eyes
but she cant pee
she tries and tries
water water everywhere but not a drop to
she doubles over and pukes between her knees
when shes done she holds up the test
cu of the stick which has no pee on it but is covered in vomit
slowly the test reveals a plus sign
stan and zoe walk towards zoes brownstone
stan is practically holding her up
zoe stumbles along
my singing made you vomit
its not that
sure we were a little out of tune but
i really dont feel well
is it your corns
hurts to walk
angle on carol from single mothers by choice approaching
zoes face pales
where have you been
you havent been coming to any cutting her off right
ive been so busy
next one im there
then awkward this is my friend stan
eyeing stan suspiciously hello
are you two late
we really are
pushing stan along ill see you at the meeting
they walk on
stan looks at zoe
her name is carol
were on a
they reach zoes front stoop
zoe peers over stans shoulder to make sure carols gone
i have to go to bed now
ill call you okay
then hey i was thinking if you dont have any plans this weekend maybe youd like to come up to the farm and get away for a few days
ill call you tomorrow
somethings not agreeing with me
was it the lambs tongue
zoe runs inside holding her hand over her mouth
stan stands there for a beat
he calls after her
think about it
zoe lies in bed
nuts sleeps beside her
zoe stares out the window at a flickering street lamp her face full of fear
what the hell have i done
establishing shot of a retirement compound in queens
the lobby is well appointed and cheery
a young staff works behind a front desk area
were it not for a scattering of people in wheelchairs you might think we were at a ramada
zoe walks by the front desk
annie an employee looks up
you look fantastic
i dont know how thats possible
did you get highlights or a spray tan
your face looks like its
please dont say glowing
there is a small group of women speed walking around the courtyard
they are fully decked out in jogging suits visors and nose shields
the ringleader is nana fit and fabulous
on the sidelines is arthur with his walker and big grin as he watches the ladies exercise
hello my dear
he struggles to get up
no no no dont get up
good because i cant get up
came to see my lovely fiance
shes looking fine today let me tell you
nana rounds the bend and waves enthusiastically
one more mile to go
do you have a minute
talk to arthur
zoe looks at arthur whos now watching nanas ass nodding
thats what im talking about
horrified zoe quickly runs after nana
zoe is now speed walking with the ladies
she mimics the same strong arm movements and heel toe foot action
do you want a nose guard
i have an extra
no im fine
are you sure
ethel silverbeck just had another carcinoma removed from her nose
to nana i kind of need to talk to you
nana gives her friends a nod and they fall back several paces
zoe waits for them to be out of earshot
dont worry they cant hear anything anyway
cant hear her what
i cant hear you darling
jesus judy shes pregnant
turn your hearing aide up
zoe closes her eyes
nana hands zoe a cup of tea
zoes eyes well with tears
what am i going to do
isnt this what you wanted
you bought sperm and were inseminated by your doctor
this isnt what we would call an accident
but now its all happening so fast
did i really think this through
we talked about it for months
you said it was what you wanted more than anything in the world
but this guy hes
its all going to fall apart now
what makes him so special
i dont know
the other guys ive been with all had their briefcases and their five year plans and their secretaries they were fucking
stan doesnt have a five year plan
i dont even know if he has a plan
what about a secretary
some kid named fred
then i like him nana
well if hes the right one hell stay
do you really think so
gosh i dont know
i hoped that would be enough to appease you
should i still visit him for the weekend
or should i just vanish and hope he forgets i ever existed
dont be silly
go up there for the weekend
spend some time with him and see what hes really like
you might find out hes a total douchebag and then the whole thing is moot
zoe looks at nana
zoe is in the car
we are close on her as she talks rapidly and a bit maniacally
okay so well just hope that hes a douchebag
could happen right
widen to reveal nuts in the passenger seat
am i keeping you up
nuts closes his eyes and lays down
my whole life is falling apart and you cant keep your bug eyes open
now im yawning
but why am i so tired
i slept nine hours
thinks then and im starving too
what the hell is going on
zoe sees a gas station and jams on the breaks
zoe pours a massive cup of coffee
one of those gas station big gulp cups
even the trucker next to her chooses a smaller cup
then a look crosses her face
am i even allowed to drink coffee
the trucker looks at her
she looks at him
do you know anything about being pregnant
zoes car is now parked on the side of a highway in the middle of nowhere
zoe is sound asleep with her head back and her mouth open
a small empty coffee cup in her hand crumpled candy bar wrappers on the floor and an almost empty bag of cheetos is in her lap
her cell phone rings
zoe doesnt move
after the third ring she lifts her head and looks around
it takes her a few moments to realize whats happened
she looks at the little coffee cup
thanks a lot decaf
she picks up the phone
where are you
zoe looks around
i have no idea
zoe bumps along the winding driveway of this idyllic hudson river farm
there are red barns in the distance and green pastures filled with goats and sheep
the house is an old carriage house with a rusty weather vane on top
zoe parks the car and takes in the whole scene
stan opens the front door with a huge smile on his face
hes so not a douchebag
they enter the front door
zoe takes in the charming carriage house
i cant believe you live here
this is ridiculous
i just come on weekends
my parents really live here
where are they now
in the kitchen
zoe stops short
wait theyre here
is this a meet the parents kind of thing
i wasnt prepared for this
not at all
i mean youll meet them but when you said come up for the weekend i assumed it was just us
then i think i need to lay down
zoe lies in the small bed with the covers pulled up to her chin
stan stands above her with an odd look on his face
are you hung over or something
give me ten minutes
a ten minute power nap and im good
i need to regroup
are you sure youre okay
but shes already out
stan gives her a little poke
stan enters the kitchen
his parents joan and edward look up expectantly as if about to meet their new daughter in law
its just you
shes taking a nap
she just got here
mom i need you to not be judgemental okay
i like this girl a lot
how can i be judgemental
we havent even met her yet
we hear a squeak squeak squeak coming down the hall
what the heck is that
the squeaking continues and then all eyes turn as nuts rolls into the kitchen and stops
he tilts his head
this is nuts
joan and edward take in the raggedy wheelchair bound dog and then look at stan
stan shoots his mom a look
its now dark
zoe is asleep in the exact same position
suddenly we hear a loud grumble
her eyes open
what was that
we hear the grumble again
its her stomach
she puts her hands over it
zoe gets out of bed and goes right for the cheetos
the bag is empty
she smears her hand on the inside of the bag and then licks the orange cheese from her fingers
zoe peeks out of the bedroom and looks both ways
no one in sight
she waits a beat and then whispers louder
zoe peers her head into the empty kitchen
nuts is with her
zoe stands there unsure of what to do next
then we hear her stomach growl again
her eyes turn to the stove
something smells out of this world
she tiptoes over and opens the pot
its beef stew
oh my god
she makes sure the coast is clear and then looks for a spoon
she cant find one
she spies a loaf of white bread
grabs a piece folds it and then scoops up a heaping bite of stew and devours it
mouth full oh my god
she replaces the lid on the pot
and now she just stands there
and stands there some more
oh who am i kidding
she quickly takes two slices of bread and goes back in
this time she uses one piece of bread as a ladle and then the other to turn it into a sandwich
she takes a huge bite
stew dribbles down her chin
she takes a third piece of bread to wipe her face and then takes a bite of that one
nuts starts to whine and beg
zoe uses her bread ladle to toss some stew on the floor for him
it lands with plop
and now joan enters
zoe and nuts turn their mouths bursting
joan doesnt quite know what to do
all she knows is shes supposed to be open minded
would you like a plate
zoe shakes her head no
this is embarrassing
zoe nods her head
joan gives her one
zoe holds it over her mouth as she tries in vain to swallow this inhuman bite
still cant swallow the bite
and you must be zoe
zoe nods again
she tries to shake joans hand
its the best she can do
unfortunately her fingers are fluorescent orange from the cheetos powder
joan pulls her hand back
the dining room is warm and lovely
theres faded wallpaper and an old stagecoach lamp serving as a chandelier
despite the inviting room zoe looks very uncomfortable
the stew is delicious honey
yeah mom its awesome
to zoe have you ever in your life had stew like this
come on be honest
zoe looks at joan
it will be their secret
they are having coffee and dessert in the living room
things seem more comfortable now
zoe actually looks like she might be enjoying herself
nuts sits beside her
so are all the animals in your pet store
oh you can say paralyzed
he doesnt mind
then no our pets are all in great shape
purebreads mostly but not from puppy mills
those puppy mills are terrible
i read about them in the paper
well thats actually how i ended up with nuts
i bought him from this pet store near my house
six months later i had thousands of dollars in vet bills and had to put him in a wheelchair
you should have sued that place
i thought about it but what was that really going to do
they were still going to sell inbred dogs
i took the money i made when i left google and just bought the place figuring i would do better
you worked for google
how could i not know that
you never asked
and you made a lot of money and then bought a pet store
stan puts his arm around her and gives her a squeeze
i love that
its been fun
beats brand management thats for sure
to edward that sounds like us honey
to zoe when we bought this farm we just wanted to make cheese because we couldnt find anything we liked in the stores
and now twenty years later here we are
sometimes in life you just have to take matters into your own hands
make things happen your own way you know
zoe forces a smile
if only they knew
the moon is full and fireflies dot the air as zoe and stan walk the grounds of the farm
nuts trots rolls ahead of them in a different wheelchair
this one is more rugged with mountain bike type wheels
i cant believe that nuts has an off road wheelchair
hes got one for snow too
with little skis on the bottom
stan smiles and shakes his head
youre really something
are you making fun of me
do you think i spoil him
no i really think youre amazing
i mean that story you told tonight
you just quit your whole professional life because of this little dog
started your own business just like that
well youre a dime a dozen
i cant tell you how many banjo playing cheese makers ive been with
i keep waiting for the other shoe to drop
like how can you be so perfect
why are you even still single
i cant believe no ones snatched you up by now
i drive them all away i guess
stan takes her in his arms
look i know this is all going fast
the time were spending together meeting my parents and everything
but im okay with that
i want it to go fast
it is going fast
but isnt that okay
arent we old enough to skip all the bullshit
what are we waiting for
want to be with you
zoe opens her mouth
shes got to tell him
before this goes any further she has to tell him
theres something i want to show you
its floor to ceiling wooden shelves all filled with cheese
stan ceremoniously unwraps a wheel
what is it
i can see that
its a new kind of goats milk were using
ive been developing the recipe and now it needs to age
itll be ready for market in several months
then excited want to know what its called
you named a piece of cheese after me
not just one piece
the whole line
this will forever in history be known as the zoe
unless of course it tastes like shit and then well just scrap it
with a wink but thatll never happen
how do you know
because its going to be fantastic
sweet and sassy and very complex
why do you think im calling it zoe
no ones ever named a piece of cheese after me before
zoe stares at the cheese for a long time
youre kind of hard to read right now
youre either seriously flattered or totally repulsed
i want to kiss you right now but it really smells like cheese in here
the door to the dairy kicks open and stan carries zoe out
her legs are around his waist and they are making out like crazy
stan carries zoe up the stairs
they are tripping and kissing and now tearing at each others clothes
stan throws zoe on the bed and then peels off his shirt
his body looks amazing in the shadowy moonlight
zoe lies there looking at him before he jumps on top of her
under her breath youre such a douchebag
zoe shakes her head and then melts into him
they are now on their backs staring at the ceiling
they look happy and worn out their p
those little glow in the dark star stickers are all over the ceiling
theres barely any glow left
stan lets out a big sigh as he looks at the stars
that was amazing
i mean like totally and exceptionally over the top amazing
zoe turns to him
takes a deep breath
theres something i really have to tell you
theres something i have to tell you too
now stan turns to her
they are face to face
can i go first
cause if were going to say the same thing i want to say it first
were not going to say the same thing
well let me go because this is really embarrassing and i just have to say it
ive dated a lot of women
i mean not tons but a lot
and the thing is ive never
been in love before
ive never even told anyone i love them before
because i just never felt it
but from the day we met from the first time our backs accidentally touched in the subway i feel this this
he shakes his head maybe this is too much to say right now but
i love you zoe
i really do
he looks at her and smiles
zoe just stares at him
in my mind you were supposed to say i love you too
instead zoe covers her mouth and runs to the bathroom
a beat later we hear her vomit
zoe is at the sink furiously brushing her teeth
he looks at her
sees the tears in her eyes
why are you crying
sure it is
zoe takes a deep breath
uh im pretty sure it doesnt happen that fast
zoe shakes her head
i just found out
as in youre going to have a baby
i dont understand
its hard to explain
well whos it
i dont know
i dont know who the father is
i kind of know him
i just dont know his name exactly
it was sort of anonymous
hes a donor
from a sperm bank
seriously what the fuck are you talking about
i know this is so fucked up
when did all of this happen
the day we met
that same day
and i didnt tell you because i didnt think there was any way i could be pregnant
because supposedly with frozen sperm it takes a few tries and
no why would you do this
because i wanted a baby
and im almost forty and i never met the right guy
i was afraid if i waited any longer it would all pass me by and id miss my chance
stan just looks at her
i didnt know you
i would have never done it if i just told you i loved you
do you not now
dont say it like that
i tell you im in love with you and you tell me your pregnant with some strangers child
dont say it like that
you make it sound dirty
i dont know what to say
what the fuck am i supposed to say
this is great fucking news
why did you wait so long to tell me
because im freaking out okay
i didnt know what to do
i made this big decision to do this and then i met you well what am i supposed to do now
this isnt how it was supposed to be
this isnt what im sorry
im sorry okay
life isnt perfect
its not all neat and tidy like your perfect family and your perfect farm and your bluegrass band
its fucked up
this is real life okay
im sorry to break it to you
they both stand there
after the raised voices the silence feels more pronounced
whats sorry going to do
stan walks out
zoe stands there
and stands there
and then she starts to cry
zoe lies in bed awake
nuts is beside her
they are alone
its daybreak at the farm
farm hands move herds of goats from one pasture to another
stan lies awake in a small guest room
joan enters and is startled to find him in there
oh i thought you were in your room
then everything okay
stan doesnt answer
joan sits on the corner of the bed
well she seems really terrific
dad and i both think so
shes smart and poised and
next door we hear zoe puking again
then wanting to seem open minded continues
and warm and gracious
another very loud hurl
and pretty and
joan looks at stan
what the hells going on in there
oh dear god
we hear the toilet flush
zoe sits in the passenger seat with the key in the ignition
stan leans against the car
they are both quiet
i dont know what to say
neither does stan who says nothing
he runs his foot back and forth in the gravel
i guess id given up on meeting someone like you and i did what i thought was best
stan still doesnt say anything
but for what its worth
i love you too
she puts the car in gear and pulls out
stan watches her go
his hands in his pockets
zoe stands in the hallway of monas apartment building
a beat later mona opens the door and holds out her arms
zoe walks slowly into her embrace
they stand like this for a long time
just holding each other
until monas three kids run out with wiffle ball bats and chase each other down the hall
a beat later the toddler runs after them crying
zoe lies in bed with nuts
she opens her eyes and stares at the ceiling
then with a sigh she gets up and does her morning ritual
she pulls up her nightgown and sticks out her stomach
for the first time we actually see a little bump
zoe lies on the table with a paper gown over her lap
she looks down at her feet in the stirrups
sadly we notice a perfect pedicure
harris comes in with a big smile
what luck to get pregnant on the first try huh
and with frozen sperm too
so how are we feeling
you sure about that
its been hard
i dont know if i was really prepared for this
well your hormones arent helping and going through this without a partner must be difficult
harries readies the ultrasound wand and inserts the device
he turns the monitor so that zoe can see
well the good news is everything looks great
you are now eight weeks pregnant which is an important milestone
with a little luck we should be able to see a heartbeat today
on the screen we see a small flickering dot
saying these words out loud for the first time hits zoe
tears fill her eyes
then is it okay
is it healthy
makes a face then wait a minute
wait a minute what
i see another heartbeat
freaking out it has two hearts
but you have two babies
zoes mouth falls open
were back at single women by choice
the women are sitting on the floor
sara is still nursing dakota
zoe has her head in her hands
zoe bursts into tears
why are you crying
thats so lucky
lucky lucky me
the women are sensing the sarcasm but not getting it
are you okay
is it a financial concern
there are many programs no
im fairly loaded actually
used to work for google
blows nose im sorry
this is hard for me
i dont know if i can talk about it yet
take your time
when you feel like sharing were here for you
were all sisters here
then to the group lets give zoe some space
when shes ready to talk were ready to listen
deep cleansing breaths zoe
carol takes a deep breath and then lets it out
now in the meantime does anyone else have anything they want to discuss
tabitha the tall woman with the nose ring raises her hand
im having a hard time
luca keeps asking why he doesnt have a daddy and i just dont know what blurting out theres this guy
his name is stan
and hes fantastic
i knew it
wasnt i just speaking
i knew you were with that guy
zoe this group is called single mothers by choice
im sorry um excuse me
what about luca
hes been really really sad
floodgates opening have you ever met a guy and you get butterflies and you think this is the kind of man who could take care of me forever
the kind of guy who makes you re examine everything
like maybe i can be a stay at home mom and be barefoot and pregnant
the women stare blankly at zoe
he actually lives on a farm
plays the banjo
maybe i could learn to sew and take care of the animals
like laura ingalls
even dakota stops nursing and looks over at that one
the women file out
no one dares look at zoe
its very awkward although zoe seems unaware
she turns to carol
carol thank you
this has been really helpful
just getting it all out and being with other women who im going to have to ask you not to come back
i dont think we can help you and quite frankly youre against everything we stand for
but i thought we were all sisters
then do you know how long it took me to conceive
i had three miscarriages and spent every last dime on in vitro
the woman with the short hair
the one with the really short hair
yeah that doesnt really narrow it down much
she just flew to memphis to watch her baby being born
seconds after the birth the birth mother changed her mind and refused to give it up
zoes face changes
she starts to get it
so as you can see we are really dedicated and choosing to be single mothers and you seem to be in a slightly different place
youre carrying two healthy babies and you have no idea how lucky you are
after a beat youre right
i like you zoe
we all like you
but you kind of need to figure out where you are
zoe and nana are walking the loop around the courtyard
zoe looks terrible
like she hasnt slept in days
they complete a lap
arthur gives them the double thumbs up sign
that man is obsessed with my ass
its kind of upsetting
he wants to take me on a cruise so that we can finally tie the knot
but i dont know
whats the hurry
youve been engaged for nine years
no reason to rush into anything
nana looks over at zoe
she sees the bags under her eyes
you look terrible dear
you must really love him huh
i guess i do
honey im sure hes wonderful and im sure he loves you too
but you have put him in a really awkward position
having a baby is a big adjustment for any couple
and youre not married
and hes not the father
and youve only been together a little while
and now youre having twins
and please stop
im just saying if he actually wanted to stay with you right now hed be the greatest man in the world and quite frankly i dont think any man is
they complete another lap around the courtyard
arthur smiles at them and then raises the roof
arthurs just about the best man i know and look at him
hes a fucking idiot
stan leans against the fence looking at the goats
he has the beginnings of a beard growing
the scruff makes him look older
joan approaches and stands next to him for a bit
you know people thought we were crazy when we bought this farm
all of our friends in new york they thought wed lost our minds
we get the feeling hes heard this before
i guess im saying that you may have envisioned your life going one way but the reality is it could go a totally different direction
you just have to be open to it
stan watches a nearby goat coaxing her baby to nurse
having a baby with someone i barely know someone elses baby
its just not how i pictured it
i used to work on wall street
now i wear boots covered in goat shit
this isnt how i pictured it either
but guess what
she gives him a sympathetic hug and walks away
stan lies in bed looking up at the stars
theres even less glow now than last time
he sighs and then turns over to try and sleep
angle on nuts off road wheelchair in the corner of the room
stan looks at it and cant help but smile
zoe and nuts lie in the bed
they are looking at each other on the pillow
zoe scratches behind his ears
zoe goes to the mirror and does her usual
the bump is growing
for the first time we see a smile
the single mothers by choice women are sitting in their usual circle
lori is passing around a list
make sure you put your numbers down
i want to have everyones number handy in case i go into labor early
all eyes turn
she waves sheepishly
no one knows what to say
i just wanted to apologize
im sorry i got into a relationship and wasnt honest with you guys and im sorry i interrupted you tabitha
i hope luca is doing better
to carol and ive thought a lot about what you said about how lucky i am
i got into this whole situation because i wanted to have a baby
and somehow i lost sight of that
then anyway i need partners in this and i hope youll take me back
lori smiles and hands her the piece of paper
its a phone tree
im due next month but my midwife thinks i may go sooner
i want everyone to be there
are you in
zoe has her head held high and her cute belly pushed out as far as it will go
a woman with a double stroller approaches
zoe walks on
she sees her reflection in a store window and smiles
she looks like an actual pregnant person now
as she is walking and smiling to herself we hear a familiar voice
stan appears next to her in the reflection
for a brief second they look like a family
they both stop
unsure of whether to hug or what
they just stand there
you said that already
zoe touches her belly
proud but protective
how are you feeling
a long silence
you have a beard
yeah its awful isnt it
then did i tell you how pretty you look
i miss you
a group of school kids lost in their own conversations push up the block separating zoe and stan for a moment
this separation makes the moment all the more tense
i miss you too
this whole time weve been apart ive been trying to figure out what it is about you that i love so much
and i think that its that a lot of people talk about doing things but you actually do them
youre really kind of daring
how you quit your job and took over a pet store all because some asshole sold you a lame dog
you came and found me at the farmers market even though the night before i acted like a total stalker
zoe smiles at the memory
and now youre pregnant
because you wanted to have a baby and didnt think you could wait any longer
well thats just the same kind of thing
and i cant love you for being that way but then walk away for the same reason
stan takes her hands
i love you
ive been waiting my whole life for you
and i cant let one little baby get in the way of that
theres something i need to tell you
and youre allowed to take all of this back when i tell you
its not just one baby
im having twins
stan looks at her
is she joking
her look says no
he takes a beat
and then even though its not a joke he starts to laugh
a little laugh at first and then a big one
and then zoe starts laughing too
the whole thing is just so ridiculous
this is insane
zoe and stan are naked in bed lying face to face
stan puts his hand on her stomach
he feels the little bump new since hes last been with her
do you feel any kicking
what does it feel like
he likes this image
he runs his hand over her belly
zoe moves in closer
touches his cheek
are you really sure you want to do this
im really sure
they look at each other for a long time
finally zoe closes her eyes and settles in for sleep with stan watching her as she dozes off
cu of a monitor where we see two distinct baby shapes floating head to toe
harris holds the ultrasound wand to her belly
stan doesnt say anything
he looks on in total amazement
are you okay
they look like real babies
would you like to know the sexes
they look at each other
stan does too
youre having two healthy little girls
stan gets tears in his eyes
stan and zoe walk down madison avenue
all of the other new yorkers are on some kind of mission shopping rushing to meetings or fighting for cabs
but zoe and stan just walk slowly hand in hand
every so often looking at each other and just smiling or laughing
then suddenly stan picks her up in the middle of the street
a woman with a baby in a baby bjorn passes by
now hes part of this exclusive club
we pan past several small plates of food on a table
a chef tells us what delectable items we are looking at
here we have a yellowtail sashimi with ponzu sauce and pea shoots
this is carpaccio with shaved white truffles
and finally an heirloom tomato salad with fresh buratta flown in from italy this morning
it looks incredible
sam tops off their champagne and exits
stan picks up his fork and starts eating
zoe does not
arent you hungry
i cant eat any of this
pointing to each dish raw
re champagne alcohol
let me get sam back
hell make you anything you want
i dont want to hurt his feelings
you go ahead
well what are you going to eat
the cashier reads back zoes order
big mac quarter pounder with cheese four large fries and a six piece chicken mcnuggets
make that an eight no ten piece mcnuggets
to stan youll have some right
back to the cashier ten piece
someone will eat them
stan stands behind zoe with an incredulous look on his face
zoe and stan lie in bed each reading a copy of what to expect when youre expecting
zoe has the mcnuggets box on her chest
she dips each nugget in three different sauces and then takes a bite
stan watches with a mixture of amusement and revulsion
re book have you gotten to page yet
i stopped reading when you ripped out one of my pages and used it as a napkin
says here many women in the second trimester experience an increased sexual appetite
zoe smiles and then slowly triple dunks another mcnugget
she takes a seductive bite
are you coming on to me
its kind of hard to tell right now
im coming on to you
zoe throws the mcnuggets on the floor and climbs on top of him
she puts his hands on her body and then starts to kiss him voraciously
after a beat stan stops
you have chicken in your hair
zoe and mona are on the elliptical machines
zoe is going very fast while mona is barely going at all
why are you even working out
this is the one time in your life youre allowed to let it go
because look at me
i just keep getting bigger and bigger
thats kind of how it goes
im afraid im going to scare him away
im like one of those giant bouncy castles
soon im going to take over the whole back yard
he loves you for you
im just getting kind of freaked out by everything
he asked me to go to this wedding with him
what kind of first impression am i going to make on all of his friends
well youre knocked up with some strangers twins
so already youre not exactly
do you have anything to wear at least
stan dressed in a tux sits on zoes bed
he turns to the closet
everything okay in there
a cocktail dress flies out and hits him in the head
he waits a few beats
another dress flies out
honey whatever you wear is fine
i dont have anything to wear
thats the problem
another dress sails through the air
you always look great
ive never seen you not look great
stan goes to the closet
zoe is pulling on a long black dress
she tries to smush her boobs down into the top
you look hot
zoe turns to reveal the back
the two sides of the zipper are ten inches apart
do you have a shawl or something
zoe bursts into tears
a cab pulls up in front of zoes brownstone
stan opens the door for zoe who is now wearing a long silver dress
while its certainly hugging every curve and bump it looks great
you look smokin
zoe pauses in front of the open taxi door
were super late
she tries to bend at the waist but the dress is too tight
then she tries to go in butt first and swing her legs around but again the dress is too tight
why dont you sort of go in
head first and then turn around
zoe leans her head in and then has no other choice but to lie down sideways on the seat
stan tries not to laugh
shut up and push me
just do it
stan pushes her legs and zoe disappears inside the cab
zoe lies down straight across the seats like a board
i hate everyone
she sucks in her breath and tries to sit up
as soon as she bends at the waist we hear a horrific rip
she bursts into tears again
we pan over the coffee table
theres a pint of melty ben and jerrys a roll of cookie dough half eaten us weekly and the national enquirer
zoe and bobby lie on the floor looking at the ceiling
do you think hes telling everyone why i didnt go
im too much of a fat ass walrus to go to the wedding
youre not a fat ass walrus
zoe eyes well up with tears again
why are you crying
you missed a stupid wedding
you got to have girls night with me
this is way more fun
i dont know
im just so emotional lately
its the hormones
you cant help it
being pregnant sucks
youre emotional and irrational and you get back fat
i have back fat
im just kidding
then okay yes
you have back fat
zoe feels her back
hows stan going to stay with me through this
well go shopping tomorrow
well get some hip maternity clothes
whatever that means
look at me bobby
pinching back fat look at me
what do you see
i see the most amazingly wonderful person i know
tears come to her eyes again
with back fat
stan leans against the bar with a beer in hand
he is watching all of the farmers market girls and his co worker fred on the dance floor
everyone looks drunk and happy
olivia stumbles towards him with an empty glass of champagne
why arent you dancing
im just about to go
come on one dance
the spaghetti strap of her dress falls over her shoulder
she steps in closer
for old times sake
i have a girlfriend olivia
never stopped you before
she tries to kiss him
stan steps away
its serious this time
olivia pulls back surprised
zoe is asleep in the bed
her bump looks very cute under the covers
stan quietly gets ready for bed
she turns to him half asleep
how was it
stan gets in bed next to her
zoe scoots into him
i miss my old ass
it was one of my best features
you know whats weird
i never knew your old ass
its kind of like this ass but way hotter
i also dont know what you really like to eat and whats just a craving or when you start laughing hysterically and then crying and you say this isnt me
if thats true because i dont really know the real you
all i know is the pregnant you
that is weird
or like how youre horny all the time
is that you
or is that pregnant you
lying thats me
when all of this is over who will you be
hopefully myself again
who is that
the clock by the bed says a
stan is snoring slightly
nuts is on the pillow beside him
zoes side is empty
zoe sits on the floor of the living room sifting through a box of photographs
we follow her back into the bedroom and onto the bed
as stan slowly opens his eyes she holds up a photograph
its a picture of a womans ass
this is my old ass
stan blinks a few times
his eyes adjusting
why do you have a picture of your ass
my college boyfriend took it
so i guess in fairness my ass doesnt look exactly like this anymore but its pretty close
its held up
its a nice ass
you said you dont know the real me so i thought id show you
she picks up another photograph
this one is of zoe at twelve and at her most awkward short hair braces and acne
this is me in seventh grade
stan props himself up in one elbow
you look like anthony michael hall
this period as horrible as it was made me who i am
i think every person should go through a hideously ugly phase
it builds character
then it also taught me that i should never under any circumstances have short hair and a perm again
she picks up another picture
its zoe in a bathing cap and speedo
shes holding up a yellow ribbon and has her arm around nana
this is one of my favorites because look how happy i am
i dont even know what place yellow is but im sure its not good
but i still look super happy right
thats all because of nana
whatever i did she thought it was the best
the next picture is a halloween shot of bobby mona and zoe
bobby is all in green zoe is all in yellow and mona is in regular clothes
these are my best friends bobby and mona
mona and i met in high school and bobby passed out on my couch in college and never left
you havent met them yet because they might scare you away
why are you dressed like that
we were supposed to be a traffic light but mona bagged out at the last minute and so bobby and i just look like idiots
thats typical mona by the way
zoe puts the picture down and picks up another
its a woman in a hospital bed
shes giving the thumbs up sign
this is my mom
stan takes the picture and studies it
you look just like her
this is the last picture of her that i have
she lived for a few more years but we never took any pictures because she didnt want us to remember her like that
i was eight when she died
she had a great laugh
and really soft hands
she used to rub my back before i went to sleep
zoe puts the picture on the bedside table propping it up next to her clock
do you have any pictures of your dad
zoe doesnt say anything
if you dont want to talk about it
my mother was in a coma for two years before the end
thats when my dad left her
thats when he died
to us anyway
im so sorry
after a beat its okay
it was an important lesson
thats when i realized that nothing lasts forever
this sad statement hangs in the air for a few moments
so thats my story
thats the real me
things can last forever you know
not for me they cant
stan takes her hand and they stay like that for a while
just holding hands on the floor of her moonlit room
finally the silence is broken by the telephone ringing
zoe and stan enter the lobby of an old building in tribeca
why did you say you would come witness this birth in the first place
i dont know
seemed like a good idea at the time
i was trying to get back in their good graces
ill meet you there
i dont want them to see you anyway
its four in the morning
im not letting you walk home alone
ill just pop in show my face and leave
ten minutes tops
there are candles everywhere and a table of food and drinks
kind of like a birthing cocktail party
zoe eats a brownie
carol approaches with lori who is wearing a caftan and rubbing her large stomach
they all hug
zoe its so nice of you to come especially at this crazy hour
youre really one of us now
are you sure youre in labor
youre so calm
oh im sure
well i just wanted to come and say a quick hi and good luck
youre not staying
you have to stay
lori wants us all to be together for this
well i really want to be here but
um the truth is
actually ive been wanting to tell you guys for a while but the truth is
lori drops her head on zoes shoulder and lets out a giant moan
its long and its awkward
whispering shes having a contraction
this is weird
lori breathes through it
what was it you were saying
im back with stan
actually he makes cheese
he named a cheese after me
isnt that romantic
off their blank stares well anyway im not technically a single mother by choice anymore
so if you want me to leave right now i totally understand
ill just walk out the door and no i really want you to stay
listen zoe if youre happy were happy
wed love to meet him
bring him to group any time
well actually hes downstairs so i should probably get back to great
invite him up
oh no no no
im not shy
ive been through this before
its quite beautiful really
zoe stands there trying to come up with another excuse
after a few moments its clear that she cannot
stan looks up from the hunan lotus take out menu hes been reading to pass the time
just a few minutes
i dont know zoe
you have to come up
they begged me
and truthfully im kind of scared of them
zoe and stan hover over the dessert table
they both eat brownies and keep their eyes down
sara is next to them nursing dakota
this is weird
good brownies though
this one has peanut butter in it
carol walks by with a little drum which she bangs rhythmically
come on everybody its time
shes getting into the water
oh its a water birth
didnt zoe tell you
carol starts banging the drum again and moves off
whats a water birth
i dont know
but just so were clear this
the whole scene is not the real me
ill wait here
zoe grabs another brownie and exits
in the middle of this very small very cramped living room is an inflatable baby pool
and in this baby pool is lori who is now naked and pushing
zoe watches horrified the brownie still in her hand
carol is beside her playing the drum and chanting
hi ya ya hi ya ya hi ya hi ya ya
eyes wide wow
its amazing how the body can open up like that
zoe covers her mouth
it looks like she is going to throw up
she stumbles for the door
im just going to get some air
im feeling a little
dont move zoe youre my focal point
lori then grunts through another big contraction
while loris eyes are closed zoe tries to sneak out
carol chases after still beating the drum
you cant leave
youre her focal point
cant she use someone else
shes in labor
you want to argue with her now
carol beats the drum faster now
some of the other single mothers by choicers join her in the chant
hi ya ya hi ya ya hi ya hi ya ya
lori lets out a scream as tabitha and the midwife pull her legs back
zoe watches with both hands over her mouth
then what is
its perfectly natural
sometimes the bowels just let go
then back to chanting hi ya ya hi ya ya hi ya hi ya ya
the midwife fishes out the poop with a plastic bag
zoe turns away gagging
she drops her brownie
yelling dont move zoe i need you
youre my focal point
what does that even mean
zoe turns back
her face white as a sheet
lori lets out another wail
i need to turn over
do it lori
were here for you
were all here for you
carol beats the drum faster as lori gets on all fours
the midwife lifts loris leg up to the side
lori lets out a loud whale like moan
excited here comes the head
loris moan turns into a donkey like bray
we can see the head lori
theres so much hair
woozy afraid i dont think thats the babys hair
i want to see the head
get me a mirror
its in the bedroom
ill get it
zoe makes a desperate attempt to run from the room
out in the foyer stan is paralyzed
next to him is dakota who is crying
through the hallway mirror he can see whats going on in the living room a hefty woman on all fours in a dirty inflatable swimming pool with a hairy head
coming out of a hairy vag
stan get the mirror
stan walks backwards with his head down holding a mirror
carol grabs the mirror and holds it under lori
lori lifts her leg like a dog taking a piss and then starts to cry
look at all that wet curly hair
stan steals a look starts to dry heave and rushes to zoe
freaking out lets get the hell out of here
im her focal point
what does that mean
i dont know
suddenly we hear a huge scream
zoe and stan turn just in time to see the baby emerge and plop into the water
cu of the baby in the dirty water still attached to the umbilical cord
cu of zoe and stans horrified faces
zoes eyes roll back and we over black we hear silence
until we hear the splash
we are close on zoes face
she opens her eyes
blinks a few times
are you okay
i dont know
why am i wet
widen to reveal that zoe is lying in the inflatable pool
her eyes go from side to side
the horror of the situation becoming clear
a spongy purple thing floats by
what is that
afraid i think its the placenta
zoes eyes roll back again and we
th street is just coming to life as the farmers start to unload their wares
zoe and stan head up the street slowly wearily like soldiers back from battle
we really shouldnt have seen that
i did mention that i barely know those people right
like forty times
i feel the need to say it again
they turn into the farmers market
angle on fred unloading cheese from the back of the little goat truck
stan and zoe slowly walk towards him
it wont be like that for us
how do you know
well for starters you wax
angle on olivia crossing from her berry stand to the cheese stand with a blueberry pie
she is about to place the pie on stans table when she looks up and sees stan and zoe
awkward beat then you remember zoe
and then olivia notices zoes pregnant belly
then to stan wow
at the same time zoe notices the post it on the pie
it says sorry about last night
what is that supposed to mean
olivia crumples the post it and turns to stan
zoes pregnant belly i had no idea it was that serious
i told you it was serious
interrupting what the hell does sorry about last night mean
i was drunk and
it was nothing
what was nothing
olivia turns back to stan flabbergasted
youre having a baby
i didnt know youd been together that long
well theyre not mine
but yeah were having a baby
on zoes look of shock we
the fruits and vegetables and flowers become a blur as zoe runs out of the farmers market
stan chases after her
get away from me
stan runs in front of her forcing her to stop
you said theyre not mine
i didnt mean to say it
how could you say that
i dont know
i was flustered
im sorry im not exactly thinking straight
ive been up all night watching orca give birth
incredulous theyre not mine
at a loss well i mean
technically theyre not
the minute he says this he wishes he could take it back
zoe just looks at him
she shakes her head
you know all this time youre trying to figure out who the real me is but who the fuck are you
she runs to a nearby cab and slams the door
zoe enters the apartment and slams the door behind her
she runs to the couch and collapses in tears
nuts wheels over and stands beside her
zoe and mona are at their usual table
zoe looks like she hasnt slept
do you really think something happened with the berry girl
they both said nothing happened
well are they going to come out and tell me
and thats not even the point
he said the babies werent his
and if he says that he thinks that
and if he thinks that hes not really committed
so now you run
why should i stick around for the end of the story when i know what its going to be
mona says nothing
she looks like she might say something and then doesnt
if you want to say something say it
do you know the end of the story
cant you just give him the benefit of the doubt
he seems like such a good guy
you havent even met him
yeah and dont think i dont know the reason for that
you were never going to see this through zoe
it was doomed before it began
just like all of your relationships
you get out before you get hurt
you dont think im hurt right now
every man is not your father
when are you going to realize that
you dont know what youre talking about
ive known you for thirty years
i know you dont trust people
you and your grandmother both
shes been engaged to arthur for how long now
leave nana out of this
shes never going to marry him
just like youd never marry stan
no wonder you ended up with a sperm donor
hell never let you down
its your ideal boyfriend
zoes face changes
she looks incredibly hurt
i used a donor because i wanted a baby
i went too far
because i wanted to have a family
because nana is the only one ive got and shes eighty four years old
and then it will just be me
so yeah you went a little too far
zoe leaves mona at the table
zoe and nuts lie on the pillow together
zoe scratches behind his ears
guess its just you and me again
nuts licks her face
she gets out of bed and goes to check her belly in the mirror
its actually getting kind of huge
zoe walks down the steps
stan is waiting for her on the sidewalk
his hands in his pockets
we have a doctors appointment
there is no we stan
come on i didnt mean to say it and thats not how i feel
zoe shakes her head
i made a mistake trusting you
dont say that
thats not true
youre not good for me
you made me think i needed you and i dont
so thats it
because of one stupid asinine thing that i said its all over
this is how it ends
this is how it ends
then i dont know why youre so surprised
i told you nothing lasts forever
zoe gives him a matter of fact shrug and walks off
harris moves the ultrasound wand over zoes belly
zoe holds up her shirt and watches the monitor
things look great
so ill see you back in two weeks and well start checking to see if the babies are dropping
its hard to believe were in the home stretch
harris helps zoe sit up
nows the time i start discussing a birthing plan with my patients
do you want me to wait until next time when stans here
he wont be here
hes out of town or something
im sorry to hear that
its back to just you and me now
weve come full circle
well dont you want anyone with you in the delivery room
you know like a birthing partner
zoe and nana are speed walking
nana stops excited
is that okay
cause youre all ive got
what do i have to do
i dont know
it will be a c section so basically just stand there and try not to faint
i can do that
it means a lot to me that youll be there
are you kidding me
ive been waiting my whole life for this
they pass arthur who is in his usual spot but instead of leering at nana hes in his chair with his head back and eyes closed
holy shit is he dead
how can you tell
hes been like that all morning
i wore him out last night
i did not need to know that
we were celebrating
with a smile we finally set a date
zoe stops dead in her tracks
nana walks zoe through the shadybrook dining room
so well put the band here and the dance floor right here
i cant believe youre getting married
what made you change your mind
all of a sudden it just hit me what am i waiting for
i love him
he loves me
what am i so afraid of
really big news
you dont seem happy
no i am
it just makes my situation seem all the more tragic
youre getting married and here i am
her voice trails off
im really happy for you
im worried about you honey
i just dont want you to make the same mistakes i made
ive been alone for over thirty years now and thats too long
sometimes in life you have to forgive and move on
are you talking about my father or stan
zoe has her box of photographs
she pulls out a picture from the very bottom
because if you dont learn how to forgive you will always be stuck in the past
the photo is zoe at age four and a man who looks so much like her that it can only be her father
after a long beat she puts it on her bedside table next to the one of her mother
the two pictures side by side make up a family
zoe and her father in one shot and her mother from the hospital bed giving the thumbs up sign in the other
over this image we hear a quartet playing wedding music
the music takes us into the church and there we find nana lovely in her wedding gown and arthur dashing in his morning suit standing at the alter holding hands
both have tears in their eyes
arthur lifts her veil and gives her the sweetest kiss
angle on zoe and bobby in the first pew passing a handkerchief back and forth
bobby leans against the piano singing a beautiful rendition of what a wonderful world
nana and arthur are alone on the dance floor
its their first dance as husband and wife
singing i see trees of green red roses too
i see them bloom for me and you
zoe watches her hands on her belly
mona stands beside her
this song always makes me cry
is it happy or sad
the words are happy but the song is so sad
i guess its both
happy and sad
singing i see skies of blue and clouds of white
the bright blessed day the dark and sacred night
im sorry about the things i said
it was really shitty of me
especially because you were right
mona takes zoes hand
singing and i think to myself
what a wonderful world
i dont want to be alone forever mona
then dont be
stan stares off into space
his beard is back
a customer surveys the different cheeses on the table
is this new
this is the first week its been out
can i have a sample
whats it like
very stubborn overly suspicious and distrustful of men
the customer looks up at stan
bobby pulls zoe onto the dance floor
come on you old maid
dance with me
but it doesnt mean that i wont dance with you
bobby starts dancing
but really dancing
justin timberlake style
zoe smiles at the absurdity and then tries to walk away
but bobby wont let her escape
he blocks her path and keeps dancing
this time turning around and shaking his ass triple time like beyonce
go away you freak
a crowd of old people gather round
they start clapping thinking this is some kind of young persons dance routine
smack it bitch
bobby takes zoes hand and smacks his ass with it
you know you love it
the old people do the same
trying to learn the hip new dance the kids are doing
several octogenarian couples smacking each others asses
while this is happening a weird look crosses zoes face
bobby jumps up and turns around to face zoe
but when he lands on the ground his feet slide out from under him and he hits the floor
what the hell
an old man in the crowd looks down at the puddle
then checks pants nope
a few other old people look down and check themselves
at which point zoe looks down and realizes
i think my water just broke
the whole retirement community is outside throwing rice as zoe bobby mona nana and arthur try to figure out the logistics of the trip to the hospital
youre in labor
you cant drive
you dont have a car or a license
then to bobby you drive
were in queens
i dont even know what side of the road they drive on here
will someone please just drive me to the fucking hospital
all of a sudden a white rolls royce pulls up
monas at the wheel
she leans out and waves
this was my surprise for after the wedding but lets hit it
they all pile in
and then the car pulls off revealing a sign that says just married
ensure cans tied to strings bump along behind them
things are a bit frantic in the car
are you okay
remember to breathe
breathe in breathe out breathe in
mona looks at zoe in the rearview and does lamaze breaths
hee hee hoo hoo hee hee
joining in hoo hoo
its getting really breathy in here
what about me
i have amniotic fluid on my gucci tux
angle on the mini bar which is fully stocked
who needs a drink
everyone including zoe raises their hands
zoe is being wheeled into labor and delivery with the gang in tow
bobby still has a glass of champagne in his hand
nana grabs the glass and swigs it
i dont know if i can do this
i cant go in with her
well i certainly cant do it
i dont do vaginas
they look at arthur who struggles to keep up with his walker
dont look at me
nana starts to hyperventilate
help me bobby
nana pull yourself together
this is the biggest moment of zoes life and you cant let her down
id slap you right now but im afraid your teeth would fly out
zoe is now alone in a room wearing a hospital gown
hee hee hoo hoo hee hee hoo hee
bobby enters all sweetness and light
how ya doing
smiles then so i really dont want you to worry but nana just passed out at the nurses station and is now down in the er getting stitches
everythings under control
good thing were at the hospital right
zoe jumps out of bed
where is she
get back in bed
all is well
arthurs with her
now on to bigger and better
who do you want to be your birthing partner
your choices are me or mona
zoe starts to cry
theyre shitty choices
do you want me to call your scary lesbian friends from your group
i dont know
were going to get through this okay
you just have to really think about it
who do you want with you in the delivery room
zoe wipes her tears
who is the one person you want by your side
zoe runs down the street with a blanket over her hospital gown
zoe jumps in
the cabbie looks at her in the rearview mirror
youre not an escaped mental patient are you
zoe runs across th street
the blanket flaps behind her like a cape
she looks like a hugely pregnant super hero
and suddenly she has to slow down and then stop completely for a contraction
she leans against a parked van to steady herself
son of a bitch that hurts
are you okay
out of the corner of her eye zoe sees an enormous strawberry on the side of the van
and then next to it she sees olivia
are you in labor
as soon as the contraction ends
zoe takes off again
olivia watches her go
zoe runs through the market looking for stan
angle on stans truck where stan and fred are unloading cheese
fred turns around and sees zoe running
all belly and boobs bouncing towards him
her gown starting falling off
ive had nightmares that started like this
are you okay
i cant help it
she keeps running towards him
he now runs towards her
they finally meet
zoe is out of breath and can barely talk
are you all right
why are you in a hospital gown
im in labor
what the hell are you doing here
nanas my birthing partner but she passed out and needed stitches and bobby asked me who i most wanted with me and
its only you
then i dont want to be alone anymore
i love you
you dont know how much i love you
stan doesnt know what to say
hes literally speechless
more than anything in the world i love you
ive been in love with you since the moment you stole my cab
zoe bends over holding her stomach
hee hee hoo hoo it was my cab hee hee hoo hoo
the contraction ends
zoe can finally smile again
stan laughs and throws his arms around her
oh im sorry
i just love you
i love you so much
then lets get the hell out of here
i think i really need to go to the hospital now
they kiss again
and then pull apart and look at each other
stan has tears in his eyes
lets go have our babies
people clap and cheer as they hurry out of the farmers market
even olivia watching from a distance cant help but applaud the big moment
some fantastic song that makes us want to cry is playing
we are close on zoes face
she is smiling
she does not look scared
and she does not look alone
widen to reveal stan by her side
and we pull back and above the operating table and see dr
harris performing the c section
he pulls out the babies one by one
we follow the babies as they get swaddled tight and handed back to zoe and stan
zoe and stan look at the little girls and then at each other
they are both in tears
harris cant help but cry
zoe is asleep
she opens her eyes and takes a moment to figure out where she is
she turns to the side and finds stan sleeping next to her curled up against her in the tiny hospital bed
to the side of the bed are two bassinets
each baby sleeping soundly in a little pink hat
and in the next bed is nana asleep with a bandage on her forehead
nuts trots rolls down the sidewalk wearing a sweater that says im a big brother
we tilt up and see zoe and stan strolling arm in arm each with a baby bjorn with a rosy cheeked baby girl in it
both girls have flaming red hair
a woman pushing a stroller passes by
she smiles at zoe and stan
they smile back
they are now at the counter with hot dogs in front of them
who knew you were such a romantic
well its the anniversary of our first date
where else would i take you
they clink dogs and each take a bite
what a year huh
wouldnt change a thing
well except for the part where you dumped me
and the part where you dumped me
to the babies girls
mommy and daddy were stupid
the babies smile and coo
baby talk yes we were
yes we were
the first time we held hands was in here
it started out as a high five but then i strategically turned into a hand hold
how do you remember that
we both agreed that we were totally sick of weddings and hated when people wrote their own vows
i remember that
i hope you wont hold it against me
nana and arthur come through the door smiling
zoe looks at them confused
what are you doing here
and then bobby comes through the door
and then mona
and joan and edward
and carol lori and sara with dakota planted on her breast
and a priest
zoe and stan still wearing the baby bjorns stand face to face in front of the guests and the priest
i promise to love you even though you still eat chicken mcnuggets in bed
i promise to name cheeses after all of our children no matter how embarrassed they are by it
i promise to always check out your ass when you walk away and i promise to love you more tomorrow than i do today which doesnt even seem impossible
and slowly the sound of stans voice fades out and the sound of louis armstrongs voice fades in
and we watch zoes face as she realizes that there are some things that really will last forever
