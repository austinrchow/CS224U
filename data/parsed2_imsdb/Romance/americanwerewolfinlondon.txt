an american werewolf in london by john landis on the moon
camera begins to pull back slowly straight up the song moon shadow by cat stevens begins
once we are high enough to see the entire moon the main title is superimposed
an american werewolf in london we continue to retreat from the moon looking on as it grows farther from us continuing credits until the full moon is the size it
appears to us from earth
tree branches enter into the frame the camera pans down and we see a truck approaching
we are at a crossroads in the moors looking sinister enough to have earned their literary reputation
the truck stops at the crossroads the driver mustached and wearing tweeds boots and a muffler climbs down
moon shadow ends
loud bang of the back grating on the truck as it slams down
revealed among the sheep are two rudely awakened young american boys
they look exhausted
they both carry backpacks two american kids on a jaunt in europe
they are both in their late twenties
it is very cold and they clamber out of the truck none too happily
pushing sheep aside they step out and stretch
theyve been cramped for hours
here lads east proctor and all about are the moors
i go east here
yes well thank you very much for the ride sir
you have lovely sheep
as he clambers back up on his truck boys keep off the moors
stay on the road
good luck to you
he drives off
long shot of the two boys as the lorry pulls away
surrounding them are the moors
they put on their packs david points to the signpost pointing towards east proctor
as they walk their breath visible are you cold
they walk on finally jack
youre not having a good time are you
oh i dont know
i mean look around
isnt this a fun place
the camera shows us the moors desolate cold foreboding
well i like it here
northern england first italy later
they walk on
do you think shell meet me in rome
i think debbie klein is a mediocre person with a good body
debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time
shes a jerk
youre talking about the woman i love
im talking about a girl you want to fuck so give me a break
well anyway do you think shell be there
i dont know
like an announcer rendezvous in rome starring jack goodman and debbie klein
the love affair that shocked europe
see torrid lovemaking at its most explicit
see jack and debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the vatican
never has the screen dared
if you dont stop im going to kill you
i have to make love to her
its very simple
she has no choice really
it just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull
it is impossible for a body like that to be dull
weve known debbie what since the eighth grade
how many years of foreplay is that
she says she likes me too much
david just laughs and laughs and laughs
david and jack entering east proctor
it is brightly moonlit
east proctor consists of a few shops all closed a petrol pump and a pub
east proctor has a very small population and the place looks empty
david and jack enter the middle of town and look about
the camera sees what they see
a few shops dark and shuttered
light and laughter come from the pub
its traditional shingle shows a ferocious wolfs bloody head on a pike and tells us the pubs name the slaughtered lamb
the slaughtered lamb
of course the slaughtered lamb
why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol
thats a wolfs head
of course the slaughtered lamb
why else would they have a severed wolfs head on a spear as their symbol
thats not a spear
its a pike
a severed wolfs head on a pike as their symbol
david before we go in there i want you to know that no matter what happens to us its your fault
i assume full responsibility
the pub was apparently modernized sometime in the mid fifties
its traditional englishness combines with greasy stainless steel and glass
it is populated by mostly pale young men with longish hair
several older men are ruddy complexioned and sport large mustaches
four or five are watching a chess game
two men are playing darts
the conversation is loud and there is often laughter
but there is something unsavory about these people
a look of leanness and poverty
they seem inbred and somehow sullen
we establish the types and the general level of noise in the room
the door opens revealing david and jack
there is dead silence and all are staring in a not friendly way at the two boys who are made uncomfortable by all the strange attention
they give each other a what
look then turn to the assembled populace
nice to see you
silent and staring
smiles its very cold outside
may we come in
the woman barkeep nods
the boys walk carefully over to a table and very self consciously remove their packs place them on the floor and sit down at the table
there is a long awkward wait
the woman finally comes over to them
do you have any hot soup
well do you have any coffee
weve got spirits and beer
if its something hot you want you can have tea
then you have some hot tea
but i can heat some up for you if youd like
as the woman turns to prepare the tea everyone resumes what they were doing talking drinking playing chess and darts and the boys breathe easier
nice looking group
listen at least its warm in here
look at that
on the wall is painted a red pentangle a five pointed star and on either side burns a yellow candle
what about it
its a five pointed star
maybe the owners are from texas
the woman brings them their tea
to woman remember the alamo
i beg your pardon
he was joking
i remember the alamo
i saw it once in london in leicester square
jack and david look startled
one of the chess players explains she means in the cinema that film with john wayne
turns to board checkmate
oh yes of course
right with laurence harvey and everybody died in it
it was very bloody
bloody awful if you ask me
this sends everyone into gales of laughter
jack and david smile politely
here gladys tom
did you hear the one about the crashing plane
no but were about to
you be quiet woman and let me speak
heavy sarcasm quiet everyone
all right laugh then
i shant tell it
oh come on tell us
youve had your chance
the men all coax him to tell the joke
to david ask them what the candles are for
to jack you ask them
to david listen thats a pentangle a five pointed star
its used in witchcraft
lon chaney jr
and universal studios maintain its the mark of the wolf man
to jack i see
you want me to ask these people if theyre burning candles to ward off monsters
to david right
to jack wrong
the drinkers have gotten the chess player to tell the joke as everyone knew he would
oh all right
there was this airplane over the atlantic on its way to new york
it was full of men from the united nations
thats very funny that is
to david go on ask them
to jack you ask them
here now let me finish
so halfway over the ocean the engines run low on petrol so they have to lighten the plane
so they heave out all the baggage but its still too heavy
so they chuck out the seats but its still too heavy
finally this froggy steps up and shouts viva la france and leaps out
then an englishman
undaunted steps up and shouts god save the queen
and leaps out
but the plane is still too heavy
so the yank delegate from texas steps up shouts remember the alamo
and chucks out the mexican
this is apparently the funniest joke the inhabitants of east proctor have ever heard
the laughter is uproarious choking knee slapping incredible
as the chess player goes to take a drink of beer the dart player gasps out
remember the alamo
causing the chess player to spit out his beer causing even harder laughter
excuse me but whats that star on the wall for
a dart lands in the wall
david and jack are understandably bewildered
the villagers look hard indeed
angry youve made me miss
ive never missed the board before
jack wed better go
what do you mean
theres no food here
the villagers look threatening and davids voice is a bit urgent
come on jack shall we go
the boys pick up their backpacks and move uncertainly for the door
to men you cant let them go
worried how much do we owe you
go god be with you
uh thank you
you just cant let them go
and stay on the road
keep clear of the moors
yes well thanks again
beware the moon lads
david pushes jack out
it is very cold
what the hell was that all about
i dont know
lets see if theres an inn or something up the road
beware the moon
come on im freezing
they start up the road into the night
it is quiet
you cant let them go
angry should the world know our business
its murder then
then murder it is
its in gods hands now
the wax drips from the pentangles candles onto the floor
walking on the road surrounded by darkness
that was weird
i guess leaving was the best idea
i dont know
now that were out here and its three degrees im not so sure i wouldnt rather face a blood thirsty mob
well not quite a blood thirsty mob
they keep walking
what do you think was wrong
i have no idea
maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural
i see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it because they felt so silly
there is a flash of lightning that sends a ghostly illuminating sheet of light over the boys faces
the clap of thunder follows loud and rumbling
please dont rain
the boys are walking in a deluge
they walk getting soaked
im well aware of how pleasant the weather is in rome at the present time thank you
jack spreads his arms and sings
the rain is loud on the roof and beating on the windows
the gathered continue to drink play chess and darts but all are silent and contemplative
perhaps theyll be safe in the rain
the chess player slams his hand on the table
shouts no one brought them here
no one wanted them here
you could have told them
are you daft
what do you think theyd say
theyd think us mad
the rain is subsiding
there is a very faint howl
did you hear it
we must go to them
i heard nothing
the camera lingers as the chess players hard face shows the mans struggle
the chess player turns suddenly
david and jack are now completely out of sight from east proctor surrounded by darkness and wet
there is a light drizzle
they are standing listening
the drizzle stops
did you hear that
i heard that
what was it
david begins to walk jack with him
could be a lot of things
there arent any coyotes in england
the hound of the baskervilles
heathcliffe didnt howl
no but he was on the moors
its a full moon beware the moon
another howl this one long and loud
it is a very inhuman noise terrifying and closer this time
i vote we go back to the slaughtered lamb
they are both visibly worried and walk briskly back from where they just came
although after a bit of fast walking they are getting nowhere
they stop out of breath
another bloodcurdling howl
david what is that
i dont know
come on where
i think we should just keep moving
a low guttural growl comes from out of the darkness
we stay on the boys but we hear something out there
it starts to walk
its circling us
and indeed it is
the boys strain to hear its four footfalls and they turn slowly following it
we hear the wolf monster stop for thats what it is we know its there even though weve not seen it
it sits breathing heavily
whats the plan
not too relaxed himself lets just keep walking
they do and david keeps talking as they walk
thats right a lovely stroll in the moors
tra la la isnt this fun
the thing stalking them seems to speed up
the boys hesitate as they sense it run past them
its in front of us
do you think its a dog
jack and david strain to see what waits ahead of them
something is waiting in the darkness
its hulking shape is barely discernible but its eyes glow eerily and its breath is visible
what is that
a sheep dog or something
turn slowly and lets walk away
the boys keep talking as they move faster and faster
walk away jack
walking away yes sir
here we are walking away
they are in a full out run by now
after a few minutes flight they stop panting
a moment of quiet then a howl
it sounds far away
not far enough
they walk briskly
where are we going
ill tell you when we get there
im glad we
david shouts as he slips suddenly in the mud scaring jack and us and himself a great deal
he lays startled on the wet ground for a moment then he and jack laugh
you really scared me you shithead
are you going to help me up
jack takes davids extended hand to help him up when the lunging beast brings jack down in one fell swoop
david falls back on his ass
jack is screaming and struggling as he is torn to shreds
david scrambles to his feet and runs in complete panic
jacks screams and the wolfs roars combine
please help me
david runs and runs
finally he falls out of breath
oh my god jack
he gets up and runs back to find jack a torn and bloody mess on the ground
he stares in horror
the wolf springs
the camera adopts davids p
as he fights the dark savage shape on top of him
fangs clamp down on his shoulder when shots ring out and the hulking form rolls off of him
david dazed and bloody looks and sees the men from the slaughtered lamb armed with shotguns and torches running towards him
looking over at his attacker instead of a wolf he sees a very old naked man laying in the mud riddled with bullet holes
as the villagers crowd around david falls back and faints
david is in a small clean and very white hospital room
he lays on his back in bed his shoulder bandaged and his arm plugged into a bottle of plasma
there are several cuts and abrasions on his arms and face but he really doesnt look too bad
he opens his eyes slowly blinks and tries to sit up and look around but is unable to because of the pain
he calls out
and passes out
however his shout has fetched a nurse
she is alex price very english very beautiful
she goes to the bed
she looks into his eyes lifting the lids with her thumb and then checks his chart at the end of the bed
david remains unconscious
another young nurse miss gallagher comes in
he all right
yes i should think
he called out just now
hes an american you know
hirsch is going to fetch round one of those embassy fellows to see him
chart says hes from new york
i think hes a jew
why on earth do you say that
smiles really susan i dont think that was very proper and besides its common practice now
a voice startles the girls
yes miss gallagher miss price is quite right
he is an older man wearing the customary lab coat
a very commanding and reassuring presence
the girls are embarrassed
kessler cried out a minute ago
miss gallagher surely you must perform some function here at the hospital
then get on with it
hirsch begins to examine david
hirsch turns to alex
can i be of service miss price
go about your duties
she starts to exit
oh miss price
what exactly did he call out
he said jack
that would be jack goodman the boy who was killed
what happened to them
the police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them
he must have been a very powerful man
although i really dont see that it is any of your concern miss price
of course sir
good day doctor
she exits as dr
hirsch continues his examination looking into davids eyes
the camera is handheld running furiously through the almost dense greenery
on the soundtrack are the footfalls and heavy breathing of the runner
the camera abruptly stops and turns sharply looking about the panting continuing
the breathing gets louder and harder then too loud when we david opens his eyes quickly the silence and whiteness contrast sharply with the preceding fantasy
standing beside the bed are dr
hirsch and mr
collins wears a bow tie and is holding a briefcase
i am dr
hirsch and this is a countryman of yours mr
where am i
youre in a hospital in london
i had a strange dream
i should think so after your recent traumatic experiences
the guy i was with
is he all right
how did i get to london
quietly now david i want you to prepare yourself your friend is dead
david jolts up in bed and shouts
the sudden exertion and strain hurt
he sinks back down
kessler i am mr
collins of the american embassy here in grosvenor square
goodmans parents and your parents have been notified of your injuries and everythings in order
everythings in order
what are you talking about
goodmans body has been air freighted back to new york for burial and your parents have wired funds for your stay in the hospital until you are well enough to
controlled tears you dont crate and ship jack like some side of beef
approaching hysteria who the hell are you people
whats going on here
where is jack
i demand to see him
holds david down calls out miss price
miss price please
shouting get your fucking hands off me
what the hell is going on here
alex enters amidst davids shouting and confusion
distraught clutching his briefcase i realize how upsetting this must be for you mr
kessler but please try to refrain from hysterics
david continues shouting and struggling
prepare a hypodermic please miss price
the shot is administered and david is held down by dr
hirsch and alex until his breathing becomes more normal
kessler try not to excite yourself
everything has been arranged
i shall come back to check on your progress and send a report to your parents
the police have requested to interview you and i have given them permission to do so
hirsch walks mr
collins to the door
thank you very much mr
hell rest now and im sure everything will be fine once hes adjusted
hes had quite a shock
these dumb ass kids never appreciate anything you do for them
hirsch crosses back to the bed
how long have i been here
youve been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago
youve suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises lost a bit of blood but nothing too serious black and blue for a while
youll have some dueling scars to boast of
that lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow
they say a mad man has the strength of ten
softly as the drugs take hold lunatic
now weve just given you a pretty strong sedative so try to get some rest now
miss price will see to your needs
hirsch watches as alex straightens davids covers
softly it wasnt a lunatic
puzzled i beg your pardon
it was a wolf
bends down close to hear what
david passes out
alex looks to dr
did he say a wolf
yes i believe he did
hirsch regards david thoughtfully
hirsch is on the phone he is referring to a desk calendar
but roger is so terribly boring
yes dear but couldnt we
he makes a note thursday at eight dinner with boring roger
yes im sure i will if i survived rommel i suppose ill survive another excruciating evening with roger mathison
be a good girl
he hangs up very disgruntled
the intercom buzzes
villiers and sgt
mcmanus are here to see you doctor
send them in
he rises to greet the two police officers one tall the other rather pudgy
come in come in
the cops sit down lt
villiers immediately produces a small notebook
no thank you
mcmanus id like some tea please
villiers shoots the sergeant a withering look
mcmanus maybe not
its no problem
no thank you doctor
well then what can i do for scotland yard
mcmanus we understand the kessler boy has regained consciousness
villiers glares at mcmanus
kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors
the intercom buzzes
roger mathison doctor
hes on the telephone
tell him im out
no tell him ive passed away
an old war wound or something
tell him im dead
and no more calls
he turns from the intercom back to the cops
you were saying
has david kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors
why dont we ask him
david sits up in bed
villiers and sgt
mcmanus stand by his side
hirsch sits observing
im sorry if i conflict with your report but jack and i were not attacked by a man
so youve said
mcmanus he may have a point lieutenant
two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man
mcmanus are you suggesting that david and jack were in fact attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of east proctor has conspired to keep it a secret
we have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police
we have two witnesses to the crime
youll forgive me mr
kessler if i consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock
mcmanus lieutenant the boy seems pretty lucid to me and
and what sergeant
mcmanus defeated i dont rightly know sir
that is precisely my point
david as far as we are concerned the matter is closed
we wont trouble you any further
the lieutenant goes for the door
the sergeant smiles at david and follows
the cops exit
hirsch crosses to davids bed
there were witnesses
so they said
how could there have been witnesses
it was so dark
we were running and i fell and jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere
i dont understand what theyre talking about
in time im sure it will all come back to you
doctor my memory is fine
its my sanity im beginning to worry about
again the handheld camera is running furiously through the woods
heavy breathing and the sounds of the runner crashing through the foliage
the camera runs for a while then suddenly stops short near a tree
david abruptly enters frame animal like the tenseness of a startled cat
his head makes sudden movements looking about
of his flared nostrils and perked up ears accenting his animalness
takes off and now we run with him
he runs fast and gracefully taking long strides and leaps
we run with him faster and faster sharing in his exhilaration
we see him completely as the animal study his movement and grace as if watching a gazelle
suddenly he stops again alert listening
he moves with stealth slowly he pushes some leaves aside
of his eyes
several deer in the forest they sense something and freeze the camera noting a fawn next to a doe
the buck turns his head feeling the danger
shots showing the muscles in his legs and shoulders tensing
of davids eyes
of the frightened deer
of davids eyes
as it is leapt upon its terrified face leaving frame as david forces it down
davids head reenters frame his mouth full of flesh his face and hands covered with blood
he howls in triumph
the lights are subdued and davids asleep
the door opens a shaft of light penetrates the room
miss gallagher enters with a small tray
she crosses to david turns on the bed light and touches him
wake up please
awakened i was having a nightmare
miss gallagher is very efficient in administering the pills and pouring a glass of water
yes well these should help that
thats right drink up
david takes the pills
now go back to sleep so youll be fresh for dr
hirsch in the morning
what time is it
its nearly eight
im off duty shortly then im off to the films with alex
miss price the other nurse that attended you
what are you going to see
an american film about the mafia called see you next wednesday and i want to see it badly so you give me no problems and go to sleep
dropping off do you have bad dreams too
some everyone does
yes but does everyone kill bambi
david has fallen asleep
miss gallagher turns off the light picks up her tray and pauses in the doorway
she exits closing the door plunging the room into darkness
the corridor is busy with orderlies pushing gurneys about doctors visitors and patients all performing appropriate background actions
behind the nurses counter alex is typing some forms and an older obviously senior nurse is filling some paper cups with different sizes and colors of pills she is taking
from the drug cabinet
she is mrs
hobbs the chief nurse
take these round now will you please
the american boy in twenty one is only to have these after hes eaten
will you be sure of that
has he been refusing food
nothing quite as dramatic as that miss price
he just doesnt eat enough of what is put before him
he suffers from nightmares
id think he just needs a hand to hold
alex takes the cups handed to her and makes her way down the hallway pausing a moment to straighten her appearance
a ward with seven or eight beds in it all occupied
she goes to a little pakistani boy named benjamin
well all right then be that way
here swallow this
alex pours a glass of water gives the pill to benjamin who promptly takes it and then drinks the water handing alex back the glass
the doctor will be round later
would you like a picture book to look at
we have some lovely funny beanos
she exits pausing in the hall to speak to a black jamaican orderly pushing a cart of lunch trays into benjamins ward
has the patient in twenty one gotten his tray yet
how did he look
what do you mean how did he look
you know did he seem depressed
do you think hell eat the food
annoyed im an orderly not a bleeding psychiatrist
i push things about but ive little say what happens to them
alex holds up her head and proceeds to davids room
she hesitates then peeks in
the curtains are drawn and davids lunch waits patiently on its tray alongside of the bed
david is apparently asleep
alex enters softly
you havent eaten your lunch
im not very hungry thank you
im afraid you have to eat something
im not hungry
you put me in an awkward position mr
how is that
she shakes the paper cup well youre to take these after youve eaten
now what kind of nurse would i be if i failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills
leave the pills
ill take them later
she opens the curtains daylight fills the room
aw come on miss price
call me alex
aw come on alex
shall i be forced to feed you mr
david is getting interested
call me david
shall i be forced to feed you david
this is absurd
im not hungry
i dont want any food
alex efficiently removes the covers from the dishes and sits on the edge of the bed
taking knife and fork in hand she neatly cuts davids food into pieces
david watches all this amused
she places a napkin under davids chin and holds up his first bite on his fork
david folds his arms and refuses to open his mouth
lets try a little harder shall we
will you give me a break
alex grabs davids nose forcing his mouth open quickly shoving the fork in it
david is startled but amused and chews his food slowly and swallows it
alex holds up another bite
will i have to take such drastic action again david
david opens his mouth obediently
alex almost smiles
she feeds him for a while they are both sizing each other up
finally may i have a glass of milk
again we are running fast and faster
david again running naked flying through the green forest
he stops suddenly ears perked he looks about and then we hear jacks o
the voice of jack screams david
please help me
oh my god
david turns in blind panic he runs and we run with him desperately trying to find the source of jacks screams
he comes to a clearing in the woods light streaming through the tall trees
jacks screams halt in mid word
david looks in disbelief at the clearing
there is a hospital bed with someone in it
it is the same as davids
david walks toward it slowly
the figure in the bed lays still
it grows dark very dark and david looks up at the full moon
there is a howl identical to the one heard earlier back on the moors
david approaches the bed slowly fearfully
we hear ocean noises on the soundtrack the sound of crashing surf
david reaches out to pull back the covers lightning and thunder cause him to hesitate for a second
the camera remains on david as he pulls off the covers
his face registers total disbelief and increasing horror
we cut to the bed to find david
he lies there pale white with purple lips and death pallor
the camera begins to move in on the corpse of david
cut back to the standing davids terrified face then continue until davids death mask fills the screen
the face remains still for several beats then suddenly opens its bright yellow eyes and red mouth revealing fangs in a bloodcurdling wail which carries over in the
hobbs hears davids screams and efficiently calls out
miss gallagher and an orderly appear at once
orderly go at once to twenty one and restrain the patient
the orderly exits
miss gallagher remain here at the desk
ill be in twenty one
it is bright daylight and dr
hirsch gazes thoughtfully out the window
youve never had bad dreams before
upset sure as a kid
but never so real
never so bizarre
hirsch crosses over and sits on a chair by the bed
did you get a good look at the man who attacked you
ive told you it wasnt a man
it was an animal
a big wolf or something
a rabid dog
chewing on his glasses yes
hirsch i know ive been traumatized but jack was torn apart
i saw him
a man cant do that to someone with his bare hands
youd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of
did you see jack
in fact your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here
did you talk to the police in east proctor
did the cops go to the slaughtered lamb
i really dont know
then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me
you yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that
rubs his forehead david please
the police are satisfied
im certain that if a monster were out roaming northern england wed have seen it on the telly
you really think im crazy dont you
the hound of the baskervilles was an invention of sir arthur conan doyles
and if youd read the bloody book youd find that holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud a fake
there is an awkward silence as david sits and dr
hirsch is embarrassed at raising his voice
now really david
youre far too intelligent to go on this way
when you return to america i want you to seek out a competent psychiatrist or psychologist or something and stop this nonsense
youll be leaving this hospital in three or four days please remain sane
at least until you are no longer our responsibility
hirsch goes to the door
pause id rather not be by myself
of course not david
ill fetch in young miss price
alex sits next to davids bed
her shoes are off and she has her feet tucked up under her legs on the chair
the room is dark except for the lamp by which she reads
she is reading a connecticut yankee in king arthurs court by mark twain
david is asleep
alex reads for a bit then puts down the book and yawns
she gets up and stretches a big spreading arms and feet fingers and toes stretch
quietly youre a very beautiful girl
embarrassed i thought you were asleep
what are you reading
a connecticut yankee in king arthurs court by mark twain
do you like it
ive just started it
my friend gave it to me
they look at each other
what do you dream about
i dream of death mostly
i shouldnt have asked you
i want to talk to you
they sit and look at each other for a while longer
how old are you
thats not really a very proper question
how old are you
im twenty seven
now what do you want to talk about
was jack goodman your good friend
seriously my best friend
my very best friend
embarrassed shall i read to you
oh yes please
opens book a connecticut yankee in king arthurs court by samuel l
this is after the preface but before chapter one a word of explanation
you all right
settles back yes go on
clears her throat ahem a word of explanation
it was in warwick castle that i came across the curious stranger whom i am going to talk about
he attracted me by three things his candid simplicity his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor and the restfulness of his company for he did all the talking
we fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd
we are at davids parents house in new york
his father sits reading the paper in the living room as his younger brother and sister watch the muppet show on television
we can see past the small dining nook where david sits doing homework and into the kitchen where his mother is washing the dishes
a peaceful lower middle class setting
all is tranquil and secure
there is a loud pounding on the front door
ill get it
the pounding continues
all right all right
hold your horses
the following happens with shocking speed
when he opens the door four beings open fire with machine guns blowing him away
the sudden burst of violence is terrifying and unrelenting
the four rush into the room and the family looks at them in fearsome surprise for these men are not human at all but loathsome bestial demons dressed as storm
one kicks in the television and fires into the kitchen blasting davids mother
david rises but is forced back into his chair by one of the things and held there
he watches in horror as his little brother and sister scream in terror before they are brutally murdered
the monstrous storm troopers then set fire to the rooms
the one holding david pulls a knife and quickly slits davids throat
david bolts upright in bed and looks around trying desperately to gain his bearings
he sees that alex is asleep in the chair by his bed connecticut yankee folded on her lap
he makes a deliberate effort to calm himself
he considers waking her then decides against it
he turns on the lamp by his bed and reaches over to take the book from alexs lap
david takes the book as gently as possible but alex wakes up anyway
yawns smiles hello
you all right
im sorry i woke you up
dont be silly
can i get you something
no thank you
just keep me company for a while
thats easy enough
i keep having these really terrible dreams
they are getting worse and i cant seem to stop them
david your dreams will stop
youll leave england and your bad memories and then this will all fade away
will you come with me
taken aback what
smiling im serious
you dont know me and i know nothing about you
we have a perfect relationship
now david i said i would keep you company but i meant right here and now
will you think about it
how did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient
big grin not just a patient me
youre being awfully forward arent you
forgive me im trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it
smiles all i am to you is a sex fantasy then
now im embarrassed
i thought for a moment i was the only embarrassed one in the room
there is an awkward pause
where were we in the book
alex is relieved for something to break the tension
looking through the book let me see here
the black orderly hustles in with davids breakfast tray busily setting up the tray on the table over the bed
he awakens the sleeping david with his activity
ah youre up
good morning and a good day to you
weve quite a meal for you here this morning
bacon oatmeal orange juice and toast with jam
good stuff there
now eat it up and ill be back for the dishes when youve finished
the orderly exits
the drowsy david who has been trying to fully wake up during the orderlys speech notices his exit
he looks at his food none too happily
he sticks a spoon into the bowl of oatmeal and tastes is gingerly
in mock english accent please sir i want some more
he settles down to eating reaches over to butter his toast and drink his juice
while he eats we hear jacks o
can i have a piece of toast
david looks over to the o
jack behaving relaxed and normal sits in the chair last occupied by alex
however jacks appearance makes his casual manner all the more surreal
he is as we left him butchered on the moors
he is covered with dried mud and open wounds
huge glistening gashes abound on his body
his face is scratched his throat is badly torn and his hair is matted with blood
in several spots he has already begun to rot
he is a remarkably gruesome sight but his physical state seems not to affect him at all
pleasantly nice to see you
unbelieving get the fuck out of here jack
thanks a lot
horrified this is too much
i cant handle this
im aware that i dont look so great but i thought youd be glad to see me
jack gets up and takes a piece of toast from davids tray as david watches amazed
jack returns to his seat and takes a bite out of his toast
david stares at jack horrified
youre hurting my feelings
astounded hurting your feelings
has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me
listen to me im talking to a hamburger
im sorry to be upsetting you david but i had to come
aghast arent you supposed to be buried in new york someplace
your parents came to my funeral
i was surprised at how many people came
resigned why should you be surprised
you were a very well liked person
debbie klein cried a lot
i cant stand it
so you know what she does
shes so grief stricken she runs to find solace in rudy levines bed
rudy levine the shmuck
life mocks me even in death
jack takes another bite of toast
to himself im going completely crazy
david now i know this may be hard for you but i have to warn you
shouting warn me
will you get out of here you meat loaf
im a grisly sight its true but i love you and thats why im here
youve got to know
if you love me so much jack youll realize how disconcerting it is to share ones breakfast with the living dead
we were attacked by a werewolf
covers his ears im not listening
on the moors we were attacked by a lycanthrope a werewolf
shut up you zombie
i was murdered an unnatural death and now i walk the earth in limbo until the werewolfs curse is lifted
incredulous furious whats wrong with you
the wolfs bloodline must be severed
the last remaining werewolf must be destroyed
will you be quiet
jack rises and comes closer to david
its you david
you survived and now you shall continue the curse
what are you talking about
i wont accept this
remember what that guy at the slaughtered lamb said
beware the moon
quietly stop it jack
beware the moon
the full moon david
youve got two days
quietly jack please go away
please go away
youll stalk the streets of london a creature of the night
flares up youre talking like boris karloff
its movie dialogue
david please believe me
you will kill people david
youve got to stop the bloodshed before it begins
listen to me
take your own life david
its our only chance
the powers of darkness
its all true
take your own life
losing it nurse
its cold david and im so alone
the undead surround me
have you ever talked to a corpse
kill yourself david before you kill others
alex rushing down the hospital corridor
david rocking back and forth weeping
dont cry david
alex rushing down hospital corridor
please dont cry
alex rushing to the door
softly in looming closeup beware the moon david
as she bursts into the room
laying in bed rocking from side to side crying softly
he is alone
alex rushes over removes the tray sits on the bed and hugs david
david pulls away sharply his head jerking about wildly until he focuses on alexs face and begins to breathe easier
david whats wrong
david smiles and kisses her a real kiss
quietly im a werewolf
alex holds david a moment then realizes where she is and backs off a little
david composes himself
are you better now
ill let you know the next full moon
youre to be discharged tomorrow
will you be all right
david takes alexs hand
my friend jack was just here
your dead friend jack
he says that i will become a monster in two days
what do you think
what do i think
you mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends
i was dreaming again
i would think so
resigned yeah i would think so too
alex considers for a while finally
do you have a place to stay in london
david and alex walking down the street
alex points out her flat and leads david up the front steps
she gives him a conspiratorial look and unlocks the door
alex enters and david follows
a small utilitarian apartment she flicks on the kitchen light
david puts his backpack on the floor
she proceeds to give the tour
there is only one bed
makes a face david perhaps youd like to watch the telly while i take a shower
alex enters the room and david whistles softly rocking on his heels
david and alex stand facing each other under the stream of water in the shower
its nice to see you
its nice to see you
a sequence of soap and flesh
van morrisons moondance plays
a montage of soapy hands on slippery skin
thighs rubbing thighs arms and shoulders
david and alex kiss again and again and
david and alex in a passionate orgasmic kiss in alexs bed
david pulls out and they lay holding each other
after a moment
will you be here in about fifteen minutes
alex props herself up on one elbow
david you dont honestly believe that in reality your friend jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you
do you really
i was awake and he was in my room
firm i wasnt hallucinating
smiles tomorrow is the full moon
thats good alex
alex begins kissing davids neck
its all right i know im being insane
she kisses his shoulders then his chest
im properly reassured
alex is now kissing his stomach her head gradually lowers from frame
david reaches back over his head to hold onto the headboard of the bed
closing his eyes this is very reassuring
im feeling very reassured
alex is asleep holding david
david carefully lifts her arm and gets out of bed
he is naked
he tiptoes out of the room and goes to the bathroom
david lifts the toilet seat and pees
he winces hoping the steady stream doesnt awaken alex
when hes finished peeing he goes to the sink
the medicine cabinet door over the sink is open
when david closes it he and the audience is terrified to see jack reflected standing behind him
note this is a big scare
bloodied and horrible jack has continued to rot and looks even worse than when we last saw him
david chokes out a strangled cry closes his eyes tightly and then reopens them
jack is still there in the mirror
when david turns around jack is standing in the doorway
points a trembling finger youre not real
dont be an asshole david
david clearly troubled follows jack into the living room
jack sits down and motions for david to sit also
davids conversation is in whispers so as not to wake up alex
what are you doing here
i wanted to see you
okay youve seen me
now go away
david im sorry i upset you yesterday but you must understand what is going on
i understand all right
youre one of the undead and im a werewolf
get out of here jack
david tomorrow night is the full moon
youll change youll become
interrupting a monster
i know i know
you must take your own life now david before its too late
jack are you really dead
what do you think
i think ive lost my mind
i think youre not real
i think im asleep and youre a part of another bad dream
you must believe me
that tomorrow night beneath the full moon ill sprout hair and fangs and eat people
the canines will be real
youll taste real blood
god damit david please believe me
youll kill and make others like me
im not having a nice time david
dont allow this to happen again
you must take your own life
shouts i will not accept this
now go away
alex wakes up from the shouting
quietly this is not pretend david
righteous i will not be threatened by a walking meat loaf
alex enters the room
david whats wrong
i heard voices
david turns and sees that jack is gone
triumphant it was just me alex
it was just me
hirsch is driving down the main street in his red m
he parks in front of the slaughtered lamb
the pub is less crowded than when we were here last
the dart player is behind the bar cleaning glasses the chess player is still at the chessboard
hirsch enters and crosses to the bar
as he removes his gloves a drink for a very cold man
the woman comes in from the back
what can i get you
campari and soda would do nicely
i suppose guinness will suffice
she serves him his beer
as he lays down his money
a thousand thanks
after a few sips
nasty bit of business with those two young american boys
the dart player stops his wiping
im afraid i dont know what you mean sir
yes im sure thats right
a few weeks ago the last full moon wasnt it
the chess player turns in his chair to get a good look at dr
i mean that escaped lunatic
the one that killed the boy
wasnt that near here
concerned and where are you from sir
hirsch crosses and joins the chess player at his table
knight takes pawn
sees that dr
hirsch was talking about his game
oh yes yes
hirsch points to the pentangle on the wall
nervously oh thats been there for two hundred years
we were going to paint it out but its traditional so we left it
youve heard nothing about the incident
are you a police officer
smiles no no hardly
i work in the hospital where the kessler boy was brought
the dart player and chess player exchange a look
he was talking about werewolves and monsters and as i was near here i thought
you thought what
i thought id look into the boys story
scoffs a story about werewolves now really sir
hirsch eyes the chess player
would you like a game of chess
we find alex and david in an embrace by the front door
alex is dressed in her nurses uniform and david has jeans and a t shirt on
he is shoeless and obviously not going out
alex pulls away
let me go now youll make me late
do me an enormous favor
tell me that its silly of me to be apprehensive
its silly of you to be apprehensive
werewolves simply do not exist
serious david do you want me to stay here tonight
yeah i do but go to work
he opens the door and they both go outside
walk to the sidewalk
it is rather chilly
listen if you get too anxious call me at the hospital okay
ive left those pills for you
a doper werewolf
they kiss again
theres food in the fridge
see you later
alex goes off turning for a last wave
david stands looking after her when a little girl walking a dog passes by
the dog on seeing david begins to growl and snarl
to dog what did i do
the dog begins barking ferociously the little girl tugging on his leash
thanks a lot dog
he realizes just how cold he is outside and runs back up the steps to find the door locked
cut to shot of davids bare feet on the cold stone
he mutters to himself imitating a newscaster
an american werewolf was found frozen to death today in the heart of london england
he looks around and sees that there is a small window ajar on the side of the flat about eleven feet off the ground which can be reached by climbing
a brick wall which he does but not without damage to his bare toes
at the top of the wall is a cat that begins to hiss on seeing david
the hair stands up on its arched back and it glares at david hissing and spitting
david is disturbed by the cats hostile behavior
what did i do cat
the cat is really acting fierce
when david goes to pat it cautiously it screeches and runs away
david is by this time not amused
david manages to pull himself into the window
david awkwardly enters the bathroom through the tiny window
finally getting both feet on the ground he steps to the sink and regards himself in the mirror
he examines his mouth touching his canines carefully
after a while he sighs and goes into the kitchen
david goes straight to the fridge and opens it
he closes the fridge and walks into the bedroom
he lays down on the bed
after a few beats of staring at the ceiling he rises and goes back into the kitchen
he reopens the fridge
im not hungry
he closes the fridge and walks into the living room
david turns on the television
on thames is a soccer match
on bbc is some truly insipid childrens program and on bbc is a soccer match
david switches off the television
he sits on the chair nervously drumming his fingers and humming
singing moon river wider than a mile im crossing you in style someday
david gets up goes to the front door and flings it open
it is getting dark
david views this fearfully but still not completely convinced
he goes back inside and we note that the front door is not completely closed
he goes back into the bathroom and looks into the mirror
fee fi fo fum i smell the blood of an englishman
he goes back into the living room and paces round and round the room like a caged animal
alex is back with benjamin the little pakistani
how are we feeling tonight
smiling benjamin have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck
i thought not
she tucks him in
you sleep now and have sweet dreams
for the first time benjamin smiles
as alex tucks him in we can clearly see the full moon outside through the window
david sits reading connecticut yankee when he suddenly clutches his head in pain
he stands in agony the book falls to the floor
he begins sweating profusely clinging to the sides of his head
he trembles violently
im burning up
he rips at his shirt tearing it off
his body is dripping wet
shouts out in pain and fear jack
where are you now you fucker
as a new spasm of pain wracks his body he cries out in anguish
somebody help me please
davids hair is wringing wet
he screams and grabs at his legs
pleading whimpering im sorry i called you a meat loaf jack
new bolts of agonizing pain wrack through davids body
he grabs at his pants pulling them off as if they are burning him
standing naked in the center of the room david gasps for air
he falls to his knees and then forward on his hands
he remains on his hands and knees trying to master his torment but its no use
on all fours he gives himself over to the excruciating hurt and slowly begins to change
the metamorphosis from man into beast is not an easy one
as bone and muscle bend and reform themselves the body suffers lacerating pain
we can actually see davids flesh move the rearranging tissue
his mouth bleeds as fangs emerge
his whole face distorts as his jaw extends his skull literally changing shape before our eyes
his hands gnarl and his fingers curl back as claws burst forward
the camera pans up to show the full moon outside through the window
davids moans change slowly into low guttural growls
we hear the four footfalls as the wolf begins to walk
as the camera pans back over the room we see the front door pushed open and hear the wolf padding off into the darkness
a taxi pulls up in front of a block of flats
an attractive couple gets out
the man pays the driver and the cab drives off
which one harry
number thirty nine but lets go round the back
come on well give sean a scare
youre crazy harry
harry takes her hand and leads her around the side of the flats
the apartments back up to a park and the two walk around to the rear
the park is dark and quiet
did you hear something
here we are seans is the one
the wolf springs
before the woman can scream the wolf whirls around and goes for her throat
we cant see clearly but we see enough to realize how large the wolf is and that its wolfen features are twisted and demonic
the wolf savagely devours its two victims
seans wife is looking through their french windows out onto the park a middle aged couple
sean those hooligans are in the park again
arent you ready yet
theyll be here any minute
somethings going on out there
miss gallagher is helping mrs
hobbs dispense medication into paper cups when dr
he is still wearing his overcoat
is miss price on duty this evening
miss gallagher do you know if miss price has seen the kessler boy since his release
miss gallagher is not sure how to answer
uh i dont know if
alex has walked up and overheard the last
its all right susan
yes doctor i have
come to my office miss price
alex and susan exchange glances as she obediently follows dr
hirsch down the hallway
sean has exited the back of his flat to investigate his wifes complaints
she hangs by the door
he walks deeper into the park
calls out is anyone there
hirsch hangs up his overcoat
sit down alex
alex sits and dr
hirsch leans against his desk
i was in east proctor today
alex looks confused
hirsch realizes the cause of her concern
oh dear girl your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me
i dont give a damn who you sleep with
im concerned about david
its a full moon
where is he
at my flat
im off at midnight and
hirsch picks up the phone
the number alex
sean carefully approaches something near the trees
he steps on something and looks down to see what it is
it is an arm
this is a scare
it continues to ring unanswered
hirsch waits on the phone finally hanging up
hes not there
alex grows worried
alex has david persisted in his werewolf fantasies
well yes but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend
has his friend appeared to him again
what did he say
david says jack comes to warn him
hirsch whats wrong
is this more serious than i know
i tried to investigate the attack
there are no records
the case was closed and now theyve misplaced the file
davids lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before i did
the goodman boy is already in the ground so hes no good to us
so i went to the pub in east proctor where i was convinced of two things
they were lying
there were no witnesses no escaped lunatic
the whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there
and what else
i think the village of east proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret
im convinced that like david they believe in this werewolf
alex is flabbergasted
youve absolutely no idea where david might be
he knows no one in london besides me
i shouldnt have left him alone
surely youre not suggesting
david has suffered a severe trauma
i myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in east proctor
if all the villagers believe that jack goodman was killed by a werewolf why shouldnt david
and then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf wouldnt he himself become a werewolf the next full moon
oh i dont mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon
but in such a deranged state he could harm himself or perhaps others
what shall we do
lets call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy
the bombed out ruins of this unsavory part of london are stark and uninviting in the moonlight
three old derelicts are huddled around a trash can fire trying to keep warm
a skinny dog is tied up beside them
its ears perk up and he growls in warning
old winston smells something
calls out whos there
the dog begins to whine
let im go
derelict unties winston who takes off running in terror
brave dog that
worried here whos there
an unearthly howl shatters the night
weve heard this sound on the moors
thats not winston
he points out into the night
they strain their eyes something is approaching them
they can just make out its size
mother mary of god
a train screeches to a halt
we are in the tubes of london
only one passenger disembarks and the train goes off leaving him alone in the cavernous hallways
the passenger is a young man rather well dressed
he looks about the platform then at his watch
he walks up to a vending machine to buy a cadbury chocolate bar
as the passenger puts his coin in the vending machine
the camera is on ground level and as we watch the passenger the wolfs legs flash by us
of the passenger eating his chocolate bar
he turns thoughtfully wondering if he had heard something
satisfied that he is alone he begins his walk down one of the long serpentine tunnels that make up londons tubes
he feels hes being followed and turns slowly to look
there is no one and he continues concerned about his imagination
watching in the darkness
our passenger approaches the first escalator pauses then gets on going swiftly and silently up the moving stairway
in profile we can see its ragged razor sharp fangs and black tongue
it waits panting drool falls from its mouth
the passenger reaches the landing and walks briskly down the long tunnel marked escalator to street level
he is being followed
he hears it and we hear it
he stops frightened
long and empty
is there someone there
we hear the wolfs heavy breathing
the passenger is beginning to panic
i can assure you that this is not in the least bit amusing
he looks around wildly
i shall report this
we see the wolf at a great distance trotting down the tunnel towards us
turns to flee his jog becoming a run
he is terrified
of the wolfs running steps
frantically running falls to the ground hard bloodying his nose
he scrambles to his feet crying out in fear
reaching the escalator he begins to run up the moving stairs falling several times
he sits panting and defeated the blood trickling from his nose
as it begins to climb the stairs
the camera tracks slowly in on the increasingly horrified passenger until we are in an extreme closeup of his eyes when we a scare
the tiger paces in its cage and roars again
we are at it is early morning and all the animals are aroused
we cut around to roaring cats screeching monkeys and panicky birds etc
until we come to the wolves cage where we find david naked and curled up on the ground by the cage asleep
david wakes up slowly
he is completely naked his body dirty with several scratches on his torso and legs
he yawns and stretches makes a face and with his finger picks something distasteful from his teeth
he also notices something under his fingernails and as he goes to clean them he suddenly does a complete stan laurel discovering where he is
he puts his hands over his eyes
wake me up alex
he slowly peaks through his fingers hes still there
he stands up and looks around
the zoo opens and women with prams and children hustle about
david sees them coming towards him notes his lack of clothes and decides it would be better for all concerned if they did not meet
he looks around for a suitable hiding place and dashes behind some bushes
he crouches down so that he cant be seen scratching himself on a thorn
alex sits holding davids torn t shirt
she is trying to read her book but is just too distracted
the phone rings and she runs for it
excited then disappointed hello
hirsch he hasnt come back yet
yes i will doctor but i just feel so helpless sitting here doing nothing
thank you yes goodbye
she hangs up and looks around the empty flat
she is now more worried than ever
david is still behind the bushes
he looks to see if the coast is clear then stands up and parts the bushes
he steps out to confront a dowager lady
excuse me wont you
he returns to the bushes
a little boy with four helium balloons on a string is staring intently at the gorilla
the little boy leaves the monkey house and we travel with him as he looks at several other animals
eventually he comes to the wolf cage
the little boy looks around
little boy with the balloons
the little boy pantomimes who me
david cannot be seen
come over here
the little boy shakes his head
the bush replies if you come over here ill give you a pound
the little boy shakes his head
the bush pleads
the little boy shakes his head
the bush reasons listen two pounds is a lot of money
its almost five dollars
very english i dont know who you are
im the famous balloon thief
why would a thief want to give me two pounds
losing patience come here and ill show you
the little boy starts cautiously towards the shrubbery but stops a few feet away
pleading come on
the little boy edges forward
a little closer
when the little boy gets within reach david grabs his balloons and uses them to cover his crotch
david runs off through the zoo naked but for his balloons startling several animal lovers
an elderly couple sits feeding birds their coats folded nearly over the park bench
a naked blur darts by grabbing the top coat as it passes scaring off the birds
the little boy tugs at his mothers coat
a naked american man stole my balloons
a naked american man the famous balloon thief
the signs they always have on london newsstands proclaim man or monster
hirsch picks up a newspaper with its headline london murder victims found partially devoured
ill have one of those too
he pays for the papers
the second ones headline death toll up to six new jack the ripper
in another part of town
the camera is on the crowd of fifteen or twenty people waiting for the bus
when the bus pulls up they all crowd in
the camera goes to floor level and slowly examines the footwear of the crowded bus
passengers are standing in the aisle and the camera slowly pans on their galoshes boots high heels rubbers etc
until it comes to rest on a conspicuous pair of bare feet
we pan up to find david clad only in a womans rain coat with a fur collar trying to look as nonchalant as possible
a man looks at him oddly
cheerfully a lot of weather weve been having lately
the man studies david carefully
alex sits in the kitchen drinking tea and reading
there is loud knocking on the door
alex rushes to open it and david enters quickly closing the door behind him
he is still wearing the womans coat
where on earth have you been
he goes into the bedroom and takes off the coat and gets dressed as alex watches in amazement
david is excited even euphoric
alex ive lost my mind
i woke up at the zoo
but you know what
i feel terrific
waking up at the zoo thats not so insane
having no clothes on
what did i do last night alex
dont you remember
i said goodbye to you
i was locked out of the flat
i climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window
i started to read and then i was naked at the zoo
big smile i guess i am out of my fucking mind
alex sits next to him and puts her arm around his shoulders
i worried about you
we didnt know where you were
david kisses her a desperate kiss and she kisses back with equal passion
where did you get that coat
hirsch is dialing the phone
the phone rings
ill get it
alex goes to the phone
the telephone conversation is intercut between alex and dr
alex have you heard anything
alex speaks softly so that david wont hear her
excited is he all right
why didnt you call me
where was he
he doesnt remember
he woke up at the zoo
is he rational
yes he is
hes very excited and confused but hes not crazy if thats what you mean
have you read the papers today
have you listened to the radio or television
is david acting strangely
no not really
could you get here without any trouble
yes i should think so
now listen carefully
i want you to bring david here
i want him in my care
ill notify the police that weve found him
it is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital
do you understand
youre certain hes lucid
you wont need any help
well come right over

hirsch hangs up checks a piece of paper and then dials again
yes scotland yard
alex and david are walking
the next corner we can get a cab
grins i should be committed
hirsch will know what to do
stretches i dont know why i feel so good
i havent felt this good in a long time
alex is signaling for a taxi
my body feels alive alert
i feel like an athlete
a taxi pulls up alex opens the door
saint martins hospital
as they drive
its like the days of the mad barber of fleet street isnt it
i beg your pardon
concerned what murders

a real maniac this one
adamant pull over
the cab pulls to the sidewalk

david gets out of the cab
she hurriedly hands the driver some money and takes off after david

he turns and faces her
i am going to the cops
theres a full moon tonight
jack was right
angry jack is dead

david takes off walking briskly down the street
alex has to jog to keep up with him
david please be rational

he strides up to a bobbie on the corner

alex runs up

shouts queen elizabeth is a man

the bobbie takes davids arm roughly as pedestrians start to gather

frustrated yelling thats what i want you to do you moron
to bobbie sir hes very upset

david approaches one of the onlookers
dont you think he should arrest me
well im not sure
how does he know this isnt a prank
despair a prank
the bobbie has lost all patience
ive no time for this foolishness
to onlookers nothing to look at
the bobbie walks away
david is beside himself
softly david lets go now
david turns in a rage
leave me alone dammit
you people are crazy
ive got to get away from here
ive got to do something
worried david dont lose control
approaching hysteria control
get away from me
he begins to cry
leave me alone
he runs out into the street
cars slam on their brakes just missing him
its too late
hes lost in traffic
alex stands for a moment not knowing which way to turn
david is running in panic
he finally comes to rest in an alley
he sits down and sobs uncontrollably
alex sits distraught in the chair opposite the desk
hirsch is talking to lt
villiers and sgt
the forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved thats true but i hardly think
interrupts regardless of what you think lieutenant the fact remains that david is missing and that we must find him
mcmanus before nightfall

kessler as quickly as were able
he tried to have himself arrested
interrupts getting arrested isnt all that difficult miss price

he and sgt
mcmanus pause by the door
i cannot accept a connection between david kessler and last nights murders

the two policemen exit
hirsch looks at alex

he hangs up in profound depression
leaving the booth he sees an outdoor clock
he sighs then catches sight of something
there stands jack now truly rotted and ghastly
hes pretty much dried out a third of his face gone revealing the grinning skull
he waves to david
jack points inside the theater and goes in
david smiles walks across the intersection and up to the box office
two and a half quid please
david reaches in his pocket
all he has are travelers checks
will you take a travelers check
david signs a check and hands it to her
keep the change
well thank you sir
she gives him a ticket
david goes in
a film to be determined plays on screen
the small theater is mostly empty
a few snoring bums and wide eyed children are scattered about
jack sits in the last row in the shadows
he waves to david
david goes and sits next to him
they sit for a while watching the screen
what can i say jack
you dont have to say anything
arent you going to say i told you so
if i was still alive i probably would
you look awful
apologizes quickly i didnt mean it
i dont know what im saying
im not even sure it was me who killed those people
i dont remember doing it
what about the zoo
well even if im not the wolfman i am crazy enough to do something like that
i mean here i sit in leicester square talking to a corpse
im glad to see you jack
i want you to meet some people
sitting down the row from jack is a man gerald bringsly completely in the shadow
david kessler this is gerald bringsly
gerald is the man you murdered in the subway
we thought it best you didnt see him as hes a fresh kill and still pretty messy
in shadow very english yes i do look most unpleasant
the camera pans down to show the blood dripping from the seat to a puddle on the floor
horrified why are you doing this to me jack
this isnt mr
he is your good friend whereas i am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities
bringsly im sorry
i have absolutely no idea what to say to you
youve left my wife a widow and my children fatherless
and i understand that i am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolfs bloodline is severed and the curse lifted
bringlsy leans forward almost into the light he glistens
you must die david kessler
david this is harry berman and his fiancee judith browns
the two victims lean forward from their seats next to mr
we can just make out that harry has one arm missing
and these gentlemen are alf ted and joseph
the three derelicts sit next to harry and judith
all are slick in the darkness the light from the screen illuminating their gore
cant say were pleased to meet you mr
defeated what shall i do
adamantly you must take your own life
thats easy for you to say youre already dead
harry and i and everyone you murder are not dead
to jack why are you doing this to me
because this must be stopped
how shall i do it
not sure enough
i could hang myself
if you did it wrong it would be painful
youd choke to death
let im choke
do you mind
the mans a friend of mine
well he aint no friend of mine
i know where he can get a gun
dont i need a silver bullet or something
be serious would you
david puts his head in his hands
ive gone totally mad
a gun is good
you just put the gun to your forehead and pull the trigger
if you put it in your mouth then youd be sure not to miss
thank you youre all so thoughtful
as the conversation continues the camera pulls back from the grisly tableau
david grabs his head suddenly
the clock strikes eleven
the full moon is up
david is dripping wet and shaking violently
three small children the oldest nine stand in the aisle staring at him
gasps out in anguish go away
the children watch fascinated as davids seizures grow more severe
his face contorting run
his hands clutch the arms of his chair
coarse thick hair splits his skin
the childrens eyes widen in fascination
roars and screams come from inside the theater
the ticket taker at the door says to the ticket lady ill check on the house
he goes inside the theater
the ticket taker enters the theater
the movie continues on screen but all else is quiet
he cautiously continues down the aisle
he sees something and makes his way towards it
he looks down in horror
from way up high we look down on the sidewalks and single out two bobbies running furiously to the cinema through the busy traffic
the two cops run up the ticket lady is hysterical
its horrible horrible
theres a beast
a mad dog
its killing people in there
one cop stays with the lady the other rushes inside
the cop enters a side door to find several bloodied corpses
he hears something looks over to see the wolf hunched over a victim
the wolf turns eyes blazing mouth dripping with blood
we see it clearly for the first time
it is truly a hound from hell its wolfen features a hideous sight
its eyes fierce burning green
the wolf roars and starts for the cop
the cop rushes out and slams the door behind him
as the cop bolts the door shut
for gods sake tom theres a monster in there
the doors shudder as the wolf begins to batter them down
the cops strain to keep them shut
call for assistance and tell them to bring guns
pedestrians start milling around
the door is bulging
the wolfs roars continue
will you people get out of the way
alex is asleep
hirsch wakes her
nurse hobbs said theres a disturbance in leicester square involving some sort of mad dog
i doubt it
but its something to do
an officer unlocks a rack of rifles which are distributed to uniformed men
police cars arrive sirens blaring
officers are pushing the crowd back as other men help hold the door closed against the wolfs battering
another police car pulls up and out steps lt
villiers and sgt
what the hell is going on here
its some kind of animal sir
suddenly the doors splinter apart and there stands the wolf eyes blazing
it leaps on lt
villiers savaging him
the crowd falls back in panic
the wolf runs into traffic a cab swerves to avoid hitting it and plows into fleeing pedestrians hurling one through a shop window
mass confusion as orders are shouted and the police pursue the wolf
it runs down an alleyway into a cul de sac
it stops in the darkness blocked by a brick wall
the wolf whirls around defiant roaring
the cops quickly barricade the entrance to the alley
the taxi is halted by the traffic jam in leicester square
police vehicles roar past
she jumps from the car before dr
hirsch can stop her
the police arrive with weapons and efficiently ring the alley
alex runs to them
let me through
stand clear miss
i must get through
alex dodges the cop and runs into the alley
the officers shout after her
hirsch reaches the police line
alex walks towards the dark end of the alley
is it you
is it true david
shes almost to the end
the wolf lays in wait in the shadows
the police raise their weapons
the wolf rears up
in that brief instant alex realizes it will kill her
the guns blaze
the wolf falls dead
alex leans on the wall numb
the cops dr
hirsch and sgt
mcmanus run to the dead wolf only to find david naked and riddled with bullets
alex begins to weep
song the fifties rock version of blue moon
