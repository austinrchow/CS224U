royal august the rumors of my promiscuity have been greatly exaggerated
olive penderghast a cute teenager speaks directly into the webcam atop her computer
let the record show that i olive penderghast being of sound mind ample breast size and the occasional corny knock knock joke do enter this video blog into evidence in
the case against me
because im being judged by a jury of my peers i will attempt to insert like and totally into my confession as much as possible
so here it goes
i confess im in no small part to blame for the vociferous gossip that has turned my varsity letter scarlet but for anyone hoping that the sizzling details of my
sordid past will provide you with a reason to lock the door and make love to a dollop of your sisters moisturizing lotion youll be gravely disappointed
look i just need to set the record straight and what better way to do that than to broadcast it on the internet
so here it is part one the shudder inducing and cliched however totally false account of how i lost my virginity to a guy at a community college in a
let me just begin by saying that there are two sides to every story
this is my side the right one
olive sits with her best friend rhiannon abernathy a brash teenager
it would be safe to say that these girls are definitely on the b list at their school
george is not a sexy name
george is like what you name your teddy bear not the name you wanna scream out during an orgasm
there are lots of sexy georges
olive starts to say something but rhiannon interrupts her
shouldnt that alone be enough
from way back
he was hot
ben affleck played him in that movie
charlize theron played that butt fucking ugly lesbo serial killer
besides hes from another century
were speaking present day
i mean jesus mortimer was probably a sexy name in some era
what are you
hes one hot mutherfucker
just face it
theres no such thing as a sexy george
well mine is
so i think we should just put this conversation to bed
i hate you
rhiannon folds her arms and pouts
olive continues to narrate into her webcam
let me back up
i dont know if any of you have ever met them but rhiannons parents are quite possibly the creepiest people in a four county radius
abernathy s sit on their couch smiling at the television in their horrifically rustic home
abernathy bares a striking resemblance to ukelele player tiny tim
although the man were looking at has an even more frightening smile
abernathy has hair to her ankles and dresses like a mormon
ive always felt sort of sorry for rhiannon but not enough to do what she was asking me to do
we float upwards to rhiannon is on the phone agitated
into the phone please
im begging you
ill pay you
olive is on the other end of the phone conversation
we intercut between the two sides
rhi i cant
i told you i have plans
youre a lying bitch and i hate you so much right now
im not lying
i promise im not
i really would love to go camping with your family this weekend
i had fun with your family last year
olive uncomfortable and rhiannon bored sit around a campfire with the abernathys
the couple stare at the fire with the same creepy smile plastered on their faces
there is an excruciatingly long and painful silence
would you like a marshmallow olive oil
abernathy squeaks out a meek titter that is annoyingly high pitched
very very funny
no thank you mr
you can call me mortimer olive branch
abernathy titters again
rhiannon rolls her eyes
there is another awkwardly long silence while the abernathys grin away at their fire
rhiannon is getting increasingly angrier at her friend
into the phone why dont you just say it
you dont like my parents
you think theyre hopelessly pathetic and devoid of souls and wish that you could live with normal people who didnt meet at a star trek convention
she quickly catches her faux pas and stops talking
sympathetic to her rhi i like your parents
but i cant go camping this weekend
hurry and make up a lie
i have a date
you dont know him
and neither do you you selfish bitch
he goes to the community college with my brother in denton
whats his name then
youre totally trying to come up with a name
just say it
into the webcam im not proud of this
less about the lie and more about the unoriginality of it
okay have you guys ever watched the brady bunch
of course you havent
youre busy watching fake people pretend to be real on mtv
thats why i knew i could get away with it
see there was this episode where jan the awkward middle child made up a boyfriend to assuage the ridicule of her snatchy sister who had just stolen the heart of
the boy that jan loved
the name of her imaginary boyfriend
into the phone george glass
what kind of a fucking name is george
hes pretty hot and he asked me out this weekend so i said yes
although still skeptical she seems a tad more mollified
if youre choosing him over helping me cope with two days in the wilderness with these people who even im not convinced arent serial killers he had better be the
you had better fucking marry him have fucking babies with him and then take him for fucking everything hes worth
rhi and olive continue their conversation as rhi pops a tater tot into her mouth
with her mouth full youre not off the hook you know
i want lurid details
this had better be the best date of your life to counterbalance the worst weekend of mine
im sure youll have a good time
rhi sits bored and uncomfortable while her parents smile at the campfire for an again awkwardly long moment
to her webcam through the proverbial even though we now hate each other rhi i really hope youre watching this
because this parts for you
the lurid details of my weekend en flagrante delicto with the all too imaginary yet surprisingly satisfying george glass ken nordines beat poem olive from the late s album colors
underscored to jazz plays as we see a montage of in her bedroom olive watches the notebook pining over ryan gosling
paints her toenails jungle red
sits and thinks that its drab
sits and sits and sits and sits and about its olive drab drab
dances to the jazz music but alone in her underwear and a t shirt that declares hands off
that it is about to be named color of the year by those with the nose for the new
by the passionate few
reads teen people magazine
olive is definitely in
that can possibly mean
at least for a year
dances some more
has got to be olive
did you hear that olive
know what it means
therell be olive cars and olive trucks and olive chickens and olive ducks and olive socks and olive garters and olive brakes and olive starters
and olive trees
what a quaint notion
out of breath from dancing she walks over and displaces the needle from the ken nordine album shes playing
to the webcam but on monday when rhi asked me how my weekend was
olive and rhi walk with books in hand to class weaving in and out of people
it was nothing short of perfection
wait first i need a scope of reference
who would play him in the movie of your life
ryan gosling definitely
he was charming
a real gentleman
are you going to see him again
it was just one of those weekends
the whole weekend
rhiannon suddenly stops and twirls olive to face her
wait a minute
no of course not
you fucking liar
you totally lost your virginity to him
pedestrian students stop in their tracks to stare at them
i did not
olive grabs her and drags her forward interrupting the show
tell me everything and spare me the coquettish just the tip bullshit
i know you did it
i know you let him put it inside you so just tell im not that kind of girl
the kind that does it or the kind that does it like a fucking porn star and then doesnt have the balls to talk about it
rhi drags her into the and abrasively gets up in olives face
i want every perverted detail
pressured olive lies
we did it
you lost your virginity
now youre a super slut like me
blowing peter tolliver once behind the pizza hut doesnt make you a super slut
there were people walking past
whatever this isnt about me
this is about you
what did you let him do
i started piling on lie after lie
it was like setting up jenga
a well manicured female hand stacks wooden jenga blocks onto a table
it was sweet
he was sweet
was he big
did it hurt
it was great
like i said
okay thats enough
the toilet flushes and marianne bryant an aryanesque cardigan wearing christian girl exits from a stall and walks to the sink where she vigorously washes her hands while staring at
rhi and olive with disgust
what the fuck are you looking at marianne
just a couple of admitted whores
marianne wipes her hands and leaves the restroom
olives stomach revolves at her now turned public admission
so how was your weekend
i promise its the last time
the abernathys smile at the campfire roasting weiners
rhiannon would rather be anywhere other than there
rhi snorts in contempt of her father and his wienie
into the webcam
marianne bryant as we all know is the president of the christian student coalition and is that rare breed of human born with a stick the size of a baseball
bat implanted up her anus
im sure its in some medical dictionary somewhere
marianne and her lackey nina howell whos just as awful as she is pass out flyers
last years cause celebre was the changing of the school mascot which she spearheaded
marianne aggressively shoves her literature into passing students faces
the schools mascot a shirtless muscular kid painted blue and costumed as a devil bursts into the auditorium and begins to rile students up by thrusting his pitchfork in the
the crowd goes wild
marianne melodramatically grabs a passing student by the arm
how can we exhibit school pride when were conveyed to others as satan worshippers
the scared student takes her pamphlet and runs away
now thankfully were the much less intimidating the mascot unenthusiastic and feeling ridiculous walks into the gym dressed as a meerkat
he cant seem to get himself or the student body as excited with the exception of marianne and nina in the stands applauding proudly
the school band is playing goldfinger
across the gym olive sits with rhiannon
what the fuck is a meerkat anyway
beats the hell out of me
but can we just take a moment to applaud the barbara bush high school marching band for their very ambitious effort to learn all of the james bond theme music
in a single year
i personally wish them all the best in their endeavor
i think i speak for all of the female students and faculty and maybe a couple of males when i say that i liked todd much better when he was
i actually looked forward to these disturbing displays of what do they call it
even dressed as a meerkat i still fantasize about him
what are those people called again
the ones that dress up like stuffed animals when they do it
dont let marianne hear you say that word
the last thing we need is mccarthyism at barbara bush
isnt high school already a hotbed of just that
yeah id totally fuck meerkat todd
they both get lost in the thought
into the webcam so of course immediately i knew that the little white lie i told to my then best friend in the ladies room would come back to bite
me on the ass
however even i who my fourth grade teacher stated on my report card has an imagination that should be quickly expunged had no idea how quickly this article of fiction
so now we move on to part two the accelerated velocity of terminological inexactitude
olive loads books into her locker
she sees marianne walk past with nina
they give her a repulsed look
olive decides to nip this in the bud
she catches up to them
hey marianne can i talk to you for a second
nina reluctantly gives them a moment alone
listen what you heard in the bathroom that wasnt true
its actually a funny story
do you ever watch the brady bunch
olive thats your name right
olive knows that marianne knows her name but obligingly nods
im not the one you have to answer to for your depraved behavior
there is a higher power to judge your indecency
the guidance counselor
i hope for your sake god has a sense of humor
oh i have sixteen years worth of anecdotal proof that he does
olive looks over and sees that nina is talking to a group of guys who are looking at olive intrigued
marianne sees what her friend is doing and smiles at olive coldly
youve made your bed
i just hope for your sake you cleaned the sheets
she turns on her heels and leaves olive behind
did i just get saved
she shakes off her attempt and continues on her way walking past the guys who smile at her
this alarms her
hows it going
without stopping im swell guy ive never laid eyes on before
thanks for asking
all i could think to myself was great now im going to have to start wearing red lipstick and stiletto heels
battling her frustration she goes to class
olive eats dinner with her family
her father dill s is a regular dad kinda guy
her mother rosemary s is heavyset with a fun disposition
also in attendance is her a little too precious sister olive and her folks get along really well
hey you guys know that i was here all weekend right
they all nod at her
and you would testify to that
whats up sweet pea
just the rumor mill
whats the rumor mill turning out these days
seriously its nothing
they continue to eat
dont forget your brothers staying here next weekend
he never comes home
theyre fumigating the dorms
and thank god for that
last time i was there i saw three cockroaches
mom can you please not say that word while im eating
into the webcam like all families mine has a deep dark secret
and since im spilling all this dirt i might as well go ahead and confess it
she takes a deep breath
im trusting that this nugget of information isnt going to be spread around but okay here it goes my dads name is dill and my mothers name is rosemary
they were so amused by this that they decided to name all of their children after edible items
with mock emotion my brothers name is sage and my sisters name is ginger
its shocking i know
were like a fucking pantry us penderghasts
but at least my parents didnt meet at a star trek convention bitch
now im just being mean
back to the story
as olive walks through school she is met with a totally different energy
she no longer blends in
guys are checking her out
girls are glaring at her scornfully
shes kind of digging it
so while i would never have classified myself as a wallflower i was now the center of attention and who doesnt love that
jeez if id known that losing my virginity would create such a new persona for myself id have lied about it back in eighth grade
eighth grade sucked
i did get my first kiss back then however
it was gross and kind of turned me off to the whole my tongue in other peoples mouths thing
not to mention the even worse other peoples tongues in my mouth thing
who invented kissing
why is everyone so dead set on sticking their body parts in other peoples orifices
if theres a hole on a person rest assured somebody wants to stick something of theirs in it
in almost complete darkness a very nervous eighth grade olive sits with a scared shitless eighth grade kid
you can hear other pre teens snickering and whispering outside the door
so i think this is the part where youre supposed to stick your tongue in my mouth
its just what ive heard
just give me a second okay
olive presses a button and her watch illuminates
according to my watch you have of them
how do you do that
add so fast
and you also talk like a grown up
im not nearly as smart as i think i am
the kid snickers
he feels a little more at ease
i think its just practice
for when i do grow up
plus dont sweat it
girls mature faster than boys
thats what they say
and its probably the reason im ready to do this and youre not
is it that obvious
so if we didnt do anything would you tell everybody
i will tell everyone you pussied out and the whole school will make fun of you and youll most likely spend the rest of your teen years as a joke
no even worse a cautionary tale
they both laugh
the kid who opted not to kiss the girl
theyll tell it for years
itll be a suburban legend
the kid smiles warmly and gratefully at her
dont mention it
you dont mention it
she extends her pinky to him
they link pinkies and they swear on it
we still have five minutes and thirty six seconds
theres a long silence
im really interested in politics
theres another long silence
finally from outside the door ewwwww
hunter neblett just puked all over the dining room
olive and the kid listen as people scurry from outside the closet
hey were in junior high
vomit viewing will always trump spit swapping
the kid starts to make his grand escape but olive stops him
real fast and you can tell me the truth
its not because im the kid smiles
youre very pretty
he extends his pinky and she links it to hers
he kisses her quickly on the cheek and darts from the closet
olive sits in the closet for a moment contemplating what just happened wondering if he was telling the truth then she opens the door
the coast is clear except for another preteen kid walking past
she aggressively grabs him and pulls him into the closet with her and promptly thrusts her tongue into his mouth
they make out
olive seems lost in thought
she snaps back to reality and the task at hand
if id known that meerkat todd was going to turn out so hot i probably would have cherished the moment more
i suppose just that im sitting here reminiscing about it means that it must have meant something
yeah so anyway kissings not really my thing
thats what i learned in natalie giblins closet
olive half listens in class while her english teacher mr
griffin early s a handsome guy lectures on the so im feeling like the cats ass because everyone thinks ive been deflowered
im surprised at how empowered i felt by this prevarication
i wonder to myself would i feel this invigorated if i had actually let some college kid violate me in his cockroach infested dorm room
ironically we were studying the scarlet letter but isnt that always the way with these teenage tales
the literature you read in class always seems to have a strong connection with whatever angsty adolescent drama is being recounted
i consider this
then i think except for huckleberry finn
i dont know any teenage boys who have ever run away with a big hulking black guy
alright so thoughts
nina raises her hand
griffin points to her
i think hester prynne was excuse my language a whore
you dont see her as a victim
why should i
she brought it on herself
nina whips around and gives olive a look surprising her
perhaps you should embroider a red a on your wardrobe
perhaps you should get a wardrobe you twat
the class bursts into surprised laughter
griffin tries hard to suppress a congratulatory glance in her direction
admittedly not my best line
but it was provocative enough to land me in the principals office
griffin begrudgingly calls her to his desk
he starts writing something on a piece of paper
olive sits with her arms crossed outside of the principals office
she clenches a note in her fist
marianne whos an office aid has a smirk on her face as she watches olive squirm
she slams her fist down on the stapler repetitively
seems as if someones on a downward spiral
seems as if someones practicing the mundane activities shell be saddled with the rest of her pathetic life
you have a chip on your shoulder the size of texas
wow thats even bigger than your ass
youre going to hell
growing weary of this as long as you wont be there
oh i can assure you i wont
neither says anything for a few moments
i hope you at least had the good sense to wear a condom
your parents didnt
you know youre just like the principals door opens and marianne quickly shuts up and continues her work
two kids emerge
one obviously a bully the other obviously the bullied
the bullied kid is holding a bloodied tissue up to his nose
he and olive exchange meaningful glances
principal gibbons s a colossal prick disguised as a man gestures for her to come in
olive gets up and enters he closes the door behind them
he holds his hand out and she gives him the note that mr
gibbons studies it
i dont know you
she thrusts her hand out
he eyes her hand not amused and she quickly withdraws it
why are we just now meeting
using language like this should have warranted a visit to me years ago
well to be perfectly honest ive never used an epithet like this in an educational arena before
this is foul
in my defense i think i meant to say twit
it just came out more whats the word im looking for
a young lady with such an extensive vocabulary shouldnt be stooping to such vituperations
as serious as a heart attack
wipe that smile off your face consulting the note olive
i dont tolerate this kind of language
consider this your first warning
if i find out youve used a word like this in my school again i will make sure that its your last
i dont operate on a three strikes youre out system
you get one warning from me
she starts to say something think very carefully before you speak
she relents but stares him squarely in the eyes
i always do
are we finished
he gestures to the door
detention tomorrow after school in room
and young lady i dont want to see you again
not even in a more positive capacity
maybe i could win a ribbon or a medal or something
i could conceivably be valedictorian
get out of my office now
she quickly runs out of his office
rhiannon excitedly approaches olive dying to talk to her
please tell me the rumors are true
yes im a big whore
not that one
the one where you called nina howell a cunt and then socked her in the nose
its not entirely true
look theres something i need to tell you
rhiannon ignores her sincere attempt to confess
like the exact moment you turned into such a bad ass
i think im in love with you
please tell me you at least left a mark on that scrunched up face of hers
the cunt goes down for the count
rhiannon pulls her keys from her purse and they walk to her car
i want a car
its my only perk
they get into her car
the scene looks the same
olive sits with her family having family dinner
i got sent to the principal today
her parents seem more impressed than upset
this is definitely a first
what did you do
i used inappropriate language in english class
but were reading a book that i personally deem wildly inappropriate for my age group so i felt that it was actually quite apropos
more curious than angry what did you say
olive looks to her little sister and thinks better of saying the word out loud
lets just say it was an inappropriate word
what did it start with
a snide comment from a snotty ass girl in my class
i meant what letter did it start with
thats an odd one
is this one of those new curse words
both her parents wheels are going
theyre both seeking the answer in their heads but are coming up with nothing
she leans over and whispers something in her daughters ear
i dont even know what that means
neither do i
her parents search their brains but nothing is coming to them
noun adjective or verb
think british although they pronounce it differently
well im stumped
whisper it in my ear
excited by the prospect oo
spell it with your peas
now thats a challenge
she begins maneuvering her peas around the plate
does this have something to do with this rumor you were talking about the other night
olive touches her index finger to her nose as she continues to manipulate her food
is there something you want to tell us kiddo
im spelling it out for you as quickly as i can
desperate for attention i got a b plus on my spelling test today
too intrigued by olives admission to really care good sweetheart
rosemary figures it out as olive is assembling the a
oh i know what it is
she leans over and whispers it in dills ear
he nods in understanding
glancing at olives whats a twat
olive quickly scrapes the peas into a pile
its a word that will get you sent to the principals office
whispering into gingers its not a good word
so what was the principal like
the male equivalent
now its dills turn to whisper in rosemarys ear
she nods in understanding
well its the first time since second grade so i guess we cant be too hard on you
what would my punishment have been otherwise
to bed without supper
but im already finished
except for my helpful and profane peas
this grounding thing seems to be taking the country by storm
no phone tv or
ill help you out
i dont have anyone to call
i havent watched tv since they cancelled the illegitimate children of the real housewives of laguna beach and i really only watched that as a joke
id take away your books
all my homeworks on there
but thanks for playing
i guess then im lucky this isnt a regular occurrence
olive gets up from the table and kisses her dad on the cheek
i think we both are
i wouldnt know how to be grounded any more than you know how to ground
i love you
whispering in her ear and im sure that girl was acting like exactly what you called her
you have no idea
she goes over and kisses her mom on the cheek as well
leaving the dining room hows about i go and punish myself
mea culpa mea culpa
she retreats upstairs
how come you guys never get mad at her
because pumpkin of our three darling children we love her best
erupting into laughter just kidding
now eat your dinner
dill chuckles but ginger is not amused
into the webcam
the next day things took a turn for the scandalous
which brings us to part three a ladys choice and a gentlemans agreement
she smiles slyly into her camera
bored olive sits at a desk in a classroom reading a tattered copy of the scarlet letter
shes dressed much racier and is starting to look pretty hot
theres only one other person in the room
the bullied kid seen by olive leaving gibbonss office the day before
the bullied kid is thin as a rail pale as a ghost and slightly effeminate
he looks miserable
not just by this detention but from life in general
are these detention sessions often unchaperoned
i dont think we pose a flight risk
olive laughs to herself
i was just thinking its kind of funny
we havent really talked since that closet incident back in eighth grade
i was afraid you were going to bring that up
so how have you been brandon
i have been fantastic
really really amazing
dont know if you heard but according to my locker im a power bottom
yeah only two days after the custodians had finally gotten around to scrubbing turd burglar off
which if you think about it really contradicts the previous label
maybe your vandal is marvelling at your versatility
brandon shoots her a thats not funny look
but of course im in detention
because gibbons is a homophobe
and i called him a facist
so the rumors are true huh
have you ever met me
i meant about gibbons being a facist
i kind of guessed it that night with the whole kissing thing
the way you ran away
i remember thinking to myself this isnt the first time this kids going to go bursting out of the closet
gold star for you nancy drew
theres a brief silence between them
you know i read this article that said with this whole emo movement it looks like that in a few years the gay kids are going to be the most
popular ones in school
ill come back when im twenty seven for my redo
ignoring his cynicism can you imagine the dance squad full of shirtless guys in tight pants rocking out to britney while the football players sit on the sidelines wishing they
were that cool
thatll be the day
judging from the new look youre sporting im not the only one in a transformative stage
sup with the whore couture
havent you heard
im the new school slut
as a matter of fact i did hear that
i heard you banged a guy twice your age
hes a freshman in college
also heard he gave you crabs
tell me about it
hes not real
the guy i slept with
i made him up
so you started the rumor
well not really
no i didnt
but youre perpetuating it
thats fucked up
theres only one thing worse than these tabloid chasing celebutantes with their vapid minds and their immoral souls and thats the people who want to be like them
did i say i wanted to be like them
no you just want everyone else to think you are
why does it matter if its not who i really am
no offense brando but maybe you could learn something from me
youre saying i should pretend to be straight so people will like me
what a novel idea
you should do seminars
oh wait a minute i forgot
in high school
calm down adolph
theres a vein popping out of your neck
im simply suggesting that maybe these kids we call peers have got the right idea
maybe bridget schumacher isnt as hippy dippy as she pretends to be
maybe thats just the label shes put on herself to avoid having to bathe as often as society deems necessary
or take marianne bryant
its convenient for her to act like a stuck up jesus freak
thinking about this no
i think shes actually just a stuck up jesus freak
but do you think she cares that thats the way shes perceived
maybe she was just sick of being just another nameless faceless entity in a place and a time that reveres people for extremity
brandon realizes why shes chosen this path and feels for her
there are some of us though that want to just blend in to the crowd
then maybe you need to go to that extreme
or make the steadfast decision not to care
even better if you can manage to do both
ive discovered an infallible remedy for teen angst apathy
i cant decide if youre a genius or a lunatic
dont they sort of go hand in hand
she smiles sinisterly at him
i always thought teen angst and apathy went hand in hand
there is an electricity in the air and it seems as if at any moment they might fling off their clothes and screw right there
how am i doing
pretending to be a whore
for a virgin im impressed
how about me
could i pass as straight
for a fag
i prefer the term turd burglar
they both break character and return to being themselves
if we really wanted to shock the world wed get up and leave detention
but you know that we would never do that
isnt going to stop me from telling everybody we did
brandon thinks hard about everything thats just been said
his brain is going a mile a minute
in that noggin an idea has been planted
olive not oblivious to this returns to her novel
olive lounges on her bed flipping through a magazine and talking to rhiannon on the phone
brandy carter was telling vanessa hodges that you lost your virginity to three guys in a jacuzzi
well i guess thats better than me getting crabs from a guy twice my age
who said that
you know that brandon kid
from your seedy pre pubescent closet romp
the one and only
its what somebody told him
nobody talks to him
isnt that sad
hes actually quite the conversationalist
since when are straight guys under the age of eighteen able to converse
a call beeps in on the other line
she clicks over
speak of the devil
hey can i come over
i wanted to talk to you about something
see you soon
olive clicks over to rhiannon
dude that was brandon
he wants to talk to me about something
probably wants to borrow an outfit
thats so mean
any word from george
rhi i told you
it was a one night stand
which is now a done night stand
youre being awfully cavalier about this
i mean he popped your cherry
arent you supposed to be eternally in love with him and shit
if i was a character on a cw show then absolutely id be blubbering all over my teen vogue
hey we should start a rumor that im having a pregnancy scare
olive is stoked by her idea
rosemary opens the door to see brandon
she has no idea who he is
is there an olive here
theres a whole jar of them in the fridge
sorry i must have gotten the address wrong
come on in
brandon walks in and rosemary shouts olive sweetie theres a young man here to see you
he said something about asking for your hand in marriage
brandons eyes bulge and olive descends the staircase
oh happy day mama
i thought i was going to have to spend my dowry on booze and pills to numb the loneliness
olive grabs brandon by the hand and leads him upstairs to she closes the door behind them
my moms an acquired taste
i know this because ive only just recently begun to appreciate her myself
she gestures for him to sit down
welcome to my boudoir
this is where the magic happens
do you wanna go out with me
she looks at him strangely
i mean like do you want to be my girlfriend
brandon just a few hours ago you told me you were kinsey six gay
but you said i should pretend to be straight
well i didnt mean with me
youre a sweet guy and all but youre not really my type
youre not really my type either
i should say not
well do you wanna have sex with me
he nervously nods
oh my god dude
you totally missed my point
all i was saying was that no i know what you were saying
i should play it straight until i get out of this hell and then i can be whoever i want to be
no i got that
brandon i didnt really have sex with a college guy
i just told people i did
well actually i just told one person and well you know how these things work
so youre saying i shouldnt really have sex
i should just say i had sex with someone
now youre cooking with gas
its his turn to smile slyly at her
she sees where hes going with this and instantly gets defensive
oh no no no no no no no no
think about it
we could help each other out
you want to maintain this floozy facade
i want to not get my face pummelled weekly
you are on crack
all it would take is one good imaginary fuck and youd be saving the bone structure of my face
think of how happy my parents would be
this is not the answer
why dont you just do what i did and make someone up
who would believe me
listen olive i dont want to do this
i want to live in that not too distant emo world but i still have another year of this bullshit place and i cant do it
i just cant do it
ill pay you
i can pay you whatever you want
i just dont think it would work
whores arent discerning olive
and just think youll officially be a hooker with a heart of gold
i dont want your money
so if i say yes youre going to tell a couple of people at school and i just have to go with it
i really dont think it will work
his voice cracking with i can make it work
she sees tears forming in his eyes
she walks away from him and is silent for a long few moments
i dont do anything half assed
spinning around to face itll have to be a public event
melanie bostic is having a party tomorrow night
all of your tormentors will be there
you and i are going together
you have to do everything i say and you have to tell people that i was sensational
brandon wipes his tears away and is the happiest gay youve ever seen
he throws his arms around her and wont let go
i cant believe youre doing this
afterwards its up to you
youre committing to something
just make sure youre ready to live with the consequences
it seems as if that last statement was more for herself than it was for him
into the webcam im sure you all remember the party
a teen party rages
drunk kids abound
olive looking like a million fuckin bucks prances into the party with brandon whos looking pretty snazzy himself
they appear drunk and are falling all over each other
people stare in complete amazement at a
their appearance and b
that theyre even together in the first place
youd never guess that this was anything less than an a list teen couple ripped from the pages of teen people
olive falls against brandon laughing
he hoists her up as their host melanie bostic a fairly pretty girl approaches
i hope you dont mind but we had a few pre cocktail party cocktails
well glad you could make it
whispering and slurring in her ear soooo heres the thing
brandon was in the middle of telling me this funny thing
is there a quiet room we can go to where he can finish telling me about his thing
she stares glassy eyed at melanie
brandon just smiles
you can use the guest room
down the hall
i love you
i love you so much
you are just yeah
she gives her a drunken punch on the shoulder
she spins around to the entire party who is looking at them with complete interest
loudly to all hey everybody
they raise a glass to them and brandon and olive stumble down the hallway laughing
shocked mouthing to a what the fuck
the bully who emerged from gibbonss office with brandon goes up to melanie
was that olive with brandon
they with a big group race down the hall where brandon and olive have just retreated to
olive locks the door and drops the drunk act
shes completely sober and so is brandon
draw the shades
brandon runs over and pulls the blinds down
they giggle conspiratorially
olive plops down on the bed and stretches out
brandon lays beside her
she moans for the benefit of the audience she knows has assembled outside
she moans again and its very convincing
she leans over and whispers in his ear grunt
make it really convincing
he does so
she extends her palm impressed
he slaps it with his
sure enough it seems as if most of the party is listening at the door falling all over each other to hear
nearest to the door is the bully who is pleasantly surprised by the noise inside
olive reaches into her handbag and pulls out her copy of the scarlet letter and reads it while she makes sex noises
brandon laughs at this and olive smacks him with it prompting him to stop
she puts her finger over her lips giving him the shhhh sign
she continues to read as she thrusts her hips making the bed squeak ever so slightly
how long do we have to do this
do you wanna be a normal adolescent boy or do you wanna be a stud
he moans in his deepest voice
she continues to read crescendoing her moaning like a pro
oh god brandon
dont stop dont stop dont stop
she takes the top of the headboard and lightly taps it against the wall over and over
now that i think about it we probably dont want to do this for too long
itll give the impression that youre having difficulty finishing
thats not the desired effect
are you sure youre a virgin
of course i am
oh fuck me
dont stop fucking me
brandon suppresses a laugh
olive is disheveling herself
brandon musses up his hair
she unbuttons brandons shirt and rebuttons it incorrectly
go forth my son
youre a man now
he kisses her on the cheek and she smiles
the whole crowd leaning against the wall quickly disperses when the door opens
the bully immediately hands brandon a beer and throws his arm around him leading him drunkenly down the hallway with a crew of guys after the dirty details
olive looks at this and smiles satisfied
then she realizes that though the guys have gone there are a whole slew of girls looking at her completely differently
they avoid her eye contact as one would ward off medusa
olive finds melanie pretending not to be interested in her
is there a
back entrance is through the kitchen
she begins her walk of shame down the corridor into the where she runs smack dab into the well developed chest of sorry
they make eye contact
olive is a sick shade of regret
oh hey olive
obviously oblivious to the demonstration that just occurred hows it going
she doesnt know how she im here
can i get you a beer
olive catches the reflection behind her of a group of guys leaning against the counter signalling no dont do it to him behind her back
she spins around and they instantly pretend to not be paying attention
she glares at them
ashamed of herself i should probably go
she rushes off
into the webcam it was truly my cindy mancini moment
even bobby thinks we went out
all of you thought we were a couple
what a joke
ronald miller paid me bucks to pretend i liked him
what a deal huh
to go out with him for a month
he bought me
and he bought all of you
he was sick and tired of being a nobody
yeah and he said that all of you guys would worship him if we went out
and i didnt believe that
i was like no way
and he was right
no leave me alone
he was right
our little plan worked didnt it ronald
that stupid dance
what a bunch of followers you guys are
i mean at least i got
at least i got paid
sincerely as herself cant buy me love is one of the best movies ever made
you guys should totally watch it if you havent already
or even if you have
seriously fine filmmaking
olive lays on her bed watching the scene from cant buy me love that she just performed
she eats a candy bar and wallows in her self pity
to the television oh cindy mancini
it could have been a lot worse
her mom comes in with a nicely wrapped gift
that kid from the other night just dropped this off for you
indicating an empty space on the floor put it on the pile of gifts from my other suitors
he seems like a nice boy
a dyed in the wool homosexual that boy is
rosemary puts the gift on the floor
i dated a homosexual in high school
were not dating mom
i just wanted to tell you that if you want to date a gay boy it might be hard on your father and i at first
but we love you no matter what the sexual orientation of your opposite sex partner
rosemary leaves chuckling at her own joke
too curious olive opens the gift
she withdraws a photo of the bully holding brandons legs while he does a keg stand
she smiles pleasantly
she pulls out a pink vibrator and looks at it quizically
theres an envelope inside
she opens it and pulls out a gift card to target
cindy mancini gets
i get a vibrator and a gift card to target
theres a note which she reads aloud to herself
dear olive the dildo is just in case you dont shop at target
then you can fuck yourself
olive breaks out into riotous laughter
shes genuinely touched by this gift
the phone rings
thinking its brandon olive snatches it up
your package was perfection
so its true
well its not last nights conquest
you know i always think its so ridiculous on tv when someone picks up the phone and magically seems to know whos going to be on the other end
i usually preface a conversation with hello to avoid such banalities
the one time i decide to step outside this convention
how are you
rhiannon clutching an enormous diet coke plods through the mall with an intensity reserved for girls who just found out their best friend had her sophomore sexual exploit and didnt
bother to tell them
i have many questions obviously
yes virginia there is a santa claus
no in fact i do not know the way to san jose
and little known fact contrary to popular belief panama hats are not from panama at all
theyre from ecuador
now is not the time to be cute
youre putting me in a precarious position because with her best jackie o according to last months cosmopolitan magazine we should always look cute
even when were doing mundane activities such as choosing vegetables from the produce section of our local grocery store
olive stop it
this is serious
did you really bang brandon last night at melanie dipshits party
olive sighs as she slumps into her pillows
is that what people are saying happened
thats what everyone is saying
then i guess its true
does this mean you guys are dating
rhiannon screams in frustration attracting the attention of passing shoppers
just because you lost your virginity doesnt mean you can go around screwing everybody
uh thanks mom
youre getting a reputation
yknow youre really coming off as a little pious right now and youre kind of pissing me off
please forgive my rectitude but i think that a best friends duty is to let her know that everyone and i do mean everyone is calling her a cum dumpster
well do you think im a cum dumpster
look baby i call a spade a spade
entering the red zone first off thats racist
secondly fuck you
how dare you
i was laura ingalls to your lady chatterly and now all of a sudden you feel the need to warn me that im making a fool of myself
there are a lot of children who will never again experience family pizza night because of you
so why dont you jump off your high horse and splash around in the gutter where you belong
i didnt want to believe it but i guess its true
youre a fucktart
and youre a jealous virgin
i totally want to lose my virginity to one of as if it was a disease your brothers friends and then be the first for a fairy while everyone listens
what is wrong with you
does sex mean anything to you
its a period of time how ever short that i dont have to talk to you
she slams the phone down into the cradle and seethes
berlins sex im a
plays loudly as
she goes into her closet and starts wildly pulling down clothes
she throws them into a big pile in the middle of her floor
into her webcam rhiannon abernathy only wishes that somebody wanted to pretend to sleep with her
olive visibly upset is cutting something meticulously out of red fabric
in fact she has yards of red fabric draped across her lap
when she finishes the shape she tosses it behind her and begins another one
olive sews these red scraps to her clothes
when she finishes one piece as before she tosses it behind her and grabs another item from the crumpled wardrobe on her floor
time flies and we see the clothing pile rapidly decreasing until there are none left
the song morphs into tommy james and the shondells crimson clover as we fade into clad in sunglasses fuck me boots and looking like a bona fide porn star olive
struts down the halls of her school
sewn across her larger and pushed up breasts is note for the rest of the film every piece of olives clothing will be emblazoned with a red a
erections are popping up all along the halls as well as looks of total disbelief from the girls
she works it like a debbie who just did dallas dusseldorf des moines daytona detroit and darfur
up ahead rhiannon is yakking with a semi attractive guy named anson
she catches sight of olive and her jaw drops
olive sidles up to anson much to rhiannons chagrin
breathy and aping marilyn i just realized the funniest thing
my name is an anagram for i love
whats an anagram
look it up big boy
she rubs her knee seductively along his inner thigh turns and licks her lips at a repulsed rhiannon and continues on her way
anything sexually suggestive you can do with school cafeteria food olive does as she makes her way through the lunch line as guys ogle her
marianne also present in the line watches her in repugnance
olive emerges from the girls locker room dressed for gym class
a terrified fat kid named evan nervously approaches her
can i talk to you for a second
he gestures for her to follow him underneath the bleachers
she reluctantly does so
dont get mad but brandon told me what you did for him
well rest assured it was equally as thrilling for me
no he told me the truth
she silently seethes
and i was just hoping that maybe you could do the same for me
through clenched teeth walk away evan
evan starts to talk but she raises her hand to silence him
run away evan
i can pay you too
im about six seconds away from slapping you so hard that your unborn grandchildren will feel it
excited at the prospect can you do it in front of everyone
olive turns and starts to leave
evan summons up his courage and meekly states to her back
i dont need your permission you know
she turns around and gives him a look of death
he cant look at her
i mean at the rate youre going im just saying i dont think anyone would not believe it
are you threatening me
ill give you
indicating his body thats the problem
and once again olive feels too sorry for him to say no
i want five hundred dollars in gift certificate form deposited in my locker before noon tomorrow
preferably the gap but ill also take amazon
we did not have sex
i was piss ass drunk and i let you fondle my chest and it was a glorious moment for you unmatched by anything youve heretofore experienced including cake
five hundred bucks for just feeling you up
doesnt that seem a little steep to you
can you throw in mispronouncing it as if it rhymed with cottage frottage
its fraw tahzh dumbass
but it was so good you lasted only twelve seconds and i better not find out that little pecker of yours ever came out of your pants
take it or leave it
for five hundred dollars it was ungodly huge
you even commented on the unusual girth for a guy my age
i was too drunk to remember
he extends his hand
she repulsed by it shakes his hand
the sad thing is evan if you had been a gentleman and asked me out on a date i probably would have said yes
do you want to go on a date
with zero vitriol
not now i dont
sad for him she walks away
into the webcam evan if youre watching this shame on you
i hope you never treat another girl the way you treated me or you will die alone wishing it was because youre fat
and since were playing the shame game
while i appreciate the sentiment lewis a pretend hand job should have warranted a little more than a hundred dollars worth of amc movie passes
they had an expiration date and were only able to be used for movies that had been running for two weeks
but even thats better than tyler jennings who gave me a ten percent off coupon to bath and body works
a fucking coupon
is that how good my imaginary blow job was to you
is chivalry dead
i want john cusack holding a boombox outside my window
i want richard gere climbing up my fire escape with the limo waiting downstairs
i want to ride off on a lawnmower with patrick dempsey
although im ashamed to admit id prefer him to look like he looks now
what woman wouldnt
i get to save two fifty on a bottle of juniper breeze hand lotion
maybe chivalry isnt dead but its in a coma and the prognosis isnt good
so if youre still with me and im guessing that most of you are i now present to you part four how i olive penderghast went from assumed trollop to
an actual home wrecker
griffin is alone grading papers
olive pokes her head in
you wanted to see me
come cop a squat
she takes a seat opposite his desk
he points to the red a on her chest
what are you doing
olive olive olive
do you think that maybe youre reading a little too much into this assignment
well im really hoping to get an she points to her chest get it
im hearing things
she takes a deep breath
the rumors are true
i am in fact considering becoming an existentialist
you know what im talking about
geez since when did teachers become privy to idle adolescent gossip
i guess it wouldnt matter so much if i didnt like you
youre a great girl and i happen to think that all of
indicating her outfit this is just an act
im just curious why youre doing it
olive drops her defenses and gets real
have you ever decided just to play along
because its maybe easier than fighting tooth and nail to defend it
i just dont want to see this he searches for the word damage you
you know i think you should give me extra credit for going the extra mile
im really attempting to understand this puritanical ostracism
griffin smiles at her
hey im really sorry i had to send you to the principal
if you tell anybody ill deny it but i really wanted to cheer with the rest of the class
you know i wont tell
she gets up and leaves but passes in the doorway a to the woman hey mrs
pretending to know who she is hi
how are you
pointing to the a a is for awesome
olive disappears into the empty halls
ive never seen that girl before in my life
that doesnt surprise me
im the guidance counselor
i should know all of the students
especially the ones dressed like that
he kisses her
shes just going through a phase
he gets an idea hey do you think you could talk to her
maybe you could get her to i dunno sure
thats not the girl that everyones talking about is it
oh thisll be good
that snotty office aid has been bitching about her incessantly
its all lies
talk to her
maybe thats all she needs
what are you making for dinner tonight
is it my turn
im meeting up with the girls at happy hour
dont have too much fun
i never do
he kisses her
assembled in a semi circle a handful of well dressed christian kids open their meeting of the cross your heart club with prayer
marianne of course leads them in this ritual
nina is also present
heavenly father watch over us with your all encompassing love
keep us on the path toward your righteousness and eternal salvation
they all smile say amen and open their eyes
we have a problem
amen to that
we need to pray for her but we also need to get rid of her
im sure by now youve all heard about what happened at melanie bostics party
i was there
i heard the whole thing
marianne eyes him suspiciously
thats not something you need to advertise kurt
see herein lies the problem shes doing these tasteless immoral acts in plain view of the entire student body
shes in direct opposition to everything were trying to do for this school which is make it a wholesome learning environment and a place where our children will one day
flourish the way that we are
she was sent to the principals office last week she called me a really hurtful name
and i tried to witness to her but shes defiant to any sort of help
she tears up
i dont know what to do but somethings got to be done
her boyfriend micah takes her hand and holds it
she leans against his shoulder wiping away tears
nina on the other side of her begins rubbing her shoulder sympathetically
does anybody here think that they can talk to her in a way that might get her to see that what shes doing is wrong
she suddenly bursts into sobs
and these arent crocodile tears
she is flooded with emotion
this is so stupid
no its not marianne
she wipes her tears away
jesus tells us to love everyone
even the whores and the homosexuals but its so hard
its so hard because they just keep doing it over and over again
she takes micah and ninas hands the rest of the group follows suit
make me a promise
make god a promise right here and now that we will remain pure and chaste until marriage
looking to micah until our love is proven holy in his eyes
lets continue to pray for olive penderghast
that either she sees that what shes doing is a sin and changes her behavior or that she gets the hell out of our school
they all squeeze hands and marianne manages a smile
awww i love you guys
god loves you guys
marianne gives micah a strictly pg rated kiss against his car
theyre nauseatingly wholesome
olive is sitting in the office dressed just as slutty as the day before
a red a sewn onto her top
marianne is behind the desk sharpening pencils
after each one she observes the point with a scary satisfaction
they exchange a few hateful glances at each other
griffin pokes her head out of her office
wanna come in
olive in no mood for this drags herself up dramatically and follows mrs
griffin into mrs
griffin sits behind her desk and olive sits opposite her
so the reason i called you down here is just so that we could sort of yknow chat about whats going on
theres been some concern from faculty members
griffin shifts uncomfortably in her chair
theres something a little unnerving about this kids awareness
olive youre attempting to make a statement
we get that
im just confused as to what exactly it is
am i in trouble
i promise the hem of my dress isnt higher than my fingertips
youre not in trouble olive
i just wanted you to know that if there was something you maybe needed to talk about that you could trust me
if i open up to you do you promise this stays in confidence
i watch american idol
do not tell anyone
griffin rolls her eyes
i have a reputation to uphold
dont you though
olive assesses this statement from her
if i can think of any angsty things to report youll be the first to know
she winks at her
this has been so much fun that im actually at this very moment considering meth addiction just so i can come back and we can jaw some more
or you could always get pregnant
im probably closer than either of us thinks
griffin digs in her purse and pulls out a handful of condoms
feigning excitement propho tastic
please dont tell anyone i gave you these
the school board is puritanical and oppressive
olive sees that mrs
griffin is genuinely concerned
i dont need those
but you do
olive starts to confess but then just takes the rubbers and puts them in her own purse
remember our little secret
and hey would you send in the next person
griffin smiles at olive as she leaves
marianne is talking to micah who seems distressed
he rubs his eyes like hes been crying
olive is surprised to see him there
youre up hoss
concerned to micah its going to be okay
she gives him a reassuring smile and he walks into her office
let me guess drugs
marianne gives her a go away look
i didnt know christians believed in guidance counsellors
is your boyfriend struggling with his sexuality
marianne begins crying
no you insensitive rhymes with witch
his parents are going
she begins sobbing uncontrollably
olive not sure what to do goes around the counter and hugs her
marianne just cries on her shoulder
its okay marianne
not sure what to say sometimes our boyfriends parents get divorced
its just important to know that its not your fault
through her tears they go to our church
imagine what people will say
olive didnt expect this embrace to last this long
i have to go now
are you going to be okay
into olives shoulder mrs
griffin is going to fix everything
i know that shes going to help micah through this time and everythings going to be okay
everythings going to be okay
marianne pulls away and wipes tears from her eyes
why are you being so nice to me
isnt that what were supposed to do
hey its your bosss rules
this triggers even more wails from marianne who grabs olive and squeezes her tightly
im sorry okay
im sorry for everything i said
i want to be friends
please be my friend
olive is really confused by this display and is about to say something snide but thinks better of it and replies with a very heartfelt absolutely
marianne pulls away again and manages to smile at her warmly
and for a day we were actually really good friends
i was really starting to think that things were going to turn around
marianne angry as hell stomps through the hall with hatred burning in her eyes and coursing through her veins
but then i unwittingly gave her boyfriend a venerial disease
marianne stops in front of olive and slaps her so hard that people in the hallways stop dead in their tracks
its the slap heard round the school
olive bursts into mrs
tear streaked mrs
griffin is packing her things into a cardboard box
its as if her world has just collapsed
and caused the break up of mr
what do you want
olive starts to say something but mrs
griffin cant even look at her
she throws a framed photo of her and mr
griffin into the box
griffin falls apart
olive starts to say something again but she doesnt know what to say so she sheepishly turns to leave
the cross your heart club is assembled outside of the school with a lot of other kids and some parents waving signs on wooden stakes that say things like rhi
is among them as riled up as any
so i guess i shouldnt be too shocked that these people wanted my diseased home wrecking ass out of there
the scene is a maelstrom of anger and piety
the funny thing is the whole time this shit was going down people calling me something i knew wasnt true my best friend included i couldnt help but think how
i could have come up with better signs
no one even bothered to use alliteration or god forbid irony not even a single acronym and that seems a lot more unforgivable than my sins
olive enters a catholic church
its empty but there are a few candles burning
she sees the confessional booth and makes a beeline toward it
she takes a deep breath and enters
she sits down and begins to talk to the screen
forgive me father for i have sinned
i think thats how youre supposed to start these things
im only going on what ive seen in the movies
then i think im supposed to tell you how long its been since my last confession but thats kind of my first confession
im not catholic
i really dont know what im supposed to do except sit here in this booth and tell you what ive done wrong
where do i even start
ive been pretending to be a how would one phrase it in catholic words
its not like ive actually been doing the things that people are saying im doing but then again im not denying them so ive just been wondering is that wrong
theres a lot of shi crap going down at my school which may or may not be indirectly because of this masquerade
i may have caused the end of a marriage
i thought in my own perverse way that i could help it
i mean in my defense i am merely an adolescent
i should never have been propositioned in the way i was propositioned by an adult
but then again i should never have consented
it was just that a lot of people had been asking me to do things and i thought it was okay because it wasnt real
it was make believe and no one was getting hurt
but a lot of people hate me now
i kind of hate me too
theres a long silence
olive tears up and wipes them away
i could be wrong but arent you supposed to say something or ask me questions
tell me to say hail marys
she looks through the screen
theres no one there
oh come on
she throws the curtain to the booth open and stomps out
olive upset at herself gets into her car and drives off
but just a few blocks down the street to she parks her car and gets out to try a different denomination
olive enters to find a sweet portly receptionist s searching through religious clip art on her computer attempting to find the perfect image for the church newsletter
the lady smiles acknowledging olive
i was wondering if the minister was around
pastor mcgreevey is on vacation this week
but our associate pastor is in
would you like to speak to him
for her own entertainment olive matches the receptionists enthusiasm level
actually that would be fantastic
can i tell him what this is regarding
im looking for a church to join and i thought he might be able to sell me on this fine establishment
the receptionist joyfully snatches up the phone
don theres a young lady here who would like to speak with you about joining
she listens and then hangs up
pointing to an office you can go right in
if everyone here is as friendly as you i think we might be in business
she winks at the receptionist and enters associate pastor don s is a gangly unattractive borderline creepy man
he invites olive to have a seat
hello there young lady
my name is don
he extends his hand which she shakes politely
how can i help you today
im new to the area
looking for a church hopefully something with a strong fellowship a firm foot in the soil of
divinity and was wondering what your churchs stance on lying and adultery was
don seems taken aback by the question
its not a good thing
oh i agree
but tell me assuming there is a hell maam the presbyterian church recognizes the existence of hell
lets say hell exists
which is worse lying or adultery
or is lying about adultery like a double whammy
im sorry maam i what did you say your name was
at that moment olive looks at his desk and sees a framed family photo
smiling big are associate pastor don his wife a woman with a smile the size of montana and his lovely she jumps up from her chair and recoils at the
sight of the picture and the stupid mistake she made by coming there
you know what
i think im just going to go and check out judaism
backing up toward the door
the jews and i have a lot in common
so thank you for your time
she bolts from his office
olive speaks into her webcam
i had unwittingly sought advice from the father of the leader of my lynch mob
who else can say thats happened to them
as much as i want to say i hate marianne
i get her
well i get certain things about her
she always thinks shes right
and yeah i can kind of understand why she slapped me that day
heres what happened
marianne excitedly runs over to olive who is just getting to school and throws her arms around her
remember how i said that we were bffs for like a day
well thats true
it was like we were sisters all of a sudden
marianne cant seem to break the embrace and olive just goes with it
olive sits in class
marianne passes a note back to her
she wrote me a note in first period
olive reads it
it says hey girlie
you wanna hang out after school today
marianne marianne looks back and olive gives her the thumbs up
across the room rhi sees this exchange and sneers
marianne is working with her partner evan
she turns to olive behind them and makes a gagging signal behind his back and laughs silently
by second period it was like we had private jokes
olive unaware of how to respond gives another thumbs up
olive sees marianne come into class tear streaked
she runs over to olive and again throws her arms around her
tragedy struck in third period
micahs in the hospital
hes in so much pain
the nurse didnt know what was wrong
olive just holds her new friend as she had the day before
hell be okay
tears glistening in her really
olive guides mariannes head back to her shoulder
mariannes boyfriend micah writhes in pain on a hospital bed clutching his crotch
his worried mother s is beside him clutching her chest with one hand and trying to soothe him with the other
it hurts so bad
a doctor enters with a satisfied smile and a diagnosis
micah and his mother both look up in shock
his mother takes both of her hands and begins slapping him uncontrollably
how did you get chlamydia
who have you been sleeping with
micah in pain from the burning sensation and his mothers hands flying at astonishing speed shouts out olive
his mothers face fills with satisfaction
micahs mother is on her cell phone
she folds her phone up and slips it into her purse
the woman on the other end of the phone a woman with a smile the size of montana who weve seen in the bryant family photo hangs up
only this time her smile is a disgusted grimace
she picks up the phone and dials a number
she is animatedly talking to the person on the other end of the line while olive narrates
fourth period was when marianne had office duty
her duties included typing stapling filing and marianne is on the phone listening with mouth agape
undoubtedly shes just heard from her mother that her boyfriend has chlamydia
answering the phones
she screams so loud that mrs
griffin comes out of her office a panicked expression on her face
seething mariannes mother says into the phone olive penderghast
she hears a slam and then a dial tone
marianne clutches the phone in the cradle with enough force that it looks like the receiver will shatter in her hands
griffin looks worried
are you okay hon
like a teapot about to start expelling steam marianne quivers in rage
finally at boiling point she shouts but her long string of profanities is muffled by the long ringing of the school bell
griffin is taken aback by mariannes umbrage
as we saw before marianne angry as hell stomps through the hall with hatred burning in her eyes and coursing through her veins
okay i exaggerated
we were just bffs for like a half a day
marianne stops in front of olive and slaps her so hard that people in the hallways stop dead in their tracks
clutching her face mutherfucker
rhi who was loading books in her locker sees this and happily slams her locker shut
breezing past her my sentiments exactly
oh grow up
but rhi keeps on walking
micahs on his cell phone anxiously talking to someone checking every few seconds to see if his mom is on her way out
into the cell phone i didnt know what to say
i said i got it from olive penderghast
i know but what was i supposed to say
and then my mom called her mom
no not olives
i already tried to blame it on their divorce but my moms not buying it
i have to tell them
but i love you
i dont care if you gave me chlamydia
i love you and i want to be with you and no one can stop us
not my mother not marianne not theres a dial tone
griffin has just hung up on her teenage lover and begins freaking out
she grabs a cardboard box and begins throwing items into it
olive bursts into mrs
griffins office and sees mrs
griffin packing her things
as we saw before
what do you want
olive starts to say something but mrs
griffin cant even look at her
she throws a framed photo of her and mr
griffin into the box
griffin falls apart
olive starts to say something again but she doesnt know what to say so she sheepishly turns to leave and then feels awkward
im sorry i was just looking for marianne
did she say something about being mad at me
she just smacked the shi crap out of me
this makes mrs
griffin cry even harder
she attempts to pull herself together
its my fault
im so sorry olive
olive looks at her quizzically
i fucked up
i fucking fucked up so fucking bad
im a fucking
dont get me wrong
i love it but i dont think youre supposed to use those words around a student
yeah well youre not to supposed to fuck them either
but it didnt stop me
olive puts two and two together in her head
she gasps a little louder than she planned
you and oh my god
im not judging you or anything but oh my god
what does that have to do with me
griffin walks over and locks her office door
she fights back more tears as she tries to explain to olive
my guidance counselor who had only days before armed me with a latex bulletproof vest told me that she had chlamydia and that she had been screwing around with her
office aides boyfriend under the guise of divorce counseling
she confided in me that she and her husband my favorite teacher were having marital problems that they hadnt slept together in months
she assured me that she had never meant for anything to happen with micah
she confessed to me how when she was a child she always dreamt of being maria von trapp not mary kay letorneau
micah had panicked and used me as a scapegoat to save her job and her marriage
she assured me that she would make sure everyone knew the truth and apologized
griffin stops talking and waits for olive to speak
and i bought it
olive gives her a reassuring smile steps up to the plate and offers up a solution
i could have chlamydia
and i could easily have given it to micah
that time we slept together
often times women dont have symptoms and i have been whoring around
no you havent
olive looks at her puzzled by her knowledge
because a real whore cant admit it to herself let alone others
she begins to weep
olive puts her hand on mrs
tell him i said hes an asshole and that he owes me so big for this and also the time i pretended not to see him during a third grade
game of hide and seek
tell him i still remember that
but tell him that i confessed to giving him chlamydia
griffin grabs olive and cries on her
and its not really my place to say this but i figure after the conversation we just had i can speak candidly
your husband is hot and while the male adolescent can fuck like a bunny
who really wants to fuck a bunny
if i was you id go home and seduce him and pretend this never happened
olive strokes her guidance counselors hair
do you want some more condoms
no you keep them
she strokes her hair
into the webcam so really how could i be angry at marianne
dude if some bimbo gave my boyfriend an std id have swung but id have balled my fist
she gets lost in the with all the mythical play i was getting its a wonder and probably a miracle that i still hadnt actually been asked out on a
guys were clamoring to claim that theyd slept with me but no one was putting the real moves on me
two little year old girls olive and rhiannon chase a little boy all over the playground desperate to kiss him
they plot and plan to corner him but hes just too fast
it was really rhiannon who had a crush on him
she has since we were kids
rhiannon finally catches him and kiss him on the cheek
repulsed he wipes his face
rhiannon and olive high five each other
olive eats her lunch and yuks it up with a table full of guys
rhiannon sits at a different table mostly comprised of girls and glares at her from across the room
the bell rings and the students begin getting up and making their way toward the exit
anson who we saw earlier with rhiannon in the hallways approaches olive
olive smiles sweetly at him
i was wondering if you were busy tonight
maybe wanna go out or something
what did you have in mind
i was thinking about chartering a hot air balloon taking along a bottle of champagne and fresh fruit and then trying to impress you with an overzealous reading of emily
why anson are you inviting me to accompany you to a romantic dinner at the red lobster
ill have dinner with you
olive walks off olive and anson sit in a booth at a dimly lit red lobster
olive looks beautiful
the a on her shirt is sequined
i cant believe you brought me to the nicest restaurant in town
this is swank
i was beginning to think that there was no such thing as class
whats better than getting to select your dinner and have nice conversation while they boil it alive in the back
i think anson jr
doesnt mind making the sacrifice
you dont mind that i named him anson jr
not at all
im actually kind of honored
do you believe this whole thing about lobster being an aphrodisiac
lying out his ass i didnt know it was
yknow medical science has not substantiated claims that any particular food increases sexual desire or performance
its so funny when guys ply women with food that they think is gonna get them laid
i mean whats really sexy about slurping back oysters
you know native people believed that you gained the strength of the animal by consuming it
some people grind up rhinoceros horn because its thought to stiffen the male sex organ
its all bullshit
and spanish fly
its pulverized beetle that people eat
although its illegal for human consumption in the united states and do you know why
because if you take just a bit too much it causes painful urination fever and bloody discharge
a server appears with their lobster
anson is an odd shade of green from olives little science lesson
the server leaves them and olive digs in
anson is feeling nauseous and cant touch his
from across the restaurant a parade of servers enters from the back enthusiastically clapping and holding a cupcake
leading the brigade is meerkat todd whos wearing a red foam with as much spirit as he has as a meerkat i dont know but ive been told
i dont know but ive been told
he leads them through to another part of the restaurant
i didnt know meerkat todd worked here
and hes a lobster
i wonder if i should start calling him lobster todd
marguerite is getting old
marguerite is getting old
they land at the table of the birthday girl
olive cranes her neck to see rhiannon miserable of course sitting with her parents at a table in the next room
olive immediately becomes uneasy
the best thing is her dessert is free
the best thing is her dessert is free
the worst thing is i sing off key
the worst thing is i sing off key
olive is visibly squirming in her seat
happy birthday to you
the whole place applauds unenthusiastically
anson sees olives discomfort
rhiannons over there
shes been in love with you since the first grade
well shes my best friend
i thought you two werent speaking
were not but it doesnt mean i should be out with you
then why are you
i dont know
you asked me out
i have no interest in her
i mean were friends but
she cant see us
do you want me to get the check
would you mind
he gestures for the server who appears
could we get our check
is everything okay
i just remembered im allergic to shellfish
i always forget that my respiratory system would collapse and id die
it sucks i know
even more confused the server obliges and gives them their check
digging in her purse let me get it
i have a gift certificate
she pulls it out and hands it to the waitress who leaves
but i asked you out
and i ruined it so let me bear the financial brunt
im so sorry about this
but she really likes you
she and i just dont have much in common
and you and i do
i think so
for instance i too think nina howells a twat
yeah well if thats our magical connection i should date the entire school
olive suddenly becomes self conscious and a little bit pissed
yeah about that the server reappears with the check
you have a remaining balance of fourteen dollars and thirty six cents
the sever smiles and leaves them again
lets get out of here
they duck out of the booth trying to keep their heads down but olive cant resist the urge to look up and see if rhiannon sees them
olive and rhiannon make eye contact
whereas olive looks remorseful rhiannon looks like shes just been stabbed in the back which she has
the abernathys see her as well and wave
its painfully obvious to olive that rhi hasnt told her parents about their differences
she starts to go over but rhiannons face is turning vermillion in anger
olive just waves sheepishly and leaves with anson
olives face is painted with guilt
she feels like shit but doesnt want to externalize it
anson puts his hand on her knee
i have something for you
olive manages a smile
he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a gift certificate to anthropologie and hands it to her
olive is disappointed but tries not to show it
i didnt realize snapping out of her guilt
so what did we do on this date
whatever gets me
he leans over and kisses her
she pushes him off
this isnt how it works
i dont actually but hes kissing her again a little too forcibly
she pushes him off again
you dont get it
im not technically having sex with people for money
you know that right
besides even if i was were in the parking lot of a red lobster
we can go wherever you want but i think it would be kind of hot here
he takes off his shirt
dude i gotta go
its been sad
she gets out of the car
he rolls down the window
olive youre being stupid
ill take you home
he drives off leaving her outside in the parking lot
as luck would have it meerkat todd is coming out the back exit
he sees her and gives her a surprised toothy grin
what are you doing here
oh im just hanging out in the parking lot
i do that sometimes
not necessarily just here
the one outside of applebees is fun too
laughing at her oddness you want a ride somewhere
your friend rhi is inside
its her moms birthday
tears begin to glisten in olives eyes
shes not my friend anymore
todd walks over and puts his arm around her and leads her to his car
he opens the door for her and she sits down
olive is trying to pull herself together but she cant stop crying as todd drives her home
todd doesnt know what to say to her
finally you wanna talk about it
whats to say
im a horrible person
everyone thinks im a whore and for the first time im starting to believe it
oh dont act like you dont know what people are saying about me
i know what people are saying
doesnt mean i believe them
olive contrary to popular belief im not an idiot
i know exactly whats going on and i know exactly what youre doing
she stops crying
who told you
no one had to tell me
all i know is once upon a time there was a scared little kid in a closet at a party who wasnt ready for his first kiss and there was
this amazing little girl who lied for him
she smiles through her tears
you remember that
yeah and after i ran out you pulled brandon in
yeah i know about that by the way
and look how he turned out
sometimes i still pretend you were my first kiss
olives laughter turns to rage
about a year later
blurting it out she knew how i felt about you
how do you feel about me
she did it first
and here i am feeling soooo bad and that bitch
how do you feel about me
i said felt
he stops the car
theyre at her house
off his look i mean its not that i dont still feel that way
theres an awkward moment between them
if i promise not to tell anyone could i kiss you
despite the fact that this is positively the most romantic moment of her young life olive looks down
i dont want you to kiss me when mascaras running down my cheek or some shithead has forced his tongue down my throat only a half hour ago
ive wanted to kiss you since the eighth grade but i want it to be perfect
and right now my lifes a mess
i need to get it under control before i drag you into it
what if i told you i wanted to be dragged into it
maybe i could help
he holds out his hand and she takes it
now i have a reason to fix this catastrophe ive brought upon myself
and im going to
he smiles his goofy grin and she embraces him
she hops out of the car and goes to her front door
into her webcam you see now i had a reason for things to go back to the way that they were
the truth needed to be told and i knew i had to go the one person who could help me
the one person i could count on to set the story straight
id helped him and even though it would destroy his new reputation for being a stud i knew he would help me
filling the frame a gossipy girl in braces says oh my god did you hear that brandon ran away from home
he left his parents a note that said eff you im gay
and then he skipped town with a big hulking black guy
we spin around to see olives stunned reaction
my apologies to mark twain
the reality of the situation begins to weigh on her
defeated olive makes her way through the crowded halls
it gets worse
due to his condition micah was sent on an extended visit to his grandparents in mississippi
micah beyond miserable sits between his stern grandparents who read the bible to him
no telephone no television no computer no internet and most importantly no diseased sexual partners
micah settles in for a very long visit
where they had previously met olive pleads with evan
i went to everyone id helped and begged them to say it wasnt true
i gave you money
he walks off leaving her alone
olive waits for mrs
theres a long moment of contemplation on mrs
then olive life is full of choices
i made a bad one
but then so did you
we both acted unwisely but i dont see any other alternative than to live with the guilt
my guilt stems from my indiscretion yours for lying
weve made our choices
now we have to ride them out
pissed as hell or i could just tell everyone the fine olive
lets play the who do you believe game
but first ask yourself if you were an adult who would you believe
with all due respect mrs
griffin youre a fucking cunt
because you helped me once im not going to report that to principal gibbons
now were even
theyre locked in a mexican standoff
you can go now
furious olive throws the door open and exits
griffin is erasing the blackboard when olive storms into the room
your wife has chlamydia and shes been sleeping with a student and she gave it to him and now shes trying to blame me
griffin drops the eraser
the gravity of what shes just done sinks in and she stumbles
i im sorry
i not knowing what to say she runs from his classroom
olive is mirthless as she proceeds with her story
looking back thats the thing i regret the most
thats the thing that sent me to the church er churches
and thats the thing that made me realize how profoundly id fucked up
and thats something ill have to live with for the rest of my life
with my words even though they were true i ended a marriage
no kid should have to be burdened with that
she contemplates this
as we saw before olive sits and plays connect four with mr
griffin at his desk
both are looking beaten down and very depressed and their minds are on everything but the game
griffin puts his hand on olives
its not your fault
olive gets a tear in her eyes
she puts a red chip in at the top and loses the game
she reaches over and presses the lever causing all of the chips to fall on his desk
theres a ridiculously tall tower of blocks and they all fall down
he rakes the chips and the game into his own cardboard box full of his things
he smiles and she hugs him intensely tears quickly welling up in her eyes
im so sorry
its not your fault
they just hold each other
griffin pulls away and takes his things and starts to leave
but then he turns and says
i hope that you and todd end up okay
where are you going
not sure yet
away from her
can i come
they share one last pained smile and he leaves
hearfelt into the webcam mr
griffin if you ever see this just know i was wrong to tell you that
in that way
i dont know
i shouldnt have done it
i dont feel bad for lying for your wife
but i hate myself for telling you the truth
im so sorry
she wipes away a tear pulls herself together
part five not with a whimper but with a bang
as we saw before the cross your heart club is assembled outside of the school with a lot of other kids and some parents waving signs on wooden stakes that
say things like rhi is among them as riled up as any
olive steps out of the school to see the demonstration
her jaw drops
oh fuck me
things have gotten way too out of hand
olive cries on her bed clutching her teddy bear
rosemary listens as a good mother does
so now everyone who knows the truth is either gone or wont fess up
the cross your legs club is demanding my head
and the messed up thing is that i wouldnt put it past gibbons to expel me
i had a similar situation when i was your age
everyone called you a whore
i had a horrible reputation and people said awful things about me
but it was true
i was a slut
olive gives her a suspicious look
im waiting for you to say imitating her mother just kidding
no its true
i slept with a whole bunch of people
it was a different time
i got around
before i met your father i was a garden variety floozy
why are you telling me this
because i endured a similar lynching because of a certain dalliance
i promise that it was no worse than marianne bryants attack on me
it was her mother
don bryant and i got caught in a very compromising position in the locker room during a basketball game
he wasnt back then
he was actually pretty handsome
all im saying is that maybe the reason that bryant girl is going after you is because her mother told her about me
so the sins of the mother are revisited on the daughter
theres something else you should know
this is hard to say but don bryant is your father
marianne is your sister
olive turns white
well about the sister thing but not about the don thing
actually that happened a couple of times before we got caught
olive punches her mother on the arm whos laughing hysterically
i hate you so much right now
cant you see im a mess
no youre not olive
and youre going to handle this the same way that i did
with an incontrovertible sense of humor
they embrace and olive gets an idea
thanks for the pep talk mom
now get out
i need to make some phone calls
rosemary looks slightly concerned by the grin on olives face
we join a pep rally already in progress
the dance team attempts to rile up the school with a rousing rendition of michael jacksons bad
in the stands rhi sits with marianne and nina
so olive wasnt at school today
she extends her palms to nina and rhi who both slap them
marianne puts her arm around rhi
im so glad youre with us now
you guys fucking rock
we dont say that word rhiannon
just say effing instead
we effing rock
marianne nods in agreement however rhi is confused
but isnt that just implying the same word
we have so much to teach you
its okay to imply things
rhiannon looks at her new best friends who just smile at her
the song ends and theres a drum roll
its time for meerkat todd
i just want to rip that costume off him and marianne puts her hand firmly on rhis knee
why dont you just not talk for a while okay hon
rhi puts her head down
the drum roll ends and meerkat todd bounces out in costume
he jumps around enthusing the student body but then he goes out of the gym and reenters pushing a the familiar chords of the james bond theme nobody does it
better plays from the band
meerkat todd opens the lid of the dumpster and olive dressed in a glittery and slinky red dress with a boa draped around her bare shoulder pops up and croons
with a handheld mic and slightly different lyrics
nobody does it better
makes me feel sad for the rest
nobody does it half as good as me
baby im the best
todd lifts olive out of the dumpster and she sings her ass off and shes quite good
i wasnt lookin but somehow they found me
i tried to hide from your love light
but like heaven above me the guys who loved me are keepin all my secrets safe tonight
she winks at the audience
the guys begin to wolf whistle and howl at her sheer brilliance
she begins to rub her hands seductively over meerkat todds furry costume eventually unzipping it and taking off the head to reveal blue devil todd
the crowd goes wild
and nobody does it better though sometimes i wish someone could
nobody does it quite the way i do
whyd i have to be so good
she saunters over to rhi and kisses her on the cheek leaving a big red lip mark
the way that they hold me whenever they hold me theres some kind of magic inside you
that keeps me from runnin but just keep it comin
howd you learn to do the things you do
she sees that gibbons is not amused but that doesnt stop her
oh and nobody does it better
makes me feel sad for the rest
nobody does it half as good as me
darlin im the best
she walks over to a couple of horn players and runs her fingers seductively over their uh instruments
the crowd goes wild some appalled but most enthused
olive sashays through the crowd as the male teens scream and stuff money down her bodice
baby youre the best
darlin youre the best
baby youre the best
the song ends and olive takes blue devil todds hand
to the student body this is just a free preview
for the main event log on to www
com tonight at p
now i know this conflicts with tonights basketball game but cmon would you rather be here cheering on the meerkats looking at todd or watch me do one
there are audible gasps but excitement nonetheless
gibbons angrily storms over and takes the microphone
through gritted teeth young lady to my office
yeah i cant
im gonna go bang my boyfriend while the whole school watches
but good luck with the game thing
she plods out triumphantly
the sun is setting as olive speaks into her webcam
but this time were not seeing it through the lens but from a different point in the room
and here you all are
waiting outside the closet door for me to kiss todd listening to me pretend to have sex with brandon paying me to lie for you calling probably the last virgin
in school a whore
all of a sudden from outside and downstairs james laid begins to play
olive goes over to the window and sees todd below holding up a boombox a la john cusack and theres a ride on lawn mower a la patrick dempsey behind
upon seeing this she bursts into laughter but it couldnt be more romantic
who told you that i loved this song
i see youve been watching my live webcast
its still going on you know
theyve had enough of you
well figuratively speaking
i borrowed my neighbors john deere
come down here
be right down
olive cant get the smile off of her face as she goes back to the camera
we see her through the lens
not that i owe any of you any more confessions but im really in love with him
and i am going to lose my virginity to him
im not sure when
it could happen five minutes from now or tonight or six months from now or maybe on our wedding night but the really amazing thing is that its nobodys business
as an afterthought like totally
she turns the camera off
olive runs out of the house and tackles him kissing him in the front yard in broad daylight for the world to see
the basketball game is going on to an almost empty gymnasium
we see from the perspective of their computer screens various reactions to olives webcast a proud brandon watches from a hotel room
a muscular black guy in a towel comes up behind him and kisses his neck
the abernathys watch with the same demented glee they derive from watching anything
griffin watches with the face of a person whos been found out and whos days are numbered
rhi seems contemplative
maybe its because shes been in love with olive since grade school
evan the fat kid is doing jumping jacks while watching
melanie bostic the host of the party watches with a group of girls
told you guys
marianne feels regret
but a little bit impressed
griffin is proud of her
micah watches in his dark bedroom
what are you doing in there
you had better not be on the sin ternet
rosemary and dill are too busy making out to watch
anson has a jar of vaseline and is ready to jerk off but is upset that she isnt exposing herself in the aforementioned way
i thought she was going to take her clothes off
olive and todd are still kissing on the lawn underneath the stars
