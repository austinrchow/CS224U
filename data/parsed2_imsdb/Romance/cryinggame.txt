b if window
href b b the crying game the crying game a loudspeaker playing percy sledges when a man loves a woman as we see a carnival in the distance with a
ferris wheel turning round and round
a black man is by a stall
on his arm is an irish girl with blond hair
the black man is drunk and is tossing rings around a bowling pin
and thats cricket hon
an attendant hands him the teddy bear
it looks ridiculous in his huge hands
he gives it to the girl
you want it
doesnt matter if you dont
he puts his arm around her and drags her on
jody wont be offended
jodys never offended
whatd you say your name was
suits you jude
the teddy bear
no fuck the bear
and its june
jude in june
he comes to a small canvas tent with a sign on it toilet
gotta piss jude
he holds her hand
dont run off jude
you dont know me do you
jody walks inside the canvas flap and vanishes from sight
we can still see his hand holding judes
she leans against the canvas looking bored
inside what if i did
youd know i wouldnt run off
she stands there listening to the sound of him urinate
her eyes flick around the carnival
they settle on a tall dark haired man in a dark jacket
never pissed holding a girls hand jude
and you know what
tell me jody he staggers out buttoning up
he goes to kiss her
she turns her head away
who gives a fuck
you never know
she pulls him over toward the water
i never know nothing
they could be looking
jody follows her as she walks backward drawing him on
he moves his hips to a song as jude leads him over the beach under a train trestle
come and get me soldier whatever you say jude
he sinks down on his knees toward her
she wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him
jody writhes on top of her fumbling with his belt
jude cocks one eye upward
a shadow falls across them
close on jody kissing her
a gun is put to his head
he turns around drunkenly
what the fuck the gun whacks him across the cheek and he falls sideways
jude scrambles to her feet and darts like an animal through a field
jody feels his cheek
he can see her blond head vanishing among the fields
he looks up and sees a group of men around him
the tallest of them fergus cocks the gun
a mini driving down a country road
two men in the front three in the back
on the floor of the car jody lies with three pairs of feet on top of him a black bag over his head and the barrel of a gun dangling
close to his face
fergus holds the gun
he is smoking a cigarette
his movements are slow and somewhat innocent
so whats your name soldier
jody pulled through and tied to a chair
maguire a small lean man talks to him through the hood
the situation is simple
youre being held hostage by the irish republican army
theyve got one of our senior members under interrogation in castleraigh
weve informed them that if they dont release him within three days youll be shot
youll be treated as our guest until further developments
have you anything to say
jody is motionless under the black hood
give him a cup of tea
do you want a cup of tea
he still says nothing
all the men are drinking tea
the blond woman comes in with a plate and some food on it
see does he want some
do you want some food
jody sits as still as a grave saying nothing
late at night it is dark
the men are sleeping
fergus is sitting by a chair gun in his hand watching the prisoner
jude comes in with a flashlight
hey whats he like
did you give him it
there are certain things i wouldnt do for my country
have a look at him
poke him or something
see if hes still alive
hes all right
hasnt moved for twelve hours
have a heart
she moves over to him
she prods him in the legs with her foot
he doesnt move
then she lifts the hood ever so slightly to peer inside
suddenly the man moves like lightning jerking his head down so the hood comes off throwing his body tied to the chair over jude
you fucking bitch you fucking whore he pins her to the ground his body bent with the chair
he writhes on top of her in a grotesque parody of love
she is screaming and the room is alive each man awake grabbing guns screaming
turn the fucking thing off fergus follows jude out a back door holding her by the arm
you all right
she takes in huge gobs of air
you dont know that
i had him all over me
he touches her face
tough work that
someones got to do it
she rubs her hand on his chest
nah it was a breeze
just thought of you
she sidles closer coming on to him
and you know what fergus
one of you made me want it
she puts her lips to his neck
she doesnt answer
a hot summers day
there are tall hedges all around the house
fergus leads jody still bound and hooded over toward a greenhouse
dusty tomato plants and vines everywhere
the sun pouring through
fergus leads jody over to a wrought iron chair and sits him in it
he sits opposite gun on his lap
fergus takes some sandwiches out of a brown paper bag
he holds one out toward him
eat something would you
what do you mean you cant
cant eat through a canvas bag
fergus walks over to him lifts the hood up so his mouth is revealed and pushes the sandwich toward his lips
jody eats slowly
this is a farce man
how is it a farce
i seen your fucking face
so what do i look like
youre the one about five ten with the killer smile and the baby face
and the brown eyes
fergus pushes the last crumbs of the sandwich toward jodys mouth
youre the handsome one
jody eats the last bits
thank you handsome
jude makes her way from the door toward the greenhouse
she is carrying a pot of tea and two cups
it is sweltering now in the greenhouse
close on jodys cowled head
the hood is drenched with sweat
i cant fucking breathe man
be a christian will you
jude comes into view
tell him to take the hood off honey
jude says nothing
lays the tea on the ground
how did you know it was her
i can smell her perfume
jude pours out the tea
see if we took the hood off wed have to shoot you
as it is youve got a fifty fifty chance
thought you liked me bitch
it was fun while it lasted
his breathing becomes labored
please man im suffocating in here
cant we take it off
have to check with himself
fergus gives her the gun
you look after him
jodys head follows fergus while he leaves
dont leave me with her man
jude smiles holding the gun on her lap
maguire and the others
maguire has a newspaper which has a headline regarding the kidnapping
made the front page
theyll move now the fuckers
request permission to take the hood off tommy
why would you do that
the poor whores suffocating in the heat
and anyway hes seen our faces
he described me down to a t

maguire reads the paper
youre his keeper
if you dont mind him seeing you i dont mind
but youre the only one he looks at
its your decision
jude drinking tea looking at jody sweating
he puts his arm casually around her
leave us judie
fergus walks to jody and slowly takes the hood off
jody looks up at him his face bathed in sweat
he breathes in mighty gulps of air
thank you soldier
never thought fresh air would taste this good
fergus pours out a cup of tea and brings it to his lips
now if you took the ropes off id be able to feed myself
no fucking way
you know i was wrong about one thing
but youre no pinup
not handsome at all
you trying to hurt my feelings
its the truth
well i could say the same about you
but i wont

fergus looks at him
jody isnt smiling anymore
fergus goes back to his seat and drinks his tea
he fingers the gun on his lap

theyre going to let that guy die
and youre going to kill me

ferguss hand emerges with a wallet

he keeps looking at him
and by the way its not paddy

take it easy now
just go slow
down by that tree
he walks toward it breathing heavily
youve got to loosen my hands
well then youre going to have to take my dick out for me aren t you
fergus in the dark stands motionless looking at him
come on man im going to wet my pants
fergus turns him around and unzips his fly
take the fucker out man im dying fergus takes jodys penis out
jody takes two steps toward the wall
i gotta lean forward or ill dribble all over myself
will you hold my hands for me
fergus holds his hands from behind so jody can lean forward
jody now pisses with immense relief now that was worth waiting for
hurry up would you
these things take time fergus
he shakes his body
its amazing how these small details take on such importance
he steps back
now put it back in
give us a break
i cant do it
its only a piece of meat
for fucks sake its got no major diseases
fergus puts jodys penis back in his pants and zips him up
i had a case of the clap two years ago
crabs in ulster
but all in all its served me well
shut up would you
didnt mean to offend you fergus
fergus leads him hack toward the greenhouse
fergus leads jody back to his chair
i know that wasnt easy for you
he begins to laugh
the pleasure was all mine
fergus begins to laugh without knowing why
maguire walking out of the house woken by the sound of laughter
jody still laughing
suddenly the hood is slammed back over his head
maguire standing there in the dark looking at fergus
what the fuck is this
hes just got a sense of humor thats all
youre on duty
keep your fucking mouth shut
go in and get some sleep
fergus gets up slowly walks toward the door
get some sleep
fergus walking toward the house
he looks back and sees the figures of maguire and jody in the dark in absolute silence
maguire sitting with an armalite in his hands watching him
the sun coming up over the low hills around the farmhouse
fergus enters with a tray and some breakfast
maguire is sitting where he sat before stock still
did he talk
maguire shakes his head
didnt make you laugh
maguire shakes his head
have some breakfast
he hands maguire a plate
good morning fergus
maguire looks hard at him
so he knows your name
i told him
are you all there
he rises and drags fergus out the door
back in a minute jody youll have minimal contact with the prisoner do you hear me
and do you know why
because tomorrow we might have to shoot him thats why
maguire goes back to the house
jody sitting with the hood on again
they giving you trouble fergus
fergus says nothing
he takes a plate and brings it toward jody
ysee theres two kinds of people
those who give and those who take
fergus lifts up jodys hood to expose his mouth and begins to feed him
ah take the thing off man
fergus says nothing and keeps feeding him
dont mind if i prattle on do you
fergus shakes his head and says nothing
i will take it by your silence that you dont
fergus feeds himself then feeds more to jody
two types fergus
the scorpion and the frog
ever heard of them
fergus says nothing
scorpion wants to cross a river but he cant swim
goes to the frog who can and asks for a ride
frog says if i give you a ride on my back youll go and sting me
scorpion replies it would not be in my interest to sting you since as ill be on your back we both would drown
frog thinks about this logic for a while and accepts the deal
takes the scorpion on his back
braves the waters
halfway over feels a burning spear in his side and realizes the scorpion has stung him after all
and as they both sink beneath the waves the frog cries out why did you sting me mr
scorpion for now we both will drown
scorpion replies i cant help it its in my nature
jody chuckles under his hood
so whats that supposed to mean
means what it says
the scorpion does what is in his nature
take off the hood man
cause youre kind
its in your nature
fergus walks toward him and pulls off the hood
jody smiles up at him
i was right about you
dont be so sure
jodys always right
both men dozing in the heat
where would you most like to be now man
doesnt matter where
come on man
if this shit was all over
having a pint in the rock
you lack imagination fergus
think of something more alluring
like having a pint in the metro fergus laughs
having two pints in the rock
having a pint in the metro and dils having a margarita
my special friend
we got simple tastes you and me
but you fellas never get a break do you
we do a tour of duty and were finished
but you guys are never finished are you
we dont look on it like that
ive often wondered how you do it
depends on what you believe in
what do you believe in
that you guys shouldnt be here
its as simple as that
put that thing back on him fergus
doesnt matter if hes hot
just cover the fucker up
have you no feelings woman
you shut your face she pulls the hood down over him
youre heading for trouble fergus hes a good soldier jude
she whacks him with a pistol
i said shut the fuck up he believes in the future jody sitting in the hood
fergus lifts it a bit jodys mouth with blood now in his lips
is it bad
women are trouble you know that fergus
some kinds of women are
she cant help it
dil wasnt trouble
no trouble at all
you liked her
present tense please
whatever she is
im thinking of her now fergus

if they kill me dont think that way
but they will
as sure as night follows day
they have to
i want you to find her out
tell her i was thinking of her
fergus is moved
he cant reply
see if shes all right
i dont know her
take her picture
fergus walks toward him
in the inside pocket
their faces close to each other as fergus searches out her picture
take the whole lot
i wont need it
i told you not to talk that way go to millies hair salon in spitalfields
take her to the metro for a margarita
dont have to tell her who you are
just tell her jody was thinking stop it the door opens
maguire is there with another
fergus turns toward him
we need you inside
fergus walks toward maguire and the other man walks forward takes his seat
fergus unseen by maguire puts the wallet in his pocket
maguire jude fergus and the others
weve had word
theyve used every trick in the book on him
hes starting to talk
youre going to have to do it in the morning
maguire lights a cigarette
fergus looks at him and nods
you ok about that
im a volunteer am nt i
i was beginning to have my doubts about you for the last few days
not the only one
shut up jude
you best get some sleep tonight fergus
request permission to guard the prisoner tonight youre crazy
dont let him peter
shut the fuck up jude
he turns back to fergus
he puts his arm on ferguss shoulder
why do you want to do that for
would make me feel better about it
you sure about that
youre a good man fergus
fergus takes his place in the chair beside jody
jody begins to laugh under the hood
it turns into the sound of crying
the crying stops
how can i
i dont know
just help me
give me a cigarette
fergus takes out a cigarette lights it and lifts up jodys hood so he can smoke
dont even smoke you know that
it just seemed the right thing to do
fergus watches him puff the cigarette the hood just above his lips
jody coughs but keeps the cigarette in his lips
fergus gently takes the cigarette from his mouth
go to sleep now
i dont want to sleep
tell me something
like the one about the frog
and the scorpion
tell me anything
when i was a child
i thought as a child
but when i became a man i put away childish things
what does that mean
tell me something anything
fergus is silent his eyes wet
not a lot of use are you fergus
no im not good for much
the farmhouse covered in mist
the sun coming through it
maguire opens the door to the greenhouse and clicks the chamber of his gun
fergus has a gun in his hand
he checks the chamber
fergus takes jody whose hands are still tied behind his back by the elbow
stand up now jody rises
fergus leads him through the door past maguire
i wish to say on behalf of the irish republican army fergus turns with sudden fierceness
leave him be he pulls jody through the fields
fergus pushing jody through a copse of trees the gun at his back
take the hood off fergus no
i want to see a bit
dont make me die like an animal
fergus pulls the hood off
jody looks around him
he has a cut lip where jude struck him
fergus prods him on with the gun
jody stumbles forward
fergus is all cold and businesslike
im glad youre doing it do you know that fergus
cause youre my friend
and i want you to go to the metro stop that talk now hurlings a fast game isnt it fergus
faster than cricket
crickets in the halfpenny place
so if i ran now theres no way id beat you is there
you wont run
but if i did
you wouldnt shoot a brother in the back jody suddenly sprints and loosening the ties on his hands then freeing them he is off like a hare
fergus screams in fury after him
fergus aims then changes his mind and runs
you stupid bastard what you say faster
i said you bastard stop got to catch me first fergus gains on him stretches his arm out but jody sprints ahead again as if he has been playing with
he laughs in exhilaration
fergus pants behind him wheezing almost laughing
used to run the mile you know four times round the cricket pitch what was that game called
hurling jody runs whipping through the trees always ahead of him
come on fergie you can do it a bit more wind fergus grabs his shoulder and jody shrugs it off gaining on him again
bit of fun fergus eh
and suddenly the trees give way
jody turns laughing to fergus
told you i was fast fergus is panting pointing the gun at jody
dont do it
and suddenly a saracen tank whips around the corner hits jody with the full of its fender
his body flies in the air and bounces forward as another tank tries to grind to a halt and the huge wheels grind over him
fergus screaming no
he almost moves forward then sees soldiers spilling from the tank around the body
fergus turns and runs
fergus whipping through the trees his body crouched low as he runs
tinker sitting in the greenhouse
a helicopter screams into view through the panes and automatic fire comes from it shattering every pane in seconds and tearing tinker to bits
bullets whipping through every window taking chunks from the masonry tearing the walls apart
maguire jude and the others on the floor scrambling for weapons
fergus hearing the gunfire runs through overhanging branches till eventually he is hidden from sight
a forlorn looking building over nondescript fields
an old man wheels a bicycle slowly toward it a rusty car appears and fergus gets out of it
youre back in the pink tommy
howre you keeping
the old man pouring whiskey into a teacup
youll notice ive asked you nothing
thats wise tommy
all right then
i like to be wise
he pours fergus more whiskey
so what do you need fergus
need to go across the water
do you now
need to lose myself awhile
he looks at fergus and lights a cigarette
theres a man i know ships cattle to london
the ferry churning into the sunset
fade up into an elegant empty georgian room covered in clouds of dust
a figure among the clouds of dust hacking at a wall with a sledgehammer
it is fergus dressed in laborers overalls covered in dust
he is knocking the bricks from an outer wall
he works furiously and relentlessly like a machine
we see the wall with the hammer striking it
one brick falls away then another
daylight pours through the clouds of dust and the growing hole
ferguss face as he works
more bricks falling away
through the clouds of dust and the streams of daylight we now see a patch of green
ferguss face working
his rhythm slows
more bricks fall away
then the hammer stops
the dust begins to clear
the jagged hole
the dust drifts across it revealing a cricket pitch with tiny sticklike figures running on the green
fergus returning from work crosses the street and enters through a white door
he puts on a cheap suit like any country boy in a big city
he takes jodys wallet from the trousers of his overalls
he flips it open sees the picture of the soldier and dil
he puts it in the pocket of his suit
fergus walking down a street looking for an address
some distance down the street is a sign millies unisex hair fergus standing as the crowds go by him looking in the window
he has the picture in his hand
we see dil from his point of view then fergus walks inside
the door gives a loud ping
ill see you tomorrow dil she leaves the salon
you want something in particular
just a bit of a trim
dil checks her watch and stubs out a cigarette
she gestures toward a chair
fergus sits down
she comes toward him and fiddles with his hair
she pushes his head back into a basin behind him
she begins to knead his hair in hot water and shampoo
someone recommend you
in a way
guy i work with
whats his name
fergus cant think of an answer
the hands with the purple nails run over his scalp
doesnt the water get to your nails
whats it to you
fergus sitting up
she begins to cut
howd you guess
the accent i suppose
and whats it like
she imitates his accent saying it
dil raises ferguss head up with his new cut hair and holds a mirror up behind his head so he can see the back
he looks like a young london stockbroker
the hair salon around them is empty
that should make her happy
who is she
fergus emerges from the shop
he takes one last look through the window where dil is taking off her smock touching up her hair etc
it is as if she has forgotten all about him
he walks off through the crowds and then ducks into a doorway
the doorway of the shop
dil comes out dressed in a pair of high heels a very short skirt different more raunchy clothes on her than we saw inside
she locks the glass door and walks down the street across the road and into a pub called the metro
half full with an after work crowd
dil makes her way through it
hi dil hiya hon
she sits down at the bar
fergus comes toward the bar and takes a seat
whatll it be
a bottle of guinness
dil looking at fergus
see that col
see what dil
he gave me a look
he buries himself in his drink
just cut his hair you know
what you think
fergus throws his eyes toward her again
she has her face turned away but sees him in the mirror
there he did it again
saw that one
what would you call it
now that was a look
she eyes fergus in the mirror
ask him to ask me what im drinking
the barman with infinite weariness approaches fergus
she wants to know do you want to know what shes drinking
fergus is about to talk when she pipes up
the barman mixes it
she stares at the mirror staring at fergus who is trying to avoid her eyes
the barman hands her the drink
now he can look
ask him does he like his hair col
she wants to know sir do you like your hair
tell her im very happy with it
hes scottish col
whatd he say col
he agreed that he was
what do you think his name is
ive no thoughts on the subject
thats what he said
hiya dil a burly man sits down beside her
he puts his hand on her knee
sing the song dil she slaps the hand away
fuck off dave
you know what i like
she turns back to fergus and finds his seat empty
fergus standing across the road from the pub
he is sweating
dil comes out of the pub
she looks this way and that as if searching for fergus
fergus stands back into a shadow
dave the burly man comes out
he grabs her by the elbow
she shrugs him off
she walks off
dave follows grabs her by the elbow again
the sense of an old argument
dave suddenly strikes her across the face with his open palm
she leans her head against a wall
dave then puts his arms around her consoles her
dave walking holding dil by the arm
the street is dilapidated full of squats
they stop outside a door
dil opens the door with a key from her purse and they both walk inside
fergus stands there observing
a light comes on in an upstairs room
dil enters we see her shadow in silhouette behind the curtain and the shadow of dave coming in behind her
he begins to remove her blouse
she stands absolutely still as he does so
fergus backs away then walks off
fergus in bed
fade to black as we see jody as a bowler running in slow motion toward the camera
he releases the ball we see fergus in bed breathing heavily
fergus takes a break and watches the batsman hit a ball
he imitates the batsmans motion with his sledgehammer
then a voice interrupts him
so pats a cricket fan eh
we see tristram deveroux a young sloane type in a three piece suit whose house it is
beside him is franknum the cockney foreman
its not pat
jim pat mick what the fuck
long as you remember youre not at lords
fergus resumes work
it is now crowded with people black white punky and street chic a lot of leather all the women are heavily made up
someone is singing from the tiny stage and rows of cheap colored bulbs are flashing around it
from the way fergus walks through it is obvious he has never been here at night
he seems most out of place in his cheap suit making his way through the crowd to the bar
fergus looks through the odd crowd but cant find dil
col the barman sees him and smiles
so can we consider you a regular sir
is that good or bad
well you get to say the usual col
things like that
col pushes a colored cocktail with one of those japanese umbrellas toward him
so lets call this the usual
fergus reaches for his wallet to pay but col interrupts
its on me
fergus tries to pretend hes familiar with the drink and by implication whatever are the norms of the place
he lifts the glass to his mouth but the umbrella keeps getting in the way
take it out if you want
fergus takes out the umbrella
he holds it in one hand and drinks with the other
you came to see her didnt you
he takes out a cigarette
a guy in leather to his left smiles at him
something i should tell you
the barman looks up toward the stage
a hand presses a button
the needle selects a disk
a song by dave berry the crying game
fergus looks up
close up of dils hand as music begins making movements to the music
we see dil standing on a stage swaying slightly
she seems a little drunk
she mimes to the song
she mouths the words so perfectly and the voice on the song is so feminine that there is no way of knowing who is doing the singing
she does all sorts of strange movements as if she is drawing moonbeams with her hands
the crowd seems to know this act
they cheer whether out of approval or derision we cant be sure
dil singing noticing him
she comes to the end of the song
the crowd cheers
fergus watching her make her way through the crowded bar toward him
hes still looking col
good thing in a man
an excellent quality
maybe he wants something
i would expect he does
ask him yourself
she looks at fergus directly sits down next to him
so tell me
fergus says nothing
everybody wants something
how old fashioned and quaint
isnt it col
you old fashioned
the burly man comes up to her
got the money dil
fuck off dave
you fucking promised
you fucking did
he suddenly jerks her roughly off the stool spilling her drink
well come on
he drags her through the crowd
in the mirror fergus watches them go
the barman eyes him
it takes all types
so whos he
hes what she should run a mile from
then why doesnt she
who knows the secrets of the human heart
fergus suddenly stands and makes his way to the door
fergus comes out
a black bouncer is there but there is no sign of dil
he walks a few yards and hears voices down an alley
he looks up it
we see dil pushing dave away
he grabs her turns her roughly
dont be like that you heard me she beats his arms away
money falls on the ground
she staggers away from him
he picks up the money then runs after her
got very fucking grand havent we he tries to pull her back
talk to me you stupid bitch they both bump into fergus who just stands there and doesnt move an inch
you forgot your bag
he holds it up to show her
who the fuck is he
its him isnt it
dave eyes fergus
fergus grabs his wrists and upends him on the ground
see they get the wrong idea
from the ground cunt
fergus puts his foot on daves neck
what was that
they all get the wrong idea
scrag eyed dyke cunt
dave grabs for her ankle
she kicks his hand away
fergus presses down his foot
he looks to dil
whatll i do
break his neck
fergus presses his foot
she bends low to dave
hes going to take his foot off slowly david
then youre to go home like a good boy
you hear me
but his voice is softer
fergus removes his foot
dil grabs his arm
come on honey
she draws him away
they walk out of the alley
you all right
yes thank you
what was that all about
he wants me to perform for him
you on the game
im a hairdresser
fergus looks back
dave is rising
hes getting up
you cant leave me then can you
fergus and dil climb slowly upstairs
you want me to ask you in right
no i didnt but im not cheap you know that
loud but never cheap
there is a movement lower down the staircase
we see dave holding his neck
fucking dumb dyke carrot cunt
dil leans close to fergus
if you kissed me it would really get his goat
she tilts up her face
fergus kisses her tenderly
now if you asked me to meet you tomorrow it would really drive him insane
she goes in and closes the door
fergus stands and looks down at dave who turns to leave
dil walks out of the salon smiling and walks toward fergus
give me that look again
the one you gave me in the metro
fergus takes a bunch of flowers from behind his back
she holds them with theatrical feeling
darling you shouldnt have
she laughs and leans toward him and kisses him in a classically old fashioned way
the girls inside the salon pull back a curtain and they all clap
whats that about
she takes his arm and walks off with him
fergus and dil looking at their menus
a waiter places drinks on their table then leaves
nows the time youre meant to do something isnt it
make a pass or something
isnt that the way it goes
they are walking in an alleyway toward her house
you got a special friend jimmy
you want one
and suddenly a car drives very fast toward them headlights on
fergus pulls her into a doorway to avoid it
the car continues down the road stops and then screeches off
the things a girl has to put up with
she looks down toward where the car has pulled away
im frightened jimmy
thats not like him
a car pulls up behind dil and fergus
piss off dave
tough guy huh
are you going to be all right on your own
im not on my own am i
she touches his cheek
come on up would you
dil comes in in the darkness
fergus stands like a shadow in the doorway
the light comes on she takes off her raincoat
wont hurt you to come in
fergus enters slowly
he looks around the room there is an exaggerated femininity about everything in it
would you like a drink
whatll it be
she goes into a small kitchen
fergus looks at the mantelpiece and sees a picture of jody
the camera tracks into the soldiers smiling face
then into ferguss face
his reverie is broken by the sound of a voice outside daves
she comes through with two drinks
someone out there
jesus fucking christ
she opens the window door and we see dave on the street in a neck brace
hey stirling fucking moss its dave
she goes back into the room and begins taking things up
talk to me dil
sure dave please dil she flings things down mens clothes leather trousers a suitcase a teddy bear
take your clothes
dont throw my clothes out the window
fuck off back to essex
fergus looks to the man down in the street a parody of rejection with his things in his arms
dont chuck my clothes out
take your fucking goldfish too
dil grabs a large goldfish bowl and flings it down
the bowl breaks to bits on the pavement
goldfish thrash around in the street
you fucking bitch
he tries to pick up the flapping fish in his hands
upstairs dil closes the window shut
howd he drive with his neck in a brace
must be in love to manage that
doesnt know the meaning of the word
fergus stands as dil hands him a glass
he lived here with you
sit down will you
fergus walks past the photograph and sits down
he looks from her to the picture
what about him
he nods toward the picture
she looks down into her drink
he was different
as different as its possible to be
tell me about him
shouldnt i go
and they fall into one anothers arms
she stretches up with her whole body over him
they grow suddenly and violently passionate
they fall into the cushions of the couch onto the floor
the photograph above them seems to smile
he draws up her dress with his hands
she suddenly pulls away
no did you do that to him
she comes up toward him once more
she puts her mouth close to his ear
you want to know how i kissed him
are you jealous of him
she opens the buttons on his shirt and her mouth travels down his chest
fergus tries to draw her up toward him but her hand reaches up to his mouth and presses his head back while her other hand undoes his pants
she kisses his stomach her mouth moves down his body
fergus stares at the picture of jody
jodys eyes seem to burn through him
dil raises her head and kisses his mouth
there are tears in his eyes
what would he think
he was a soldier
went there like a fool
she sits in front of the mirror
do you miss him
what do you think
i think you do
dreamily you say that like a gentleman
like youre concerned
fergus gets up and stands behind her gently pushes the hair from her face
but you can t stay you know that
didnt think i could
a real gentleman
she embraces him
shouldnt you be in mourning
she sits back down in front of the mirror
she reapplies her lipstick
singer in a blue dress
dil and fergus by the bar
both drinking drinks with umbrellas
dave comes up behind them with his neck brace
look im sorry
fuck off dave
no i wont fucking fuck off
said im sorry didnt i
you hear jimmy
dave steps two feet back
i was only going to ask her for a dance
fergus takes dils arm
the woman is singing
as they circle people begin to look at them admiringly
dil holds her cheek close to his
did he come here too
is this an obsession of yours
he did sometimes
did he dance with you
dil doesnt answer
looks at him out of the corner of her eye
so what do you want with me jimmy
want to look after you
what does that mean
something i heard someone say once
she draws back and looks at him
you mean that
she dances closer
if i told you you wouldnt believe me
in the bar people singing along with the music
dave sitting at the bar sulking
youre not having me on are you
cause dil cant stand that
she puts her cheek against his
dave at the bar slams his drink down
and she does get very upset
dave stands up to leave
on the stage the act finishes
dil draws fergus back to the bar
col the barman pours her drink
one for him too
col pours and smiles
what is this
she throws it back in one
cant leave me now
the thing is can you go the distance
depends what it is
no depends on nothing
she takes the bottle herself and fills their glasses
she slams it back
she tilts his glass back
he swallows it in one
she enters fergus walks in slowly
he looks from the cricket whites that are hanging up behind a curtain to the photographs
what you thinking of hon
im thinking of your man
im wondering why you keep his things
told you im superstitious
she turns toward him and undoes her hair
it falls around her shoulders
did he ever tell you you were beautiful
all the time
fergus runs his hand down her throat
he looks after me
hes a gentleman too
she draws him behind a curtain toward the bed pulls him down
they kiss passionately
give me one minute
she walks into the bathroom
fergus lies there looking at the picture listening to the sound of running water
she comes out then dressed in a silk kimono
she looks extraordinarily beautiful
he reaches out his hand and grasps hers
he draws her toward him
he begins to kiss her face and neck
would he have minded
she murmurs no
his hands slip the wrap down from her shoulders
close on his hands traveling down her neck in the darkness
then the hands stop
the kimono falls to the floor gently with a whisper
the camera travels with it and we see in a close up that she is a man
fergus sits there frozen staring at her
you did know didnt you
fergus says nothing
oh my god
she gives a strange little laugh then reaches out to touch him
fergus smacks the hand away
i feel sick he gets up and runs to the bathroom
she grabs his feet
dont go jimmy he kicks her away
he runs into the bathroom and vomits into the tub
she crouches on the floor
i thought you knew
he retches again
what were you doing in the bar if you didnt know im bleeding
she lights a cigarette
fergus runs the taps
he washes his face rinses his mouth
its all right jimmy
i can take it
just not on the face
fergus slams the door shut
she is sitting on the couch the kimono round her once more looking very much like a woman
a trace of blood on her mouth
ysee im not a young thing any longer
funny the way things go
dont you find that jimmy
never the way you expected
fergus comes out of the bathroom
she looks up
some hope in her face
you mean that
and he makes to go
she grabs him to stop him
dont go like that
he pulls away from her
she falls to the floor
he drags himself away and runs down the stairs
fergus in bed
flash to shot of blackness jody grinning in cricket whites throwing the ball up and down in his hand
the place is hopping
he now sees it as he should have seen it the first night as a transvestite bar
he makes his way through the crowds
all the women too heavily made up
some beautifully sleek young things he looks at he realizes are young men
he makes his way to the bar where dil is sitting nursing a drink with an umbrella in it
her face is bruised
she is wearing dark glasses
as he walks toward her she sees him in the mirror
she talks to col the barman
hes back col hi
dont want any of those looks col
they dont mean much
stop it dil no
tell him to go fuck himself
col turns to him
she wants me to tell you go fuck yourself
there is a tear running down her cheek under the dark glasses
tell him to stop messing dil around dil tell him it hurt i have to talk to her col says hes got to talk to you fergus touches her arm
come on dil where
she whips her arm away
tell him again col
go fuck himself she walks into the crowd toward the door
fergus walking outside dils place
the blinds in her room are down and the light is on inside
we see her outline pacing up and down behind the blinds smoking a cigarette
we hear the song the crying game
fergus stands beneath her doorway scribbles a note and sticks it in the letter box
a man removes a large number six from a huge scoreboard with a pole and replaces it with a number nine
below the scoreboard we can see dil walking across a lawn toward the building where fergus is working
fergus fitting a new window into the finished wall
on the pitch we see the cricketers distorted through the moving glass of the window
across the pitch dil walks with a lunch basket in her hand dressed in a very short skirt with high heels
as she approaches the site a chorus of whistles breaks out
fergus hearing the whistling stares out
he sees dil moving toward the site
he drops the window and the glass shatters
as the whistles continue we see dil in the sites lift which rises up
we see deveroux and franknum climbing up a ladder toward fergus
how much did that frame cost mr
two hundred quid mr
your pat just cost me two hundred quid
sorry wont bring the bloody thing back will it mr
not in my experience
off his wages
do you mean that
he wants to know do i mean that
im sure you do mr
bloody right i do
through this conversation fergus can hear the chorus of wolf whistles increasing
he looks out the gap where the window should be and sees dil in the lift
the laborers whistle at her looking up her skirt etc
she passes by a gap in the wall and blows a kiss at him
is that his tart
does pat have a tart
shes not a tart
no of course not shes a lady
shes not that either
fergus walks out of the room
fergus walks round the scaffolding
dil sees him and waves sits on some bricks and opens the hamper
darling she is acting bright and businesslike like any wife
she is wearing dark glasses to cover the bruise on her face
she pecks him on the cheek
never let the sun go down on an argument jody used to say
what you doing here
got your note
so lets kiss and make up hon
dont call me that
give it over dil apologies my sweet
fergus smiles in spite of himself
thats more like it dear
have a cuppa
she takes out a thermos and pours him some tea
youre something else dil you know that
never said a truer word
she hands him a neatly cut sandwich
see i was always best looking after someone
must be something in the genes
and the fact that you didnt know is basically the fault of yours truly
and even when you were throwing up i could tell you cared
do you care jimmy
sure i do
you mean that
i care dil
she lowers her head
you crying dil
he removes her glasses and looks at her moist eyes
im tired and emotional
then he hears a voice behind him
do it on your own time paddy
whatever it is she does for you
fergus looks from dil to deveroux
if i was her id consider that an insult
consider it how you like
just get that bloody tart out of here
fergus stands up suddenly
he speaks quietly
did you ever pick your teeth up with broken fingers
deveroux stares suddenly chilled
whats that supposed to mean
its a simple question
deveroux says nothing
fergus looks down to dil
come on dear
he holds out his arm
dil gathers up her things and takes it
her face is wreathed in a smile
he didnt answer honey fergus walks her down the scaffolding ramp
sorry about that mr
dil and fergus descend from the site in the lift
my oh my jimmy how gallant
made me feel all funny inside
i said stop it
ask me to meet you again jimmy
you think thats wise
the lift stops with a thud
i didnt mean to hit you
i know that
kind of liked you as a girl
thats a start
so im sorry
make it up to me then
ask to meet me again
will you meet me again
she leans forward and kisses him
fergus hears a wail of catcalls behind him
he watches dil go as the lift takes him back up to the site
fergus outside the hair salon
dil inside is throwing off her smock and walking toward him
all the girls are smiling
fergus looks from dil to the girls as they approach
do they know
know what honey
know what i didnt know
and dont call me that
cant help it jimmy
a girl has her feelings
thing is dil youre not a girl
details baby details
so they do know
all right they do
she takes his arm as they walk off
i should have known shouldnt i
kind of wish i didnt
you can always pretend
your soldier knew didnt he
wont be quite the same though will it
are you pretending yet
im working on it
fergus hears a car following them and turns around to look
he knew too
stop it jimmy
am i becoming repetitious
they reach her door
the car stops
dont ask me in
cant pretend that much
i miss you jimmy
should have stayed a girl
dont be cruel
be a good girl and go inside
only if you kiss me
fergus kisses her
he looks at her open lips as if in disbelief at himself
she goes inside
fergus walks into the room and turns on a small desk light
then he hears a voice
he sees jude sitting in the corner
her hair is now dark brown
he stares at her says nothing
what was it fergus
did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up
leave me alone jude
thats the last thing ill do
you never asked what happened
eddie and tinker died
maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth
no thanks to you
what you think of the hair
she walks round the room
aye i was sick of being blond
needed a tougher look if you know what i mean
she lies down on the bed beside him takes off a black leather glove and puts her hand on his crotch
fuck me fergus
he takes her hand away
am i to take it thats a no
he says nothing
we had a court martial in your absence
they wanted to put a bullet in your head
i pleaded for clemency
said we should find out what happened first
so what did happen
i couldnt shoot him in the back
i tried to catch him
he made it to the road and got hit by a saracen
so you did fuck up
but you know what the thing is fergus
no what is the thing
you vanished quite effectively
became mister nobody
and youve no idea how useful that could be
what do you mean
weve got some plans here
and well need a mister nobody to execute them
no way jude
youre never out fergus
she looks at him hard
he looks away
maybe you dont care whether you die or not
but consider the girl fergus
the wee black chick
he leaps up from the bed
leave her out of this
jesus fergus youre a walking cliche
you know we wont leave her out of this
but im glad to see you care
she brings her lips close to his so they touch
and i must admit im curious
he grabs her hair and pulls her head back
what the fuck do you know jude
she pulls a gun and sticks it between his teeth
you fucking tell me boy fergus stares at her
then says quietly shes nobody
she likes me
so i suppose a fuck is out of the question
keep your head down fergus
no sudden moves
and not a whisper to her
youll be hearing from us
she kisses him briefly with the gun at his temple
keep the faith
fergus stands in the darkness
fergus walking toward the hair salon flowers in his hand
he stands outside watching the flowers behind his back
then the chair turns and we see it is jude
he sees jude looking at him smiling brightly then talking back to dil
he your boyfriend
jude turning in the chair
hed bring me carnations
so i got it wrong then
not at all honey
she smiles brightly at something behind fergus
he turns and sees jude is there
fergus stands suddenly
he throws some money on the table grabs her arm and frog marches her out
why honey come on
you gonna tell me why
as they pass jude she smiles
outside the restaurant
fergus marches dil away
whats wrong jimmy
tell me whats wrong not here
they pass out of shot
in the background we see jude rising
dil and fergus making their way to their seats at the bar
you gonna tell me what it is
a figure sitting down at the bar
it is jude
what was it
you know her jimmy
jimmy is it
do you know me jimmy
dil this is jude

ever so nice
arent you jimmy
young love as they say
the younger the better
doesnt come your way much i suppose

well maybe youll get lucky
a bit heavy on the powder isnt she jimmy
a girl has to have a bit of glamour
long as she can keep it
isnt that right james
dil watches her go
its her isnt it
shes the thing you had to tell me
im sorry you know that
im really sorry
she looks at col you see that col
saw it dil
fuck it is what i say
fuck it dil
fucking men col
there are tears in her eyes
and fuck you jimmy she staggers out of the pub
fergus sits there
there is an expression in cols eyes that makes fergus feel very very small
you could always make it up to her
when a girl runs out like that she generally wants to be followed
shes not a girl col whatever you say
but fergus rises and walks out
a figure standing down the alleyway smoking
fergus looks toward it but jude is standing there waiting
she went that way jude grabs his arm
but you come with me
she draws him down an alley where the same car is waiting
they get inside
dil sitting inside a taxi watching fergus and jude getting in the car
in the moving car
jude is driving maguire next to her
fergus sits in the back
so it was you all the time
whod you think it was
i thought it was dave
and whos dave when hes at home
hes at home
should blow you away you know that
i know that
maguire stubs his cigarette out on ferguss hand then whacks him on the teeth with his closed fist
im getting emotional
and i dont want to get fucking emotional you understand hennessy
fuck you too jude drives
fergus looks through the back window at the street outside
leave him alone peter
hes in love
that true fergus
you in love
and whats she like between the sheets
and who is she
just a girl
and you know whatll happen if you fuck up again dont you
aye i do peter
the car draws to a halt in a sedate square
several doors down is the entrance to what looks like a sedate conservative club
in the car maguire turns off the engine
he nods toward the building
so what do you think that is hennessy
its a knocking shop
tres discreet huh
he visits his ladies on tuesday and thursday nights and saturday mornings
his securitys in the car beyond
he nods toward a car a daimler parked some distance away
fergus looks from the window to the car
who is he
doesnt matter who he is
he is what we would call a legitimate target
thank god for that
you being cynical hennessy
so what do you think
whoever hits himll be hit if those men are any good
and i presume you cant get in
so its on the street
kind of suicide isnt it
jude turns around to look at him
but then i dont have a choice
och you do fergie
come on fergie
jude and fergus get out of the car
they walk down the street down from the brothel cum club where there is a cafe bar with some tables outside
fergus and jude crossing the street
you keep your mind on the job boy
and then youll leave her out of it
then well leave her be
they take their seats by the tables
we can see the brothel down the way
takes him two minutes to get to the door
she checks her watch
fergus is sweating
and what if i say no
you know what
down by the brothel the door swings open
fergus walks like any pedestrian down toward the brothel
there is an old portly gent in a city suit emerging from it
the car by the pavement kicks into action and the door opens
fergus quickens his pace
jude by the cafe watches
the gent makes his way with gout ridden slowness across the pavement through the passersby toward the car
a burly security man emerging from the car walking toward the old gent
fergus reaches the car just before he does and passes between him and the open door
the old gents stomach brushes ferguss elbow
pardon me young man fergus walks on
jude from the cafe watches fergus walking on the old man being eased with painstaking care inside the daimler
then the door closing and the daimler pulling off
when the daimler has passed fergus he turns around and walks back
jude smiles and leaps up as he approaches
you were made for this
and what happens then
well be on the other side
well move when you do
and what if you dont
fergus i think you dont trust me
you may be right
stay late at your work tomorrow night and ill bring you the gear
jude begins to walk away
whos the old geezer
she walks off crosses the road to maguire in the car
fergus turns around to see dil in front of the cafe
she goes inside he follows
whyd you follow me dil
was jealous jimmy
she downs a drink and motions for another
she seems high
shouldnt be dil why shouldnt i be jealous
there are tears streaming down her face
he takes his hand and begins to wipe her face
she sits down he joins her
she own you jimmy
she from scotland too
you could say that
and youre not going to tell me more
he wipes the tears from her face with a tissue then dabs the tissue in her drink and wipes some more
what you doing jimmy
im not sure
do you like me even a little bit
more than that
dils face staring at him
come on lets go for a walk
she allows herself to be led out
dil and fergus walking
fergus stops her by the window
you do something for me dil
youd do anything for me
you got the keys to the shop
they walk inside
dil and fergus standing in the darkness
you want another haircut baby
he sits her down in one of the chairs
youd do anything for me
fergus takes up a scissors to snip at her hair
her head leaps back
you said anything dil a girl has to draw the line somewhere want to change you to a man dil
she stares at him
its a secret
youd like me better that way jimmy
and you wouldnt leave me
she takes a breath
go on then
fergus begins to cut
close up on dlls face as her hair is shorn
tears stream down her cheeks
youre no good at this jimmy
but he keeps cutting
he gives dil a short cropped military cut like jodys
you want to make me look like him
want to make you into something new
that nobody recognizes
she looks in the mirror at it in the dark
dont recognize myself jimmy
dil enters with her new haircut
she goes to turn on the light
he stops her hand
she looks at her hand on his
better in the dark
her fingers close around his
so its true then
you like me better like this
she brings her lips to his neck
he lets them stay there
his hands travel up to her blouse
he begins to undo the buttons
oh jimmy slowly the blouse slips down exposing her male torso
she falls down to her knees and tugs at his belt
he raises her to her feet and leads her toward the bed
she stretches languorously down on it
he unzips her skirt slowly and draws it off
she turns on the bed sexily her face to the mattress
she is wearing suspender belts underneath her skirt
but fergus stands and walks quietly over to the wardrobe where the soldiers things are
dil on the bed slowly turns
what are you doing honey
we see fergus from her point of view coming toward her with jodys white cricket shirt glowing eerily in the dark
dont call me that sorry
what you doing
fergus draws her slowly up to a standing position
try this on dil he wraps the shirt around her
she kisses him
fergus leading dil dressed in jodys cricket clothes down the street and inside
why are we going here jimmy
look on it like a honeymoon
from above we see the figures of fergus and dil sleeping on a double bed both fully clothed
fergus smokes then puts out the cigarette
the light gradually fills the room
looks at the bedside clock and very gingerly rises puts on his coat and walks out
a car pulls up at the site
jude gets out
she has a satchel in her hand
fergus looking down a ladder staircase at jude
you a handyman fergie
i take pride in my work
i sincerely hope so
fergus climbs down a ladder to jude she hands him something from the bag
tools of the trade
she kisses him
fergus looks at her expressionlessly
and forget about the girl
fergus opens what jude has given him looking inside
there is a gun wrapped in an oilcloth
the room is empty
he runs outside
fergus looks up at her building but the lights are off in her flat
the sound of feet behind him
he turns and sees dil walking toward him a bottle in her hand
he runs toward her
what the fuck are you doing here
im going home
told you to stay in the hotel
thought you was fooling me
thought you was leaving me
they are tussling in the darkness of the park
she is very drunk
i had to go to work
stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you
theres something youre not telling me jimmy
he takes her arm
im going home
fergus and dil on the stairs up to dils flat
so tell me
i was trying to get out of something
tell me everything jimmy
fergus looks at her
you got to forget you ever saw me dil
you mean that
and she suddenly faints into his arms
as if on cue
stop it would you
there is no response
he shakes her
give it over dil for fucks sake still no response
he grows alarmed
he slaps her cheek
she opens her eyes slowly
i get nervous
i got this blood condition
just help me inside jimmy then ill be all right
he walks in holding her
leans her against the wall then goes to the window to check the street outside
she takes a large slug from a bottle of whiskey
you heard what i said dil
she points weakly to a cabinet through the open door of the bathroom
for my condition
he goes and gets the pills
she takes a handful of pills
she drinks from the whiskey bottle
are you supposed to take that many
only in times of extreme stress
she walks around the room drinking then sits down
see they all say good bye sometime
cept for him
she looks at the picture of jody
then she looks at fergus
are you all right dil
i will be
she stares straight ahead the bottle clutched in her hands between her knees
go on then
fergus walks slowly toward the door
good bye dil jimmy
dont go like that
she looks at him standing up
something incredibly attractive about her
cant help what i am
he walks slowly toward her
he kisses her on the lips
we see the photograph with the soldiers smiling face
fergus looks from it to her
she seems to be in a sweet narcotic haze
she reaches out her hand and strokes his
knew you had a heart
fergus sits down on the bed
dil is lying back on it
dil can i tell you something
i knew your man
you knew which man
you knew my jody
she still strokes his hand
her voice is dreamily slurred her eyes far away
lifted him from a carnival in belfast
held him hostage for three days
you knew my jody
are you listening
dil smiles woozily
i got the order to shoot him
before i could do it he ran
ran into a tank and died
did you hear me
you killed my jody
in a manner of speaking
it was you
she is not rational
she is smiling far away somewhere
you should scream
you should beat my head off
she woozily tries to hit him round the face
you killed my jody no
i suppose i tried
dont you want to kill me
dil raises an unsteady hand and points it at him
he strokes her cheek
she says very slowly and sleepily dont leave me tonight
might kill me too
her eyes close
she falls into a deep sleep
fergus looks down at her almost fondly
they are lying on the bed together fully clothed
she rises very quietly and goes to his coat thrown across a chair
she searches through the pockets and takes out the gun
jude in bed
an alarm sounds she reaches to turn it off
dil takes several silk stockings out of a drawer and ties them very securely to each corner of the brass bed
she ties them round both of ferguss feet very gently so as not to wake him
jude in front of a mirror getting ready
she draws one of ferguss hands up very gingerly and ties that securely to the upright
she ties the other and is drawing it upward when he wakes
she jerks the silk stocking so it is secure
what the fuck dil speaks unnaturally quietly
so tell me what youre doing jimmy
jude fully dressed
she takes a gun from under the bed and slips it in her handbag
dil crouching beside fergus his gun in her hand
didnt really listen last night
i heard but i didnt listen
fergus staring at her
he tries to pull on the bindings
that wont do you no good
dil knows how to tie a body
she stands up still pointing the gun at fergus
wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look
he asked me to see were you all right
jude on the street
maguires car pulls up rapidly and she gets inside
see i fix on anyone thats nice to me
just the littlest bit nice and im yours
stop it dil just dont kick dil and shell be touched
be nice to her and shell be yours forever
she looks at him tears in her eyes
see i should blow you away jimmy
but i cant do that
let me go dil he drags at his bindings
got to be somewhere
try and go then
the figure of the judge in the window
outline of a woman
jude and maguire are in the car parked across the street
they look toward a paper seller
where the fuck is he
christ fergus pulls furiously at his bindings
let me go for fucks sake dil or theyll be here let them come then
cant stay here peter drive around once more he drives off
fergus collapsed back on the bed exhausted
just want your company for a little while longer
maguires car driving round once more
no sign of fergus
that fuckers dead no we are
fergus strains and roars from the bed
you dont know what youre doing dil
maguires point of view the brothel door opening
the elderly judge comes out
the car with his security men guns up
give me the shooter jude youre crazy give me the fucking shooter
he grabs it from her pocket
throws open the door and runs across the street
jude dives into the drivers seat
fergus pulling at his bindings
the judge walking toward the open door of the car held open by his goon
maguire running toward him gun in hand
the goon sees him
maguire shoots as he runs
once twice three times four
the judge falls
the goon hit in the arm pulls an uzi and returns fire
maguire hit still shooting
other goons tear from the car
jude hits the pedal on her car and screeches off
dil dressed in the soldiers cricket clothes
she looks like a sweet little boy
she places a cassette in the tape deck the crying game song
she comes to the bed and points the gun at ferguss head
you like me now jimmy
i like you dil give me a bit more baby a bit more
i like you dil love me
tell me you love me
whatever you say dil
then say it
love you dil
what would you do for me
she begins to cry and lays the gun gently on his chest
say it again
id do anything for you dil
she pulls on his bindings to release him
two police cars sirens wailing
dils face close to ferguss as the stockings that bound his hands are nearly undone
and youll never leave me
i know youre lying jimmy but its nice to hear it
his arm is free
he strokes her hair
im sorry dil
she shudders with weeping
the music of the song plays in the background
jude walking through the open door arms extended holding a gun
you stupid shit once was bad enough
dil rises from the bed and points her gun at jude
you didnt knock honey dil fires hits jude
jude falls and is writhing on the floor
get that thing off me fergus dil walks closer holding the gun and pointing it at jude
what was that she called you jimmy
its my name dil what happened to jimmy
i said get it off me fergus jude on the floor reaches for her gun
manages to grab it
whats she going to do jimmy
she going to blow you away
dil shoots again like a child playing with a toy
she hits jude in her gun shoulder
jude spins one way the gun the other
was she there too
when you got my jody
fergus screams dil
i asked you a question honey were you there too you sick bitch as she raises the gun dil shoots her repeatedly saying you was there wasnt you
you used those tits and that ass to get him didnt you
fergus screams from the bed
he rips free his other arm
dil shoots jude in the throat and she falls dead covered in blood
dil turns the gun on fergus
she was there wasnt she
she was and she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him didnt she
tell me what she wore
dil points the gun at him squeezing on the trigger
then she stops
cant do it jimmy
he wont let me
she looks at the picture walks over and sits down in front of it
you wont let me jody she raises the gun and places it in her mouth
fergus takes it gently from her mouth and places it on the table
he lifts her up by the shoulders
youve got to go now dil do i
am i in trouble jimmy
not if you go
will i see you again
you will dil
where am i to go jimmy
meet col yes
say hello to col he leads her out the door
fergus goes back into the room past judes body
looks out the window to where he can see dil staggering down the street through the crowds that have gathered
the wail of police sirens coming closer
he watches dil run off with her funny walk
then looks down and sees the cop cars pushing through the knot of people around the house
he picks up the gun wipes it with a rag to remove dils fingerprints
he turns to the picture of the soldier talks to it
you should have stayed at home
he sits in the chair by the window waiting
fade up to reveal a large interior with light streaming in the windows
large barred doors open and a group of women come through with parcels children in tow etc
among them is dil looking resplendent
she walks past the rows of convicts with their families up to a glass cage where fergus sits waiting
got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets hon dont call me that
now the white ones are magnesium supplement stop it dil ive got to keep you healthy jimmy
im counting the days
two thousand three hundred and thirty four left
im sorry darling
i keep forgetting the leap year

fergus my love light of my life please dil cant help it
youre doing time for me
no greater love as the man says
wish youd tell me why
as the man said its in my nature
whats that supposed to mean
she shakes her head
well there was this scorpion you see
and he wants to go across the river
but he cant swim
so he goes to this frog who can swim and he says to him excuse me mr
camera pulls back and as fergus tells the story of the scorpion and the frog the music comes up stand by your man
