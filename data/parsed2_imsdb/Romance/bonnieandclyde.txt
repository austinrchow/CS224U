by david newman robert benton blonde somewhat fragile intelligent in expression
she is putting on make up with intense concentration and appreciation applying lipstick and eye make up
as the camera slowly pulls back from the closeup we see that we have been looking into a mirror
she is standing before the full length mirror in her bedroom doing her make up
she overdoes it in the style of the time rosebud mouth and so forth
as the film progresses her make up will be refined until at the end there is none
the camera pulls back and continues to move very slowly throughout the first part of this scene
as the camera continues to move away we see by degrees that bonnie is naked
her nudity is never blatantly revealed to the audience but implied
that is she should be covered in various ways from the cameras p
but the audience must be aware of her exposure to clyde later in the scene
this is the only time in the film that she will ever be this exposed in all senses of the word to the audience
her attitude and appraisal of herself here are touched with narcissism
the bedroom itself is a second story bedroom in a lower class frame house in west dallas texas
the neighborhood is low income
though the room reveals its shabby surroundings it also reveals an attempt by bonnie to fix it up
small and corny objets dart are all over the tops of the bureaus vanity tables etc
little glass figurines and porcelain statuettes and the like
bonnie finishes admiring herself
she walks from the mirror and moves slowly across the room the camera moving with her until she reaches the screened window on the opposite wall
the shade is up
there are no curtains
she looks out the window looking down and the camera looks down with her
over her shoulder we see the driveway leading to the garage connected to the house
there is an old car parked in the driveway its windows open
we see a man walking up the driveway somewhat furtively
he is a rather dapper fellow dressed in a dark suit with a vest a white collar and a straw boater
it is clyde barrow
obviously he is about to steal the car
he looks it over checking around him to make sure no passers by are coming
he peers inside the front window to see if the keys are in the ignition
he studies the dashboard
bonnie continues watching silently
finally she calls out
what you doin with my mamas car
clyde startled jumps and looks to see who has caught him
obviously frightened he looks up and his face freezes at what he sees
we now see what he is looking at at the open window revealed from the waist up is the naked bonnie
she looks down an impudent half smile on her face
she doesnt move or make any attempt to cover herself
whose face changes from astonishment to an answering smile of impudence
seeing what he has he realizes that this girl is clearly not going to scream for the police
already they are in a little game instigated by bonnie sizing each other up competing in a kind of playful arrogance
before they speak they have become coconspirators
close up of bonnie still smiling
finally she speaks
running from the window she flings open a closet and grabs a dress and shoes
she slips on the shoes and flings the dress on running out the door as she does
the camera tracks with her moving as fast
as she runs down the stairs she buttons up the dress
she flies out the door slamming it behind her runs off the porch all this has been one continuous movement since she left the window in great haste and continues
quickly into the driveway
four feet away from clyde she stops on a dime
they stand there looking at each other smiling the same challenge
for a few seconds no one speaks then putting her on aint you ashamed
tryin to steal an old ladys automobile
with the same put on i been thinkin about buyin me one
you aint got money for dinner let alone buy no car
still the battle of wits going on now i got enough money for cokes and since it dont look like youre gonna invite me inside youd steal the dining room
table if i did
he moves from his spot come to town with me then
howd that be
starting to walk onto the sidewalk goin to work anyway
the camera tracks
it is a hot texas afternoon all white light and glare
as they walk the block to town in this scene their manner of mutual impudence is still pervading
goin to work huh
what do you do
none of your business
pretending to give it serious thought i bet youre a
a lady mechanic
really offended by that what do you think i am
right on the nose a waitress
slightly startled by his accuracy anxious to get back now that he is temporarily one up what line of work are you in
when youre not stealin cars
mysteriously i tell you im lookin for suitable employment right at the moment
what did you do before
coolly knowing its effect i was in state prison
she shows her surprise yeah
herself again guess some little old lady wasnt so nice
tough it was armed robbery
sarcastically my my the things that turn up in the driveway these days
they reach the corner and turn
they are on a small town street of barber shops cafes groceries etc
at the moment it is deserted
they continue walking down the empty street
clyde looks the place over
what do yall do for a good time around here listen to the grass grow
guess you had a lot more fun up at state prison huh
clyde laughs enjoying her repartee
they continue walking
at a hydrant clyde stops
showing off but seriously see this foot
pointing at his right foot i chopped two toes off of it
with an axe
to get off the damn work detail thats why
stopping want to see
a lady of some sensitivity no
turning a cute i surely dont intend to stand here and look at your dirty feet in the middle of main street
they continue walking in silence past a few stores each planning what next to say
boy did you really do that
you must be crazy
gas station up the block
bonnie and clyde are seen leaning against the soft drink chest their profiles silhouetted by the bright sun
they are drinking cokes
as they begin to talk the camera moves in closer to them
clyde takes off his hat and rubs the cold coke bottle across his forehead
bonnie watches him
whats it like
very interested no armed robbery
he thinks it a silly question its
i dont know
it isnt like anything
thinking shes heard proof that hes a liar hah
i knew you never robbed bo place you faker
challenged oh yeah
studies her then makes up his mind to show her close up
he reaches in his jacket and pulls out a gun
the camera moves to a closeup of the gun glinting in the sunlight
the camera pulls back to show bonnie looking at it with fascination
the weapon has an immediate effect on her
she touches it in a manner almost sexual full of repressed excitement
goading him on yeah well you got one all right i guess
but you wouldnt have the gumption to use it
picking up the challenge proving himself you just keep your eyes open
the camera remains just behind bonnies shoulder so that throughout the following scene we have bonnie in the picture looking at what we look at
clyde goes into the little store
we remain outside with bonnie watching
for a minute nothing happens
we can barely see what is going on in the store
then clyde comes out walking slowly
in one hand he holds the gun in the other a fistful of money
he gets halfway to bonnie and smiles broadly at her a smile of charm and personality
she smiles back
the moment is intense as if a spark has jumped from one to the other
their relationship which began the minute bonnie spotted him in the driveway has now really begun
clyde has shown his stuff and bonnie is turned on
suddenly the old man who runs the grocery store comes running out into the street completely dumbfounded
he stands there and says nothing yet his mouth moves in silent protest
clyde points the gun above him and fires
it is the first loud noise in the film thus far and it should be a shock
the old man terrified runs back into the store as fast as he can clyde quickly grabs bonnies hand
the camera swings with them as they turn and begin to run down the street
a few yards and the stores disappear entirely
the landscape turns into that arid flat and unrelieved western plain that begins where the town ends
a car is parked at the back of the store
as soon as they reach it clyde motions and bonnie gets in
clyde runs to the front lifts up the hood and crosses the wires to make it start
as he stands back bonnie calls to him hey whats your name anyway
he slams the hood clyde barrow
he runs over to the door opens it shoves her over and starts up the engine
the entire sequence is played at an incredible rapid pace
loud to make herself heard over the gunning motor hi im bonnie parker
please to meet you
the car zooms off down the road doing
the fast country breakdown music starts up on the sound track going just as fast as the car
the car still speeding further down the road
we zoom down and look in the rear window
clyde is driving we see from behind
bonnie is all over him biting his ear ruffling his hair running her hands all over him in short making passionate love to him while he drives
the thrill of the robbery and the escape has turned her on sexually
the camera pulls back and above the car
the car starts to go crazy in a comical fashion manifesting to the audience just what is happening to the driver controlling it
the car swerves all over the road
the car comes to a sudden halt
the car starts again
it swerves this time almost right off the road before it straightens out
it jumps and jerks
another car comes down the road the other way and clydes car swerves so much as to make the other guy drive right off the road into the dirt
it is almost mack sennett stuff but not quite that much
bonnie grabs the wheel and turns it sharply
it hairpins off the road onto a shoulder beneath some trees
still settling to a stop
bonnie and clyde appear to be necking heavily now punctuated by bonnies squeals of passion as she squirms and hops about like a flea trying to get to clyde
the floor gear shift is keeping their bodies apart however
in exasperation bonnie takes the gear shift and shoves it forward out of their way
she plunges onto clyde burying him from view
kissing biting you ready
muffled laughing hey wait
giggling herself arent you ready
well get ready
bonnie has obviously touched him
with savage coquetry she tears into her clothes and his
muffled cmon honey cmon boy
hey wait a minute
quit that now cut it out
sharply i said cut it out
he shoves her rudely away slamming her into the far car door
suddenly it looks as if theyve been fighting
both unbuttoned and unglued they stare silently at one another breathing heavily
clyde gets out of the car clearly shaken
despite the fact that he may have encountered this situation many times before its one that no twenty one year old boy in is sophisticated enough to dismiss easily with
bonnie remains seated in the car
she seems terribly vulnerable
she fumbles about for a cigarette too confused to figure out what didnt happen
clyde turns back and reaches through the car window from the drivers side lighting it for her
bonnie casts clyde a fishy stare then accepts the light
trying to be casual even insouciant look i dont do that
its not that i cant his voice cracks the match burns his fingers and he bangs his head onto roof of car and he goes right on its just that
i dont see no percentage in it
i mean theres nothin wrong with me i dont like boys
bonnie doesnt know what she thinks and clyde is trying to gauge her reaction whether she feels rejected or repelled
in fact its both along with a little latent fascination
finally spitting out smoke boy
a little annoyed boy what
your advertising is dandy
folksd just never guess you dont have a thing to sell
a little afraid you better take me home now
getting back into car wait
dont touch me
she gets out of car leaving clyde draped across the front seat reaching after her
almost shouting if all you wants stud service then get on back to west dallas and stay there the rest of your life
this stops her
now clyde pours it on with an almost maniacal exuberance that becomes more controlled as he gets control of bonnie
but youre worth moren that a lot more and you know it and thats why you come along with me
you could find a lover boy on every corner in town and it doesnt make a damn to them whether youre waiting on tables or picking cotton so long as
but it does make a damn to me
turning intrigued why
because youre different
youre like me and you want different things
bonnie is hooked now
continuing you and me travelin together we could cut clean acrost this state and kansas too and maybe dip into oklahoma and missouri or whatnot and catch ourselves highpockets and
a highheeled ol time
we can be somethin we could never be alone
ill show you
when we walk into the adolphus hotel in san antone you wearin a silk dress theyll be waitin on you and believe me sugar theyre gonna know your last name
he stops having begun to woo her to something more intense than a casual physical coupling
whend you figure that all out
first time i saw you
intensely with real honesty cause you may be the best damn girl in texas
who are you anyway
bonnie and clyde seated in booth now c
the sound track bridges the scene the question that bonnie has just asked is now suddenly rebutted by clyde as he points a finger at her
not answering her preferring to lead the conversation ill tell you about you
he loves doing this and he does it well
the more he envisions bonnies life the more instinctively accurate he becomes
she grows more and more fascinated like a child watching a mind reader
you were born somewheres around east texas
got a big old family right
you went to school of course but you didnt take to it much cause you was a lot smarter than everybody else anyway
so you just quit
thinking playing it for all its worth when you were sixteen
no seventeen there was a guy who worked in
pull back taking in bonnie favoring clyde
fascinated cement plant right
and you liked him cause he thought you was just as nice as you could be
you almost married that guy but then
you thought no you didnt think you would
so you got your job in the cafe
getting closer to home now hitting them right in there and every morning you wake up and you hate it
you just hate it
and you get down there and you put on your white uniform
and the truck drivers come in to eat greasy burgers and they kid you and you kid them back but theyre stupid and dumb boys with big tattoos all over
em and you dont like it
and they ask you for dates and sometimes you go
but you mostly dont and all they ever try is to get into your pants whether you want to or not
and you go home and sit in your room and think when and how will i ever get away from this
and now you know
bonnie is half mesmerized by his talk
a waitress comes with their food
a cheap gaudy dame she has spit curls on each temple in the style of the times
clyde looks at her and at bonnie who also wears spit curls
as soon as the waitress leaves pointing at her hair change that
i dont like it
without a word of protest bonnie immediately reaches in her bag and takes out a mirror
she holds it up and with the other hand brushes back her spit curls into her hair
she never again wears them
when she has pushed them back she looks at clyde for his approval
he nods his okay
she smiles puts back her mirror and begins to eat her food
shes ravenously hungry and eats with total concentration on her plate
clyde doesnt touch his food just watches bonnie eat for a minute
god youre a knockout
clyde and bonnie emerge from the cafe into the early evening
they move toward the car they have stolen
just beyond sits a newer model car
bonnie is surprised to see clyde head toward the newer car
hey that aint ours
sure it is
but we came in this one
dont mean we have to go home in it
she walks amazed around the new car and gets in beside him
he turns the key and they pull away from the cafe
the room is bare
in the middle bonnie is waking having slept on a couple of car seats covered with an old piece of tattered blanket
there are windows behind her
she looks about bewildered
she starts to panic and runs to the window
at another window clyde appears
chagrined at her fear where you been keeping yourself
slept out by the car
these accommodations aint particularly deluxe
if theyre after us i want the first shot
come on you got some work to do
bonnie moves to the door and out of the house
on the door is a sign which reads wide angle
on the dilapidated picket fence six old bottles have been placed
as bonnie joins clyde he turns and fires six quick shots
the bottles disappear
got you all set up over here
they move around to the side of the building where clyde points to a tire hanging by a rope from a tree
he means that to be bonnies target
he hands her a gun
set her spinnin
come down slow with it
bonnie fires again and hits the tire
she smiles and blows the smoke from the barrel in pride and self mockery
aint you something
i tell you im going to get you a smith and wesson itll be easier in your hand
now try it again once
as she is about to fire a man appears around the corner of the building
she fires and hits the tire
clyde whirls at the sound
he grabs gun from bonnie because his is empty
he aims at farmer
frightened no sir
you all go right ahead
clyde watches him warily
continuing used to be my place
not any more
bank took it
clyde and bonnie start to move toward the farmer
all three move around to the front of the building
at a distance we see an okie car loaded with belongings
a woman with a baby in arms sits in front
a smaller boy stands outside the car
yessir moved us off
now it belongs to them
he points at the foreclosure sign
well thats a pitiful shame
clyde shakes his head sympathetically
he loads the empty gun
bitterly youre damned right mam
he looks up to see an old negro who has come from a distance shack and now stands near clydes car
nodding toward negro me and him put in the years here
so you all go right ahead
we just come by for a last look
he stands a moment looking at the house and then turns around toward his family in the car
clyde and bonnie look after him
clyde spins and fires three fast shots into the fore closure sign
the farmer stops and turns looking at clyde
clyde offers the gun to the farmer
he looks at it then accepts it
he slowly takes aim at the sign and fires
it pleases him
he looks at clyde and bonnie who smile
you all mind
bonnie and clyde are puzzled
come on over here
the negro moves toward them
now bonnie understands
she takes the second gun from clyde and hands it to davis
davis looks from bonnie to the farmer and toward the house
the farmer fires again
this time at a window
he nods to davis
davis slowly raises the gun and fires at another window
it shatters and they cant keep from laughing
the farmer returns the gun as does davis
continuing much obliged
he extends his hand
clyde shakes it
and this heres davis
we worked this place
formally miss bonnie parker
and im clyde barrow
across farmers car
the farmer turns and moves toward his people
davis moves toward his shack
clyde and bonnie in the b
bonnie and clyde
continuing we rob banks
bonnie turns quickly to look at clyde
he smiles and nods
a car is driving down it
it is the next day
bonnie is driving clyde beside her
you just stay in the car and watch and be ready
he is playing it cool knowing she is scared
he thinks hes james cagney okay now
he hands her a gun from the glove compartment you just be ready if i need you
bonnies hands are tense on the wheel
her face shows how nervous she is now that the time has come
they drive in silence
what are you thinkin about
we are still in the car
bonnie pulls over and stops by the bank
clyde is frozen in his seat
we can see that for all his talk he is scared too
what are you waitin for
that gets him
clyde throws the door open and jumps practically dives out the door
the camera follows his motion right inside the bank tracking very fast
something is very screwy here
the bank is dark the teller is half asleep over his books
clyde approaches thrusts the gun at him
with a swagger this is a stickup
just take it easy and nothin will happen to you
gimme the money
looking up with no fear his voice calm and conversational heighdy
nonplussed at this gimme the money
there aint no money here mister
totally befuddled at the turn of events what do you mean there aint no money
this here is a bank aint it
the camera pans around the bank
we see that it is empty dusty and shuttered
this was a bank
we failed three weeks ago
in a rage he goes behind the partition grabs the teller and pushes him ahead with the gun
clyde is fuming
he forces the teller out the front door
showing bonnie in the car
she is terrified as she sees clyde and the teller coming at her
she doesnt understand what is happening
shoving the teller forward tell her
acting like a man who has had his sleep interrupted by lunatics as i was tellin this gentleman our bank failed last month and aint no money in it
i sure am sorry
bonnies reaction is one of hysterical relief and appreciation of whats funny in the situation
she laughs uproariously she cant stop laughing
this makes clyde madder than ever
he shoves the teller to the ground
completely humiliated clyde gets in the car shoving bonnie over
she is still laughing
bonnie starts the car
clyde points his gun out the window
bank window whereon is lettered assets
angle to include bank window
clyde aims and puts a bullet through each of the zeros
we see each zero shot through
then the entire window hangs there for a second and suddenly crashes
on the soundtrack bonnies laughter
bonnie has still not fully recovered from her mirth but is quieting down because she sees that clyde is really mad and cant be pushed too far
steaming we got
and youre laughin
she tries to stop
the car pulls down another street of shops in another little hick town
a grocery store ahead
keep it running
there is an old clerk behind the counter and standing in the b
almost out of our vision is a butcher an enormous giant of a man
clyde steps up to the counter
give me a loaf of bread a dozen eggs and a quart of milk
the clerk gets the order and puts it in a bag
he rings open the cash register preparatory to asking clyde for the money
clyde pulls his gun
this is a stickup
ill take all the money in that drawer now
he reaches over the counter into the cash drawer and grabs the bills
suddenly looming beside clyde is the butcher brandishing a meat cleaver
camera looks up at this formidable sight as the cleaver comes crashing down missing clyde and sticking in the wooden counter
he grabs clyde around the chest in a bear hug and actually lifts him off the ground
the struggle is in silence
clyde is terrified fighting wildly to get free
the gun in clydes hand is pinned because the man has clydes arm pinned to his thigh
clyde tries to raise the barrel at an upward angle to shoot finally he is able to do so
the bullet enters the butchers stomach
the butcher screams but reacts like a wounded animal more furious than ever
he still holds clyde in a fierce hug staggering around the store knocking into shelves and spilling cans
clyde is hysterical with fear
he shoots the butcher again
the butcher falls to his knees but still he doesnt release clyde
in a panic clyde drags the man to the door trying to get out
bonnie sees clyde and the butcher holding his legs
she is terrified
clyde drags him out on the street
the butcher wont let go
clyde in real panic aims the gun at his head and fires
out of bullets
in blind fury he pistol whips the butchers head with two terrific swipes
finally the butcher lets go
hysterical clyde jumps away and leaps into the car on the other side
bonnie still at the wheel
get the hell out of here
they drive off at top speed
clyde is shaken
he speaks haltingly panting trying to get control of himself
damn him that big son of a bitch
he tried to kill me
i aint got eyes in back of my head
i didnt want to hurt him
it wasnt a real robbery
some food and a little bit of dough
im not against him
the car is speeding down an open road
suddenly it begins to buck and cough
there is something wrong with the motor
his cherubic cheeks are puffed up as he blows into the fuel lines of clydes car
there is a distinctly flat sound
reaction clyde and bonnie
clyde stands by the hood
bonnie remains seated in the car
clyde is covered with sweat and grease clearly he has gotten in his licks on the engine without success
neither he nor bonnie seems impressed by the noise c
as he screws back the fuel line and moves between bonnie and clyde to the ignition turning the engine over
it purrs beautifully
clyde is astonished
what was wrong anyway
moving back to screw on gas cap air bubble clogged the fuel line
now stands between bonnie and clyde
continuing i just blowed her away
clyde still cant get over it
you just blowed it away
he is embarrassed before bonnie
scuse me mam
anythin else i can do for you
clyde nods vigorously looking across c
s back to bonnie
bonnie gets the message
im not sure
she looks around say them little red things there stickin up
are they gas pumps
hes not too bright sure
isnt that interesting
how does that there gasoline get in my little old car
trying to be helpful well ysee theres this tank underground and the gas comes up this tube into the pump and into your car mam

well would you know what kind of a car this is

jerks his hand off it as if he touched a hot stove
getting in the conversation you aint scared are you

nervously uh nope with a put on sigh no he aint the one
unless boy you think you got enough guts for our line of work
affronted in his dumb way what do you mean
i served a year in the reform school

it takes to pull bank jobs with us
anxious to prove himself sure i could
sure i could
i aint scared if thats what you think
walks away from the car
camera remains where it was
we see him walk inside the gas station office open the cash drawer close it and come out
he emerges with a fistful of money
he walks over to bonnies window sticks his hand inside and drops the money on her lap
we see the bills flutter down
not a word is spoken
bonnie moves over into the middle
opens the door and gets in behind the wheel
for a moment we see them all sitting there each smiling their little smile
clyde starts to hum a hillbilly tune quietly
the sound track picks it up banjo and violin etc
and as the music swells they drive off down the road
a small room with a bed
on it covered by a sheet which humps like a mountain over his enormous stomach is the butcher
his head is propped up on a pillow and he sips a liquid through a bent glass straw
camera is on the left side of the head of the bed seeing the butcher in a three quarter profile
on the opposite side of the bed stands a uniformed patrolman who is in the act of flashing mug shot photos for the butcher to identify his assailant
the lawman holds a stack of them in front of them swiftly changing the cards like a grade school teacher with her flash cards
at each picture the butcher grunts negatively and goes on sipping from his glass straw
one picture two three go by
the fourth picture is a mug shot of clyde
again the butcher grunts no without hesitation
as the next picture comes into view we on a painted wooden sign lit by one attached light which reads motor court
camera is close on bonnie
she is awake and restless
comes the measured snoring that we will think comes from clyde
bonnie raises up and kneels over clyde
she needs him
clyde seems to snore on
camera drops between them and we see that the snoring actually comes from c
bonnie drops back on her pillow
we cut close on clyde
he is awake
bonnie clyde and c
seated in a booth in a cafe
the waitress brings the food and serves everybody
we see c
with great concentration as he does everything by relating to the immediate action he happens to be involved with he takes the sugar shaker and begins methodically sprinkling sugar over
all his food
he sugars the meat the beans and the beets
bonnie and clyde watch this performance with first amazement and second disgust
they cant believe what they see
what are you doing
why do you do that
beginning to eat it why not
its just disgusting thats why
chewing not to me it aint
but it makes everything sweet
yeah i know
with a resigned expression bonnie turns away and begins to eat
suddenly a look of consternation crosses c
he gets up and goes down to the counter on the other end of the restaurant out of our vision apparently planning to put mayonnaise over the sugar
the minute he is out of earshot bonnie gets clydes attention
clyde why does he have to stay in the same room as us
clyde seems not to have heard the question
he takes up the sugar shaker and spreads a thin field of sugar on the dark table surface
he will sketch his plan in the sugar
lemme show you about tomorrow
ll be waitin right outside in the car
here is the tellers cage
four of them and over here the desks and what have you
in the same room with us
hell where else
aint gonna spread out all over the state
the harshness of his tone concerns him and he recovers with a smile
continuing not yet anyway
now the door to the bank is here now
you cover me from there
takes his hand to her face just that i love you so much
youre the best damn girl in texas
comes back with the mayonnaise looks at the table
hey you spilled the sugar
eating the layout for tomorrow up in mineola
gosh thats four five hundred miles from here
we take u
to willis point dont you know and cut over on state highway at kaufman keep on goin till we hit the farm to market road that connects to and thats
right up by mineola
on a saturday afternoon
the car driving into a small kansas town
it is saturday afternoon sunny
the streets are filled with people cars wagons
is driving bonnie is in front with him clyde is in the back
looks scared to death at the idea of robbing a bank
the car pulls up in front of the bank double parked
bonnie and clyde get out
keep it running
bonnie and clyde enter bank
cut to the interior of the bank
bonnie and clyde come in assume the class positions she at the door where she can cover the bank clyde at the first tellers cage
in a very quiet voice this is a stickup
this is a stickup
this time everyone in the bank hears it
the people gasp and pull back
clyde slowly edges toward the door and prods bonnie forward
she carries a paper sack
clyde motions her to go from cage to cage and get all of the money
bonnie begins doing so while clyde keeps his gun trained on everybody
we see bonnie get the money from the first teller the second teller then
a car parked in a tight spot has just pulled out
close up c
day who suddenly looks delighted to see a parking space
immediately he methodically begins to back in
its a tight spot and he has to cut the wheel pull forward cut some more pull back and so on
the scene for the audience should be nervous and funny
inside the bank bonnie and clyde have filled the sack
they run out the door the camera tracks with them
they run for where the car was but it isnt there
then they see c
has parked it
suddenly realizes what a stupid thing hes done
tries to shoot out of the parking spot but he cant
he has to go through the business of backing up cutting the wheel and all of it
the scene is one of pure pandemonium and chaos
get it out
a policeman arrives and begins firing at car
gets the car halfway out of the spot scraping fenders in the process and the car is almost out when suddenly a face looms up at the window a dignified
white haired celluloid collared man obviously a bank official who has leaped onto the running board
his screaming can barely by distinguished from all the noise
clyde fires through the window
close up special effects
the face of the man explodes in blood
then he drops out of sight
the car shoots off down the road doing ninety
police are firing at the escaping car bonnie and clyde are shooting out the back window c
is almost having a nervous breakdown at the wheel
a police car that had been chasing clyde and bonnies car comes down the street
it is obvious that the cops have lost them
they are searching the street for a sign of clydes car
they pass a movie house whose marquee reads golddiggers of
they slow for a moment decide that is not a probable place to look
they drive off
the opening musical sequence of golddiggers is on the screen
ginger rogers sings were in the money
among the audience we cannot make out our three people
it is a small audience and thinly dispersed
tight shot at audience
camera pans the audience while on the track we hear the music of the song
first of our group who becomes visible is c
he is staring at the screen and eating bites from a candy bar in each hand
camera pans further and we see that clyde is in the row behind c
and a few seats to one side
clyde is nervous and keeps watching the entrance doors
he is in a rage
he shifts in his seat
boy you gotta be poor in the head
count of you i killed a man
shot from behind clyde
shooting toward screen
continuing dumb ass stupid
turns to clyde and nods agreement
this infuriates clyde even more
he slaps the back of c
ever do a dumb thing like that again ill kill you boy
angle at bonnie
she has been watching the movie is now disturbed by the noise
she turns back to clyde from her seat on the aisle
if you boys want to talk why dont you go outside
she smiles at her joke and turns back to the screen to the movie which she is obviously enjoying enormously
on the right of the screen f
bonnie stands at the sink fixing her make up in the mirror
the make up has become more conservative
on the left further back is a bathtub and in it sits c
his head and knees peek over the gray soapy water
he is engaged with his usual single minded concentration in washing himself carefully scrubbing his arms not a thought in his head
bonnie finishes her make up and regards herself quizzically tilting her head to look at herself at different angles
she is smoking a cigarette and really studying herself
what do you think of me c
well youre just fine i guess
uh well course youre a real good shot
well sometimes you look pretty as a painting
camera stays with bonnie during all this watching her look at herself as she listens to c
she has a narcissistic concern at the moment and as she hears him enumerate her values she thinks about each in turn and decides yes thats true
hey uh bonnie
could you get me that washrag there
responding automatically bonnie turns and walks to a towel rack pulls the washcloth off and starts toward c
when suddenly she stops with a smile on her face and a sudden motion
teasingly she holds the washcloth out at arms length
coyly whynt you come get it
not even realizing whats on her mind huh
wiggling the washcloth like a bull fighters cape whynt you come get it c
looks mortally embarrassed as he realizes what that would entail
aw bonnie come on gimme it
bonnie tries another tack
she begins sauntering over slowly teasingly still holding out the treasured washcloth
pertly all right ill bring it myself
as she moves closer to the tub c
realizes that she will be able to peer down into the tub and see him and he frantically reaches up with one hand and yanks the washcloth into the tub
causing a great splash
bonnie somewhat the victim of the splash jumps back and away
recovering her composure she looks at c
who is slunk down in the tub like a gross september morn
she has tried him and he has failed she realizes now that he was no choice for her no real man even if he might perform sexually
he is a lump
this irritates her his very presence is demeaning to herself and clyde
irritated with herself for even thinking of such a thing you simpleton what would you do if we just pulled out some night while you was asleep
trying to give the right answer but obviously faking it oh i wouldnt know what to do
but you wouldnt do that
you couldnt now
bonnie realizes with some weariness the inevitable truth of what hes said thus resigned she says patronizingly thats right c
well always be around to take care of you
pointedly she throws her cigarette in his bath water sssssssssss
she turns and leaves the bathroom slamming the door behind her
camera goes with her into the connecting bedroom
clyde is sitting on the edge of the bed cleaning the guns and oiling them
he is quiet and preoccupied and takes no note of bonnies present condition
the moment she enters he looks up
quietly bonnie i want to talk to you
bonnie sits a little taken off balance by his serious manner
but she listens quietly
continuing this afternoon we killed a man and we were seen
now nobody knows who you are yet but theyre going to be after me and anybody whos runnin with me
now thats murder now and its gonna get rough
clyde continues speaking carefully and gently
look i cant get out but right now you still can
you say the word and ill put you on the bus to go back to your mother
cause you mean a lot to me honey and i aint going to make you run with me
so if you want you say the word
bonnie moved by his offer has tears in her eyes
as he pauses why
we aint gonna have a minutes peace
bonnie doesnt like him in this mood
she tries to josh him out of it
trying to make her see the seriousness of it bonnie we could get killed
death has no reality for her whod wanna kill a sweet young thing like me
amused in spite of himself i aint no sweet young thing
oh clyde i cant picture you with a halo and if you went to the other place youd rob the devil blind so hed kick you right back to me
clyde touched deeply realizes that this was a lovely thing to say to him
they are near the bed on which are some guns that clyde has been cleaning
the kiss moves toward real love making
they are on the bed and push the guns aside
some fall to the floor
clyde breaks the embrace after it has reached a high pitch
he moves away from the bed toward the window
bonnie follows him and embraces him from the rear
they are miserable
bonnie frees him and returns to the bed
she falls on it face down
a gun presses into her face
clyde sits in the window the light silhouettes him
he turns his face toward the glass and rests his head on the window pane
bonnie turns to him from bed
she smiles a comforting smile at him
she rolls over onto her back
the gun is now under her head and moves it
she sits up and gestures to clyde
he remains at the window
she stares at him
she looks toward the bathroom
she looks back at clyde
she is moved and pained for him
she touches her cheek with the gun and waits for him to be able to look at her
finally he does
her look eases him and he almost smiles
shot of little fuzzy doll tied by a white shoestring to the rear view mirror of a car
the car is moving the doll is bouncing up and down
in the front seat are buck and blanche barrow
buck is a jovial simple big hearted man
a little chubby given to raucous jokes knee slapping and broad reactions
he is in many ways the emotional opposite of his brother
it doesnt take much to make him happy
blanche his wife is the direct opposite of bonnie
she is a housefrau no more and no less not terribly bright not very ambitious cuddly simpering madly in love with buck and desirous of keeping their lives on the
straight and narrow
as the scene begins we hear and then see buck driving singing the great speckled bird
blanche is sitting next to him looking at a movie magazine appearing fairly miserable
singing what a beautiful thought i am thinking concernin that great speckled bird remember his name is recorded on the pages of gods holy word
all right now you did foolish things as a young man honey love but you went and paid your debt to society and that was right
but now you just gettin back in with the criminal element
this is my brother darlin
shoot he aint no more criminal than you are blanche
well that aint what i heard
now word of mouth just dont go darlin you gotta have the facts
why he and me growed up together slept and worked side by side
laughing god what a boy he was
hes a crook
chidingly now you stop bad mouthin him blanche
were just gonna have us a little family visit for a few weeks and then well go back to dallas and ill get me a job somewheres
i just aint gonna work in your daddys church thats final
laughing it off singing what a beautiful thought i am thinking concernin that great speckled bird
bucks car drives up to the cabin honking the horn wildly
the door of the cabin opens and clyde comes running out
he is overjoyed to see his brother
buck jumps out of the car equally delighted
they hug each other
hugging him buck
you son of a bitch
they laugh happily and begin sparring with each other faking punches and blocking punches an old childhood ritual
there is a great feeling of warmth between the two brothers
clyde is more outgoing than we have ever seen him before
just fine just fine
send their best to you
patting bucks stomach hey youre fillin out there
must be that prison food
laughing its married life
you know what they say its the face powder that gets a man interested but its the baking powder that keeps him at home
he explodes with laughter and so does clyde who loves bucks jokes hey
you gotta meet my wife
hey honey cmon out here now and meet my baby brother
camera swings to car
we see blanche still sitting there her face obscured by the glint of sun on the windshield
slowly she gets out of the car still carrying the movie magazine
suspiciously quite the grand lady howdy do
shaking her hand howdy do
its real nice to know you
buck beams with pleasure thinking they must like each other
bonnie comes out of the cabin standing on the steps
the screen door slams behind her
day expressionless looking it all over
buck and clyde notice nothing of this
buck bounds over to bonnie all jollity
grabbing her well
you must be bonnie
now i hear you been takin good care of the baby in the family
well sis im real glad to meet you
he hugs her bonnie just lets herself be hugged say
breaking the hug id like you to meet my wife blanche
there is an awkward pause
suddenly the screen door opens and c
comes out dressed in his long underwear
blanche can hardly stand it
everybody this is c
my brother buck and his wife blanche
friendly heighdy yall
he pumps bucks hand vigorously and then goes to blanche
with his characteristic one track intensity he decides to act just as friendly as he can with blanche ignoring the fact that hes standing there in his underwear
blanche however is not ignoring it
well how do mrs
or can i call you blanch
i sure am pleased to meet you
shaking her hand blanche is slowly going crazy with mortification did you have a hard time findin us here in this neck of the woods
well you sure picked a good day for it
say you got a screenland there
any new photos of myrna loy
shes my favorite picture star
blanche is starting to edge over to buck in sheer panic at this strange young man in his bvds but c
takes no notice of it
blanche finally grabs bucks arm
bonnie watches it all smirking
hey lemme get the kodak
buck goes to his car and gets a folding brownie camera
lighting up a cigar hey c
go put your pants on
were gonna take some pictures
yall hear about the guy who thought western union was a cowboys underwear
buck and clyde and c
goes into the cabin
buck pushes blanche and clyde together posing them for a picture
lemme get one of my bride and my brother
getting kittenish and overdoing it buck
dont take my picture now
im just a mess from driving all day
oh honey now you look real fine
bonnie watches blanches behavior with hardly veiled disgust
buck snaps the picture as blanche is just about to move out of it
with unbecoming girlish outrage did you take my picture
i declare buck laughs and goes to bonnie takes her by the arm and moves her next to clyde and blanche
he lines them up steps back and takes their picture
clyde is the only one smiling
pulling out his gun and posing like a movie tough hey buck get one of this
giving clyde the camera clyde you do one of me and my missus
he puts his arm around blanche
clyde takes the picture
throwing her a challenge let me take on of bonnie
bonnie grins at him and responds with amused arrogance
she yanks the cigar from clydes mouth smokes it and poses okay
clyde snaps the picture
everyone but blanche laughs
comes out dressed
drawing clyde aside hey brother lets you and me do a little talkin
the camera here c
take the girls picture
they walk into the cabin
camera goes with them
bedroom is dark shades pulled down
there is an aura of boys clubhouse secret camaraderie in the following scene as soon as the door is shut conspiratorially it was you or him wasnt it
that guy you killed
you had to didnt ya
they are protecting each other yeah he put me in a spot so i had to
he didnt have a chinamans chance
but you had to yeah
i had to
like two kids keeping a secret from mom dont say nothin to blanche about it
hey that time you broke out of jail she talk you into goin back
it is obvious he had hoped clyde hadnt known about it yeah you hear about that
i wont say nothin to bonnie about it
i appreciate it
say what dya think of bonnie
shes a real peach
there is now a long pause a lull in the conversation as if they asked each other all the questions and are now out of things to say
it is too much for buck the natural enemy of silence who suddenly claps his hands together and bursts out animatedly boy are we gonna have us a good time
matching his merriment we surely are
a pause then what are we gonna do
well hows this i thought wed all go to missouri
they aint lookin for me there
well hole up someplace and have us a regular vacation
no trouble now
i aint lookin to go back to prison
hey whats this i hear about you cuttin up your toes boy
ironically that aint but half of it
i did it so i could get off work detail breakin those damned rocks with a hammer day and night
sure enough next week i got paroled
i walked out of that god forsaken jail on crutches
shoot aint life grand
we see the two cars one behind the other driving down a main road
clyde is driving
buck sits next to him
no one else is in the car
and the doc he takes him aside says son your old mama just gettin weak and sickly layin there
i want you to persuade her to take a little brandy yknow to pick her spirits up
why doc he says you know my mamma is a teetotaler
she wouldnt touch a drop
well i tell you what the doc says why dont you bring her a fresh quart of milk every day from your farm cept you fix it up so half
of its brandy and dont let on
so he does that doctors it up with brandy and his mamma drinks some of it
and the next day he brings it again and she drinks some more and she keeps it up every day
finally one week later he brings her the milk and dont you know she just shallows it all down and looks at her bag and says son whatever you do
dont sell that cow
clyde and buck explode in laughter
at the top of the laugh cut to the int
of the second car riding right in back of them
the atmosphere is completely unlike the cozy and jolly scene preceding
we have dead silence
bonnie is driving smoking a cigarette grim
blanche seated as far away as she can get from bonnie without falling out of the car makes a face at the cigarette smoke rolls down the window for air
s in the back seat just staring
a residential street in joplin missouri showing a garage apartment above a double garage
camera sees buck talking to a dapper gent with keys in his hand
buck pays him
the man tips his hat and walks off
buck gestures and clyde drives a car into the driveway
follows driving bucks car with blanche
clyde stops beside buck
buck leans into clydes car and says i give him a months rent in advance
were all set
lets get inside
clyde calls back to c
in the following car
pull up and unload the stuff
on the running board of moving car honey love im taking you into our first home
the two cars pull up before the garage and the people start to descend
a winded buck enters and puts down blanche
as others behind him carry in their things and disperse throughout apartment
oh look its so clean buck
and a frigidaire
not an icebox
he give me the grocery number
he goes to the phone
continuing lemme see eh
please mam may i have
if you please
they got linoleum on the counter
aint that clever
hello smittys grocery
id like to order a mess of groceries
eh hillsdale street
lessee about pounds of porkchops pounds of red beans
a can of chase and sandborn
oh isnt this something daddy
quart of milk
uh bottles of dr
pepper and thats it i guess
a box of rice krispies
open on bonnie and clyde
he is cleaning guns
she is watching something off screen
we hear a clicking sound
my you need a haircut daddy
you look like a hillbilly boy
a look of disgust crosses bonnies face
clyde who has been watching her smiles
the clicking sound increases suddenly
camera cuts to see that buck and c
are playing checkers and buck has just beaten him
boy you aint never gonna beat me but you keep tryin now
he starts to set up the game again
jest like an ol man
plays checkers all the time and doesnt pay any attention to his poor lonely wife
she ruffles his hair again
cut it out now honey
im gonna teach this boy a lesson hell never forget
camera cuts to bonnie watching with disgust
then slowly a wicked little smile edges across her face
she watches for a moment more then she rises and with the most ingenuous look she can muster up beckons to clyde to follow her into the bedroom
a little puzzled clyde follows
bonnie closes the door and immediately begins fussing with clydes hair doing a scathing imitation of blanche
though her miming expresses her irritation at being closeted with the barrow menage it is also a peach doing an imitation of a lemon and it is disarmingly sensual
indeed the mimicry allows bonnie to be physically freer with clyde and allows clyde to respond without anxiety without self consciousness
we should have the distinct if momentary feeling that clyde could suddenly make it with bonnie
doing an unmerciful imitation oh daddy you shore need a haircut
you look just like a little old hillbilly boy i do declare
she has her other hand toying with the buttons on his shirt her hand slipping under fluttering across his bare chest oh mercy me oh my stars
clyde laughs and bonnie tugs at the shirt she kneels on the bed over clyde who quite easily drapes across it
a little louder oh daddy
yore such a slowpoke
shes letting her hair fall loose its golden ends brushing up and down clydes body
amused but cautionary hush up a little
theyre in the next room
a mock pout but with an edge to it shoot theres always somebody in this room the next room and ever other kind of room
clyde has his arm around bonnie and shes almost draped across him but in the direction of the length of the bed so their bodies almost form a crooked cross
she digs an elbow into his stomach
now that aint no nice way to talk about my brother
imitating blanche again with baby talk i aint talking about your brother
suddenly bonnie straightens up to a kneeling position again and cocks her head
when she speaks now it is with a simple plaintiveness
honey do you ever just want to be alone with me
sensing clydes sensitivity to the sexual implication i dont just mean like that
i mean do you ever have the notion of us bein out together and alone like at some fancy ball or i dont know where we walk in all dressed
and they announce us and its fancy and in public but were alone somehow
were separate from everybody else and they know it
clyde looks up to bonnie affectionately
he runs his hand carelessly down her body
i always feel like were separate from everybody else
its terribly important to her do you baby
suddenly there is a ring at the door
bonnie and clyde freeze
bonnie and clyde run out into the living room camera going with them
to all quiet
ill get it
bonnie goes down the stairs and reaches the front door
who is it
she opens the door
a young man is there with the two big sacks of groceries
six dollars and forty three cents
bonnie pays him and goes to take the bags from him
here mam them bags is heavy
let me carry em up for you
curtly no thanks ill take em
she takes the heavy bags and hefts them up and turns and walks up the stairs
they are obviously very heavy for her
closeup the delivery boys face looking puzzled at this behavior
bonnie reaches the top steps and voices are heard
what was it
open the door
the delivery boy
a look of suspicion comes across his face
close up of bonnie seated in the living room
reading from a pad in a recital voice its called the ballad of suicide sal
she pauses for effect then begins we each of us have a good alibi for being down here in the joint but few of them really are justified if you
get right down to the point
youve heard of a womans glory being spent on a downright cur
you write that all by yourself
you want to hear this or not
as she reads the camera pans around the room picking out everyones reaction
clyde is looking and listening seriously
buck is grinning
blanche is in the kitchen cooking
still you cant always judge the story as true being told by her
now sal was a gal of rare beauty though her features were coarse and tough yeah i knew her
she was cockeyed and had a hare lip and no teeth
bonnie flashes him a look that could kill
he shuts up fast
she continues now sal was a gal of rare beauty though her features were coarse and tough she never once faltered from duty to play on the up and up
still listening clyde gets up from his chair and walks slowly past the living room windows
the camera angled slightly above him sees down the street
we see two police cars quietly pulling up
one of them parks sideways in the driveway to block escape from the garage the other stays on the street
clyde turns and looks out the window
as we see out the window sal told me this tale on the evening before she was turned out free and ill do my best to relate it just as
she told it to me seeing it its the law
as soon as clyde calls out blanche drops the frying pan on the floor and begins screaming
camera cuts back to the living room
everyone else leaps into action
guns begin blazing from everywhere we rarely see who is shooting at whom
the police down the stairs into the garage we follow them with a hand held camera tracking rapidly
blanche however in utter panic just runs right out the front door and begins running down the quiet residential street going nowhere anywhere
buck crouching shooting with one hand gets the garage door open
a policeman fires
buck fires back and the cop falls dead in the street
buck firing dashes to the police car blocking their escape and releases the hand brake
clyde bonnie and c
leap into their car gun the motor still shooting madly
two more police fall dead or wounded
one policeman is hurled through a fence by the blast of a sawed off shotgun
buck jumps into the car with the others
they now begin to bump the police car with their car
the police car picks up speed as they push it and it tears into the street right at the group of firing police
the gangs car turns into the street toward the running blanche
bonnie and clyde are in front buck and c
in the back seat firing back at police
the car pulls alongside the wildly running blanche the back door is flung open and in almost the style of a cartoon two hands reach out and lift her off
her feet and pull her into the car
they speed away
the inside of the car still speeding
blanche is hysterical
is still firing out the window
the pursuing police cars driver is shot and the car crashes into a tree
the gang is not being pursued now but clyde is driving at
blanche is moaning and crying
bonnie in front turns around furiously
dammit you almost got us killed
crying what did i do wrong
i spose youd be happier if i got shot
at her bitchiest yeah it would of saved us all a lot of trouble
buck dont let that woman talk to me like that
caught in the middle of a bad situation knowing blanche is wrong but trying to soothe her you shouldnt have done it blanche
it was a dumb thing to do
switching tactics please buck i didnt marry you to see you shot up
please lets go
lets get out of here and leave
make him stop the car and let us out
still quietly cant
i killed a man
were in this now
loud and shrill please
exploding shut up
just shut up your big mouth
at least do that will ya just shut up
cut it out bonnie
bonnie is affronted
blanche continues sobbing
curtly stop the car
i want to talk to you
without a word clyde stops the car
bonnie and clyde get out and walk fifteen feet away from the car
both are irritated and touchy
camera follows them
coldly what is it
get rid of her
cant do that
shes bucks wife
snapping her words get rid of both of them then
whats the matter with you anyway
shes whats the matter with me a damn stupid back country hick without a brain in her head
contemptuously she aint nothin but prunes and proverbs
really pissed off at bonnie what makes you any better
what makes you so damn special
youre just a west dallas waitress who spent half your time pickin up truck drivers
this hits home with bonnie
he has said the unforgivable
raising her voice you talk to me like that
big clyde barrow just the same as your brother an ignorant uneducated hillbilly
with deadly archness only special thing about you is your peculiar ideas about lovemakin which is no love makin at all
the two of them stand silent and tense almost quivering with anger
they have stripped each other raw
clyde turns and looks back at the car
everyone is waiting watching them
he breathes a deep sigh like a man counting to to hold his temper
look bonnie he cant finish
she drops her head into her hand for a moment comes up a little more relaxed
she looks at clyde and her eyes reflect the realization of the pain she has inflicted on him
i didnt mean all that honey
blame it on all that shootin i just felt so bad
lets get movin
he turns and begins walking back to the car
bonnie walks alongside him
on the few steps back she regains all her dignity and acts aloof from the others waiting for her
she reaches the car
clyde opens her door for her and she gets in like a great lady
he walks around to his side gets in and they drive off
a very wide shot
we see clydes car driving along a wooded road
for a moment that is all we see then we should become aware that far in the distance another car is following clydes
rural mail box
on the opposite side of the road clydes car swings across the road and clyde who is driving snatches a newspaper which protrudes from the box and hands it into
they drive out of the shot
camera holds and soon the following car enters the shot
the man driving is a texas ranger
he drives slowly
he drives out of the shot
buck is reading from the paper
jubilantly hey yall listen to this here law enforcement officers throughout the southwest are frankly amazed at the way in which will of the wisp bandit clyde barrow and his
yellow haired companion bonnie parker continue to elude their would be captors
since engaging the police in a gun battle on the streets of joplin missouri and slaying three of their number
we notice clyde is wincing
the barrow gang has been reported as far west as white city new mexico and as far north as chicago
they have been credited with robbing the mesquite bank in the aforementioned white city the j
landry oil refinery in arp texas the sanger city national bank in denton texas on three different occasions
in addition to these robberies the fast travelling barrows have been rumored to have had a hand in the robbing of two piggly wiggly stores in texas and one a
p store in missouri though chief percy hammond who first identified clyde barrows brother buck as a member of the gang expressed some doubt that these last robberies were committed by the barrow gang alone
finally clyde we aint goin to see a restroom for another thirty miles
why dont you just stop here
clyde looks relieved
he pulls the car to a stop gets out and goes off into the woods
we watch him vanish behind the trees
buck still scanning the newspaper
with a laugh hey now heres something
listen here lone cop arrests two officers in hunt for barrow
police officer howard andersons heart turned faster than his motorcycle when he forced to the side of the road a roaring black v sedan in which were three men and
a blondheaded woman yesterday afternoon
as buck continues to read his voice remaining on the soundtrack
the camera goes outside the car and pulls back way back to reveal a police car quietly driving up behind the car
the car stops a good distance away and one man gets out the only occupant of the car
he is tall dressed in the uniform of the texas ranger
he draws his gun and slowly approaches the car from the rear
on the soundtrack bucks voice continues as we see all this taking place
when he saw several machine guns in the car he was certain hed caught clyde barrow bonnie parker and maybe buck barrow and the third unidentified member of the gang
it took a lot of telephoning and explaining to convince the motorcycle cop that his captives were two highway patrolmen and a blonde haired stenographer from the highway patrol
everybody busts up with laughter in the meantime on screen the lawman is slowly approaching the back of the car
suddenly cut to shot of clyde coming out of the woods behind the lawman
his gun is tucked in his pants
in a second he sees what is happening
bucks voice is continuing anderson was held up as an example for every other texas peace officer today
that was a mighty brave thing explained highway patrol chief l
clyde whips out his gun
the following scene is played exactly like a classic fast draw in an heroic western
bryce spins around
both men fire instanteously but clyde has the draw on him and the aim
the gun goes flying from the sheriffs hand
a really razzle dazzle display of grandstand marksmanship from clyde
immediately the gang leaps from the car and surrounds the man guns drawn
what a shot clyde
sweet jesus i never seen shootin like that
the gang grabs the man and takes his handcuffs from his belt
clyde makes him lean on the cars hood arms extended legs spread while he frisks him
in general everyone is excited over the capture
bonnie takes the sheriffs gun and delicately places it on the radiator grill like an object dart
examining the mans wallet really surprised well now getta load of this
i want yall to know we are in the custody of capn frank bryce and frank here is a texas ranger
angle across hood so bryces face not visible to clyde or anyone else behind him is in foreground
his gnarled powerful hands tremble slightly on the hood as tho they might crinkle the metal like so much tissue paper
his eyes stare toward camera relentlessly unblinking but without passion
they are sharks eyes
they have witnessed much carnage devoured it and are still wide open for more
sure nough clyde
say there peacemaker
i believe you got your spurs all tangled up
youre in missouri you know that
clyde has been going thru the mans credentials
not so pleasantly you didnt know you was in missouri
hes lost this here texas ranger
clyde claps bryces hands behind his back handcuffs him spins him around
a little pissed he aint lost
them banks are offerin extra reward money fer us and frank figured on easy pickins didnt you
he suddenly knocks bryces hat off didnt you
bryce flinches involuntarily
buck suddenly grows wary at clydes mood
clyde leans into bryce looking up
now you aint hardly doin your job texas ranger
you oughta be home lookin after the rights of poor folks not out chasin after us
he suddenly hefts bryces huge bulk onto the fender
trying to be casual easy there clyde
why take is so personal
to bryce reglar laws is one thing
but this here bounty hunting we got to discourage that
blanche looks very uncomfortable
she starts to say something but buck intervenes
like how clyde
a tense moment
clyde cant think of anything right away
trying to be helpful shoot him
bonnie shoots c
an angry glance its just what the gang doesnt want
trying again hang him
reaction bonnie carefully gauging the moment to intervene
suddenly uh uh
take his picture
clydes not sure hes heard right
neither is c
take his picture
pointedly ignoring c
brightly then well let the newspapers have it sos everyone can see captain frank bryce of the texas rangers with the barrow gang moving demurely to bryce and all bein
just as friendly as pie
grasping possibilities immediately yeah yeah
continuing right on coyly picking up bryces gun from grill why we bout the friendliest folks in the world
texas ranger waves his big ol gun at us and we just welcome him like hes one of our own
grinning widely buck get the kodak
relieved and excited hot dog
to bryce were mighty proud to have a texas ranger in the family
bryce is obviously not pleased with this turn of events
following dialogue is overlapped ad libbed etc
a sense of mounting glee at the kind of vengeance they are going to exact
buck is fiddling with the camera setting up the shot with clyde
bucks following speech should be heard b
to clydes speech below it
keep him set on the hood there
more to the sun like that
when all his ranger friends see this
i bet hes gonna wish he was dead
to bryce see what come o your mischief
not doin your job
down in duncanville last year poor farmers kepts the laws away from us with shot guns
youre sposed to be protectin them from us and theyre protectin us from you
giggling dont make sense do it
cmon now clyde you and bonnie first
move into him right close right friendly
all righty to bryce whose hands are tied hemmed in by them both dont move now hear
clyde grandly puts an arm on bryces shoulder bonnie looking up admiringly from the other side
buck takes the picture
bonnie immediately hops onto the hood next to hows this
captain bryce and new found friend
she coyly loosens his tie tousles his hair and plants a big kiss on him while still ogling camera
quick buck get it
im gettin it im gettin it
quite suddenly bryce whose simmering intensity we should be more sensitive to than the gang is spits on bonnie
bonnie half screams in disgust but clyde is on top of bryce in a flash half strangling on his own fury
he pulls bryce off the fender by the handcuffs spinning him around crazily like a lasso
bryce is literally ricocheted off the car by the force and with clyde hanging on by the cuffs plummets down the embankment to the sandy beach below both men falling
bryce rises shakily
he tries to walk away
clyde grabs him again by the handcuffs and hurls him out into the water
bryce smacks into a tree stump poking out of the shallows and goes down
clyde is on top of him
meanwhile buck has rushed down into the water tries to pull clyde off bryce
frantic i got the picture
i got the picture
oblivious lemme be lemme be
bryce reaches the surface and clyde tries to throw him into deeper water
he hitches bryce over a moldy skiff knocking aside one of the oars
buck upends bryce into the skiff and kicks it spinning
clyde picks up an oar and hurls it like a boomerang ass over end at the skiff
it kicks up a spray
holding tightly to clyde yelling i got the picture
clyde waist deep breathing heavily
all right all right
to bryce yelling bryce battered and handcuffed stares back with mindless malice from the lazily spinning skiff to the hysterical spectre of clyde screaming his madness across the water
inside the bank
in contrast to the previous inept bank robbery scene this one goes admirably well the gang performing slickly and without a hitch
as they enter dripping wet clyde makes a general announcement to everyone to the bank
this is the barrow gang
the people turn and freeze everybody just take it easy and nobody will get hurt
clyde covers the door
bonnie and buck go to the tellers cages and get money
buck goes inside emptying out the cash drawers
cut to bonnie filling the sack
cut to a close up of a burglar alarm button
slowly a hand crawls up the wall and a finger slowly moves to push the button
when the finger is about one inch away suddenly a gun appears in the frame and gently taps the hand away
the camera pulls back to reveal buck smiling at a lady teller
dont do nothin silly now
cut to clyde standing near the door training his guns on the entire bank
a farmer stands a few feet away some bills clutched in his hand
that your money or the banks
keep it then
across the floor the bank guard in the corner takes advantage of clydes distraction to go for his gun
clyde spots it and fires a shot that just knocks the bank guards hat off without harming him
to the guard who has practically frozen in fear next time ill aim a little lower
they finish robbing the bank
they start to exit
near the door stands a guard with his hands raised
he wears sun glasses of the period
as they leave buck snatches the sun glasses from the guards head
get a good look at us
were the barrow boys
the gang runs wildly into the street where the car waits motor running
as they leap into car buck throws the sun glasses into blanches lap
they zoom off
shots are heard
bonnie buck and clyde begin firing at the bank guards who are pursuing them
the guards fire back
blanche sitting in the back seat with her fingers stuck tightly in her ears eyes shut trying to overcome her panic
a funny image but one that also awakens pity
the next sequence is carried out in cross cutting
the street in front of the bank
police car pulls up and the excited crowd gestures in the direction of the departed gang
the siren starts
the siren heard now in the far distance
at the wheel kick it in the pants c
we got to make that state line
driving like a wild man but adlibing loudly cant get moren this out of a plymouth
the gang has left a legacy of celebrity behind
we see the bank guard whose hat was shot off being interviewed by a reporter
he is seated in a chair his shirt open at the collar and a woman teller is fanning him
enjoying the limelight then he saw me goin for my gun
clyde barrow himself i mean
and suddenly i was starin into the face of death
a photographer steps in
just look this way mr
the bank guard hurriedly buttons up his collar and smiles as the flashbulb goes off
still speeding along the siren more distant
the bank president and a policeman are posing for that classic picture where both stand flanking a bullet hole in the wall and point proudly at it
the flashbulb goes off
two men in police uniforms following bonnie and clyde
step on it randolph
we gotta catch em fore they reach the state line
farmer is describing bonnie and clyde to passersby who dote on him as though hed just had contact with a portion of the true cross
farmer is aware of his position
he looked like well he looked real
and bonnie shes too much a lady ever to be caught with a cigar in her mouth
i dont care what you heard before
i saw em right here not twenty minutes ago
gravely and alls i can say is they did right by me and im bringin me a mess of flowers to their funeral
car slows up perceptibly as clyde says okay relax
were in oklahoma now
dont waste no more gas
a young eager beaver type aint we gone to catch em
hell theyre over the state line
thats out of our jurisdiction
why dont we get em anyway
i aint gone to risk my life in oklahoma
thats their problem
now the gangs car is seen traveling down a long narrow country road surrounded by cornfields
they get out taking the various bags of money with them and dump the lot on the hood
there is not an impressive amount of money
that aint much is it
commiseratingly times is hard well lets get to it
he begins dealing and splitting the money out on the hood of the car as they gather around
this is clyde barrow
lays down a bill buck barrow
lays down a bill bonnie parker
goes back to the first again and lays out another round clyde buck
clyde clyde again
buck and blanche stand watching
blanche looks fretful
she nudges buck and whispers to him
buck whispers something back to her
meanwhile clydes counting still goes on
very ill at east in this position he has been forced into um
buck is clearly embarrassed
what about blanche
everyone reacts with stunned amazement at blanches nerve in wanting to get her cut
incredulous blanche sees she has to rise to her own defense and she rises to the occasion with spirit and verve
well why not
say i earned my share
same as everybody
i coulda got killed same as everybody and im wanted by the law same as everybody
besides i coulda got snake bit sleepin in them woods every night
building it up im just a nervous wreck and thats the truth
and i have to listen to sass from miss bonnie parker all the time
i deserve mine
day looking at clyde his face full of weak smiles and embarrassment at his wife
with a sigh okay
hold your horses blanche
youll get your share
bonnie is livid but says nothing
clyde the leader has decided
looks indignant like a hog whos just been given a bath
clyde begins counting all over again in near silence
married a preachers daughter and she still thinks shes takin the collection
everyone now laughs but blanche
clyde continues counting
to blanche well dont spend it all in one place now hear
shell be doin right well to spend it at all
bonnie turns and ambles away from the car
after a moment clyde stops counting and moves after her
hes prepared for a fight stands behind bonnies arched back trying to gauge the degree of hostility there
a little defensive look bonnie ive said it and i guess ill keep sayin it before were thru blanche is bucks wife and buck is family
he waits expectantly
finally utterly without malice shes such a silly billy
bonnie looks plaintively to clyde
my family could use some of that money
them laws have been hangin round your mamas house til all hours bonnie
its just too risky to go there
exploding well where can we go
we rob the damn banks what else do we do
clyde cannot really answer
starts yelling clyde flinches at the sound
comes bounding over as rude an assault on their sensibilities as he can be
wincing as they are nose to nose i hear you c
this ol heaps gushin oil
we got to swipe us another set of wheels right away or we wont get anywhere
he reaches down under the pan of the car and scoops a gooey handful of slick black oil which he holds before their faces
clyde nods slowly
he looks back to bonnie
a residential neighborhood on a suburban street
a rather well to do neighborhood
the camera is up on a porch of a white frame house looking toward the street
on the porch sitting in the swing in the left f
are a man and a woman
she is about twenty nine he is about thirty six
he is sitting with his back to us embracing the woman
they are spooning making low loving murmurs
we see in the distance two cars parked in front of the house
his and hers
suddenly we see another car drive up bonnie and clyde and somebody gets out
then the whole gang gets out ditches the one car and gets in one of the parked cars
all the while the couple on the porch is busy spooning
the car begins to roll slowly into the street
the woman notices
say isnt that your car eugene
still nuzzling her mmmmmm
he looks leaps from the swing thats my car
the man and woman run down the front steps and front walk to the second car
they jump in and take off giving chase
the woman is driving its her car
the man is furious
ill tear em apart
steal a mans car right out from under him
wait till i get my hands on those kids velma ill show em
they continue driving furious the man cursing and muttering
we see through their windshield the other car way in the distance
what if they have guns eugene
realizing the possibility he suddenly stops being mad and turns chicken wed better get the police and let them handle this
turn around and lets get back to town
well go get the sheriff
they are by now on a narrow dirt road and the woman has to execute a u turn
it takes her about seven cuts to turn the car around in the narrow space
they start back to town
buck looks out the rear window
they stopped chasin us
they turned around
clyde grinning mischievously
lets take em
buck and c
laugh appreciatively at the reversal
clyde turns the car around
he performs the u turn in the same narrow space in one swift smooth beautiful turn
velma looks in the rear view mirror and sees that now she is being chased
oh my lord theyre comin after us
in a panic step on it velma step on it
velma jams it down to the floor
the car speeds
bonnie and clydes car gaining on them gaining on them gaining on them and finally overtaking them coming up and ahead forcing them to the side of the road
the man and womans car
terrified they roll up their windows lock their doors and huddle together
the barrow gang piles out of their car and walks over having a merry time
they surround the car and press their faces against the window flattening their features making menacing gestures at the shaking pair inside
we see this from the point of view of the man and woman inside the car
clyde pulls out a gun makes as if to shoot but he is kidding
they all laugh uproariously especially buck who is delighted with clydes prank
all of this we see in pantomime from inside the trapped car
cmon get out
get out of there i said
they come out hands held high shaking with fear
they have practically turned to jelly
ordering them into the other car get in here
they get in and the gang gets in
seven people are now jammed inside
clyde drives bonnie next to him c
next to her
in back blanche then eugene with velma of necessity sitting on his lap and then buck
as will be seen the reason the barrows have kidnapped the couple is simply that they wanted company
living as they do seeing only each other day after day they long for diversion and new faces
so the atmosphere in the car will shortly change to one of friendliness and jollity and it will get progressively more so in the series of cuts which advance the
as the car starts up at the beginning however the man and woman are terrified
whats your name
hesitantly im eugene grizzard
im velma davis
just as friendly as he can be well howdy
were the barrow gang
that there is clyde drivin and im buck
the man and woman almost faint from fear clutch at each other
the gang all laugh at this
velma and eugene begin to realize that they are not going to get hurt and that the barrows are friendly to them
look dont be scared folks
it aint like you was the law
youre just folks like us
agreeing over enthusiastically yeah yeah thats the truth
i expect you been readin about us
the man and the woman answer simultaneously with what they think is the right thing to say under the circumstances
they glare at each other
meaningfully yes velma we have too
laughing at the contretemps well you two must be in love i bet
eugene and velma blush get shy for a second
gleefully clapping his hands well when you gonna marry the girl boy
everyone chuckles heartily
still driving same positions but some time has elapsed
the atmosphere is now completely convivial and the captives are enjoying their new friends
as the scene starts buck is finishing his joke
so then she drinks her milk down again every drop
and she looks over at her son and says son whatever you do dont sell that cow
the couple laughs with great amusement but everyone else in the car doesnt laugh this is the tenth time theyve heard the joke
getting on toward evening
all are thoroughly relaxes and chatting
to velma how old are you honey
a sudden look of surprise registers on eugenes face
it is now night
everyone inside the car is eating
apparently they stopped somewhere along the way for food
in the crowded interior it is like a party food is being passed back and forth laughter and gaiety increasing warmth between the couple and the barrows
the car has become a little society on wheels dashing through the black night down the highway
inside there is a small world of happiness and fun
buck is unpacking the food and passing sandwiches and drinks around the car
now i ordered some french fries didnt i
passing her some yeah here you go
take it easy on those french fries velma
aint that right eugene
studying his hamburger this isnt mine
i ordered mine well done
whos got the other hamburger
who has already taken a bite of the other one
oh is this supposed to be yours
he extends the bitten burger out to eugene
thats okay forget it
clyde laughs at this
i sure am havin a good time
how bout you folks
aint you glad we picked you up
laughing hey maybe yall ought to join up with us
that idea strikes everyone as being very amusing
wouldnt they be surprised back home to hear that
what would martha and bill say if they heard that
she roars with laughter
theyd throw a fit
roars with laughter laughing what do you do anyway
as his laugh begins to fade im an undertaker
suddenly everyone freezes
a shudder as if the cold hand of death had suddenly touched the occupants of the car
the atmosphere changes to cold deadly fearful silence in exactly one second
it is a premonition of death for the barrows and they react accordingly bonnie especially
tautly in a flat voice get them out of here
the car brakes to a sudden stop
the rear down is opened the man and woman flung out into the darkness
the car drives off into the lonely night
from this point on the audience should realize that death is inevitable for the barrow gang that it follows them always that it waits anywhere
it is no longer a question of whether death will come but when it will
moving with clyde he tears through the brush snagging his clothes calling bonnies name
clydes search is so desperate here that for a moment we might think he is fleeing from something rather than looking for something
in a moment he emerges onto the road
the car with c
driving and buck and blanche beside him is patrolling slowly up ahead of him
clyde spots it and runs toward it
hold on this angle until he catches up with it and leaps onto the running board
clyde now on the running board his head poked into the car his face apple red and sweating
breathing heavily see anythin buck
buck is shocked at his brothers desperation but makes no overt comment on it
not yet boy
with an edge of paranoia as if the three of them might be withholding something from him and nobody saw her leave or heard anythin almost a threat clyde gets
for the very first time we see clyde the leader helpless as he hangs onto the running board
lamely well where do you think she couldve gone
amazed and a little frightened jesus i dont know
clyde looks helplessly at his brother then drops off the running board and continues on foot running along scanning the fields the car keeping up beside him as he runs
and we truck before both car and clyde
angle on car through windshield
buck turning to blanche shrugging his shoulders speechless
reverse angle through the windshield
day at clyde who has suddenly seen something begins gesticulating wildly almost from cars pov a little comically
he starts running off into a cornfield
another angle picking up clyde as he kicks his way into the cornfield knees pumping high knocking down the stalks
he stops and picks up the stocking he had spotted takes it and moves on
still another angle as clyde has picked up a freshly beaten trail through the cornfield
he picks up one of bonnies scarves now
as he runs on he clears a knoll and bonnie her yellow hair unmistakable even at this distance comes into view
shes far off in the cornfield stalking off looking neither to right nor left carrying a brown paper sack that has split from which she has occasionally lost clothing
clyde screams bonnie
she apparently doesnt hear
angle on cornfield
as clyde gets closer
bonnie herself suddenly breaks into flight the paper bag splitting completely the remaining clothes spilling out
there is a real chase where they each try to get the advantage
clyde is so exhausted from his run that he has real trouble cornering her as they maneuver up and down the rows of corn
finally clyde catches up
extreme close up
as they tumble into the stalks of corn mowing them down
leave me alone
leave me alone
holding her kissing her frantically hey
hey hey baby hey bonnie hey baby
calming her down hey hey now
just where did you think you were goin
bonnie doesnt answer
as hes momentarily distracted by bucks laughter as hes in the cornfield picking up bonnies clothing
clyde waves an impatient its all right wave
he turns back to bonnie who he still holds tightly
still frantic huh
i dont know
youre hurting me i was just scared is all
and my mamas been on my mind and shes gettin so old
bonnie hesitates beginning to feel a little foolish now
boy dont ever leave without sayin somethin
you really scared me bonnie
but i mean it though
i want to see my mama
bonnie and clyde
enormously relieved kissing her okay sweetheart
of three or four cars parked on the side of a road in texas
a light rain is falling
there are a lot of people gathered around but the sound is an indistinct mixture of talk laughter etc
there follows a quick montage of cuts which isolate specific moments in the family reunion thereby implying the entire tone of the proceedings
the sense of family pervades
bonnie and mother
bonnies mother an old woman grabs her and hugs her and cries
bonnie clyde man
a man an uncle perhaps stands with bonnie and clyde arms around them both hugging them to his sides tightly
bonnie and sister
bonnies sister hands them a scrapbook of clippings
here you are we been cuttin and pastin everything we could find about you in the papers
clyde bonnie buck and blanche all look at the scrapbook
we see a page of it showing newspaper articles with the photographs the gang took back at the motel
hey look heres that one i took of you clyde
that came out just fine
bonnie clyde man
bonnie and clyde are posing for a comic snapshot
a silly looking male relative is posing pointing a gun at them
they have their hands in the air and are grinning broadly
the effect should be funny and simultaneously frightening
montage buck small boy
buck is sitting with a little four year old on his knee bouncing him up and down and singing
both are having a fine time
singing oh horsey
keep your tail up keep yer tail up keep yer tail up oh horsey
keep yer tail up why dont you make it rise
a hand off camera thrusts a sandwich at c
he opens the bread to see whats inside it then eats it
montage bonnie sister
bonnie sits stock still while her sister gives her a permanent in the back seat of a car
he sister pauses setting down the curling iron
she strokes bonnies yellow head with her hand as though she were a wild animal that had paused long enough to be petted
bonnie turns to see her sisters expression
montage family picnic favoring clyde mother bonnie
clyde in his best theatrical manner has been playing host in the sand pile perhaps using some sort of towel across the arm or around the middle
the party is beginning to break up now as used paper plates and crumpled napkins are blowing across the sand and the group is finishing up on eskimo pie
rising where yall headed from here
right back i dont know what yall got in mind
at this point we aint headin to anywhere were just runnin from
clyde laughs in fine spirits
cmon down litte tom
were goin home
mathew fetch little tom
dont go yet mama
cutting in cmere cmere you little corn roller
as uncle sweeps up the laughing little tom
bonnie turns with increased urgency to her mother who having been hefted to her feet by bonnies sister has turned to clyde who gives her a big boyish hug
you know clyde i read about yall in the papers and im jes scared
to clyde sugar make mama stay a while yet
ignoring bonnie as does mother ebulliently even joshing now mrs
parker dont yall believe what you read in the papers
thats the law talking there
they want us to look big sos theyll look big when they catch us
he knows hes stumbled onto the wrong thing but he bounces right along its his style
and they cant do that
why im even better at runnin than robbin banks aw shoot if we done half the stuff they said we did wed be millionaires wouldnt we old sugar
he turns to bonnie who continues to stare at her mother and i wouldnt risk bonnie here just to make money uncertain as times are
why one time i knowed of a job where we could of make easy but i saw the law outside and i said to myself why bonnie could get hurt
so i just drove right on and let that money lay
he waits for a response as does bonnie
bonnies mother smiles a little abstractedly
maybe you know the way with her then
im just an old woman and i dont know nothin
she trails off looking nowhere in particular
clyde takes her reaction to mean that hes overwhelming her with his confidence and continues to pour it on
well be quittin this just as soon as the hard times is over mother parker i can tell you that
why me and bonnie were just talkin the other day and we talked about when wed settle down and get us a home and bonnie said i couldnt bear to
live mornn three miles from my precious mother
now howd you like that mother parker
bonnies mother has undergone a funny sort of transformation during clydes speech as if something had suddenly come into focus before the old womans eyes
dont believe i would
i surely dont
to bonnie you try to live three miles from me and you wont live long honey
to clyde youd best keep runnin and you know it clyde barrow
matter of fact bye baby
she hugs bonnie who can barely respond
we move in for a closeup of bonnie as her various relatives young and old come by to squeeze kiss and hug her with a chirpy little chorus of bye
bye bonnie bye bye bye
hold on the outside long enough to see the unusual structures two little motel cabins connected by two identical garages an entirely symmetrical structure
as she tries against heavy odds to file and trim her nails in a corner of the room
the odds are clyde on a uke b
buck and blanche gathered around c
who sits in the only stuffed chair in the room
raucousness is clearly shattering to bonnie who at a key moment in the scene ends up spearing her cuticle with a file spurting a little board and a lot of
clyde buck blanche c
a naked lightbulb the lampshade has been removed glares down on c
s chest where a pair of bluebirds have been tattooed with a rocco flourish
buck and blanche are vastly amused rather blanche takes delight in bucks delight
how long have ya had it
like some docile animal submitting to inspection just got it
to blanche who stares fascinated as one of c
s pectoral muscles contracts and the wings flutter touch it honey
blanche squeals with amusement
buck takes blanches hand and places it on the bluebirds
titillated with delight oh no daddy
day as the file digs into her cuticle on blanches squeal
with barely controlled rage
what are you all doin
insensitive to bonnies stare playin with my tattoo bonnie
well why dont you all go play with it somewhere else
whats bothering her
sees something coming not now blanche
who doesnt want to be victimized by bonnies temperament whats bothering her clyde
exploding i said go somewhere else
she picks up the first three objects she can find on the dresser and hurls them an ashtray a gideon bible and a flower pot at the little group
the pot goes shattering into the wall
straightening up matter of fact bonnies hungry c
i saw a chicken place a few miles back
who all wants to go get some food
rising from her chair a little shaken at bonnies outburst i sure do
im plenty tired of sittin around here anyway
not making a move to get up you cant drive honeylove
reluctantly ill go
clyde makes a face to bonnie pretending theres something going on between c
bonnie tries to keep from being amused
moves out with blanche
buck rises to go next door
whats everybody want
just five chicken dinners and get somethin for dessert
see if they got peach ice cream
he grins and pats his stomach all finally exit leaving bonnie and clyde alone
and blanche go out
we go with them
they get in the car and drive off
buck enters his cabin
clyde reaches her and for a moment both stare with fanatic intensity at each other bonnie trying desperately to keep a straight face
they are nose to nose unblinking
clyde gives her a big raspberry waggling his fingers in his ears like a kid
i hate you all
i hate yall too
no i really hate you
she turns away from him wilts onto the bed
eyes brimming oh baby ive got the blues so bad
clyde moves behind her begins to massage her back
there is something very delicate about the way he touches her it suggests clydes sensitivity to her mood rather than any degree of physical intimacy
is it your mama what your mama said
shes just an old woman now
i have no mama
bonnie rolls over on her back stares up at clyde tears splaying across her face from the move
quietly so funny
i thought when we first went out we were really goin somewhere
but this is it were just goin huh
she has addressed this last directly to clyde but there is nothing rhetorical about it it is a real question
clyde doesnt answer for a moment
then do you care about where were goin
bonnie clearly finds this hard to say not as long as you care about me
quite simply why i love you sugar
its the first time hes said it to her and bonnie is overwhelmed
she wraps her arms around clydes middle and snuggles into him like a child
neither we nor clyde can see bonnies face now and her voice is muffled by his chest
enough to die with me baby
cause i think thats where were goin
i surely do
clyde is both touched and amused by the plea
he strokes her head lightly
really meaning it
blanche her tense and agitated self growing increasingly more so lately lights a fresh cigarette off the butt of the one she has been smoking
conversationally you sure smokin all the time lately
quick to take offense snaps so what
blanche sick of it all drops her head in her hand with a sigh
looks at her finally decides to say something that occurs to him
whynt you go back home to your papa
its been her dream oh if i could
if i could just do that one thing
oh theres no tellin why this all happened
i was a preachers daughter
when church is your pa affiliated with
much more interested in talking about herself baptist
oh and he thought the world of buck my daddy did even knowing that buck was serving time in jail
he forgave him for that cause he paid his debt to society
we were disciples of christ
the camera remains stationary in this scene in this position
a lunch counter sweeps down the center of the screen
we are at one end of the counter
in the f
a deputy sits drinking coffee absorbed in his cup
in the b
at the other end of the counter by the exit door blanche and c
are being handed their order by the counterman
i aint got my money
give me some will you
the deputy turns his head and looks over there
opens his jacket to reach in his pocket for money
as he opens his coat his gun is clearly seen tucked in his pants
camera zooms in to tight close up of gun
deputy his face tense
sound of door closing shut as c
and blanche leave
to counterman get sheriff smoot on the phone
s moonlit chest and face tattooed bluebirds heaving and occasionally snoring in the night
behind him the room is dimly lit by flickering candles that are placed out of sight on the floor
the shapes in the room the bed is gutted and only the box mattress remains dresser lamp shades etc
are grotesque in the flickering light
sounds of bonnie and clyde bonnie giggling and clyde whispering something we cant quite hear
move across the room toward the gutted bed
move giggling from the floor beneath the box mattress for a moment it should appear as if something perversely sexual may be going on between bonnie and clyde
a little embarrassed aw bonnie coaxing cmon
clydes arm wielding a tommy gun clears the bed
with the muzzle clyde knocks the swivel mirror on the dresser overhead bringing bonnie and clyde into view
closer angle mirror bonnie and clyde
bonnie lies stiff as a statue on the white mattress impeccably dressed for her funeral
candelabras made of empty beer bottles lie at her head and feet
bonnies hands and face are powdered and painted a waxen white
she wears a garish silk bow in her hair which it for this occasion curled like a little girls
clyde sits up beer bottle in one hand tommy gun in the other derby hat cocked and just a little unsure of the whole thing
he takes a swig bonnie stops him trying terribly hard not to change her position
lie down now honey
ive done enough
angle on mirror bonnie and clyde
with patience to a child you have to lie down
its the only way we can tell what well look kike together
she giggles again more than a little gassed herself
clyde clamps a big cigar between his teeth and abruptly lies down beside her
clyde is both amused and annoyed
staring up at himself talking with cigar clenched between his teeth whatta you think
it suddenly strikes her thats not the right tie
rising weaving a little you cant wear polka dots on an occasion like this
well what stripes
dont go away now
she weaves her way over to the dresser takes a swig from a bottle there herself checks her makeup and returns with the tie
holding against his chest to try it out she almost falls into him
clyde steadies her
she tries to tie it for him and clearly has trouble with the knot
if were gonna do this at least i can tie it myself
lie down before you fall down
she does with some play acting exaggerated obeisance to clydes command reaching up at the last moment like a zombie and snatching an artificial flower from blanches hat which still
lies on the dresser
clyde lies down now
they look into the mirror again
this tickles clyde despite himself and he laughs bonnie begins to sing to him performing for both clyde and her own image in the mirror like some hoydenish vaudevillian
during the course of the song she will rise and take clyde with her who finally joins in when they tip toe over and begin to serenade c
to the lugubrious strains of the death march did you ever think when a hearse went by that somebody you or i may die
theyll wrap you up in a big white sheet and bury you down just about six feet the worms crawl in the worms crawl out the worms play penuckle on
your eyes fall in your teeth fall out your face turns green and the pus runs out
during this last they have been hovering over c
s twitching face like a couple of tipsy ghouls whisper singing into his ears
finally blinks doesnt even bother to look at them
im gonna die if i dont get some sleep
quit singing that
reaction bonnie and clyde
they smile go back and lie down
looking at their images all right shut your eyes now
playing along with her no you first
one for the money
two for the show
three to get ready four to go
as they approach four we should feel that somehow when they shut their eyes they really will die
they shut them on go and screen goes black
ranged across the lawn are six police cars loaded with peace officers
four men come out and guns drawn walk cautiously over to the room on the right buck and blanches
there is a knock on the door
they sit bolt upright in bed
before buck can say anything blanche puts her hand over his mouth to shut him up
calling out the men are on the other side
the four lawmen among them the deputy from the cafe edge their way across the lawn past the first garage past the second
before they reach the door of bonnie and clydes cabin the window smashes and there are blasts of gunfire
one cop is hit and falls the others run back to the cars for cover
bonnie and c
are at the window firing steadily
clyde running into the garage to get the car
they must escape
all they can do is escape and all they have is that one car in the closed garage
two of the lawmen fall to the ground shot
as the remaining two run back for cover we see a blinding light rolling up in a space between the six cars
it is an armored truck with mounted guns and and spotlight advancing toward the cabin
inside the armored truck
two men in the seat
sounds of gunshots coming from everywhere piercing light
from inside the truck we suddenly see the windshield shattered from bullets fired by bonnie and c
the driver is hit and he slumps over the wheel
his body hits the horn which starts blasting and continues throughout the battle
the other man quickly ducks under the dashboard for protection
inside the garage
clyde standing by the car
he holds the browning automatic
the garage door is shaking from the impact of bullets shattering
his gun already firing automatic clip before he gets there
clyde in a crouch runs to the garage door flings it up and runs back inside the car
now the door is open and he can get the car out
one hand on the wheel one hand shooting he rolls the car out onto the driveway
the battle is raging from all sides
the car stops
clyde keeps shooting
the door of the cabin flies open and bonnie and c
come charging out guns blazing away
fires the thompson sub machine gun bonnie fires two pistols with automatic clips
they run in a crouch tryingto get inside the car in front of their door
they make it
camera pans across the motel to the other door
it opens buck and blanche come out holding a double bed mattress in front of them for protection
this makes their running awkward the mattress is heavy
blanche carries the front end buck the back with one hand the other firing his gun
they get halfway to the car and then buck is hit shot in the head
he falls to the ground blanche and the mattress fall too since she has lost balance
both are under the mattress
clyde dashes out of the car and drags buck into the back seat
blanche follows hysterical
all guns on all sides are still firing
they fling themselves into the car and from a standing start the car starts out at mph down the driveway
one of the lawmen stands blocking the way with a double barrele rifle but the car keeps coming about to run him down
he jumps out of the way and fires at the side
the glass cracks and we see blanche fling a hand to her face which is bloody
a piece of glass has lodged in her eye
we hear her scream
the horn is still blasting
clyde manages to keep it on the road
they drive away
the police run back to their cars to give chase calling out to each other unable to believe that the gang could possibly have gotten away
as it is speeding down the highway
crazy mad hillbilly music on the soundtrack
packed inside this car right now is more sheer human misery and horror than could be believed
it is hell in there hell and suffering and pain
the car is a complete mess
everyone is hysterical
blanche is shrieking with pain and concern for buck
buck is alternating between groaning and passing out completely
bonnie is yelling at everybody to shut up
only clyde driving with both hands clenched on the wheel is silent
the car is doing
the car from the outside a half hour later
they have eluded the police
they are barreling down the road at top speed on a nice suburban street with proper homes
it is the middle of the night utter silence
clyde stops the car points to ca car in a driveway it is a beautiful shiny new and expensive automobile
runs out runs up the driveway peers inside gets in quietly backs it down the driveway and pulls behind the gangs bullet riddled getaway car
suddenly they both zoom off down the road together
he is crying mumbling wiping his eyes and nose with one hand while he controls the wheel with the other
a wide field in the country
this is dexter iowa
it is quiet
we see in a long shot that takes in everything that this is a meadow surrounded by a ring of trees a dense forest that circles them
the meadow however is large
the two cars drive into the middle of the field headlights on
they stop and the barrow gang gets out
they are in horrible shape we can finally have a look at them
half dressed in their pajamas bloody dirty in tatters
those that can stagger out do so others are carried
a far shot of all this
moving closer to them we see clyde and c
lay buck down on the ground
clyde begins to administer to his wounds as best he can mostly just wiping him off
buck is semi conscious
all are in a semi daze
blanche falls to her knees still clutching her eyes
she is totally hysterical
oh god please help us
dear father in heaven get us out of this and buck will never do another bad thing in his life
she continues moaning praying sobbing bonnie walks over to the group looking at buck c
goes over to her
two shot bonnie and c
he aint got a chance
half his head blown off
camera pulls back to take in blanche
she screams god i think im blind
in the headlights light hurts so bad
bonnie walks over to the car and comes back with the sunglasses buck had given blanche
moving her out of the glare she helps blanche put them on
bonnie now has an arm around blanche and blanche shivers into bonnie gracefully
bonnie is a little repelled by blanche but comforts her out of genuine feeling for her
clinging please please get us to a doctor
tell clyde to get us to a doctor
well die here
helping with glasses here hon
bonnie looks silently up to clyde
clyde is looking dumbly down at his mangled brother
going on clyde clyde please get us to a doctor
though blanche cannot see it clyde has knelt down to the side of buck taking bucks hand and with his other hand has begun smoothing bucks hair back away from
hes your brother
gently knowing clyde will not and cannot answer blanche buck cant be moved now hon
blanches answer to this is hysterical sobbing burying herself into bonnie mumbling half coherent muffled prayers between the sobs
with buck and clyde
right here boy
i believe i lost my shoes
maybe the dog hid em
he lapses into unconsciousness again clyde has begun to cry a little continues to smooth back bucks hair with ritualistic regularity
camera pulls away way back to wide shot of the entire field showing the group in the center of the darkness lit by the headlights
match dissolve into early dawn camera still on the wide shot
the field is lighter though the trees still loom blackly around it
the two cars one almost a shattered wreck the other bright and shiny and new are parked in the center
the sky is light but the trees cast a dark shadow on the field
the gang is just sitting around
blanche weeping next to buck c
sitting on the running board of a car staring
bonnie standing and smoking
clyde still with buck
all is quiet
from the edge of the woods a man in a white shirt emerges from behind a tree
the camera swings abruptly to get him
he calls out to the gang
it is a total surprise
bonnie clyde and c
all grab their guns and fire several shots they are not firing the big guns now but the pistols
the man lingers there for a moment he looks strange white luminous like an apparition and then he vanishes into the woods
silence long enough to make you think it was perhaps an illusion
then there is a volley of gunfire a noise so large as to be almost an impossible sound coming from the woods all around everywhere
a ring of little white puffs of smoke emerge from the woods from every tree a puff of smoke
the camera pans in a circle
behind every tree is a man with a gun
there are at least people out there peace officers farmers with hunting rifles kids with squirrel guns everyone who wanted to come along and catch bonnie and clyde
their number is so large because this time they want no possibility of the gang making what seemed by them supernatural escapes
from this point on the sound of guns is unnaturally muffled on the sound track
we hardly hear them at all
it is like a dream
without a word all of the gang including the half dead buck making his final effort scramble for the nearest car
they run throughout this battle crouched like animals their only thought to get away to escape
to fight it out would be ludicrous
from the moment the barrows start in motion there is shooting again from the edge of the woods
we see them scrambling towards the car in an extreme long shot surrounded by the ring of smoke
all of them inside
clyde is at the wheel
long shot of the car moving
the sound track goes to complete silence
we see the car looking for an avenue of escape
it veers towards a tree a man steps out from behind the tree and fires the car jerks and veers toward another tree again a man steps out and fires
and so on
the car performs its eccentric dance all in utter silence no sound of the motor nothing
the film should have the feeling of slow motion as the car swerves and loops along the edge of the woods
not once do any of the barrows fire back
another man steps out and aims
at the wheel shot in the arm
he grabs his arm in pain loses control of the wheel
out of control still silent
it smashes into a tree stump
the picture stops freezes for three beats
we hold the image of the moment of crash with pieces of metal crumpling and flying into the air suspended there by the stop film
sound partly up again but never at its realistic volume
from inside the smashed car we peer out the window across the field and see the other car
the thought strikes the audience at the same time it strikes the gang they must get to that car
shot of the second car sitting in the field shining in the sun
the lawmen also realize what must be done cut off this escape
though bonnie clyde and the others are heading toward it they suddenly train all their fire on the car rather than the gang
the car fills the frame of the screen
bullets begin to hit it
it starts to quiver under the impact
for the next minute we see the car die in front of our eyes
we see the beautiful machine fall to pieces windows smash tires torn apart body riddled
the death of the car is as painful to watch as the willful death of a human being
the execution is paced deliberately to show the ritualistic tempo of the destruction
the camera pulls back way back and slightly above everything to reveal the entire field
on the left of the screen bonnie clyde and c
are scrambling toward the edge of the woods
in the center buck and blanche have taken cover behind a fallen log
in the foreground police begin to emerge from the woods
the camera zooms rapidly in with them toward buck
blanche is screaming
dont kill him
dont kill him
buck is making a last feeble attempt
the zoom continues past buck until it comes tight on his hand a lawmans foot steps on his hand
buck falls over
dont die daddy
she goes berserk
five men one hardly a teen ager grab her and hold her as she writhes and cries
she is still wearing the sunglasses
they have reached the edge of the woods
camera tracks with them as they run
from all around come the sounds of the posse
the three get in through the pines and come finally to a deep stream
they jump in and start across running awkwardly in chest deep water
they are half way across when the police appear on the bank behind them shooting
day as she is struggling through the water
a bullet hits her in the shoulder
we must see this bullet clearly we must see it go in her flesh so that we can feel it
tight close up of bonnies face as she screams
it is the first time she has been hurt and the scream is pure animal pain
she cries out
clyde who has almost reached the other side comes back and gets her
he drags her out of the water and into a cornfield that starts growing on the opposite bank c
he half carries half runs with her into the cornfield as the field gets deeper and thicker
they stop for a second
panting to bonnie saw
saw a farm
he starts to give over the wounded bonnie to c
but clyde has not heard this last
working on pure adrenaline now he struggles onward
camera tilts up slightly so we can see clyde as he essays his way toward a farmhouse with a car in the distance
after a few moments he disappears and we can hear only the cracking of the stalks as that sound too diminishes full shot
obviously some time later
they both lie prostrate in the field listening
licks his lips
they wait for another long moment picking up only the tiniest sounds
finally oh no
as though it were the most logical thing in the world i cant die without clyde
i just cant
looks at her as if shes gone crazy
after another moment the corn begins to tremble and we hear the o
sound of an approaching car
day tentatively lifting his head up to clear the corn stalks
with him we see the car looming larger bearing down on us splitting the corn stalks
the car finally comes to a stop a few feet in front of c
bonnie is on her feet and clyde tumbles out of the car practically before its stopped sweeping bonnie into him
for a moment both are in their knees a few feet from the running board of the car simply holding onto each other and not moving
tugging at both of them frantically cmon
they have gotten away but are still escaping
he is bare chested
clyde is beside him in front his arm bleeding
he falls in and out of consciousness
bonnie is stretched out in back
her shoulder has been bandaged with c
she is unconscious
clyde comes half awake and looks over at c
head out c
determinedly im goin home to my daddys farm
is driving down the road hell for leather
nearing a campsite where there are about six okie cars and pick up trucks all loaded down with a number of poor families seated around a campfire cooking
jams on the brakes
he gets out looking totally exhausted
the faces of the okies looking at this sudden presence in their midst
back to c
about to drop can yall spare me a little water
one man the leader of the group dips a cup of water and approaches c
he comes close enough to make c
reach out for the water but withholds it from him
who are you boy
this seems to be enough for the man who gives him the water
gulps it down the man begins to circle the car peering into it suspiciously
suddenly he starts and his eyes open wide
in really hushed and reverent tones its bonnie parker and clyde barrow
he stands there struck dumb staring
those of the others who have heard him begin to come over
without a word they move quietly to the car and stare in
bonnie is out in the back seat clyde is semi conscious in the front seat
he looks up through half closed eyes
we see a woman pour a bowl of soup at the campfire and bring it to c
he accepts it
a man rolls a cigarette and lights it
then very gingerly as if afraid to really touch him he reaches through the window and places it in clydes lips
it hangs there clyde unable to drag on it or remove it
children peer through the back window
finishes his cup of soup
he hands it and the cup of water back to a woman in the crowd
quietly moving together the okies step back
walks to the drivers seat gets in and shuts the door
he starts up the car
the people push a bit closer for a last look
clyde unable to do more nods his head in a barely perceptive gesture by way of saying thank you t ot the people
the cigarette is still dangling from his lips
the car moves off
a young boy pulls on his fathers shirt
who was they pa
that was bonnie and clyde the bank robbers
a woman nearby smiles sweetly
the car pulls up outside the slightly ramshackle farm of malcolm moss c
s father in arcadia louisiana
it sits for a moment in the dark
honks the horn
a few seconds pass and the porch light comes on
old man moss comes out in his pajamas and peers into the darkness
he is a fat man with gray hair
calling back daddy
who is it
he runs down the steps down the path to his son
they greet each other hugging for a second looking each other over
god its good to see you boy
he holds c
at arms length to study him and suddenly he scowls at something he sees by the light of the porch
whats that on your chest
realizing what he means its a tattoo
im in trouble
ill tell you about it later
my friends are hurt
help me get em in
malcolm goes to car and looks inside for a moment
he walks back to c
jesus what happened to them
you in trouble son
thats clyde barrow and bonnie parker
reaction from malcolm we been shot
help me get em inside
we gotta help em
they go to the car and drag the unconscious bonnie out and begin carrying her up to the house
whyd you get yourself marked up
what in hell made you do a damn fool thing like that
they reach the house
cmon pa open the door
although the scene begins with a full screen close up of a newspaper clipping with a photo it is just a blurry gray crowded scene of blanches capture
really impossible to make anybody out in the crowd
camera stays on photo as we hear voice over of two men talking a sheriff and his deputy
i was in the bunch that took er
can you make me out
here i am see here right behind joe boyd here
sure enough billy is that your head there
camera pulls away billy a young deputy cold intense humorless and square carefully folds up the clipping and puts it in his wallet
still cant figure how we let them other two get away
an older more genial type yeah seems as how nobody can get em somehow
well maybe this boyll be the one to do it this hamer guy
boy if he cant do it sheriff aint nobody but the whole u
army can do it
with a new note of enthusiasm gets up and walks to the window turning to billy you hear he quit the rangers on account of texas got that woman governor
said he wouldnt work under no woman
respectfully yeah thats somethin all right
say how many they say he shot anyway in his day
sixty five they say
son of a sea cook
the door opens
we see full shot and then fast close up frank hamer
it should be a complete shock to the audience this is the man kidnapped by the gang earlier and partially destroyed by bonnie
hamer is dressed in his ranger outfit and hat and again he has that quality of sinister frenzy beneath his calm manner
his attitude toward these lawmen is sheer condescension friendly only out of convention really superior and contemptuous of lesser workers in his field
with politeness arising from condescension excuse me am i in the right place
is this sheriff smoot
pete and billy jump up from the chairs and walk over to hamer hands extended
they are quite impressed by meeting in the flesh
mispronouncing his name frank hammer
i sure am pleased to meet you
shakes his hand hamer
a coil of rope snaps into and through the paper splitting it and revealing c
s startled face
clyde strides the porch angrily snapping the rope
bonnie and malcolm are seated along with c
through bonnie has her arm supported by a sling and clyde has his shoulder bandagedm it is evident by clydes heady indignation and bonnies attentiveness that both are well on
the way to recovery
still snapping rope fled
what do they mean fled
how in the nama god could i leave my brother to die when he was already dead when i left him
livid he was shot in too many pieces to pick off the ground
what do they know the papers or the police
suddenly he moves upon malcolm with enormous intent as if by pounding the point home to the one relative stranger among them he will justify it all
malcolm momentarily flinches then listens with intense deference
why while we were all lyin around here near dead they had us holdin up the grand prairie national bank
they hung that one on us just for luck i guess
clyde shakes his head still thinking this over
abruptly to bonnie with deadly seriousness tell you what
soons we get well were gonna take that bank
he breaks into a wicked grin but then reels catching himself on the porch railing
hes obviously dizzy from exertion and anger
bonnie starts then sees clyde is in control
remarking on his own dizziness whooooooo boy
kneeling to bonnie they dont know nothin do they sugar
assuring him you did all you could hon
nobody coulda done more
has been studying hard on the torn paper b
how come im always called the un identified sus spect
has trouble with this last phrase
this picks up clydes spirits once more
you can just thank your lucky stars thats all you are
so longs they dont have your last name youre home safe
toadying to clyde talking to clarence mr
barrows lookin out for your interests boy
hey pa how you like havin a coupla big deals stayin with you
friendly as can be aint that somethin for me
back in good mood expansive well now you been real nice to us and i tell you what let us pay you forty dollars for your hospitality what do you
protesting vehemently no no no
i dont want your money
im just pleased to have your company
any friend of my boys
abruptly hey pa lets have supper
to clyde youre welcome here now you know that
they go into the house
camera goes with them
as soon as they are out of earshot from bonnie and clyde malcolm turns on c
displaying an entirely different demeanor from the one he presented outside
indicating tatto which flutters through c
s open shirt you look like trash boy marked up like that
protesting bonnie says it looks good
bonnie what does she know
shes just cheap trash herself
look what they do to you and you dont even get your name in the paper just pictures put on your skin by bonnie and clyde more to himself why
theyre a coupla kids
but daddy im just glad your ma aint alive to see that thing
peeks at it peering down at his chest trying to bring the bluebirds into focus puzzled
i dont see whats so bad about it
seated in a soft chair looking directly at us is blanche barrow
her eyes are completely covered with a white bandage
she wears a hospital gown
the room is white and bright
hamer in the doorway
the nurse leaves
he reaches in his pocket and pulls out a white handkerchief
he puts it over his mouth to disguise his voice afraid she will remember it from the kidnap
quietly almost on tiptoes hamer walks over to blanche
he gets inches away from her face
she still doesnt know he is there
quietly but suddenly his voice muffled by the handkerchief blanche barrow
she starts to her feet then adjusts to his presence
she is a bit panicked
blanche is now a defeated human being
her voice and manner bespeak great weariness sorrow and still a touch of her old high strung hysteria
but most of that is gone now like everything else that was really vital in her life
who is it
in a monotone a relentless questioner you know your husbands dead
her voice flat and expressionless i know
youre going to prison
i know it
wheres the rest of em
i dont know
wheres the rest of em
i just dont know
i dont know
howd you get in with them
starting slow but warming up to the subject she begins to talk and talk for the sake of airing her troubles i didnt mean to
buck said we was just goin to visit we wouldnt be doin no robbin and stealin and then we went to joplin and all of a sudden they started shootin
hysteria begins to creep into her voice as she relives it all and we run off god i was scared
and then it was run all the time and i wanted to go i begged to go but clyde and bonnie and c
seizing on it c
it is pouring rain middle of the afternoon bonnie and clyde are inside the car sitting
they have lived so much in cars that they tend to still spend much of their time in it rather than in a room
there they are themselves
bonnie is in the back seat her legs wrapped in a plaid blanket writing poetry
she looks like elizabeth barrett browning
with one essential difference her arm is in a sling and she is wearing bandages on the shoulder
clyde is in the front seat reading a newspaper
he is also partially bandaged
on the dashboard is a box of ginger snaps which he eats while he reads
they look domestic
want a ginger snap bonnie
busy absorbed no hum umm
then she realizes his nice gesture and smiles warmly at him but thanks anyway clyde
she takes it all in her situation and looks content and cozy its real nice here just the two of us like this
more interested in his paper uh huh
something in the paper catches his interest look here honey remember this
he holds up the paper there is one of the photos from the motel the one showing bonnie smoking
she looks up at it with mild interest
yeah at the motel
studying the picture you sure dont resemble that no more
close up bonnie
she has become totally fragile the essence of herself
she is writing on a pad
clyde and bonnie
what you writin this time
intensely im writing a poem about us
im writing our story
this appeals to his ego oh are you
lets hear it
if its good ill mail it in to the law and itll be printed in all the papers again
just let me finish this line
she does so
clyde munches a cookie
continuing okay here it is
bonnie as she reads intensely
at the beginning of this montage the camera remains on her face
behind her we see the rain on the window
reading the story of bonnie and clyde youve heard the story of jesse james of how he lived and died if youre still in need of something to read heres
the story of bonnie and clyde
now bonnie and clyde are the barrow gang im sure you all have read how they rob and steal and those who squeal are usually found dying or dead
they call them cold hearted killers they say they are heartless and mean but i say this with pride that i once knew clyde when he was honest and upright
but the laws fooled around kept taking him down and locking him in a cell till he said to me ill never be free so ill meet a few of
them in hell
the road was so dimly lighted there were no highway signs to guide but they made up their minds if all roads were blind they wouldnt give up till they
the manuscript is lying on the police blotter
hamer picks it up and continues reading it
he reads it in a halting way the road gets dimmer and dimmer sometimes you can hardly see but its fight man to man and do all you can for
they know they can never be free
from heartbreak some people have suffered from weariness some people have died but take it all in all our troubles are small till we get like bonnie and clyde
close up of a newspaper page
the poem is printed all the way down the length of one column
on the sound track bonnies voice picks up the recitation if a policeman is killed in dallas and they have no clue or guide if they cant find a fiend
they just wipe their slate clean and hang it on bonnie and clyde
the day is sunny and we see it through the car window
she continues reading but now she reads it directly from the newspaper if they try to act like citizens and rent them a nice little flat about the third night
theyre invited to fight by a sub guns rat tat tat
some day theyll go down together theyll bury them side by side to few itll be grief to the law a relief but its death for bonnie and clyde
bonnie finishes the poem as camera pulls back slightly to show that it is a different day different clothes and the bandages are gone
as she stops she has an expectant and somewhat self satisfied look
close up of clyde
his eyes are wide his mouth open his face shows surprise and delight and he is on the verge of a giant laugh
in gleeful wonder damn
a great laugh comes bursting from him
camera widens to take in bonnie
she is both startled and delighted by his response
continuing in that poem
continuing it is all starting to come out now his realization that he has made it that he is the stuff of legend that he is an important figure a
sub guns rat tat tat
he begins to laugh loudly right in the paper
close up bonnie
now laughing too with a great feeling of joy
bonnie and clyde
you hear bout old jesse now you goin to hear bout clyde
he puffs up with air and explodes like a steam valve
he grabs bonnie and chuckles delightedly
continuing damn bonnie
you musta been one hell of a waitress
bonnie laughing her eyes filled with tears
clydes hand wipes them away
shaking his head back and forth like a puppy just so much glee in him that he cant hold it oooooh that clyde
thats my boy that clyde
he looks at her with love and delight hugs her tightly
she hugs him back the poem of bonnie and clyde
laughing at the mistake happy the story
the story of bonnie and clyde
oh child you really did tell that story
he pulls her to him his face inches away from hers about to kiss her
she is waiting expecting
suddenly he lets out one wild laugh almost into her mouth
he kisses her
she kisses back
they are chuckling giggling
they grow more ardent they pull back and laugh again
they begin to make love
camera across the street from an ice cream parlor
sign about it evas hand packed ice cream
a large plate glass window fronts the store and through it we can see the people inside seated at tables and booths
prominent in our vision is malcolm moss seated facing camera
he is seated across from another man but we see him from the back
malcolm is obviously doing a lot of talking and then some hard listening gesticulating and looking disturbed
after a bit of this he rises from the table and begins walking toward the door
the other man rises and turns
we now see that it is frank hamer
malcolm and hamer come out onto the sidewalk squinting in the sunlight
malcolm mimes some social pleasantries by way of saying goodbye but hamers face shows no emotion of recognition of the gesture
he turns and walks away walking out of the frame
malcolm stands where he is in front of the ice cream parlor
by the expression on his face we can see that he is rather disturbed by what he has heard and that he is still grappling with the problem
bonnie and clyde
they lie where they were with one difference they are now wrapped in the blanket
clydes pants are wadded up and tangled with his shoes at the base of the blanket
chuckling apparently quite pleased damn
he casts a sidelong glance to bonnie wanting some sort of overt reaction from her
shes just smiling slightly
clydes underlying anxiety begins to surface
not looking at her hey listen bonnie how do you feel
watching him steadily her slight smile growing fine
i mean you feel like youre sposed to feel after youve uh
doesnt know what the fuck to say desperately wants her approval well thats good aint it
reason i ask is i uh
well i figger its a good idea to ask
i mean how else do i tell if i did it the way
stopping him with great warmth hey
you done just perfect
clyde looks at her for the first time tremendously relieved
he can see she means it
now his buoyancy utterly unchained breaks through i did didnt i
i mean i did i really did
i did it i did i mean this was my first time and it was just like rollin off a log when it comes right down to it it was
easy i mean i didnt even have to try
lovingly laughing altogether overwhelmed with himself clyde pulls bonnie into him
he kisses her wants to make love again but then pulls back and keeps chattering at sixty miles a minute
hes waited twenty three years to talk about this and hes got the perfect audience
there are four empty plates but only c
and malcolm in the kitchen
is scraping the bottom of a wilted evas hand packed ice cream carton
malcolm studies his sons quiet intensity in this direction for a moment then moves very close whispers when he speaks
whispering boy they expect you to go downtown with em tomorrow
out loud licking his ice cream who
raising his own voice infuriated by his sons obtuseness bonnie and clyde
he slaps the carton out of c
s hands whispering again bonnie and clyde
sure i always go with them
malcolm thinks hard about this
better go then you better go better go
to sit at table but when they get back in the car to come on home dont get in with them
genuinely puzzled why daddy
you just listen to your pa fer once
caint you do that
im yore daddy im your kin not clyde
still confused well what should i tell em
i cant get back in the car with you
malcolm is ready to kill his sons obtuseness and his fear of clyde is whipping him into a quiet frenzy
s arm no you tell them nothin hear
hesitates then i made a deal and got you off with a coupla years
a piercing treble made a deal with who daddy
malcolm hauls off and whacks c
across the top of his head with the flat of his hand then momentarily holds his hand over c
we can see his own fear the law
just dont get back in that car
eyeball to eyeball and whatever you do dont let onto them hear
suddenly smiles as if he knew something
you think them laws are gonna catch bonnie and clyde in town
returns to the ice cream carton malcolm lets him figuring he better find out what he can
what do you think clarence
matter of fact they aint gonna catch em
dont matter whether i let on or not
playing along mebbe
just you be offn the streets of that town when they go to get in their car
looking directly at malcolm nobody catches clyde
clydes got a sense dont you know that daddy
nobody catches clyde
malcolm knows better but for just a moment he stares at his son fearing that maybe c
for all his limitations has a sense about clydes sense
has finished with the carton and crumples it licking the last remnants of cream off his fingers
bonnie and clydes bedroom the middle of that night
both are wide awake lying on opposite sides of the double bed
both are staring into the night disquiet
bonnie will you marry me
there is a silent gasp from bonnie a barely perceptible stiffening
then she talks in a voice falsely formal still staring up at the ceiling
how could i do that clyde
you know its impossible
wed have to go to a justice of the peace and the justice of the peace is a lawman
we couldnt even take out a license
with a chuckle hey now you sound like you been givin it some thought on your own
with a grim irony her voice getting more and more emotional oh no i never gave it thought
i havent thought about it at least ten times a day i havent thought about it every minute of my life since i met you
suddenly her voice cracks into tears she flings herself violently across the bed and buries herself into clydes chest her knees drawn up her head tucked down into him her
body shaking with sobs
a bit startled by this attempting to hold her awkwardly and placate her
he puts his arm around her bonnie
are you crying honey
bonnie nods yes and slowly gets control over her tears
her face still buried in clydes chest she whispers clyde why do you want to marry me
clyde thinks a minute and then grins
in an attempt to be humorous to make an honest woman out of you
bonnie is silent
finally in a voice charged with anticipation and dream clyde
what would you do what would you do it some miracle happened and we could walk out tomorrow morning and start all over again clean with no record with nobody
clyde thinks about it a minute
i guess id do it all different
first off i wouldnt live in the same state where we pull our jobs
wed live in one state and stay clean there and when we wanted to take a bank wed go to another state
suddenly he realizes that he has said the worst thing he could have that it was not the answer bonnie wanted to hear
he looks down at her his voice anxious
she is silent
but she does not answer
we see malcolm jacking up the back wheel of his pickup truck which is parked on the side of the road in a wooded area
a street in arcadia
the car is parked
bonnie and clyde walks toward the car carrying big bags of groceries and supplies and put them inside
looking around what happened to c
he stopped off in that hardware store to get light bulbs for his daddy
clyde opens the door of the drivers seat and sits down
boy my feet are sweatin
he takes off his shoes
kidding around you plannin to drive with your shoes off
sure why not
he reaches in his shirt pocket and takes out his sunglasses
as he goes to put them on one of the lenses falls out
he puts them on
laughing you gonna wear em
sure drive with one eye shut
bonnie gets in the car rummages around in one of the bags and pulls out something wrapped in tissue paper
she unwraps it and puts it up on the dashboard displaying it
it is a little porcelain shepherdess holding a crook in her hand worth about thirty cents
admiring it isnt that the prettiest thing hon
just look here you can see every little fingernail on her hands
she shows him
it is a pretty thing honey
clyde turns on the radio and gets some hillbilly music
they are singing little church in the valley
he beats time on the steering wheel getting a little impatient
bonnie puts her shepherdess away and begins looking in the grocery sack
we got any peaches
i sure could go for a peach right now
she burrows in the bag and comes out with a peach
she takes a big bite
the juice drips down the side of her mouth
she looks beautiful
he stops drumming his fingers suddenly has an idea whynt we do it tomorrow
tomorrows sunday aint it
we could drive all night and be on that golf course tomorrow morning
you sure you feel up to it
enthused yeah why not
now feeling anxious and excited he is impatient to move where is that boy
hes gone too long
humming to the radio hell be here
holding the peach to him you take a bite hon
getting worried no its takin too long
what if something happened
more urgently go take a look see whats keepin him
not too delighted with the chore bonnie goes off
we remain with clyde getting anxious
the music plays on
bonnie comes back hurriedly now anxious herself
he aint there
clyde jumps into action slams his door
cmon lets go
bonnie gets in
they drive off
hiding inside a store peering out through a curtained window at them driving away
his expression is disturbed his face half in shadow
bonnie and clydes car coming down the road
camera sees from clydes p
malcolm standing in the road waving him down
the pickup truck its back jacked up is parked beside him on a shoulder of the road
i dont know
clyde reaches the spot pulls off the road and stops the car
he gets out
camera pulls back
clyde talks to the old man bonnie stays in the car
cut to a shut down the trench of the law tense
suddenly a truck loaded with chickens comes riding down the road from the opposite direction
hamer sees it from a long way away and realizes that he cannot afford to let anything pass between him and his quarry
he decides the time is now
he leaps up from the trench and yells at clyde
the old man dives under his truck to hide
the shooting starts
we see the chicken truck
two men in the front seat
they see ahead of them an incredible shooting match and in terror they jam on the brakes and leap out of the truck
they run as fast as they can into the meadow away from the trouble
the gun fight takes just seconds during which law fires eight seven shots at bonnie and clyde giving them absolutely no chance
the sound is rapid deafening
at no point in the gun fight do we see bonnie and clyde in motion
we see instead two still photographs cut into the sequence one of clyde half out of the car taking careful dead aim with his gun just as he did in
the teaching scene one of bonnie in terror a pack of cigarettes in her hand clutched tight looking as fragile and beautiful as she can be
the noise stops at once
it has been a massacre
bonnie and clyde never had a chance to return the gunfire
we see the car a complete shambles
we never see bonnie and clyde dead though for a moment we discern their bodies slumped in the car
the camera pulls above the car until it is on a level with the opposite side of the road
then slowly the six lawmen stand up in the trench
on the faces of the five deputies horror and shock at what they have just done
hamer however registers no emotion
his face is a blank
he lights a cigarette
slowly slowly the five men begin to edge closer to the car to see the result
music the wild country breakdown music begins on the sound track
before they reach the car the camera swings away from them past them and zooms out and above into the meadow where the two truck drivers are standing tiny distant
the truck drivers begin to walk toward the camera coming back to the road to see what happened
they get closer and closer to the camera until they have reached a middle distance and as they continue to walk at us it is
