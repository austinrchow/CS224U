the camera lets the ambulance go and moves to show us a shady looking building with a vertical neon sign saying hotel but only the h and the o are

kit suddenly realizes that someone is standing near her and looking down at her
she stops combing her hair and looks up
she takes her glasses off and smiles
vivian doesnt smile back at her and looks even a bit angry

edward has been taking a newspaper left by an attendant on a small table near the front door
he crosses the room and and drops the newspaper on the desk
he sits down behind the desk and starts looking through his mail while vivian walks out on the terrace
vivian voice over from the terrace wow great view
i bet you can see all the way to the ocean from out here
ill take your word for it because i dont go out there
vivian walks in the room through another french window door on the other side of the desk
she puts her bag on an armchair
why dont you go out there
im afraid of heights
edward nods his head
so how come you rented the penthouse
its the best
i looked all around for penthouses on the first floor but i cant find one
vivian takes off edwards coat and puts in on a sofa
well now that you have me here what are you going to do with me
want to know something
i dont have a clue
i hadnt exactly planned this
well do you plan everything
she takes her red jacket off
she sits down on an armchair
no im not a planner
i wouldnt say i was a planner
i would say i was hum a kind of fly by the seat of my pants girl
you know moment to moment
edward still seated behind his desk watches her with a strange look in his eyes
he suddenly realizes that perhaps he hasnt done something very wise in bringing vivian with him
you know you could pay me
thats one way to maybe break the ice
uh i assume cash is acceptable
he takes his wallet out of this jacket
cash works for me yeah
she stands up and walks to the desk
edward puts the money on the desk
she takes the money and sits on the desk
she puts the money in one of her high boots
youre on my fax
well thats one i havent been on before
she doesnt stand up but moves slightly in a very suggestive way
edward takes his fax but doesnt seem to react at vivians suggestive movements
she laughs and zips one of her boots down
out of the boot she takes several condoms wrapped in cellophane paper
here we go
i got red i got green i got yellow
im out of purple but i do have one gold circle coin left
the condom of champions

edward stands up from his desk
immediately vivian reaches for his zipper

he laughs awkwardly
why dont we just talk for a little bit okay
he takes his jacket off and puts it on the back of the desk chair
edward are you in town on uh business or pleasure

he walks away from the desk across the room
business you think
she zips her boot back up stands up and follows him across the room

edward now in his shirtsleeves but still with his necktie and his vest on has seated himself in an armchair

she sits downs on a low pouf in front of his armchair

sharp useless look about you
i bet youve known a lot of lawyers

the doorbell chimes
they both stand up

he turns around and find his face very close to vivians face and seems a little disturbed by it
might as well make myself useful
take a load off
the doorbell chimes again
vivian runs across the room to the front door and opens it
a room service male attendant comes in carrying a loaded tray
vivian closes the door behind him
uh where would you like it
where would we like it
edward has seated himself back in the armchair
uh over by the bar
the attendant seems a little surprised by vivians outfit but being a good luxury hotel attendant he pretends not to notice and carries the tray onto the bar
after he has put the tray down he turns around and almost bumps into vivian who was standing behind him
itll be on your bill mr
the attendant doesnt move away and remains close to vivian staring at her
what are you looking at
the attendant clears his throat
what is he looking at
edward walks toward the attendant and gives him some tip money

the attendant walks out of the room
edward walks to the bar

he walks back to the bar to take his own glass
my ex girlfriend jessica is in new york
moving out of my apartment even as we speak
he looks at her a bit surprised
vivian is draining her glass empty
edward comes near her with a silver bowl in his hands
in the bowl are some fresh strawberries
why dont you try a strawberry
he takes the lid off the bowl and shows it to her
it brings out the flavor in the champagne
she takes a strawberry and eats it
edward closes the bowl and brings it back on the bar
he sits down on a stool

he takes the glass off her hand
she stands up

i mean i could just pop you good and be on my way
she walks to the bar where edward is filling the glass with champagne
to tell you the truth i dont feel like being alone tonight
he gives her the glass and she immediately drinks it
he sits down on the stool

he doesnt answer immediately remains pensive for a couple of seconds and then looks at her

he points to the different forks around his plate
david seems a bit annoyed by the fact that the conversation keeps on deviating on menial subjects
