written by wes anderson roman coppola may a landing at the top of a crooked wooden staircase
there is a threadbare braided rug on the floor
there is a long wide corridor decorated with faded paintings of sailboats and battleships
the wallpapers are sun bleached and peeling at the corners except for a few newly hung strips which are clean and bright
a small easel sits stored in the corner
outside a hard rain falls drumming the roof and rattling the gutters
a ten year old boy in pajamas comes up the steps carefully eating a bowl of cereal as he walks
he is lionel
lionel slides open the door to a low cabinet under the window
he takes out a portable record player puts a disc on the turntable and sets the needle into the spinning groove
a childs voice says over the speaker in order to show you how a big symphony orchestra is put together benjamin britten has written a big piece of music which
is made up of smaller pieces that show you all the separate parts of the orchestra
as lionel listens three other children wander out of their bedrooms and down to the landing
the first is an eight year old boy in a bathrobe
he is murray
the second is a nine year old boy in white boxer shorts and a white undershirt
he is rudy
the third is a twelve year old girl in a cardigan sweater with knee high socks and brightly polished patent leather shoes
she is suzy
she carries a one month old striped kitten
the boys drop down to the floor next to their brother
they lie on their stomachs with their chins propped up on their fists listening
suzy sits in the windowsill
she opens a book called shelly and the secret universe
there is an illustration on the cover of a young gymnast with a glowing amulet around her neck
suzy starts to read then pauses
she lowers her book
she raises a pair of junior binoculars to her eyes
she looks out into the rain
a rickety three story stone and shingle house on a hillside with turrets and a widows walk
a weather vane swings creaking on the roof
tree tops sway in a cluster below
the sea is almost invisible in the misting rain and the mainland is a shadow across the sound
suzy sits in the high window watching
the family stuck indoors all day out of the rain
in bedrooms bathrooms and corridors we see the boys
they shoot marbles
they throw jacks
they play cards
they eat grilled cheese sandwiches together in the kitchen
in half open doorways we see the parents
bishop is a tall fifty year old man in madras trousers and horn rimmed glasses
he reads the newspaper and drinks coffee
bishop is a tan forty five year old woman in a lilly pulitzer type wrap around skirt
she washes her hair topless in the kitchen sink
in windows we see suzy with her binoculars
she watches wet branches shaking in the woods
she watches a man in a slicker fishing from a row boat
she watches a white colt in a field
she eats a bowl of tomato soup alone in the pantry
in the distance a seaplane flies by below the clouds
the edge of a cliff above a white beach
a rocky peninsula curls into the background
brisk wind rustles the tall grass
a fifty year old man bald on top with long hair on the sides stands next to a surveyors levelling instrument on a tripod
he wears rubber boots and a parka
he is the narrator
he speaks to the camera this is the island of new penzance
sixteen miles long
forested with old growth pine and maple
criss crossed by shallow tidal creeks
an important seabird habitat
there are no paved roads but instead many miles of intersecting foot paths and dirt trails and a ferry that runs twice daily from stone cove
the year is
we are on the far edge of black beacon sound famous for the ferocious and well documented storm which will strike from the east on the fifth of september in
three days time
a clearing in the woods with ten small khaki tents pitched in a row
a banner on a flag pole ripples in the wind
it reads camp ivanhoe
a bugler in a khaki uniform with a yellow neckerchief plays a staccato tattoo
he has a gauze patch over one eye
he is lazy eye
a thirty five year old man in the same uniform emerges through the flaps of a larger tent
he is scout master ward
he puts on a wide brimmed felt hat
a badge on the crown reads khaki scouts troop
he lights a cigarette
a thin scout with curly hair and sunglasses joins him at his side
he is gadge
gadge flips open a small spiral bound note book
scout master ward goes over to a latrine made from thick sticks and rope
a tall stooped scout digs a trench next to it with an army shovel
he is deluca
deluca stops digging
he pulls on a rope and water runs down a chute
it bursts through a valve spins a little door and a small red flag flips up
scout master ward nods
gadge makes a note
scout master ward strides away
he stops in front of a scout with long hair over his eyes sitting on a stump twisting something in his fingers
he is roosevelt
hows that lanyard coming
i dont know
i think i skipped a stitch
a small woven multi colored cord with a rabbits foot attached to the end of it
it has been braided exceedingly badly and is brutally twisted and misshapen
scout master ward studies the lanyard briefly
he looks perplexed
he pats roosevelt on the back gently and does a secret handshake with him
gadge makes a note
scout master ward strides away
an off road motorcycle races by in the background behind the tents
it jumps a mound of dirt kicks sideways in the air and revs away riding a wheelie
scout master ward frowns
scout master ward stops in front of a pile of boards and logs stacked six feet high
a thick set scout with black hair and a crooked tooth approaches with more logs in his arms
he is skotak
whats all this lumber for
were building a tree house
skotak points up
scout master ward squints
there is a small platform under construction about sixty feet above them
two scouts are sawing something in half on it
scout master ward looks astonished
thats not a safe altitude
scout master ward circles around the trunk while looking up at the tree house
he stammers whys it up so high
if somebody falls its a guaranteed death
well where would youve built it
gadge makes a note
skotak looks sheepish
scout master ward strides away
he stops in front of a very small scout with tiny eyes poking at an anthill with a stick
he appears to be contemplating pouring lighter fluid on it
he is nickleby
nickleby stands up
he looks extremely disheveled
your socks are down
your shirt tails are untucked
your trousers are not properly pressed
you are reported for uniform violation
gadge makes a note
scout master ward strides away
he stops in front of a work bench covered with newspaper where one scout sifts green powder through a funnel into cardboard tubes and another makes wax stoppers with a
they are panagle and izod
a sign on the side of the table reads no smoking
scout master ward hands his cigarette to gadge who holds it away at arms length
how many rockets you up to panagle
sixteen and a half
that enough for the jubilee
gadge shakes his head
scout master ward turns to izod
izod go fetch another pint of gun powder from the armory shed
izod dashes around the corner
scout master ward strides away
he shouts redford
the motorcycle skids to a stop in front of scout master ward engulfing him in a thick cloud of dust
he coughs and waves his arms in the air
as the smoke clears we see that the rider is a bronze all american looking boy with blond hair
he is redford
his motorcycle has flames painted on the gas tank
he tries to cover for himself safety test sir
the vehicle appears to be in good working order
im just checking if
next time i take away the keys
gadge makes a note
scout master ward strides away
he walks past a scout in a white apron cooking bacon over a charcoal grill
he is chef
chef rings a bell hanging on a post
scout master ward arrives at a long picnic table
he sits down and opens a magazine called indian corn
there is a picture on the cover of a scout troop crossing a bridge in indonesia
the first page
a caption across the top reads scout master in chief
there is a drawing of a seventy year old man on horseback
he has silver hair and a moustache
a signature below reads commander pierce
there is a quotation in large text an eagle was never hatched from a gooses egg
as scout master ward reads all the scouts begin to join him one by one
they range in age from twelve to fifteen
they unscrew the tops of tin mess kits and assemble folding utensils
the chef brings a tray of scrambled eggs to the table
the scouts serve themselves noisily
scout master ward starts to take a sip of coffee from a metal cup then stops
he looks up from his magazine
scout master ward silently reels off a list of names scanning the troop
he turns and shouts across the camp shakusky
scout master ward calls to lazy eye lazy eye
lazy eye plays another tattoo
scout master ward closes his magazine
he flicks his cigarette into a red bucket labelled fire
he picks up a strip of bacon and chews on it as he rises to his feet and walks down the row of smaller tents
the last one is sealed
at the front
scout master ward stands with his hands on his hips and says shakusky
you in there
scout master ward tugs on the tents flaps
he says to gadge its zipped from the inside
the other scouts begin to gather with their tin breakfast plates in their hands watching curiously while they eat
scout master wards voice softens sam
scout master ward looks concerned
he produces a wooden handled scout pocket knife
he unfolds a few blades and gadgets and decides quickly on a thin tool with a hook on the end
he crouches down and slips the hook through a small gap at the base of the flap twists left and right then pulls up briskly unzipping the tent
the lining of the tent is printed with images of trees and pine cones and a plaid rug covers the floor
there is a foot locker a gas lamp a chair with a folded blanket over it and an empty cot
scout master ward steps inside slowly bent over examining the space
he lifts the lid of the foot locker
he looks under the corner of the mattress
he picks up a piece of folded yellow notebook paper sticking out from under a pillow
he opens it and stares at it
he turns suddenly to the chair against the wall of the tent and slides it aside
there is neat but slightly jagged hole the size of a basketball cut through the fabric in the back corner
scout master ward looks to his staring troop
he flew the coop
a one room bungalow with a sign on the door that reads island police
there is a wood panelled station wagon parked alongside it with roller lights on the roof and a sheriffs office insignia on the door
this is the only car on the island
a dock stretches from the cottage into a small
there is a launch moored at the end of it which bobs in the rough tide
a silver airstream trailer is parked under a tree nearby
a six foot tall forty five year old man sits on a stool fishing from the side of the dock
he wears a short sleeved police uniform with a black necktie and a baseball cap
his glasses have clear plastic frames and a strap
he is captain sharp
two grouchy leathery very old men in plaid flannel and hunting caps fish alongside captain sharp
a speaker on a post emits an electric buzz
captain sharp turns
he stands up briskly and says to one of the old men watch my line edgar
a small office with a desk a file cabinet and a two way radio
captain sharp comes inside sits down grabs a microphone and presses a red button on the side of it with his thumb
this is captain sharp
scout master wards voice comes over a crackly speaker captain sharp this is randall ward over at camp ivanhoe
captain sharp pours himself a cup of coffee from a pot on a hot plate as he answers distractedly morning randy
what can i do for you
im not sure exactly
ive got an escaped khaki scout
captain sharp frowns slightly
what does that mean
one of my boys seems to have stolen a dug out and some fishing tackle ten pounds
scout master ward v
contd of sundries two bedrolls plus an air rifle and disappeared
captain sharp slowly stirs sugar into his coffee as he contemplates this
he says finally any idea why
he left me a letter of resignation
a sheet of wide ruled yellow paper which reads in a boys dear scout master ward i am very sad to inform you i can no longer be involved with
the khaki scouts of north america
the rest of the troop will probably be glad to hear this
it is not your fault
best wishes sam shakusky
captain sharp scratches his head
he checks his watch
i guess we better notify his folks
over and out
a clapboard cottage surrounded by a white picket fence
a sign on the door reads u
captains sharp station wagon is parked in the background
a young woman with her hair in a bun sits at an operators switchboard eating a sandwich wrapped in wax paper
she is becky
she wears bulky head phones with a microphone attached
captain sharp paces behind her
scout master ward flips through a stack of letters and post cards
a bell rings on the switchboard
becky plugs cords into sockets
becky i have your person to person from chesterfield
hold the line please
becky signals to captain sharp and scout master ward
they sit down quickly and put on their own sets of operator head phones
go ahead chesterfield
on one side of the frame we see captain sharp scout master ward and becky
on the other side we see a seventy five year old man with a grizzled face sitting at a kitchen table drinking coffee and smoking a cigarette while a white
haired woman ices a cake in the background
they are mr
billingsley says into his hello

scout master ward holds up a manila file card
i dont know
the manila file card
it is labelled khaki scout register
sam shakusky is typed across the top line
there is an address health information and a small faded snap shot stapled to the corner of it of a twelve year old boy standing in a sunny tobacco field
he wears his scout uniform with a davy crockett style coon skin cap
we sent him a letter
it should reach you presently
scout master ward looks quickly through his stack of letters
he stops and pulls out an air mail envelope
he stares at it
captain sharp says forcefully but highly agitated mr

billingsley hangs up the telephone
becky pulls the cords out of their sockets
captain sharp looks to scout master ward
becky opens a tin of home made chocolate chip cookies
captain sharp declines one
scout master ward tries one
he looks very impressed
scout master ward stands on a bench addressing his assembled troop
the scouts are equipped for hiking with back packs and walking sticks
you have your orders

lets find our man and bring him safely back to camp
remember this isnt just a search party its a chance to do some first class scouting
lazy eye raises his hand
scout master ward points to him

lazy eye shrugs
scout master ward frowns
you know were actually kind of in the middle of something if you didnt notice
this is a crisis
redford raises his hand
scout master ward points to him
what if he resists

no youre not
this is a non violent rescue effort
your instructions are to find him not to hurt him
under any circumstances

the scouts murmur their understanding
scout master ward nods
scout master ward wheels back to lazy eye im going to change my answer in fact
this is my real job
scout master troop
im proud of that
the scouts look impressed but slightly lost
scout master ward says finally
be leery out there
ok lets get started
skotak holds up a leash attached to a wire haired terrier
scout master ward takes a sock with a fleur de lis on it out of a paper sack
give him the scent
scout master ward hands the sock to skotak
redford deluca nickleby lazy eye and gadge at the back of the group talking under their breath while skotak waves the sock under the dogs nose i heard he ran
away because his family died
i heard he never had any family in the first place
thats probably why hes crazy
ill tell you one thing if we find him im not going to be the one who forgot to bring a weapon
the troop moves in a wide line searching through a thicket of skinny trees
redford carries a net and a giant tomahawk in a sling
deluca has a large hunting knife tucked under his belt
panagle holds a walking stick with a cluster of nails sticking out on the end of it
nickleby izod and lazy eye all wear bows and quivers of arrows strapped to their backs
the wire haired terrier strains at the end of a leash sniffing down a foot path
scout master ward speeds up the river in a small boat with an out board motor
he gives orders over a walkie talkie
captain sharp stands on the doorsteps of various big houses showing the snap shot of the missing scout to an elderly woman a house keeper a group of children a
they all shake their heads
captain sharp drives his station wagon down a beach through a field and over a bridge
captain sharp stands at the front door talking with mr
bishop holds a glass of red wine in one hand and an open bottle in the other
bishop looks slightly uneasy
they both study the snap shot
thats all the way across the other side of the island
you really think a twelve year old boy could row this far in a canoe
most likely not
with a shrug its possible counsellor
i disagree counsellor
itd take him three days at least
i dont think so
two days maximum
well im not going to argue about it
be that as it may will you let me know if you see anything unusual
a binocular shot of captain sharp from overhead as he walks away down the front steps
he passes lionel murray and rudy on their way up the path
they wear wet bathing suits and towels around their shoulders
captain sharp pats rudy on the top of his head
he dries his hand on the leg of his
he gets into his station wagon backs out of the driveway circles through the woods and drives around to a small dirt road a hundred yards behind the house
he stops the car
he gets out sits on the hood and lights a cigarette
suzy watches from the widows walk with her binoculars
she lowers them
she looks curious
she raises them back to her eyes and sees mrs
bishop from overhead as she comes out the back door of the house carrying a basket of damp laundry
she pauses at a clothesline looks left and right then walks quickly into the trees
she crosses a foot bridge and arrives at the dirt road
captain sharp stands up
they talk briefly but intensely
bishop leans against the car and stares into space
captain sharp touches her hair
bishop makes a gesture with her fingers
captain sharp hands her his cigarette
bishop takes a puff hands it back and strides away again through the woods
captain sharp gets into his station wagon and drives off
a portable night stand
there is a reel to reel tape recorder recording on it
a framed photograph next to it shows the scout master in chief posing with a troop in front of the matterhorn
the front flaps are tied open and a mosquito net is drawn
a hanging lantern flickers on a hook
a bugle plays a variation of taps in the distance
scout master ward sits on a cot dressed in pajamas
he smokes a cigarette and drinks a glass of brandy while he speaks tensely into a microphone scout masters log
first day of search party for sam shakusky
morale is extremely low in part i suppose because sam is unfortunately the least popular scout in the troop by a significant margin
im worried and im confused
please let us find him tomorrow
please dont let him fall off a cliff or drown in the goddamn lake or something
a terrible day at camp ivanhoe
lets hope tomorrows better
in fact im going to say a prayer
scout master ward presses stop
he kneels down on the floor closes his eyes presses his palms together and whispers
scout master ward zips up his tent and turns off the light
the wire haired terrier digs carefully through a pile of trash
the next morning
a fast current runs along a shallow ravine deep in the forest
the boy from the snap shot rows a mini canoe painted with native american tribal symbols and severely over loaded with boxes bags and blankets
he wears a pellet gun slung on a strap over his shoulder and his coon skin cap
he smokes a pipe
a sash across his chest is decorated with numerous small embroidered patches
there is a womans enamelled brooch pinned to his shirt
it is a jeweled black scorpion
he whistles to himself quietly as he steers under a fallen tree trunk and winds through gentle rapids
he is sam
an eddy under a willow tree
the end of the canoe is tied to a branch and the cargo is stacked on the shore
sam covers the boat with a camouflage net and dresses the top with pine needles
sam hikes through a pass wearing an extremely large back pack with stakes metal poles and two bed rolls strapped to the bottom
he wears a compass on a string around his neck
a binocular shot of sam emerging from the woods into a wide meadow
the grass comes up to his chest and flows in waves
he pauses to check his compass
he spins slowly one direction and then back the other while he stares at the dial
he looks up again
he walks onward
suzy lowers her binoculars
she stands at the end of a path cut through the high grass
she has a leather folder in one hand the portable record player in the other plus a small suitcase and her kitten in a basket at her side
sam takes his coon skin hat slowly off his head
he strides across the meadow
suzy watches him approach
her lips part
sam comes onto the path
he stops ten feet away from suzy
sam and suzy stare at each other
note suzy is slightly taller than sam
a poster box with st
jacks church across the top
a purple ink mimeographed page is stapled to a bulletin board inside under the heading summer pageant
it reads performed by the choristers of st
jack wood and new penzance dusk
a brick church at the top of a bluff overlooking the bay
it is overgrown with ivy and wisteria
there is a cemetery with a low wrought iron fence
an organ plays inside
one year earlier a play is in progress
the set includes a long ark with a sail built on a platform behind the altar
two teenagers crouched in the wings ripple a narrow blue sheet across the foot of the stage
this is meant to be water
the rest of the room is dim with tall candles flickering along the center aisle
the beams are draped with garlands
a large congregation fills every pew plus folding chairs against the walls
more people sit and stand on the steps to the choir loft at the back and in nooks and corners
the members of a brass ensemble seated beside the organist wait for their next cue following their sheet music with instruments poised
khaki scouts and scout masters occupy the rear section of the church
a very young troop in a slightly different version of the uniform fills a row near the exit
sam sits on the aisle
he looks bored
a baritone built like a linebacker in robes and a fake beard sings ominously on the stage
sam stands up and discreetly wanders toward the side door with his hands in his pockets
a slight forty year old man in the same uniform watches him from the end of the pew frowning
sam quietly entering the lobby
the sound of the music deadens as he gently shuts the door behind him
he turns around and puts on a yellow scout cap with junior khaki stitched on the bill
the room is jammed with children dressed as animals waiting nervously in a long line that
winds all around the space
they whisper and shuffle
a large woman stares through a small window into the church with her hand on a doorknob
she is mrs
she snaps her fingers suddenly without looking to the children
they fall silent
lynn swings open the center doors
music fills the room again
the first twenty of the children begin to sing
they march out of the lobby two by two
the woman closes the doors behind them and the next group takes their place to wait
sam walks slowly among otters monkeys squirrels and skunks examining their costumes periodically touching horns tusks and teeth
no one pays attention to him
he drinks a sip from a water fountain
he picks up a mint from a bowl and sucks on it
he slips out through a swinging door
sam moves down a dark corridor
he pokes his head around a corner
a rack of choir robes and cassocks blocks his path
he slides two of them apart and looks five eleven year old girls in black leotards sitting on a bench in front of a mirror framed with light bulbs
they talk quietly and fix their make up
they all wear wings on their arms and beaks on their heads
suzy sits among them in black feathers
sam stares at her
he steps into the light silently
suzy sees him in the reflection
the other girls turn around quickly covering themselves
sam removes his cap and takes another step forward
his eyes dart briefly among the other girls
he says to suzy what kind of bird are you
she looks to the girl next to her who says in a bossy voice im a sparrow shes a dove and sam does not look away from suzy as he
interrupts pointing no i said what kind of bird are you
the other girls all look to suzy
im a raven
suzy lifts her beak slightly higher on her forehead
the other girls look annoyed but transfixed
the bossy girl frowns
boys arent allowed in here
sam does not look away from suzy as he answers quietly ill be leaving soon
sam points down at suzys lap
one of her hands is wrapped in a bandage
what happened to your hand
i got hit in the mirror
howd that happen
i lost my temper at myself
sam is deeply intrigued by this
the other girls look puzzled
suzy presses her hair back off her face
she watches sam nervously
whats your name
sam nods with his eyes still glued to suzys
suzy bites her fingernails
the bossy girl rolls her eyes
its not polite to stare
sam holds up his hand for the bossy girl to stop talking
lynn steps into the doorway
lynn does a double take
she snaps at sam who are you
whered you come from
go back to your seat
he spits the mint into a trash can ducks out through the clothing rack and is gone
a skinny girl dressed as an owl watches suzy while the other girls hurry to their feet
she says quietly he likes you
troops flood out from one side of the church while children in animal costumes flood out from the other
they criss cross among grave markers and head stones
sam stops abruptly face to face with the skinny owl
she whispers something points behind her and thrusts a folded scrap of paper into sams hand
a vehicle crowded with scouts
sam sits alone in the back row
he stares into space entranced
suzy on stage at the top of a pedestal with her arms in the air spreading her wings
she is surrounded by the entire cast of singing animals
the music soars
sam as he looks down at the piece of paper in his hand
a sheet of pink stationary with an address in a girls red felt tip cursive and the words write to me
sam and suzy face each other in the wide meadow
sam says carefully were you followed
i doubt it
sam frowns and squints
did you bring a cat
sam takes a folded map out of his pocket
he signals for suzy to come closer
can you read a map
i do cartography
sam points to one of the patches on his sash
it has a protractor embroidered on it
he unfolds the map
i feel we should go halfway today and halfway tomorrow since youre a less experienced hiker and youre wearing sunday school shoes
pointing on the map heres where we are right now
id like to pitch camp here by sixteen hundred which means four oclock
how does that sound
you want some beef jerky
sam tears a strip of dried meat in two and gives half to suzy
she tries to chew on it
sam and suzy walk together down a hill across a field and through a wooded path eating beef jerky
they both smile continuously
are you thirsty
well if your throat gets parched stick a pebble in your mouth and suck on it
you can quench your thirst with the spit supposedly
sam shows suzy some bits of green and yellow sticking out from under his coonskin cap
sometimes i stick leaves under my hat
it cools your head down
thats a good idea
it might help also if you didnt wear fur
true but this adds camouflage
sam stands in a clearing and pulls a handful of dry grass
he holds it in his fist
heres a trick
throw grass in the air and you can see which direction the winds blowing
sam throws up the grass
it swirls and drifts vaguely
i guess it doesnt really matter as long as we cover our tracks
sam and suzy stop to investigate and discuss a patch of mushrooms moss on a stump ferns poison ivy and a low bush with purple fruit
sam looks skeptical
these might be poisonous
no theyre huckleberries in fact
suzy brushes off some dirt and eats a berry
sam puts one into his mouth and nods
anyway theyre good for survival
sam and suzy look through suzys binoculars at a deer drinking from a stream
suzy whispers he knows someones watching him
why do you say that
i dont know
i just think he can feel us
sam and suzy walk across a fallen tree over a stream
a snake swims on the surface below them
sam assists suzy onto the far bank
you smell like perfume
its my mothers
sam picks up two pebbles
he and suzy both put them in their mouths
they click against their teeth
i brought water too
sam and suzy watch a small green worm wriggling in the air swaying from a silk thread
they stare wide eyed
suzy cups her hand a few inches below it and moves it around in a circle
should we catch him
we need worms
the worm curls and uncurls itself gently
well let him live
maybe ive got a licorice whip
the banks of a large pond
all of sams and suzys bags boxes and suitcases are arranged around a small tent decorated with more tribal symbols
the kitten is asleep
sam and suzy stand at the waters edge as he removes the camouflage net from the canoe and says gravely how strong of a swimmer are you
i broke our school record for the back stroke
well im not that strong of a swimmer so i wear a life preserver
i think its a good policy to get in the habit anyway
sam and suzy both strap on vests belted with cork blocks
a strip of bright red licorice on a hook under water
sam and suzy in the middle of the lake
suzy sits at one end of the canoe fishing with a bamboo pole
sam drapes his fingers off the side and stirs the water
watch out for turtles
theyll bite you if you put your fingers in their mouths
let me see if i can catch this one
sam dips a net into the lake and brings it up with a small turtle in it
he lifts it out of the net
it has red and yellow markings and a slightly damaged shell
sam flips it over
the word albert is written on the underside of the turtle in magic marker
sam says blankly somebody wrote on him
the fishing pole jerks in suzys hands
she yells the sticks moving
you got one
sam jumps to his feet and heaves the turtle with two hands
it sails through the air across the pond and splashes down with a whack
sam yells an announcement fish on hook
reel him in
the canoe rocks violently
suzy snaps sit down
sam sits back down
suzy winds the reel carefully
sam says youre doing good
sam points to one of the patches on his sash
it has a rod and reel embroidered on it
this is for fishing
sam twists a stick with a shoelace in kindling and builds a small camp fire circled with rocks
he cooks two fish with bologna in a frying pan over a camp fire
he throws in a dash of salt grinds some pepper and flips the fish in the air
he holds out a bite on a spatula to suzy sitting on a log next to him
she tastes it
she looks surprised and nods very good
you know a lot about camping dont you
im a khaki scout
its what im trained for
sam points to one of the patches on his sash
it has fried eggs and bacon on it
anyway i used to be
sam serves the fish onto two tin plates
he says as they eat with folding forks we can feed your cat the guts and eyeballs
sam points to a pile of bloody organs and bones on a page of newspaper
he only eats cat food
suzy points to a cardboard box
sam looks inside
it is filled with ten cans of cat food
sam raises an eyebrow
what else did you bring
we should make an inventory
sam flips open a small spiral bound note book
suzy opens the top of her portable record player
she displays it like a salesman
this is my record player
it works with batteries
actually it belongs to my little brother lionel
i left him a note
do you like music
sam nods and makes a note
suzy opens her leather folder
there are three l
records in it
she takes out one by a french singer
this is my favorite record album
my godmother gave it to me for my birthday
she lives in france
sam nods and makes another note
suzy opens her suitcase
it is filled to the brim with hard back copies of fantasy books
it contains no other items of any kind including clothing
these are my books
i like stories with magic powers in them
either in kingdoms on earth or on foreign planets
also time travel if they make it realistic
usually i prefer a girl hero but not always
i couldnt bring all of them because it got too heavy
you can borrow any you want
sam nods and makes another note
suzy produces a few more i also brought my lefty scissors because im left handed my toothbrush some rubber bands extra batteries and my binoculars as you know
i forgot my comb
sam surveys the entire collection of articles
he scratches his head
no mess kit
no waterproof matches
didnt you get the packing list i sent you in my last letter
i thought thats what youre supposed to bring
i dont own a canteen
we can share
sam picks up one of the books
it is called the girl from jupiter
there is an illustration on the cover of a young alien princess with glittering tears on her cheeks
sam examines the other books in the suitcase
he looks slightly puzzled
these are all library books
in my school youre only allowed to check out one at a time
some of these are going to be overdue
he suddenly realizes something
he asks do you steal
suzy nods reluctantly
sam looks confused
youre not poor
suzy stares at the books
she absently brushes some dust off them
she rearranges them slightly
she says finally i might turn some of them back in one day
i havent decided yet
i know its bad
i think i just took them to have a secret to keep
anyway for some reason it makes me feel in a better mood sometimes
sam thinks about this
he leans his chin against his fist
he are you depressed
suzy bites her fingernails
suzy says philosophically well i can show you an example if you want but it doesnt make me feel very good
i found this on top of our refrigerator
suzy looks into her leather folder and shuffles through some pages
she withdraws a small pamphlet
the cover of the pamphlet
there is a drawing of a broken tea cup and the title coping with the very troubled child
his eyes widen
does that mean you
sam explodes with laughter
its not funny
to me it is
sam slaps his knee and shakes his head
suzy dumps her fish into the campfire and throws her metal plate like a frisbee into a tree trunk
it bounces off with a ding
she stands up and says coolly you really know how to make friends
suzy walks away
she goes behind a bush and sits down on a rock
she starts to cry
sam looks stricken and confused
he is very still
he gets up slowly
he tentatively approaches the bush
he looks behind it
he takes two steps closer
he stands above suzy
he unties his neckerchief crouches down and holds it out
suzy looks to sam
she takes the neckerchief
im on your side
suzy dries her eyes
she unfolds the neckerchief and studies its design
it is a brave shooting an arrow while leaning off the side of a galloping horse
sam motions to the books which ones the best
sam lies on his back on one of the bedrolls smoking his pipe while suzy sits indian style next to him
she reads aloud from a book called the francine odyssies
there is an illustration on the cover of an enormous panther with a bloody sword walking behind a small girl in a nightgown
his eyes downcast his kingdom in ruins mynar pressed his heavy paw through the rippling surface of the cool shallows and down to its stone floor
my people once were lead by a great and noble beast and i no longer see his face in this reflection
suzy looks to sam
he is asleep
she takes the pipe out of his mouth and tips the ashes into the camp fire
she draws a blanket over his chest
she continues meanwhile on the plains of tabitha francine rested
there would be another time for war
the dining room
there is a long wide empty table with sixteen chairs around it
tucked in the corner lionel murray and rudy sit at a folding card table
they have plates on place mats and forks and knives
there is one extra seat
bishops voice booms amplified from the next suzy
im not going to say it again
bishop charges into the room with a steaming casserole
she wears an oven mitt on one hand and carries an electric megaphone in the other
she sets the casserole on the card table and looks out the window
through the thicket
of trees behind the house a pair of headlights blinks
bishop checks her watch
she says sharply wheres your sister
i dont know but she borrowed my record player for ten days without asking
what does that mean
lionel holds up a small folded up piece of pink stationary
bishop snaps it out of his hand and opens it
a short note on pink stationary in a girls red felt tip cursive
it reads dear lionel i need to use your record player
i will give it back in ten days or less
do not tell mom
i will replace the batteries when i return
signed suzy bishop mrs
she bolts back out of the room
her voice walt
where the hell are you
there is a loud thump upstairs
bishop shouts from right here
why are you cursing at me
bishop leans out of an upstairs window
bishop appears in one below
she yells up through the does it concern you that your daughters just run away from home
thats a loaded question
bishop brandishes the note with her free hand
come down and read this
a radio squawks in the woods behind the house
bishop turn quickly toward the sound
bishop looks tense
beckys garbled voice says over a tinny speaker scout master ward confirms theyve had no luck
theyre going home for the there is a rustling and the sound of a car door opening then the radio cuts off
he shouts whos there
captain sharp emerges slowly from the dark tangled in a bramble hopping slowly on one foot as he unwinds a root from around his ankle
he smiles awkwardly and says good evening
sorry to startle you
i was what are you doing here
nobody called the police
i know thats what im saying
the search partys not over yet
in other suzys missing too
go find her
whered she wait for me
bishop disappears into the house
captain sharp and mrs
bishop exchange an uncertain look
captain sharp pans a spot light back and forth in the darkness while he steers the car
the lamp has a short in it
and flickers with each bump
bishop rides in the passenger seat
he stares ahead down the road and says to how can we help her
shes got so many problems
its getting worse
bishop looks strangely to captain sharp
he asks whose fault is it
i dont know but just for the record ninety five percent of all runaways return home within six hours
that doesnt do you any good right now
its just a statistic but in all likelihood suzys probably hiding in the closet at her best friends house playing chinese checkers at this very moment as we speak
she doesnt have any friends
bishop i mean
i dont understand
is she upset
bishop looks baffled and disgusted
he throws his hands into the air
he looks away and shakes his head
captain sharp wiggles some wires
i got to get this spot light fixed
captain sharp and mr
bishop come to a stop and get out of the station wagon
they look dejected
the screen door bangs open and mrs
bishop quickly descends the front steps with a open shoebox full of letters in her hands
she says breathlessly shouting she has a pen pal
its very intimate
they planned this together
captain sharp takes one of the letters and studies it
he says to himself sam shakusky
thats my escaped khaki scout
his family died
bishop takes a handful of the letters and flips through them
he stops suddenly
he looks horrified
what am i looking at
a small painting on construction paper of a naked girl stepping into a bathtub
she wears a flower in her hair
bishop continues to shout as she explains he does watercolors
mostly landscapes but a few nudes
lionel murray and rudy watch from a downstairs window
lionel takes a bite from a bowl of melting ice cream
bishop stares at the painting
he squints at it and asks she sit for this
captain sharp and mrs
bishop look over mr
captain sharp says calmly what does he say
the history of sam and suzys correspondence
sam dressed in a greasy jump suit writes at a work bench in a garage while six teenagers take apart carburetors behind him
they are his foster brothers
sam reads in voice over dear suzy you have a superb voice
you were my favorite animal in the program by far
please find enclosed suzy writes at a small desk on the upstairs landing while lionel and murray play a loud duet on a red piano behind her
rudy turns the pages of the sheet music
suzy reads in dear sam thank you very much
i got replaced as the raven because i yelled at mrs
after that i was only a blue jay but sam works in an alley emptying garbage from several small trash cans into a larger one
billingsley watches television in a window smoking a cigarette
he points to a crumpled wrapper on the ground
sam picks it up
dear suzy i am sorry your brothers are so selfish
maybe they will grow out of it
sometimes people do things without knowing the reasons for suzy reads a book called disappearance of the th grade
there is an illustration on the cover of a school teacher levitating at the front of her classroom
there are several watercolor pictures taped to the wall behind her
most are landscapes of small town vacant lots
one is a swimming girl in a bikini
dear sam you are an excellent painter especially trees and telephone poles
is the girl in the water supposed to be me
my favorite color is sam stands in pajamas staring blankly eyes wide at a dog house in flames next to a rusty swing set
a dachsund sits next to him also watching
billingsley comes running out of the house with a fire extinguisher
dear suzy i accidentally built a fire while i was sleep walking
i have no memory of this but my foster parents think i am lying
unfortunately it is
suzy stands in the kitchen looking out through a pane of glass with a hole smashed in the middle of it
bishop is next to her with her hair hanging over the sink while the two of them carefully pick bits of glass out of it
dear sam i am in trouble again because i threw a rock through the window
my mother still has glass in her hair
also five of sams foster brothers watch calmly as the sixth throws sam against the wall then jumps on top of him pinning his arms to the floor while sam
dear suzy i have been trying very hard to make friends but i feel people do not like my personality
in fact i can understand why they might a classroom of sixth graders watches in a panic as suzy throttles one of her classmates
the classmate flails and grimaces as she is strangled
dear sam now i am getting suspended because i got in a fight with molly
she says i go berserk
our principal is against me
why do sam does sit ups on a hard mattress in a basement room lined with bunks
he counts out the repetitions under his breath
there is a small black and white photograph of a man and woman at their wedding tacked to the wall above him
dear suzy i know your parents hurt your feelings but they still love you
that is more important
if they suzy stands in a doorway screaming at her family while they watch wearily from the dinner table with forks and knives in their hands
dear sam i do think you should think of their faces every day even if it makes you sad
it is too bad they did not leave you more pictures of themselves
can you sam writes in his bunk crouched beneath a blanket with a khaki scout flashlight pointed at his paper
dear suzy here is my plan
suzy writes in her bed crouched beneath a quilt with a plastic lantern glowing beside her
dear sam my answer is yes
a sheet of wide ruled yellow paper which reads in a boys dear suzy when
a sheet of pink stationary which reads in a girls red felt dear sam where
suzy kneeling in the dark crouched in front of an upper window with the shoebox of letters beside her
outside the woods are black beyond a moonlit field
dear suzy walk four hundred yards due north from your house to the dirt path which has not got any name on it
turn right and follow to the end
suzy raises her binoculars to her eyes
i will meet you in the meadow
the next morning
the end of the path cut through the high grass where sam and suzy met the day before
captain sharp scout master ward mrs
bishop and becky stand in two groups talking
gadge and skotak stretch a string with ribbons tied to it from stake to stake marking a perimeter
lazy eye walks with the wire haired terrier pulling at its leash
other scouts search the field and scan the horizon
captain sharps station wagon and redfords motorcycle are parked in the dirt
bishop stands off to the side by himself poking at the ground with a stick
he has two black eyes and half his face is swollen and purple
scout master ward asks becky quietly what happened to him
im not sure
i think he went searching in the dark
bishop says loudly without looking up from the ground she stole the batteries out of my flashlight
scout master ward looks at becky and grimaces
becky raises an eyebrow
bishop stands next to captain sharp
they move slightly away from the others
captain sharp whispers quickly almost inaudibly i think hes onto us
of course he is
captain sharp looks surprised and defensive
he whispers of course he is
of course he is
why arent we worried about that then
well i didnt know
or anyway i thought i was wrong
did you hit him
he fell in a ditch
nickleby pops up from below the tall grass and thrusts an empty can of cat food into the air
he shouts excitedly cat food
i think its a clue
the group quickly gathers around nickleby
bishop snatches the can out of his hand and examines it
he says thats her
bishop throws the can away over his shoulder and walks off with his hands in his pockets
nickleby runs after the can and picks it up again
bishop continues down the hill
scout master ward watches him
he asks mrs
bishop wheres he going
i dont know
bishop follows mr
captain sharp turns to the rest of the group and says briskly all right
we know theyre together
we know theyre within a certain radius of this spot
im declaring the case with the county right now
until help arrives captain sharp looks to scout master ward as he points to various scouts and divides the group into teams im deputizing the little guy the skinny one
and the kid with the curly hair to come with me in the station wagon
randy you drop in and head up river with the rest of your troop then split up on foot
becky call jed and tell him to circle over this end of the island and fly low
a binocular shot of the seaplane flying in a pattern
it banks sharply
the binocular shot tilts down
far below in the distance captain sharps station wagon rumbles along a dirt road through the woods
the binocular shot pans wide
on the side of the river scout master wards motorboat stops
two scouts tiny figures pull the camouflage net off the hidden canoe
suzy watches through her binoculars while sam crouches beside her
they are hidden behind a pile of rocks
suzy says they found the canoe
angry at himself rats
i shouldve put more pine needles on it
were almost there
sam lifts his backpack onto his back and slings his air rifle over his arm
suzy picks up her suitcases and puts the kitten on her shoulder
they walk down a narrow path through a thicket
they emerge into a small clearing
sam and suzy stop in their tracks
deluca nickleby panagle izod and lazy eye stand in a row along the edge of the woods ahead of them
deluca brandishes his hunting knife
nickleby izod and lazy eye point their bows and arrows
panagle holds his walking stick weapon
the wire haired terrier strains growling at the end of his leash
deluca jerks him back
the kitten cowers
the sound of a motorcycle guns and redford bursts through the trees pops a wheelie and skids to a stop
he lifts his goggles
the motor idles
sam says finally what do you creeps want
redford shrugs and answers with a callous smile were looking for you
because youre a fugitive
no im not
didnt you get my letter of resignation
i quit the khaki scouts
youre still in uniform
sam quickly takes off his shirt and throws it aside
well it doesnt matter anyway
you dont have that authority
weve been deputized
now are you going to come along peacefully or not
sam takes a deep breath
he pleads listen to some reason i dont like you
you dont like me
why dont you stupid idiots just let us disappear
its tempting but i cant allow it
deluca spits on the ground
he says to suzy you shouldnt be friends with him
because hes crazy
maybe you just dont know him
we know him a lot better than you
hes emotionally disturbed because his family died
nickleby tie him up
nickleby takes a step forward with his bow and arrow pointed and ready
suzy looks furious
sam flips his air rifle off his shoulder with a twirl
he points it at redford and nickleby
sam says darkly do not cross this stick
sam motions to a twig on the ground in front of him
youre doomed shakusky
redford revs the motor pops the clutch and races across the clearing toward sam and suzy
the rest of the troop converges yelling crazily
the wide canyon echoing with shouts screams and a small explosion
one by one deluca nickleby panagle izod and lazy eye come running out of the trees and down the hill
finally redford hobbles after them limping and groaning and clutching his side
redfords charred partially demolished motorcycle smoldering in the branches of a tree
suzy stands on the edge of the ravine staring at the pair of bloody scissors in her hand
she looks shaken
sam takes the scissors cleans them with his fingers and hands them back to suzy
he says gently it was him or us
she turns slowly away
her eyes widen
the wire haired terrier lies on his back on the ground with an arrow sticking out between his shoulder blades
the kitten licks at the wound
sam and suzy run over to the wounded dog
sam crouches down gently presses the kitten away and says bleakly they got snoopy through the neck
suzy has tears in her eyes
she slides her hands under the wire haired terriers body
she begins to hyperventilate as he needs a doctor
sam puts his finger to the wire haired terriers neck
he no he doesnt
he needs a morgue
trying to catch her breath hes losing blood
where do we go
suzy lifts the bleeding dog into her arms
sam grabs her by the shoulders
he locks eyes with her and says with grit and suzy
look at me
snoopys not going to make it
starting to cry dont say that
theyre after us
we got to move
raising her voice hes dying
we cant just leave him
its too late
hes already gone
stop yelling at me
sam slaps suzy in the face
she falls silent
he says slowly im sorry i had to do that but youre panicking
the first rule in any emergency is you never suzy drops the wire haired terrier which hits the ground with a thud
she slaps sam back with a huge roundhouse smack
sam falls over sideways
suzy stands over him
dont ever do that again
no ones allowed to slap me
sam stands up and dusts himself off
he and suzy stare down at the lifeless animal
suzy says quietly youre right
sam reaches into a side picket of his back pack and takes out an army shovel
he assembles it
suzy says hopefully
was he a good dog
he says distantly even cosmically whos to say but he didnt deserve to die
suzy slowly wraps her arm around sams shoulder
they squeeze each other tightly
he begins to dig
captain sharp speeds bouncing down a winding dirt road
lazy eye deluca and gadge sit next to him crowded into the passenger seat
lazy eye yells into the hand set of the she stabbed redford in the back with lefty scissors
a voice responds over the speaker repeat that please
captain sharp grabs the hand set out of lazy eyes hand
he shouts into it puncture wound
make room for a stretcher in the cockpit
redford is lying on his stomach on a towel in the rear of the vehicle
scout master ward kneels next to him pressing his hand firmly into the middle of his back
there is significant blood
redford moans loudly
scout master ward reassures him youre going to be ok
thank goodness she missed the artery
bite on this
scout master ward puts a pencil in redfords teeth
redford grimaces crunching it
in the back seat the rest of the troop excitedly re cap i tried to chop him but he dodged my tomahawk
who else got hit
i ran away when the girl went berserk
hes got great marksmanship
he shot deluca in both arms
skotak points to the front seat
deluca sits glumly in silence
he has numerous small welts all over his arms
gadge wheres snoopy
captain sharps station wagon skids to a stop next to his office while the seaplane pulls up to the dock as mr
bishop approach pedalling furiously on bicycles
bishop wears boating shoes
captain sharp and scout master ward jump out of the car
skotak and gadge help them remove redford on a stretcher from the back of the station wagon
bishop struggles with his kick stand
he shouts what happened

captain sharp motions for the two old fishermen to get out of the way
he and scout master ward run with the stretcher onto the dock
bishop is frantic is suzy with you

gadge points toward the hills
a man wearing a jumpsuit and aviator sunglasses stands next to the seaplane
he is jed
he shouts as the stretcher approaches wherem i going
the infirmary at fort lebanon
well be right behind you
captain sharp motions for skotak gadge and lazy eye to help jed load the stretcher into the small cockpit
he tosses a set of keys to scout master ward and says warm up the motor

scout master ward takes the keys and starts untying the police launch
captain sharp heads toward his office
bishop says firmly hold it right there

bishop wheels on scout master ward
he explodes why cant you control your scouts
scout master ward recoils
he says quietly troubled im trying
bishop takes off his shoe and throws it at scout master ward
scout master ward ducks and the shoe bounces off his back
captain sharp blocks mr
bishop scuffles with captain sharp
bishop jerks him backwards and shouts stop it walt
bishop faces mrs
bishop and captain sharp breathing heavily
scout master ward looks depressed
jed gadge skotak and redford watch frozen from a gangplank alongside the seaplane
i do blame him pointing to scout master ward but i also blame myself and both of you
with all due respect you cant let your children stab people

shes violent mrs
scout master ward shows mrs
bishop the blood all over his hands and uniform
bishop looks confused

captain sharp gently draws mrs
bishop away by the shoulder
he links arms with her as he tries to placate the group easy does it
calm down laura

bishop pushes captain sharp away from mrs
bishop into scout master ward
scout master ward lunges at mr
bishop but is intercepted by captain sharp and mrs
they shout dammit
at this moment a voice interjects from the shore
excuse me captain sharp
captain sharp scout master ward and mr
bishop stop fighting and turn around at once
they see the narrator
he stands at the foot of the dock holding a journal with rubber bands wrapped around it
they all stare at him blankly
he continues as some of you know i taught sam for the cartography accomplishment patch
hes a smart boy and he expressed a keen interest in the history of the islands indigenous peoples
in particular i recall his fascination with the idea of retracing the original path of the old chickchaw harvest migration
everyone looks utterly perplexed
the propeller of the seaplane starts up and they all shield their eyes from the blast of wind and dust
the narrator hesitates
he yells over the noise what im getting at is this i think i know where theyre going
the narrator removes the rubber bands from his journal
a carefully hand drafted nautical chart
a cove is marked with a red arrow and the caption mile
the portable record player
suzys fingers place the needle onto a spinning disc
a small cove enclosed by a low rocky cliff
it forms an almost complete circle and is overgrown with vines flowers and branches
a thin channel leads out to the ocean
the sand on the shore is white and the water is perfectly clear and crowded with shells at the bottom
birds echo and fly from tree to tree
sams and suzys luggage is piled on the beach
the kitten wanders exploring
the lid of the portable record player is open
the voice of leonard bernstein says over the speaker
onto the bird house where every kind of bird imaginable is whirling and wheeling around
this is a real acrobatic act for our gifted young flute player paula robeson
as they listen sam and suzy take off their shoes and socks and run in opposite directions around the edge of the cove
they each climb up a rock over the water
they look at each other across the lagoon
they both laugh
suzy shouts this is weird
sam takes off his coon skin cap and throws it aside
suzy removes her cardigan and drops it on the ground
sam strips off his uniform down to his white briefs
suzy take off everything except her underwear and a training bra
they throw their clothes into the water
sam yells on three
suzy immediately counts very quickly
they both scream as they leap into the water
they swim toward each other laughing and shouting
a clothesline hung with sams and suzys wet clothes swaying like flags and snapping in the wind
the tent has been pitched on a low sandy plateau close to the water
two lines of shells mark a path to the entrance
a long stick is jammed into the ground with a flickering safety candle stuck into the y at the top
the kitten is asleep
sam sits on a folding stool in front of a portable easel
he dips his brush into a tin cup and paints
suzy poses stretched out and propped up on one arm
she adjusts herself slightly
i like it here but i dont like the name
its got no ring to it
lets change it
what should it be
let me think for a minute
sam continues to paint while suzy thinks
a binocular shot of a deep blue star filled sky
suzy lies on her back on a flat rock in the middle of the cove looking up into the night
sam wades out to her and climbs up beside her
i made you some jewelry
sam holds up two dead shimmering opalescent beetles with fish hooks threaded into their shells
suzy looks enchanted
are your ears pierced
inside the tent lit by a lantern
sam clenches his teeth as he forces one of the fish hooks through suzys earlobe
suzy screams murderously
sam releases her
the beetle dangles neatly
a line of blood runs down the side of suzys neck
sam holds up a little mirror
do the other one
sam switches to suzys other earlobe
she resumes her screaming
sam and suzy standing on the beach listening to the french singers record
they face each other bobbing their heads and tilting awkwardly to the music
suzy eventually begins to dance
sam does something vaguely like the twist
they press against each other and kiss
suzy says quietly it feels hard
do you mind
i like it
tilt your head sideways
sam and suzy kiss again
sam pushes his hands through suzys hair and draws it back behind her ears
suzy whispers you can touch my chest
sam slides his hand up under the training bra and presses it onto suzys breast
theyre going to grow more
he looks to be in a trance
sam and suzy sitting on a tree branch over the water eating raisins from sams hand
suzy has flowers in her hair
she looks down into the water with her binoculars
why do you always use binoculars
suzy thinks for minute
she says finally it helps me see things closer
even if theyre not very far away
i pretend its my magic power
that sounds like poetry
poems dont always have to rhyme you know
theyre just supposed to be creative
suzy gives sam the binoculars
he points them at her and stares
what do you want to be
when you grow up
i dont know
i want to go on adventures i think
not get stuck in one place
how about you
go on adventures too
not get stuck too
i guess that sounds almost like im just repeating what you just said but i couldnt think of anything as good as it
on the other hand maybe well get blown up by an atom bomb
you cant predict the exact future
its possible i may wet the bed by the way
later i mean
i wish i didnt have to mention it but just in case
i dont want to make you be offended
of course i wont
some people frown on these problems
she holds sams hand
she points to the scorpion brooch pinned to sams shirt
whats that one for
sam looks at the brooch
he shakes his head
its not an accomplishment
i inherited it from my mother
its actually not meant for a male to wear but i dont give a damn
suzy nods thoughtfully
are your foster parents still mad at you
for getting in trouble so much
i dont think so
were getting to know each other better
i feel like im in a family now
not like yours but similar to one
i always wished i was an orphan
most of my favorite characters are
i think your lives are more special
tears suddenly well up in his eyes
he shakes his head
i love you but you dont know what youre talking about
suzy says genuinely i love you too
a campfire burns in front of the tent
sam lies on his back on one of the bedrolls smoking his pipe while suzy sits indian style next to him
she reads aloud from a book called the light of seven matchsticks
there is an illustration on the cover of a childs hand extinguishing a little flame
a ribbon of smoke curls between its fingers
the flashlights beam drew a moon through the black across the attic and settled on a gap in the base board
a mouse hole no bigger than a pocket watch
eric crouched on his flat feet and placed his hand in front of the tiny opening
its windy he said
like someone in theres blowing on my fingers
christy rolled her eyes and sighed a sigh
hes right again she thought
little brothers drive people crazy
suzy looks to sam to see if he is still awake
sam nods and signals for suzy to continue
suzy turns the page and reads
the next morning
sam and suzy are asleep with their arms wrapped around each other inside the tent
they wear only their underwear
the sound of an airplane approaches
sams eyes open
the noise buzzes by loudly overhead
suzy sits up
sam scrambles to his feet unzips the flaps of the tent and looks out
suzy crouches beside him holding onto his leg
captain sharp standing on the beach fifteen feet away
scout master ward waits behind him with gadge skotak and lazy eye
bishop stride up out of the water
bishop looks incensed
they are wet to the waist
the police launch is moored in the lagoon
two larger boats with st
jack wood fire brigade printed on their hulls float further away
men in red caps stand on their decks
suzy pulls sam back inside
she zips up the tent again
she kisses sam
bishop hollers suzy
get out here
bishop grabs hold of the entire tent by the top and rips it up out of the ground uprooting the stakes which go flying
this reveals sam and suzy half naked entwined kissing
bishop both freeze
sam and suzy look up to them
bishop growls and roars at them ferociously like a monster
sam and suzy look horrified
bishops face suddenly drains of all emotion
bishop commands sam and suzy put your clothes on
both of you
sam and suzy remain perfectly still
bishop grabs suzy by the arm and jerks her to her feet
sam and suzy hang onto each other
bishop slaps suzy with a whack
sam lets go and suzy is gone
scout master ward comes over to sam sadly and hands him his uniform
sam takes it
scout master ward turns to the other scouts claps his hands twice and says
strike this camp
sam starts putting on his socks
captain sharp watches him
captain sharp drives his boat along the coast with a grim look on his face
suzy rides in the back with mr
sam rides in the front with the other scouts
an interrogation is in progress how long were you planning to stay there
i dont know
you said ten days or less
that was a lie
didnt you ever think about what would happen next
not to my recollection
youre a traitor to our family
i want to be
scout master ward sits next to captain sharp
he shows him the air mail envelope
what do i do about this
captain sharp shrugs
he says resigned give him his mail
scout master ward turns to sam
he holds out the envelope
sam takes it
he opens it
suzy watches him from across the boat
she calls out anxiously what does it say
they cant invite me back
i gave them too much aggravation
suzy stands up
she says as she starts across the boat let me read it
sam holds out the note
bishop pulls suzy back down to her seat
he stands up himself and walks over to sam
he takes him by the wrist and leads him to a small cabin
he opens the door and presses him forward
sam stumbles down the steps and looks back
bishop shuts the door
captain sharp glares at him
suzy says icily thats child abuse
bishop returns to the back of the boat and sits down again
he gives suzy a direct order be advised the two of you will never see each other again
those were your last words
do you understand
id be careful if i were you
one of these days somebodys going to be pushed too far and who knows what theyre capable of
is that a threat
its a warning
suzy looks from captain sharp to mrs
bishop and back to mr
bishop falls silent
i wish i knew what makes you tick
i beg your pardon
please terminate this conversation
shes saying that to me
lionel shakes his head bitterly
suzy stares out to sea
scout master ward walks over to the cabin opens the door and goes inside
a small room with two bunks two portholes and a pile of ropes
sam sits hunched over with his hands in his lap
he stares at the envelope
scout master ward sits down across from him
he motions to the envelope and says quietly pausing between each sentence im sorry about this
i didnt know your situation
its not on the register
howd you lose your parents
i shouldnt ask that
i wish we had time for an inspection back there
on the beach
i wouldve given you a commendable
that was one of the best pitched camp sites ive ever seen
sam does not respond
scout master ward asks in a wounded you dont want to be a khaki scout anymore
sam shakes his head
becky sits at the switchboard with her head phones on
captain sharp and scout master ward sit behind her wearing their own sets of head phones
there is a click on the other end of the line
judy i have your person to person from new penzance
go ahead new penzance
on one side of the frame we see captain sharp scout master ward and becky
on the other side we see a fifty year old woman in a blue and white uniform pants suit with a salvation army officer style hat and a red ribbon
tied in a bow around her neck
she is social services
she sits at a desk in a cinder block office
guards and orderlies criss cross in a bullet proof window to a long grey corridor behind her
this is captain sharp
social services flips open a file folder and picks up a ball point pen
she takes notes throughout the conversation
she says into her telephone hello captain sharp
this is social services
im calling in reference to sam shakusky ward of the state
i understand hes in your custody
whats his condition
has he suffered any injury or trauma of any kind
how do i get to you
the fastest way is by seaplane
jed can bring you in with the mail
ill come tomorrow morning if thats acceptable to you
is someone able to
social services contd provide reasonable care and nourishment for the boy until that time
is that a yes
ill contact you again before the end of the day
social services starts to hang up the telephone
captain sharp says abruptly wait a second
whats going to happen to him
social services puts down her pen
she clasps her hands together in front of her
she says finally well normally wed try to place him in another foster home but that option is no longer available to us in my opinion with his case history
which means hell go to juvenile refuge
captain sharp exchanges a look with scout master ward
scout master ward interjects whats that
social services frowns
she asks calmly
this is scout master ward
social services refers to a document in her file folder
an orphanage but the first step is the admissions panel requires a psychological evaluation to determine whether or not the boys a candidate for institutional treatment or electroshock therapy
beyond that excuse me
why would that be necessary
hes not violent
social services picks up the document
she points to it
the report describes an assault with scissors
that was the girl
who did that
well maybe she needs help too but thats not our job
social service hangs up the telephone
becky pulls the cords out of their sockets
scout master ward looks to captain sharp
becky opens a tin of home made lemon bars
captain sharp declines one
scout master ward tries one
he looks completely enchanted
the living room
there is a wicker rocking chair a vase filled with wilted wildflowers and a portrait of some
pilgrims hanging over a stone fireplace
lionel murray and rudy sit together on the floor playing parchesi
bishop lurches into the doorway shirtless
he carries an open bottle of red wine with a glass in one hand and a long handled woodsmans axe in the other
ill be out back
lionel murray and lionel look up from their game
he seems slightly disoriented
im going to find a tree to chop down
lionel rolls a pair of dice
old linoleum floor
dark curtainless window
one bare light bulb
suzy sits erect in the bathtub staring blankly into space
bishop washes her with a soapy sponge
suzys clothes and leather folder are in the corner with the kitten scratching at them
i do know what youre feeling suzy bean
ive had moments myself where i say what am i doing here
who made this decision
how could i allow myself to do something so stupid and why is it still happening
we women are more emotional
you have to suzy turns to mrs
bishop and interrupts i hate you
dont say hate
i mean it
you think you mean it
in this moment
youre trying to hurt me
i know what you do with that sad dumb police man
you go to bed with him
bishop looks stunned
she says quietly hes not dumb but i guess he is kind of sad
anyway we shouldnt discuss that
its not appropriate for me to even acknowledge what i already just said
bishop sees something sticking out of the leather folder
she pulls it out and stares at it
it is the coping with the very troubled child pamphlet
she looks to suzy
suzy looks away
bishop sighs deeply and says on the verge of tears poor suzy
why is everything so hard for you
suzy starts to cry
she covers her face
her voice breaks as were in love
we just want to be together
whats wrong with that
bishop puts her arms around suzy
suzy shakes silently sobbing
bishop pulls some twigs and stems out of suzys hair
she studies the beetle earrings
she says wearily oh my god
how are we going to get these fish hooks out
captain sharp cooks sausages on a skillet in a kitchenette
he has a bottle of beer in his hand
sam sits waiting at a fold out table with a glass of milk in front of him
he says without looking up i admit we knew wed get in trouble
that parts true
we knew people would be worried and we still ran away anyway but something also happened which we didnt do on purpose
when we first met each other
something happened to us
captain sharp stirs the sausages in the pan
he says i agree with you
i cant argue against anything youre saying but i dont have to because youre twelve years old
captain sharp brings the skillet to the table and serves three links onto one plate and three onto another
he sits down
look lets face it youre probably a much more intelligent person than i am
in fact i guarantee it but even smart kids sometimes stick their fingers in electrical sockets if you see what i mean
it takes time to figure things out
its been proven by history all mankind makes mistakes
its our job to try to protect you from the dangerous ones
if we can
captain sharp pours an inch of beer into a glass and slides it over to sam
you want a slug
he and captain sharp both drink sips
captain sharp asks gently and sincerely whats the rush
youve got your whole life in front of yourself
ahead of you i mean
anyway youre a bachelor
what does that have to do with it
so are you
did you love someone ever
yes i did
she didnt love me back
sam considers this
captain sharp looks depressed
they start eating their sausages
captain sharp says quietly im sorry for your loss
anyway thats what people say
a drunk truck driver smashed into them
captain sharp refills both their beer glasses
scout master ward sits on his cot in his pajamas again with a cigarette in his mouth
his tape recorder is recording
he says into the microphone scout masters log
scout master ward hesitates
he thinks for a minute
he takes a deep breath
he closes his eyes
he opens them again
he looks desperate
he looks up at the ceiling
he shakes his head
he presses stop
he kneels on the floor with his palms together and smokes
there is a slight commotion outside
scout master ward
stow it out there
i want to hear some zs
the fort sixty feet above the camp
it is still under construction
the entire troop with the exceptions of redford and sam has gathered for a clandestine meeting
they all wear pajamas
skotak stands on a balcony with his back to the group and his hands on a wooden railing
i heard hes going to reform school
i heard theyre going to take out a piece of his brain and send him to an insane asylum
i like his girl
shes too scruffy for me
supposedly they got to third base
thats not true
he just felt her up
over shirt or under shirt
skotak slams his fist on the railing
everyone looks startled
skotak turns around to face the group
he says damn us
the railing collapses behind skotak ripping part of a wall and a row of shingles off the structure as it falls away
there is a moment of silence before it hits the ground with a splintering thud
he moves a half step away from the edge
he continues this troop has been very shabby to field mate sam shakusky
in fact weve been a bunch of mean jerks
whys he so unpopular
i admit supposedly hes
emotionally disturbed but hes also a disadvantaged orphan
how would you feel
skotak moves among the group looking from face to face as nickleby
from the heart gadge
skotak circles around the edge of the tree house
he says hes a fellow khaki scout and he needs our help
are we man enough to give that
so part of his brain doesnt get removed out of him
skotak stands still
he says mysteriously they were prepared to die for each other out there
the other scouts begin to murmur to each other shaking their heads shrugging whispering and gesturing
finally deluca looks up to skotak
what do you need
three yards of chicken wire some ripped up newspapers and a bucket of wheatpaste
a thick tree has been chopped almost completely through its trunk
for some reason it remains standing
bishop sits on the ground leaning against it
he breathes heavily
the axe rests across his lap
a twig snaps
bishop looks up listening
he drinks a sip of wine
in the background on the other side of the lawn five small silhouettes run silently in a row away from the house into the trees on the left
a moment later one taller silhouette rides a bicycle silently away from the house into the trees on the right
captain sharp sits on the hood of his station wagon
bishop leans against it with her bicycle in front of her
they smoke cigarettes
captain sharp says sadly in other words its over
i guess so
for the moment
until further notice
ive got to do better
well i hope you can
i think you will
youre doing the right thing
captain sharp suddenly slides his hand inside mrs
bishops shirt onto her breast and simultaneously kisses her then just as suddenly gets into his car and starts the engine
she reaches inside the window and puts her hand on the top of captain sharps head
she says worried who know whats going to happen duffy
ill probably see you tomorrow
no you wont
the motor idles
captain sharp says distantly
i admire them you know
theres a purity to it
i only feel bad because they both seem like such unhappy lonely miserable people but maybe thats romantic
i dont see it that way
captain sharp puts the car into gear and drives off
bishop finishes her cigarette
she gets on her bicycle and rides away
a burning match drops down into the fireplace near the foot of a bunk where sam lies sleeping
he has the sheet pulled up to his chin but his toes stick out
he opens one eye
dust descends and settles
something scrapes and scratches
the flame burns out
sam slides slowly off the mattress and creeps across the floor
he crouches in front of the fireplace
he flicks on a scout flashlight and sees the end of a hanging rope
sam leans quickly into the fireplace and looks straight up shining his flashlight
skotak is looking down at him from the top of the chimney
he puts his finger to his lips
sam get out of my chimney
listen to me
were here for friendship
were going to get you off this island
this is an emergency rescue
its worthless to me
theres no point
not without suzy
skotak gestures for sam to wait
he disappears from view
a moment later suzys face appears at the top of the chimney smiling toothily
sam looks ecstatic
howd you get here
they snuck me down the laundry chute and left a paper mache dummy in my bed
the next room
captain sharp sleeps in boxer shorts on the floor of the kitchenette in the dark
he snores quietly
five mini canoes race across a wide choppy strait close to the open sea
skotak deluca nickleby gadge lazy eye panagle roosevelt chef and izod paddle aggressively
we hear in voice over where we going
my cousin ben runs the supply and resources outpost for the jubilee
hes a falcon scout legionnaire
cousin benll know what to do
can we trust him
normally id say no
sam and suzy ride in the back of the canoe that skotak rows
sam has his arms around suzys waist
the kitten is on her shoulder
sam sees the portable record player among suzys things
did you leave another note for lionel
not this time
he cant keep his trap shut
besides ill probably never see him again
a pebble beach below high dunes
large waves sweep into the shore
spray blows through the air
there is a black lighthouse on a rocky point in the distance
the narrator stands at the waters edge holding a meteorologists measuring stick
he braces himself against the gusting winds
he speaks to the camera this is the island of st
jack wood extending far north from lands end along the deep water channel that leads to broken rock
a low flood plain separates the beach from the town ship above
a small but prosperous community
the narrator takes out a pocket barometer
he reads it
he the barometer reads twenty seven inches and dropping
strong winds as you can see already at twenty two knots
checks his watch the time is now four thirty five a
the narrator walks quickly out of the shot
the five canoes land on the beach with the tide
sam suzy skotak and the rest of the troop quickly jump out and drag the boats up the shore
the room is black
bishop lie in separate single beds side by side
they both stare at the ceiling
the windows rattle the walls creak and trees sway outside
bishop whispers did you file the motion for continuance
it was sustained
did the judge consider your application for leniency
he granted it
bishops voice breaks as she says quietly im sorry walt
its not your fault
which injuries are you apologizing for
whichever ones still hurt
half of those were self inflicted
bishop shakes her head and smiles with tears on her face
a powerful blast of wind shakes the room
a night light blinks
bishop has a lump in his throat as he says i hope the roof flies off and i get sucked up into space
youll be better off without me
stop feeling sorry for yourself
bishop look across at each other in the dark
bishop says desperately were all theyve got walt
bishop takes a deep breath
he says finally with a
its not enough
flashlight and lantern flames flicker over the jagged walls
skotak is curled in a blanket on a high rock
gadge is tucked into a sleeping bag under a ledge
the troop nestle on rocks and ledges in bedrolls and sleeping bags all around the deep cavern
sam lies on his back on one of the bedrolls smoking his pipe while suzy sits indian style next to him
she reads aloud from a book called annabelles midnight
there is an illustration on the cover of a blonde girl climbing out a window onto a trellis with fireflies circling around her
but im not going said barnaby jack
im running away tonight for good and this time i wont get caught
annabelle whispered im coming with you
her yellow hair now brown at the roots caught up in the wind and danced
barnaby jack took annabelles hand and pressed something into it the size of a jellybean
hide this in your socks and be ready at midnight
suzy looks to sam to see if he is still awake
sam looks to the rest of the troop to see if they are still awake
they all nod and signal for suzy to continue
suzy turns the page and reads on he leapt out the window and landed in the fresh fallen snow
the next morning
scout master ward emerges from his tent
he puts on his hat
the wind whips it off his head
he chases it catches it and puts it back on with the chin strap tight
he shouts no bugle
lazy eye gadge deluca izod
wheres my troop
scout master ward tries to light a cigarette but the match blows out
he walks past the latrine the workbench the row of smaller tents and the charcoal grill
he throws his hands into the air
scout master ward shakes his head
he arrives at the picnic table and rings his bell
he sits down
he opens a new issue of indian corn
there is a picture on the cover of a scout troop rappelling in tasmania
he struggles to keep the rippling pages from turning by themselves
the first page
there is another drawing of the scout master in chief
this time he is behind the wheel of a ship
his signature below once again reads commander pierce
there is a quotation in large text anyone can hold the helm when the sea is calm
scout master ward lowers his magazine
he looks around confused
something dawns on him
a small entourage of teenage scouts studies maps charts and documents at folding tables
one of them sits at a telegraph machine
he wears headphones and taps morse code on a paddle as he listens to a transmission
he looks puzzled
he swivels his chair to a steno machine and begins typing rapidly
a triple sized tent with a canopy in front and a large totem pole looming over it
it stands on five foot stilts
there is a school bus parked next to it with letters painted across its side which read regional jubilee
a forty five year old scout master with several medals on his chest is sharpening a straight razor
he is secretary mcintire
he adjusts a hot towel on the face of a man in a barbers chair
the young telegraph operator hurries out of the tent carrying a strip of paper
he hands it to secretary mcintire
secretary mcintire stares at it
he says to the man under the youre not going to believe this one sir
that scout master on new penzance
has now lost his entire troop
the seated man whips the towel off his face and rises to his feet
he is commander pierce himself
he has silver hair a moustache and a much greater number of medals
he says in disbelief as he snatches the slip of paper
well ill be damned
who is this bimbo
i couldnt say
commander pierce shakes his head
he continues to study the document as he sits back down
secretary mcintire begins to lather his cheeks with a brush
a vast archway of wood straw and rope construction
fort lebanon is spelled out across the top with bound sticks
a large flag waving madly on a pole reads khaki scouts of north america
a bugler on a platform plays the familiar staccato tattoo
it echoes for miles
sam and suzy wait inside the gates crouched behind a row of trash cans with the rest of the troop except skotak
sam has on his back pack
suzy carries her suitcase
gadge holds a tennis ball can
a scout master in an indian chiefs headdress stops as he walks by
he looks curiously at sam and especially suzy
he says to nickleby whos your unit leader
nickleby points to a fat man in an apron cooking hamburgers on a grill
the scout master shrugs
skotak comes over and says theres a broken gum ball machine behind the snack tent
skotak distributes a handful of gum balls among sam suzy and the rest of the troop
they all put them in their mouths
skotak motions for everyone to follow him
a footbridge across a stream leads to a quonset hut with an awning in front labelled supply tent
a crowd of very young scouts waits at a wide counter bartering over boxes of food drink and equipment
a team of helpers collects money and packages goods
at the center there is a twenty year old
scout with a pencil behind his ear
he is cousin ben
he says to a nine year old junior khaki i dont care how they do it where you come from
you want pop
you want candy
you want a snake bite kit
get some money
skotak appears and whispers something to cousin ben
cousin ben nods
he says to his customers come back in five minutes
cousin ben pulls a curtain shut behind the counter
sam suzy skotak and the rest of the troop follow cousin ben briskly out a door and onto a cat walk that runs along the top of a wall made
from tall pointed logs
as they talk they walk past dozens of rows and clusters of tents grouped by color in the fields below
they walk past towers huts ladders latrines and a catapult under construction
they walk past a white infirmary with a red cross on it and a doctor taking a boys blood pressure
they walk past a fleet of small antique sailboats flying assorted troop banners
five hundred scouts and fifty scout masters work eat talk cook and play sports and games all around the compound in spite of the fierce winds
one group rides motorcycles another fires model rockets another flies by overhead on a cable trolley
cousin ben points to sam and asks skotak over the sound of is this him
field mate sam shakusky troop resigned
almost too hot
whats in the can
seventy six dollars but its mostly in nickels
give it to me
skotak motions for gadge to hand cousin ben the tennis ball can
it appears to be very heavy and jingles as it moves
cousin ben takes it
he says to sam you badge in seamanship
sam points to one of the patches on his sash
it has an anchor embroidered on it
theres cold water crabber moored off broken rock
the skipper owes me an i
well see if he can take you on as a claw cracker
it wont be an easy life but its better than shock therapy
thank you sir
by the way wheres the chapel tent
cousin ben hesitates
he points behind them with his thumb back there but the padres home with the mumps
why do you ask
i want to bring my wife
cousin ben stops walking
he looks sam up and down
suzy says but were not married yet
cousin ben turns to suzy
he looks back to sam and back to suzy again
you his girl
cousin ben looks intrigued
he says tentatively technically im a civil law scrivener
im authorized to declare births deaths and marriages
youre kind of young
you got a license
sam and suzy shake their heads
cousin ben nods
he speaks more gently now i cant offer you a legally binding union
it wont hold up in the state the county or frankly any courtroom in the world due to your age lack of a license and failure to get parental consent
but the ritual does carry a very important moral weight within yourselves
you cant enter into this lightly
do you love each other
sam and suzy immediately nod
cousin ben continues are you sure youre ready for this
sam and suzy immediately nod
cousin ben looks perturbed
let me rephrase it
were in a hurry
spit out the gum sister
in fact everybody
cousin ben puts out his hand
suzy spits her gum into his palm
he throws it away over his shoulder
sam and the rest of the troop spit their gum out on the ground
cousin ben i dont like the snappy attitude
this is the most important decision youve made in your lives
now go over by that trampoline and talk it through before you give me another quick answer
cousin ben watches as sam and suzy walk away and stand next to a large trampoline
a small scout jumps from a high ladder bounces and does a back flip
sam and suzy uncertain how to begin the conversation
i guess we better try to pretend were struggling over our decision for a minute before we go back over there and tell him maybe hes right
it could be a mistake
sam looks stunned
he is speechless
he stammers what
sometimes it seems sad to me
it might be better to just go steady permanently
sam shakes his head
he looks off into the distance
he says i dont know what to say
cousin ben counting nickels in the tennis ball can
he jerks his thumb toward sam and suzy and says dismissively i guess theyre probably just trying to pretend theyre struggling over their decision but at least woah
cousin ben looks
suzy has her hands around sams throat and is throttling him
sam squirms loose and calms her down
the troop watches transfixed
sam takes a snapshot out of his pocket and shows it to suzy explaining
they come back over to the group
there are tears on suzys cheeks
she says to cousin ben were sure
lets do a blood test
cousin ben stands at a collapsible altar
he wears a purple silk stole around his neck with crosses stitched into it
and suzy hold a bible with their hands on it
skotak and the rest of troop listen solemnly as cousin ben reads from a which we hereby consecrate on this day the fifth of september
thats the end of the short form
do any of the witnesses have objections or remarks
usually they dont
skotak raises his hand
cousin ben reluctantly calls on him skotak
can we loan them the nickels
im worried about their future
thats my fee
skotak and the rest of the troop look very concerned
they murmur to each other whats going to happen to them
lets take a vote
all in favor thats my fee
skotak and the rest of the troop look to cousin ben
cousin ben glares at them
he points to skotak
youre just like your brothers
ok give them the tennis ball can
cousin ben points to the tennis ball can on the floor next to his feet
skotak takes it and zips it into a side pocket of
sams back pack
cousin ben hands sam and suzy a receipt on a clipboard
sign here and initial here and here
sam and suzy sign and initial
cousin ben tears out a copy
take the carbon
leave the bible
sam and suzy turn and walk out of the chapel tent holding hands
they do not smile
cousin ben skotak and the rest of the troop follow them with grave expressions on their faces
sam touches suzys hair
suzy kisses sams hand
they walk as a group through the camp
sam suzy skotak and the rest of the troop wait at the end of a narrow dock
cousin ben stands below them in a small sailboat
he reaches up to suzy and lifts her onboard
he reaches up to sam and lifts him onboard too
he rigs the sail
sam smiles sadly
he and skotak do the secret handshake
the others quickly join in
suzy blows them a kiss
everyone looks choked up
cousin ben unloops a line
the sails quickly catch the strong wind and the boat sails away into the harbor
skotak and the rest of troop wave and salute
they watch bittersweet
where they going again
hes going to work on a shrimper if i understand correctly
i wish them well
he turns and starts up the dock
the others follow him
i think theyre coming back
skotak and the rest of the troop stop and turn around
the sailboat glides back in
sam leaps onto the dock with the tennis ball can
suzy looks worried
cousin ben yells be quick sailor
she left her binoculars on a hook in the chapel tent
just leave them
sam sprints up the dock
he yells back over his shoulder we cant
its her magic power
a binocular shot of sam running full speed through the compound
he approaches quickly then skids to a stop
redford blocks the entrance
he is dressed in white hospital pajamas with a red cross on the breast pocket
his side is heavily bandaged and his arm is attached to an i v drip
he lowers suzys binoculars
sam stands frozen in front of redford
redford stares at him icily
sam starts to say something then pauses
he says you killed your dog by the way
well it couldnt be helped
he asks quietly
why do you consider me your enemy
he says in disbelief because your girlfriend stabbed me in the back with lefty scissors
shes my wife now
im saying before that
six weeks ago
from day one
whatd i do wrong
im trying to understand
why dont you like me
why should i
nobody else does
sam runs up to redford and pokes him as hard as he can in the scissor cut with his finger
scouts and scout masters everywhere stop what they are doing and look to the chapel tent
across the compound commander pierce comes out of his tent alerted
sam whips the binoculars out of redfords hands turns away and sprints
no one moves anywhere except sam dashing toward the marina
redford shouts at the top of his lungs hes here
an emergency alarm sounds
the entire camp swings into action
two teams of scouts playing capture the flag descend from both sides and cut sam off from the dock
they wear red and yellow jerseys over their uniforms
suzy jumps out of the boat onto the dock
sam sees her beyond the blockade of scouts
she waves her arms
sam throws up his hands
he sprints in a new direction onto a wide field
there is a small pink flag on a thin stick stuck in the ground at the center of a plastic ring
sam grabs it as he runs past
he looks back and sees
a mob of fifty scouts chasing him
he circles in a giant figure eight trailed by the huge group
he races up a hill and stops at the top
sam looks down at the approaching scouts and hundreds of others watching
a dark cloud rolls in casting a giant shadow over the entire camp
sam throws the little flag down at his pursuers like a javelin
it sails in an arc and pokes down into the grass
there is a thunderclap
sam looks up into the sky
a bolt of lightning strikes him
sam is thrown ten feet through the air and lands on his back
the tennis ball can explodes nickels
the mob of scouts stops with a jolt
they look terrified
sam sits up
he is covered in black soot
his shoes are on fire
he shakes them off his feet
suzy runs through the crowd of scouts and drops down on her knees in front of sam
she looks astonished
sam says im ok
suzy helps sam to his feet
sam raises suzys smoldering binoculars to his eyes
skotak and the rest of the troop join them
a binocular shot of a ladder leaning against a high fence
sam leads suzy skotak and the rest of the troop fly at a sprint to the fence climb the ladder and pull it up after them
a bugle plays a cavalry charge
the mob bolts after them
on one side of the frame we see captain sharp scout master ward and becky wearing their operator head phones
on the other side we see commander pierce secretary mcintire and the commanders entourage inside the command tent
commander pierce says into his field telephone captain sharp weve located the missing troop
they just fled camp
commander pierce contd pursuit
theyre accompanied by a twelve year old girl in knee socks and sunday school shoes

captain sharp spins around in his chair and flips a switch on a two way radio
he says into a microphone jed re route to st

captain sharp sets down the microphone
he turns to becky
becky notify the bishops suzys there
captain sharp turns to scout master ward
scout master ward is already on his feet
he peels off his head phones
im on my way
becky plugs a cord into a socket and says hello
captain sharp looks out the window with a sense of dread
bishop listens on the telephone with a strained look on his face
bishop watches him intently
oh dear god
bishop grabs mrs
bishop by the wrist
he says grimly get the boys
bishop raises her megaphone to her mouth
she shouts lets go
a dehavilland beaver in heavy rain and turbulence

jed presses the yoke forward and the plane dips hard
social services braces against the dash
scout master ward steers his outboard through the open channel
the boat crests high over deep swells flooding over in waves
scout master ward is drenched
he does not flinch or even appear to notice
sam suzy skotak and the rest of the troop scramble through the woods as fast as they can
there are flashes of lightning and pounding thunder
suzy trips on a root and sam pulls her to her feet
sam trips on a rock and suzy pulls him to his feet
the commanders entourage is frantically packing up their portable telephones p
system folding tables collapsible chairs etc
one of them wraps a tarp around boxes labelled fireworks
a transistor radio
the announcer says urgently once again storm waters have just breached the dam at black beacon

commander pierce and secretary mcintire listen to the report
secretary mcintire says gravely thats coming our way

commander pierce rips it open

another mimeographed page is stapled to the bulletin board
the heading is now summer pageant
it reads performed by the choristers of st

he looks up
sam and suzy have arrived at the top
they inch away sideways around a ledge and disappear to the other side
captain sharps voice where you going

captain sharp rubs his eyes
he knots one end of the rope around his waist and ties the other to a pipe at the foot of the gutter

sam and suzy at the top of the steeple standing with their backs against a painted cross

they are all just about to burst into a cheer when there is a second brighter flash followed by a much louder bang and then a terrible thunderous ripping explosion
the lights go out again
scout master ward mr
bishop and social services stare with their mouths open in frozen horror
the entire steeple has disappeared
only a twisted stump remains
off the edge of the roof at the end of the rope dangling in the rain captain sharp hangs swinging with sams hand in his fist and suzys in sams
voices shout in a panic above
sam and suzy look up at captain sharp
he says to them evenly swaying above the rushing water dont let go

now he puts it back together again in a fugue
lionel murray and rudy lie on the floor on their stomachs propped up with their chins on their fists

he whispers to suzy urgently see you tomorrow
suzy smiles back
sam ducks away
suzy goes over to the window and looks out with her binoculars
a binocular shot of sam dropping to the ground and running across the back lawn into the trees
he comes out on the dirt road where captain sharp waits sitting on the hood of his station wagon smoking a cigarette
they both get into the car and drive off
suzy lowers the binoculars
she pauses in front of the easel and looks at the picture
she walks quietly away down the stairs
the kitten follows her
the record continues to play on the empty landing
the camera moves in toward sams painting on the easel
it is a watercolor landscape of mile
the tent is pitched on the beach and sams and suzys clothes hang on the clothesline
