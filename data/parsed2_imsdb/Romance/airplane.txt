elaine approaches mrs
strikers seat is vacant
would you like something to read
do you have anything light
elaine hands her a small piece of paper
how about this leaflet famous jewish sports legends
taking pamphlet yes
elaine turns and is shocked to see striker approaching his seat
ted what are you doing here
elaine ive got to talk to you
you shouldnt have come
i dont have time now
striker sits down
no wonder youre upset
and a darling figure
supple pouting breasts
its a shame youre not getting along
yes i know
things used to be different
i remember when we first met
it was during the war
striker is seated at bar in a smoke filled room
an assortment of unsavory characters are hanging around the bar
i was in the air force stationed in drambuie on the barbary coast
i used to hang out in the magumba bar
shapely female legs walking on bar stop in front of striker
sleazy trombone music
camera pans up shapely female in tight fitting dress
she is playing the sleazy trombone music
it was a rough place
you would count on a fight breaking out almost every night
two girl scouts are slugging it out old western style breaking tables and chairs
an unsavory character puts a quarter in the jukebox
one girl scout bashes the other against the jukebox buttons
disco tune plays
girl scout is bashed against jukebox again
girl scout bashes again
the unsavory character nods approvingly at selections
patrons are dancing a la john travolta
i didnt go there that night to fall in love i just dropped in for a couple of drinks
he turns to look toward dance floor
but suddenly there she was
elaine dancing with grizzly looking cutthroat
i was captivated entranced
it hit me like a thunderbolt
i had to ask the guy next to me to pinch me to make sure i wasnt dreaming
striker asks the burly longshoreman next to him to to pinch him
longshoreman gives him a look and moves away cautiously
i was afraid to approach her but that night fate was on my side
elaines dancing partner is stabbed in the back and falls to the grould
no one notices but striker who eagerly fills in
they make a perfect disco couple
the other dancers make a circle around them
they begin with fancy disco steps move on to flips and seemingly impossible acrobatics finally ending with incredible stunts striker jumping through flaming hoops and elaine hanging from a chandelier
by her teeth and twirling
bar is closing chairs on tables bartender sweeping floor elaine and striker dancing slowly in center of room
one final girl scout flies into frame and falls in a lifeless heap at their feet
we laughed we talked we danced i never wanted it to end and i guess i still dont
but enough about me
i hope this hasnt been boring for you
camera widens to reveal mrs
elderlys legs dangling next to him
she has hung herself
its just that when i start to talk about elaine i get so carried away i lose all track of time not unlike oliver in jesus the man
milton carrying a tray with two cups of coffee approaches bernice
i happened to be passing and i thought you might like some corfee
thats very nice of you
she takes a cup
ah wont you sit down

randy moves on

elaine is replacing a magazine and catches sight of striker
boring another passenger
she moves into the alcove and begins to pour coffee
camera moves into closeup of elaine
striker and elaine are running
she falls down at the waters edge exhausted
striker drops to his knees and they embrace passionately
a huge wave washes over them covering them completely
when the wave recedes theyre still locked in the same embrace
they are covered with seaweed
fish are flopping around in the sand
oh ted i never knew i could be so happy
these past few months have been wonderful
tomorrow why dont we drive up the coast to that little seafood place and
whats the matter

murdock picks up phone

joey has been paying very close attention to murdock and suddenly recognizes him
wait a minute

im sorry son but you must have me confused with someone else
my name is roger murdock

he turns to basta

victor is puzzled
you are kareem
ive seen you play

let him stay up here
but just remember my name is roger murdock
he points to his nametag

and that lots of times you dont even run down court
we are turning left to a heading of zero niner niner
and that you dont really try except during the playoffs

murdock realizes he has given himself away
he quickly looks to see if oveur is listening
oveur is busy checking instruments
murdock grabs joey by the collar and whispers angrily
listen kid ive been hearing that crap ever since i was at ucla
tell your old man to drag unseld and lanier up and down the court for forty eight minutes
into mike ah
denver control this is flight two zero niner continuing on a heading two niner niner
elaine is seated next to striker
elaine just hear me out
i know things havent been right for a long time
but it will be different
like it was in the beginning
i remember everything
all i have are memories
soft music begins
mostly i remember
the nights when we were together
i remember how you used to hold me
and how i used to sit on your face and wriggle
and then afterwards how wed watch until the sun came up
when it did it was almost like
like each new day was created
only for us
thats the way ive always wanted it to be elaine
but it wont be
not as long as you insist on living in the past
elaine leaves teary eyed
fighter plane diving
squadron leader v
youre too low ted
youre too low
fighter plane crashes
sign in front reads master charge visa carte blanche striker is lying in bed painting a canvas
elaine is seated at bedside
you got a telegram from headquarters today
what is it
its a big building where the generals meet
but thats not important right now
theyve cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid
isnt that good news
a surreal image of a soldier contorted like a pretzel clutching a machine gun in one hand and a crying infant in the other
because of my mistake six men didnt return from that raid
lieutenant zipp died this morning
ted doctor sandler says youll be out in a week
isnt that wonderful
in the b
a doctor in a white lab coat is attending a patient
when he turns around we see he is wearing an stp insignia on his back
i wish i could say the same for george zipp
be patient ted
no one expects you to get over this immediately
striker is despondent
hospital angle sgt
mccobb day he is posing for strikers painting contorted like a pretzel holding a machine gun in one hand and crying baby in the other
mccobb how about a break
im getting tired
mccobb untangles himself and walks off
i found a wonderful apartment for us
its got a brick fireplace and a cute little bedroom with mirrors on the ceiling
captain geline o
im off course

he thinks hes a pilot still fighting the war
captain geline agonizing and making bombing and machine gun noises
lieutenant hurwitz o
whats his problem
thats lieutennt hurwitz
severe shell shock
he thinks hes ethel merman
strapped to the bed is ethel merman singing everythings coming up roses
she breaks loose from the straps for a grand finale
two attendants attempt to restrain her
excuse me sir
would you like some coffee before we serve dinner
no thank you
randy moves on to the hammens
would either of you like another cup of coffee
i will but jim wont
yes i think i will have another cup of coffee
camera zooms to closeup of mrs
hammens thoughts v
jim never has a second cup of coffee at home
randy approaches sister angelina
the guitar is on the seat next to her
excuse me sister
theres a little girl on board whos ill and
oh yes i saw
could i borrow your guitar
i thought i might be able to cheer her up
randy takes the guitar and walks down the aisle
the guitar clonks people on the back of the head
randy approaches lisa
is it all right if i talk to your daughter
oh i think that would be nice
to lisa who is reading hi
oh you have a guitar
i thought maybe youd like to hear a song
oh id love to
okay this is one of my favorites
randy is sitting on the edge of the gurney as she strums three opening chords
strumming and singing in ballad tempo ive traveled the banks of the river jordan to find where it flows to the sea
stewardesses and passengers notice the singer and peer around corners and over seat backs
a mans head peers upside down from the top of the frame
i looked in the eyes of the cold and the hungry and saw that i was looking at me
as singing continues shirley and jack look at each other with saccherine smiles the hammens do the same then the krishnas then the black dudes
finally everyone is smiling sweetly at each other
murdock and oveur smile sweetly at each other
singing and playing the guitar and i wanted to know if life had a purpose and what it all means in the end
in the silence i listened to the voices inside me and they told me again and again
tempo jumps to rock pace
there is only one river
there is only one sea
randy in her growing enthusiasm swings her guitar knocking the i
connection tube from lisas arm
squirts and lisa turns pale and hollowcheeked
no one else notices
and it flows through you and it flows through me
there is only one people we are one and the same
lisa manages to reconnect her i
still singing we are all one spirit one name
we are the father we are the son
randy again knocks i
from lisas arm with guitar as the passengers start to get into the music
in the dawn of creation
we are one
davis rushes to reconnect lisas i
lisa doesnt react
davis pounds lisas chest
we are only one people we are one and the same
as lisa revives randy swings her guitar and clonks mrs
davis on the head
we are all one spirit on earth one name
randy passengers v
we are the father we are the son and in the dawn of creation we are one
elaine enters with dinners
hey weve been waiting for you
a little bit late tonight
who wants to be first
go ahead clarence i got it
oveur removes his headset elaine puts tray down
hows the weather
not so good
weve got some heavy stuff ahead of us
it might get rough again unless we can climb on top
but our airspeed is holding steady at six hundred ten knots
by the way joey hammen asked me if you would autograph this basketball
murdock autographs it reluctantly
a japanese general dressed in world war ii uniform is now seated next to striker
after the war i just wanted to get as far away from things as possible
so elaine and i joined the peace corps
we were assigned to an isolated tribe the molombos
striker and elaine are being escorted to the chiefs hut by two guards
we hear jungle animal sounds
the chief is standing in front of his hut surrounded by several tribesmen who are making the jungle animal sounds
they had never seen americans before
when striker and elaine arrive the chief holds up his hands and the sounds stop
at first they didnt know what to think of us but soon we gained their trust
the chief extends his right hand for conventional handshake
striker shows him power grip
when the chief is pleased striker gives him five
the chief pauses then decks striker
it really was a challenge during the year introducing them to our western culture
elaine is having a supperware party for native women
also supperware products are ideal for storing leftovers to help stretch your food dollar
this two quart seals m rite container with a special close m tite lid keeps hotdog buns fresh for days and prevents sugared cereals from sticking
she scoops a ladle of corn mush from a carved wooden bowl into a supperware container
meat and dairy products are protected against unwanted refrigerator odors when sealed in this non slip pastel colored freez o leer
when she burps the lid the supperware makes a human burp striker nailing crude basketball rim and net to tree
you must understand that these people had been completely isolated from civilization
striker demonstrates a two handed set shot to natives
no one had ever outlined a physical fitness program for them and they had no athletic equipment
native examines basketball for first time
after two slow dribbles he gracefully feints lefts then dribbling through his legs sinks a two hand over the head reverse dunk shot
we also emphasized nutrition and taught them to watch their diets
another native hits a long jump shot
the exercise improved their physical fitness and condition
one shot after another swishes through the basketball rim
my working with them seemed to reinforce our objectives of group cooperation and controlled competitive activity
striker approaches elaine who is standing on the sideline
as they talk the natives are passing the ball around and shooting baskets harlem globetrotter fashion
i think theyre getting the hang of it
when we re enlist ill teach them baseball
ted i dont want to stay here
its time for us to go back home to the plans we made before the war
a lot of people made plans before the war
like george zipp
elaine walks away dejectedly
camera stays with striker as he pours gator ade into a glass
i guess it was at that moment that i first realized elaine had doubts about our relationship
and that as much as anything else led to my drinking problem
striker has a problem drinking
he raises his glass of gator ade then suddenly pours it on his forehead
we did come back to the states
i tried a number of jobs
well i could go on for hours but id probably start to bore you
the japanese general is kneeling on the seat committing hari kari
you know i really couldnt blame elaine
she wanted a career
i was offered a job at boeing but i couldnt bring myself to take it
the businessman waiting in strikers cab checks his watch
thunder and lightning
shirley is ill and holding her stomach in pain
oh i cant stand it
what is it
i havent felt this awful since we saw that lina wertmuller film
ill see if i can find some dramamine
elaine is on the phone
captain one of the women passengers is very sick
joey enters to retrieve basketball
murdock is wearing goggles
i think so but ive never seen it so acute
find out if theres a doctor on board as quietly as you can
oveur hangs up phone
joey have you ever been in a turkish prison
nauseous oooh i shouldnt have had that second cup of coffee
he grabs for motion sickness bag
camera zooms to closeup of mrs
hammens thoughts v
jim never vomits at home
thunder and lightning
elaine is speaking to couple
im sorry i had to wake you
im just looking for a doctor
theres nothing to worry about
middle aged lady mrs
yaffe having overheard this conversation beckons to elaine
stewardess i think the man next to me is a doctor
the man next to her is wearing a surgical cap with mask
hanging around his neck is a stethoscope
excuse me sir
im sorry to have to wake you
are you a doctor
we have some passengers who are very sick
could you come and take a look at them
yes of course
rumack picks up bag and exits with elaine
rumack and elaine enter
rumack stoops over to shirley and surgical instrument is slapped into his hand from o
he pokes her stomach with his hand
she winces and nods
may i see your tongue please
she sticks her tongue out
rumack pulls on it until it is obviously too long
he continues to pull and the tongue becomes multi colored magicians scarves
then he pulls out a bouquet of flowers followed by a white dove
ill be back in a minute
rumack takes elaine aside
youd better tell the captain
weve got to land as soon as we can
this woman has to be gotten to a hospital
what is it
its a big building with patients
but thats not important right now
tell the captain i must speak to him

fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains
weve got to go through to chicago
suddenly the plane rocks violently
rumack and oveur lose balance
thunder and lightning plane is flying erratically
murdock unconscious is slumped over controls
oveur and rumack burst into cockpit
oveur gets into pilots seat
excitedly get him out of there
altitude is fluctuating
oveur struggles with controls
they extricate murdock from behind the wheel
he is wearing shorts kneepads and basketball shoes
climbing and diving
passengers are being tossed about
a woman applying lipstick smears it over her face
cigarette with line slashed through and couple copulating with line slashed through
randy loses her balance and shoves dinner into a passengers face
struggling with controls finally regains level flight
thunder and lightning plane levels off
christopher statue is holding a motion discomtort bag to its mouth
what is it doctor

i havent seen anything like this since the lina wertmuller film festival
rumack and elaine are now standing face to face
oveur in the f
is at controls

passengers are listening to p
its been a little bumpy up here but well be past it in a few minutes
randy and elaine drag murodck and basta down center aisle
a couple points of interest were just now passing over the hoover dam and later on our course will take us just south of the grand canyon
meanwhile relax and enjoy the rest of your flight
he hangs up phone and turns to rumack
that should do it
passengers are yelling screaming tearing their hair out climbing about
into microphone chicago this is flight two zero niner

camera pulls out to reveal dispatcher typing oveurs message
weve got to have all altitudes below us cleared and priority approach and landing in chicago

when he tries to remove paper from typewriter it rips in half
thunder and lightning
randy approaches hammens
hammen is sick

she turns to walk toward camera with horrified expression
elaine enters turns to face rumack
oveur is at controls in f
doctor rumack mister hammen ate fish
and randy says there are five more cases and they ate fish too
lets see now
the co pilot had fish
what did the navigator eat
he had fish too
oveur is picking up on the conversation
all right now we know what were up against
every passenger on this plane who ate fish for dinner will become violently ill within the next half hour
oveur looks down at his dinner tray and sees skeleton of the fish he just ate
just how serious is it doctor
it starts with a slight fever
oveur experiences what the doctor is describing
then a dryness in the throat
as the virus penetrates the red blood cells the victim becomes dizzy and begins to experience a rash and itching
from there the poison works its way into the central nervous system causing severe muscle spasms followed by the inevitable drooling
at this point the entire digestive system is rendered useless causing the complete collapse of the lower bowels accompanied by uncontrollable flatulence
until finally the poor bastard is reduced to a quivering wasted piece of jelly
oveur passes out and pitches forward onto the controls
rumack and elaine lose balance as plane dives
thunder and lightning as plane is diving
passengers are being tossed about
a woman applying rouge smears it all over her face
camera pans up to braless woman whose breasts are wiggling
as they finally untangle oveur from the wheel he gains semi consciousness
oveur passes out
uh automatic pilot
is frantically searching for automatic pilot button
there it is
elaines hand tenuously reaches for and turns switch to sound of rushing air as instantly inflatable balloon pilot takes shape in seat with hands on wheel
his uniform and cap are painted on and he has an alert leave the driving to us expression on his face
the plane immediately regains level flight and elaine and rumack sigh in relief
ill get back to the passengers

elaine picks up mike while still standing
this is elaine dickinson

camera pulls back to reveal dispatch is a beehive of activity
the chief dispatcher steve mccroskey is barking orders to air controller
mccroskey hold all takeoffs
i dont want another plane in the air
when the reports bring it straight in
air controller exits quickly
mccroskey picks up phone
mccroskey put out a general bulletin to suspend all meal service on flights out of los angeles
he hangs up phone and talks to air controller
mccroskey tell all dispatchers to remain at their posts
its going to be a long night
air controller exits
mccroskey notices he is out of coffee and turns to air controller hinshaw

we see them trying to walk in opposite directions
air controller enters
chief theres fog down to the deck everywhere east of the rockies

mccroskey looks like i picked the wrong week to quit smoking
he lights up a cigarette
mccroskey walks toward a table and leans on his hands
mccroskey i want the best available man on this
a man who knows this plane inside and out and wont crack under pressure
how about sal mineo
mccroskey get me rex kramer
lightning and thunder
elaine is in the pilots seat and the inflated automatic pilot is in co pilots seat
now elaine right next to the throttle is the air speed gauge
what speed does it indicate
three hundred twenty miles per hour
we see but elaine does not notice the automatic pilot very slowly beginning to deflate
now check your altitude
thats the dial just below and to the right of the air speed indicator
thirty five thousand feet
altitude is dropping
now it says thirty four thousand feet
its dropping fast
why is it doing that
by now the automatic pilot is really slumped over as it is quite deflated
it is staring at her with a half smile
elaine notices it
oh my god
the automatic pilot
all right elaine dont worry
we have an auxiliary inflation system
just follow my instructions
okay but please hurry
were dropping fast
passengers are being tossed about
rumack is examining a female patient
what the hells going on up there
rumack starts toward cockpit
now elaine dont panic
on the belt line of the automatie pilot there is a hollow tube
can you see that
yes i can see it
now thats the manual inflation nozzle
pull it out and blow it up like a balloon
elaine kneels over automatic pilots crotch puts tube in her mouth and blows
automatic pilot inflates
rumack bursts into cockpit
back of automatic pilot with elaine kneeling over its crotch
rumack slams the door in disbelief
with a big smile on its face
passengers are relieved as plane regains level flight
elaine and automatic pilot are relaxed in their seats
both are smoking cigarettes
thunder and lightning
elaine youre a member of this crew
can you face some unpleasant facts
unless i can get all these people to a hospital quickly i cant even be sure of saving their lives
now is there anyone else on board who can land this plane
striker struggling with drinking problem pours drink between his cheek and ear
no one that i know of
i think you ought to know what our chances are
the life of everyone on board depends on just one thing finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane but who didnt have fish for dinner
camera zooms into closeup of elaines face as she realizes the severity of the situation
thunder and lightning
passengers are listening to p
ladies and gentlemen this is your stewardess speaking
we regret any inconvenience the sudden cabin movement might have caused
randy drags unconscious pilot oveur down center aisle
this is due to periodic air pockets we encounter
there is no reason to become alarmed and we hope you enjoy the rest of your flight
by the way is there anyone on board who knows how to fly a plane
passengers are yelling screaming tearing their hair out and climbing around
a naked woman runs down the aisle
sister mary is choking a krishna
two passengers are dueling with swords
a spanish speaking lady waits for her husband to translate the announcement then panics
sound of car screeching to a stop
paul carey twenty four year old cleancut naive looking navigator trainee enters and pushes doorbell
we hear the typical eight note chime progression
the chimes then play the air force fight song
a dog barks and mrs
kramer opens the door
hello im paul carey from the airline
im here to pick up captain kramer
come in paul
rex will be right out
when carey enters a big dog jumps on him with its paws on his chest
so i understand youve got a real emergency down there
holding off dog well to tell the truth they really didnt fill me in on many of the details
just told me to pick up captain kramer
something about a plane with no pilot
carey begins to lose battle with the dog while trying to remain polite
yeah something like that but as i say they didnt have time to tell me very much
ill bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there
shep is growling and careys arm is locked firmly in his jaws
the airline business
shep pins carey against the wall ripping his sleeve
you begin to
gasp get used to it
he gets so excited when new people are here
we hear a thud and loud growling
are you a pilot yourself
carey is on the floor desperately fighting off the dog which is on top of him
navigator training program
kramer enters buttoning his coat
how many times have i warned those people about food inspection
kramer is tying his tie in the mirror
in the corner of the mirror carey is being thrashed by the dog
the airport management the f
and the airlines theyre all cheats and liars
all right lets get out of here
thunder and lightning
randy is talking to krishnas
sorry to bother you
we were just looking for someone with flying experience
they return to reading their playrama magazine with a female hari krishna in a sexy pose on the cover
striker is sitting next to a man from india in a business suit and turban
you see the day we left the village it was raining so we had to take a special jeep to the main road
the indian is dousing himself with a can of gasoline
randy is talking to passengers
in fact we were lucky to even get a jeep since just the day before the only one we had broke down it had a bad axle
the indian lights a match to immolate himself
excuse me sir
theres been a little problem in the cockpit and i was wondering
what is it
its the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit
but thats not important right now
the first officer is ill and the captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio
do you know anything about planes
the indian holds the match awaiting the outcome
well i flew in the war but that was a long time ago
i wouldnt know anything about it
would you go up please
he has a moment of indecision
the indian encourages striker with an adamant nod
striker gets up to leave
the indian relieved blows out the match
jack is sitting across the aisle from a year old conservatively dressed spinster
he pulls a flask from his coat pocket and takes a swig
she eyes him disapprovingly
would ya like a little whiskey maam
insulted certainly not
she inserts a two inch straw in her nose and snorts a couple lines of cocaine off a piece of glass
to rumack and randy the stewardess said
empty pilots seat and inflated automatic pilot
can you fly this airplane and land it
surely you cant be serious
i am serious and dont call me shirley
what flying experience have you had
well i flew single engine fighters in the air force but this plane has four engines
its an entirely different kind of flying
all together its an entirely different kind of flying
besides i havent touched any kind of plane in six years
i know nothing about flying
all i know is this youre the only person on this plane who can possibly fly it
youre the only chance weve got
dramatic music as striker turns to face the controls
camera pans controls
camera keeps panning and panning as we see more and more controls ad absurdum
insert meter ll
the businessman in strikers cab checks his watch
mccroskey to air controller tell omaha to acknowledge and standby
into phone get every piece of emergency equipment you can reach
to air controller alert at every mile of the way from here to the mountains
hinshaw grabs air controller s tummy
would anyone care for a roll and coffee
mccroskey well need a pre landing flight check
tell em im in the dispatch office and i want it here fast
its your wife
mccroskey into phone i want the kids in bed by nine
i want the dog fed the yard watered and the gate locked
and get a note to the milkman no more cheese
he slams dowm the phone
he leans his hands on the desk
mccroskey where the hell is kramer
on the wall behind him there is a picture of mccroskey leaning his hands on a desk
kramer and a mutilated carey are en route to airport
kramer is at the wheel
through rear window is obvious rear projection of passing road
into phone no we cant do that the risk of a flameout is too great
he hangs up phone
one of the passengers is going to land that plane
is that possible
possible but its a hundred to one shot
thousand to one
i know this guy
who is it
we hear a thunk
rear projection shows he has run oyer a bicyclist who stands and gives the finger
his name is ted striker
i flew with him during the war
and that wont make my job any easier tonight
rear projection speeds up to obvious fast motion
ted striker was a crack flight leader up to a point
but he was one of those men who well lets just say he felt too much inside
maybe you know the kind
now rear projection indicates car is turning and then weaving but kramer does not move wheel
it takes a certain type to perform under pressure
striker didnt have it
by now rear projection is cowboys and indians on horseback chasing and shooting at kramers car
ate his heart out over every name on the casualty lists
the upshot of it is that he went all to pieces on one particular mission
lets just hope it doesnt happen again tonight
thunder and lightning
striker is in pilots seat
rumack is standing behind him
lets see altitude twenty four thousand feet level flight air speed four hundred sixty knots course zero niner zero trim mixture landing gear balance
what are you doing
you cant fly this plane
thats what ive been trying to tell these people
elaine i havent time to put this gently so ill be very direct
everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation
mister striker is the only hope weve got
those are the flaps thats the thrust this must turn on the landing lights
he flips a switch
the plane dives
the plane is diving
jack is standing at toilet
he is jolted back and forth against the walls
flashing return to seat into mike mayday
mccroskey surprised mayday
what the hell is that for
its the russian new year
well have a parade
theyll serve hot hors doeuvres
striker flips switch and rights plane
two zero niner are you okay up there
yeah i was just trying out the landing lights
elaine and rumack exchange glances
ive got to get out of here
i cant stand it
ive got to get out of here
randy pushes up and shakes mrs
hammen by the shoulders
get hold of yourself
stewardess let me handle this
randy leaves jack shakes mrs
hammen by the shoulders
get hold of yourself
get hold of yourself
to jack get back to your seat ill take care of this
jack leaves rumack shakes mrs
hammen by the shoulders
get hold of yourself
sister angelina taps rumack on the shoulder
to rumack doctor youre wanted on the phone
sister angelina starts shaking mrs
everything will be all right
please get hold of yourself
we see a line of passengers behind sister angelina waiting to shake mrs
reads chicago international airport as kramer rushes through the lobby he is approached by a series of religious zealots
in quick succession he decks each one karate style shooting the last zealot twenty feet away with a
your attention please
flight four one seven now departing the b concourse gate six
your attention please
flight twenty seven now arriving the b concourse gate six
there is a loud crash and the scene shakes
into phone this guy doing the flying has no airline experience at all
hell be a menace to himself and everything else in the air
he pauses to listen yes birds too
kramer enters picks up clipboard and reads it
mccroskey into phone okay okay
hes a terrible risk but what other choice have we got
mccroskey hangs up phone
mccroskey well thats the whole story rex everything we know
all right steve lets face a few facts
kramer whips off his sunglasses
underneath is another pair of sunglasses
as you know i flew with this man striker during the war
hell have enough on his mind without remembering those days when well when things werent so good
mccroskey well right now things arent so good
and while were talking there are a hundred and thirty eight lives waiting on us for a decision
let me tell you something steve
striker was a top notch squadron leader a long time ago
a spear slams into the wall behind kramer
but my feeling is that when the going gets rough upstairs tonight ted strikers gonna fold up
mccroskey look rex i want you to get on the horn and talk this guy down
youre going to have to let him get the feel of this airplane on the way youll have to talk him onto the approach and so help me youll have
to talk him right down to the ground
a watermelon falls from top of frame splattering on the table
very well then
put striker on the speaker
mccroskey okay you can use the radio over there
looks like i picked the wrong week to quit drinking
he pulls a flask trom the drawer and takes a swig
kramer at dispatch radio
he picks up mike
striker striker this is captain rex kramer speaking
mccroskey joins kramer at dispatch radio
dramatic music as we see strikers ominous look of recognition
dramatically yes captain kramer
read you loud and clear
kramer sits at the mike
an air controller is standing next to him but only his mid section is in frame
its obvious you remember me
the air controller is scratching his behind
so what do you say you and i just forget about everything except what we have to do now
the air controller is now scratching his crotch
you and i are going to bring this plane in together
the air controllers hand is now inside his pants straightening out his underwear
before we start id like to say something
i know that right now things must look pretty rough up there
the air controller is now hopping around with both hands inside his pants
but if you do what i tell you when i tell you to do it theres no reason you cant bring that plane in
lets not kid each other kramer
you know ive never flown a bucket like this
im going to need all the luck there is
stand by striker
to mccroskey the one hope we have is to build this man up
ive got to give him all the confidence i can
into microphone all right striker have you ever flown a multi engine plane before
striker over hears conversation on radio
this is a goddamn waste of time
theres no way he can land this plane
route em into lake michigan and at least avoid killing innocent people
mccroskey grab hold of yourself
youve got to talk them down
youre the only chance theyve got
kramer lights cigarette
into mike all right striker now you listen to me and you listen close
flying is no different than riding a bicycle
it just happens to be a lot harder to put baseball cards in the spokes
now if you just follow my instructions
two vultures are sitting on back of strikers seat
theres no reason why you shouldnt have complete confidence in your chances to come out of this thing alive and in one piece
first i want you to familiarize yourself with the controls
later well run through the landing procedure
kramer takes a last drag on his cigarette and tosses it out the window
mccroskey plugs his ears with his fingers and ducks as though kramer had thrown a grenade
there is an all right
now id like you to disengage the automatic pilot
but watch any violent movement of the controls like you used to make in spitfires and phantoms
into microphone okay im going to unlock the automatic pilot
striker switches off automatic pilot button
automatic pilot shoots upward out of the seat
elaine is thrown to the floor
striker struggles desperately to control the plane
matter of factly just remember the controls will feel very heavy compared to a fighter
striker is fighting the wheel and the autopilot which is drifting in his way
finally he throws the autopilot to the rear of the cockpit
dont worry about that
its perfectly normal
you must watch your airspeed closely
dont let it fall below
both your rudder pedals and elevator trim will have additional play due to increased drag but you can compensate by lowering manifold pressure below
now theres one other thing
have you someone up there who can work the radio and leave you free for flying
the stewardess is here with me
the autopilot is on her back its hands clinging to her breasts
she removes it and seats it at engineers console
have her take the co pilots seat
elaine takes her seat as striker regains control of the plane
he hands elaine the mike
the radios all yours now
and keep an eye on that number three engine
its running a little hot
a little hot is blinking
striker what kind of weather are you in up there
into microphone rain
and a little ice
and a little ice
hows it handling
like a wet sponge
into microphone sluggish
like a wet sponge
patronizing all right striker youre doing just fine
to elaine its a damn good thing he doesnt know how much i hate his guts
into microphone its a damn good thing you dont know how much he hates your guts
a black dude is holding his stomach in pain
can i get something for you
cain fo gwine sho fi cun for
i dont understand
schiff a middle aged woman is seated behind the black dudes
oh stewardess i can speak jive
he said hes in great pain and wants to know if you can help him
tell him to relax and ill be back as quickly as i can with some medicine
shi gwine man chitlun down for mo sho
indignantly shi man i ain neba mo fo gwine ain
they engage in an argument in jive talk with mrs
schiff getting the best of it
she swaggers off in typical black dude fashion
sister angelina is singing to the krishnas
i sit by the telephone for hours
i love when men send me flowers
i enjoy being a girl
jack is comforting an ailing shirley
she is perspiring
how ya doing honey
oh jack im so warm
im burning up
he reaches up and opens the overhead air nozzle
air rushes out with hurricane force
as jack struggles to turn off nozzle shirley is blown about an adjacent passengers papers go flying from a briefcase a hari krishnas toga flies up revealing polka dot boxer
an extras toupe flies off
after my wife died i felt like a fifth wheel
you know so many years being with one person a very wonderful person makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair
when ethel passed away i was lost
i couldnt function socially and i couldnt function in business
well after a thing like that you wouldnt be expected to
but i think its time we stopped talking about me
a woman like you why havent you ever married
well im afraid thats a question thats all too easy to answer
i know the answer career
a smart woman like you became so involved in your work you didnt have time for marriage
i wish i could fool myself into believing that thats the reason
the truth of the matter is nobody ever asked me
you know here we are having coffee together and discussing education and business and economy
and we dont even know each others names
full names i mean
thats a lovely name
but my friends call me bubbles
randy approaches mrs
would you care for a soft drink
id be glad to
randy hands a large bottle of coca cola wrapped in a baby blanket to ms
schiff who cradles it in her arms
ooooh such a nice soft drink
camera pulls out to reveal dispatcher typing message
national weather service reporting omaha fogged in
the dispatcher attempts to remove the message but it is stuck in the cartridge
he yanks on it but the paper stretches out like rubber
the scene now becomes like a cartoon
he lodges his feet against the typewriter and pulls until the paper stretches to his face
he grumbles in donald duck voice
the typewriter snaps back and hits him
mccroskey to air controller macias get me captain oveurs wife on the phone
wed better let her know whats going on
air controller rushes in holding a piece of paper and hands it to mccroskey
steve this weather bulletin just came off the wire
mccroskey frowns and hands it to hinshaw
mccroskey johnny what can you make out of this
why i could make a hat or a broach
mccroskey grabs the note from him
oveur is in bed
phone on night table rings
she reaches for it sleepily
air controller v
yes this is missus oveur
air controller v
this is ed macias calling from the airport
theres some trouble on your husbands flight
shot widens to reveal she is sleeping with a horse
air controller v
we dont know how serious it is yet but harry ballard thought youd want to get down here right away
ill be right down
she hangs up the phone and rises
ive got to go to the airport
you can let yourself out the back door
theres juice in the refrigerator
sounding like mr
ed did you finish
was i good
oh youre all so concerned about performance
thunder and lightning turbulent weather
randy approaches mrs
schiff who is caring for a drink
would you care for another drink
no thank you im still nursing this one
she is bottle feeding the coke bottle
to bottle there just a little bit more and then burpie time and a good nap
elaine hangs up phone
doctor rumack says the sick people are getting worse and were running out of time
striker is perspiring
strikers thoughts v
echoing ive got to concentrate concentrate entrate ive got to concentrate oncentrate oncentrate
he becomes aware of echo
strikers thoughts v
echoing hell hello ello ello ello lo lo
echo echo echo cho cho o o o o o
pinch hitting for pedro bourbone manny mota mota mota mota
hysterically ted the altitude

thunder and lightning
flying nose down
a woman applying eye makeup smears it over her face
dramatic music as striker is struggling with the controls
windshield wipers are moving as though directing music
christopher statue is holding an umbrella
striker regains control of the plane
to rumack whats going on
we have a right to know the truth
to passengers all right
im going to level with you
the most important thing now is that you should all be calm because theres no reason to panic
rumacks nose elongates slightly
now it is true that one of the flight crew has been taken ill
his nose is getting longer
but the other two pilots are just fine and at the controls flying the plane
rumacks nose is a foot long
the weather in chicago is clear as a bell and theres no reason that we wont land on schedule
his nose grows through frame
safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment
into microphone chicago the passengers are beginning to panic
when do we start down
into microphone not just yet well have you in radar range any second now
to mccroskey i dont understand it
he should have been in range ten minutes ago
mccroskey into microphone gunderson check the radar range
gunderson opens door of amana radar range and peers in
there is a turkey inside
into microphone about two more minutes chief
mccroskey two more minutes
they could be miles off course
theyre on instruments
elaine randy rumack and striker are playing trumpet clarinet saxophone and bass fiddle in benny goodman swing band style
this is gonna be a real sweat
into mike gunderson let me know when you get anything
mccroskey i cant take much more of this
johnny how about some more coffee

mccroskey looks like i picked the wrong week to quit amphetamines
he pops a couple pills
fifteen reporters cameramen etc
enter with air controller l
to mccroskey steve these reporters wont leave without a statement
how much longer can the sick passengers hold out
mccroskey half hour
maybe forty five minutes
whos flying the plane
air controller enters and hands mccroskey a note
hands holding microphones are thrust into frame in front of mccroskey
one hand is holding an ice cream cone
mccroskey one of the passengers
but hes an experienced air force pilot who flew during the war so theres no cause for alarm
hinshaw take over
have the families been notified
i think florence henderson knows about it
what are the chances of bringing this plane in safely
what are the chances of returning something to montgomery ward the week after christmas
beckoning to door all right boys
lets get some pictures
three men with cameras enter and begin to remove framed pictures from walls
coming off press
superimpose series of spinning newspapers
camera zooms in to each as it stops spinning so that we can read headlines
headlines are camera zooms in to striken airliner approaches chicago
newscaster is an african in native dress with a bone in his nose
there is a graphic of an airplane behind him and he is beating on a hollow log with sticks
the camera angle changes and he switches to look into new camera and continues beating
shana they bought their tickets they knew what they were getting into
i say let em crash
screaming firetrucks police cars and ambulances
lightning and thunder
will the hospital equipment be at the airport
yes everything theyve got
how are the passengers doing
i wont deceive you mister striker
were running out of time
surely there must be something you can do
im doing everything i can
and stop calling me shirley
strikers thoughts v
ive got to stay calm
if i can just keep my wits about me i cant mess this one up
elaines thoughts v
maybe i have been too harsh with him
if i had given him more support in the beginning maybe things would be different
strikers thoughts v
its not your fault
elaines thoughts v
thats sweet of you ted
i appreciate the thought
we hear both of their thoughts simultaneously
you know elaine i just its just that i feel so wanted to tell you
strikers thoughts v
elaines thoughts v

jack is seated across the aisle from mrs

schiff is holding the bottle to her shoulder and patting it
sister angelina is singing to the two black dudes

revolving radar antenna
camera pulls out to reveal dispatcher typing message
national weather service reporting chicago ceiling zero visibility one hundred feet
with great care the dispatcher turns the knob on carriage until the paper comes out clean
relishing his victory he talks in donald duck voice
oh boy oh boy oh boy
as he starts toward the door the room caves in on him
mccroskey and kramer are at watercooler
mccroskey is filling cup while kramer drinks
mccroskey rex ive decided that the best thing to do is to foam the runway let him do a wheels up landing
itd be a lot simpler
kramer throws cup into wastebasket
filling up another cup no the risk of fire is too great
if she starts burning you write off all those people who cant get out of there on their own power
mccroskey throws cup into wastebasket
mccroskey filling up another cup well thats better than writing them all off
are you going to play god with a hundred and lives
kramer throws cup into wastebasket as mccroskey drinks
filling up another cup no
a belly landing isnt all that simple
it takes a good pilot to keep from smearin himself all over the runway
mccroskey throws cup into wastebasket as kramer drinks
mccroskey filling up another cup if striker has the guts to try this he deserves the best shot we can give him
weve gotta foam that runway
kramer throws cup into wastebasket as mccroskey drinks
taking another cup his only shots with the wheels down
ive seen foam tear a mans guts out
mccroskey throws cup into wastebasket
kramer throws cup into wastebasket
mccroskey and if striker goes to pieces
taking another cup thats a risk well just have to take
kramer throws cup into wastebasket
mccroskey throws cup into wastebasket

it takes a pilot who can handle pressure
mccroskey ease up rex

it could happen to any pilot
it happened to barbara stanwyck
i cant take the pressure
i was crazy to think i could land this plane
but ted youre the only

theyd be better off with someone whod never flown before
as striker leaves he puts autopilot into pilots seat
elaine is on the verge of tears
air controller enters
