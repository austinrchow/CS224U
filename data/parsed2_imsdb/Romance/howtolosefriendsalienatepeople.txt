written by peter straughan british fifties a melodrama
were looking at an actress glamorous young but very much in the back ground of the scene a secretary typing at her desk
a young boy sits watching the film his clothes and the room around him telling us this is england in the s
he is staring raptly at the actress
all my life ive been a looky loo
we are close on an extremely handsome young man staring past us with a dazzling smile
my names sidney young
im a journalist
beat yeah that
that isnt me
we pan right and down to our hero sidney young thirties an odd ball with a knack for getting people to dislike him
this is me at the golden globe awards in l
thats my armani tuxedo
thats a rolex sea dweller watch im wearing
still in slow motion we track back and see that sidney is at a table with several other people all staring raptly past us to the stage which is out
those people all around me theyre all famous
theyre my friends
beside him sits a beautiful young woman sophie maes s
thats the actress sophie maes
this morning she told me she would let me have sex with her if she won the best actress award
still in slow motion sophie suddenly covers her face with her hands and begins to stand
she just won the best actress award
sophie walks out of the shot
still sporting the fixed smile sidney claps in slo mo along with everyone else in the room
we track away from sidney past tables of celebrities towards an exit
my life didnt used to be like this
we push through the exit doors and find ourselves impossibly looking at
a crowd of fans held back from us by a red rope craning their necks to see us more clearly waving cheering shouting cameras flashing
rain lashes down
a caption reads sidneys life one year ago
thats what they call you when you stand out in the rain all night just to catch a glimpse of them going by
reverse celebrities walk down the red carpet pausing to wave at the fans
i used to pretend it was different for me because i was getting paid by a magazine or newspaper whatever
but thats you know
i just loved watching them
id stand outside looking in through the window and think what it would be like to somehow get inside
but there was only one way to get past the thin red line that separates the celebrities from the civilians
you had to be famous
sidney stands talking to a young pr woman at the security gate
he has a small ugly pig on a leash
she looks doubtfully at the pig
babe was a cute little piglet
harry potter used to be a cute little piglet too
what do you want
he hasnt got any id
how many pigs are coming tonight
look i was told to bring him hand him over to the producer bob milton inside
you want me to leave him here with you thats fine
no you cant leave him with me
hold on ill
she looks around helplessly
she begins to unhook the red rope
sidney tries to hide his excitement
if youre positive that youre supposed to
an older pr woman stalks over
well well sidney young
clipboard nazi type woman
she turns to the security standing beside them
the pig doesnt get in
she starts to walk away
what about me
i was talking about you
sidney and the pig are being escorted away from the red carpet by the security
the looky loos dream is that one day they will somehow get to mingle with the stars
but the industry cant allow any mingling
stars have to be kept away from civilians have to be quarantined so they dont become normal
they pass a ravishing hollywood actress walking the other way
she looks curiously at the pig as she passes
sidney stares after her longingly
tracking through the doors and into the lobby of the exclusive hotel
but after the awards come the parties the miramax party the london records party and best of all the sharps magazine party so exclusive that there are no pass alongs
no plus ones no press
we find sidney checking in at the desk
to receptionist how much
i only want to stay for one night
sidney stands in the rising elevator suit bag in his hand holdall at his feet
this is where the movie stars can finally relax secure in the knowledge they are among their own kind
we see the pigs snout poking out of the zip of the holdall
sidney turns from the mirror to face us
he is wearing a waiters uniform of white shirt waistcoat and bow tie
he is also wearing a wig and false moustache
and that is when i strike
he picks up a tray of canapes from the bed and looks down to where the pig watches him from the floor
i want you in bed by ten
and no porn
he tosses the pig one of the canapes
sidney tray in hand peers around the corner to the entrance to the hotels roofed courtyard
the older pr woman we saw earlier stands at the door a formidable presence
as we watch she greets an approaching celebrity gushingly
seizing his chance sidney darts towards the door and tray held aloft to cover his face slips through into the courtyard beyond
as sidney emerges from the washrooms now dressed only in the white shirt and black trousers
he scoops up a passing glass of champagne checks his moustache and surveys the courtyard a room full of glamour tanned skin diamonds beautiful dresses beautiful suits champagne
he stands surveying the crowd of a list celebrities in front of him dazed
you can do this
you belong here
youre a star
youre a big bright shining star
the room is trashed furniture over turned mini bar open and broken bottles all over the floor
a weird squealing which could almost be human is coming from the bathroom
the squealing stops
is everything alright
the door opens and the assistant manager walks in and stands staring around him in horror
behind him the pig emerges from the bathroom and slips out of the open door across the corridor and straight into the open lift
sidney is talking to a very famous and very drunk hollywood no when im in l
i stay at the sunset marquis when im here i always stay at the sanderson
its you know i dont feel at home these days unless im in a hotel
so what do you do
oh im a writer
got one in pre production now
you know its really weird running into you like this because just the other day i was telling the producer i thought youd be perfect for the lead
she starts to laugh
no seriously you would because you know you have this mixture of intelligence and beauty and fragility that were looking for and uh
whats the film
tits of fury
im joking im just
its a bio pic
about greta garbo
thats why i thought of you
you have those amazing cheek bones and
are they real
have you had plastic surgery
no hardly anything
a penis reduction as a child thats pretty much
she laughs again snorting into her drink
sidney cant believe this she likes him
the lift doors glide open and the pig trots out and around the corner
the pr woman is still at the door to the courtyard berating one of her staff
the pig sails past them both unnoticed and disappears into the party
a young man sits drinking at a table
he slips a little bag of ecstasy from his pocket and takes one
as the young man pushes the bag back into his pocket
the pig sits at his feet watching as the little bag slips back out and drops to the floor
the pig sniffs at the bag
the place is crammed now and hot
sidney wipes sweat from his forehead
oh god im drunk
im so drunk
i havent eaten and
you feel okay
because my rooms just upstairs if you want to lie down or or loosen any you know morals or
what is your name again
he takes a sip of his champagne and his moustache comes loose and hangs limply from his face
howd you do
the actress stares at him in surprise but sidney doesnt notice he is staring past her to where there is something of a commotion amongst the guests
the pr woman is hurrying across the room hissing into her ear piece
then to sidneys horror a group of guests scatter in panic and the cause of the commotion is revealed the pig charges into view heading straight for him
the pig suddenly skids to a halt and stares at sidney with hot eyes
the pr woman follows the pigs gaze and spots sidney
sarah get security
sidney young got in
whos sidney young
before sidney can answer the pig charges
sidney turns and legs it
we are looking over the shoulder of a tall grey haired man who stands in the shadows watching sidney run past
this is clayton harding his face hidden for the time being
he lights a cigarette with a thoughtful air and watches sidneys flight rolling the book of matches between his fingers
as the pig catches up with him and lunges at his ankles
sidney screams trips and flies through the air wig spinning free hurtling straight towards a table of startled celebrities
we freeze frame
supered title how to lose friends alienate people
we hear the opening of david bowies star
as the titles and song continue we see a protesting sidney and pig being escorted by security through the endless corridors of the hotel
a seedy flat in shepherds bush
sidney lies in bed reading a newspaper in his underwear
a phone is ringing in the next room
sidney begins to cut out a photograph from one of the papers sidney struggling with an irate clint eastwood and some security men
the phone continues to ring
will you get that
beat will you get the phone
sighing he gets up and scratching himself stumbles through to
which we see is bizarrely an office full of an odd assortment of journalists desks antiquated computers and an old fax machine
the walls are lined with past covers from sidneys magazine the post modern review
one bears a photograph of victoria beckham with the title posh spice
like fuck she is
a journalist is talking on the phone by the door
the other phone is still ringing
look we dont hate celebrities at the post modern review okay
we just dont think they should be taking themselves so seriously
for us a celebrity is a text to be deconstructed
apart from costner obviously
sidney edges past him to where a large woman and a histrionic thin man are in the middle of a argument encouraged by the other members of staff
i wouldnt do this the honour of calling it a review
its a puerile personal attack in in alcoholic prose in which incidentally you manage to misquote both derrida and lyotard
i am a
an internationally respected academic and
author of a very well received book on the history of culture and a
threading his way past couldnt one of you answer the phone
as the argument continues behind him he reaches the phone with a bored young man sitting by it
will you answer that
what do i pay you for
you dont pay me
just get the phone
the young man answers the phone
post modern review
sidney if she doesnt apologise im quitting
to the large woman george cant leave
youll have to apologise
why cant george leave
he owns the fax machine
sidney notices the young man is staring at him with a scared expression
its sharps magazine
sidney stops smiling
were not finished
they sue were finished
to the others will you be quiet
they ignore him and continue bickering
sidney picks up the phone
over phone gravel this is clayton harding
im the editor of sharps magazine
sidney is visibly thrown
ah lord vader
shooting from behind clayton hardings swivel chair all we can see is claytons grey hair his custom built desk and the enormous office in front of him
he is smoking
as he talks he rolls a book of matches between his fingers
i saw you at my party just before you ruined it with your little pig stunt
you liked that
on his desk we see a few copies the post modern review glimpses of stars on the covers catherine zeta jones orlando bloom
claytons hand sifts one copy from the others and holds it up the cover depicts clayton himself patrician handsome stern photo shopped so that he appears to be naked
a headline reads clayton harding the editors new clothes
claytons shoulders heave with a snort of repressed laughter
examining the cover i especially liked the part where clint eastwood beat the shit outa ya
sidney lights a cigarette trying to seem casual
were not scared of you harding
you want to sue go ahead and sue
its like jimmy stewart said a poor stewart impersonation you sit up there and you spin your little webs and you think the whole world revolves around you and your
well it doesnt mr
clayton is still flicking through the magazines
you go ahead and sue if you want but i warn you if you strike me down i shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine
an assistant walks in
clayton looks up
miss taylor is here sir
clayton nods and quickly throws the magazines into a bottom drawer of the desk
sidney is still talking over the phone beginning to enjoy himself
destroy me and a hundred more will spring up in my place men who care nothing for success men who cannot be bought men whose only loyalty is to
i want you to come and work for me at sharps magazine in new york
sidney stares to where the thin man is trying to get out of the door with the fax machine the large woman struggling with him
the two fall to the floor
the rest of the staff gather around them
fight fight fight
could you say that again please
we hear the sound of an aeroplane engine build as we
sidney emerges from the airport wearing his crumpled brown suit dragging his suitcase behind him
he stares around excited to be here
sidney drags his suitcase down the quiet street and stops outside an apartment block checking the address
an elderly polish lady mrs kowalski is leading sidney up the stairs of the building
this magazine you are working for
it is good
its sharps magazine
you know sharps
its sort of society fashion crime finance hollywood celebrities
sodom and gomorrah
now everybody is celebrity
you take out your breasts you are celebrity
eyeing her chest well i think it depends on the breasts but
in poland someone was famous because they had done something
pope john paul
yeah they dont make entertainers like that any more
mrs kowalski cuffs the back of his head
sidney is somewhat surprised by this familiarity having only just met the lady
she opens an apartment door
mrs kowalski shows sidney into the small and cheaply furnished apartment
sidneys boxed possessions stand in a corner
they brought your things yesterday
yup this is good
i can put my drum kit just over there and uh
she stares at him
thats just a joke
theyre just little
when do you start work
well you need to be fresh make a good impression
leaving go to bed
just what im going to do
a drunken sidney dances frenetically on a small dance floor made of squares of flashing color compensating with enthusiasm for what he lacks in coordination
the women on the floor shuffle further and further away from him
sidney walks down the street staring bright eyed at the city around him in love with new york
a sexy woman in a short dress passes him
sidney ogles her as she walks into a bar
sidney finds the sexy woman sitting at the bar
there is an empty stool beside her
sidney sidles into it
a kona please
sidney gestures to the barman to make it two
he sits trying to think of something to say
the barman returns with their drinks
raising his glass hi my names clark
the woman looks at him without expression
sidney sips his drink grimaces
what the hells that
thats a water sir
thats not right is it
put a dash of beer in that
a young woman has been sitting on the other side of sidney
this is alison olsen s smart attractive dressed in an elegant but no nonsense suit
she is writing in a notebook
she looks up and notices sidney
im sorry my boyfriends sitting there
sidney gets up and examines the stool
hes fucking small isnt he
he smiles at the sexy woman hoping to get a laugh
alison examines sidney coolly points to the drink on the bar in front of sidney
thats his white russian
hell be here in a second
can you reserve these seats
sidney sits down and turns back to the sexy woman
im a journalist
work for a little periodical you might have heard of called sharps magazine
sidney produces a card and waves it vaguely
im the cultural editor
alison takes the card from his hand before he can put it away again
to sexy woman this is a library card
reading it from glow cester
snatching it back thats
not that one
searching wallet ive got it somewhere
the sexy woman gets up and walks away
sidney watches her go bitterly
just doing my bit for the gene pool
he produces the photograph of him being held in a headlock by clint eastwood
whos that there with clint eastwood
no in the headlock
you had this laminated
oh just give it
he snatches the photograph back catching alisons glass in the process
her drink spills over her notebook soaking the page she has been writing
ive got it
he tries to blot the page with a napkin smearing the ink
just leave it
she examines the book furious
he tries to think of something to say
its pronounced gloucester by the way
are you going to get off that seat
do you know the meaning of karma
inscribing a circle in what goes around comes around
the moment is approaching when you will pay the price for being an asshole
when my boyfriend gets here im going to put my pacifist leanings to one side and encourage him to take you outside and
her cell phone rings
she answers it
beat no no its
dont worry about it
ill see you then
she hangs up avoiding sidneys gaze embarrassed and annoyed
boyfriend not coming
she stares straight ahead gathering her things
listen im sorry
do you think
she turns to him
do you think i could have his drink
alison gives him a cold smile controlling her temper
she spots a heavily made up woman walking past
you want a seat
im just leaving
the woman takes alisons place at the bar
to the newcomer hello
he slides the photograph over to her
guess who that is with clint eastwood
alison gives a small smile and leaves
sidney and the woman dance drunkenly around the room to the music blaring from sidneys stereo
the track finishes and they stand gasping for breath
im gonna powder my nose
why dont you put on something a little more romantic
she staggers off down the hall
sidney giddy with excitement searches through some lps and puts one on his old turntable
its ace of spades by motorhead
he staggers around playing air guitar for a moment
the music is suddenly switched off
he turns to find mrs kowalski standing beside the record player staring grimly at him
you know what time it is
the music blaring your door open
trying to seem sober was it
i mean shit
met an old friend and brought them back
the woman staggers back into the room her back to us
she is naked
she is also surprisingly muscular
for a little
he notices the woman
his gaze drops to below the waist
mrs kowalski turns and takes in the view
a hung over sidney wakes up in his bed light streaming through the window
he examines his reflection psyching himself up for his first day
you can do this
you can do this
he hums the fanfare from the rocky theme
sidney walks into the room still humming the theme tune shadow boxing
he opens the blinds and turns to the couch
the woman wakes up from where she has been sleeping on the couch and gazes blearily at sidney
quick coffee bob and then youve got to go
we hear the opening of brian ferrys version of the in crowd as we
as the song continues we see sidney swagger down the busy sidewalk towards us
he is wearing sunglasses and a t shirt emblazoned with a photograph of keanu reeves and the caption young dumb and full of cum
the t shirt is riding up a little over his belly
this is my city
he stops at a gleaming chrome entrance and stares up at the heywood building towering above him
as the song continues sidney still swaggering is escorted through the formidable looking security by a thin and chic assistant
the entrance hall arches above them a vast and impressive cavern of chrome and glass
this is my building
sidney leans nonchalantly against the wall of the lift examining the chic assistant and two stunningly beautiful models who are in conversation
sidney manages to catch the attention of one of the models and flashes what he believes is a rakish smile
in return he receives an icy glare
these are my models
the chic assistant leads sidney down a curving red carpeted corridor past a chrome wall inscribed with the giant logo of the magazine
they reach a set of double doors which the assistant opens for sidney
sidney walks through into
harding swings around in his chair to glare at us a cigarette in his mouth
is my boss
what the fuck are you wearing
the song grinds to an abrupt halt
sidney loses a quantity of swagger
he examines his t shirt
you like it
i brought you one
he takes a t shirt from his satchel and hands it to harding
casually he flings the shirt out of the open window behind him
next time you come here dressed like that you follow the shirt
sidney nods dumbly
how was the flight
thanks for the business class tickets clay
harding regards him gravely
that was a mistake
and dont call me clay
well if its any consolation i got downgraded anyway
that is some consolation
sidney notices that the copy of the post modern review is on the desk clayton naked
that was just a little uh
as it happens im a big fan of your earlier funnier work
snipe magazine that was
that was really good
harding stares at sidney
youve actually been a big influence on me and i really think together we can inject a bit of that snipe spirit into this magazine
now ive got a few ideas that id like to
you think youve arrived doncha
well i hate to break it to you but youre only in the first room
its not nothing dont get me wrong but there are plenty of people in this town who never made it past the first room
after a year or so maybe longer youll discover a secret doorway at the back of the first room that leads to the second
eventually if youre lucky youll discover another doorway back of the second room that leads to the third
he gazes at sidney through narrowed eyes
there are seven rooms in all
youre in the first im in the seventh and doncha forget it sidney has been listening with a frown of concentration
if i make it to the seventh room will i become a true jedi knight
harding exhales smoke and puts out his cigarette
which brings us to the subject of your sense of humour
i had a look through your magazine here
whatd you think
clayton swivels in his chair and stares thoughtfully out over the manhattan skyline
oh i thought it was
sidney digests this
clayton seems lost in thought
im going to try you out in the i spy section
sidney is hurrying to keep up with lawrence maddox s as he strides down the corridor
lawrence is canadian handsome one of the golden boys of the magazine and arrogant with it
other employees pass them as they walk heads down expressions serious
the place is a model of quiet professional industry
glancing at sidneys well sidney
weve only just met but already i perceive i am in the presence of a rare comic sensibility
i know your hi jinx gave you a certain notoriety back in olde england but things are going to be a bit different here
harding wants me to be your rabbi show you the ropes
are you aware of what we do at i spy
you photograph famous people when theyre drunk
i spy is the nations window onto high society
the looky loos read us because
well they werent there
the glitterati read us because we tell them they were there
for this system to work we have to know where there is
when we go out to clubs and things
would that would that be on expenses or
this isnt a vacation
its a vocation
maddox sweeps around the corner into an open plan office area
fact checkers and assistants buzz around
when we do go out youre going to have to wear something more suitable
what do you mean by suitable
maddox gestures at sidneys body
something that covers all of this up
he starts to check messages on his desk
sidney trying to seem at ease stares at a black and white photograph on the wall
is that mussolini
no sidney thats richard heywood
the owner of this magazine
looks a little like uh
pointing to the child in the photograph smiling whos this funny looking kid
is that his son
maddox stares at him
thats his daughter elizabeth now my wife
a subtitle materializes like a halo around maddoxs head
it reads do not fuck with me
well shes very
someone walks up behind sidney
miss olsen here takes care of the gallery openings book launches and other intellectual fare
can you find our new rookie something to do
sidney turns to find alison behind him eating an apple
she eyes him coldly
i hear the cultural editors job is up for grabs
alison sits working at her computer
sidney appears and perches on the edge of her desk
listen seeing as how im going to be sitting just over there dont you think we should try and put last night behind us
get off my desk
im not sure what im supposed to be doing
beat are you going to help me out
which way did you come in
sidney stares at her
alison takes some contact sheets from her desk and shoves them at him
chris blick exhibition opening
now get off my desk
one of the magazines gorgeous fashionistas ingrid walks past
ingrid stares at sidneys outfit thrown
a wolfish smile you going to introduce me
this is clark baxter
noticing ingrids gaze hes english
that explains it ohh
actually its sidney
clark baxter is my alias
why do you have an alias
he uses it when hes trying to pick up transsexuals
nice to meet you
she walks on
i take it you knew about bob and didnt tell me
alison inscribes a circle in the air with her finger without looking up
sidney is on the phone
he is staring at some contact sheets
hello is that the parsons gallery
yes it is
this is celia parsons speaking
this is sidney young from sharps magazine
were running some photographs from your opening of the chris blick exhibition and i just need to caption them
i was wondering if you could help me identify some of the people
man or woman
is chris blick a man or woman
are you sure youre calling from sharps magazine
yes i am
tell me stanley why have they given you this assignment if you dont know who one of the most famous artists in america is
i dont really know
hes a man
is he an old man
hes an older man yes
staring at a okay ive got two old men here so is he the fat one
you do realize that clayton harding is a personal friend of mine
whats that got to do with anything
she hangs up
sidney looks around hoping no one was listening
he re dials
is he the one with the wonky eye
she hangs up again
sidney coming back from lunch gets into the lift eating a hamburger
another of the magazines fashionistas anna gets into the lift and tries to hold the door open for an approaching friend
the doors swish shut anna pulling her hand out of the way just in time
the lift rises
its fashion sensitive
if youre not wearing prada itll take your arm clean off
anna stares at this strange man with the burger baffled
but i am wearing prada
the lift stops and she gets out
alison gets in sees sidney and winces
she takes out a book and pretends to read
the lift begins to rise again
through its glass doors we see the different floors passing different publications each a hive of sober hard work
sidney stares at them
this isnt what i expected
alison recoils slightly
what did you expect
i dont know
the algonquin circle
look at them
not one of them is drunk
its called being a professional
you should try it some time
theres something you should understand
im not really one of you
by you do you mean human
i mean the glossy posse
bunch of zombies writing about pets of the stars but acting like theyre working for the un
im here to shake things up a bit
where are you from
not that its any of your business but im from port huron michigan
small town girl
hannibal lector impersonation i bet you could only dream of getting out
getting anywhere yes clarice
getting all the way to the n
dropping the impersonation take my advice dont go taking this celebrity fluff seriously
for a moment alison is speechless with anger
the lift stops and a tall woman enters
she is expensively dressed wears chanel dark glasses an expression of granite and an air of superhuman froideur
alison exchanges the slightest of nods with her and stares tensely ahead
only sidney busy chewing is oblivious to the plunge in temperature
for a moment there is only the soft whir of the lift
then sidney begins to choke on some burger
he wheezes for a moment gagging
the woman stiffens slightly but shows no other sign of having noticed the revolting noises coming from behind her
alison closes her eyes
sidney gives a violent cough and a chunk of chewed burger and coleslaw flies out of his mouth and lands on the back of the oblivious womans prada jacket
sidney notices and raises a tentative hand to brush the offending item away
before he can move alison silently takes his wrist in a vice like grip
alison is haranguing sidney
are you insane
that was lawrences wife elizabeth
her father owns sharps
that was her
the mussolini baby
i could go back and tell her im
listen to me you do not approach elizabeth maddox you do not talk to her
dont even make eye contact with her
do you understand
am i supposed to be afraid
i dont know the meaning of the word fear
im sure there are many words you dont know the meaning of
she walks on shaking her head in disbelief
when i think of all the people who would kill to be where you are
and you lumber in here spitting food havent got the brains god gave a mollusc
why did clayton hire you
when clayton left college he started this little magazine called snipe
took aim at every self important celebrity in town
it was like my magazine but twenty years earlier
thats why hes hired me
i am the young clayton harding
he looks at me and sees his glory days
his glory days
sharps has won fourteen national magazine awards and increased its advertising pages by more than percent since he took over
hes paid millions of dollars a year
he lives in a bank street townhouse and weekends in the hamptons
clayton harding is one of the lynchpins of the media industrial complex
sidney stops to examine his reflection in a window
yeah but dont worry
i think i might still be in time to save him
the phone is ringing
sidney walks in from the bedroom changing into his old brown suit
the answer machine kicks in
over answer machine youve reached sidney young
im sorry but my answering machine is out of order so the voice you are hearing is actually me
the machine beeps
sidney smirks at his joke and is reaching for the phone when we hear the caller an older man an upper class english accent
over answer machine sidney
are you there
sidney stops in his tracks something complicated and fearful crossing his face
are you there
sidney tiptoes back out of the room
if youre there sidney answer the phone
we hear the opening of fly me to the moon by julie london
sidney sits in the car beside alison and maddox staring out the window entranced by the bright lights as they pass by
the rooftop swimming pool of a hotel
flowers everywhere including in the pool
guests mill around drinking
we find sidney working his way through the throng to where alison stands
theres a couple of hundred grands worth of food here and i swear im the only person eating it
you want some
sidney does a little nerdy dance to the music as he eats
this place is amazing
its wall to wall totty
wall to wall what
sexually attractive women
do you mind
maddox joins them
a man passes nods respectfully at maddox
look at that
all night people have been treating us like were royalty
in london the journalists motto is everybody hates us and we dont care
well now youre one of the high priests of whats hot and whats not
so what were you two talking about
sidney was just marvelling at the abundance of totty here
i dont think miss olsen approves of you sidney
sidney watches some beautiful women pass dripping diamonds
i shouldnt be here
i get thrown out of places like this
this is a mcdonalds
i hate disease parties
off sidneys puzzled look fund raisers
someones cell phone rings
all of the guests automatically check their cells
an older attractive woman walks over shes a little drunk
oh my goodness
maddox examines her coolly
lawrence barely bothers to conceal the fact he doesnt remember her
how are you
well im just wonderful
how are you
lawrence smiles and looks around him without answering
rachel tries again
funny i should run into you
ive just done this great little film called five boroughs and its you know low budget first time director but very uh moving and
hey maybe you could do a little
a handsome young man passes by
maddox instantly turns away from rachel
angelo good to see you
rachel hovers for a moment embarrassed by her abrupt dismissal then slips away
sidney watches her go feeling for her
you know that was rachel petkoff
shes a fantastic actress
hasnt done anything for years but in her day
seriously ive heard about that film
i think shes going to make a come back
we should get there first do a profile or something before everyone else
maddox isnt listening
instead he greets a fat angry looking very young man
this is vincent lepak wearing his customary shades
great to see you
children id like to introduce you to vincent lepak enfant terrible and in my opinion the most exciting new director in american cinema
vincent nods frowning looks around
i think this is the worst fundraiser ive been to in my whole life
its a rat fuck isnt it
sidney walks away
standing at the parapet smoking staring out over the city with red eyes
sidney appears beside her
arent you rachel petkoff
rachel turns to look at him
this is sort of embarrassing but
he holds out a napkin
could i have your autograph
rachel suspecting she is the target of ridicule looks around to see if theres an audience
im a big fan
is that so
i must have seen everything youve been in
those episodes of the love boat and the bionic woman
the song birds in the night
ive even seen your first ever tv appearance
the twilight zone house of mirrors
my all time favorite
a day too long
he means it you were really great in that
rachel stares at him
she hides her emotion with a bright smile
whats your name honey
she takes the napkin and pen her face glowing
ill remember that
holding court to maddox alison and some of the glitterati
sidney joins them eating more food
you look around and its all shit
no one is making movies that are fucking worthwhile
id have to disagree with you vincent
vincent looks at him displeased
youre making movies that are worthwhile
vincent accepts this with a curt nod
this is what im saying
you have to inspire yourself
i am my role model
i want to be me
he stares angrily around handing his empty glass to his waiting assistant who immediately replaces it with a full one from a passing tray
sidney watches him with dislike
greatest film ever made
whats the greatest film ever made
to alison go on
have a guess
i dont think there is one single film that
have a guess
yeah have a guess what is the greatest film ever made
i dont uh
well personally i love la dolce vita but
i beg your pardon
uhuh con air
its got everything
malkovich for your acting chops nicky cage for action buscemi for comedy john cusack for the gays
its a smorgasbord
the group study him trying to work out if this is irony or idiocy
maddox is staring daggers at him
an extremely thin fashionably dressed woman smiles at sidney
i dont think weve been introduced
mister young this is eleanor johnson queen of new york
eleanor this is sidney young
hes from england and hes our very own idiot savant
without the savant
well its always nice to have fresh blood at these things
to maddox which reminds me im here with sophie maes i want you to meet her
new film the suffragette coming out the buzz is a mazing
the release is tied in with the roll out of the reebok campaign and now louis vuittons on the line
this train is leaving the station lawrence
so youre a publicist
i dont really like that word sidney
what should i call you
you can call me eleanor
she stares past him across the pool
there she is
they turn to see a young woman standing across the pool from them
this is sophie maes a natural beauty statuesque no make up hair simply pulled back
sophie tries to walk around the pool to join them but finds she cant work her way through the crowd
she turns to her right but finds her way similarly blocked
she hesitates for a moment and then with a shrug climbs down into the pool the water up to her chest and begins to walk through the floating flowers towards
sidney stares at her transfixed
alison notices this with some contempt
gradually everyone notices sophie and stops to look
having reached the other side sophie ascends the pool steps laughing her dress clinging to her venus rising from the waves
the photographers appear snapping merrily away
oh this one will go far
sophie still in her wet dress eleanor and sophies entourage are striding through the hotels corridors on their way out
maddox sidney and alison are with them
on cell phone wheres the car
whats it doing at the back
forget what i said
i want the car at the front
sidney finds himself walking alongside sophie and maddox trying not to stare at sophies breasts
i just think its terrible the way were still exploiting animals
thats why you know i wont wear fur or leather i wont wear make up im vegetarian
im with you
sophie turns to him with a vague smile
i wont eat anything with you know eyebrows
he snickers nervously
or if it can chuckle
i wont eat animals that can chuckle
im sorry i cant understand your accent
nothing just uh
so youre an actress
have i seen you in anything
i dont know
trying again so you havent won any oscars yet
because i would certainly vote for you for best supporting dress
huh huh huh
i havent been nominated for anything
no im just
im saying you look
they have reached the front entrance of the hotel
eleanor steps between them
are you ready dear
the front doors glide open to reveal a legion of paparazzi waiting outside
as sophie steps outside there is a sudden roar of photographers shouting and the night sky blazes white as hundreds of cameras flash simultaneously
reverse the group framed in the entrance way blinded by the glare squinting
only sophie has her eyes open smiling looking like a star
the paparazzi are still crowding around the group as they make their way to the waiting car
were going on to the circle club
ill see you tomorrow
maddox slips his jacket around sophies shoulders
arent you cold
im from canada land of ice and snow
they get into the car
sidney tries to follow them
where are you going
im coming to the club
sorry youre not on the list
a small chihuahua cuba on sophies lap snarls at sidney
even cuba says so
maddox closes the door and the car glides away sophie kissing the dog on the nose
the paparazzi hurry back to the entrance as another celebrity emerges leaving alison and sidney staring after the car
that turns my stomach
pawing her like that
hes old enough to be her father
no he isnt
yes he is
i started producing sperm when i was thirteen so you know technically
for your information he wasnt pawing her
he was just doing his job
in case you havent noticed sharps has to have a star on the cover every month
and most of those stars are clients of eleanors
so do not piss her off
shes a flak
hacks dont take orders from flaks
and i dont think you can call that doing his job
the man had no blood left in his upper body
oh and next time you want to do the hilariously ironic i love con air skit would you mind
i wasnt being ironic
would you mind not involving me especially in the presence of vincent lepak who happens to be very important
yeah i could tell by the way he was allowed to stay up past his bed time
the car disappears into the distance
they watch it go
do you think shed go out with me
you think shell go out with me
girls like sophie dont date journalists
as far as shes concerned youre the help
what do you know
a lot of these starlets are lonely
they spend their time looking for a man
alison starts to walk away
this is new york sidney
women only date men who are successful
im going to be successful
as she goes and tall
sidney sits in front of his computer reading the on line new york post page six
a story on the previous night is accompanied by a large picture of sophie in her clinging dress
above the picture is the title venus envy
sidney stares at the picture entranced
alison sits at her desk watching him with contempt
maddox appears beside them
have you seen this
an assistant walks over with a muffin basket for maddox
from sophie maes
reading the card thanks for a great night
what a sweet kid
oh sidney about last night word of advice
dont talk to the celebrities okay
sophie said you made her feel uncomfortable
he walks off with a slight smirk
sidney glowers after him
sidney walks down the corridor
he slows his expression changing suddenly
v elizabeth maddox is walking down the corridor towards us face set
sidney keeps on walking staring to one side of elizabeth
as they draw level the heel of one of elizabeths shoes snaps off and she lurches sideways colliding with the wall before sprawling onto the floor in front of sidney
he notices alison watching with baited breath from the other end of the corridor
for a moment nobody moves then sidney steps over elizabeths prone form without a word and keeps on walking
alison gives a sigh of relief nods in approval and walks on
clayton heads a monthly staff meeting
a rather smug maddox is just finishing a pitch
so brads people finally got back to me and theyve agreed
weve got the whole afternoon before the shoot
harding nods approvingly
good work lawrence
okay well if thats it for
he starts to get up
so i was thinking clay
clayton pauses frowning
sidney turns to the room cocksure
i do a profile on her as if shes this complete recluse this hermit
laughing i try and track her down and you know who is the elusive paris hilton and why is she so publicity shy
he laughs for a moment
no one joins in
thats first room stuff sidney
and call me clay one more time and see what happens
harding stalks out of the room
blushing sidney stares after him nodding vaguely
as he gathers his notebook he becomes aware of the smirks on the faces of maddox and the others as they leave
alison sits with her notebook and pen
behind her some of the magazines glamorous fashionistas vicky ingrid and anna are examining some clothes
no id love these but im so fat i couldnt
get out of here
you look totally rexy
alison hides her irritation with a smile
tell vicky she looks rexy
you do look like you could do with a few more pounds
oh god thats so sweet
by the way post shoot clear out
got some gucci pants here that are way too big for us
you wanna try
another tight smile no thanks
she looks up as sidney sits heavily beside her stares at her with puppy dog eyes
alison tries to ignore him for a moment
i dont mean to be rude sidney but
what the fuck do you want
listen you know how things work around here
how am i going to get something in the magazine
alison stares at him
i thought all this fluff was beneath you
it is but
things have changed
look i know people think im a bit of an idiot and maybe i havent started off too well here but i want
he seems so awkward that alison begins to soften a little
i want to have sex with sophie maes
beat before maddox does
alisons expression turns to disgust
youre loathsome you know that
i know hes got a head start on me but im going to win her back
once i get my hooks into a girl they never get free
like ring worm
she gets up and stalks out
sidney glances through the glass partition and sees maddox walking past
the gloves are coming off
we hear the opening of brigitte bardots moi je joue as we
sidney is pitching to clayton in the elevator
celebrity trash cans
the contents of celebrity trash cans are revealed and readers have gotta guess who the trash belongs to
five bottles of jack daniels a court order and a copy of mein kampf
getting out the lift first room sidney
a small group of glitterati pass the immense line of hopefuls waiting outside the club and are ushered inside by the doorman at the entrance
sidney walks confidently up pretending to talk into his cell
the doorman stands in his way impassive
still talking sidney turns and walks away as if nothing has happened
sidney standing with a model type in the elevator
he takes a laminated photograph from his wallet and shows it to her
pointing at the snap guess who that is with clint eastwood
whys everyone say
in the head lock
sidney pitches to a closed door in the office
he is holding a large piece of card on which is drawn a tree decorated with the heads of various celebrities
its a shag tree
it illustrates all of the sexual pairings of hollywoods top stars and how they interconnect
from under the door slides a piece of paper on which is written first room
we hear a toilet flush
sidney approaches the doorman takes a ten dollar bill from his pocket and hands it to the doorman
the doorman crumples the bill up and throws it away
without a word sidney begins to walk away
he comes back and picks up the crumpled note and then heads off again
harding is eating lunch at his desk
he looks up and finds sidney staring down at him with puppy dog eyes
if i give you an interview will ya leave me the fuck alone
the song ends
nathan lane shakes hands with sidney as he sits down
nice to meet you
great to meet you nathan
im a big fan
i love that rat thing you played in the lion king
actually hes a meer cat
absently checking his uhuh
now ive been doing some research and i think youre probably quite a private man
am i right
which is fine but today i think it would be great to get behind the mask
uh i dont think there really is a mask as such and i dont wanna be a pain but what i really wanna talk about is the new play keep
it about the work you know
is that okay
so first question are you jewish
nathan stares at sidney
i dont see what the relevance of that is
the rat thing thats gotta be disneys first gay animal right
so i was wondering are you a homosexual
nathan looks like he might hit sidney
clayton glares at sidney from behind his desk
what did i say to you
what did i say to you
what did i say to you
dont upset anyone
dont upset anyone
i was just trying to
you wanna probe become a proctologist okay
you cant ask musical comedy stars whether theyre jewish or gay
from now on just assume theyre all jewish and all gay okay
sidney is on the phone
he has been idly applying magic tape to his face contorting it into a grotesque grimace
the headline of a magazine open in front of him reads everyone loves a lord why british titles drive new york women crazy
id like to apply for an american express card please
beat as in honourable
h o n
beat its a british title
across the desk alison watches him with contempt
yeah i know the queen
just fill in the form will you
sidney suddenly notices sophie maes and eleanor johnson walking towards them
sophie looks more styled than before
she is holding her chihuahua cuba which is dressed in a tiny coat
sidney disappears under the desk
we hear a rip as he yanks the tape off his face
in pain under desk oh fuck
he pets the dog who greets him enthusiastically
he likes you
well im one of the friends of cuba
he laughs sophie smiles not getting it
alison seems immersed in some paper work
so hows it feel to be a star
its so embarrassing
that pictures everywhere now
and i had no idea the dress was so see through
and people are talking like it was some kind of stunt
such a cynical age
embarrassed sidney gets up from under his desk
didnt didnt know you were coming in
lawrence is taking us to lunch at cipriani
could i leave cuba here
he doesnt like italian food
of course you can
he can stay in my office
fetch cuba a bowl of water will you
sidney stares at him
forcing a smile of course
eleanor is getting a cup of water from the cooler
sidney joins her waiting to fill the dogs bowl
that is a lovely ring
where is that from
sidney looks at the wedding ring he wears on his little finger
it was my mothers
she gave it to me
oh you sweetie
that is very very
dismissing the topic so listen
youve met vincent lepak havent you sidney
he has a new movie coming out soon and lawrence is over stretched as it is
how would you like to write a story on him
alison at the photocopier nearby listens
sidney smiles filled with hope
id love to
maybe we could get together and discuss the angle
beat what do you mean
well id need to know how were going to present vincent check the story so on
you want copy approval
any stories written about my clients need to be in their best interest thats all
if things work out with vincent we could maybe talk about a follow up story on sophie
what do you think
alison listens her face registering her distaste
sidney looks over at sophie struggling with himself
im sorry eleanor i dont
i dont work that way
alison stares with surprise at sidney
he just went up in her estimation
sidney dear think of it like this you write about one of my clients you are borrowing some of their star light to help sell your magazine
all im saying is quid pro quo
sidney is unable to hold back a snicker
their star light
eleanors face hardens
sidney watches sophie maddox and eleanor as they walk towards reception
sidney cracks open the door and peers inside
cuba sits in the middle of the floor staring at him
he emits a low growl
sidney slides into the room
im uncle sidney come to see how you are
you wanna play
you wanna little play
he takes a rubber ball out of his pocket and holds it up for the dog to see
he tosses the ball in the air
cuba runs after it and trots back stumpy tail wagging the ball in its teeth
he strokes the dog
were gonna be best pals arent we
youre going to like me more than that prick maddox arent you
he tosses the ball again which promptly bounces off the wall straight out of the half open window
cuba is already running towards the window
sidneys yell slows and distorts as we move to slow sidney springs forward leaping onto the desk and then in one bound onto a filing cabinet by the window sending
it rocking slightly forward
cuba bounding forward jumps into the air
sidney just manages to slam the window shut as
cuba bounces off the glass with a yelp and drops to the floor
sidney heaves a sigh of relief
then a metal sculpture on the tilted filing cabinet slides forward and drops with a terminal thud on the dog below
sidney stares down to the floor
sidney stands at the lift holding a bulging bag
waiting for the lift cmon
alison walks past sees him and does a double take
seeing her coming shit shit shit
thats my bag
just borrowing it
ill bring it straight back
what are you talking about
give it back
she reaches out to take the bag
sidney holds on desperately
give me the
she tugs violently pulling the bag open
a small paw lolls out
alison freezes staring at it
oh my god
it was an accident
oh my god
i was just trying to make friends
please dont tell her
please dont tell her
startled sidney darts into maddoxs office
as footsteps and voices approach sidney tugs wildly at maddoxs window trying to open it
alison follows him in
what are you doing
he jerks the window open and empties cuba out of it slamming it shut just as sophie eleanor and lawrence walk in
alison have you seen cuba
she darts a glance over to where sidney stands with his back to the window gazing at her pleadingly
from behind him comes a faint creaking sound
have you seen him
sidney hangs his head awaiting the coup de grace
sidney stares at her in amazement
behind him cubas body appears at the window rising into view on a window washing platform
a window washer stands at the other end of the cradle bobbing his head to the music in his headphones
alison stares at the dog in horror while the others talk oblivious
dont worry he couldnt have got very far
cuba trundles on up to the sky
clayton stands at the window
he is drunk
there is a knock at the door and sidney walks in
have you got a minute
clayton lights a cigarette stares out of the window
sidney comes in
did they find that rat yet
i think maybe he got out the building
congratulations on the man of the year thing
how was the lunch
i dont know
thousand dollars a plate all i could taste was ass
im kissing their ass theyre kissing my ass
beat i get this dream sometimes
someones set fire to the building heywoods sharps magazine the whole thing its going up in flames
my analyst thinks its an anxiety dream
i never tell him how happy i am watching the fucker burn
sidney isnt sure what to say
what do you want
sidney takes a deep breath
i want to do a story on vincent lepak
not a puff piece
something funny but with teeth
the kind of thing snipe would have done
everyones treating him like hes a genius and hes an idiot
clayton notices the closet door beside him and opens it
he stares at the rows of blue shirts hanging in there
he takes an armful out and examines them
look at these things
howd i get a closet full of blue fucking shirts
i dont know
i dont know either
this is an office for christs sake
whyve i even got a fucking closet
he drops the shirts
he cant believe it do it
hes an annoying little prick
go take him down
this is your shot
youre my little hit man
im your little hit man
go do it
he scuttles out
he ducks back around the door
you could call me the jackal
he ducks back out again
sidney is waiting in the lobby
a slightly spaced young woman approaches him
im sophie maes assistant
im afraid sophie isnt here right now
looking past her look i know shes in
im not a stalker
i just know shes upset about losing her dog and
she isnt here
well can i at least check that she got my present
did you send the flowers
yeah cos she doesnt get enough flowers does she
no i sent her the fish
the young woman looks suddenly nervous
in a bowl
did she get them
they were dead
all of them
it was kinda shocking
were they dead when you sent them
sidney stares at her
no they were
who sends people dead fish
alison sits at the bar staring at her notebook a pen held in her hand
a white russian sits on the bar beside her
sidney slides onto the stool beside her
she looks up and sees he is holding a glass bowl of water with three dead fish in it
my god youre like a serial killer
this wasnt me
i laid him to rest
cuba i mean
i took him over to
i dont want to know
alison checks the door looking for someone a little uncomfortable
beat well i just
i just wanted to say
about not telling them
i really appreciated it
it was good of you and and
not many people would uh
he stops tongue tied
alison takes pity on him
why didnt you
you dont need my help to screw up here sidney
i mean the only things you make are mistakes and stains
the barman arrives stares at the bowl of fish disapprovingly
can i help you
following his gaze just a couple of straws please
stony faced the barman walks off
despite herself alison smiles
sidney smiles back
he notices alisons notebook on the bar
can i ask you something
how come youve always got the notebook
is it a diary or something
am i in it
its a novel im working on alright
im a walking cliche
no a novel thats
thats pretty impressive
youre writing it by hand
i dont know
it keeps it separate from the magazine work
makes it seem special
he stares at her
youre full of surprises sister
suddenly he notices the white russian beside them
you waiting for your boyfriend
uh yeah so
whats he do the mystery guy
is he a hack too
actually hes a poet
whats he look like
just most poets you see arent really good looking are they
spend their time stuck in a room end up looking like golem
hes very handsome thank you
you know what i dont understand
youre desperate to get a story in the magazine so why wouldnt you play ball with eleanor write the puff piece
i resent being bribed to gush sycophantically about a star okay
i choose to gush sycophantically
alison stares at sidney trying to figure him out
its okay anyway
claytons given me a story
im on my way
well thats good
sidney smiles back at her
they look at each other
its almost the start of a moment
then suddenly on the tv above the bar a movie trailer begins
distracted sidney turns to watch its sophie maes new film the suffragette sophie a glamorous emily pankhurst
sidney looks back to alison but she has turned away suddenly awkward
better get going
leaving you take my advice youll get yourself a boyfriend whos going to show up once in a while
alison stares at the empty stool beside her
clayton is rounding up another staff meeting
sidney sits trying to contain his excitement
which makes it
a half page left
rachel petkoff fabulous sixties actress one of my all time favourites
just made a wonderful movie called five boroughs
i think shes poised for a come back and i think we should get there first do a profile
sidney stares at him in disbelief
he looks over to alison who avoids his gaze
lets do it
okay thats it people
did you read my story on vincent lepak
clayton frowns down at some papers feigning distraction
thats not going to work
sidney cant believe it
clayton gets up to leave
oh and for those who havent heard alison is going to be running the i spy section from now on as lawrence here has just gone up in the world
he is replacing greg roberts as deputy editor
lawrence smiles modestly as the room applauds
sidney looks like he is going to implode
maddox passes sidney in the corridor
sidney glares after him
one of your favourite actresses
youd never fucking heard of her
that was my idea
lawrence stops and turns back
so it was
you have any more good ideas dont forget to bring them to my new office
he is about to walk on but remembers something
by the way thereve been complaints about you skulking around the water cooler trying to talk to women
its inappropriate behaviour
you spend half your life chatting up the staff
when i do it its called flirting
when you do it its called sexual harassment
consider this an official warning
i wont tolerate sexist behaviour
he walks off
sidney glowers after him
lawrence is holding a meeting in his new office half a dozen heads of departments sit around drinking coffee
lawrence sits behind his desk enjoying his new authority
i know that wasnt gregs way of working but greg isnt deputy editor any more
i am and im making changes
there is a knock at the door and sidney walks in with an attractive blonde woman in a long coat and dark glasses
this ladys been looking for you
to the woman can i help you
are you lawrence maddox
the new deputy editor
well ive just come to say congratulations on your promotion
im sorry you are
im your present
the woman produces a beat box from behind her back and switches it on
she drops her coat to reveal underwear and stockings underneath
maddox stares in frozen horror as the stripper dances over to him removing her bra
a very well dressed middle aged woman knocks on the door and enters
hey mrs harding
two impeccably dressed little girls follow mrs harding into the room
oh my god
to the little girls and this is the fashion department
to ingrid wheres mr maddox now
oh hes down the hall
the staff are staring transfixed as the stripper gyrates her breasts whirling nipple tassels
with mock horror uh lawrence
this is sort of inappropriate isnt it
will you please
his words are muffled by the bra the stripper drapes over his face
gleefully sidney dances in the background
he produces a camera and starts to snap away
oh god this is
this is awful
the stripper who we suddenly realise is bob the transexual in a blonde wig whips off his her panties
there is a collective gasp from the room
sidney cant stop laughing
suddenly he notices everyone in the room is now staring at the door
he turns to see mrs harding and her girls standing shell shocked in the doorway
alarmed sidney side steps in towards bob
bob impressive breasts bared stands staring back at us
sidney in the absence of anything else to shield him with is holding bobs penis
the rest of the staff stare at us rabbits caught in headlights
after a beat lawrence peers around sidney a rictus smile on his face
hello mrs harding
sidney sits waiting obsessively cleaning his hand with a wet wipe
through the glass partition we can see clayton and eleanor johnson in the office
they are apparently discussing a mock up of a new cover for sharps
after a moment eleanor comes out of the office and sweeps past sidney without a glance
clayton appears in the doorway
sidney sits in front of clayton
i didnt know it was take our daughters to work day
i didnt even know there was a take our daughters to work day
beat you know when i told my wife id hired another brit she was excited
she still thinks youre all like something from pride and prejudice
but you sidney
youre like a british person born in new jersey
shaking his head why did i hire you
sidney stares at his feet
i dont know why did you hire me
i had an attack of nostalgia
what was wrong with my story
why did you kill my vincent lepak story
it wasnt good enough
plain and simple
it wasnt good enough
we dont do hatchet jobs here
it isnt a hatchet job
this opening quotation its only too easy to catch peoples attention by doing something worse than anyone else has dared do it before
who are you thinking of here
vincent or yourself
hes a talentless pretentious little twat who thinks cinema began with tarantino and someone needs to say it
and you told me to do something with teeth
im trying to run a fucking magazine here
sidney stares at him angry and disappointed
a free press is the last defence against the tyranny of stupidity
save me your tin pot philosophy okay
it isnt mine
first issue of snipe
oh grow the fuck up will ya
youre not robin hood and you never were
you bitch about famous people for the same reason i bitched about them
because they got invited to the party and you didnt
well youre at the party now so quit bitching and do your job
youre on your last life here you understand
one more fuck up like today and youre gone
wont you have to run a decision like that past eleanor first
for a second clayton looks like he might throw his ashtray at sidney
then he controls himself
sidney crosses to the door
he cant help himself looks like i was too late to save you after all
he walks out
sidney walks back through the magazines open plan area
co workers stop whatever theyre doing and watch him pass in silence
then slowly one of them begins to clap
someone else joins in
then someone else
soon theyre all clapping
someone gets up on their desk then another
sidney smiles faintly then
blinks out of his day dream
everyone around him is working as always paying him no attention
we are tracking through magazine staff celebrities politicians and children as they mill about the lawns of the sprawling mansion enjoying the fourth of july celebrations which are in progress
clayton greets guests the perfect host
we find sidney wearing unfashionable shorts socks and shoes
he is talking to alison
you hired a stripper
i didnt hire him
bob did it for a favour
i thought you wanted to be a success here
ruefully it wasnt me
it was clark
the famous alter ego
how longs he been hanging around
since i was a kid
anytime something got broken or the bathroom got accidentally set on fire it wasnt me
it was clark
the weird thing is he kind of took over
how old were you
i dont know twenty twenty one
well let me tell you if only you could get rid of that clark you could be a real winner
claytons not going to print anything i write
ive been on salary for six months and ive written precisely one hundred and seventy five words
on a dollar per word basis im the highest paid writer in the history of this magazine
beat hes not going to renew my contract
what did you expect sidney
vincents one of eleanors clients
i told you
i thought clayton was different
i really did
beat the only thing im good at is pissing people off and he wont let me do it
beat my glory walks hand in hand with my doom
off her look troy troy who
troy the movie
he stares around him at the other guests
everybody hates me here
youre the only one wholl talk to me
you cornered me
a little embarrassed no i mean it
youre the person whos been most you know
abusive to me
alison laughs again
they smile at each other
you want another drink
beat smiling alright
ill have a beer
sidney walks off
sidney is getting a drink at the bar that has been set up in the grounds
suddenly he stiffens watching as sophie maes looking spectacular walks over to where maddox and his circle are talking nearby
sophie my darling
looking ravishing as always
whilst the two are engaged in kissing cheeks sidney takes a credit card from his wallet and drops it surreptitiously by sophies feet
you know what i read the other day
your collection of poems the hollow heart
man theyre great
sidney reacts to this feeling troubled for some reason
you write poems
in another life
the barman is handing out drinks
and a white russian
sidney stares at the drink feeling like hes just been punched in the stomach
maddox notices him
well well if it isnt sidalee
maddox notices the card at sophies feet
picking it up whats this
but your names not hon
reaching for it its short for honourable
whisking it away as in the honourable sidney young
can i please
holding it out of so how come it says hon young
they made you sound like some korean medical student
the people gathered around laugh
they screwed it up
sidney baby you dont wanna go faking a british title to impress sophie
its the fourth of july
handing back the card were celebrating the fact that we threw a bunch of british aristocrats out
sidney smiles tightly
why dont you shut up maddox
the others look to maddox to see how he will react
maddox smiles dangerously
remember if it wasnt for us youd all be speaking german
if it wasnt for us youd be speaking french
maddox doesnt like this but before he can answer sidney walks off
alison is about to walk into the bathroom when she hears the sound of muffled sobbing and stops
she peers through the slightly open door
v elizabeth maddox stands at the mirror staring at her reflection
for once she is not wearing her dark glasses and we can see her eyes are red raw from crying
elizabeth walks out of the bathroom dark glasses back in place her face a mask once more
she walks off
alison slips out from a nearby room and watches her go miserable with guilt
sidney is staring over to where alison and maddox are standing by some trees deep in conversation
maddox is tossing nuts into the air and catching them in his mouth
muttering to himself choke
he puts his fingers to his temples as if to channel telekinetic powers
sidney realizes hardings wife is passing with her two daughters
hello mrs harding
with a look of alarm she shepherds the girls away
a tall older man dressed in white with a long white beard appears next to sidney
how are you
sidney nods gloomily
has anyone ever told you before that you have an unusually dark aura
you should walk with bare feet as much as possible ground all that negative energy
sidney examines him
youre a wizard or
im a spiritual healer
you can make a living doing that
oh god no
im a dentist
they stare at the party for a moment
you want to do some coke
rachel petkoff stands talking to some other guests
sidney notices her and walks over
rachel smiles at him distantly clearly not remembering him
turning back to the others no lawrence is a wonderful writer
i really felt like he got to the heart of me
rachel turns back to him faintly irritated
im sorry have we
we met at
another guest walks past sidney and kisses rachel
i saw five boroughs the other day and wept
sidney hovers for a moment ignored and then walks away
the guests have gathered on the lawns to watch the fireworks
there are oohs and aahs as the rockets light up the sky
in ger lernd
puzzled the guests turn to where a drunk sidney is standing on the balustrade of the porch of the house
in ger lernd
in ger lerrrrrrnd
he spots hugh grant amongst the crowd watching him puzzled
in ger lerrrr
with that he slips from the balustrade and crashes into the shrubbery below
sidney limps through the trees dabbing at a scratch on his face
he passes alison who is sitting on a tree swing lost in thought swigging absently from a bottle of wine
i said are you okay
beat no actually
i hate my life so you know im gonna get drunk
sidney nods vaguely
they stand in awkward silence for a moment
he walks off
he walks back into frame suddenly
having an affair with maddox
maddox for christs sake
the man with hidden shallows
i mean i used to think you were
i was starting to
i mean at first i thought you were a pain but then i started to think
but i mean
how can you live with yourself
alison stares at him pale blinking back tears
thats why ive broken up with him
well thats no
thats you know
beat you broke up with him
alison walks off
she walks back
which leg did you hurt
alison kicks the leg
she walks off again
sidney lies beside the pool staring darkly into the water and nursing the beginnings of a hangover
we hear faint music and laughter from where the party continues in the house behind
he notices the reflection of the starry sky in the water and reaching out gloomily to hold one of the stars
the reflection dissolves into ripples
when the water settles sophie maes reflection stares back at him
shes drunk and a good deal of the movie star mystique seems to have evaporated
you know what
theres something very damaged about you
sidney stares at her not sure what to say
sophie lies down beside the pool plays with a strand of her hair
like an animal thats been hit by a car or something
like a deer or
like a pig maybe
when they walk funny and the other animals keep away from them
little limpy pig
im drawn to sick animals
thats why i picked cuba because he had like psychological problems
her eyes well with tears poor little cuba
where is he now
she wipes her eyes rolls onto her back
jesus im wasted
are you wasted
sidney watches her
congratulations on becoming incredibly famous by the way
whats it like
whats what like
she rolls her head to look at him solemnly
its happening so fast and
its like its got nothing to do with me
its like im not even really here
she laughs softly
am i here
she turns back to look at the stars
im so hungry
would you like me to get you some food
are you crazy
there might still be a photographer around
they lie in silence for a moment
you know what would be nice though
she rubs her face close to falling asleep
probably just as well i havent got any
coke always makes me so horny
sidney opens his mouth but cannot speak
through the groups of people chatting outside the house
out of breath wizard
wizard dentist man
need wizard dentist man
sidney has virtually dragged the dentist out of his car
he is handing sidney a wrap
i will never never never forget this
he starts to hurry away
alison is weaving unsteadily towards the driveway
sidney hurries past then slows and stops staring back at her
alison stands rooting in her purse for a tip to give the valet man who is holding open the door of her car for her the engine running
what are you doing
none of your business
you cant drive
you need to go and sleep this off somewhere
firstly you are a stupid asshole and i hate you and secondly
she muses on what she was going to say next
sidney looks over his shoulder imagining sophie waiting for him
listen you try driving in this state youre gonna kill yourself
whod care if i did
suddenly she bursts into tears
surprised sidney stands uncertain what to do
ive got to go
got to go
sidney holds her to stop her falling
he stares back at the pool and then down at alison
sidney is driving
alison is still drunk
i thought i had it all figured out
a get the hell out of port huron come to new york
b do the serious journalism thing to pay the bills while i you know write the novel
c win a pulitzer
d i dont know what d was
then i took the internship at sharps and i met maddox and he was
he was so
and before i know it im writing you know ten tips for the fucking metrosexual and pretending this is what i wanted but this isnt what i wanted
thats why i hated you
i didnt know you hated me
because you were right about me
im a ghoul writing fluff
youre not a ghoul
youre a zombie
alison leans her head against the window
but he isnt the person you think he is okay
thats just a front
he thinks hes let himself down by giving up the poetry and hes unhappy
and the marriage is a sham i mean
i couldnt end it
i just couldnt and
cant take anymore look i dont need to hear this
she begins to root through her bag
need a cigarette
where are my fucking cigarettes
you dont smoke
she looks at her reflection in the window
do you think i have low self esteem
am i afraid of a real relationship
do i think an affair is all i deserve
i mean okay hes handsome and successful and hes great in bed
could you just be quiet
he realises she has started to cry
when i told him i couldnt see him any more
i dont know if he cared
i love him and and i dont know if he cares
sidney watches moved
im sure he does
hes probably just not very good at expressing his emotions
im so fucking sophisticated
i mean theres not even a little bit of port huron left right
ive got the haircut and the job and ive got the parties and ive even ive even got the affair because thats what sophisticated fucking people do
dont you know get snot everywhere
oh g god
alison lurches down out of sight and is sick on sidneys shorts
sidney is driving through manhattan the windows down
alison is asleep
whats your address
shaking her alison
alison snores loudly
sidney staggers up the stairs carrying alison over his shoulder
alison is moaning
shut up will you
youll wake the old witch up
he stops suddenly and turns
mrs kowalski glowers at him from the doorway
sidney freezes a sickly smile on his face
did we wake you
an elderly man appears behind mrs kowalski staring at sidney
sidney mrs kowalski and sidneys father richard young sit drinking coffee
richard has an absent minded air wears a somewhat shabby jacket
sidney seems to have almost physically shrunk in the presence of his father
some music is playing in the next room
alison dances drunkenly past the doorway wearing sidneys jacket
as she goes by love this song
the three stare after her
she uh she isnt actually a prostitute
alison dances back into the room
sooo sidneys dad
good to meet you
im from port huron
to mrs kowalski and you must be sidneys mom
no i am not
my dad married again too so thats cool
to richard you wanna dance
no thank you
where are my cigarettes
feeling in the pocket of the jacket what is that
she produces the wrap of coke that the elderly man had given sidney
oh hey is that
she stops herself
everyone stares at the wrap
i think it is probably cocaine
sidney closes his eyes
it wasnt actually for me
i was going to give it to this young actress
he realises this isnt helping and trails off
so hey visiting your boy
you must be pretty proud of him huh
i think you should lie down alison
hes doing just great at the magazine
alison ruffles sidneys hair clumsily
first we all thought he was kinda creepy because he was always hanging around the water cooler hitting on women
really alison i think
but i think that was pretty much an act
so mister sidney whatcha doing here
please call me richard
ive written a little book so im doing a few talks
hey im writing a book
whats yours about
dont tell me its a thriller right
no nothing so interesting im afraid
im a philosopher
have you written any
alison stops dancing stares at him something occurring to her
oh my god
to sidney you
you didnt say
sidney avoids her eye
id love to hear what you think of the book if you have time to read it
alison snorts with laughter
what would sidney know about philosophy
well he does have a masters in the subject
alison stares at sidney
she breaks into a snorting laugh again
youre shitting me
he likes con air
she stops laughing hit by a sudden wave of nausea
i dont feel very well
mrs kowalski stands up
it is time you went to bed
to sidney you can sleep on the couch
better go before i find out something else i dont know about sidney
mrs kowalski turns to richard
it was a pleasure to meet you lord young
alison stares at sidney who smiles weakly
richard and sidney sit alone
you should have said you were coming
that would have required you answering one of my calls
ive been pretty busy
which reminds me i was talking to a publisher friend of mine the other day
he mentioned that they were planning a series of introductory texts on philosophers
i wondered if you would be interested
i have a job dad
of course of course
i picked up a copy of your magazine at the airport
sidney stiffens a little
beat i particularly liked the young hollywood actress who said shed like to start her theatre career somewhere small like london or england
whyve you always got to do this
it was just a joke sidney
actually its not
because youre saying that what i do for a living is worthless and
i dont think its worthless
i just think in your heart you know you could do more with your life than
sharps is one of the most respected magazines in the world
theres a million hacks who would kill to be where i am now
you know who i interviewed recently
i dont know who
i know you dont know who that is
you dont know who anyone is
you thought brad pitt was a cave in yorkshire
but most people do know who they are okay
and most people wouldnt think that a journalist who gets to mix with stars like that was a a disappointment
i dont think youre a disappointment sidney
ive never thought that
richard stands and picks up his coat
i didnt mean to upset you
sidney watches his father struggling with himself
things havent really been that great
i dont know what it is
beat im not
richard stops turns back to his son
if youre not happy
i know i can make it
einstein said try not to become a man of success but rather to become a man of value
sidney doesnt answer
the young lady next door
she wouldnt have anything to do with your desire to stay would she
were just friends
i saw the way you looked at her
sidney considers this knowing its true
she doesnt feel that way about me
new york women dont date losers
i suppose not
but alison is from port huron isnt she
sidney stares at him
sidney peers into the room to check alison is okay
she lies asleep on the bed moonlight bathing her face
she looks beautiful
sidney stands staring at her for a moment and then tip toes back out of the room
sidney is cooking humming happy that alison is here
alison walks in feeling dreadful
i dont remember very much but im so so sorry
ill get myself together and get going
no youre all right
its nice to have the company
and that woman
dont worry about it
the last woman she caught me with had a penis so you know
youre a big step up
she notices a black and white photograph of a glamorous woman on the shelf
we recognise her as the woman on the tv at the beginning of the film
thats my mother
yeah i dont take after her
was she a model
british small parts
no she died when i was young
without thinking he fiddles with the ring on his finger
must have been pretty cool having your mom in the movies
yeah i suppose
i used to see her on the tv every now and then when i was growing up
sort of weird
he carries the plates over to her
here we go
english fry up
perfect hangover cure
sidney puts a plate of bacon eggs and sausages in front of her
alison stares at it going green
suddenly she darts from the room
sidney is tidying
he upsets alisons bag from the couch and its contents spill onto the floor the notebook is amongst them
sidney stares at it hesitates and then unable to resist opens it up and starts to read
alison walks into the room
sidney looks up guiltily
sorry i was just
he cant think of an excuse rooting through your private possessions
alison sits on the couch feeling too ill to be annoyed
i like the opening
can i read the rest of it
believe it or not im a pretty good editor
i dont know
i dont even know if im going to bother finishing it
keep true to the dreams of thy youth
alison examines him through narrowed eyes
is that from troy again
she puts her things back in her bag
ill jump in the shower and then i really will get out of your hair
sidney watches not wanting her to go
oh i forgot
i got you a present
he hands her a bag
surprised she opens it and takes out a record
its the nino rota sound track to la dolce vita
i was just walking past this music shop on the corner and i saw it
i thought it might cheer you up
alison is deeply touched
i dont know what to say
beat i havent got a turntable
beat well you can always come here to listen to it
sidney takes the record and puts it on the turntable in the corner of the room
he selects the finale music its funny and sad glamorous and romantic
they listen to it for a moment
sidney starts to dance a little
he cha chas over to her and holds out his hand
are you kidding
i could throw up on you again
alison reluctantly gets up
they dance ironically
alison laughs a little
gradually they get more into it enjoying the music a man in shorts and a woman in pyjamas cha cha chaing a summer breeze wafting in the through the open
windows behind him
some weeks later
alison sits at her desk trying to work
she looks up and catches maddox watching her with soulful eyes from across the room
she looks quickly away unsettled
sidney sits at his desk surreptitiously watching her
rain lashes against the window
alison drinks coffee
ingrid and anna are examining a rack of clothes behind her
ingrid is holding up a dress
im good thanks
honey everyone needs to change their look every now and then
especially if they have a new man in their life
what are you talking about
sidney is just about to enter the room
well that english guy is always hanging around you these days right
sidney freezes listening
alison blushes fiercely
tell me it isnt so
of course not
can you imagine
hes such a creep
sidney listens sadly to the women laughing inside
alison stares at the fashionistas annoyed by this
oblivious anna holds up some trousers against herself
these are gorgeous but im just too fat
oh dont be crazy
is anna fat
not at all
why shes so thin i could just take her little spindly body and snap it over my knee like a dry fucking twig
oh and for your information sidney young has got more going for him than most of the men in this town
she gets up to leave the others gawping after her
sidney gives a slow smile of wonder she likes him
suddenly he realises alison is about to walk out the door and catch him listening
panicking he opens the nearest door and runs in falling straight down a short flight of stairs and out of sight
alison walks out of the room and away oblivious
u on sidney staring at us
hey alison i was wondering if you wanted to
starting again hello there
listen i was wondering if you wanted to see a movie or
beat starting again
you wanna go on a date
we see he is staring at his reflection in a mirror
he slips in a pair of plastic fangs and smiles toothily
the sharps halloween ball is in full swing guests dancing in fancy dress
sidney dressed as dracula threads through the crowd
he spots alison on the other side of the room dressed as cat woman
he starts to make his way towards her a little nervous
he passes eleanor johnson and vincent lepak
vincent wears all black and his shades
i like your costume vincent
im not wearing a costume
they walk on
sidney continues through the crowd to alison
he puts his dracula teeth in
havent we met somewhere before
thats why i dont go there any more
they smile but alison seems a little nervous
ive been looking for you actually
theres uh theres something i need to
mumbling through his me first
listen i was wondering if you want to go to the movies or maybe for a uh
i cant understand what youre saying
sidney pulls the plastic fangs out
i was just saying
maddox appears and gives alison a glass of champagne
he kisses her
back in a minute
he walks off again
sidney stares dumbly after him
i wanted to tell you
lawrence has left his wife
were going to be together
she watches for sidneys reaction
maybe he does care after all right
they stand in an awkward silence watching the party
a dejected sidney stands washing his hands
maddox walks in behind him
someone said youd come as a count but i thought id misheard
sidney doesnt answer turns to leave
so alison told you we were getting together right
should have done it long ago but you know me just not very good at expressing my emotions
he watches sidneys reaction smirking
you must be happy for her what with you being friends
i thought as much
did you really think you and alison
things really havent worked out too well for you here have they
you gave it your best shot
he walks out
sidney stares after him burning
rain pours down
eleanor and vincent climb into a limousine and close the door
sidney runs up
the window glides down
let me do the profile on vincent
i dont think so
the window begins to slide up
sidney hangs onto it
you get full copy approval
itll be like youve written it
the window stops
eleanor stares at him considering
sidney looks past her to vincent
vincent think about it think how humiliating it will be for me
im begging you
vincent leans over stares over his shades at sidney
beat enjoying this you dont look like youre begging
sidney kneels down on the side walk beside the limousine
the rain pours down on him
the limousine drives away
sidney stares dumbly up at something across the street
on the building across the street is an enormous animated billboard loreal advertisement sophie maes in a gold ball gown and make up hair coiffured in classic forties hollywood style
as we watch she blows us a kiss
underneath is the slogan im here
sidney sits in front of clayton
lawrence maddox is no longer working for sharps
seems elizabeth got sick of him screwing around and kicked him out
she kicked him out
richard heywood doesnt seem to like the idea of employing an ex son in law
so hes gone
sos alison olsen
sidney stares at him
dont worry about maddox
hes already lined up something with gotham magazine
im gonna need someone to hold the fort at i spy
strictly on a temporary basis you understand
one more thing
eleanor johnson rang this morning wondering if youd like to write a profile on vincent lepak
sidney stares at him
i dont know how you did it but somehow youve made it into the next room
we hear the opening of pretty vacant by the sex pistols as we
as the song continues we see sidney interviewing vincent complete with shades
vincent is wearing a crown being photographed on a throne
sidney and eleanor are watching
eleanor is going through sidneys copy crossing lines out with a red pen
sidney eleanor and a photo editor are looking at the photos from the shoot
eleanor is pointing out a blemish on vincents face
as we watch the blemish disappears
sidney buys a copy of sharps and flicks through it until he finds what hes looking for a four page feature entitled vincent lepak long live the king
he stares at his byline at the top of the feature
an elegant apartment building
sidney is being shown around a chic apartment by a realtor
sidney is amongst the room full of writers and editors pitching to clayton who nods approval and passes on to the next item
sidney and eleanor are talking with an actor
sidney is wearing a smart suit fawning in a suitably restrained manner
sidney is interviewing the actor laughing sycophantically at something he has just said
sidney sits at his desk looking very much the part now in another expensive suit talking on the phone
his desk is crowded with muffin baskets
a courier is handing over a gift wrapped box to him
sidney opens the box to reveal a rolex sea dweller watch
sidney stares at the watch
sidney is drinking champagne amongst the glitterati talking to a producer
simon cowell walks past and high fives him
sidney throws back his head laughing at something the producer said
sidney sits in the steam room wrapped in a towel sweating
slowly the steam envelops him until he has disappeared
close on sidneys photograph looking as cool as he can
alison sits alone reading sharps staring at sidneys photo in the notes on contributors page
she smiles then glances up her smile fading
maddox is walking towards her drunk and sour faced
noticing the magazine well well
i feel like a proud papa
listen i cant stay
anderson wants me to go to some photographers exhibition
hot new talent blah blah
beat how hot is she
the new talent
do you think you could drop the little wife routine
its kind of in bad taste
alison stares at him sadly i guess youre right
quietly what goes around comes around
maddox is about to say something but changes his mind
ill see you back home
he is about to leave when he notices alisons notebook on the table
and will you stop carrying that thing around with you
its kind of embarrassing
he walks off
sidney is with eleanor and sophie who now looks every inch the movie star
sophies going to get a golden globe nomination for best actress
the nominations havent been announced yet
that is correct so we have absolutely no way of knowing whether or not she will be nominated
beat so if she is nominated we want sharps to do a feature
someone to cover the whole lead up unrestricted access the trajectory the building of this unique brand
im going to have a logo
heres the deal
sophie wants you to do it
sidney stares at her and then at sophie stunned
you can be my bitch
merry christmas sidney
this is a cover story
i think a little celebration is in order
sidney climbs out of a limousine with eleanor and sophie
the women breeze past the doorman and into the club
sidney hesitates on the thresh hold staring up at the sign above him as if its a magic portal
sidney walks in
a surprisingly small ultra a list club chic and ironic christmas decorations
sidney walks past celebrities and beautiful people
sidney stands with kevin bacon playing six degrees of kevin bacon
people stand around watching
clark gable to vivien leigh gone with the wind vivien leigh to marlon brando street car named desire marlon brando to robert deniro the score robert de niro to kevin
the crowd cheers
a very drunk sidney stands in a toilet cubicle with a young actress doing coke
uh tricky but im gonna say nietzsche

most evil philosopher
evil genius philosopher
hobbes proto nazi heidegger actual nazi hegel twat
basically your hs
most hollywood philosopher
whatd he say
esse est percipi

oh honey tell me something i dont know
sidney stoops and snorts a line of coke
sidney giddy on champagne coke and success is dancing with sophie
hes at the centre of the world
the doorbell rings
sidney wearing a silk dressing gown wanders through the room from the bedroom and opens the door
alison stands outside smiling at him
it was a gift
i did a piece
he still hasnt invited her in
i just wanted to say i heard about you getting the promotion
im happy for you
hows things with you and
im working for this little literary magazine

alison stands awkwardly for a moment smiling then turns to go
hows the novel coming along
still working on it

i believe in you
alison smiles touched
i never gave you these
he takes some papers from a shelf and hands them to her
alison looks at them the are titled notes on alisons novel
theres a lot of them
alison looks past sidney to the bedroom door where ingrid the fashionista stands in her underwear
a little wave hey alice
sidney looks at her and back at alison
he gives a little laugh
half joking half how did it all go so wrong
alison smiles gives a little wave and walks away before he can see how upset she is
sophie and her entourage including sidney and eleanor climb out of a line of limousines and walk into the hotel
sidney stands for a moment looking around him
hes finally here
we hear the opening of virgina plain by roxy music
we are swooping in towards the hotel and an enormous billboard advertisement for sophies new film in pre production
its a re make of singing in the rain with russel crowe
we boom down from sophies fifteen foot laughing face to find sidney standing on a slim ledge outside his hotel window
he is drunk and wearing only his underwear
he is also yelling with fear
the window behind him is crowded with people shrieking with laughter
gingerly he edges back to the window and climbs back into
its a wild party
music is blaring people are dancing drinking laughing
you didnt do it
you let me down
you couldnt do it
sophie calmly unzips her dress and steps out of it standing in her underwear
there is applause from the on lookers
calmly she steps out of the window onto the ledge and disappears from sight
the on lookers crane out of the window yelling encouragement
after a moment sophie appears at another window further along the wall and climbs back into the room to ecstatic applause
she stares imperiously at sidney
what are you
your limpy pig
im your limpy pig
okay limpy pig
you need to pay a forfeit
ive got my little limpy dance
sidney dances a little jiggling up and down
give me your ring
sidney stops dancing his smile fading a little
give me the ring
i want it
sophie stares at him through narrowed eyes
okay give me the ring and if i win tomorrow ill let you have sex with me
the on lookers shriek with delight
sidney stares at her
he looks past her to his reflection in the window a drunk man in his underwear swaying from side to side
sidney is back in his own room alone a mess
he sits on the floor chopping lines of coke on the coffee table
he stares groggily at the space on his finger where his ring used to be
muttering to himself youre a star
youre a big bright shining star
he snorts a line and leaning back flicks blankly through tv channels a sports programme a news station a sit com re run
he snorts another line flicks stations more sports a music video a black and white movie
sidney stops staring at the screen
tv screen were watching the fifties british movie we saw at the beginning of the film
sidneys mother is typing at the desk in the background
she gets up from the desk and walks into another office
sidney stares frozen
sidneys mother passes the lead actress who is staring out of the window smoking
she stares at her sympathetically
celia johnson accent dont worry mary
youll meet him one day
how will i know when i do
oh when you meet the one youll know
she walks on
sidney stares at the screen
a conveyor belt of limousines arriving outside the hilton
celebrities wave to the watching crowds as they make their way up the red carpet cameras flash
sophie emerges from a limo looking amazing
she is wearing a fur wrap
she makes her way up the carpet sidney walks behind smiling vaguely
various celebrities are being interviewed
sidney stands a little apart lost in thought
look at you
lawrence maddox stands beside him something nervous in his manner now the old confidence gone
he has been drinking
made it all the way to the seventh room
he holds out his hand
the wheel of fortune right
you go up i go down
youre here with sophie
how about doing your old rabbi a favour and putting in a good word for me
maybe a little interview
sidney absent mindedly takes his hand looking past him
is alison here
no we went our separate ways
actually she left me
tells me shes in love with someone else
sidney stares at him
nope not you im afraid sidalee
she threw us both over
some guy named clark
can you believe it
but these are the sacrifices we make right
i dont need to tell you
its not a vacation
its a vocation
so listen about sophie
but sidney is no longer listening
slow motion we move in on sidney sitting at the table listening to the best actress award
this is where we first met him
this is me at the golden globes
thats my armani tuxedo
thats a rolex sea dweller watch im wearing
im at the centre of everything
im right where i wanted to be
beside him sophie covers her face with her hands and starts to stand having just won best actress
sidney stares at her hands she is wearing his gold ring
we move back into real time sound swells up thunderous applause
sidney claps along with the others
then he stands up and goes after sophie
taking her arm i need my ring back
sophie turns back to him her smile fixed
i need my ring back
as if puzzled by her inability to make it to the stage sophie still smiling tries to pull her arm free
eleanor is instantly beside them trying to disengage sidneys hand
smiling hissing what are you doing
let her go
she isnt the one
my mother gave me that ring and told me i had to give it to the one
she isnt the one
the applause is still going strong
tv cameras move in on sophie as she starts to struggle her smile slipping
sidney tries to pull the ring free from her finger
officials move in
what the fuck are you doing
i dont want to be on the inside
i dont want to be at the party
i dont want to have have sex with you
beat i sophie stares at him for a moment then with a shriek launches herself at him
they tumble backwards
the officials rush upon them
there are gasps from the other tables people standing up to see whats going on
mrs kowalski sits watching the pandemonium on tv
on the tv you fucking mother fucking fucker
soddom and gomarrah
the sharps fashionistas are gathered watching the awards on tv in silent horror
sophie kicks out at sidney ripping her dress in the process
oh god no
not the versace
security pile on sidney
richard young sits watching the awards on tv
he gives a small smile
alison sits watching on a tv in the corner of the bar
on tv losing it youre finished
alison begins to smile
sidney bursts free from the scrum of security and begins to run across the room overturning a table in the process officials racing after him
sidney sprints for the doors
he notices vincent lepaks startled face as he passes it
he stops ducks back and slaps the back of vincents head knocking the shades onto the floor
sidney stamps on them and runs on
vincent gapes after him
watching from his table as the people around him stand up to see the chase
he shakes his head in horror and then tries and fails to restrain a sudden bark of laughter
sidney bursts out of the hotel onto the red carpet and is momentarily stopped by the sight of the massed paparazzi ahead behind the red rope
the paparazzi stare back at sidney his face bruised shirt collar ripped equally nonplussed
there is a frozen moment then sidney plunges forward ducking under the red rope back amongst his own kind pushing through them until he disappears amongst the crowd
sidney stands at the desk
the next available flight is ten am sir
gets you into new york six thirty pm
sidney sits in the almost deserted terminal waiting for the flight back to new york
he is still wearing his dishevelled tux
he looks down at his tightly clenched hand and slowly opens his fingers to reveal his ring
sidney is in a cab still wearing his tux his travel bag slung over shoulder
he stares out as the cab passes the entrance to a park
a sign advertises an outdoor screening of la dolce vita
stop the car
an outdoor cinema has been set up
la dolce vita is playing on a large screen
a crowd sits around the park watching the movie
sidney stands scanning the crowd
he locates alison sitting near the back
she is holding her notebook watching the movie
beside her is the remains of a picnic with lit candles
sidney smiles and starts towards her then stops
she is sitting next to a man
as sidney watches she rests her head on his shoulder
sidney watches numb then turns to walk away
bob stands in front of him in full drag waving frantically
he starts to run towards sidney who sighs and closes his eyes as if things werent bad enough
then bob runs straight past him
sidney turns to see the man next to alison standing up to embrace bob
the two kiss
alison watches bob and her friend embrace with a touch of sadness
suddenly she realises someone is standing beside her
she looks up and sees sidney
she stares at him
sidney holds out his hand
alison hesitates and then takes his hand and stands up
hows the novel
he takes the notebook from her and tosses it back onto the picnic blanket
then he kisses her
as he does so he takes the ring and slips it into alisons coat pocket
then they begin to dance cha cha chaaing happily at the back of the park as the music swells lit by the flickering light from the screen
suddenly sidney freezes staring over alisons shoulder to where we can see he has accidentally thrown her notebook onto a lit candle
it is now on fire
sidney shoves alison aside and dives for the book
