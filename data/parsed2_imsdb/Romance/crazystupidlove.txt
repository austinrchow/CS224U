these feet arent nuzzling
theres distance here

white sneakers in fancy french restaurant
cal pulls out reading glasses looks at the menu

tracy is lost in thought gazing at a menu

jessica chases after molly
jessicas skinny wears glasses a hipster t shirt
in five years shes going to make all the boys heads spin

she grabs molly and tickles her
molly squeals with delight
as she kicks
a picture falls off the nearby console
jessica picks it up cal and tracy

molly giggles runs upstairs

she eyes cal affectionately
meanwhile two young professional women drink and laugh at a table
hannah is clearly buzzed

her best friend liz laughs

boring workaholic sexually repressed
but hes not very funny thats all

she motions off to the side
the hot piece thats been checking you out for the last hour
the crowd parts revealing jacob palmer
the smoothest coolest son of a bitch youve ever seen
he tilts his glass at them toasting
meanwhile cal sits in the passenger seat dazed
a to go box from the french restaurant in his lap
arent you going to say anything
almost twenty five years of marriage you have nothing to say
she looks at him
he turns to her about to say something then
turns back forward
meanwhile jessica the baby sitter stops at a bedroom door
she hears music coming from inside puts her ear to the door
its lady gaga
she smiles knocks and opens the door at the same time
hey your sisters asleep just checking youre alive she screams as robbie weaver quickly covers himself up
he was masturbating
close the door
who slams the door shut
im sorry robbie
i didnt see anything i swear
robbie lies there frozen horrified
meanwhile where liz and hannah keep drinking
i dont know hannah

hannahs mouth drops open

its jacob palmer the stud from earlier
who looks like a carrot
my friend hannah thinks hes sexy
i think your friend hannah is sexy

jacob sits down at their table uninvited

youll laugh afterwards and say i never do this kind of thing
then youll do it again

if you say yes well have one more cocktail each just enough to start losing inhibitions not enough to get sloppy after all i promised to satisfy you
so here we go hannah can i buy you a drink
hannah and liz share a look
what do you expect me to say to that
margarita rocks salt
she stands grabs her coat and lizs hand
okay time to go
liz doesnt move
ill go home with you you can call me hannah i dont give a liz
whispering to him another time maybe
giggling the girls leave the bar
still driving tracy looks at cal
he remains silent
im unhappy cal
ive tried not to be
weve been married so long somewhere we became
stagnant you know
he keeps staring straight ahead
okay youre not talking and you know that only makes me talk more
maybe thats good maybe thats good
theres this person
weve been spending time together
lunches meetings that kind of stuff
she closes her eyes tightly
i slept with him
tracy opens one eye taking a peek
no no kind of
i cant believe i said kind of
thats just not something you do in a kind of way
i slept with someone
i said it
i slept with someone
its the worst thing ive ever done but it feels so good to say out loud
i slept with someone
i slept with someone
i slept with someone
i slept with please stop me please say something
you met him at the christmas party
you remember that party
they had the giant paper mache wreath
i kept asking the decorator how he made it
you wore that sweater finally cal speaks please stop
the last person in the world id ever want to hurt was you cal if you keep talking im going to get out of the car
but the fact that i did that it could happen at all i think it just shows how broken we are and okay
just like that cal opens the door to the moving car and simply steps out
tracy screams as cal goes flying
she screeches to a stop as he tumbles to the curb in her rearview mirror
tracy runs to him
hes on the curb bloodied but okay
are you out of your mind
he looks up at her pleading
ill leave tonight ill sign whatever you want me to sign if youll just stop talking about it
she touches his bloody forehead affectionate
theres still something here
he stands limps back to the car
meanwhile jessica sits on the living room couch
robbie enters stands there
hes a precocious adorable masturbation addicted thirteen year old
im sorry that you had to see that
she keeps staring straight ahead
i should have knocked
after a long beat
for the record i think about you while i do it robbie
i have a picture of you and i look at it the whole time stop it
i love you jessica
and i know youre seventeen and i know i just turned thirteen which is the same age as your little brother and youre technically my baby sitter but someday soon
our age difference will be inconsequential which is good because
im pretty sure youre my soulmate
she stops looks at him and smiles gently
listen robbie were home
jessica jumps off the couch
how was dinner
oh my god mr
weaver youre bleeding
why are you bleeding
weaver told me she wants a divorce so i jumped out of the car
hope the kids behaved
come on ill drive you home
robbie steps into frame
i didnt know you were here
youre getting divorced
and you jumped out of a car
a moving car yes
im sorry you found out this way
im sorry you jumped out of a car
jessica you got your coat
cal drives now
jessica in the front
finally cal starts talking to himself
almost shell shocked
well talk to the kids tomorrow
tell them were separating
well do it together
ill have to tell nanna
uch shes gonna be crushed
but not right now
shes got enough to worry about
he trails off
another long beat of silence then he remembers his company and turns toward jessica
so i hear stanford early admission huh
i know your dad is so proud
youre bleeding real bad mr
she goes to touch his eye
out of nowhere
he starts banging the shit out of his steering wheel
are you kidding me
david fucking jacobowitz
he calms down slowly
pulls up to a driveway
sorry about that
jessica reaches for the door but stops
she takes a deep breath adorable
weaver i know you dont know me very well but ive been baby sitting for your family for three years
youre the nicest dad of any of the families i baby sit for by a country mile
youre funny and youre always really generous and youre the only dad whos excited genuinely excited to check on his kids when he gets home from dinner
now i like mrs
weaver i like her a lot but if she wants to divorce you well
then i think shes batshit crazy
cal smiles distracted but grateful
in fact and i hope this doesnt make you uncomfortable i think ive even developed a hey do me a favor can you not mention whats going on between mrs
weaver and i to your parents
its probably better they hear it from us
thats my girl
jessica awkwardly gets out of the car
thanks for listening
she smiles turns back
she freezes when she sees
hes holding cash out the window to pay her
you put this to that fake id youll need up at stanford
and with a sad wink he drives off leaving her standing there lovelorn and forty five dollars richer
cal sits at the bar drinking away his sorrows
hes disheveled a bit wobbly
he motions for the bartender
another vodka cranberry
a girl s approaches the bar
cal taps her shoulder a drunken train wreck waiting to happen
my wife is having intercourse with someone who isnt me
im sorry to hear that
thats very nice of you to say
she just told me tonight obviously it came as a bit of a shock and youre not listening anymore
the girl has turned back to a group of friends
i bet you wouldnt ignore me if i were david jacobowitz
my wife doesnt ignore david jacobowitz
to no one she screws him
something catches cals eye across the bar
we pan to
wearing his two thousand dollar suit hes now got two beautiful women fawning over him at his table
cal takes him in for a long beat turns back to the bartender and decides gay
you know these places basically a strip of identical housing units usually occupied by newly divorced dads
a woman s gives cal the tour
so its pretty no frills
unit is a lot like unit except youre downstairs so
the ground is closer
which is nice
the most depressing empty beige place ever
i guess the price is right
yeah well tons of divorced guys here
youll fit right in
cal sighs un enthused
ill take it
ooh the gym has an elliptical machine
i assume you want to get back in shape
cal looks down embarrassed
ill let you know when they fix it
cal sits at his desk doing paperwork
his boss enters
cal i just got the weekly sales report good good good
you really killed this quarter
keep it up youre going to be sitting in my seat by years end
really great cal
who told you tracy and i were getting a divorce
amy heard you crying in the bathroom
we all thought it was cancer
i have to go buy furniture now
cal stands exits
go for it
then calling after it could have been cancer buddy
cal is sitting on a plain faux modern couch
hes staring into space
a salesman approaches
can i help you sir
my wife is sleeping with david jacobowitz
i need a couch
ooh i understand
can i give you a word of advice one divorced man to another
if you dont mind
get the matching chaise killer deal
he pats the adjacent piece
cal processes this
i want it in beige
ill write you up
cals back at the bar sipping on his drink
he looks absolutely exhausted
he looks across the bar
at his usual table jacob is now wooing a new woman
cal shakes his head amazed at this guys chutzpah
a guy grabs the open bar stool next to cal
oh no im sorry im waiting for a friend
youve been holding the seat for an hour
yeah well my wife is screwing david jacobowitz so eat me
the guy shrugs walks away
cal looks at his watch puts a napkin on his drink and stands
jacob steps into frame in the adjacent urinal
cal does a friendly im peeing next to you nod
then cant help but notice that youre always surrounded by women
jacob doesnt even turn
im getting divorced
or in the process
gonna be single again
jacob zips flushes turns
dont start conversations with people while theyre pissing
he walks away washes his hands exits
a beat then so gay
cals a few drinks in now
the door to the bar opens as bernie late s rushes in
an oak tree of a man
hes carrying a shopping bag
sorry im late i had to pick something up from macys
dont worry about it here sit ive been guarding this stool with my life
bernie sits looks uncomfortable
its good to see you man
ive called you a few times
its been a rough couple of days obviously
nothing i could use more than my old pal bernie to unload on
hey we should play racquetball whens the last time we played racquetball
claire wont let me be friends with you anymore
cal takes this in
im sorry what
she said we had to choose between you and tracy
i chose you
she said no
he pulls a wrapped package from the bag hands it to cal
are you breaking up with me
claires waiting in the car
theres a gift receipt in there
bernie stands awkwardly
he pats cal on the shoulder lingers a beat too long then simply turns and exits
cal is left alone
he raises a finger at the bartender
do you have anything with a worm in it
because id like a gallon of that now
legs crossed martini in hand hes been watching cal get dumped this whole time
he pans up from cals feet
the white sneakers
bad navy blue dress socks
an ill fitting untucked dress shirt
half lidded eyes
jacob shakes his head
he says something to the woman who currently sits at the table
she nods gets up and walks away
as the bartender pours him a second shot
hes now showing pictures from his wallet to the bartender
this is my youngest molly
her two favorite things are high school musical and her mother
i hate both of her two favorite things
a sharp whistle interrupts
cal turns sees jacob
jacob motions for cal to come over
every move jacob makes is practiced perfectly cool
cal points at himself me
jacob nods yep
cal shrugs stands and wobbles over towards jacob
id like to buy you a drink cal
i already have a drink
let me buy you a drink cal
jacob motions to the bartender who nods
my wife is cheating on me with david jacobowitz yes cal ive heard
weve all heard
for the last two nights ive watched you batter every poor soul in this bar with your sad sack loser sob story
cal takes this in
you know what i dont need this sit down cal
jacobs that powerful
cals that drunk
cal im going to make you an offer its probably the best offer youre ever going to get and youre extremely drunk so its wildly important that you dont answer
until ive finished and youve taken a few moments to process what im saying
do you understand
cal goes to answer jacob holds up a finger
cal stops himself
once hes settled jacob continues as i said ive been watching you for two days now and i can say without hesitation that you are the sorriest man ive ever
seen in my life dont interrupt cal its the truth and you need to hear it
youre sitting there with your supercut haircut getting drunk on watered down vodka cranberries like a fourteen year old girl wearing a r jacket when you should be wearing a
l i dont know if i want to help you or euthanize you stop drinking out of the goddamn straw cal
cal stops drinking from the wimpy red straw
you asked me for advice before cal so im going to help you
i dont know why
maybe im just bored
maybe all my friends have abandoned me for wives and children and labradoodle puppies who cares why
why doesnt matter
the point is youve got a good face and a good head of hair and im bored as hell and need a project
so if you want im going to help you rediscover your manhood
do you remember when it was that you lost it
cal shakes no
doesnt matter well find it
and when we do when im through with you that wife of yours is going to rue the day she decided to give up on you too early
thats my offer
what do you say
cal stares at him blankly
a long beat of silence
cal goes for a drink almost uses the straw
then catches himself
he puts down the drink
mall food court thursday six oclock
im sorry what
jacob downs his drink nods at the woman now nearby
you ready to go
she nods subservient and follows him out
cal shakes his head picks up his drink and slurps the rest of his vodka cranberry out of the straw
a well maintained yard bordered by shrubs and bushes
a long driveway runs parallel to the yard
a medium sized u haul is parked in the driveway
cal exits the back door carrying a box
he loads it into the u haul and takes a last look back at a weathered playground sits off to the side
you can tell it hasnt been used in quite some time
baseball equipment lays all over the site of many father son catches
an oft used barbecue next to the house
you can tell a lot about this family from seeing this backyard
you like this family a lot from seeing this backyard
cal looks up
shes wearing sweats
its pretty obvious that shes been crying
neither knows what to say
i just wanted to say that
her voice cracks
she turns away
she gathers herself
cal steps forward
instinct tells him to comfort his wife but he cant anymore and he stops himself
she realizes this
theres something harsh and complicated about the reality of it all
tracy looks at the u haul wipes her eyes and tries to lighten things
do you want me to back that thing out of the driveway for you
ill be fine
you have trouble in reverse is all
it was two times three if you count my fathers foot
i did that on purpose
i knew it
they smile in rhythm for a moment
then they realize stop smiling
cal turns awkwardly
once im settled ill get the kids so they can see the place
he walks to the truck
tracys voice stops him
i think im have a mid life crisis maybe
can women have mid life crisis
make sure the lawn gets enough water
in the movies its always men having them and buying ridiculous yellow porsches but im not a man and i really dont want a yellow you have to fertilize once
not twice a month not once every two months
she takes a deep breath finding her balance
we got married so young cal
and im forty one
and thats so much older than i thought id be
the sprinklers turn off behind you
and i got really upset with an umpire at mollys t ball game last month like really upset like i screamed at him and wished he would die and i
started feeling like the person i promised i wouldnt turn into you know
if it rains a lot you need to shut off the automatic setting
and we havent been us not for a long time
and i dont know when you and i stopped being us but
i mean do you
cal finally turns and looks at her
i think it was when you screwed david jacobowitz
tracys face registers the blow but she nods she also understands it
make sure my azaleas get enough sun
cal turns gets in the u haul and backs out
and immediately crashes into the neighboring fence
cal leads in molly and robbie
okay well this is it
what do you think
didnt have a lot of time to house hunt but
they look around his depressing beige apartment
a pathetic tv plays the disney channel in the corner
theres a second bedroom with twin beds so you two can stay over whenever you want
youre like actually going to live here
molly looks like shes going to cry
come on now youll visit all the time
it wont be that bad
dont you love us anymore
cal takes mollys face in his hands starts tearing up
whats happening with your mommy and i
its not what either of us wanted not what either of us planned
but you need to understand that you kids have done nothing wron she bolts past cal to the tv where zac efron is on screen prancing about in a basketball
robbie and cal stand there awkwardly
dont take it personally
that shows like crack to her
can i say something with a curse
robbie nods takes a deep breath
love is fucked
cal laughs a bit of tension relieved
is that so
you in love buddy
well if you must know ding dong
they turn its jessica the baby sitter
what is she doing here
oh right hey jess thanks for
back to robbie i have to run out really quickly just for a few hours and your mother wants you to stay here while shes out hooking what
the place is
yes well thats a generous adjective thank you
anyhow jess is gonna keep an eye on you guys for a few
but i dont need a babysitter
shes only four years older than me
you need to know that
she needs to know that
i know buddy
cal musses robbies hair
my little boys growing up jess
hes in love already can you believe it
robbie thumps the wall with his head dying
molly say bye bye to daddy
no response shes glued to the television
wait where are you going
i decided to take a class
thats great mr
its a difficult time for you its important that you find new interests try new things maybe things youd never have considered trying before
cal looks down jessica has her hand on his shoulder
its a bit odd
she realizes takes it off
molly last chance
but molly is still locked on efron
thats my angel
back in a few
but dad nope
the door slams
robbie stands there with jessica awkward
tries to maintain some semblance of cool
i dont need a baby sitter
i know robbie
an awkward beat then
i love you so much jesus christ
cal pulls into the parking lot grabs a space
what am i doing
he enters still going
what the hell am i doing
he walks past a cheesecake factory
hannah girl from the bar who jacob tried picking up
shes sitting at a table with liz her friend and a group of really boring white people in suits
there are small gifts in front of hannah
holding her hand is an average guy her boyfriend richard
we pick up mid conversation
i think youre wrong
i think thats tucker
no no no
chris rock is the stand up comedian
chris tucker is the actor
is it racist that i cant tell them apart
liz nods her head yes at hannah
hannah stifles a laugh
well richard thank you for inviting me to hannahs goodbye party
the conversation has been riveting like stepping back in time
before i go a toast
she holds up her glass toasting
sweetie go into your hole and study your cute little ass off for that bar exam
well see you when you emerge
shes gonna kick that bars butt
all the dorks cheer
liz chugs her drink turns to hannah
ill walk you out
before they clear
when my girl passes were gonna have another little celebration right here
hope you can make it
its going to be a special night
richard you just give me a heads up so i can get really drunk before hand okay
you know it
hannah leads liz out of the restaurant whispers did you hear that
its going to be a special night
you think hes going to propose
at the cheesecake factory
oh god i hope not
do you really want him to
with a shrug okay
not my life i love you call me if you need anything
liz kisses her goodbye exits
hannah looks at her table
everyone is typing on their blackberries
she sighs heads to rejoin them
meanwhile cal sees jacob standing against a pole in the food court
jacob is eating pizza cool as ever
then offering sbarros
so what exactly are how much money can you afford to spend on clothes today
well start with shoes
let me see those sneakers youre wearing
cal holds up his foot
take them off
cal bends down takes one off
other one too please
cal does as hes told
jacob holds out his hands
cal shrugs hands jacob the shoes
jacob simply turns and throws them over the railing
what the hell
are you in a fraternity cal
those were my favorite shoes
are you steve jobs
im not steve jobs
then you dont need to walk around in new balance sneaker ever
cal barefoot follows jacob around the store
i think this whole thing might have been a bad idea
jacob ignores him grabs a pair of black dress shoes
any man can rebuild his entire wardrobe with sixteen simple items
i think i read that in gq
i wrote it
cal chuckles back clearly unsure what the chuckle symbolizes
numbers one and two pair of dress shoes pair of loafers
cal is looking at a pair of argyle socks
im sorry im lost do you really write for gq
jacob slaps cals hand knocking the socks away
your credit card please
we watch as jacob narrates the wardrobe essentials and as cals arms get progressively fuller in each store
cal gets fitted
two suits one black one grey
one sports jacket navy preferred
jacob leans in toward the tailor
take it in there
cal holds jeans in front of him eyes them suspiciously
one pair of quality jeans
these are two hundred and thirty dollars
cant we just go to the gap
he looks up
jacob is gone
cal runs outside
jacob is already halfway to the car
jacob immediately heads back inside and answers no cal
we cant just go to the gap
whats wrong with the gap
in hell every store is the gap thats whats wrong with the gap cal
its lowest common denominator
be better than the fucking gap cal
jacob holds up a pair of beige slacks
one pair of chinos
a cash register dings
four dress shirts
cals arms are filling
three casual button downs
in a dressing room shirts come flying over the wall at cal
cal struggles to get a sweater over his neck
two v neck cashmere sweaters and finally a long overcoat
cal stands there in an overcoat and sweater
im very warm
jacob leads cal through the store
he tosses him a tube
you rub this in around your eyes every night and every morning
what does it do
it gives you x ray vision cal
it tightens things up
the skin around your eyes looks like milton berles ballsack
cal stops examines his eyes in a mirror
oh my god it does
cal is getting his hair cut at a fancy salon
the hairdresser is young hip and beautiful
i like to use a number four on the sides and the back go longer on the top
thanks for that vidal sassoon
scissor cut tight on sides get him some texture up top take off about
he touches cals hair measures it between his fingers
inch off the top
tiffany starts chopping
jacob and tiffany wait for cal inside a changing room
what are you putting on
items one three eleven and fourteen
then to tiffany you smell great by the way
what are you doing tonight
i dont know
thats okay i do
cal calls out
you just ask her out like that
yes cal just like that
and it works
okay i feel kind of stupid but
the dressing room door opens
we tilt up
from expensive shoes to pants to fitted sweater over a fitted shirt and bright tie
the new haircut
a new man
can i blouse out the shirt a little
i like to blouse out my shirts a little
shut up cal
youd fuck him right
then realizing you would
you see that cal
the simple act of opening your mouth instantly causes tiffany to lose interest in sleeping with you
your personality is actually your weakest link
cal takes this in
well thats the meanest thing anyones ever said to me
the meanest thing anyones ever said to you is this your wife cheated on you because you lost sight of what it took to keep her content at home as
a man as a husband and probably as a lover
cals lower lip begins to quiver
yeah okay that was meaner
cal sits next to jacob
cal is wearing his new outfit
he looks great but not yet comfortable in his new gear
jacob on the other hand looks like hes walked out of a mens magazine
and he knows it
cal looks at jacob
i notice you only button your shirts up like halfway
i cant pull that off right
listen cal im going to be calling women over to our table shortly
cal rubs his hands together nervous
we should have some background on each other no
im in insurance more on the corporate side
my kids are cal the only thing i care less about than corporate insurance are your kids
heres the only thing i need to know how many women have you been with
in my entire life
no synchronized swimming
he mumbles to himself counting it out on one hand
he smiles at jacob proudly when he has to move the count to a second hand
but cal just stares at him blankly
then checking not at a time
i married young
we met in high school
he smiles remembering
tracy was so damn beautiful
you know those women the ones who can be wildly sexy and unbelievably cute all at once
i never knew how she did that
i still dont know how she does it
anyway we had a bit of a hiccup our senior year but we made it cal i literally stopped listening at tracy
okay here we go
a bit emotional i miss my wife
shut up cal
a young woman slides into the booth at jacobs side
cal extends his hand
he pulls it back
can i get you a drink amy
gets handed over to a new girl on a new night
tell me about yourself
what do you do
does it really matter
it does to me
she looks up
he looks completely earnest repeats it does to me
pan to cal just sitting there watching horrified
now with newer girl
and thats when i started writing the column for la weekly
god how long have i been talking
jacob takes her hand
listen im going to be honest its getting late and i think youre interesting
i also think youre one of those rare women who manages to be both wildly sexy and incredibly cute all at once
that was his line
lets get out of here
i know its forward of me but just
i think we should get out of here
she thinks then nods
i think we should get out of here
i think we should get out of here
waving goodbye awkwardly as jacob leaves with each of the girls in quick cuts
cal just sits there completely alone
but then a pretty girl arrives at his table
cal looks up smiles
she smiles back then she drops the bill on the table
shes a waitress
and hes been left with the tab
robbie weaver sits at his th grade desk
in the b
we hear a female teacher drone on about the scarlet letter
under his desk robbie is texting
receiving the text
the text hi jessica
fyi demi moore is yrs older than ashton k
they seem really happy
her phone beeps with a new text p

pleased with himself
the female teacher drones on in the b
while hester is forced to wear a scarlet a as punishment for adultery reverend dimmesdales a is self inflicted robbies phone beeps
a new message

robbie stares at the screen crestfallen
are we interrupting
robbie looks up the whole class is staring at him
slowly robbie stands
we head in tight on him
you want to talk about the scarlet letter mrs
here you go the a theyre both wearing i think it stands for asshole

so thanks for choosing this book mrs
thompson because this is what i need right now to read a boring confusing book about a bunch of stupid assholes who fell in love like assholes and then had
to die like assholes
im sorry for cursing
tracy works at her desk
a knock at her door interrupts
a tall man s stands there david jacobowitz
you have a second
im just a little swamped right now so
he closes the door behind him
youve been avoiding me
no i havent
you ran away in the other direction when you saw me coming down the hall yesterday
youre very fast by the way
she sighs gives up
i ran track in high school
that must be it
he turns serious
im sorry about you and cal
im also not sorry if im being completely honest
i want to make sure you know how much i like you
no i do a lot
just to clarify
i like you a lot
i had no intention of falling for a married woman
i just wanted someone to go to lunch with who didnt make me want to shoot myself in the face
but we started having lunch and talking and suddenly i was an accountant who was popping out of bed in the morning excited to get to work
that doesnt happen to accountants
ive checked with other accountants
so when the time is right for you to get back out there again officially i just
id like to throw my hat in the ring
that sounded weird
tracy laughs lightly leans forward
david youve been a great friend to me
and you were the first man in a very long time to make me feel
noticed i guess
what happened between us that night
it meant something to me
you werent the only one excited to come to work lately
but now when i see you all i see is his face
all i see when i look at you is what i did to my marriage
shes losing it wipes her eyes
you see this
im saving you from disaster david cause youre asking to pre board the titanic

before he can answer

tracy quickly picks up phone
as she talks david scribbles something on a postcard exits
no i understand

she hangs up looks at the post it
it reads simply yes
tracy looks up but david is gone
robbie sits waiting

she closes the door behind her looks to robbie
its been a rough couple of weeks you deserve a freebie
cmon i have to get back to work
they walk out together

youd really think someone would have written something better by now
robbie laughs the tension broken a bit
robbie wheels around in an office chair as tracy tries to work behind her desk
he stops noticing a photo
its an older picture of cal and tracy
they look happy
very much in love
guess i should take it down huh
she places the picture face down gently
she tries to return to her work but cant
how is he
ive spoken to him but only about bills or you kids but
how is he really
sorry thats unfair

she turns back to her work
after a beat hes dressing a lot better

robbie hesitates then adds hes sad
he looks better but
sadder too i think
i guess im pretty sad too
i heard you crying the other night and
i didnt know what to do
im thirteen years old and

i didnt want to google it
she smiles shakes her head
oh god baby youre so much like me its scary

she puts down her pen
smiles sadly at robbie
its my fault what happened with your father

he nods the most soulful thirteen year old ever
hey they need you in the conference room for a sec
they look up
tracy gathers herself stands
david this is my son robbie
robbie this is david
we work together
robbie takes him in shakes his hand
ill be right back okay honey
tracy starts to say something thinks better of it and exits
david moves into the room sits down opposite robbie
i hear youre quite the soccer player
i hear you broke up my parents marriage
he laughs awkwardly shocked
you are david jacobowitz right
um yes i am heres the thing david in the end she winds up back with my dad
hes better than you in every category except probably math
and she still loves him
robbie props the photo of tracy and cal back up
listen robbie now i know what youre thinking hes just in th grade what does he know about love
i know a lot more than you think david
just today i had a meltdown almost gave up on the love of my life
my dads having his meltdown now but long term
he wont stop fighting for my mom any more than i wont stop sending jessica texts that make her uncomfortable
and you need to know that
tracy re enters
you ready to go
mommy can we do chinese for dinner tonight
tracy waves to david as she and robbie exit leaving him stunned in the middle of her office staring at the photo of cal and tracy that robbie has left
directly in his line of sight
once then twice
its cal sneaking into the backyard
he takes a covert look inside the house
all is quiet
he gets to work
he spreads fertilizer on the grass
trims some bushes
picks off some petals from some dying flowers
its the strangest goddamn thing youve ever seen
finally he finishes
his yard may not be his anymore but its back in order
as he takes it all in
a light pops on
cal dives into a shrub
another night at the bar cals in his position jacob in his
cal sips his drink staring aimlessly forward
jacob looks at cal
cal looks great more comfortable in his new skin than when we left him
hes drinking a martini rather than a red strawed vodka cranberry
a waitress passes
without speaking cal taps the rim of the glass silently requesting a refill
its a cool practiced move
and he did it instinctively
jacob smiles leans forward
i think youre ready cal
to talk to a woman take a woman home
no im not
youve been watching me do it for two weeks
yeah well ive been watching lebron james for years doesnt mean i can suddenly dunk a basketball
cal do you remember the part in karate kid where mr
miagi keeps having the kid wax the car and the kid gets all bent out of shape because he doesnt see the point but the movements were actually building blocks
for throwing and blocking punches
are you going to make me fight someone
jacob stretches his neck trying his patience cal whats the first thing i do when a woman sits down
you ask if you can buy her a drink
and what if she says no
you order her a drink anyway let it sit there
when she asks me a question about myself
you deflect it back to her
you never answer questions about yourself
and what happens
they talk about themselves
and what do i do
you act really interested
you nod a lot
and at the end of the night
you compliment them then you ask if theyd like to come back to your place
do i ask
you confidently tell them youd like them to come back to your place
jacob bows to cal japanese style
a pretty woman stands near their table
jacob stands smiles
oh and no talking about your job your children your pathetic sexual history or david jacobowitz
okay here we go
what no im not ready for then to woman hi
jacob has pulled her over
shes attractive mid thirties
cal this is kate
jacob nods at cal youve got this and leaves them
cal smiles at kate nervous
she smiles back
cal motions for a waitress in the distance
can i buy you a drink kate
no thank you
cal smiles portrays confidence
im buying you a drink anyway kate so you might as well tell me what you want
really thank you but its okay
im guessing youre a vodka girl am i right
a nice dirty martini
no no no a grey goose rocks extra lime
cmon one drink
picture those ice cubes clinking together
cant you taste it
yes i can but
im uh five years sober so
cals face drops
the waitress approaches
what can i get nothing
we dont want anything
dont come back here ever
the waitress leaves confused
kate looks around uncomfortable
she tries small talk
what do you do cal
what do you do kate
i asked you first
i asked you second
she laughs lightly thinks hes being funny
seriously what do you do
seriously what do you do
now its getting a little weird
im a teacher
now cmon what do you do
cal nods exaggerated
im very interested in teaching
im sorry are you not going to tell me what you do
hes still nodding as if fascinated
a teacher with an alcohol dependency no less i bet thats actually more common than people realize
i should get back to my friends kate stands
cal puts his face in his hands
im supposed to deflect your questions
oh screw it im in corporate insurance
and i have children
more than one
the only thing i have one of is sexual partners that would be the woman i recently separated from because she was cheating on me with david jacobowitz who i
wasnt supposed to tell you about either
kate turns back curious
what were you supposed to tell me
i dont know that youre a perfect combination of sexy and cute it was something i said about my wife thats since been corrupted
but im tired and im at least fifteen years older than you and this sweater is called slim fitting but its really just uncomfortable and itchy
you think im a perfect combination of sexy and cute
cal looks up
thats what you took away from that
she smiles sits back down
wow an actual honest man
i dont know what to do with that
its kind of
rare around here
its nice actually
you have no idea
im kind of a magnet for these jerk offs
they charm me and i fall for it and at some point they just
never call me again
i dont understand
look at you
who wouldnt call you again
she looks up
its not a line its a genuine compliment
she smiles warmly
holy shit cal is in
what were you supposed to do next
well eventually im supposed to ask you if you want to get out of here
actually no im supposed to tell you confidently that you should come home with me
why dont you give it a shot see what happens
cal looks up surprised
he clears his throat then youre very pretty kate
and i cant tell if youre being serious but i think you should come home with me
ask me again
cal smiles and leans forward faux confident
im not asking you kate
im telling you you should come home with me
kate looks up genuinely turned on
cue music sexyback by justin timberlake
cal and kate barge in passionately kissing
gasping for breath this is my dumpy apartment that i had to move into when i left my wife
i love that youre being so honest
its so different so hot
ive never been with a woman besides my ex wife
more tell me more
im worried you have aids
only a little
she pushes him down on the couch takes her sweater off
shes wearing just a bra
she looks amazing
what do you want to do with me
show you off to my wife to make her jealous
she growls and dives on top of him as we launch the next morning a disheveled cal lets kate out gives her a big passionate kiss and closes the door
we stay on the door
after a beat it opens up as cal bids farewell to a new girl on a new morning
cal strides in a skip in his step a perfectly tailored suit on his body
everythings in slow motion
he points at someone winks at a waitress
a sad sack guy at the bar watches cal stride by jealous
cal weaver has evolved into the fucking man
hannah studies late into the night for the bar
jessica reads magazine articles on how to make him notice you
tracy eats ice cream in bed alone
robbie drags mysterious wood planks into his backyard
but were mainly with cal
a new woman exits
the door closes
it re opens as he kisses goodbye another woman
are mid conversation
it would work
youre out of your mind
what do college guys hate
what do they love
its a strip club where they can do their laundry
and yours isnt
a candy store that only sells red candy
everyone loves the cherry
look im not rejecting the psuedo cherry flavors like raspberry or strawberry anything in the erry family is allowed
but lets be real here no one wants the lemon
no one likes the grape
i like grape
well then you cant come to my store
they laugh quickly becoming inseparable
a late s couple eat dinner bernie the big guy who broke up with cal earlier and claire a bubbly little woman the polar opposite of her husband
oh i almost forgot heard some good gossip at the nail salon
for gods sake claire
its about cal
leave the poor bastard alone would you
i gave him the cologne like you told me to
we dont have to dance on his grave
what did you hear about mr
weaver has become quite a man about town if you get my drift
lots of young women coming in and out of his apartment lately
claire would you cut it out
its good for jess to know
she still baby sits for him after all
well its good gossip at the least
ooh guess what else i heard
as she continues chattering in the b
we hold on jessica
jessica waits at her locker
she spots a tall blonde girl moving down the hallway texting as she walks
madison stops walking but not texting
hey i had a question madison holds up a finger one second and continues texting
finally she stops
hey jessica whassup
i had a question for you madison
its kind of on the personal side so
my lips are
madison extends her arms begins clapping and making weird noises
jessica stares at her blankly
my lips are seals
so madison heres the thing
i dont mean to be blunt or insulting but lets call it what it is youre always sleeping with older guys right
lots of college guys ive heard
lots of them
even rumors about a few teachers
so my question is how do you do that
i mean how do you get them not to see you as
well a kid in high school
oh well first off i have a huge rack
you do yes
so that helps
yes im sure it does
you dont have a huge rack
no i dont unfortunately
so thats not gonna work
okay heres what you do
wait how old is he
like really old
like parent old
rock on jessica
thank you madison
alright you have to hook him
force his hand
make him unable to stop himself from doing what he knows to be wrong
do what i do
send him a postcard from downtown
go tmz on his ass
im not following you madis the full gyno
off jessicas blank look
a crotch shot
a nip slip
a dirty picture
you can even annie leibowitz it
tasteful but with nipple
yeah thats what you should do make it artistic
black and white
make this face
she makes a raw sexual face
well you came to me for advice thats my advice
you put those across his radar he wont see you as a little girl anymore thats for sure
madison walks off calls back
dont send it to him as a jpeg though
hell put it up on his fantasy football web site
and then your brother sees it tells your mom and suddenly youre not allowed to use facebook for a month
she leaves jessica there processing the advice
jessica exits the school lost in thought
theres a bit of commotion outside
teenagers are pointing and laughing at something
jessica pushes through and sees robbie standing atop a man made tall wooden platform scaffold in front of the school
there she is
as he rips open his button up shirt revealing a scarlet j taped to his pale hairless chest
he has recreated the famous scarlet letter tableau
he pulls out a piece of paper reads it
nathaniel hawthorne wrote in the scarlet letter no man for any considerable period can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude without finally getting bewildered as to
which may be the true
robbie puts down the paper ignoring the jeers
i am not bewildered
jessica riley is my soulmate
shes the one
i know it to be true and so now do the multitude
then deciding no multitude
robbie get down
i have marked myself with this scarlet j jessica
because your name starts with a j
its just tape and construction paper but one day i will get a permanent tattoo when im old enough that my parents wont freak out on me
i am your baby sitter and im telling you to get that does the trick
he gets down to mocking applause
jessica pulls him off to the side
what the hell are you thinking
you like the scaffold
it has wheels
took four weeks to build it
oh those are my friends they helped me wheel it down
off to the side three excited thirteen year olds wave and give thumbs ups to robbie
jessica waves confused turns back to robbie
this has to stop robbie
youll learn to love me
just because im four years younger than you
this stops robbie dead in his tracks
ive been spending time with him for a while
robbie stumbles less sure footed than usual
no boyfriend since ninth grade
no date for spring formal last hes older
i dont want my parents to know
and with that robbie literally just sits down on the ground all the wind taken out of him
it might be the cutest thing youve ever seen
who is he
it doesnt matter
do i know him
is he from town
i dont know
yes kind of
ill kill him if he hurts you
jessica tries not to smile
but this all has to stop now robbie
the speeches the texts all of it
its very sweet but it has to stop
he just sits there lost
ill see you around okay
robbie remains seated on the grass
his three friends approach
we should probably get the scaffold back on the road before dark
robbies on the couch dejected
his little sister sits next to him watching high school musical as always
in the adjoining kitchen cal is on the phone
i know its been forever
have you been getting out at all
ill bring you some of that deli you like one night okay
to other room kids say hi to nanna
oh ive been keeping busy
made a new buddy ive been spending time with him
yeah im going to see her tomorrow night
of course i miss her
you dont know how much i miss
his voice cracks
he turns sees robbie staring
he heads into the bathroom with the phone closes the door
robbie sighs turns back to the tv
cal and robbie are having a catch
robbie is listless
so youre seeing mom tomorrow huh
at my parent teacher thing
first time in a while
yeah but no biggie
cal tosses him back the ball
hey whats with the moping
theres this girl
you like her
i like pringles
this girls my soulmate
im like crazy stupid in love with her
and she wants someone else
but shes your soulmate
well you cant just give up
then quietly you did
mom was yours right
i didnt give up
i love you
i have your back always
but lets be honest here the woman told you she wanted a divorce and you jumped out of a car
it was slightly more complicated than that
and im a different guy now
youre the same guy
you just have different clothes
do you still love her
how old are you
do you still love mom
cal doesnt say anything
his silence speaks volumes
werent we talking about you
your son is in desperate need of some romantic inspiration
so set an example for your boy
dont give up
she says no
change her mind
look at you youre the man right now dad
get her back
get back my mom
robbie punctuates his pep talk by tossing cal the ball hard
cal is lost in thought
the ball sails past him and through the window of a nearby car
parents walk hand in hand into the school
its parent teacher conference night
cal sits on a small chair outside a classroom
cal looks up
tracy stands there
shes dressed down but looks amazing
vulnerable and nervous
you look great cal
oh well turns out ive been buying the wrong size suit for twenty years so
well you look great
you always look great so
neither knows what to say now
tracy takes the seat next to him
i talked to nanna yesterday
she sound okay to you
she sounded like
she worries about us
a long beat then i feel like im about to get detention
tracy laughs tension broken a bit
which teacher is this
this is the one he pulled the scarlet letter asshole routine on
hes a really weird kid isnt he
i kind of like him though
i do too
im so glad we switched the babies at the hospital
god these two are great together when theyre in rhythm
the laughter trickles away
an awkward beat then so how are things with
a beat then hows it going with david
she looks down
it wasnt about him if that means anything
no i know
cal looks at his watch a nervous gesture
you seeing anyone
you know me
no not really
because you hear things you know
another long beat of silence
cal gathers himself takes a breath and turns toward tracy
i miss you t
tracy looks up surprised
i got complacent i think
you find your soulmate in high school
youve got the game sewed up in the first quarter you know
i put in an effort when we were younger didnt i
id do anything to make you happy take you miniature golfing dancing you were such a good dancer
i had to be
you were such a good miniature golfer
he smiles emboldened
all i ever wanted to do was make you love me
and then you did really early on
and we got married so young
and i guess
i got lazy
i got boring
and im furious at you for what you did
but i dont totally blame you if that makes any sense
i shouldnt have jumped out of the car
i should have fought for you
you fight for your soulmate
at least thats what our thirteen year old tells me
tracys eyes well up with tears
hes a very strange boy isnt he
ill be honest he scares the shit out of me
she laughs through her tears
i missed you too
cal takes her hand kisses it
they turn around
its robbies english teacher mrs
better known to us as kate the teacher from the bar who cal slept with
cal freezes his lips on tracys hand
what are you doing here
looking to the sky really
you two know each other
weve met before
weve met before
this is my wife
oh so now shes your wife again
kates getting louder now
why dont we head inside
she storms inside
tracy looks at cal follows her in
kate paces in front of the classroom
im sorry im playing catch up how do you two know each other
maybe your husband should tell you
we have a mutual friend
you know maybe we should focus on robbie
yes lets do that
lets focus on robbie
kate goes to her blackboard
as you know robbies shining moment this year was when he set a school record for cursing in an eighth grade english class
she writes on the board asshole
she underlines it
are you familiar with this word mrs
shes heard it yes
so in terms of robbies progress asshole as in someone who tells a woman that hell call and never does
we were a little concerned about robbies grade on his oral book asshole as in someone who uses honesty to get a woman into bed with him but is actually
full of shit like the rest of them
because usually hes a very strong public speaker asshole as in someone who allows a woman to go down on him for forty five minutes because hes nervous kate stops
cal turns to tracy
she looks crestfallen
i can explain
tracy rushes out of the room
cal calls after her
shes an alcoholic
you cant trust what she says
kate screams in horror
cal races after tracy
kate races after cal
a three way chase tracy wait
leave me alone cal
im sober for five years you teachers and parents including jessicas parents stepping out into the hallway and following them outside
tracy races to her car
we were separated
fumbling for keys i know and i cheated so it doesnt make any sense for me to be mad at you
okay so i cant do this now cal
tracy i love you
tell her shes the perfect combination of sexy and cute tracy looks at cal stunned
thats their thing
its a funny story actually im going home
she opens the car door
yes i slept with her
i slept with our sons eighth grade teacher
gasps from the crowd
claire jessicas mom takes a picture with her cell phone
but all it did was confirm what i already knew that i love you
cal seizes the moment
before you were the only woman id ever been with or wanted to be with
and now even after ive been with eleven women youre he instantly trails off realizing
the only woman i want to be with
i dont even know who you are
tracy gets in her car and speeds off
weakly to himself im your soulmate
cal turns around to the crowd only to be met
by a slap across the face by kate
she storms off
thunder cracks in the sky
it begins to pour
cal stands there soaked
he looks up at the sky
meanwhile the rain pours down as diners scurry into the restaurant
weve been here before
the same group of boring people at the same table
liz and hannah chat off to the side
theres a cake on the table that says congrats hannah
richard stands on a chair
excuse me everyone
the room goes quiet
now if we could get our guest of honor over here
i forget what she looks like anyone remember
liz gags herself with her finger looks at hannah
hannah takes a deep breath downs her drink and walks over to richard
is this it
im so proud of you baby
i had my doubts of course
more cheesy laughter
now i did tell you that itd be a special night when you passed the bar
and im a lawyer so you know i never lie
more heckling from the crowd
liz desperately orders another drink barely able to take it
so hannah id like to formally ask you in front of all our friends and colleagues
hannah waits frozen
if youd like to become a permanent lawyer at the firm of watkins goldberg and schmidt
hannah steps back breathless
you dont have a better offer already do you
no thats great
then privately im sorry i thought
i thought you were about to propose
the room goes quiet trying to hear
no i just
im sorry i just got thrown is all
richard pulls hannah off to the side
honey im so sorry i didnt realize
no no dont be silly its fine
its definitely a possibility down the road
i think i just need a little more time
im still figuring out how i feel about us you know long term
no i know
wait youre figuring out how you feel about us
everyones now watching
liz gets a good seat excited
shes really laughing now
you know what the best part is i would have said yes
and i didnt even want you to propose
just now i swear to god i was hoping you wouldnt propose
and i still would have said yes
thats how pathetic i am
she snags someone elses drink from the table downs it
she grabs richards cheeks
i will consider your job offer thank you so much richard
hysterically laughing she walks away
as she passes liz sticks out her hand and they slap five
meanwhile jacob sits alone in the bar
he checks his watch
suddenly he looks very alone at his usual table
he shakes it off stands and approaches the table of a group of nearby women
one of them is telling a story and you know what she said
what did she say
the women look up
standing there in all his glory
he flashes his coolest smile
weve seen this before
the door to the bar busts open revealing
shes dripping wet from the rain looking almost wild
she scans the room quickly searching for
she spots him marches straight to him
for the first time he looks like a deer in the headlights
she grabs him
a long deep almost angry kiss
she pulls back
do you remember me
do you still think im attractive
do you still want to take me home
hannah nods takes his hand
she leads him out of the bar
we stay with the women jacob had just been introducing himself to
we havent been here yet
its exactly what youd expect though an elegant bachelor pad
everything just right
jacob puts an album on his record player
this place looks like something out of a mens magazine
is that a compliment
im not sure
music starts playing as tears go by by the stones
i like this song
i thought you would
jacob pours two nice glasses of scotch neat
brings them and the bottle over towards the couch
he pats the couch
hannah nods walks over sits down
jacob takes a sip
hannah downs hers
she holds out her glass for a refill
jacob raises a brow pours her another
this time she holds her nose as she downs it
as soon as she finishes choking
so is this how it normally works
how you woo a woman
you take them back to your granite countered bachelor pad put on the perfect song and make them a drink
thats how it normally works
hannah nods grabs the bottle takes a swig
and then you sleep with them
so thats what happens next
we sleep together
at some point yes i was under the impression that was your plan
she takes a deep breath admits im very nervous
im getting that
i know at the bar i seemed confident but i was more just soaking wet and cold and trying to be dramatic
he actually laughs
hannah snaps already tipsy
r rated sexy
because i know what happens next in the pg version of tonight i get really drunk and i pass out and you cover me with a blanket and kiss my
forehead and nothing happens
but thats not why im here
im here to bang the hot guy from the bar who hit on me
i dont think people say bang anymore
were going to bang
im finally going to do something exciting and dangerous and liz can blow me
hannah shakes her hands out pumping herself up
okay okay this is happening
take off your shirt
i need to stop thinking
take off your shirt
jacob shrugs stands unbuttons his shirt and takes it off
she pokes a finger at his abs
its like youre photo shopped
now take off yours
not with all that happening
she motions casually at his abs
do you prefer to do it here or in the bedroom
in the bedroom is preferable
hannah stands a girl on a mission
lets go there
meanwhile cal beaten up and soaking wet from the rain enters
he looks to his usual table in need of a friends company
but jacob isnt there
hannah lies on her back in the dim light
jacob is on top of her shirtless
theyre making out gently
this pillow is amazing
it forms perfectly to the shape of my head
im glad you like it
they resume kissing
after a beat she pulls back again
wait are these those foam pillows from brookstone
off his look
they are arent they
i always wondered who actually buys them
the hot guy from the bar buys them
she shakes her head amazed
sorry lets proceed
jacob smiles goes to kiss her
she pulls back again
you dont have one of those ridiculous massage chairs do you
you totally do
she starts laughing hysterically
how much did it cost
five thousand doll that doubles her over hysterical
jacob starts laughing with her
we can tell this is different for him
he likes her
we watch him as he realizes that
as he processes it
we watch him look at hannah
hair in her face drunk laughing completely amazing
jacob does the most unexpected thing do me a favor
ask me a question about myself
i dont want to know anything about you
cmon one question
okay fine but then we bang
now come on ill answer anything
you can ask me about my job or past whats your mom like
the question takes him by surprise
he hesitates then icy
not cruel but cold
and your father
he died long time ago
left us a lot of money which is how i have
he motions at his pillow
stuff like this
she motions at his abs
and time for stuff like that
my dad was the opposite of my mom actually
we pull back as they continue chatting
time passes as one question leads to another and then another
body language shifts
soon theyre sitting in bed sharing the scotch from the bottle just talking
then lying on their sides face to face talking some more
until finally its jacob who passes out
and its hannah who covers him with a blanket and kisses him on the forehead and begins falling in love with him
cue music as we begin a
hannah looks longingly at jacobs plate of pancakes
he notices switches plates
god hes crazy about her
he looks at the next table watches a lovelorn guy switch plates with his girlfriend
dolly down the row hands are held between couples all entranced by the movie until we reveal staring down at his hand locked with hannahs
he looks terrified
now its hannah whos asleep in bed and jacob who stares at her lovingly
suddenly he catches himself
in a series of comedic jump cuts he wrestles with the implications of whats happening to him
a big drink
fingers pulling at his own hair
and finally he loses the battle he tucks hannah under a blanket kisses her forehead and finally
gives in to falling in love with her
cal is sitting at the table that once belonged to jacob
he suddenly seems very alone
he looks towards the bar notices that same sad sack middle aged guy
he picks up his cell
tracy sits at a table flowers off to the side
her phone rings
she looks at it sees its cal
she hits pull back to reveal david jacobwitz across from her
he looks at tracy and smiles
she smiles back weakly
the awkward end of a first date
david walks tracy to the front door
shes carrying those same flowers
i had fun tonight tracy
and i was wondering if david stop
look i had a nice time which is a substantial upgrade from the rest of the
times ive been having lately
so i dont think im ready to start dating but my ex clearly is and theres a yogurt shop where they make this eight calorie ice cream that tastes like
a laxative so if youd like to take me there sometime i guess i wouldnt say no
you know thats exactly what i was thinking
its almost uncanny
this is the moment
are they going to kiss
the door opens
jessica stands there
jessica this is my work friend
hes an accountant named david
david this is my baby sitter jessica
okay david well everything sounds great
david smiles knowingly
ill see you at work
tracy stands there with jessica awkward
robbie sneaks down the stairs
from a kneeling position he can hear and see everything
how was dinner
it was just for work
its a pretty dress
tracy reaches for her purse awkwardly
so how much do i owe yo did you know your kids are the only ones i baby sit for who always want to stay awake so they can see
their dad when he gets home
i mean they fight with everything they have to keep their eyes open so they can hear what dad had for dinner or how he liked the movie
lot of kids want to stay awake for mom and your kids always want to see you dont get me wrong but not a lot wait up for dad
maybe its because hes good and hes kind and hes decent
what are you talking abo batshit crazy
she walks out the door
tracy looks confused
jessica turns explodes
she storms off
but shes gone
tracy sighs what the hell was that and closes the door
tracy locks the door and leans against it
processing what jessica just said about cal
she puts the flowers down on the table and heads into the kitchen
at top of the stairs regarding the flowers
robbie rides his bike down the street
hes got tracys flowers nestled in his handlebars
jessica enters in a huff goes right toward a drawer in her dresser
she pulls out a camera
we watch as she sets it on her dresser
hits the timer
drops her clothes to the floor
prints a photo from her camera
and places it in an cal weaver
with a heart
she stares at the envelope for a beat
just then her doorbell rings
jessica jumps started
she quickly puts the envelope in a drawer and heads for the door
she opens the front door
sitting on her stoop the same flowers that david jacobowitz gave tracy sit out front
she looks at the note
it reads just give me a chance love david j but the david j
has been crossed out and replaced with robbie
she shakes her head takes the flowers closes the door
music continues as we spy the weaver family through their windows robbie plays video games in his room
molly watching her show in hers
tracy in the kitchen
we move down the house and outside where we discover cal in stealth mode tending to his backyard
he fertilizes trims and waters
all under cover of night
cal looks into the living room
tracy has brought out ice cream a carton with three spoons
the kids race down the stairs join her and start eating
we take in the real time tableau cals wife and children his family inside
cal watching them from the outside looking in
its horribly painful
tracy looks at her kids thinks of something
she steps into the kitchen closes the door and dials her phone
cal leans toward the window suspicious
cals phone rings
he jumps to silence it
cal is looking at her inside
she has no idea
im in the basement
im trying to get the water heater working cause the pilots out and i dont know how to relight it
obviously cal sees shes not in the basement
im sorry to bother you i just

cal lowers the phone looks at her hesitates
then its fine its fine

oh there it goes

the charade is over
well thanks cal

cal hangs up
he takes one final look back at his wife as the sprinklers go off in the backyard and douse him
cal sits on his little couch between robbie and molly
molly is once again absorbed in high school musical
cal looks depressed
robbie doesnt look much better
nannas coming over tonight

your moms working till five well have to tell her
off their silence what do you guys want to do today
not looking up high school musical

she still wont talk to you

no i mean mom
just hellos and goodbyes when we pass you guys off
beyond your pay grade buddy
cal looks pained
i will say this though i got close
we were laughing
talking about old times all the things we used to do
his eyes drift to the tv
its the timeless golf scene from high school musical ii
a light bulb goes on
get your coat
robbie smiles runs off
cal turns to molly remote in hand
im gonna have to turn off the show
i have to im turning it off he just does it
he turns the tv off
molly turns towards him stares
a long scary beat
free at last thank you
cal kisses her jumps up from the couch
cal talks to a salesman
robbie and molly bounce around excited
cal talks to a different salesman
robbie and molly extend a measuring tape across the ground assisting
cal rents a truck
cal picks up materials
as he rounds a corner he runs into
oh hey cal
so howve you bernie id love to catch up but im doing something at the old house tonight and im in a bit of a rush so
thanks again for the cologne
cal takes off
molly points out her three favorite day laborers cal hires them
some kind of construction is going on back there
cals cell phone rings
we go with jacob on his
hes waiting outside a liquor store in his car
i know ive been out of circulation
you abandoned me at my time of need
ive been a little
things have gotten a bit
i met a woman
i bet you did
no i mean ive been spending a lot of time with her

yes i realize that asshole
hannah comes out of the wine store hops over the car
jacob cant help but smile wow hes really into her
grab a beer next week
youve got my number
good for you by the way
cal hangs up laughs to himself and gets back to work
tracy pulls up to her house
as she pulls in she notices robbie
hes standing outside the front door in a tuxedo
a shit eating grin on his face
she sighs what now
and parks the car
claire is putting away laundry
she throws some underwear in jessicas bottom drawer
its addressed to cal weaver
curiosity piqued she picks it up
big bernie sits in a recliner watching football and drinking a cold one
jessica lies on the floor doing homework
claire enters ashen
zombie like she hands bernie the envelope
jessica looks up sees it
she jumps but its too late
staring at the picture
we dont see it but we get the point its a fathers worst nightmare
bernie dazed slides the pictures back into the envelope
he looks at the envelope again
bernie puts a hand up
he cant speak
he marches out the door
from inside we hear a car screech away
she grabs a second set of keys
jessica runs into a second car
races after her father
tracy approaches robbie
not only is he wearing a tuxedo hes carrying a bunch of scarves
what are you wearing
tracys face drops
i have to blindfold you
what is this
what is he doing
hes your husband not al queda
youll make it out alive
she cant help but smile
she kneels down allowing robbie to blindfold her from behind
he ties a scarf around her eyes
then another at a different angle double knots it
okay were good lets do this
theres no expression on bernies face
he looks down at passenger seat
at the envelope bearing cals address
he races through a light
a horn blares behind him
jessica is the one blaring the horn crying and panicked
she too races through the same light
robbie leads a blindfolded tracy into the backyard
she looks like a zombie with all the scarves over her face
we see what she is not yet privy to
cals shangri la has been transformed the yard holds a full blown miniature golf hole windmill and all
cal stands behind it all in a tux
can i take these off please
robbie cues music which will play throughout this scene
molly in a party dress carries a glass of champagne to tracy and puts it in her hand
twenty five years ago cal weaver saw tracy boyle for the first time walking the halls of woodside middle school cal are you seriously doing this in front of the
if it goes bad im supposed to take molly upstairs and put the tv on loud
tracy sighs giving up
well might as well wait for your daughter
shes right next to you t

and right behind her
holding a bottle of wine and smiling like an idiot

then looking up bernie
a body flies into cal and knocks him out of frame
jessica runs after her father screaming daddy no
is that jessica
bernie lands a solid right into cals jaw
bernie is pummeling cal
jacob dives in
tries to pull bernie off
bernie nails jacob with an uppercut
bernie i dont know what youre bernie picks up a windmill from the miniature golf course readies to bash it over cals head
jessica throws herself on cal
this breaks bernies trance
he didnt do anything
he doesnt even know
robbie please get this off me

he doesnt even know that im in love with him
robbie stops turns
pointing at cal with him
are you pointing at me

who is she pointing at
wait my dad is the older guy youve been seeing
i knew it
he gets ready to pummel some more
jessica grabs him
he doesnt even know about the dirty pictures i made for him
you made him dirty pictures
robbie looks to cal
hes angry jealous and broken hearted all at once
youre the one
youre the one she
then furious you stole my soulmate
wait jessica is your soulmate
im sorry is tracy home
everyone turns david jacobowitz stands in the doorway
hes holding up a sweater in his right hand
you left your sweater in my car the other night
who are you
is this a bad time whack
jacob levels david jacobowitz with a right hook
you know how much misery youve put this poor bastard through
before jacob can finish cal levels jacob
stay the hell away from my daughter
jacob jumps on cal
david jumps on jacob
bernie tries to pull them apart
jessica finally gets the blindfold off tracy
the women and children watch the battle in horror
cal jacob bernie and david jacobowitz sit side by side on the miniature golf hole bloodied but still
reveal two police officers standing in the center of the yard
one of them finishes writing in a pad
that should about do it
to his partner what do you think
the other cop shrugs
the first cop thinks then look im just gonna write domestic disturbance reported but all clear okay
cause honestly i dont even know what to put down here
thank you officer
he nods walks to the door
simmer down okay
we all have arguments but if youre gonna fight just do it inside
keep it in the family okay
jacob snarfs down a laugh
cal glares at him
ill kill you
the cops look at cal at each other shrug and exit
our whole cast is there disheveled and bloodied
the place looks like a hurricane has hit
a miniature golf hole torn to shreds
bernie turns to jessica
looks back at cal
im so sorry and thats that
robbie runs to the driveway looks as jessica runs after her father trying to apologize
but he wont even look at her
they get in their respective cars drive off
jacob approaches cal
cal turns to hannah
this man is a lowlife and a under her breath oh thats ironic
cal whips around
im sorry what
tracy doesnt push it
cal turns back to hannah
you may not be able to see it but i have
over and over again
you are not to see him any more
dad cmon im not going to stop seeing him
cal turns away
well then i dont have anything else to say to you
cal stop being unreasona i said get the hell out of my this time its tracy whose face registers shock
hannah takes jacobs hand pulls him away
one last try cal cmon but cal wont even look at him
cal lets them go then grabs his things
shes all yours david
before he goes cal stops in front of robbie
go big or go home right buddy
robbie looks up at him cold
go home dad
cal nods exits
cue john mayers who says
robbie at school
his spirit is crushed
he looks at his contact list thinks and deletes jessica
at home grounded and sad
trying to get hannah to make a phone call to her father
at her office finally taking down the picture of her and cal
and speaking of cal
cal sits back at his usual table
this isnt cool cal the jacob disciple
no this is sad mess cal
hes grown a patchy beard
hes wearing a ratty sweatsuit
hes drinking once again vodka cranberry out of a wimpy red straw
a waitress approaches
can i get you another
what time is it
in the afternoon
would have been sufficient but i appreciate the judgment cocktail waitress
yes another drink would be grand
cal feels bad for that one
as she re approaches that was uncalled for
sorry for being a dick
ah its okay i deserved it
as always he looks perfectly put together
he takes in cal
its a nice sweatsuit cal
what do you want
can i sit
i dont know can you
okay are we going to be mature about this or act like children
are we going to be mature or act like children
okay so like children then
jacob slides in
id like to talk
you still seeing my daughter
then i have nothing to say to you
cal look at me
jacob still has that power over him
you been hanging out here a lot
must be missing a lot of work
i have a lot of vacation days
i hate the beach
youve got a lot of nerve coming here just then the waitress re approaches
delivers cals drink
they wait her out
you want a sip
no she probably spit in it
jacob nods as cal pushes the drink away
your kids miss you
youre hanging out with my kids fantastic
you can teach robbie how to objectify women hell love that
his eighth grade graduation is next week
of course im coming
well you havent exactly been around for him cal
hes not my biggest fan right now
oh thats a good excuse alright man whore if your lecture on parental responsibility is almost done i love her cal
cal looks up
ive never been in love before
honestly ive never even been in like before
i never got it
i saw people in love i saw weakness
i heard them say the things they said and do the things they do it all just seemed so
shes my perfect combination of everything cal
cal looks up at jacob
he smiles gently
i know you
i know what you are
you are not good enough for my daughter
and you will never have my permission nor my approval
ill see you at graduation
once more cal is alone
just as he wants it
a small middle school amphitheater
about people fill the crowd of an intimate middle school graduation
tracy molly and hannah sit in the front row
jessica sits with her family a few rows away
all look nice
sits cal sandwiched between random spectators
cal is now shaven and well dressed but he looks miserable
his eyes brighten for a moment as he notices
an empty seat between tracy and hannah
he leans forward are they saving it for him
but just then
kisses hannah and takes cals seat
cal looks nauseous
we watch the ceremony for a moment
the principal labors through her introduction
and now to introduce the first student speaker our very own english teacher kate thompson
cals former conquest steps onto stage
tracy looks away clearly uncomfortable at the teachers presence
she accidentally catches cals eye
our next speaker is not only the class salutatorian but hes also one of the most
young men ive ever had the pleasure of teaching
ladies and gentlemen robbie weaver
robbie takes the stage to applause
this is not the same kid weve come to love
theres something different in his face
hes been broken
he spots jessica
a bit monotone thank you mrs
welcome class of
i wasnt really sure what i wanted to talk about today
thompson said it might be good to talk about growing up and getting older and stuff
so i guess ill talk about that
cal watches concerned
wheres his son
i grew up a lot this year i think
i used to think that growing up meant really growing
like getting taller and bigger
but now i think that growing up just makes you smaller
your dreams get smaller and what you want gets smaller
beat then i grew an inch and a half this year but i feel a lot smaller
cal sits forward getting increasingly concerned
i was in love
and i know that makes parents laugh because im only thirteen but whatever i was
i believed that there was one true love for everyone and if you fought for that person your one true love would always work out
but thats not how it works
it sounded good when i was younger but
its just not how it works
theres no such thing as one true love for everyo stop
cal is standing in the middle of the crowd
everyone turns to look at him
awkward to crowd hi everyone
no one knows what to do
cal is suddenly really uncomfortable
may i have a word with my son
itll just take a second
cal tries to extricate himself from his row
he steps over people squeezes by people almost trips
finally clear he gathers himself and tries to keep his dignity as he marches down the aisle past his family
robbie comes to the front of the stage bends down
what are you doing
i dont know
what are you doing
robbies eyes well up with tears
i was wrong dad
theres no such thing as cal turns toward the crowd announces
my sons graduation speech sucks
gasps from the crowd
now standing alone front and center in front of an entire eighth grade graduation ceremony
he looks behind him at the panel of teachers
thompson discreetly gives cal the finger
in fairness i dont know where he was going but i think we can all agree it was heading in a pretty depressing direction
and i basically wrote it for him
i mean i didnt literally write it but i sure as hell influenced it and the kids already a spitting image of his mother and ill be damned if this
is what hes going to get from me
people squirm uncomfortable
this is a train wreck
my son not him my actual son he believes in grand romantic gestures
he believes that people have soulmates
and we always want to tell our thirteen year olds that theyre wrong that one day youll understand young man
but maybe it should be the other way around
he looks at tracy out in the crowd
i met my soulmate when i was fifteen years old
our first date we went for ice cream
after my dad started teasing me about my first date the way dads do
and i told him stop making a big deal dad
im going to go on lots of dates with plenty of girls
that was the first time i ever lied to my father
i met my soulmate when i was fifteen years old
and i have loved her with everything i have for every minute of every day ever since she let me buy her that first mint chip ice cream
i have loved her through the birth of our three perfect children and i have loved her even as ive hated her only married couples can truly understand that one
and i dont know what will wind up happening with us i dont robbie im sorry i cant give you that but i promise you this i will never stop
when you find the one you never give up trying
and i love you my amazing boy for reminding me of that
robbie hugs his father as the crowd reacts
cal kisses his son on the head then motions towards the microphone
robbie grabs it with newfound gusto and announces i still love you jessica
ive loved you since the first time you changed my sisters diaper
ive loved you since
the crowd reacts laughs cheers etc
as robbie continues
cal stands back and smiles
his boy is back
the ceremony is over
robbie heads over to his family
they hug him kiss him
cal approaches hannah and jacob
he smiles at her adoring
my perfect girl
he kisses her forehead turns to jacob
i already ordered a gun
im not kidding
i ordered a colt
on a shady internet site i can show you the receipt
if you hurt her i am prepared to shoot you in the face
cal im not going to shut up jacob
jacob shuts up
i like that
jacob smiles shakes hands with cal
cal notices is that a new shirt
hannah took me to the gap
its actually not as bad as i thought
of course not cal
its the gap
i got this at nordstroms
and like that
order is restored in the universe
who approaches jessica
it was nice of you to come
i wouldnt have missed it
so how are things with your dad
i took a summer internship up at stanford gonna head up there early
figure it cant hurt to get out of his line of sight for a while
yeah probably a good idea
you were a good baby sitter jessica
im sorry if i made you uncomfortable
he holds out his hand to shake formally
wait i thought you werent giving up
but i figure you like my dad and one day ill look like my dad so ill just come for you then
its a good plan
she looks over her shoulder reaches into her purse
until then a little graduation gift
to help get you through high school
she hands him something in an envelope the same type of envelope she once used for
robbie peeks inside
his eyes bug out
jessica kisses him sweetly on the cheek
you take care robbie
robbie watches her go
love struck once more
cal steps up next to his son
you okay buddy
i am now dad
i am now
robbie runs off to join his friends
im terrified of whats going to become of him once he hits puberty
cal turns tracy has been watching
we might have to lock him up
cal walks over toward her
you gave a good eighth grade graduation speech
ive been working on it for thirty years so
she laughs then
do you think we can ever come back from all this cal
i dont know
id like to try though
i know id like to try
she nods thinking
things are just so messed up
and its been such a strange year
ive been in such a strange place
and we have all these problems so many problems ive lost count but at the end of the day i mean the only thing i know she stops herself emotional
then simply i am just so glad you took me for that ice cream
they share the moment in silence
it was rocky road by the way
as they joke and argue about what flavor the ice cream was we pull back
off to the side robbie steps away from his friends and watches them enjoy one anothers company
