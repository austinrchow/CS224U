written by michael tolkin anthony minghella final script november the flicker of film
footage from a press conference
you kill your film several times mostly by talking about it
a film is a dream
you kill it writing it down you kill it with a camera the film might come to life for a moment or two when your actors breathe life back into
it but then it dies again buried in film cans
mysteriously sometimes in the editing room a miracle happens when you place one image next to another so that when finally an audience sits in the dark if youre lucky
very lucky and sometimes ive been lucky the dream flickers back to life again
thats why im secretive
so whats your favorite pasta
finally a serious question
a word a huge soundstage
the studio superintendent lets a man into the stage turns on a working light
supertitle cinecitta film studios rome good luck maestro
departing he closes the soundstage door
as the man crosses the shadowy stage a dim shaft of light catches his face weary handsome haggard
guido contini the most famous film director in the world
in front of him an enormous dusty multi level film set under construction
a complex maze of scaffolding its unfinished chaotic elements suggesting ancient ruins
cracked stone facades broken columns open platforming the skeleton of a grand staircase
a lighting grid not yet hung and a camera crane surrounded by a forest of studio lights on stands
guido sits at the table lights up a cigarette and puts on his glasses
he looks at the plans looks up at the stage puts his glasses down and stands up stepping over to the crane
guido alone cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth contemplates the studio its turbulent set in every sense a jumble of ideas
guido looks at the set in despair
he sits in the bucket seat of the crane buries his head in his hands overwhelmed
maestro maestro maestro contini
how do you begin
how do you begin this thing
in the distance a figure approaches out of the darkness the darkness of guidos imagination
an escape from his tortured reality
the figure emerges gradually like a goddess
she is gorgeous imposing and seductive
she is claudia his film star his muse
when claudia reaches guido she stops in front of him takes his hands from his face and kisses him
and with that gesture the music swells the lighting grid rises majestically into the air the gritty soundstage transforms into something beautiful transforms into the interior world of as claudia
moves away more and more women slowly appear
they emerge from everywhere
these are the women from guidos life past and present
women from his films women he has loved the sources of his inspiration and creative genius
a grand overture unfolds
the most significant women in guidos life are revealed each with their own powerful entrance luisa his wife carla his mistress lilli his costume designer and accomplice guidos mamma her
spirit stephanie a fashion journalist saraghina a whore p
a dark and glamourous dream
the women surround guido and he loses himself and his anxiety in their collective embrace
the fantasy ends abruptly with a violent grating noise as the studios truck doors are yanked open jolting guido who is slumped in the crane seat
harsh daylight penetrates the gloom
he blinks discombobulated as a group of silhouetted figures approach with purpose
one of the figures is a well fed amiable character dante
he is guidos longtime associate and producer
a younger more ascetic figure accompanies him sharp and birdlike
this is fausto an accountant
dante speaks quickly and without obvious punctuation walking guido
ive been looking for you all over the place
the sets coming along
how are you
bene grazie bene
guido stands to greet him
they kiss on both cheeks
my god you look terrible better go to makeup forget youve got a press conference
discreetly to dante he has no tie
yes makeup and wardrobe
he takes guidos arm and they head towards daylight
guido looks back at fausto who follows and with a look and a gesture asks dante who is he
overlapping dante signor contini im fausto
good morning signor contini
interrupts hes counting costs you know
the bank wants him here
to fausto dont speak to him i speak to him
okay i have some questions for signor contini
we all have questions for signor contini
they head outside
guido dante and fausto hurry through the studio en route to the production offices
behind them is a large poster of claudia starring in guidos last movie a failure la donna moderna the modern woman
as guido passes he causes a mild stir and many people nod deferentially offer a maestro or dottore
yes but please please i think its customary for there to be an approved script and budget before filming commences
is he going to follow us
its not my intention to be difficult
maestro i am a huge admirer of maestro continis movies your early films are
everybody loves them and
i consider it a great honour for me to be here now
none the less i need a script and a budget
neither dante nor guido respond
they make their way to the production offices
everywhere signs for the movie italia
a long corridor bustling with activity
the trio heads down it
if a pretty girl goes by and there are several both guido and dante turn to look but without missing a beat of their solemn conversation
as they progress into and through the open plan office many of the crew look up and cluster around trying to get guidos attention swelling the procession interjecting with their
there are set models everywhere in the process of being constructed or painted
jaconelli guidos production designer looks up from a model hurries over
nobody stops moving
as a pretty girl passes between them they all turn to look
pierpaolo guidos young pa has caught up with the procession
he has dozens of phone messages sorting through them as he walks alongside guido through a partitioned office where do you want your messages
on my desk
theres no room on your desk
into the main office under my desk
in the trash
non lo so
waving them at him some of these are urgent
to pierpaolo get me a cigarette
confidentially we will never be ready to shoot in ten days
jaconelli at the same time not ready
continues ascolta me
he kisses jaconelli on the cheek careful what you say
hes a spy from the bank
guido carries on moving through the office
hes not exactly from the bank guido
now benito guidos casting director moves towards guido guido tries to duck away from him as they head towards guidos office
you have actors waiting for you in your office
auditions all morning
you should see what ive found
i found two sisters
look theyre right
guido turns through another partition as they all besiege him with questions
dottore this way
guido heads towards wardrobe goes straight through the door swinging it shut leaving the chaos behind him
dante blocks benito
hes got the press conference
guido comes through the door blows hard from the barrage
theyre in lillis domain here and a haven always for guido
part edith head part coco chanel lilli is guidos costume designer no longer young cranky indomitable sharp as a tack
she adores guido without any sentiment
shes incapable of sentiment
guido heads straight towards her desk where she is cutting some fabric
i need a cigarette
dante comes in closing the door behind him
he needs a shirt and tie lilli
guido sits up on lillis table as dante heads to lillis desk and picks up the phone to make a call
i need a coffee and a cigarette
he lies down
unimpressed answer a question ill give you a coffee
answer another question ill give you a cigarette
and so on
actually and an aspirin
dante stands at lillis desk and looks at some drawings
in the background on the phone were running late
turns to guido and lights a cigarette calm down
directing a movie is a very overrated job we all know it
you just have to say yes or no
what else do you do
maestro should this be red
yes no yes no yes no thats directing
lilli hands guido the lit cigarette
thats right thats directing
and it doesnt seem to make a blind bit of difference finally what the answer is
so please guido yes or no do you want any costumes in this film
you see simple
handing him an espresso fetched by her assistant might i know what period the movies in
lilli glances at dante who has edged closer to the table he looks at the costumes
downs the espresso soon
lilli glares at dante ushering him away
you know i dont allow producers in here
two minutes guido
lilli is the only person who intimidates dante
guido pulls out his own tie from his pocket
lilli walks round and takes the tie off him
guido sits up
lilli puts the tie round his neck
have you written a word of the script
are you in a panic
she ties guidos tie for him
is luisa going with you to the press conference
and his spy
you need to shave
you look terrible
looking around desperate why is there no fire escape in here
what if somebody needed to escape
i cant face these reporters
i have nothing to say
youll be fine
youre a world class liar darling go out there and lie for italy lie for italia
guido is driving his roadster through the streets of rome
an italian pop song of the day is playing on the radio as he speeds around the piazza del poppolo
in front of him in the convoy is dante with fausto
as guido drives he turns to see his mamma in the passenger seat
hes not remotely surprised
she appears the way he remembers her
mamma is extraordinary
what the hells wrong with me
i cant sleep
i cant think
i cant write
i cant breathe
my heart is racing
am i dying mamma
i owe you flowers i know
ill come to the cemetery at the weekend
you should have let me bury you in roma mamma i could visit you every week
dont look at me like that
with kindly patience oh guido guido
he stops at a busy intersection
this is the rome of la dolce vita the rome of vespas skinny ties cool sunglasses impossibly cool young people
a magnificent fall day and the cafes are stuffed with the beautiful and chic
this is your rome guido
the world sees rome the way you invented it
your films did that
buoyed by her encouragement i miss you
i miss you too
guido is in his own world
the policeman raps on the bonnet of the car
guido startles and pulls off alone in the car
guido looks across as he drives
mamma has gone
the convoy comes to a quick stop in front of the hotel excelsior on the via veneto
as soon as guido gets out of the car the waiting paparazzi snap his picture
beautiful women look at him
guido moves quickly by them
dante and the team hurry after him
fausto tackles dante
and they hurry after guido
a big suite
about fifty reporters men and women are in the room and an array of microphones are on a coffee table next to a long couch
a radio reporter narrates in the background
and were just waiting for the arrival of contini
any moment now could this film put the maestro back on top
a few news cameras are filming
theres a buffet and a bartender
and guido comes into the room shaking hands patting shoulders grabbing a glass of champagne
dante and the team follow him in
and here he is
silenzio per favore
thank you thank you
dante guido continis long time producer is about to speak
i want to say a few words from my heart
i am humbled and thrilled to be able to announce that i am producing guido continis next film italia which will star once again continis longtime inspiration the international film
star claudia jenssen
a stunning film poster is revealed claudia jenssen emerging from the colosseum claudia jenssen
un film di guido contini
we start shooting in ten days time in cinecitta
that makes it one week from monday
to guido handing over thank you maestro thank you very much
this is our ninth film together
thanks for coming everybody
pretending to leave he heads towards the exit and kisses dante on the cheek
he returns to the couch
all the reporters fire their questions at once
the questions come on top of each other and guido covers his despair with an inflated energy
he takes his sunglasses off and signals to dinardo a harsh looking woman
maestro contini your new film is called italia
another journalist leopardi vile sitting next to her egging dinardo on almost sniggers with contempt
actually its my shortest title yet
but hardly a modest one
films are not modest
they cost too much they take too long and they involve too many people
so they should have grand titles
and might you tell the press what the film is about
i still dont know what my last film was about
in a loud aside to dinardo that was the problem
nobody else did
of course i can tell you what my film is about
i can tell you the story i can tell you who i am going to cast the music i want to use i can tell you everything
im afraid that if i say anything the word might get out to the press
general laughter in the room
he wins a round but is clearly feeling the strain
dante recognizes steps in
our next film will be exactly as it sounds
its the very spirit of italy italy as myth italy as a woman italy as a dream
is this true
it sounds fantastic
i cant wait to see it
hes still winning
ignoring the question he points to stephanie a gorgeous fashion reporter he recognizes from american vogue
flirtatious and charming she wants him and he senses it
could you tell the fashionable women of america who your favorite designer is this year
im less interested in the wrapping than what might be inside it
youre a man of the world yes
educated in britain a home in biarritz
with italia is it fair to say that youve come home for good
tries to interrupt what do you think of the new wave in the french cinema
its been a long time since you made a movie with your wife do you plan on casting her in this new film
guido is spinning plates
i told luisa that when we got married i would never again make love to my leading lady
but she hasnt worked at all since working with you
everyone starts firing questions at guido again
another reporter asks a question
but why are you being so tight lipped about this film
its a serious question
whats the big deal
we discover guido alone on the soundstage of his unfinished set
a retreat into surreality
he sits on the same couch from the hotel suite
he slouches arms folded legs crossed with his hat pulled over his eyes
you want me to be serious
in a press conference
i thought i was the clown in this circus
artists do their best work before theyre famous
now youre famous
without wishing to be negative but your last two films theyre not they were
im just asking if youre nervous
you seem nervous
this stops guido
he doesnt answer
we see a bead of sweat running down the back of guidos neck
what im asking maestro is have you run out of things to say
as the number progresses guido gets up from his chair and begins to scale the enormous heights of his unfinished set with great effort
i was wondering if you think theres a limit to what you can show in a movie
what would you like to see that i havent already shown you
she smiles he smiles back lighting his cigarette
guido turns to the mantle
he grabs a bottle of whiskey looks up into the large gilded mirror at his reflection
we see two guidos
amidst the chaos guido notices a waiter with a tray of glasses entering the suite through a hidden door in the wall
as the waiter passes guido slyly opens the door and sneaks out
guido continues climbing higher and higher
guido slips through the hallway down the grand lobby staircase and escapes
as guido reaches the pinnacle of his everest like set guidos women appear on the different levels
guido speeds away from rome in his roadster
guidos car passes by the remnants of an ancient aqueduct with women from his fantasy draped around him spilling out of his car
the women sing a musical flourish of praise to guido
now guido and his women are in the countryside
the car races over a hill blurring the countryside and we see the blue mediterranean sea and the pretty spa town of anzio
the alfa spyder comes to a screeching stop in front of the gates of the entrance of an impressive looking spa grand hotel bellavista
the hotel has a slightly faded glamour something that lifts it a little out of time
guidos women are gone as the song ends
supertitle bellavista spa hotel anzio italy guido enters like a thief
he doesnt want to be recognised
he approaches the front desk where an immaculate desk clerk the urbane and wise de rossi waits to greet him
i need a room
with a view of the sea
something with air
all of our suites have air
let me just look for you
ive come from milano
im a businessman
busy busy busy
without looking up would maestro contini prefer to register under a pseudonym
suggesting a name signor milano
continuing to work needless to say i love your films
those early films
not the flops
anxious confidential i need to see a doctor
do you know one whos discreet
id like to see him today in my room now if possible
consider it done
takes the key and i need to place a call
to my wife
guido writes the number on a piece of paper on the desk
you can take the call at the lobby phone over there
guido heads into the elegant art deco booth pulls the glass door shut
the phone rings
he picks up
we intercut between the phone booth and luisa in their apartment in rome
luisa knows every move of guidos
she manages him very well calm dry and funny
there you are
is everybody mad at me
well im mad at you
where are you
i had to escape from the press conference
dont tease me
im sick luisa
youre making a film
you make a film you get sick
its what happens
no but this time im really sick
i cant breathe
are you by yourself
yes of course im by myself
then shall i come
yes please come thats why im calling please come straight away
that would be wonderful
i dont know where you are
i dont know some spa
i just kept driving
well i cant come if i dont know where you are
suddenly claustrophobic and actually its hardly worth it
ill be home in a day or two
all too familiar yes its hardly worth it
but i do wish you were here
get some rest take the waters sleep then come back here and make a good movie
i love you
he hangs up pensive
goes straight back to de rossi at the front desk and scribbles down another number
your doctor is on his way
carefully this number if a woman answers you put it through to my room otherwise
de rossi understands
its a wrong number
close up on guidos eye being held open by a doctor
guido is on the bed shirt open
the doctor examines guidos eye while a heavy set nurse takes his blood pressure
the doctor stands and turns to his case
he walks round to her
the nurse whispers to the doctor
they look at the blood pressure gauge
guido is disturbed by their conspiracy
what is she whispering
is it my blood pressure
is it serious
am i dying
to the nurse not answering guido check again
the doctor interrupting him takes a tongue depressor from his kit
the doctor sits on the bed beside guido and takes his cigarette out of his mouth
he stubs it out
the phone rings
the doctor is in the way of the phone
guido desperately makes an attempt to reach it and cant
hes trapped by the doctor and by the nurse holding his arm
your liver your heart your kidneys theyre all very cross with you signore
guido opens wide gagging as the phone continues ringing
guido looks at the ringing phone but the nurse has his arm in her grip as she takes his blood pressure for the second time
and the phone continues ringing
but youve come to the right place
there are a dozen mineral springs around the town
the roman emperors came here for the waters
guido lunges for the ringing phone with the blood pressure cuff still on his arm and picks it up
it is carla at the perfect wrong time
into the phone pronto
signor contini its the signora
coming back quickly to life its a very an important call doctor
im sorry i have to take it
as you wish
an enormous swathe of pink satin rakes across the scaffolding of guidos unfinished set
emerging from the highest point is a pair of long legs sliding down the lush fabric
she wears stockings heels and little else
bathed in hot light carla reveals herself from inside the sumptuous folds of satin
the nurse still taking his blood pressure and listening to his pulse is concerned about guidos vital signs
to guido is something wrong
its about my film
its from the vatican
go ahead monsignore
yes yes of course im listening
carla slides from the lush fabric onto a mirrored platform
as she sings she writhes and undulates in a seductive display of sexuality
this is guidos ultimate fantasy
guido trying to hide the effects of this phone sex from the doctor and nurse
carla grabs onto two satin covered ropes suspended from the ceiling
she wraps herself in them swinging and gyrating
spoken i love you guido
carla disappears in a cloud of hot steam that becomes the steam from an arriving train
and out of the steam
carla comes walking toward guido swinging her hips with a porter behind her pulling five bags on a wagon
carla is dressed in her own style which is not chic but its what guido likes a little too tight a little flamboyant
she wears it with pride
to himself remembering how much work she is carla
and now to her covering his ambivalence carla
im so happy to see you
she gives him a hug and a kiss both too much for him in public
i missed you so much
they move off are you happy im here
but very happy
or just a little happy
she sees something in his face that worries her
you look very tired very tired
avoiding this looks at her bags carla all those bags for the weekend
yes the bellavista is a very fashionable place
you know i stayed there with my parents during the war it was full of germans
i have to tell you
they found out who i am at the hotel no
yes horrible but obviously we dont want to be followed by the press so i found the most charming pensione for you and its right here
here at the station
a small pensione across the street from the station
carla sizes it up and its really not at all what she was hoping for but she doesnt say anything
later carla in silhouette from behind
wrapped in a sheet she is looking out the window of the dingy room
the light from the pensiones neon sign spills in
close the curtains its too light in here
carla closes the curtains
they continue to whisper
now go into the corridor what
yes count to ten and come back in and pretend youre in the wrong room and im a complete stranger carla sits on the bed facing guido
i love your games
she kisses him
im here on business
what about it
get your makeup
guido switches on the light puts on his glasses and tilts the lamp shade up
he begins to pencil in a beauty mark and darken her eyes
he is meticulous about this and precise and takes his time to make it exactly as he wants it
i had a nightmare last night
we were in that little alley behind piazza navona where i bought you that scarf remember
the same one your wife bought you probably doesnt dont move carla
when you wear it i never know if its hers or mine
not really listening uh huh
so we were there on the ground naked kissing and we didnt care and then my husband arrived and killed us both with a shovel
he would never do that
hes so sweet
he speaks latin
he knows all the roman emperors
still intent on his makeup job good for him
perhaps theres a job for him in the movie why not
you could work well together
when you come in i want you to be my little savage
gesturing towards the door go go
guido takes off his glasses and puts them on the side table
you think i am one of your actresses
hurry please carla
carla gets up and takes guidos glasses with her
guido turns out the light and settles into his pillow for the game
carla looks at herself in the mirror
ill pretend to be asleep
carla turns back to the mirror she puts on guidos glasses and turns back to him
what if i really found the wrong room
would you be jealous
could you do such a thing
carla teases him with a look that says why not
carla goes into the hall and closes the door behind her
we hear the matron who runs the pensione talking to her
while they talk guido removes a crucifix from the wall and puts it in the bedside drawer
now carla comes back into the room giggling signaling for guido to keep quiet
still giggling it was the woman from the hotel
she wanted to give me towels
you are a stranger i dont know you
carla just come here
indicating her sheet be savage
she crosses the room and climbs onto the bed and opens the sheet slowly spreading her arms wide
ive got the wrong room
yes you have
and i dont have the faintest idea who you are
she throws herself on guido whose arms enfold her
carla is asleep her bare back a thing of post coital beauty
guido sits on the edge of the bed quietly getting dressed filled with confusion and guilt
guido tip toes out of carlas room shoes in his hand
he walks down the hallway alone
page one page one page one
the figure emerges from the darkness like a goddess
she is claudia his muse
images of claudia in his fantasy
she takes the mans face and kisses him
guido is surrounded by discarded bits of paper an outline of italia
an empty sheet of paper sits in his typewriter on his desk
he is not working on the outline
he is sketching a voluptuous woman
and with that gesture hes suddenly inspired to write something
he draws in the nipples on the womans breasts
guido becomes discouraged
he tosses off his glasses and runs his hands through his hair in frustration
mother of god give me a sign
hes happily distracted by the sound of vehicles arriving outside his window
he opens a slat in the shutters looks down as a motor calvacade draws up
at its heart is an impressive luxury car
hotel staff swarm around the vehicles which discharge a procession of religious including an ancient cardinal in scarlet robes and the cardinals secretary
priests follow as the cardinal heads inside the hotel
guido is intrigued hurries out of his hotel room
as guido hurries down the stairs the cardinal is being helped into the elevator
the cardinals secretary is dealing with check in formalities with de rossi
guido calls to him
excuse me father
his excellency the cardinal is he
recognising guido signor contini
starstruck i am a big fan
i would very much like to speak to the cardinal
do you think he might grant me is claudia jenssen with you
his excellency is a big admirer of signorina jenssen
explaining im in need of some guidance some pointers
do you think you could find a signed photograph of signorina jenssen
for his excellency
im sure that would be possible
what a pleasure
he heads towards the elevator
guido watches him go then a voice calls out his name
guido cant turn round
he knows that voice
guido hurries towards the elevator
the elevator doors close
guido is trapped
im not going to ask how you found me
please its my job
a producer needs to know where his director is at all times
even to know the pensione where his mistress is staying
i understand guido
rome is absolutely unbearable
its no good
he takes guido by the arm and leads him to a stairwell
of course i understand
youre not going to drag me back
youre a genius and genius must be served
thank you my old friend
dante is guiding him where are we going
you cant be in rome
heading towards the ballroom rome will come to you
dante opens the door of the ballroom to reveal a full casting office
the models costumes headshots everything all in place or being put into place
an absolute beehive of activity
guido is staggered
its a fantastic place for you to focus
everyone is here to help the movie
everyone is here because they love you guido
he stands watching guido with genuine admiration as he sets to work with his team
guido moves through the room avoiding specific questions from everyone
as he does so dante makes his way over to guido with a magnificent girl on his arm
explaining his designs yes with the flower and the glass and the arches of the roman empire
you remember donatella
he doesnt shes new ciao
donatella you tested her
i was very nervous
he probably doesnt remember
i was quite nervous
distracted taking it all in no i remember you
you were we all enjoyed you so to speak
pierpaolo guidos assistant holds a telephone
guido wants to know who it is
then takes the phone
he attacks the phone call with gusto
listens to a stream of invective did she like the script
gestures for pierpaolo to light him a cigarette no no no no impossibile are you telling me she didnt get the script
shouting at pierpaolo pierpaolo
he takes the cigarette with a smile and then without missing a beat starts barking at pierpaolo
claudia didnt get the script
send her another one
send her two
playing along yes im sorry
back to lombardo listens yes yes thats what i say people just dont realise shes an actress as well as a star i know dantes dying to talk to you
he hands the phone to dante whos delighted to see guido back on good directing mode
as dante takes over guido walks away heads towards lilli and her domain
yap yap yap yap yap yap yap
guido leaps over the balcony and lies down on a table
performance mode off
lilli nods to roberta to leave
roberta puts down her work and clears the room quietly leaving them alone
what are we doing here
i brought my swimsuit
lilli is working at a mannequin hand sewing some sequins on a costume
a red feathered boa is draped on the figure
it was luisas birthday yesterday
oh please god
i spoke with her yesterday
she didnt even mention it
give me a cigarette
lilli points to the one in guidos hand
guido sees the costume
its for claudia
for which scene
well i dont know which scene until i ve seen the script but she always likes something like this or you do
looks like the folies bergere
italian women dont wear those things
dont knock the folies bergere
lilli tosses the boa over her shoulder as she continues pinning the costume
it brings back happy memories
thats where i learned my art
all those sequins all those feathers
still working and youre wrong you put claudia in one of these for that nightclub scene in natura morta
why did people love that film
guido picks up a straw hat
puts it on his head playfully
oh guido dont
every time we have to start again
im trying to find it
you wont find it with your head jammed halfway up your ass
she produces one
you were saying my head is jammed up my ass
i dont know
why not dream up something entertaining guido
something with music
god knows we could use a little joie de vivre around here
guido looks into the faded ballroom mirror behind her and sees
lilli draped atop an upright piano the red feathered boa hangs from her shoulders
she places the same straw hat on her head
the soundstage has been transformed into an impressionistic version of the folies bergere of the s with lilli as its french star
a spotlight finds guido watching from the scaffolding of his unfinished set
the din of the theater audience fills the smoky atmosphere
singing and performing in a french accent behind a black scrim ghostly images come to life
apparitions that reveal themselves as exotic showgirls barely covered in beads sequins and feathers
they descend the grand staircase
the showgirls disappear
lilli comes down from the piano and crosses onto the stage
the scrim rises
from every corner more showgirls begin to enter
lilli crosses onto the passerelle and speaks directly to the audience
ah bon soir bon soir bon soir
je suis la vedette des folies bergere
vedette it means star
lilli singles out guests at the lip of the stage let me tell you
last night i looked down at this table in the chairs you are sitting in now and what did i see
and next to him
suddenly she sees young guido in the audience
ahh mon dieu
what are you doing here at the folies bergere
you naughty boy
youre only nine years old
but im glad youve come
would you like to join me on stage
come come come
and she brings him onto the stage
the audience applauds
she addresses him as though he is older guido
theres no room for hopelessness in here is there guido
to the audience we must explain something to our young guido
what do we want
what do we want
what do we want
let us not forget guido mon cher thats our privilege to entertain
the number kicks into full gear with a rousing can can
young guido finds himself swept into lillis intoxicating world
lilli crosses the proscenium
her boa grows and grows until it stretches the length of the stage
lilli wraps her long boa around young guido
he and lilli are lifted onto an art deco swing flanked by two showgirls that rises into the air
he is transported and inspired
we seem to be looking at the set on stage
but suddenly a huge head dips into the shot and its guido contemplating a model of the set
he places a figure on the top of the staircase
he moves round to the front of the model and places another figure on the top of the scaffold tower
he knocks it over
unconvinced he sits down on the sofa
the coffee table is covered in head shots
he finds the one of claudia
guido looks at it
he lies back to write and finds himself in claudias lap
she hands him a lipstick smiles and strokes his hair
he starts to sign to his excellency
then paints his lips and kisses the photo himself
grottos and tunnels are thick with steam
guido follows the cardinals secretary
the cardinal is right this way
the cardinals secretary leads guido to a private area where the cardinal is already soaking in a large tub of hot water
your eminence signor contini is here
the cardinals secretary makes a gesture to guido to get into the tub with the cardinal
guido gets in the water
the cardinal looks hard at guido and then makes his first pronouncement
i like charlie chaplin
what can i do for you
do you believe in god
the cardinals secretary is shocked
signor contini please
no no its an honest question

oh yes very much so
not as much as i would like to be not as much as you would like me to be im sure but certainly yes im trying
i will i will
your eminence i am not happy
im searching for something
i feel a sense of misery of despair and interrupting i saw your films
not the flops the others the good ones
but you think people need to see so much sex
its not necessary
we can all imagine
laughing excuse me my films are what i imagine
then your imagination has no moral training
nonplussed how do you train the imagination
the imagination is gods garden dont let the devil play in it
teach our italian women to be wives not whores dont make us look at filth and debauchery
make us proud to be italian
guidos head disappears under the water
the sound of the cardinals voice trails away
supertitle pesaro italy young guido dressed in his school uniform runs fast across the rough dunes with five boys from the village
the boys head for a graffiti covered defensive wall with barbed wire along the top a leftover from the war
they reach into pockets and extract small change hand it to young guido already the ring leader
they crawl through a small opening in the wall and approach an abandoned bunker
young guido takes a step forward toward the bunker as the other boys fearfully take a step back
not loud enough saraghina
now all the boys join in
sa ra ghina
a shadow moves inside the bunker
now even young guido takes a step back but the boys are taking three steps back
and then she comes out
saraghina is a gritty earthy woman with a powerful voluptuous energy
she has darkened eyes and a beauty mark she is clearly the model for the whore makeup on carla
she looks at the boys
she may be a crazy whore but shes not an animal shes just playing one for the boys and they dont quite understand that shes having her own fun with
she takes a deliberate step
young guido stands his ground
she takes another step and holds out her hand
young guido opens his hand with the coins
she looks at the money
is it enough
but she grabs his wrist and holds it and then takes the coins
she stuffs the money in her ample bosom and heads back to her bunker
she returns dragging an old broken chair places it in front of the boys and sits ready for the show
saraghina scoops up the soft white sand in her hands and pours it over her body
a dark vamp begins
curtains of falling sand fill the soundstage
through the sand we see saraghina seated on the same chair from the beach
she speaks surrounded by other whores in provocative positions on beaten up chairs
so you little italian devils you want to know about love
saraghina will tell you
and if you want to make a woman happy you rely on what you were born with
because it is in your blood
with a smile she pulls her dress off her shoulders
sings she grabs her breasts
she undulates her body
the boys watch and cheer
saraghina gets up on the chair lifts her skirt and begins to move her hips
saraghina drops to the ground and playfully writhes in the sand
the boys are transfixed
she gets up and heads towards the water
the boys follow running
saraghina and the whores brandish tambourines
they begin a slow rhythmic and sensual dance that builds into a wild and raucous tarantella
we furiously intercut between the musical fantasy and the memory of the boys romping on the beach with saraghina across the sand and through the water
the whores dance
the number ends
two priests are running down the beach cassocks flapping
the boys run
young guido tries to run away from the priests
they catch him and carry him away from the beach
off screen a boys choir sings kyrie
the priests drag young guido through the schools chapel past a tortured christ hanging above the ornate altar into the principals office
guidos mother is there with the principal again she appears the way he remembers her
i am ashamed of you guido
but mamma what did i do
bring him here
that savage is the devil
god will punish you for your sins now and forever
the principal produces a cane and starts to whip the boy remorselessly
mamma looks away
young guido cries out as they punish him
and the cry is now in guidos mouth on top of carla in the spasm of sex
he suddenly cant breathe
carla is suddenly aware that hes not in ecstasy
he rolls over recovers slowly
as always immediately wanting to leave after the sex
i cant breathe i cant breathe
guido dont die on me
can you imagine
it would kill him
finding her ridiculous if i die it would kill your husband
guido shrugs the sheet off and sits up slowly
carla kneels up and hugs him kissing his back
no thats not what i meant guidino
where are you going
i have to go to work
carla i cant breathe
guido stands up and picks up his shirt
he puts it on whilst they argue
let me come with you
because its impossible
but why is it impossible
look at your producer
hes married he brings his girlfriend to work and nobody cares
everybody knows about me
why wont you let me near you
for the very same reason you dont want me to die on top of you
its not fair to your husband
its not fair to my wife
see youre playing with me
youre twisting everything
please let me come with you
guido heads towards the door still dressing
ill be here waiting for you with my legs open
disgusted with himself he leaves
glittering lights on the terrace
a view of the sea
a pop band and a dance floor
a slick italian male singer performs quando quando quando
the whole production team is at a working dinner
guido is at the end of the table spilling ideas struggling struggling to make sense of italia lets say there were ten sequences each one set in a different period
but played by the same cast a man and a woman a woman and a man
pours himself a glass of wine something light and hectic like mozart would do it like figaro
to lilli like the circus
claudia is going to be amazing
it sounds like a masterpiece
hissing at dante dante you see he hasnt written a word
defending his director the screenplay is first of all a map
thats a map
lets try to dig for something else
maybe a group of people digging with shovels in the desert
she nudges him
he looks across the restaurant to see his wife at the entrance looking for him
he jumps up from the table and hurries towards the dance floor genuinely happy
as guido is protective of luisa
holding her back from the dinner table
i cant believe you came
the jungle drums said it was an emergency
the jungle drums exaggerated just a tiny bit
with concern you havent been sleeping
i was dying until just now
he pulls her into the middle of the dance floor
they start to dance
and dont think i forgot your birthday
when you get home the house will be full of flowers
am i already going home
i hope not
happy birthday my darling
they move together enjoying each other
she kisses him
they walk towards the table
seeing luisa here she is
you know donatella
i do now
she leans across to kiss lilli
he sits luisa down goes to grab a bottle of champagne
to lilli thank you for calling
confidentially youre saving the movie
give him a good idea for gods sake
luisa says hello to the rest of the gang there are kisses etc
as guido returns and pops open the bottle of champagne
lets drink a toast to luisas birthday
negating it it was monday
not quite able to forgive him thank you
just then the cardinals secretary appears
heads towards the table
standing up to greet him then turning to luisa ah don mario
excuse me darling this is don mario
this is my wife luisa
a pleasure signora
sit down wont you don mario
i was telling your husband how much i admire his movies
publicly you know the church condemns them we have to but we all love them
to guido last year we did our own version of your il vicolo at the christmas party
that i would pay to see
luisa was in that film
she was the best thing in the movie
it was your first part
youre luisa acari
oh my lord
you cant stop being somebody
well theres a good catholic wife for you guido thats what they do sacrifice
still signora contini it must be a very exciting life for you
luisa looks to guido
close up on guido
the restaurant table as well as the production team are transplanted onto guidos unfinished set
they are surrounded by camera equipment standing lighting units etc
luisa rises from her chair distancing herself from the scene
the other characters with the exception of guido freeze in a dimly lit macabre tableau
luisa contemplates her life with guido
as the number progresses the world around luisa disappears into a black void leaving only herself with guido in the shadows
luisa climbs the staircase
luisas screen test for guido
a work print in scratched black and white
the music continues
signorina acari per favore
provino numero uno
the clapper board
title il vicolo the alley her name luisa acari
a small set
a couple of tables and chairs as if its an outdoor cafe in piazza navona
luisa enters younger shes like audrey hepburn
luisa sits on the chair
your name its italian
my fathers italian
my mothers french
what have you done before
eyes twinkling oh ive waited
they both laugh and of course i studied theatre and mime in paris
but mostly waited tables
hes fascinated by her
shes taken aback that hes in front of the camera and approaching her
he walks straight up to her and unties her hair
its oddly intimate
he stands back to reappraise her
for what im looking at
walking away keep running
luisa is now at the top of the staircase
she looks at guido from a greater distance and descends the stairs
in reality luisa sees carla enter the restaurant
they look at each other
carla tries to change direction or look as if shes come to the wrong place
luisa gets up abruptly
excuse me i suddenly feel very tired
she hurries away
guido senses something terrible is happening
he gets up and goes after his wife
guido catches up to luisa as she storms up the steps
im staggered by my own stupidity
i could vomit
luisa will you please just tell me what happened
you open your mouth and a lie comes out
why am i surprised
its like breathing to you
she walks away up the steps
guido can only guess at whats happened
he heads back to the terrace restaurant
guido comes back inside
carla is seated at a table
she sees him and calls for him
raging he grabs her and frogmarches her out the door
guido pulls carla through the lobby
trying to explain i was hungry
im tired of eating alone in that room
there are plenty of restaurants
i wanted to see the hotel
i told you i came here with my parents when i was little
i didnt come to disturb you
well you certainly managed to
why didnt you tell me luisa was going to be here
i didnt know she was here
she just turned up
well she could have warned you
the only privilege my wife has these days is not having to warn me
he walks over to the front desk to the ubiquitous de rossi
a taxi please for the signora
guido goes back to the suddenly vulnerable carla
carla you have to wait outside
will you wait with me
im in the middle of a working dinner with my colleagues
so why do i have to wait outside
shamed ill find someone to escort you home
carla walks towards the door conscious of de rossi
de rossi comes out from behind his desk approaches her
carefully signora would you rather wait inside
im going to walk
please tell my friend i had to leave
she walks away
carla walks along the road in the dark stumbling along
the two single beds
luisa is apparently asleep in hers
guido sits on his bed
apparently shes staying in some grotesque pensione next to the station
luisa doesnt move
luisa if id invited her here she would be staying in the hotel wouldnt she
think about it
i didnt even know you were coming
without opening her eyes very plausible
because its true
luisa turns on her bedside lamp and sits up in bed
you told me it was finished
look she was worried about me she came to see if i was all right which yes is stupid but not as far as i know a crime and hardly
a mortal sin
luisa suddenly laughs disconcertingly
smiles insecure what
what are you laughing about
if you could see yourself
raising herself up further i couldnt live with it the absurdity of being you the effort of having to hide and lie and cheat
its exhausting no wonder youve got no script youre too busy inventing your own life
and he is exhausted if it wasnt before it is now
lying back on her bed blah blah blah blah blah
luisa turns over reaches to the bedside lamp and turns it off
guido gets up and hurries from the room
guido enters the bar goes up to the bartender
a voice comes from behind him
ill have one of those
guido looks around its the vogue journalist from the press conference
stephanie grins at him infectious full of flirt
hi guido contini
stephanie from vogue remember me
yes i remember very well stephanina from vogue
you being here
and me being here
taking his glasses off amazing
may i take a cigarette
that was quite a performance
at the press conference
the vanishing act
guido takes a cigarette
the drinks appear
guido produces some money
no please my treat
eyeing guido ive seen all your movies
lights their cigarettes really
like a million times
theyre the only movies that tell the truth about the modern world
and what truth is that
thinks death of religion
i dont think religion is dead
and what exactly is the sexual revolution
that we can talk about later
stephanie crosses her legs
guido looks down and sees her grey patent leather boot moving in time to the beat
you have such style
i always think that
thats the other thing i love about your movies
every frame is like a postcard
its great you care as much about the suit as the man wearing it
its the italian man in you pays for your drinks undresses you with his eyes
i hate that man
style is the new content
its what my readers love
they want to dress like claudia jenssen
they want to undress like claudia jenssen
they want to ride on a vespa down the via veneto
they want to live in an italian movie
the tiered levels of the unfinished set are covered with go go girls in silver miniskirts
at the center of the stage italian male models in stylish suits and ray bans strut down a fashion runway
stephanie makes her entrance on the catwalk
guido lights stephanies cigarette
guido and stephanie share a laugh as she steals a sip from guidos glass
stephanie leads the men in a series of tight rhythmic moves
stephanie rubs her leg against guidos
stephanie whispers into guidos ear as she drops her room key into his pocket
he watches her hips swing as she walks out
guido plays with her room key deciding whether or not to follow
a long line of chic women replace the men on the runway joining stephanie
the number heats up
guido exits the elevator weary and ripe with self disgust and walks down the hallway to stephanies door
guido pushes open the door and drops her key in a bowl
he walks tentatively into the room and sits on her bed
the dressing room door is deliberately ajar
guido catches a glimpse of stephanie undressing in a mirror
suddenly guido is sharing the runway with stephanie the go go dancers and the male models soaking up the adoration as his idol worshipping audience cheers and paparazzi flash
its a party
everyone is chanting guidos name
guido and stephanie exit the runway arm and arm
guido feels consumed with self loathing
he gets up from the bed and bolts from the room
guido enters his own suite
he sits down on luisas bed curls round her and kisses her neck
determined to commit to luisa
i love you luisa
after a moment she turns to him her own hand seeks his
can we please try to be close again
the phone rings shockingly loud
he kisses luisa then grabs the phone to silence it
guido arrives at the pensione
the matron is waiting at the door
as they walk down the hall is the doctor still with her
the matron nods
yes hes in there
hes waiting for you
guido goes in with the matron to find her daughter pressing a cold compress onto carlas head as she lies feverish in the bed
doctor rondi is packing up his things
distant you came
taking her hand im here
doctor rondi is brisk
he nods to guido that they go outside
as guido makes to leave come back
guido reassures her with a gesture
guido and doctor rondi come out
guido is concerned
doctor rondi writes out a prescription as he talks
she took five or six pills enough to make herself very sick
i understand shes your mistress
guido cant answer this is a sordid business
you movie people i suppose you dont consider yourself bound by morality
guido doesnt fight
rondi hands him the prescription picks up his bag turns and walks away leaving guido leaning against the wall
young guido alone and dressed in his school uniform runs fast across the rough dunes
where are you running to
the door knob turns
guido comes back into the room indicates to the matron and her daughter that they should leave
im going to stay with her now
if you need us for anything just call okay
he sits on the side of the bed and puts his hand over hers
carla i should call your husband
no hell take me home
what have you done to yourself
im not worth dying for carla
dont be angry with me
everything i do i just want you to love me
this comes out with enormous tenderness as if she suddenly understands herself
when youre not here with me im still here
when youre in your life making your movies dancing with your wife im still here
guido hears her
knows what shes saying is true
she looks at him
you should rest
well talk about everything in the morning
he stands and pulls a sheet up over her
clutching at him dont leave me
dont leave me
guido lies down next to her she turns to face him
caro caro mio
young guido is scaling the unfinished set as mamma circles him from below
hundreds of candles fill the darkness
mamma intercepts young guido as he jumps down from the spiral staircase and she swings him into her arms
she sings playfully
guido attempts to comfort carla
my husband thinks im clever thats the strange thing because im not well you know that i spend too much time in my little brain thinking about you about where
you are what you are doing what you dream of
mamma guides young guido through an allee of candles
she gently spins young guido and as he completes the turn he is replaced by older guido
mamma now waltzes with her adult son
mamma caresses guidos face
guido pulls away
older guido watches as mamma takes young guido up the grand staircase
mamma sits on the steps with young guido
he rests his head in her lap
older guido walks past them up the staircase
hold on to me mamma
dont let me wake from this
he disappears into darkness
carla looks very fragile as the first rays of sun touch the room
he rubs his face hears voices
he gets up goes out to investigate
carlas husband luigi is talking with matron on the landing
guido straightens himself up approaches as matron retreats to leave them alone
luigi is a nice dignified man
hes very anxious
he and guido cant really look at each other
is she okay
id like to take her home
hapless she loves you you know that dont you
shes my wife
he walks into the room
guido stands outside for a second then turns to go
the door is open as guido enters
hes confused worried that luisa has gone perhaps
but then he sees a figure moving about in the dressing room emptying a closet
dante appears stuffing guidos things into a suitcase
were going back to rome
anxious wheres luisa
shes had it with you
different tone and quite frankly so have i
you drag a whole crew up here and then you just disappear
i cant protect you anymore
and claudia is in rome
makeup tests start today
sits i cant
dont sit down
i need help
still packing youve had help
youve seen the doctors youve seen the priests youve taken the cure
im not cured
decisive no arguments thats enough
the movie calls your star has landed
fausto take his things please
dante walks over to the door with the suitcase passing fausto
a bellboy and a luggage cart stand in the hall
impatient at the door guido
guidos roadster approaches the gates
there are paparazzi gathered for the arrival of claudia for the beginning of filming
they drive through solemn faced ignoring the press
i need more time
forget the script
claudias here now
shell inspire you to do what you do best write with your camera
the whole energy of this return to cinecitta is hectic people wanting to work equipment waiting to work everybody and everything needing guidos attention
guido drives towards the stages
guido feels the pressure that the whole studio is gearing up for a movie that doesnt exist
guido is trying not to panic
he feels as if hes just arrived in prison camp
he drives fast and straight to stage and as they head towards the studio they are immediately swamped
pierpaolo has a hundred requests for guido
maestro the screen tests are back from the lab
will you watch them now
well watch everything tonight and make some decisions
dante marches guido towards the stage
lilli joins them
claudia says where are you
shes in fine form
knows what that means okay
she asked if she could read my script as she didnt have one
i said i didnt quite have mine
lilli peels off and joins her assistant roberta at a rack of costumes
a couple of huge cameras are being prepared some lights are being flown up into the grid the loader is preparing the clapper board
the loader has created a slate italia claudia jenssen hair and makeup tests
the gang enters
guido says a brisk hello to the crew then leaves the set quickly
finds the studio telephone behind the flats
luisa picks up the phone
luisa its me
please dont hang up
she doesnt respond i want you to be with me in the screening room tonight
i want to talk to you about the casting about the script
intercut luisa at home listening inscrutable
otherwise i wont be able to start i wont know what im thinking
pierpaolo appears again always the same needs him to start
guido nods waves him away
are you there
im not asking you to let me come home i just want you to come to the screen test tonight
not for me but for the movie
you always have you always do
luisa puts down the phone
guido is in a mess
guido walks forward and sits by the camera as suddenly theres a commotion at the studio door and lilli and some of her assistants come through silhouettes only followed by
a tall figure who demands the space around her
as the others walk towards a holding area with costumes and wigs and all manner of items the woman who is claudia of course simply walks into the light her
home and stands there waiting for guido
she looks stunning and glamorous
the epitome of a sixties movie star
guido gets up and approaches claudia
pierpaolo acts as first assistant director
and we are rolling
guido gets behind the camera and films claudias test
could you turn to the right please claudia
yes i can turn to my right
and can you turn to the left
yes i can turn to my left
now just one slow turn for us
she turns around okay one slow turn
weve got it
next costume please
makeup artists and costume assistants immediately surround her loosening her hair
dante is thrilled
fausto is also mesmerised
shes a star thats the long and short of it
and shes warming up for a fight with her director
another litany of jibes half joking but dangerous
has anybody got a script
script missing handsome reward
lost one script title italia
cant make a film without it
lilli comes forward puts a chinchilla fur coat on claudia adjusts her hair
so interesting to do hair and makeup for a part when you dont know what the part is
guido adores her her spirit her feistiness
shrugs off the coat no
im going back to my hotel now
anxious but please just a couple more costumes claudia
to guido im going back to my hotel now my darling and when i there is a script ill read it and then well take it from there
calls over to lilli i love the costumes lilli
they are beautiful
back to the guys sweetly ciao bello
to dante thats fair
ill be back
guido races after claudia taking the chinchilla coat from lilli with him
opportunity for escape
calling to guido youve got dailies guido
ill be right back
shouting youve got meetings
guido drives claudia towards the gates which swing open
the paparazzi are in waiting and swarm the car flashbulbs popping men clambering onto the car for a picture of the star driving away with her director
lots of shouting and pleas lots of remonstration from guido
they drive away and are immediately followed by a posse of photographers on their mopeds and vespas and little cars
guidos roadster roars away the papparazzi posse following
guido glances at claudia loves having her in the car shes such a class act
hes always inspired
hes driving fast but distracted by her
you look ravishing
youre not seeing me youre seeing lillis wigs and makeup im somewhere hidden underneath
guidos a good driver and weaves in and out of the traffic
so do the posse but as the road opens up they cant keep up with him and he manages to overtake a car they speed after him
guido stops the car by some narrow streets in the trastevere just south of the vatican
they watch the photographers hurtle past in search of them
they sit for a second
its good to see you
im assuming thats code for theres no script
guido is exasperated
why is everybody so suddenly obsessed with the script
shes always seduced by the way he speaks his passion
they fall in love with each other in every movie thats the way of it
guido lights a cigarette
talk to the people who love you in our films theyre not interested in my script
theyre interested in the way you turn your head the way the camera looks past you to the moon
the way you smile a little as you cry the way you really do blush for the camera how
enough examples sighs who even knows but whatever else it is its not my script
guido has no confidence in what hes saying anymore
they get out of the car and begin to walk away
its almost deserted here
so lilli says im playing a million different parts not a million youre the muses the incredible women who made italy what it is today a country run by men
who are themselves run by women whether they know it or not
teasing him so im the women behind the great men
trying hard to tell the truth the great women
in a way yes you have this man in the story and hes he wants to take hold of everything to devour everything he cant let anything go or he
doesnt want to and he changes direction every day because hes lost hes dying hes bleeding to death
deflating and these muses they fall in love with the man
they fall in love with him
decisive id rather be the man
id rather be the man
she grabs his hat puts it on her head
saunters down the road
these women who come off their pedestals for a kiss theyre just fantasies
no you misunderstand
shes his inspiration
i cant keep playing that part
i fall in love with you every time
when theres a camera between us
its not a real person guido
pointed and this man you describe he doesnt know how to love
claudia heads towards a little piazza with an ancient fountain in the centre of the square
the piazza is empty except for a few cars parked where the entrances have been blocked off
claudia steps up onto the fountain
there was a time once we were on location some terrible hotel and you were in the room directly above me and i could hear you walking about
guido sits down at the edge of the fountain
and all through the night i wanted to rush up the stairs and hammer on your door until you opened
and why didnt you
i dont know
i dont know
claudia leaves behind the hat on the fountain and moves closer to guido
the music continues
maybe you should have knocked maybe you should have knocked me right off the pedestal
i cant do this anymore
she takes off her wig and diamond earrings
this is me
and you have a wife who loves you
she hands him the wig and the earrings
she kisses him
ill miss you
the music ends
claudia turns and walks away
a screen the leader of a film reel numbers counting down the synch pop on and claudia appears on the screen looking extraordinary from the hair and makeup test
people start to comment all enthusiastically
guido gets a cigarette off pierpaolo and lights up
to lilli great work lilli
and the hair makeup fantastic
guido watches sitting alone he turns around as he sees someone come in the door but its gianluca not luisa
she has a beautiful profile
two great profiles
shes a goddess
and the back isnt too bad
she came directly from venus
lets see the actresses
the reel finishes
the lights come up to excited chatter he looks at lilli a row or two behind him she shrugs sympathetically
the room goes dark the next reel begins
guido turns back to look at the screen
during the reel dante is very decisive
shouts out as the women appear
they come on one after the other say their names
guido gives them things to do
pick up the phone and argue with your lover
no make him laugh
make him want you
walk towards the camera as if you were frightened
as if you were angry
on eleanora very angry on the phone if we like her we have to call her agent right away
everybody wants her right now
well they can keep her
shes a very funny actress
you dont like her guido
next actress ilaria
someone comes in the door
guido turns and sees its luisa sitting next to lilli
he turns back to the screen
another actress appears
she says her name
guido instructs her
she tries the phone the walks
shes not a natural
luisa finds the gentle humor in this situation
she looks at guido
a little smile
he feels it like sunshine
he turns back to the screen
shes very natural
shes a bit nervous here
what do you say guido
another girl alessia
keeps looking out past the camera getting sotto voce instructions from guido
her hair is in a chignon
she begins her improv but guido interrupts her suddenly appears in front of the camera
approaches her and undoes the chignon freeing her hair
shes beautiful and innocent
guido says something to her a whisper
but what he says and how he says it the smile it provokes goes like a dagger to luisa
i thought we were looking for a blonde
shes too tall
shes very beautiful
its not the point
guido wants the blonde
shes not bad but shh
shes too beautiful
for my tastes
as the reel finishes
and the lights come up
i dont know what guido thinks
i think we are happy with donatella
donatellas better isnt she
delighted jumps up great
anyway fantastic day but we have to go home
we have a very very busy day tomorrow
thank you very much everybody
okay well done
the screening room empties a lot of mutual congratulations on good work especially to lilli and a hug or a handshake from almost everybody for luisa
lilli kisses her leaves
just the two of them now husband and wife several rows apart in the empty screening room
it meant so much to us all
that you came
nothing from luisa what did you think
did you like anybody or
a gloved hand emerges from behind a beaded curtain beckoning
the curtain opens revealing the silhouette of a figure bathed in red light
guido sits in an audience of raucous men who have filled all the seats around him
they start to whistle as if they were at some sleazy club
guido squirms trapped
the figure steps forward
its luisa tricked out like a seedy nightclub stripper
encouraged what for
thank you for reminding me im not special
you dont even see what you do do you
even the moments i think are ours its just you working to get what you want
dawning on him what are you talking about
he stands up leans on the chair back
the screen test
you have to understand its nothing this is what i do i direct
thats my job
guido stands up straight
and this is our life
you think to create is to forgive yourself in public
but dont think i can forgive you in private because i cant ever
as the strip becomes more raw luisa defiantly exposes her body and her contempt for guido
guido watches humiliated
luisa charges into the audience she is mauled and assaulted by the men
youre just an appetite and if you stopped being greedy youd die
you take everything and im empty
luisa gets up from her chair heads to the exit door
you know im glad i came
i can see now
guido is left alone
the room goes dark as the screen tests on a loop start up again
guido walks into the flickering light of the projector
what have i done
what have i done luisa
he sits silhouetted by the harsh white beams
guido stands and walks towards the image on the screen
he violently rips the screen to the ground
guido collapses to his knees
honest i destroyed everything mamma
suddenly his mother appears
i destroyed everything i just
you make one wrong turn and then because of that after it all the turns are wrong
and you are so far from where you wanted to be
and youre lost and then youre lost
no one can help you find your way
a beat its up to you guido
up to you
in guidos face a soulful recognition that what shes said is true
a large piece of guidos set comes crashing down
dante and guido walk through the empty soundstage leaving behind the set which is being dismantled by a group of construction workers
old friends i have to come clean with you
guido faces his production team
this is hard for him
there is no movie
i cant pretend anymore
we have to stop
nothing more to say im sorry
there is silence in the room
the metal soundstage door opens as guido and dante walk through and into the sunlight
guido is defeated
he stops at his car and turns to dante
guido gets in his car
guido drives away
dante watches him go
a cold wind blows
a lonely figure guido walks along a deserted beach
supertitle anguillara italy years later p
its the end of the season
only a few customers left in the cafe as the waiters close up for the day pulling down umbrellas stacking tables
guidos changed bearded hair longer and unkempt
he looks out to sea alone as the waves crash to and fro
a newspaper sits open in front of him
scribbles and heavy markings circle an ad for a theater production in rome
guido gets up at this moment starts to leave hesitates takes the paper folds it under his arm and exits the restaurant
he heads up the steps towards the promenade and we catch a glimpse of the profound regret in his eyes guido waits nervous in a doorway across the street from
a theatre thats presenting the pirandello play diana e la tuda starring luisa acari
luisa exits the theatre with the company of actors all of them plaited together in post performance bonhomie
guido watches from a distance
luisa takes the arm of a handsome male as they cross and head down the street
guido and lilli walk along the waterfront
people pass by occasionally
they talk im glad shes acting again
i made her costumes for the play
she seemed so happy
i didnt want to interfere
is she with anybody
guido shes my friend
im not her mother
i dont know
i expect so
nobody likes to be alone
promise me youre going to let me cut your hair and get rid of that awful beard
i like to get about without everybody pointing at me
and where are you getting about
just to be able to walk
are you seeing anybody
teasing well it sounds exciting
walking around and not seeing anyone growing a beard
i might come up here and join you
dont tease me lilli
my heart is i know
i just miss her
i should have idiot tattooed on my forehead
luisa certainly thinks so
grasping at this does she
did she really say that
im not going to act as a postman between you both
come back to rome
make a movie
go to work
lilli joins him
ive spent this time trying to learn something lilli to not be the person who forgets about everybody else the person who never grew up
youre such a dope arent you
making movies wasnt your problem
you were your problem
dont stop being a child
youll never make another movie
nobody wants that
she indicates the people who pass
guido there probably isnt a single person passing by who hasnt been touched in some way by one of your movies
thats your gift
thats what youve been given
just use it with some grace
doubtful the only movie i could make now would be
i dont know
would be about a man trying to win back his wife
after a beat the costumes might not be so bad too
flash lights from a makeup mirror
a glimpse of a female eye applying false eyelashes
flash a man of the collar applies pancake makeup while a cigarette dangles from his lips
young guido appears and whispers into guidos ear
were ready to begin
a surreal backstage the cast of guidos life whores models schoolboys priests etc
a show about to begin
the music of be italian folies bergere plays and builds throughout
people run past with props lights etc
showgirls are hurrying
a beautiful confusion
guido pulls up in his car outside the soundstage
he stops the engine and sits for a moment in silence
summoning his courage he gets out of the car
he is greeted by pierpaolo
he seems to need and acknowledge his support
pierpaolo is tender
i cant remember how you do this
the camera moves through the backstage mayhem
mamma is in her dressing room preparing
saraghina is sharing a dressing room with a priest
he is helping with her corset
carla and luigi
carla fixes her husbands hair
claudia and stephanie smoke and talk
lilli adjusts her own and other mens wardrobe
guido is in his element again locked in passionate discussion with an actor and an actress
in his hand an actual script
the set surrounding them is modest a tiny bedroom with a single window and rumpled sheets
the vast film italia has clearly given way to something smaller and perhaps truer the tale of a man and a woman
i dont want to say too much
the first way that we kill our film is by talking about it
but this scene is about reconciliation
and within the scene i would like you to try and find your way to begin that journey back towards each other
young guido rushes by the dressing rooms
take your places
the dressing rooms begin to empty
from high above on the soundstage catwalk young guido watches older guido at work
continuing to speak to his actors maybe its the most important building block that we have to begin again
we start from the beginning each time and i feel today as if im starting from the beginning
well just keep asking each other questions and dont look to me for the answers okay
on cue young guido opens the door behind him and ushers in the cast of guidos life
they enter with a sense of anticipation and excitement and arrange themselves on the staircases and scaffolding that loom behind guido
they are all dressed in angelic white
but guido is oblivious focused instead on the task that lies ahead
he talks to his cameraman
puts down his script
he takes off his jacket and hangs his glasses off his sweater stands contemplating the set in front of him
maestro should i call final checks
a long wide pan reveals a tableau vivant looming behind guido like a glorious choir his every muse his every inspiration
they watch him as he begins to work
a part of him now and forever
guido sits on the crane
the soundstage door opens and we see a small figure slip quietly onto the set
tentatively she steps through the shadows
from a discreet distance she watches her husband return to his gift
pierpaolo calls for silence
silencio per favore
to camera gyriamo
e alora motore
as the clapboard strikes
at the last moment young guido runs fast down the maze of steps across the soundstage and jumps onto the crane with guido as it begins to rise
as the last note plays the crane soars higher carrying guido up and up
