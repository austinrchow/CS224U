common pre flight instruction
a spotlight reveals ryan bingham standing at a podium
he unzips a backpack and sets it down beside him
how much does your life weigh
ryan pauses to let us consider this
imagine for a second that youre carrying a backpack
i want you to feel the straps on your shoulders
you feel them
gives us a beat now i want you to pack it with all the stuff you have in your life
start with the little things
the stuff in drawers and on shelves
the collectables and knick knacks
feel the weight as it adds up
now start adding the larger stuff
your clothes table top appliances lamps linens your tv
that backpack should be getting pretty heavy at this point go bigger
your couch your bed your kitchen table
stuff it all in
your car get it in there
your home whether you have a studio apartment or a two story house i want you to stuff it into that backpack
ryan takes a beat to let the weight sink in
now try to walk
we hear people around us chuckling
reveal the kind that shifts between lower income corporate retreats and lower income weddings
the few dozen people seem to be visualizing as told
kinda hard isnt it
this is what we do to ourselves on a daily basis
we weigh ourselves down until we cant even move
and make no mistake moving is living
we see nodding
peoples gears turning
now im going to set your backpack on fire
what do you want to take out of it
photos are for people who cant remember
drink some gingko and let the photos burn
in fact let everything burn and imagine waking up tomorrow with nothing
a beat of emphasis its kind of exhilarating isnt it
that is how i approach every day
a titter through the crowd
a female flight attendant is looking directly at us
do you want the cancer
turn to see ryan looking back
right now confused
do you want the cancer
ryan furrows what the hell is going on here
the flight attendant raises her hand to reveal a can of soda
the can sir
um no thank you
the flight attendant moves to the next aisle
ryan takes a beat then returns to his work
two words subordinate chic
seated at a tiny table is ryan
the grim reaper in a suit
we see a series of real people react to the news of being fired
they should be non actors actual victims of recent layoffs that can react organically to the news with authenticity
some are hurt
others are upset and even abusive
the series concludes with
whos on the verge of tears
who the fuck are you
freeze on ryan
who the fuck am i
poor steve has worked here for seven years
hes never had a meeting with me before
steve in a small meeting
or passed me in the hall
steve passes a female coworker
or told me a story in the break room
steve laughs at a coworkers story
and thats because i dont work here
i work for another company that lends me out to pussies like steves boss
steves boss sits at his desk
subtitle reads a big pussy who dont have the balls to sack their own employees
and in some cases for good reason
because people do crazy shit when they get fired
steve wipes off his bosss desk
steve shreds sensitive documents
steve pours bleach into the communal coffee pot
steve loads an assault rifle
he stands up to get a view of his coworkers on a coffee break
steve is trying to hold it together
and thats where i come in
what did i
what could i have done differently here
this is not an assessment of your productivity
its important not to personalize this
steve scoffs at this
ryan slides steve a packet
steve i want you to review this packet
take it seriously
i think youre going to find a lot of answers in there
oh im sure its going be really helpful
look anybody who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you are now
and its because they sat there that they were able to do it
and just for a moment steve looks hopeful
im going to need your key card
steve begins removing it from his wallet
take the day
put together your personal things
talk to your co workers
tomorrow go out and get some exercise
go for a jog
give yourself routines and pretty soon youll find your legs
steve nods and gets up to leave
just as hes about to walk out he stops and turns back
wait how do i get in touch with you
well be in touch soon
this is just the beginning
steve nods and exits the room
ill never see steve again
the choreography of ryans packing is worthy of tchaikovsky
a coat slides off a hanger
a travel toothbrush folds closed like a switchblade
a briefcase clicks onto a roll away bag
a hand flips a light switch without looking
ryan is at the check out desk
do you have your hilton honors card with you
he hands it to her close enough to camera that we get a nice big close up of it
she runs the card and the screen pops up with information that makes her blush
oh my god
do you like live at the hilton
ryan nods in faux modesty
ryan pulls up to one of the spaces marked with the gold presidents club emblem
he hops out and a uniformed man with a handheld device begins to punch in the license plate number
ryan pulls out his hertz presidents club card and places it nice and close to lens so we can see it
the card slides through the handheld device and we see the digital number increase by a few thousand points
the automated glass doors slide open
ryan enters the concourse and takes a deep breath of the temperately controlled air
he has arrived
this is where i live
ryan skips the long lines and steps directly into the aadvantage executive platinum line
glorious close up of ryans aadvantage executive platinum card sliding through the automated machine
were it any sexier wed hear a moan
maybe we even do
immediately the airport clerk registers and perks up
pleasure to see you again mr
when i run my card the system automatically prompts the desk clerk to greet me with this exact statement
we see it again
pleasure to see you again mr
ryan nods back to the clerk
had my status simply been gold or god forbid silver
i might have gotten a hello or a smile
ryan continues to hit buttons swiftly checking in
loyalty is earned and rewarded with these small touches
its these kinds of systemized friendly touches that keep my world in orbit
a ticket begins printing
ryan snaps it up
ryan steps up and observes his line choices
he finds a few asian businessmen and hops in behind them
its a beautiful choreographed ballet of a bag handle collapsing shoes coming off a laptop going in a separate tray wallet and watch sliding into a shoe a boarding card
sliding into a back pocket
both hands always moving performing separate actions
it really is gorgeous
ryan enters and presents his admirals club card
it has a hologram
the admirals club hostess immediately smiles
welcome back mr
ryan walks past a stack of newspapers on the way to the buffet the whole time framed by an enormous window overlooking the tarmac
all the things you probably hate about travelling the recycled air
the artificial lighting
the digital juice dispensers and mini pizzas stacked to their heat lamps are the warm reminders that i am home
with that comment ryan slides into a leather club seat
a digital display reads thank you for your loyalty
he opens his briefcase and pulls out his itinerary
he scans it
we see a string of flights car rentals and stays at hitons
then something makes him frown
he pulls out his cell phone and dials
ryans assistant kevin is not happy to be there
ryan binghams office
you have me in a dodge stratus in kansas city
they are completely out of all full sized sedans
not the first time yes i reminded them of your remarkable gold club status and years in the program
they are moving mountains to see you in a sebring
any other messages
your sister kara called
needs to speak urgently about your sisters wedding
i told her you were midair and not even i knew your final destination
and you got an invitation to speak at goalquest in vegas
we push in on an easel with a sign that features ryans headshot
underneath his name it reads whats in your backpack
ryan delivers his speech with a smile
every once in a while i do speaking engagements
motivational kind of stuff
were talking major tony robbins shit
kevin examines the invitation emblazoned with a big xx
its got a hologram
theyre calling it dos equis
thats some pretty major tony robbins shit there
talk about burying the lead
ill check in when
hold on i have craig gregory for you
four words store bought sports memorabilia
hows the road warrior
twenty minutes from boarding into a world of bliss
great numbers out of phoenix
you know big auto is going to drop another k this month
yeah christmas came early
wish i could have you in five places at once
i need you back in omaha by the end of the week
i thought you needed me everywhere
we got something big game changer
i dont know why you ever bring me in
wherever i go the money follows
let me plant seeds theyll grow to oaks
craig checks out a cute intern
im thinking of planting seeds right now
what are we talking about here
today i took my first crap in two weeks
thats me hanging up on you
i love that sound
ryan sits one row behind the bulkhead
to know me is to fly with me
im the aisle youre the window trapped
reveal a man next to ryan
some businessman between cities
he talks drink in hand but we dont hear him
we start chatting impersonally at first
our moderate politics our sinking opinions on the american service industry
you recommend a hotel in tulsa
i tip you off to a rib joint in fort worth
you tell me your best joke
ive heard it before but listen anyway
ryan laughs out loud
nothing like turbulence to cement a bond
soon youre telling me about family
your wife just went back to work but you cant intervene because you sure could use the extra paycheck and besides last june she read some book and woke up
one morning a feminist
and that if your windfall ever came through youd quit and spend the rest of your days restoring vintage speedboats
saying it with him the water
thats where you belong
their plane lands
as the plane begins to taxi to the gate both ryan and the businessman pull out their cards
we exchange cards and slot them next to countless others
the dull bell dings to let us know its safe to stand
ryan and the businessman get up and open the overheads
fast friends arent my only friends but my best friends
ryan and the businessman walk next to each now completely ignoring each other as if they never shared a word
were a busy bunch
im in my element here
i suppose im a sort of mutation a new species
i live between the margins of my itineraries
ryan and the businessman reach a point that separates connecting flights go left long term parking goes right
they share an awkward smile with a nod then head in their separate directions
ryan is checking out ties when his cell phone rings
he checks the i
he weighs it for a second
ryan mouths a silent fuck
kara is ryans sister
her home overflows with books photos family collectables and kids artwork
every family has one person who is the glue
the one who keeps the genealogy in check
thats my sister kara the glue
it just so happens that kara is gluing her daughters school project mobile together
how are you holding up
matthew made varsity
hows the road
ryan exits the store and we realize we are in
ryan hops onto a people mover
couldnt be better
i didnt even want to have to ask you for this because i know how you are about
doing things for others
ryan rolls his eyes
but were coming in on three weeks to go for julies wedding and theres something we could really use your help on
weve been sending people these kits so they can print out photos of julie and jim on cardboard and take photos of them in interesting places kind of like that
gnome in the french movie
because its julies wedding
and she thinks its fun
does it matter why
how is julie
would you call her
she thinks youve turned to butter disappeared
youre awfully isolated the way you live
your assistant told me youre going to be in vegas
can you get a photo of the cut out in front of the luxor pyramid
that place is a shit hole
no one stays there
jesus ryan im not asking you to check in
can you just take a stupid photo
im going to try my best
well thank you for trying your best
ryan sits at one of the couch table set ups
hes going over some paperwork
he notices an attractive professionally dressed woman alex sifting through her purse
she sets a pair of car keys with a maestro tag on the table
youre satisfied with maestro
yeah i am
theyre stingy with their miles
i like hertz
hertz keeps its vehicles too long
if a cars over twenty thousand miles i wont drive it
ryan is intrigued
maestro doesnt instant check out
i like to park and go
hertz doesnt guarantee navigation
funny you dont seem like a girl who needs directions
i hate asking for directions
thats why i get a nav
the new outfit colonial isnt bad
is that a joke
after a beat
their kiosk placement is a joke
never have available upgrades
its basically a fleet of shit boxes dont know how theyre still in business
i love you im ryan
so are you going to join me
she breaks into a smile
empty glasses litter the table
ryan and alex have taken over a couch and have the contents of their wallets spread out all membership cards
grabs one of alexs cards maplewood card
how dare you bring that into this palace
hilton offers equal value and better food but the maplewood gives out warm cookies at check in
they got you with the cookies
im a sucker for simulated hospitality
theres actually an industry term for that
its a mixture of faux and homey
alex grabs ryans american concierge key card
oh my god
ive heard about these but never seen one in person
is this a
i love the weight
i was pretty excited the day that puppy came in
i put up pretty pedestrian numbers
sixty thou a year domestic
thats not bad
dont patronize me
whats your total
thats a personal question
i hardly know you
show some hubris
i bet its huge
you have no idea
holds her hands eight is it this big
extends a few inches this big
lets just say ive got a number in mind and i havent hit it yet
alex smiles fair enough
admires the concierge key card
this is pretty fucking sexy
i hope it doesnt cheapen our relationship
were two people who get turned on by elite status
we may have to settle for cheap
theres nothing cheap about loyalty
alex looks into ryans eyes and gives him unspoken permission to take her right there and then
ryan and alex walk down a curved corridor suppressing laughter
theres no adult way to go back to somebodys hotel room
once at the door ryan tries his key card but it doesnt work
he reaches into his pocket and comes up with five other key cards from recent trips
i really have to start throwing these out
he tries a couple
we can always use that room with the ice machine
he finds the right key and opens the door
everything is scattered from a marathon fuck
ryan and alex are laying on the bed sprawled out on their backs like murder victims
good call on the towel rack
i liked how you burritoed me in the sofa cushions
i was improvising
too bad we didnt make it to the closet
we got to do this again
im in newark on the th madesto on the th oklahoma city on the th
im swinging through albuquerque the week of the th
no but ill be in florida by the th
they simultaneously type each other into their calendars
i should probably go back to my room so i can wake up in my bed
i think thats the lady like thing to do
ryan drops alex off at her door
she flips the do not disturb on her door handle and kisses ryan good night
the door closes
ryan smiles to himself
sprinklers doing their job
looking through the first floor window we see ryan doing laps in the pool
ryan gets a shoe shine
the clerk swipes ryan card
a car return clerk slides ryans card through a device
ryan swipes his frequent flier card through the automated machine
a female desk assistant notices the number looks up at ryan and has a tiny orgasm right there
ryan looks out the oval window to the landscape of omaha
last year i spent three hundred twenty two days on the road
ryan wheels passed a couple that leaps into each others arms
which means that i had to spend forty three miserable days at home
ryan steps up to an upscale building with little character searching for his keys at the bottom of his bag
finally finds them and opens the front door
ryan presses his floor when a nosey neighbor slides in
doesnt know his name hi
feels like its been months busy man
we missed you at our summer party
yeah sorry i couldnt be there
weve been trying to get a vote on the new landscaping
can i e mail you the plans
wed love to get a final tally
ill go with the majority
sometimes i forget that you even live here
you could probably save money and move into a hotel
i looked into it but the irs requires a permanent address for employment
otherwise they classify you as a vagrant
ryan gets off at his floor
ryan walks in and sets his bag down
reveal the place is empty
like empty empty
ryan opens the fridge chinese take out
bottle of vodka
takes a whiff of something not good
ryan turns to find dianne a pretty woman just shy of forty
they hug its just intimate enough to know theyve violated the rules of sleeping with your neighbors
hands over a package i signed for this while you were gone
hope it wasnt a bother
ryan opens it and finds the cut out of his sister julie and her fiance jim
its an eighteen inch card stock photo of jim hugging julie from behind
they seem happy
its my sister
shes getting married
havent met the guy yet
lots of luck
i know right
they share a smile
then dianne goes to leave
its good to see you
feels like a while this time
hey you want to come over tonight
dianne gets a little uncomfortable
actually i kind of started seeing somebody
yeah were having drinks tonight if you want to come over
i think ill settle in
dianne gives a smile nod and exits
ryan take another long look at the cut out
he shakes his head
a downtown midsize high rise
the company has piled in standing room only
assistants and interns watch through the windows
craig addresses the group including his own superiors
just thrilled to have everyone under one roof
welcome home boys
a couple odd looks from road warriors a decade his senior
i know theres are lot of whispering about why were all here
retailers are down twenty percent
auto industry is in the dump
housing market doesnt have a heartbeat
this is our moment
its one of the worst times on record for america
and i dont want to be standing here two years from now wondering how we missed this window of opportunity
a strangely encouraged response from the group
now last summer we received a dynamite young woman by way of cornell
she challenged us with some big ideas
my first reaction was who does this kid think she is
but when i started to give a listen i was pretty knocked out
so now with a little peek into our future natalie keener
natalie stands up
if theres one word i want to leave you with today its this
natalie clicks on her power point presentation
everyone including ryan attempts to pronounce it
our global must become local
power point slide a slide shows people x
this company keeps twenty three people on the road at least two hundred fifty days a year
its expensive and its inefficient
when i came to craig three months ago with this he told me and quite astutely its only a problem if you have a solution
well today i stand before you with jus that
she turns around and fires up her monitor
sitting in a video conference session is a young man in a suit
you all know ned in reception
various people say hello to ned
today im going to fire ned
im sure h
will hire you back this afternoon
people chuckle in the conference room
one guy jokes dont count on it
ned could be any employee in any one of our clients locations worldwide
strategy packets would be shipped in advance
ned would be given a seat and find one of our transition specialists waiting for him
natalie turns to the monitor and proceeds to fire ned
it is a pretty dry process and lacks ryans charm
laskin the reason were having this conversation today is your position is no longer available
from a script i dont understand
hearing the words youve been let go is never easy
change is always scary
but consider the following using ryans line anybody who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you are now
and its because they sat there that they were able to do it
thats my fucking line
well what happens now
this is the first step of a process that will end with you in a new job that fulfills you
yeah but how does it work
i want you to take that packet in front of you
ned picks up the packet
all the answers youre looking for are inside
start filling out the necessary information and before you know it youll be on your way to new opportunities
ned starts to peruse the packet with fake interest
now ned im going to need you to go back to your desk and start putting together your things
as a favor to me id appreciate it if you didnt spread the news just yet
panic doesnt help anybody
have a good day mr
laskin and good luck with your future
ned gets up and goes to leave
give it up for ned
people clap and tease him a little
power point an animation of one monitor becoming multiple monitors all tied into a central switch board in the middle of a map of the country
you can start the morning in boston stop in dallas over lunch and finish the day in san francisco
all for the price of a t line
our inflated travel budget is eviscerated by eighty five percent
and most importantly to you guys on the road
no more christmases in a hotel in tulsa
no more hours lost to weather delays
you get to come home
ryan is in a state of silent panic
ryan enters and stops short
tell me youre not taking this seriously
yeah thats why we brought the entire company in from the road because were not taking this seriously
it doesnt make any sense
who am i even talking to
theres a methodology to what i do
a reason why it works
ryan coke and ibm have been doing it for years
just like anything theres a few months of transition but everyone settles in
who are you taking off the road
you dont get it
youre grounded ryan
okay what we do here is brutal and leaves people devastated but theres a dignity to the way i do it
stabbing people in the chest instead of the back
ryan rolls his eyes
craigs door opens and natalie pops her head in
you wanted to see me
craig goes to wave her off
yeah why dont you come in
natalie is confused but takes the chair next to ryan
great job in there nat
hows everyone taking it
natalie and ryan hold a look for a second
look i appreciate your
and you have some good ideas
but you know nothing of the realities of my job
sure you can set up an ichat
but you dont know how people think
actually i minored in psychology
okay kiddo fire me
ryan stop it
shes going to be doing this on a regular basis
you dont want to know if she can fire somebody
she just fired ned
my dog could fire ned
its okay i got this
ryan and natalie turn to face each other
bingham i regret to inform you that your position is no longer available
who the hell are you
my name is miss keener and im here today to discuss your future
i dont know you
the only person who can fire me is craig gregory
gregory hired me to handle this for him
gregory hired me and hes the only one who can fire me
im going to talk to him
ryan gets up
natalie gets up too
you cant follow me
youre on a computer screen
ryan sits back down
i just did
actually you didnt
now fire me
stop it ryan
bingham im here today to inform you that your position is no longer available
yes youre fired
never say fired
youve been let go
breaks the moment this is a mythical situation
how could i possibly know why
you never know why
why doesnt matter
back on track its important not to focus on the why and rather to spend your energy thinking about your future
im going to spend my energy on suing you if you dont give me a reason that youre firing me
bingham the reason is not important
oh so youre firing me without grounds
now i really have a lawsuit
ryan i think we know what youre trying to say
still in character dont take this personally mr
quiet and calm this is the most personal situation you will ever enter
so before you try to revolutionize my business id like to know that you actually know my business
ryan is staring out his window watching a plane take flight
hell of a way to welcome her to the team
am i the only one who sees that by automating our own business were making ourselves irrelevant
were making you irrelevant
ryan shoots a look
hey dont blame me
blame fuel costs
blame insurance premiums
watch yourself ryan
youre too young to be a dinosaur
im not a dinosaur
i want you to show her the ropes
what do i know about what happens around here
have ferguson do it
im not talking about here
a beat as ryan registers what craig means the road
hey you seem pretty confident that this girl doesnt know what shes doing
i just dont think a myspace page qualifies you to rewire an entire company
well heres your chance
show her the magic
take her through the paces
im not a fucking tour guide
craig cups one of his hands and places a folded post it between his fingers like a ships sail
re his hand this is the boat
craig raises his other finger far away
re his finger this is you
a beat of ryan taking in this ridiculous illustration
do you want to be in the boat
ryan were ringing the bell
rounding everybody up
if you want to stay out there a little longer you can
but youre not going to be on your own
begins to leave let me know
ryan is packing his roll away bag
it is practiced and systematic
hes just about finished when he notices the cut out of his sisters engagement photo
he tries placing it in the open bag but it is immediately clear that the photo is two inches to long
he tries putting it on an angle but that doesnt help
ryan centers the cut out again and tries to zip around it but he cant get the zipper around the heads of the photo
for a moment it almost seems like hes assaulting their tiny head with the zipper handle
a moment of silent frustration
being pulled through an airport
the little heads of ryans sister and her fiance are poking out the top of the bag
the two zippers have been closed on either side of them as though they were tiny passengers peeking out the sunroof
ryan cuts right through the crowd wheeling his carry on towards the automatic check in machines
ryan stops when he notices natalie saying goodbye to her boyfriend a kind of hollister looking guy in his mid twenties
hes not thrilled by the public affection
after a beat they break and he exits
natalie sees ryan and starts dragging her large suitcase towards him
the scraping against the terrazzo sends a shiver up ryans spine
she arrives and sets the heavy bag down with a clunk
ryan stares at her travel case for a beat then up to her
ryan pulls one out and tests the action
i really like my luggage
thats exactly what it is
off of natalies look you know how much time you lose by checking in
i dont know maybe five minutes waiting for
thirty five minutes per flight
i travel two hundred seventy days a year
that makes one hundred fifty seven hours
thats seven days
points to her luggage you ready to throw away a whole week on that
natalie is attempting to repack her new bag in the middle of the airport
ryan helps by throwing a couple things out
ryan spots various bad lines then sees a group of asians
ryan starts walking
you cant be serious
as they pass the first line a family of six
never get behind people travelling with infants
ive never seen a stroller collapse in less than twenty minutes
second line an elderly couple old people are worse
their bodies are littered with hidden metal and they never seem to appreciate how little time they have left on earth
third line a couple middle eastern guys
randomly selected for additional screening
they enter the fourth line behind the asians
theyre light packers treasure efficiency and have a thing for slip on shoes
im like my mother
ryan is just fastening his belt having just gone through security when we hear a beeping go off
natalie is trying to find the metal on her body that has set off the machine
she also has forgotten to take her laptop out of her bag
its a mess
ryan is sketching a theoretical book cover for the backback
natalie is working on an excel document on her laptop shes a loud tapper
hitting the keys with violent strokes
it draws ryans attention and a raised eyebrow
are you upset at your laptop
fats domino had a lighter touch
i type with purpose
what are you working on so furiously
im building a work flow of firing techniques
a script that works kind of like a tributary taking you through the steps of firing someone
who is it for
theoretically you could put it in the hands of anybody and they could be downsizing immediately
all they have to do is follow the steps
natalie what is it you think we do here
we prepare the newly unemployed for the emotional and physical hurdles of job hunting while
minimizing potential legal blowback
thats what were selling
but its not what were doing
okay what are we doing
our job is to make limbo tolerable to ferry wounded souls across the river of dread and humiliation to the point at which hopes bright shore is dimly visible
and then to stop the boat shoveem in the water and make them swim while we row back to the palace of their banishment to present the employers with our
that was really impressive
you rehearse that
natalie smiles and goes back to her work
ryan goes to say something but holds back for now
ryan zips through the wandering types as natalie tries to keep up
ryans phone rings
he sees the caller id
i got to grab this
ill meet you at the rental lot
natalie nods and keeps moving
ryan picks up
hey i was hoping id hear from you
alex is on her cell phone as a junior behind her folds a portable projector screen
im in hotlanta
i need a rib joint recommend bad
bring a bib
ryan turns into an elevator well to talk
you havent called
you know i didnt know what was appropriate
she moves to a quieter place
ryan im not some waitress you banged in a snow storm
the word appropriate has no place in our collective vocabulary
im the woman you dont have to worry about
this sounds like a trick
next time youre worried about manners dont
if you want to call call
just think of me as yourself
only with a vagina
ryan lights up
this woman fucking rocks
when am i going to see you
im out of hartsfield into iad then a connection at ord into sdf
tell me about it
how long is your layover in ohare
theyve got multiples into sdf
think you could push
i can push
ryan and natalie ride briefcases in hand
natalie is swaying back and forth
is she nervous
ding the elevator door opens
ryan and natalie enter the door to find a reception desk on an empty floor
scattered telephones sit on the ground where desks used to be
a few desks in one corner are still manned
natalie tries not to show its all becoming very real
to desk girl ryan bingham from ctc
the desk girl looks up from her work
she knows who they are
ryan and natalie pass rows of cubicles
heads begin to pop up to see their arrival
natalie accidentally makes eye contact with one guy then quickly shifts her gaze forward
ryan and natalie sit next to each other at a polyurethane conference table
all you have to do today is watch and listen
when i talk about the strategy packet
you hand them one of these
ryan points to a stack of packets
you ever find it strange that termination comes with a packet
everything important in life comes with a packet
a series of real people sit down across from ryan and natalie thank you for coming by
as youre probably well aware this is a tough economic climate and your company is not immune
real people tighten up as they begin to catch on
while i wish i was here with better news the reason you and i are meeting is this is your final week of employment here
real people blame all sorts of people and situations that they personally hold responsible
this is not a time to look for blame
your position simply no longer exists
real people respond further
some are enraged
some are polite
one is even grateful
i understand why you are saying these things
its perfectly natural to feel this way
i want you to take the next week to explore this strategy packet
ryan nods to natalie who we now see begrudgingly handing packets to all of the real people weve already met
fill out the skill set work sheet
use the hopes and dreams diagram
and the tree of aspirations
we see the tree of aspirations sheet
the answers are all in there
we see more packets getting handed out as ryan repeats
the answers are all in there
are all in there
and what do you suggest i tell them
dry red eyes from tears of rage stare down the lens
natalie cant hold back any longer
perhaps youre underestimating the positive effect your career transition may have on your children
ryan looks at natalie like shes out of her mind
well tests have shown that children under moderate trauma have a tendency to apply themselves academically as a method of coping
go fuck yourself
thats what my kidsll think
ryan immediately covers
your childrens admiration is important to you
well i doubt they ever admired you bob
bob looks up shocked and pissed
hey asshole arent you here to console me
im not a shrink bob
im a wake up call
you know why kids love athletes
because they screw lingerie models
no thats why we love athletes
kids love them because they follow their dreams
yeah well i cant dunk
but you can cook
natalie looks to ryan where is he going with this
what are you talking about
ryan picks up bobs resume
your resume says you minored in french culinary arts
most students work the frier at kfc
you bussed tables at il picatorre to support yourself
then you got out of college and started working here
looks up at bob how much did they first pay you to give up on your dreams
twenty seven thousand a year
at what point were you going to stop and go back to what made you happy
bob simply shrugs
do you believe in fate bob
you know the mysterious ways in which we wind up doing the things we were meant to do
i met my wife at a gas station
well i think fate is telling you to do something bob
bob looks up and meets eyes with ryan
i see guys who work for the same company their entire lives
never a moment of happiness
pauses for effect not everyone gets this kind of opportunity
the chance for rebirth
if not for yourself
do it for your kids
bobs eyes begin to water again
hes a changed man
ryan shoots natalie a look hand over the packet
natalie jumps to attention and hands bob a packet
theres a business woman waiting in the regular line
ryan walks right past her and gets into the elite line
they are now both first in their respective lines for the counter
the woman looks over at ryan and sighs
natalie holds back confused by ryans actions and wanting to avoid confrontation
the desk clerk frees up and gestures for ryan to step forward
ryan begins wheeling his bag forward
meanwhile the woman lifts her hand in outrage
ive been waiting ten minutes
he just waltzes in and gets to cut in line
we reserve priority assistance for our hilton honors members
ryan grabs a brochure for elite membership off the desk and hands it to the business woman
you should look into it the promotions are great
the woman bats it out of ryans hand onto the floor
ryan looks back at the desk clerk and smiles
the desk clerk swipes his card
ryans digital number bumps up another thousand points
natalie is washing her hands when she stops to look at herself in the mirror
after a beat she hears someone crying in one of the stalls
she goes to see if the woman is okay then stops herself maybe i fired her
she grabs a paper towel dries off her hands and leaves
natalie sits back down at the table a little visibly shaken
just then their food arrives
and theres a lot of food
natalies eyes move back and forth trying to figure out why there seems to be three main courses and a bunch of sides
our expense account allots for forty dollars each on dinner
i plan on grabbing every mile i can
okay you got to fill me in on this mile business
whats that all about
are you talking like frequent flier miles
ryan gives natalie a look is she ready for this information
your really want to know
im dying to know
i dont spend a nickel if i can help it unless it somehow profits my mileage account
im not talking hotel rooms and rental cars either but internet services cell phone music downloads teleflorists
i shop them according to the miles they pay and i pit them against each other for the most value
so what are you saving up for
south of france
no its not like that
the miles are the goal
youre saving to save
lets just say ive got a number in mind and havent hit it yet
seems a little abstract
whats your target
id rather not
its a secret target
its ten million miles
isnt ten million just a number
pi is just a number
i guess we all need a hobby
ryan looks back at natalie hobby
oh hey i didnt mean to belittle your collection
i get it
id be the seventh person to do it
more people have walked on the moon
do they give you a parade or something
lifetime exec platinum status
you get to meet the chief pilot maynard finch
they put your name on the side of a plane
men get such a hard on from putting their name on stuff
you guys dont grow up you just need to pee on everything
now whos stereotyping
fear of mortality
its like yes youre going to die one day
and why do you suppose thats singular to men
probably cause you cant have babies
ryan cant help but laugh a little
if i had that many miles id just show up at the airport look up at one of those big destination boards pick a place and go
this idea sinks in for a second with both of them
ryan is laying in bed wearing a hilton bathrobe
hes reviewing his sisters wedding invite when his blackberry buzzes on the night stand
he reaches over to check it
its a text message alex cant fall asleep
ryan types back ryan me too
just laying here
alex is in a t shirt lying in bed
she types away at her blackberry and presses send
ryans blackberry buzzes again
alex you should rub one out
thanks for the advice
ryan only fair if you do too
blackberry buzzes again
alex way ahead of you
ryan call me next time so i can listen
alex have sweet dreams about me
he stares at the message for a second then sets the blackberry down and turns off the light
natalie is standing with a camera in her hands giving directions
left left left left
one more inch
reveal ryan is placing the cut out of julie and jim
the camera pov makes it look like julie and jim are standing in front of st
louis international airport
i dont get it
my sister is cooky
she thinks this is charming
like the gnome thing
no i mean
why would your sister want a fake photo in front of the st
she should be so lucky to visit lambert field
the wright brothers flew through there
points out the conical the domed main terminal was the first of its kind
a precursor to everything from jfk to degualle
natalie takes the photo
why she wants dozens of reminders of all the places she hasnt been is beyond me
well im sure shes going to be crushed for having missed this airport
look before lindbergh could cross the atlantic he took off from one of those runways
ever wondered why they call it the spirit of st
ryan goes to say something but natalie is already gone
ryan and natalie sit stoically as a young asian guy rants about why they are idiots to fire him
and another thing
you know how fucked this place is without me
you know how fucked this place is without me
fucked in the ass man
young asian guy contd i am the one thing preventing this place from being totally fucked in the ass
the young asian guy snaps up one of the packets and leaves slamming the door behind himself
sometimes they just need to vent
please for the love of god can i fire the next one
ryan gives it some thought
a professional african american woman wearing a smart suit sits down at the conference table
natalie sits up
im here to be fired right
were here to talk about your future
you dont have to sugar coat it
i get the drill
what are they offering
inside the packet youll find a clearly worked out severance package
give me the bullet points
three months pay
six months medical
a full year of placement services through our company ctc
commonly it takes one month of searching for every ten thousand dollars you expect to earn in salary
so i could be looking for a while
oh dont sweat it
im pretty confident about my plans
can you tell me
is high tide in the morning or the evening
i dont know
theres this beautiful bridge by my apartment
i need to figure out what time to jump off it
natalie begins to tremble
natalie bursts out the doors and sits on a bench
shes freaked out
ryan is five steps behind her
he puts a hand on her shoulder
people say these things all the time
it comes with the trade
people are always saying crazy stuff
they get worked up
she was so calm
not quite sure i think thats a good sign
so they dont actually ever do it
its just talk
how do you know
do you follow up
i mean no nothing good can come of that but i dont think you should worry about it
natalie is clearly still worried
this is the job
taking people at their most fragile moment and setting them adrift
looking out the window at the passing landscape
over the pastures and roads we see graphic white lines and numbers denoting each mile as they click by
ryan tears a page out of american way magazine outlining their mileage program and hands it to natalie
ryan turns a corner to find natalie talking to her computer screen with headphones on
shes having an ichat with someone but we only hear her side of the conversation
ryan decides to listen in for a second
ill be back soon
not really sure how long this whole exercise is supposed to last
its hard for these guys to accept change you know
listens rolls eyes i
im not even going to answer that
no i cant even think of him that way
checks a mirror
a touches down on the runway
ryans headshot sitting on an easle
ryan stands before a similar crowd as the opening of the film
this is where it gets a little difficult but stay with me
you have a new backpack
but this time i want you to fill it with people
start with casual acquaintances people around the office friends of friends and work your way to the people you trust with your most intimate secrets
now move into family members cousins aunts and uncles
get your sisters and your brothers and you parents
get them all in that backpack
and finally your husband or wife or boyfriend or girlfriend
get them in their too
a titter through the crowd
for the first time we see natalie near the side watching
im not going to ask you to light it on fire
feel the weight of that bag
make no mistake your relationships are the heaviest components of your life
feel the straps cutting into your shoulders
all those negotiations and arguments and secrets and compromises
ryan lets the weight sink in
now set that bag down
you can feel the relief in the room
you dont need to carry all that weight
some animals were meant to carry each other
to live symbiotically over a lifetime
star crossed lovers
we are not one of those animals
ryan focuses towards his conclusion
the slower we move the faster we die
we are not swans
ryan has finished his session and is talking to eager stragglers
ryan accepts a business card and elaborates on one of his theories
meanwhile down the hall natalie is finishing a phone call
she looks shell shocked
she closes her phone and pockets it in silence
an american airlines plane touches down
were following a hilton shuttle down a street of palm trees
natalie and ryan ride back to the airport
we catch them mid conversation as natalie drills ryan on his theory
ryan smiles to the few other riders as if apologizing
you never want to get married
never want kids
is that so bizarre
yes it is
i dont see the value
sell it to me
sell me marriage
how how about love
how many stabile marriages do you know
someone to talk to spend your life with
im surrounded by people to talk to
i doubt that will change
the shuttle stops and everyone goes to grab their bags
ryan and natalie enter still having the same conversation
how about just not dying alone
ryan stops to address this
starting when i was twelve we moved each one of my grandparents into a nursing facility
my parents went the same way
make no mistake
we all die alone
ryan turns thinks of something then turns back
those cult members down in san diego with the white sneakers and little dixie cups of kool aid
they didnt die alone
natalie looks steamed
just saying theres options
out of nowhere natalie starts crying
natalie is now balling in the middle of the lobby
brian left me
ryan goes to hug natalie and she simply folds into his arms a mop of tears
ryan looks around for a place to set her down
instead he finds
alex who gives a questioning look to the young sobbing girl
alex this is natalie
natalie this is my
i should give you both a moment
natalie attempts a recovery
its not graceful
no its fine
just stupid emotions
natalie gives alex a firm handshake
maybe a drink
ryan goes to challenge the idea when
now were talking
natalie leads the way
alex and ryan exchange quick hellos
text reads i think its time we c other people the three share a booth
natalie is sipping a drink
she seems to have settled a little
he broke up with you over text message
thats kind of like firing people over the internet
both natalie and alex shoot ryan a look
re the ex boyfriend what a weasely prick
yeah but what does that make me
someone who falls for a prick
we all fall for them
pricks are spontaneous unpredictable and fun
and then were surprised when they turn out to be pricks
i followed him to omaha
i had a job waiting for me in san fran when he got an offer from conagra
he told me we could start a life together
so i followed him
i look in the mirror and i just see compromise
im supposed to do something
youll do plenty
i just cant
i thought id be engaged by now
when i was sixteen i thought by twenty three i would be married maybe have a kid
corner office by day entertaining at night
i was supposed to be driving a grand cherokee by now
life can underwhelm you that way
now i have my sights on twenty nine because thirty is just way too
i mean where did you think youd be by
natalie catches herself having no idea how old alex is
it doesnt work that way
at a certain point you stop with the deadlines
they can be a little counterproductive
i dont want to say anything thats
i mean i really appreciate everything your generation did for me
it was our pleasure
but sometimes it feels like no matter how much success i have it all wont matter until i find the right guy
you really thought this guy was the one
yeah i guess
i dont know
i could have made it work
he just really fit the bill
you know white collar
likes funny movies
six foot one
works in finance but is outdoorsy you know on the weekends
we think shes done i always imagined hed have a single syllable name like matt or john or
in a perfect world he drives a four runner and the only thing he loves more than me is his golden lab
and a nice smile
back to alex and ryan how about you
this catches both alex and ryan off guard
im not sure if
i meant alex
huh let me think for a sec
mulls it over well by the time youre thirty four all the physical requirements are pretty much out the window
i mean you secretly prey hell be taller than you
not an asshole would be nice
just someone who enjoys my company
comes from a good family you dont think about that when youre younger
healthy enough to play catch with his future son one day
we can tell ryan is taking a serious interest in this
please let him earn more than i do
that doesnt make sense now but believe me it will one day
otherwise its just a recipe for disaster
hopefully some hair on his head
but its not exactly a deal breaker anymore
yep a nice smile just might do it
alex looks to ryan
he has a nice smile
that was depressing
alex and ryan react its not that bad
i should just date lesbians
were no picnic ourselves
natalie looks worse than when the conversation started
i dont mind being married to my career and i dont expect it to hold me in bed as i fall asleep
i just dont want to settle
right now you see settling as some sort of failure
dont worry by the time someone is right for you it wont feel like settling
and the only person left to judge you will be the twenty four year old girl with a target on your back
natalie cracks a smile
ryan looks to alex
theyve grown closer
ryan alex and natalie wheel their roll aways towards the elevator
so whats the plan for this evening
ryan and alex share an uncomfortable silence
oh is it illicit
its nothing like that
we are in miami
we were going to hit that party for the tech conference in the hotel
natalie notices a group of software types mingling with badges around their necks
i didnt know you could just attend those
well i mean
youre going to crash it
i mean i dont know if
more money than they know these guy put on a quite a what to do with
no i get it
ryan alex and natalie confidently walk up to the check in table and take badges
they turn the corner
alex reads natalies badge
its going to be fine
corporate color balloons
lots of guys in logo polos
that great hip hop song from is playing over the pa
we find ryan alex and natalie at a stand up table
theyre now wearing badges
natalie is pretty tipsy at this point
you okay there
this was a great idea
you are so pretty
youre exactly what i want to look like in fifteen years
thank you natalie
a conference leader steps up to an on stage mic
hows everyone doing out there
so do ryan alex and particularly natalie
im going to need you to all put your hands together for a very special guest young
the opening beats of the s jam bust a move blast over the speakers and sure enough now year old rapper young mc steps out and starts rapping
everyone goes crazy and starts dancing
ryan and alex make it out to the dance floor
theyre awful dancers but theyre having fun
think shell be okay
natalie has already found a dancing partner who cant believe his luck
shes all over him
a nice two story yacht that was obviously purchased before the bubble popped
inside the galley a group is playing karaoke
natalie wearing badges like mardi gras beads is singing time after time
meanwhile near the back ryan and alex sit with their legs hanging off the back of the hull
back home i dont get to act the way i do with you
thats why i dont have a back home
youre so cool
empty back pack
ryan emotionally stumbles
you know about the back pack
i googled you
its what us modern girls do when we have a crush
did it bother you
well that depends
is the bag empty because you hate people or just the baggage they bring along
i dont hate people
im not exactly a hermit
you just dont want to be tied down
the whole responsibility thing
i dont think its even that
first time i ever flew i was sixteen
youre not going to answer
youre just going to tell me a story
smiles continues story it was january and i had just gotten my drivers license
the lakes were frozen over so we piled into my car and hit the ice to do donuts
when out of nowhere i hit a soft spot and the hood of my car tilted up and i was sinking backwards into the water
i literally started to drown
within a few seconds i black out
then i wake up in the sky
im in a helicopter laying on a stretcher
this guy in a uniform is telling me i was minutes away from dying
oh my god
relives it for a second so just as were hovering over the hospital i sit up
and from there i could see the whole western horizon
wed been flying twenty minutes
twenty minutes to reach a city id thought of as remote halfway across the state
a foreign capital
my parents had taught me we lived in the best place on earth but now i could see the world was really just one place and comparing didnt make much
and i remember thinking dont tell me this isnt an age of miracles
dont tell me we cant be everywhere at once
the idea settles in
ryan returns to the point
i dont know what originally sparked the back pack
i probably needed to be alone
recently ive been thinking that maybe i needed to empty the bag before i knew what to put back in
and now they kiss
its notably different from their previous kisses
now when they lock lips we are reminded why people kiss in the first place
then all of a sudden the lights go out on the boat
the motor has stopped
ryan and alex look back to find the software dude stepping out of the galley drunk
i think were out of gas
ryan and alex look out to shore
about yards away
for whatever reason they just start cracking up
ryan and alex are huddled under a blanket in the corner of the rubber boat as it putters its way to shore
cold soaked and smiling
natalie and david are there too
everyone gets out of the boat in the cold knee deep water and splashes up to shore
ryan and alex followed by natalie and her make out buddy soaked from the knee down holding their shoes scamper into the hotel on the balls of their feet
ryans eyes flutter awake to see alex getting dressed
hey youre up
got to fly stand by and make a meeting in milwaukee
notices teasing oh no
i made you feel cheap
yeah all right
just leave the money on the dresser
ill text you later so we can swap schedules
alex gives him a peck
ryan takes her wrist so she cant leave
i cant remember the last time i enjoyed spending time with someone as much as you
neither can i
they kiss again and he lets go
alex leaves and the door closes
ryan just lays in bed for a moment
ryan and natalie have a quiet breakfast
natalie looks pretty worse for wear
in the background is a traveling salesman rolling calls
he perks up for each message then goes back to being miserable
meanwhile after a little silent eating
last night got a little out of hand
i said things
i dont remember everything i said
i just didnt want you to think
it was nice to see you cut loose
so did you wake him up or slip out
your new friend
did you wake him for an awkward good bye or just slip out so he could feel like a whore
protocol is always tricky
i didnt know what was right
sometimes there really is no right thing to do
this doesnt comfort her
the walkway overlooks a large marina filled with giant yachts
ryan and natalie are doing the photo thing with the cut out of the engagement portrait again
what happened to alex
had to skip town early to make a meeting
thats too bad
where does she live
you thinking of going to see her
i dont know
we just dont have that kind of relationship
what kind of relationship do you have
its you know
sounds pretty special
it works for us
think theres any future there
never thought about it
whats going on here
really never thought about it
a good lie no
how can you not think about these things
how does it not even cross your mind that you might want to have a future with somebody
its simple you know that moment when you look into someones eyes and you feel them looking right into your soul and the whole world goes quiet for a second
finally a break through yes
well i dont
youre an asshole
natalie knocks over the cut out and stands up
oh come on im just dicking around
i need your help
dont you think its worth giving her a chance
a chance to what
a chance at something real
natalie your definition of real is going to evolve as you get older
would you stop condescending for one second
or is that one of the principles of your bullshit philosophy
is that supposed to be charming
no its simply a life choice
its a cocoon of self banishment
well screw you too
youve set up a way of life that basically makes it impossible for you to make any human connections
now somehow this woman runs the gauntlet of your ridiculous life choice and comes out the other end with a smile just so you can call her casual
i need to grow up
youre a twelve year old
natalie begins walking away
i dont have a gauntlet of
a gust of wind suddenly blows the cutout across the boardwalk into the ocean
ryan goes running after the cutout
he climbs down a gangway to a dock that is closest to the cutout which is beginning to sink in the filthy water
and just as hes got a finger tip on the photo
ryan still damp from the ocean is drying the cutout with a hair dryer
were following the cutout heads popping out of the roll away like earlier only now they are slightly faded and bent from their trip in the harbor
were watching ryan through the window of the plane
he almost looks trapped
the plane lands amidst snow
ryan and natalie drive in silence
the weather is frigid
these detroit guys can be tough
theyve been getting hammered
dont get distracted
stick to the simple stuff
get the packet in their hands and get them out the door
a one story brick building
theres an inch of snow on the ground
ryan and natalie enter the building in silence
ryan and natalie check in at the front desk
the door opens
ryan and natalie enter when they both see something and immediately stop short
sitting on the conference table is a computer set up for a framed up in a window on the screen is craig gregory
welcome to detroit
natalie and ryan exchange a look
whats going on here
ive been getting those great numbers over the last few days
thought we should nut up and give this a try
we could use a little more time
gotta leave the nest at some point
this is a real company craig
were here to do some damage
good thing we brought our best
so lets stop screwing around alright
just give me a minute to prepare and get my things together
i was thinking natalie takes this one
natalie once confident now takes pause
shes hardly ready for this
ive been watching her
re the webcam this is a whole other animal
i mean she created it
natalie you not up for it
ryan and natalie have a moment aside
just remember dont apologize
dont tell them how hard this is for you
today is one of the worst days they will ever have
what we feel doesnt even compare
just keep it professional
youre going to do fine
craig is leaning back in his office chair watching natalie on his monitor
an unsuspecting man in his mid fifties enters the room and takes a seat at a computer terminal
for the remainder of the scene we will intercut between natalies room and the pov of the mans ichat session
my name is natalie keener
checking out the pc whats going on here
i wish i was here with better news however your position here at deckers is no longer available
what are you talking about
youve been let go
what just like that
i cant believe
who are you
my name is miss keener
i am here to tell you about your options
i work here for seventeen years and they send some fourth grader in here to can me
what the fuck is this
ryan fights the urge to jump in
he is sitting next to natalie but just out of view of the camera
its perfectly normal to be upset
however the sooner you can tell yourself that there are greater opportunities waiting for you
im fifty seven fucking years old
samuels is now on the verge of tears
anybody who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you are now
and its because they sat there that they were able to do it
we remain in the room with natalie and ryan but we hear mr
its loud and embarrassing
its coming from the next room
hes literally on the other side of the wall
theres a packet in front of you
samuels picks up the packet and opens it
i want you to take some time and review it
samuels begins to leaf through
all the answers youre looking for are inside those pages
the sooner you trust the process the sooner your next step in life will unveil itself
samuels puts down the packet
the tears still coming slowly
i need you to return to your office now and begin to put together your personal things
samuels doesnt move
hes just sitting there in a daze
thank you for your time mr
just more silent tears
natalie is getting nervous
theres nothing else we can discuss now
thank you for your time
ryan fights the urge to break in as natalie continues to lose her composure
craig leans into his computer watching intently
finally samuels breaks from his daze
he looks up and around for a second then gets up and leaves
natalie catches her breath
a second later samuels passes their room visible through the conference room windows
they watch as he walks away
you did good
want me to take over
no im alright
natalie pulls out a list of forty names
the amount of people is daunting
she crosses off the first name
we find natalie standing next to the rental car
shes staring into a snow drift
her eyes say everything she just grew up
meanwhile ryan is on his cell
we catch the end of his conversation with craig
we just got out here
that was one place
i think we need to try a few more
maybe there isnt a difference but its comforting to know were in the next room
i know you dont give a shit about my comfort
we could just use a little more time
thats all im saying
shakes his head yeah
ryan hangs up
he thought you did a great job
you did i was real proud of you
were being pulled off the road
were going home
thats what it looks like
a moment of mixed emotions
ryan is holding the large embossed envelope of his sisters
he pulls out the response card looks at the line for extra guests then sets it down
he pulls out the actual invitation
it looks inexpensive
ryan and natalie ride the moving walkway
something is on natalies mind
she speaks up
im sorry about what i said about alex
i was out of line
i mean who am i to be dolling out relationship advice
you going to be okay
what do you mean
oh i dont know
its better than youd think
they get off the moving walkway and stop at a gate that reads omaha
something off screen grabs ryans attention
ryan begins to walk off
pulls out his blackberry and dials
ryan where are you going
grabbing another flight
something i need to take care of
ill see you in uh
ryan disappears in the crowd
were looking at the luxor pyramid
okay start walking it in from the left
alex enters frame carrying the engagement cut out
i have to admit when you asked me to meet you in vegas
i thought wed gamble make out in a heart shaped jacuzzi maybe see one of those weird french canadian circus shows
therell be plenty of time for all that
directing the photo one more foot to the left
she checks out the engagement photo
how do you feel about the wedding
im fine i guess
directing the photo okay great
ryan takes the photo
alex picks up the engagement photo
theyre a cute couple
yeah theyll make cute kids
if theyre lucky maybe look a little like you
alex and ryan look at the photo together for a second
how do you like wisconsin in february
i like it if youre there
besides i know a killer burger in milwaukee
what are you doing this weekend
this quickly registers
hes inviting me to the wedding
i havent even
im being serious
you want me to be your date
to a wedding
your sisters wedding
its not like i know her that well
im just not sure if its appropriate for me to
im not the wedding type
but for the first time in my life
i dont want to be that guy alone with his drink
i want a dancing partner
i want a plus one
and if you can stomach it id like it to be you
a long thoughtful beat
yeah i cant believe i
yeah im in
when is it
i feel like we should kiss or something
then kiss me
two roll aways side by side moving through the terminal
ryan and alex walk in unison
they share a smile
almost like they cant believe theyre getting away with something
they pass a large airline advertisement featuring maynard finch in uniform
we value your loyalty
ryans rental car pulls into the chalet suites driveway
its halfway between a swiss lodge and a best western
just a little sadder
a yellow sign reads welcome miller bingham wedding guests
ryan and alex approach the check in lines
of course theres an elite membership line but they cant use it
ryan is forced to stand in a queue of three people while a check in lady just stands at her computer at the elite line
to the check in lady are you available
sorry this line is for members of our matterhorn program
ryan and alex walk down the long hallway
theyve been given a room at the end
just as theyre entering their room the door across the hall opens revealing a woman in her early forties with a basket of laundry
its ryans sister kara
ryan turns and stops
its been a while
its a strange hug
awkward but heartfelt
alex this is my sister kara
ryan has told me nothing about you
kara what are you doing at a hotel
fuck i was hoping i wouldnt have to
yeah uh frank and i are trying out a trial separation
youre not staying at the house
there was an extra room on hold here so i just took it for the weekend
so you guys are dating
ryan and alex fumble over each other
its not exactly
hey dont worry about it
were all getting a little old to be calling someone girlfriend
i remember when mom used to call jack her boyfriend
it drove me up the wall
boyfriends are for kids
and im just a divorcee
an awkward beat in the corridor of the chalet suites
so the rehearsal dinner
yeah ill see you two there
kara humps the laundry basket down the hall
ryan and alex settle in
theres a cheap basket with a pink ribbon tied sloppily around some cellophane
in the basket is a packet outlining the wedding weekend
theres a packet
what in life is worth doing that doesnt have a packet
um i love you
ryan is kidding but not really
they play it off as a joke but cant help feel the weight of this moment
a group of tables have been slid together for the rehearsal dinner
ryan and alex find the dinner in full swing
ryans sister julie the bride waves wildly
oh my god ryan
she hops up and gives him a hug
you must be alex
you are so beautiful
kara was right
did you get the basket
the basket was very lovely
tammy wrapped all of them
ryan you look so grown up
youre the one getting married
i know right
you havent even seen my ring
julie shows off her ring
its not quite balanced and seems to favor quantity over quality
jim designed it
jim raises a hand
this is julies husband to be and we can tell immediately that ryan isnt thrilled
ryan thinks of something
he pulls out the x photos they took of the jim julie cut out
i brought those photos you were asking for
they go over there
julie points to a table and ryan walks over
when he gets there we see almost a hundred photos pinned to a map of america
all of a sudden his effort seems miniscule
ryan begins to pin his photos on the map over the cities where they were taken
he backs away to see it as a whole and his addition has already become invisible
ryan returns to the conversation with his sister and alex
there were quite a few already up there
almost couldnt find room
i know isnt it great how everyone chipped in
what gave you the idea to do something so
well jim has a lot of our nest egg invested in this real estate venture right now
so when we went over our finances a honeymoon just didnt seem affordable this second
so i thought
hey just because we cant travel doesnt mean we cant have pictures
the idea of this lands on ryan pretty hard
it was a great idea
ryan is stuck with jim talking real estate
alex is having a chat with the brides maids about local relationship drama
its sixty acres up against the foothills
i subdivided the old lazy w ranch and took a nice slice for myself
jim makes an exhale noise that means you bet your ass
homes will go in the high fours
must be a nice development
its a community not a development
the concept is turn key everything
you buy a maintenance contract with the home
well whack your weeds well even change the light bulb
you buy your own or choose a package
seamless traditionalism yet all the perks
ryan and alex make eye contact
theres a joy in their connection amongst the ramblings of their company
we all need a place to call our own
this is america
this is what we were promised
thats a nice touch
that bit at the end about promise
i like it
a little embarrassed thanks
so you still renting that one bedroom
i gave it up
you own now
but youre looking
the conversation stalls out
everyone is leaving
tammy grabs julies hands
can you believe its tomorrow
how are you going to sleep
i dont know
you want some xanax
i dont think thats for sleeping
no im good
ill have some warm milk
that should do the trick
jim comes walking by with a box of flower arrangements from the tables inside that are going to be reused at the wedding
one more box
ill get it
alex steps back in and for the first time in who knows how many years ryan kara and julie are alone together
jim seems like a good guy
yeah i know
isnt he great
hes going to make a great husband
theres a moment where they just look at each other and giggle a little
just the three of them
hey julie i was thinking
with dad not being
well i didnt know if you had someone to walk you down the aisle
oh yeah jims uncle is going to do it
hes been really supportive
just wanted to make sure you were covered
so i should get there at
guests are arriving around ish
things get going at
so you know around then
just come down the elevator
alex comes out with the second box
ryan notices and grabs the flowers from her and sets them in jims luxury pick up truck
ryan alex and kara arrive at their adjacent rooms
key cards slide in simultaneously
alex heads in
can you believe shes getting married already
shes just a kid
actually shes years old
shes barely squeaking by
the rental car pulls up into the empty lot
snow on the ground
ryan and alex walk up the steps and try the door of the main building its locked
thats all you got
alex starts walking down the side of the building looking for an open window
the third one opens a crack
she slides her hotel honors card in and opens the latch
are we really doing this
give me a boost
alex slowly wedges herself headfirst through the window
ryan climbs in after her
he immediately recognizes his surroundings
i took geography in here
that was my seat
you ever fool around with one of your teachers
not until college
come on show me around
they head for the door
a finger reaches and points to a teenage face
ryan and alex are huddled at the trophy case
you played basketball
dont act so surprised
i didnt know you were such a jock
ryan and alex walk passed a concrete ledge
my first fight
howd it go
got my ass kicked
ryan shows an area behind the stairwell
this is where we used to go to make out
alex and ryan sit tight like teenagers on the team bench
im really happy i came here
the school soccer team takes the field for practice
to the team go cougars
players look back at him strangely
ryans phone rings
checks caller id its kara
the first thing we hear is crying in the background
kara is on her cell phone
behind her in the deep background we see bridesmaids consoling julie
ryan where are you
were having a meltdown here
can you get back here
we need your help
yeah of course
ryans rental car pulls up in front
he hops out and alex takes the drivers seat
ill grab your suit
ryan immediately spots julie sobbing and being consoled by her brides maids
the groomsmen are huddled in another corner embarrassed and confused
kara splits from the brides maids and takes ryan aside
jims got cold feet
thats how cold feet work
what do you want me to do
talk to him
you want me to talk to him
hey its either you or me
you know my record
ive already struck out once
i havent been to bat
i havent been in the dugout
dont you talk for a living
motivational type stuff
i tell people how to avoid commitment
what kind of fucked up message is that
its a philosophy
hey it might have helped you
a beat of stalemate
come on ryan
you havent been around much
fuck you basically dont exist to us
i know you want to be there for her
well here it is
this is your chance
ryan takes a breath
ryan quietly steps in to find jim half dressed in a tux reading the childrens book the velveteen rabbit
ryan goes to leave when
oh hey jim
you ever read this
yeah its pretty powerful stuff
kara mentioned you were having some
jim puts down the book
i dont think i can do this
what makes you say that today
i was just laying there last night in bed and i couldnt sleep
i was thinking about the wedding and the ceremony and all
us buying a house and moving in together
having a kid
having another kid
begins to snowball thanksgiving christmas spring break football games all of a sudden theyre out of school getting jobs getting married and then you know
im a grandparent
before you know it im dead
and i just kept thinking
whats the point
now asking ryan directly i mean what is the point
yeah i mean what am i starting here
its the most beautiful thing on earth
you know what everyone aspires to
you never got married
you never even tried
well its hard to define try
you seem happier than most of my married friends
ryan takes a beat
jim im not going to lie
marriage can be a pain in the ass
and youre kind of right all of this is just stuff on the way to your eventual demise
we are all on running clocks that cannot be slowed down or paused and they all lead to the same place
some guys leave marks that last beyond their own mortality
not guys like you and me
but even those footprints disappear
there isnt a point
jim sinks a little
im not the guy youd normally want to talk to about all this stuff
but think about it your favorite memories
the greatest moments of your life
were you alone
thinks about it no
i guess not
i dont want to sound like a hallmark card but
its better with company
come to think of it
last night the night before your wedding when all this shit was circling through your head
werent you two sleeping in separate rooms
yeah julie went back to the apartment and i was all alone in that big honeymoon suite
jim chuckles to himself
kind of lonely
everybody needs a copilot
this resonates with jim and he cant help but smile
thats a nice touch
whats the mood like out there
its not good
what should i do
twinkle in his eye go get her
jim walks over to the huddle of brides maids
they part and let him in
he kneels at julies feet
im sorry im such a fuck up
will you be my co pilot
julie gives him a perplexed look before smiling and falling into his arms
tears and smiles spread amongst the girls
kara walks over to ryan and pats him on the shoulder
ryan and alex getting dressed in a little kitchen in the church
theyre in a hurry and a little sloppy but theres a crooked joy in their faces
jim standing at the alter with the priest getting a pat on the back from his best man
julie getting walked to the alter by jims uncle
they pass ryan who looks on proudly
the priest gives his blessings
jim raises julies veil
wedding attendees file into the chalet suites banquet hall
ryan and alex mingle with their table
hi im ryan
im your cousin
ryan and alex dance like teenagers
the band does a cheesy choreographed dance step
jim makes a speech
he is not good at public speaking but the guests are generous with laughter
tammy has her tongue down a groomsmens throat
ryan pulls kara onto the dance floor
she rests her head on his shoulder and they slow dance
jim and julie make their farewell and run off
ryan and alex help pick the center pieces off the tables
ryan and alex get into the elevator together
shes wearing his jacket
were about to see them kiss when the elevator door closes
ryan and alex stand between their gates
one sign reads omaha
the other sign reads chicago
when am i going to see you
youre just going to have to come and visit
so settled down
youre not going to change on me
just one address
we hear a boarding announcement for chicago
alex begins to step away to her gate
call me if you get lonely
alex turns for her gate and joins the crowd
ryan goes to say something
he has an impulse
but he finally ignores it and gets in line under the sign that reads omaha
the door opens and ryan wheels in his roll away
he walks over to the window parts the blinds and checks out his awful view
we see ryan opening some mail
we see ryan laying in bed
natalie is giving ryan a tour of the new online firing area a series of cubicles with young guys on headsets
she is in her element and very proud of her work
some guy sits down in a conference room somewhere and a server routes their session to one of our termination engineers
you dont actually call them that
i prefer terminators but it bumped with legal
i cant imagine why
they follow a workflow that can take them through anything from a standard dismissal to a violent aggressor
are they actually on line right now
no theyre beta testing
we go live at the end of the month
catches one of the guys making a mistake kyle youre running through the events too quickly
you have to give them time to acknowledge each statement
its a legal thing
ryan can only watch
ryan is sitting at his desk
he puts on a headset
this is ridiculous
craig is leading a meeting
ryan seems focused on something on his laptop
we see his screen an itinerary for goalquest
one of the giant digital marquees reads goalquest xx ryan sits on a sofa holding his backpack
a slick goalquest host enters the room
you ready to rock
ryan nods and gets up
ryan stands in the wings
he takes a breath then steps out in front of a sea of people
the goalquest xx stage is like nothing weve seen yet
large and professional
blue banners hang from the ceiling
digital projectors show ryans headshot whats in your backpack
ryan sets the back pack on a table and quickly unzips it
last year i flew three hundred fifty thousand miles
the moon is only two fifty
a long beat
ryan looks at the back pack
imagine for a second that youre carrying a backpack
i want you to feel the straps on your shoulders
you feel them
ryan isnt feeling them
he is not inspired
he isnt believable
hes barely even there
now i want you to pack it with all the stuff you have in your life
start with the little things
ryan is trying but he cant find the will to do this
the stuff in drawers and on shelves
ryan takes a beat
he just stares at the backpack and thinks about all the things he has removed from it
and with that ryan leaves the stage
handlers try to figure out what ryan is doing
the host runs for the mic
what the fuck are you doing
okay everyone just relax
well have your next guest out in a sec
ryan hustles past slot machines until he is actually jogging
ryan runs up to a gate
hes the last one to board
over ryans shoulder through the window we see chicago below as the flight begins its descent
ryan on the people mover under the ceiling of neon lights
peaceful music emits from hidden speakers
ryan walks briskly past idle riders
ryan hurriedly signs a hand held device hops into a sedan and speeds off
the rental car assistant suddenly realizes
hey you forgot to give me your devotion club card
ryan steps out of his rental car and approaches the door of the townhouse checking the address against a piece of ryan stops knocks and puts on a smile
we hear footsteps
the door unlocks and opens revealing alex
shes wearing sweatpants and glasses
shes at home
she looks different
but theres something else
alex is in shock
ryans smile begins to melt
a mans voice calls from inside
honey whos at the door
a couple kids run by through the background giggling
a man chases after them
alex is still speechless
her eyes are angry and apologizing all at the same time
ryan just stands there
emotionally bleeding to death
what are you doing here
ryan begins to step away
he turns and heads for his car dropping the flowers
alexs husband becomes visible just as shes shutting the door
who was that
just some guy who was lost
ryan gets in his rental car and drives off
were watching ryan through his window from far away
almost as if looking through binoculars
he sits on his bed tie undone holding a glass with an inch of scotch on his knee
we see quick glimpses of ryan getting ready
crappy little coffee maker crappily brewing
crappy hotel bar of soap crappily lathering
crappy hair dryer crappily blowing
ryan is on the phone with alex
how could you lie to me
alex sits in the car with the engine running
what were you thinking just showing up at my door like that
what do you mean
i wanted to see you
i didnt know you had a family why didnt you tell me that
come on i thought we signed up for the same thing
try to help me understand
what is it you signed up for
i thought our relationship was perfectly clear
a long beat an escape
im an escape
you know a break from our normal lives
im a parenthesis
i cant believe were having this conversation
i mean what do you want
ryan stumbles on this
what does he want
you dont even know what you want
im sorry that i ruined your night
but you could have seriously screwed things up for me
that was my family
thats my real life
i thought i was a part of your real life
im a grown up
i dont hold a grudge
when youre ready to be an adult and see me again just give me a call
ryan cant quite believe what hes hearing
theres only one thing he can do
he hangs up
ryan is walking when his phone buzzes
he checks the display ctc calling
he presses ignore
ryan walks up to the ticket desk
he is more lost than usual
there is something plucky about the ticket agent
welcome back mr
yeah right you got me in c
left side aisle non bulkhead
just like you like it
whats got you so fucking happy
the plucky agent fades a bit then tries to recompose
your boarding card mr
ryan takes the ticket and exits
ryan sits doing nothing
others around him play sudoku read trashy paperbacks work on laptops
ryan just stairs at the stitching on the seat in front of him
bing ladies and gentlemen we have a special announcement to make
passengers look up
our pilot has just informed me that we are passing over the city of mesa
which might not mean much to most of you but means a lot to one of our fliers today because he just hit oh no
the gershwin theme song for the airline rains down from the overhead speakers
flight attendants gather at ryans seat with big smiles and champagne
ryan doesnt even react
hes just stunned
the flight attendants separate just enough for a man in a bomber jacket to squeeze through
its maynard finch the chief pilot from the commercial
that seat taken
maynard gives a little salute to his flight attendants then slides by ryan to the window seat
youre the youngest yet to hit twenty mil
dont know where you found the time
oh right here you go
maynard pulls out a membership card
its actually been stamped from platinum
seventh card weve made
we really appreciate your loyalty
it has a pair of wings around member number
ryan holds it between his fingertips
catches his own reflection
you know how many times ive thought about this moment
played out the conversation id have with you right here
what did you want to say
a long beat
you know i
i cant remember
happens to all of us
attempts chit chat so where you from
ryan looks at him straight in the face
im from here
ryan picks up the phone at his desk
he removes his new ten million mile card and dials a number off the back
oh how did you know it was me
this is your dedicated line
we reserve them for our most loyal and dedicated fliers
id like to transfer some of my miles
can you open up an account under jim and julie miller
how many miles would you like to transfer
how many miles would it take to circle the globe
we have our around the world tickets
theyre five hundred thousand miles each
craig enters ryans doorway
got a second
to the airline operator im going to have to call you right back
craig takes a seat across from ryan
what happened to you yesterday
i was trying to reach you all day
i got tied up in
whats going on
an uncomfortable beat
do you remember karen barnes
she was part of a thirty person reduction a few weeks back in wichita
natalie fired her
no i fire dozens of people a day
she killed herself
jumped off a bridge
do you remember anyone giving you any signals of anything
theyre all depressed
were firing them
hey look you know i have to ask
no i dont remember anything
of course theyre upset
you never think that
wasnt any woman who gave you any indication
ryan remembers her
no nothing that stands out
is natalie alright
is she coming in
ryan isnt surprised
just like that
ryan stifles a laugh
yeah real fucking nice right
no one has manners anymore
she say where she was going
she was pretty upset
i should give her a call
i need you back in the air
ryan doesnt react
did you hear me
i thought youd be thrilled
what about video conferencing
ctc is pausing on the whole new media front for a moment
giving it a little more thought
getting our work horses back out doing what they do best
how long are you sending me out
were going to let you sail and sail
send us a postcard if you ever get there
ryan absorbs this
a management level guy sits at his desk
bay area sports paraphernalia on the wall
so what happened
we turn to reveal natalie
how exactly do you mean
you graduated top of your class
you seemed to have your pick of employment
including right here
instead you went to omaha
to fire people for a living
its challenging work
i cant imagine doing that day in day out
not in this climate
after a beat i followed a boy
the manager smiles to himself
everybody does at one point or another
the manager raises a letter its ryans letter
this guy says id be lucky to have you
ryan writing the letter
we hear what hes writing
to whom it may concern i cant even count the number of people ive fired in my lifetime
so many that ive forgotten what its like to actually hire somebody
weve never met but i know youd be lucky to have natalie keener
take her and dont look back
shell be the best decision youve made in a long time
the manager puts down the letter and reaches out a hand
hope hes right
natalie breaks into a smile then jumps back to professional
ryan steps out his front door roll away in tow
ryan walks through the automated door
he looks like he did in the opening of the film
maybe even wearing the same clothes
something is different though
tonight most people will be welcomed home by jumping dogs and squealing kids
their spouses will ask about their day and tonight theyll sleep
ryan stops and looks up at a giant board of destinations
an endless list of cities around the world
a menu of new lives departing every five minutes
the stars will wheel forth from their daytime hiding places
we look back at ryan
his eyes lock on one of the cities
we dont see which one
he makes a mental decision and turns in the direction of the gate
he lets go of his roll away
and one of those lights slightly brighter than the rest will be my wingtip passing over blessing them
ryan takes a step but before his foot can land we
