by steve koren mark okeefe rewrite by steve oedekerk shady acres entertainment a news crew shuttles around a gigantic cookie
standing by are the kowolski brothers gustov and vol two short stocky men along with mother kowolski and other bakery family employees
a year anniversary sign hangs in the background
bruce nolan looks into a make up mirror desperately trying to place a large segment of wayward hair
oh god no
the hairs wrong
this is a bad sign
calling out we really need to get a make up person
the segment producer ally loman steps over
not in the budget
and not to worry youre going to look great in this
she holds out a hair net
a hair net
im not wearing a hair net
i just did the hair
matter of fact health code
in the kitchen or around the cookie you gotta have it
to crew re hair net you guys should tell me this before hand this is like a huge waste of
bruce spreads the hair net bends down out of frame comes up looking ridiculous and very disgruntled
remind me to swing by an elementary school after this and serve lunch
youre a thing of beauty
in three two one
bruce snaps from pissed to instant charismatic tv newsman
note whenever bruce speaks on camera he speaks in his reporters voice that recognizable too smooth delivery that all news reporters seem to have
in mathematical terms bruces version is to the th power
for three decades the kowolski family bakery has been a mainstay in downtown buffalo
known for their sinfully rich cream filled deep fried polski pierogis
and the occasional sugar induced coma that follows
today in honor of their year anniversary momma kowolski and her sons gustov and vol decided to do something a little bit different
tell me guys how did this idea come about
well vol said to me gustov why dont we make the biggest chocolate chip cookie in buffalo
and i said yeah sure
bruce steps up to the huge cookie
the previous buffalo cookie record was feet inches baked by gladys pelsnick
but this behemoth cookie clearly proving that gustov and vol have much more free time
the kowolski brothers and all celebrate in the background toasting with big mugs of milk
bruce steps forward looks dramatically at camera slow zoom in as he speaks
as we witness the ceremonial toasting with milk it makes one pause and think
what are we really looking at here
is it just a big cookie or does this cookie represent the pride of buffalo
our dedicated and hard working citizens the key ingredient with a few nuts thrown in
motions his eyes to the kowolski twins and finally the love of our families which provides the warm chewy center making our beloved buffalo the sweetest place to live
camera is in close as bruce signs off
and thats the way the cookie crumbles
im bruce nolan eyewitness news
bruces hair net slips up puffing his hair into a bun on the top of his head
the kowolskis and bystanders all laugh
the frame freezes
we pull back from the tv and find bruce holding the remote watching the recorded spot on tv
we are now
bruce is with his longtime girlfriend grace
she has a box of photos on the coffee table in front of her organizing them into a photo album
so what do you think
its a story about a cookie
people with eating disorders will be riveted goes into huge pathetic fan character dear bruce love the bakery piece
i cant wait to vomit so i can make room for more cookies
i thought it was funny
i love the hair net

i dont even look like myself
the hair is one of the most important parts of an on camera persona
right out of the gate i lost the hair advantage
grace looks at a photo oh my gosh look at this one

she places it in the album
try to stay focused here
i need your help
arent you taking this a little too seriously

theres an anchor job open
this is important

bruce points to the tv as he says future not realizing hes pointing at the ridiculous image of himself with the hair net bun
grace cant help but giggle
bruce collapses into graces arms like a child
he clearly has a fragile temperament
sighs im never going to get anchor doing these kind of assignments
i want my work to matter
it does matter
you make people smile

grace holds up a photo
oh look at this

grace cuddles into bruce
so youre attracted to me in some way is that what youre trying to say
grace rolls over onto bruce
you have no idea
i was saving myself for the wedding night but if you keep this up i may lose my resolve
grace stands pulling bruce up
well thats the way the cookie crumbles
they kiss stumbling toward the bedroom
hey thats a good line but you need more resonance
from the diaphragm
newscaster voice thats the way the cookie crumbles
oh say it again
bigger thats the way the cookie crumbles
sweet southern groupie oh i just love on air personalities
newscaster voice well then let me take these clothes off and slip into my hair net
grace laughs bruce joins in as they disappear into the bedroom
we see the intro for sixty minutes im ed bradley im merely safer an d i m leslie stahl is hit in the neck with a tranquilizer dart
her head wavers then drops on the desk
the camera pans to bruce who lowers a bamboo blow gun cooly addresses camera
and this is sixty minutes
we are in
bruce lies next to grace with a big smile on his face
grace hits the alarm rolls over snuggling close to bruce
sweety time to get up
she kisses bruce gets up
no im having a great dream
the covers are ripped out of frame
bruce throws a mock hissy fit
bruce watches tv as he buttons his shirt
and the sabers lost another close one last night
four to three to the toronto maple leafs
of course they lost theyre my team
bruce checks his hair in the mirror practicing his new sign off
and thats the way the cookie crumbles
calls to grace you know i think there might be something to that cookie line
everything great anchor has his own signature sign off
as walter cronkite and thats the way the cookie crumbles
peeing in the corner on the carpet
grace the dog
im in the shower
bruce runs along carrying the peeing sam with extended arms dodges a man ascending the stares who gets sprinkled
bruce makes it outside sets sam down on the grass
sam looks up innocently at bruce finished
oh youre all done huh
b e a utiful
bruce pulls up in his ford tauras to a cluster of cars unloading kids
a mercedes srl passes by
wow nice car huh
yeah if you want to rub your success in peoples faces
then bruce notices a big medical van in front of the school with a blood drive sign
whats with the hubbub

oh thats a nice response
i mean its just s o
helpful and life saving

grace sighs in exasperation starts out when
suddenly remembers something she places a string of prayer beads on the rearview mirror
the kids made em
keep you safe
well i hope they work cause its going take a miracle to get me to work on time
bruce is stuck in bumper to bumper traffic
he stares at the prayer beads with a thanks alot look
a big accident ahead
bruce looks at his watch hes screwed
a person is carried by on a stretcher bruce is oblivious
this is just my luck
bruces beeper sounds
he checks it
the meetings starting perfect
thinks screw it
he looks to the right of the car in front of him then peels off onto the shoulder passing tons of cars
laughs catch you later lemmings its kill or be killed only the strong survive no guts no glory bruce pulls over fumes
looking heavenward thank you
bruce screeches into a space races out of the car bumping over a trash can goes back to pick it up sees a homeless man who sits peacefully next to
a paint bucket and sign boards
the various warnings change daily
todays sign reads bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat then continues on
bruce rushes through the newsroom rounds a corner and runs right into bobby the endlessly yammering pastry cart guy
bruce the goose
dont even move i got somethin special today
my mom made it just for you
well thats bobby i gotta go im late
bending down you like quiche
he comes back up proudly presents a slice of quiche
you know contrary to popular belief the quiche was actually invented by the mayans then stolen by the french
they shoulda said hey that quiche aint yours its mayan
bobby belts out a laugh
bobby i cant i just taste it taste it
bobby shoves a bite into bruces mouth
bruce feigns liking it with exasperation
mmm delicious i really gotta go

bruce tosses the thought digs into his pocket fishing for cash
excited oh two oclock two oclock two o five two ten
bruce glances over annoyed but freezes at the sight of sexy anchorwoman susan ortega across the room
way out of our league huh
bruce offers his money to bobby
you know i saw them editing your cookie piece
they must have gotten high or something cause they was orderin everything i had
hey how long have you been interested in pastry

bruce tosses the money on the cart heads off

bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat then continues on
the morning meeting is well in progress
leading the group is the station manager and bruces boss jack keller s a constant furrow in his brow
also in the room bruces fellow field reporter and rival evan baxter s a walking statement
impeccable posture perfect speech perfect everything and he knows it
fred donohue the ever jovial sports reporter always tanned vain weatherman dallas coleman and segment producer ally loman
okay promos are approved lets ah isnt that last one a little misleading

jack shouldnt the promos be focusing on petes retirement

bruce bursts into the room
the meeting stops
jack doesnt need to say anything he just looks at his watch
it wasnt my fault
the traffic was you guys already played the spots
nice story bruce but were going with evans piece on the sex scandal at the mayors office for sweeps
this hits bruce hard
a beat of silence
and thats the way the cookie crumbles
the others chuckle
only ally remains sympathetic
im just messin with you bruce
see youve got to remember that the news room is like a cookie
re evans perfect posture thats great evan
bruce contd is youre posture naturally that good or do you have to shove a stick up there
okay knock it off
bruce were holding your story in reserve
now can we get back to the board so we have something to air today
jack continues with assignments
evan sits smugly as bruce slides down into his chair deflated
jack is at bobbys cart paying for a sandwich
bruce catches up
jack jack hey

what do you need
jack takes his sandwich and leaves
bobby leans to bruce
dont worry about it
i called my aunt were on
bruce looks at bobby continues after and catches jack

the point is ive hit some kind of a ceiling here
some kind of anti bruce barrieri and evan is just lovin it by the way
he gets the good stories he gets on sweeps
maybe i have to be more like evan
you dont want to be like evan
evans an asshole
i can be an asshole
bruce thinks then flips jacks sandwich plate over
it scatters on the floor
jack and bruce stare at each other for a beat

yeah im sorry
bruce bends down starts picking up jacks food
its just this anchor position looming its gotten me nuts
he hands the plate to jack as sexy anchorwoman susan ortega saunters by
bruce blanches at this obvious snubbing

we hear childrens joyous shrieks
a couple dozen kids playing at graces self starter business a one room day care center filled with children and toys
grace turns reacts

he shakes his head no

abra su boca
his tongue sparkles with glitter
oh youre not huh

graces sister debbie enters
shes wearing a nurses outfit
her youngest zoe runs over to greet her

well it seemed like they were speaking a foreign language sometimes but no
martin has decided to explore new food groups
back to martin martin this is for art
she spreads paste on the paper sprinkles glitter

d eb ma rt i n
martin is busted with the paste spreader stuck in his mouth
grace snatches it

bruce is on his cell phone while the news crew races around setting up for the report
the falls roar behind him and the mate of the mist sightseeing boat is in the b
cheery no its debbie

grace grabs the phone
feigns innocent what

bruce contd theyre seeing if i can think on my feet like you might have to do in a live news anchor situation
oh my gosh
this is happening for us grace
what weve always talked about
jack practically came out and told me
grace quickly switches gears
she experienced the premature celebration before
wait what do you mean practically
well he didnt spell it out but this is exactly what happened to susan ortega right before she was bumped up to the desk
being cautious i just want to make sure were not getting too ahead of ourselves
i totally agree but in the mean time you should start thinking about what coast you want to live on
ally interrupts indicating the time
oh theyre calling me i gotta go
good luck honey
i love you
i love you
hangs up debbie turns to grace
ally hustles bruce toward the bow of the boat as he places his ear piece
they want you close to the falls
ill get soaked
thats the point
they want you to hold up this
she hands bruce a very stupid looking blue falls shaped umbrella with the maid of the mist insignia
part of the condition of us getting the exclusive
bruce takes the umbrella
glad i wore my tap shoes
remember this is their rd anniversary
they cater to tourists honeymooners
and people who are insanely thirsty i get it
and youll be interviewing irene dansfeild
she positions a very very old woman next to bruce
she rode on the maiden voyage with her late husband
bruce looks upward at the ridiculous umbrella
mutters encouragement to himself
seconds going live
think anchor think dignity glances up toward umbrella ignore umbrella
just have fun
some of the crew members watch the feed
pete fineman is reporting
but because of the fast response by our local fire fighters the toxic chemicals were cleaned up without incident
the female co anchor susan ortega bruce nolan is standing by at niagara falls with a report on the maid of the mist sightseeing boat but before we go live
to bruce we have an announcement to make
as everyone knows after years our beloved pete fineman is retiring
pete smiles a proud heart felt smile
petes shoes are virtually impossible to fill but the show must go on
and we could think of no one better than our very own evan baxter
listening to the feed
his face goes white
he stands in shock
evan is seated next to susan
looks like well be sitting side by side from now on
i m thrilled and honored
like you said no one can replace the great pete fineman but ill do my best
i have to say i am so proud to be a part of our local community
i think a great city is a lot like a great recipe really
put in some hard working citizens add some care givers maybe a few nuts
the other news anchors and evan himself chuckle at his joke
bruce listens on the feed beyond stunned
all sprinkled with the strength and love of our good families that ultimately creates a sweet place to live
that was amazing
and now lets go live to wacky bruce nolan out at niagara falls
bruce stands like a deer in headlights drenched holding the ridiculous umbrella
ally sig nals bruce hes on
he stares into camera numb
the kids are gone
grace watches the tv with a few other teachers
talk honey talk
jack rushes in looking at bruce on the monitor
whats going on
weve got a walt disney
he may not have audio
check his feed have susan cover
susan reacts to the message in her ear piece
we may be having a bit of technical difficulty
evan smiles in the background clearly enjoying himself
feeds good jack
come on bruce talk damn it
okay get ready to pull the plug
please baby say something
like popping out of a coma bruce surges in
surprisingly seems very up and fine
thank you susan bruce nolan here aboard the maid of the mist at niagara falls
thank you god
sighs relief thank god
jack pats the directors shoulder heads out of the room
first off i want to add another congratulations to evan baxter
its good to see what someone with real talent can accomplish when great opportunities are given to him instead of me
still smiling anyway im here i believe with katherine hepburns mom
tell me why did you toss the blue heart of the ocean jewel over the railing of titanic
the old woman doesnt know what to say
did you feel guilty at all letting leonardo decaprio freeze while you were safe floating on the big door
do you think he would have survived if you had taken turns or were you too afraid to freeze your big fat ass off
jack rockets back into the room
did i just hear
well i guess thats the way life works isnt it
some people are drenched freezing to death on a stupid boat with a stupid umbrella
heaves the umbrella while others who arent fit to kiss my willy are sitting in a nice comfy news room sucking up all the glory
this isnt happening
this isnt happening
bruce takes off walking the camera follows
now lets speak to the owner
come on in here bill
bill shakes his head no as bruce pulls him into frame
ve been running the maid of the mist for years
tell me why do you think i didnt get the anchor job
hey man i dont want any do you think its my hair
bruce messes his hair like crazy maybe my teeth arent white enough
or like the great falls is the bedrock of my life slowly erroding underneath me
moving closer to camera to an inch away erroding
all work has stopped
stunned staffers stare at the monitor
jack stands with his jaw dropped snaps out of it
alright cut the feed
cut to black if you have to
im on it
bruce is now licking the camera lens
he steps back and signs off
smooth as silk
im bruce nolan for eyewitness news
back to you fuckers susan ortega stares frozen blankly into camera
bruce is tossed out the front doors his box of possessions spilling on the ground
bruce flails at the building
bruce carries his box to his car when he hears a noise
a street gang is hassling the homeless sign guy
pushing him around breaking and painting over his signs
instinctively bruce walks over
hey come on guys
what are you doin
just leave him alone
they turn look at bruce laugh and head off
bruce helps the sign guy up looks after the gang
yeah youd better keep walkin
they stop cold turn back to bruce and charge at him
bruce attempts to run but they leap on him in a big dog pile swinging and kicking
bruce is left with a bloody lip lying beside his car
we hear the sound of smashing glass and scratching metal and the gang running off
bruce slowly gets up
reveal bruces car windows smashed paint scraped and the word hero key scratched on the door
b e a utiful
bruce contd just what you get for trying to help someone
bruce gets in pulls out of the parking lot passing the homeless man who sits beaten up holding a scrawled out sign get a clue buddy
bruce is pacing holding an ice pack to his swollen lip
thank god youre alright
lets thank god
thanks for everything lord
i am so honored that my horrible demise is a part of your loving and mysterious plan
bruce dont talk like that
oh dont worry hes not listening
if he is he doesnt care

what kind of god lets that happen
every time we cure a disease he comes up with a new one

i think its time to release the tainted monkey
oh and theres a guy in ohio whos praying for strength and wisdom blind him and cut off his legs
so god is torturing us

god is all powerful
he could fix everything in five minutes if he wanted to
bruce contd but he doesnt want to
he doesnt like me
sam starts peeing on the rug
to the dog but youre aim isnt so good im over herel bruce please
this isnt his fault
of course not
hushed tone its part of the mysterious plan
grace puts sam outside
returns trying to calm bruce
honey youre mad right now
and what evan did was slimy and wrong
but your job doesnt matter to me
you matter to me
you couldve really been hurt
im just glad youre okay
news flash im not okayi and im not okay with the fact that you think everything is okay
im not okay with a mediocre job
im not okay with a mediocre apartment
im not okay with a mediocre life
bruce angrily swipes at the table knocking the photos and the photo albums to floor
is that what you have bruce
a mediocre life
well im sorry for being a piece in your mediocre puzzle
im drowning and you throw me a brick
grace starts to cry
ill have the worst day of my life with a side order of guilt please
i i dont need this
bruce grabs his keys and heads out
its raining now
bruce drives going nowhere in particular
his frustration is turning to desperation
you want me to talk to you
then talk back
tell me whats going on
what should i do
give me a sign
bruce passes a blinking yellow caution light doesnt notice
im right here
speak to me
a pedestrian stepping into the crosswalk steps back out of the way
bruce is oblivious
all i need is some guidance
please send me a signal
a truck transporting various road signs pulls in front of br uce
f our way s bli nki ng
the va rie d s igns re ad yi eld wrong way dead end do not enter stop
oh well i guess you dont care
bruce spots the prayer beads hanging on the rearview mirror
okay well do it your way
pulls the beads from the mirror lord i need a miracle
please help me
he hits a bump and the beads drop to the floor
bruce reaches down fishes for the beads
come on whered you go
holds them up in triumph ah ha
bruces car slams into a light post
bruce stumbles out surveys his demolished car then looks at the beads in his hands
he begins to laugh maniacally
he spots the lake starts running toward it like a madman heaves the prayer beads into the lake
he looks heavenward challenging the infinite
okay if thats the way you want it
the gloves are off pal
let me see a little wrath
smite me oh mighty smiteri what no pestilence no boils
come on you got me on the ropes dont you want to finish me off
youre the one who should be fired
the only one around here not doing his job is you
what are we youre little pet project
a hobby you tinker with now and again
a beat of silence then bruces beeper goes off
he cynically chuckles at the timing checks it sees
sorry dont know you wouldnt call you if i did
bruce walks off toward his wrecked car it beeps again
the beeping continues
we are in
bruce wakes slaps at the alarm clock groggy reaches for the phone finally realizes its the beeper
he gets up begrudgingly checks it
the same number
well hello again dont hold your breath
bruce tosses the pager on the bed heads for the bathroom
the beeper beeps
bruce stops in his tracks turns opens the window grabs the beeper and fires it out
it shatters against a telephone pole
he calmly continues to the bathroom
a note is stuck in the bathroom mirror with an old picture of he and grace in happier times
the note simply says grace peering over top of the note bruce sees sam circling on the rug
bruce runs down the stairs carrying the trickling sam
bruce sets sam on the grass
sam looks up finished
whats the point
bruce walks over to the shattered beeper
he picks up a small piece of it containing the led read out
denied that promotion at work
is life unfair
everywhere you turn is there someone less talented than you reaping all the benefits
is your name bruce
then do we have the job for you
were located at rd street
bruce reaches for a pen begins jotting down the address
so come on down or well just keep beepin ya
an old building on the outskirts of town
a faded sign painted on the wall reads omni presents
bruces demolished car enters frame
he studies the area and building suspiciously
bruce cautiously moves towards the structure and then steps in a puddle
he sinks up to his knee
he gets out shakes off his sopping leg and heads inside
bruce enters and checks the building directory
it reads pers onnel rm
ac coun ting rm
creativ e rm
youre looking for room
bruce turns to see a janitor mopping the floor
he looks at bruces wet leg offers the mop
want me to even those up for you
feigns a smile how would i get to room
thatd be on the seventh floor
stairs are right over there
what about the elevator
he points to an elevator bank a couple of steps away
out of order
bruce heads for the stairs
you mind giving me a hand with this floor
yeah i mind
he continues on
the stairwell door opens up to a large room with a single desk at the end of an otherwise empty space
bruce hears someone tinkering atop a tall ladder extending into a hole in the ceiling
im ah looking for whoever runs this joint
be right with y
a just fixin a light
tell me if its working
click and an insanely bright white light illuminates shining down blinding bruce
yep seems to be
wiping his eyes kinda bright though
an electrician silhouetted in the bright light descends the ladder
yeah it is for most people
they spend their lives in the dark
as he talks he steps down next to bruce and we see that it is the same janitor
thinkin they can hide from me
the two stand angelically illuminated
bruce tries to put everything together
oh the elevators broken huh
yeah but ill get around to it
the janitor claps his hands twice and the light goes off
you installed a clapper
catchy jingle though
sings claps twice you cant get it out of your head
i gotta go
okay but the boss be right out
the janitor unzips his uniform revealing a very nice suit
he extends his hand to bruce
you must be bruce
ive been expecting you
oh this is hilarious
so youre the boss and the electrician and the janitor
nothin wrong with rollin up your sleeves son
people underestimate the benefits of good ol manual labor
theres freedom in it
happiest people in the world stink like hell at the end of the day
he strolls down the room takes a seat behind the big desk
your father knew that
he was a damn good welder
bruce approaches the desk
how do you know my father
and how did you get my pager number
oh i know a lot about you bruce
pretty much everything there is to know
everything youve ever said done or thought about doin is right there in that file cabinet
he points out a single drawer file cabinet
sarcastic wow a whole drawer
just for me
mind if i take a look
its your life
bruce pulls the drawer and it flies open dragging him the the janitor casually pulls a file
now this last entry was a little disturbing
he thumps the file cabinet with his fist and the drawer dramatically sucks closed dragging bruce back
the janitor reads from the file
reads scanning thanks for everything lord
janitor contd i am so honored that my horrible demise is a part of your loving and mysterious plan
the gloves are off pal
smite me oh mighty smiter
aside im not much for blaspheming but that one made me laugh
oh and lets not forget what kind of a god would let this happen
i mean have you seen then news lately
bruce stands dazed
who are you
im the creator of the heavens and the earth
im the alpha omega
the first and the last
sorry its not ringing a bell
im god bruce
oh youre god
well that explains everything thats how you know everything about me
thats how you got up to the seventh floor so quickly
placating well its really nice to meet you
thanks for the grand canyon and ah good luck with the apocalypse
bruce turns to leave but finds himself walking right toward god and his desk
he tries again and again
okay i dont know how youre doing that but i really gotta go
this place is obviously rigged in some way
were on some freaky hidden camera show
playing to the cameras for which i will not sign a release by the way
but you know what id be a little more impressed if you didnt use the cheesy file cabinet illusion
bruce contd everyone with a brain in their head would know that the drawer is being fed through the wall from behind bruce pulls the file cabinet from the wall
sees it has a normal back
thats a good one
bruce quickly puts his hands behind his back
how many fingers am i holding out
bruce extends three fingers
he quickly pulls one finger in
bruce begins switching fingers rapidly
god doesnt miss a beat
one final attempt bruce holds seven fingers
okay how about now
he quickly pulls in two fingers
ah hal bruce proudly presents his single hand of five extended fingers to god then immediately notices he has seven fingers aaahhhl he shakes his fingers wildly and the two
extra fingers disappear
god approaches bruce
youve been doing a lot of complaining about me bruce
and quite frankly im tired of it
bruce backs away from god
you stay away from me
i dont know what your doing
but whatever youre doing is probably actionable
well thats not very neighborly
i brought you here to offer you a job
wh at job
you think you can do it better so heres your chance
when you leave this building you will be endowed with all my powers
sure whatever you say pal
he turns to go but god stands before him in the janitor uniform holding the mop
all the power of god
bruce glances back at the empty desk turns back again and god the janitor has also vanished
a beat then bruce sprints out of the room
bruce barrels out of the building okay that did not happen
he races to his car stepping in the same puddle but this time his foot doesnt sink he walks right across it
he paus es f or a bea t
he races on
bruce jumps in turns the key the car turns over but doesnt start
im having a breakdown
thats what it is
just a normal everyday psychotic episode brought on by tumor or brain lesion
we hear the car wind down to nothing
bruce releases the key pounds the steering wheel in frustration
to the car come on starti the car instantly starts
denial well that was lucky
bruce backs up peels out
bruce drives whistling the tune catches himself immediately stops whistling
okay just relax here
i did not meet god and i do not have his powers
laughs if that was god then im mario andretti
instantly bruces car peels out races through traffic dodging and passing cars right and left
suddenly there is a guy in a red pit crew suit standing before bruce waving a red flag
bruce swerves to avoid the man and screeches into a pit stop
several other red suited italian men engulf the car
bruce watches in amazement as the professional racing team jacks up his car slaps on huge mag tires gases him up etc
paul newman leans into the drivers window
hey mario did you get that box of dressing i sent you
bruce responds against his will in perfect italian in perfect italian si dovete venire sopra per il pranzo un certo tempo
subtitles yes you must come over for dinner some time
bruce reacts shocked
the crew backs off and urges him on in italian
vete l ve tel bruces car peels out on its own he struggles to control the wheel finally pulling over to a curb
his car door wont open so he has to crawl out of the drivers window
he rushes onto the sidewalk backing away from his normal looking tauras
not knowing what to do he slips into a diner
bruce quickly walks to a back corner booth
the only other patron is an old man seated at the counter
it isnt real it isnt real it isnt real
sally kirkland type waitress order pad in hand stands listening to bruce with a raised eyebrow
oh hi ah coffee please
the waitress pours him a cup
weve got a special on soup today
no thats okay
she heads off
bruce sits thinking
could it be real
he looks at the sugar down at the end of the table holds out his hand and the sugar slides across the table right into his hand
the creamer slides into his other hand
bruce is half scared half thrilled
he pours some cream and sugar into his cup looks around the table
excuse me i need a spoooo
bruce chokes up a spoon into his hands wipes it off with his napkin
thats alright i found one
the old man eyes bruce suspiciously gets up and moves further down the counter
the waitress sets down the soup heads off then turns back
i lie to my sister
becoming emotional and im sleeping with my best friends husband
i know hes just using me but
im just so tired of being alone
i dont know why im telling you all this
just seems like youd understand
sets the check down take care of that whenever youre ready
bruce looks at the soup
his look grows intense
he slowly raises his hands over the soup bowl
the front door blows open as a wind swirls through the diner and with all the flourish of moses at the red sea bruce a little cockroach scurries across the
table climbs up the edge of the bowl and walks through to the other side
bruce is startled and the soup splashes back to normal collapsing on the cockroach
he looks up at god standing beside the booth
bruce is now awestruck
you he thy
lets take a walk
god leans down lets the little soup covered cockroach go
god and bruce then walk along the lake shore
re the cockroach most people want to kill these guys
im quite fond of em
very streamlined design
like little armored tanks
yknow they can hold their breath for forty minutes and their cells divide only once per molting cycle creating a cytoskeleton with cell adhesion that
catching himself oh this is a bit over your head isnt it
off bruces look
okay let me explain the rules
yeah you left in such a rush i didnt get a chance to explain
well the two extra fingers freaked me out a little bit
laughs i figured that would get your attention
i did the same thing to ghandi he couldnt eat for three weeks
now heres the deal
you have all my power
use it any way you choose
there are only two rules
you cant tell anyone youre god
believe me you dont want that kind of attention
and you cant mess with free will
can i ask why
excited yes you can
thats the beauty it
suddenly a large sailboat sail passes right by them
bruce looks to the sail oddly then
wide angle reveal god and bruce are now walking on the lake about feet from the shore
they watch the sailboat pass
bruce is awestruck
this is amazing
oh speaking of amazing
god dips his hand in the lake and pulls out the prayer beads
he pockets them as he talks
since youre finished with these i think ill hang to em
might come in handy someday
god and bruce are tiny figures on the river as god begins to walk away
ill be seein ya
where are you going
im taking a vacation
god cant take a vacation
ever hear of the dark ages
besides im covered
you can fix everything in five minutes if you want to right
left alone bruce begins to carefully tip toe back to shore progresses to a full sprint
grace and debbie stand at the check out stand
grace flips through a celeb magazine as debbie places the last few items from the cart to the conveyor belt
in the background throughout debbies daughter zoe is grabbing random items off the shelves and placing them on the belt
re magazine gosh this girl is so talented and all they ever talk about is her hair
yeah she should marry somebody famous take the focus off
grace checks her cell phone screen
we would have heard it ring
its just that he usually calls during the day
he just needs to blow off some steam hell be fine
i hope so
ive never seen him that mad
an d i lashed back wow you lashed
you never lash
i feel bad for him
hes wanted anchor for so long
zoe begins pulling groups of items onto the belt
well ive been praying to win the lottery for fifteen years but its not going to happen
you know its not all about money
the clerk finishes ringing the last item
thatll be four hundred and twenty seven eighty
debbie looks in a bag pulls out a handful of various counter items
zoe giggles and proudly holds up one of the hundred or so tic tac mint containers
debbie contd hang on i might need you to un check a few things
the people in line hem and haw exasperated
come on lady
snaps hey everybody back off i zoe laughs enjoying the commotion
listen i better get back
i want to be there for him
youre a saint grace
what can i say i love him
and if i know bruce hes out there wandering around with the weight of the world on his shoulders
bruce struts down the street the embodiment of confidence
he turns shooting a finger at a fire hydrant it blasts water
kids run off their front steps start playing
a pretty girl in a dress comes walking toward him
as she passes he blows a little air out of the corner of his mouth and turns to watch her skirt fly up
and he saw that it was good
he spots a mannequin in a store window display wearing a cool casu al outfit
he closes his eyes
when he opens them hes wearing the cool new outfit and the mannequin is dressed in his clothes
he checks his reflection
bruce rounds the corner sees the same gang that beat him up hanging out in the alley
b e a utifull
bruce approaches the gang
hey guys remember me
the gang members turn to bruce
oh look its the hero
hungry for another can of whoop ass
your stereo sounds great in my car man
he and a couple other gang members laugh and high five
look i dont want to fight you guys
so as soon as you apologize ill be on my way
a beat then the hoods burst out laughing
a few circle behind surrounding bruce
the day a monkey climbs out of my butt
what a coincidence
the hood gets a pained look starts gyrating around then a monkey comes climbing out the back of his baggy pants
the big guy looks at hood
did that come out of your butt man
hood faints from shock
now im going to have to teach the rest of you guys a lesson
yeah you and whose army
another bruce steps out from behind a stack of crates
and me and me and me me me me me and me and me
as bruce talks duplicate bruces begin popping out from various spots a doorway hanging down from a fire escape a dumpster pops open six bruces jump out
hood is instantly tackled by three bruges one bruce kneels down behind a hood another bruce pushes him down over his back
the two bruces high five a hood climbs a fire escape
one bruce gives a hand up to another bruce who takes pursuit
another bruce leans out of a window smashes a potted plant over his head our bruce stands in the middle of the action happily watching the mayhem
lets get out of here manl hood takes off running the gang members follow
okay guys kum ba yal the bruces jog over leaping and diving into bruces body
ill take it from here
bruce takes a deep breath opens his mouth wide releasing a
the gang streams out of the alley screaming covered in bruce exits the alley the monkey at his side
he looks down to the monkey
back home for you little one
the monkey takes off back into the alley as we see hood stumbling to his feet
noi nooooo he takes off running the monkey in hot pursuit
he belches and one last locust flies out
he reacts to the unpleasant aftertaste and walks off
we widen to an up angle of him standing on the top of buffalos tallest skyscraper
clouds swirl behind him
he looks out over the vast city lights opens his arms and proclaims to the world
bruce poses in dramatic god like form lightning crashes behind him
he is an awesome god
grace sits on the floor next to the coffee table with a box of photos working on the album
she takes a sip of wine sets down the glass
sam walks over and laps up the wine
to sam well at least i have someone to drink with
grace hears bruce coming up the stairs singing
what if god was one of us
just a slob like one of us
just a stranger on a bus
trying to make his way
grace reacts a bit surprised by bruces happy tone she gets up opens the door and there stands bruce beaming smile holding a very unique bouquet of flowers
finishing song home
re the flowers oh my god
you can call me bruce
where have you been
who wouldnt be on a night like this
holding out the flowers for you
grace takes the flowers gives bruce a kiss still sizing up his mood
these are amazing
what are they
its a totally new breed
a cross pollination between tulips and daisies
i call them todayzees
grace goes to put them in water
bruce is there something youre not telling me
nothing of this world
what do you mean why
last night you werent exactly happy with life
last night i was only human
bruce backs out of the kitchen seductively
bruce breezes through casually instructs the stereo as he passes
the stereo illuminates and barry white music plays
bruce opens the doors steps onto the balcony
he surveys the cloudy sky reaches up with his hand and erases the still not completely satisfied he reaches up toward the moon and makes a lassoing motion then begins
earth far off in the distance and with a thunderous rumble the moon starts moving closer to earth
bruce adds a finishing touch by adding several stars with points of his finger
grace joins bruce on the balcony and is taken aback by the perfectly orchestrated sky
wow it really cleared up
ive never seen the moon that big
bruce puts his arms around grace from behind
we shouldnt waste it
bruce starts kissing her neck
they kiss and a meteor shower lights the sky behind them
the kiss ends
grace grabs a neglige from the drawer heads into the bathroom
bruce enters adjusts the ambience of the room blows the lights out with a quick puff of air lights candles with a gesture
his clothes magically fall away
grace slips her neglige on begins brushing her hair
i be out in a minute
dont rush yourself
sometimes anticipation can heighten the pleasure
grace shudders a bit at the word pleasure quickly finishes brushing picks up her lipstick
its a funny thing about pleasure
graces knees buckle causing the lipstick to smear across her face
she sits down on the toilet seat to get a hold of herself
it can be extremely pleasurable
grace has a very powerful orgasm and slides off the toilet out of frame to the ground
out of control oh oh
standing at the door with both arms extended toward the bathroom like an warlock casting a spell
suddenly the light hits him from the open bathroom door and he quickly strikes a casual pose
grace stands in the open doorway panting like an animal
she dives on bruce attacking him
in international news japanese relief workers are staging a desperate effort to rescue hundreds of people stranded by a freak tidal wave that hit kitamoto city
we see remote footage of japanese families being airlifted from root tops
scientists say the tsunami may have been caused by what theyre describing as unusual lunar activity
more on this as it develops
grace half watches the newscast as she finishes breakfast
bruce lies blissfully asleep
big smile life is good
then we hear whispering like distant voices murmuring all at once
bruce wakes with a start
he looks around puzzled sticks his finger in his ear checking his hearing as the voices fade away
circling getting ready to go on the carpet
bruce casually warns
uh uh uh
sam looks at bruce for a beat then walks into bathroom raises the toilet seat with his nos e and stands up on his we dont see it and starts
he looks proudly back at bruce
grace places breakfast on the table
bruce comes out fully dressed with a spring in his step
gushy lovey sing songy good morning
cooked you grilled cheese
oo my favey
bruce sits grace sets down his plate leans close
last night was just
bruce enjoys his grilled cheese
its funny but when i woke up this morning it felt like my boobs were bigger
bruce looks away guilty trying to be nonchalant
holding them up do they look bigger to you
ah no they ah look the same to me
they are clearly bigger
she holds them
theyre definitely bigger
they feel huge to me
bruce throws up his hands
you got me
probably just a hormonal thing
takes a quick final bite well enjoy your breakfast ive gotta run
where are you going
he stops turns
a new confident bruce
to get my job back
bruce heads for his severely beat up junker car whistling what if god were one of us
he gets in fastens his seat belt as two teenagers cruise by on skateboards stop outside bruces window
sincerely impressed wow nice car man
well it gets me from a to b
reveal bruces car is now a brand new mercedes vision slr
he starts and revs the powerful new engine and peels out
bruce turns the corner into bumper to bumper traffic
no problem the traffic magically opens up for him cars instantly swerving right and left clearing a path for bruce
he waves as he passes
and the last shall be first
a police dog hank performs some standard take downs by attacking a criminal trainer on the run
phil a reporter from a rival station is wrapping up his story
i certainly wouldnt want to be a fugitive on the run with hank buffalos number one police dog on the job
this is phil sidleman reporting from the police canine training center
beat and cut it
lets go guys
the crew start to wrap up
watching the action from the side holding his own home video camera
phil spots him
hey channel seven right
youre the guy that went crazy
yeah i had a bad day
but things are lookin up
what are you doin here
just lookin for a story
waving the video tape well this ponds fished out
pretty standard stuff anyway
i dont know
my instinct tells me theres something more
well go with that
its served you well in the past right
phil and a couple of his crew laugh as they load the last of their equipment into the van and shut the doors
hey hank found something phil turns back bruce and he exchange a glance
hank is digging furiously making a big hole
the policeman jogs over joins the trainer
they watch as two dress shoes are uncovere d in the di rt
we got a bodyi to his crew shit
get the camera now
it locks automatically
the cameraman yanks at the door
its locked and the keys are inside i bruce casually turns his camera on gives phil a tough break look heads for the scene as phil and his crew scramble
around the van
the body of jimmy hoffa was uncovered in a field today outside of a canine training center in buffalo new york
local buffalo freelance field reporter bruce nolan was the first on the scene
we cut to the pre taped story
bruce stands with hank and his trainer before camera the body being exhumed from the ground behind him
since the disapearence of teamster president jimmy hoffa in the nineteen sixties his whereabouts have remained one of this countrys great unsolved mysteries
that is until just moments ago when during a routine training session a police dog named hank sniffed his way right into the history books
as you can see behind us the body is being carefully exhumed and will be transported to a hospital facility where dna testing will confirm the identity
that of course only a formality as in a bizarre twist the body was found buried with a birth certificate and complete set of dental records
rubs hanks neck sort of a two in one for hank today as moments later he busted a local news camera crew with four kilos of marijuana
we see footage of phil and his news crew being cuffed on the ground as large stacks of marijuana plants are being pulled from the van
ive never seen it before i swear i as bruce pulls up in front of the building the no parking sign flies back into the bushes and the red curb
transforms to green as though being sloppily painted with invisible brushes
bruce exits the car and smooths past the homeless sign guy who sits in his usual spot
his sign reads bruce cruises through the office fielding greetings
nice job bruce
way to go buddy
go get em bruce etc
susan ortega smooths up to bruce
surprised oh susan

she gives bruce a look and continues on
bruce is a bit inflated by the encounter

bobby forces a ladle of rhubarb out at bruce

makes sound of chopper no bobby
bobby n i said i didnt want anything

bruce continues off as bobby stops cold adopts an odd expression then his eyes roll up in their sockets spin all from his skull
he turns instantly demonic
an overly perky female office worker approaches bobby from behind
is there any of that split pea soup left
she is instantly hit in the chest with a stream of green vomit
a beat and bobby offers out a plastic spoon
he sees bruce enter immediately perks up

dallas runs off
casual to an amazed news staffer you know he does have a certain pizazz about him
susan reaches for a water pitcher as a crew man steps in and blasts evans head with a fire extinguisher
evan is in shock his face now white
the screen cuts to a please stand by title card then cuts to an episode of dragnet
on bruce its fun to be god
bruce is bored off his ass interviewing some blue haired old ladies at the mark twain chili cook off
talks so slow you want to kill yourself my secret is i let the jalapenos marinade in a spicy sauce for over hours before i we see bruces pained face
realizing what horrible news this is when he gets an idea and schwwwwwaaaaaam
an asteroid crashes to earth behind them
hold that thought hazel
bruce walks back toward the explosion it seems some type of meteor or asteroid has by chance hit the earth right behind the mark twain chili cook off
bruce is free falling in full sky diving uniform
so remember its sky diving season at old petes airfield
grabs the ripcord this is bruce nolan
gives it a tug doesnt budge my rip cord appears to be a bit stuck
bruce yanks again harder nothing then again and the cord rips free from the suit
this is a very unfortunate turn of events
im heading toward the earth at a very precarious speed
the cameraman pops his shoot and we see bruce continue to stream toward the ground below
he falls into a wooded area
a camera on the ground picks up the coverage runs through the brush with other bystanders to find bruce laying on top of a big hairy creature
bigfoot broke his fall
bruce stands groggy points to a dazed bigfoot
you are real
bruce sits watching a hockey game on tv
he follows the puck intently with his eyes as though controlling its path
grace sits aside him working on the photo album
do you believe how theyre playing
beat oh honey would you hand me the scissors
bruce diverts his attention when the sabers screw up and the crowd groans
bruce immediately turns looks intently at the puck and goal sabers
the crowd roars
graces boobs are even bigger
bruce is trying to help her fasten her bra but its a good three inches from touching
bruce shrugs got me
bruce is doing a report just outside the pandas enclosure
in the past zoo officials have been unable to get these pandas to mate but that doesnt seem to be a problem today
reveal a male panda wholeheartedly humping another panda
and the mood seems to be catching o
wide shot of the enclosure pandas are coupled off and humping everywhere
mothers are frantically covering childrens eyes ushering them away from the exhibit
his stories are all over town
from unearthing jimmy hoffa
to an asteroid crashing to earth
bruce nolan is rapidly becoming known as
a billboard being put up with a big smiling bruce with arms extended
it reads mr
a close up of bruce on the jumbotron

bruce starts singing the most amazing gospel singer jazz oh say can you seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
debbie turns to her she shrugs
i didnt even know he could sing
grace opens the bathroom door revealing sam sitting on the toilet seat with a newspaper under his front paws
sam barks and grace quickly closes the door
bruce sings still on the same word
bruce finishes running a bath gets into the tub but slips as is unable to sink and ends up sliding around on the water like on a sheet of glass
he tries to break through cant
then he concentrates and finally lowers into the water
bruce dramatically finishes the national anthem
of the braaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaave i
he hits an impossibly high note and the rink glass shatters i bruce is projected on the arena jumbotron
he shoots his arms up the crowd goes nuts
exclusive flashes on the screen
a mob of photographers flash photos like crazy as bruce stands casually with his arm around bigfoot
and thats the way the cookie crumbles
bruce surrounded by hazel and other chili cook off contestants shouts up from the bottom of the crater hole
in unison and thats the way the cookie crumbles
the words flash on the jumbotron and the entire crowd chants and thats the way the cookie crumbles
grace lies in full body wrap while debbie is in the process of being wrapped by margarita a rather ruff spanish salon attendant
so this is what success buys you

margarita motions for debbie to lay down and leaves
debbie struggles to lay down

they both laugh and struggling to get up
hearing the ruckus margarita enters and gasps
lesbianas grace and debbie crack up harder

margarita tries to pull them up but falls too
no sexo no sexol grace and debbie cant stop laughing
a waiter pours the first trickle of wine into bruces glass
bruce whiffs it tastes it
if you run out just bring me some water ill take it from there
grace looks over the menu as bruce notices people at various tables eyeing him
he glances up to a ceiling light and redirects it with his mind so it spotlights him in golden light
two cute girls with dates smile and wave
he waves back
should we ask for a more private table
oh no this is fine right here
bruce looks at grace lovingly
he takes her hand
i was going to wait until after the meal but i think its going to just bust out of me if i dont do it now
grace beams looks at bruce with total love

they both laugh bruce enjoys the attention

grace sits watching the two girls take turns sitting on bruces lap taking pictures
sees bruce relishing in the attention
one girl gives bruce a peck on the cheek and they r ss
grace is clearly upset
you have lipstick on your face
bruce we need to talk
i thought we had an understanding suddenly the whispers start again
bruce looks around figures its coming from the restaurant patrons
its kind of loud in here
grace looks around the quiet romantic setting
what are you talking about
its not loud
the whispers grow in volume
shouts to the restaurant could you keep tt downl bruce this isnt funny
over the racket he gets up and darts off
bruce races through the restaurant kitchen holding his ears he bursts out the kitchen exit into the alley
unclasps his ears but no relief
the whispers are now loud voices
we start to make out fragments of words please help me etc
overwhelmed and scared he slides down the alley wall covering his face then total silence bruce lowers his hands and finds himself sitting atop a high really something isnt it
god sits down next to bruce
is this heaven
god laughs at this one
you should try flipping on the discovery channel every now and then
well i guess you cant now being dead and all
i god laughs
no im just messing with you
theyre prayers bruce
you keep ignoring them and theyre going to build up on

god forms a snowball in his hands as he talks
you arent listening son

didnt want to start you out with more than you can handle
now how you doing otherwise
personal life in good shape

a doorway opens like a crack in space
grace steps out sees bruce
what are you doing out here
with that the terrain transforms back into the alley where grace has been standing all along
she can not see
oh ah to god she cant
god shakes his head back to grace i just ah needed a little fresh air
bruce fakes a couple big breaths
bruce what is going on

grace looks at him like hes nuts

youre going to have to answer those things yknow

grace heads back into the restaurant
bruce stands completely frustrated
to god thank you

grace is asleep in the bedroom while bruce paces in the living room
he concentrates for a second and in an instant the whispers start in
okay first off this creepy whisper thing has got to go
paces organization and management
i need a system
an idea prayer files commands let all prayers be organized into files
bruce waves his hand instantly the room is jammed full of file
too b ulky
praye r po st it s
instantly the files are gone and millions of post its each with a persons prayer request begin slapping down attaching themselves to everything in the room
bruce himself becomes a big post it mummy
he pulls the one covering his mouth
an idea ah
bruce sits before a high tech computer sitting on a desktop
we hear the famous youve got mail sound bite
welcome to the information super highway
no mess full bless
a computer progress bar titled downloading prayers appears on screen theres a long long way to go
bruce watches and waits bored looks at his watch
hes fallen asleep by the computer
as he wakes he sees unread messages whoa
suddenly grace bounds out of the bathroom
okay this is getting ridiculous i graces boobs are enormous
a healthy d cup
i have to see a doctor
theres definitely something wrong with me
bruce jumps up from the computer hides what hes doing
you look great
i look like a hooker i my whole body is changing

she breaks away and sees the computer is on

bruce looks over graces shoulder and adjusts the clock forty minutes forward
grace turns and is surprised

a new sporty red convertible wrapped in a white bow

bruce turns away from the window gets back to the computer
lets start with something easy
typing find sports
reading please make the sabers win the playoffs good
please please let the red wings beat the sabers
bruce puzzles over the two prayers
yes to you loyal sabers fan
and no to you
typing and your goalie has turrets
bruce smiles this is fun
emails scroll stop at filbert davidson re gym class
a bully taunts a fat kid with horn rimmed glasses
the fat kid nervously grabs the rope and much to his surprise he climbs it like stallone in cliff hanger
bruce is in the stands pleased
he flicks his finger upward and the bullys gym shorts shoot up his butt crack a supernatural wedgy
filbert flexes his flabby arm amazed
ester maha re bankruptcy bruce looks in the bank window and sees a very stressed ester sitting in the loan officers office tears in her eyes
as she opens her purse for a tissue it is full of cash
she registers shock and joy
ask and ye shall receive
close on a middle aged woman driving a car in a parking lot
me find a space
she drives right by bruce who smiles
knock and the door shall be open
bruce makes a knocking motion and
all the signs fall off their post
the painted wheelchair symbols on the pavement animate wheeling themselves off the spaces
she pulls into the now open spaces
bruec watches a stickball game in progress
one prisoner chases a batted ball to the prison wall revealing a huge hole to freedom
looks heavenward thank you god
construction workers stand staring down in awe as woman after woman on the sidewalk below stop raise their tops and flash thank you god
grace bends over to help with a craft revealing ample cleavage
subtitles read thank you god
he shovels a scoop of paste in his mouth
bruces hands typing responses
his fingers move faster and faster
i want to be bigger text and dissolve to a young man growing six inches
he smiles wide close up computer text snippets dissolve over one another please help my stock go up
make a killing in the market
then another i want to be bigger this time dissolve to a grown man peeks down his pants smiles wide
bruce walks along head high full of himself
he audibly hears snippets of prayers snapping off responses
ive got to find a better job
come on light turn
god i wish i were thinner
promotion with raise
donuts are now healthy
bruce sits at the computer looks at the total prayer requests his jaw drops
million and growing
oh come on

this is going to suck up my whole life
bruce gets an idea pulls down a menu on the computer highlights answer all types in the word yes and hits enter
the computer takes over answering each email automatically
bruce smiles and gets up
we see the list scroll by everything from lost cat to yes send yes send and on and on
very uncomfortable struggles for the right words as hes firing somebody
look this isnt easy for me
were starting to get some complaints and
well bobby things just arent working out
bobbys demon looking head slowly rotates degrees on his scared an you can keep the cart if you like
we can see bobbys breath now
deep demonic voice thanks

grace just stares at bruce
theres only one problem
i hate it
bruce is surprised
what were you thinking
why didnt you talk to me about this
i wanted to surprise you

appreciative of what
the fact that you didnt include me on a major life decision or that we now live in the sultan of bernais house

grace heads down the stairs
come on grace lighten up
the office is throwing me a party here for getting anchor

were just starting to have some fun
no youre just starting to have fun
suddenly the toilet flushes off camera
grace sees sam in the bathroom spraying some deodorizer before he exits
and what in gods name is going on with that dogi
grace pulls her cell phone
out of her purse heads for the door
im going to have debbie pick me up

she starts out
oh and that poor struggling guy you talked about

the party of parties is in order
the place is jam packed with co workers fellow reporters and various news contacts everyone is in an ecstatic mood many prayers having been recently answered
we move through the party and hear snippets of various conversations
ill drink to that
my tech stocks tripled in five days
they clink glasses

my son pitched a no hitter
i lost ibs on the krispy kreme diet
walking on his hind legs delivers a cold beer to bruce
well on his way to plastered takes a swig then glances at the beer
to sam hello
pointing to bottle corona
lime next time
sam walks away his tail between his legs
bruce maneuvers down the hall dancing high fiving drunkenly accepting the praise coming at him from all sides
there he is
all hail our new anchor
i bless you
hey bruce who do you like in the game tonight

coach prays a lot
a french waiter approaches bruce
nolan were running out of hors doerves
im afraid we under ordered sir
and the people are hungry
what do you have left
the waiter holds up a small basket
only three chips and two shrimp
confident just take it around
the waiter gets a confused look
the waiter walks along amazed as handfuls of shrimp and chips are pulled from the small basket
partiers crowd around bruce start to chant
bruce takes center stage quiets the crowd
i d thank you all for coming but the liquor is free so maybe you should thank me
and now let me tell you a story
there was a man who had two sons
the younger son took his inheritance and squandered his money on a life of lust and debauchery
i love that guy
everyone throws their hands up and continues to party
bruces big smile fades
he looks around the room hoping to spot grace
he grabs a phone walks out to the balcony di al s he gets their answering machine hears their outgoing message together from happier times
he hangs up
bruce turns sees susan ortega completely stunning in a sexy dress
hi br uce

grace stops dead in her tracks
her face drops
graces pov bruce still lip locked with susan ortega
bruce turns and sees grace

grace stops opens her purse tosses the keys to her new car in bruces chest

debbie pulls up grace storms off to the car

grace turns and heads to the car
youre the one that didnt like the new place
grace gets in slams the door

debbie peels out
desperate last attempt i could make you stay
bruce is left alone in the middle of the street
i dont need you
i have everything i need
did you hear that
yelling i have everything
bruce walks in susan is waiting for him
i was right
she couldnt handle the fire
bruce looks at susan with disgust then glances to a fire alarm on the wall mentally triggers it
the sprinklers turn on as well
people scream rush toward the exit
bruce sits down on the sofa being rained on by the sprinklers alone
he finally plops back and god is sitting next to him
enjoying your party
yeah nothing like spending time with some real frien ds
any s hrimp left
grace left me
certain shell take me back
uncertain will she take me back
would you take you back
bruce mulls this over then
how do you make someone love you when you cant effect free will
welcome to my world son
you come up with an answer to that one you let me know
off of bruce thinking
graces alarm goes off
the radio comes on and it plays a john cougar mellencamp song
but the lyrics are different
heres a little ditty about grace and her man bruce two americans growing up needing to make a truce
graces eyes pop open
is she dreaming
bruce hides behind a hedge watches grace jog past
notices something carved in the tree it reads grace bruce
carved in the next tree a couple for the ages
carved in the next tree come on already give him another chance
she does a double take continues on
grace reaches in her purse to pay for her coffee and a bunch of pictures fall out
they are all of bruce and grace
she thinks definitely didnt put them there
grace is helping one of the kids when she notices something outside the window
its a cloud formation that strangely looks like bruce in profile holding hands with grace
she reacts as the imagery melts away into a very faint forgive grace is talking with one of the other teachers
the kids playing dodgeball in the background laugh and scream louder and louder
grace turns and sees
bruce getting pelted by multiple balls
okay surrender surrender
he walks over to grace
i ah have my first anchor tonight
i hope it goes well for you
hes hit in the head by a ball
grace cant help but smiles bruce leaps at the opportunity
i miss you
off her silence i just took the first step shot myself out on the ledge awaiting vulnerably your response
i dont know what to say
how about you love me and youll take me back
come on what about all the signs
how do you know about that
did you talk to debbie
beat would it help if i told you i acted like an ass
martin is standing nearby
hey you said ass
its okay as long as you mean a donkey
i didnt add hole
its only bad when you say ass ho
alright inside martin
to the others okay everyone inside
the kids race in
grace starts to follow
none of this seems right without you
off her reaction is that a glimmer of hope i see
i have to go
she starts off
bruce dramatically raises a hand toward grace like putting a love spell on her
now how do you feel
she looks at him oddly
are you out of your mind
have you been drinking
drin kin g
im dru nk wit h bruce raises both hands in full hexing fashion
a beat you need help
she heads back inside
bruce throws his hands in the air frustrated
bruce heads for his car as he sees a two guys in prison suits from the prison yard drive off with it
hey thats my car
the prisoners drive off laughing
ha nice wheels huh
bruce sits up in the back seat
thou shalt not steal
the prisoners jump
car show them the way out
instantly the car doors fly open and the seats tilt sideways dumping the prisoners
what is wrong with the world
the dow skyrocketed again today and with a new influx of paper millionaires analysts are warning of a potential run on banks
we see a stock graph superimposed on the screen with a ludicrous jump straight up off the charts
the scene nearly turned violent when hundreds of disgruntled buffalo residents protested the results of lasts weeks fluke lottery results
another arrests today at the beasley construction site for indecent exposure
we see women getting pulled away one by one into police vans after they flash their tops
in the background a girls gone wild van is there rolling tape of each flashing
the worlds gone mad
jack clicks off the monitor
bruce hustles in from make up
an air of forced confidence about him
nothing and no one is going to ruin his big moment
oh there you are
your big debut
how you feeling
you know what
the show must go on
bruce sits in the anchor desk breathes in the reality
whispers bruce if i had any idea grace was going to be there last night
susan you didnt do anything wrong
in fact i found the moment rather pleasurable
susan shudders tries to compose himself
flustered oh really
okay the sabers just won the stanley cup
its getting pretty crazy out there
were going to kick live to fred at the stadium
oh and bruce you won the pool again
exact score dead on
twenty three to one who would have thought
bxa this is it you good
bruce nods straightens in his chair prepares for his dream the eyewitness news opening plays then fades away to bruce and susan
im susan ortega
im bruce nolan and heres whats m ak i n g n e ws and the screen goes to static
lights dim in the studio
what the hell happened
the stage manager listens to his wire
we lost the signal
its another power surge
ever since that damn asteroid hit
the power comes back up
we apologize for the interruption and now back to the news
thank you susan susan gets a feed in her earpiece
im sorry were going live to rupp arena where the buffalo sabers have won the stanley cup
bruce is noticeably bothered
fred is with the coach
the team is celebrating champagne rains down
im here with coach tucker who has lead the sabers to their first championship in years
on bruces mounting frustration
he gives a look
tell me coach
freds face registers a pained look
he tries to keep it together
a beat of silence
quickly i have to use the restroom
he drops the mic and runs out
off the coachs puzzled look
what the hell
well get back to the saber victory in just a moment
in other news again static
jack tosses his headset
oh for the love of godl what is it now
the stage manager again listens to his wire
the whole booth is down
a brick flies through a front window
bruce turns to see
a full on riot in progress
college students city dwellers going crazy
cars are burning people are out of control
escaped convicts are running in and out of stores looting right alongside ordinary citizens
the kowolski brothers and momma kowolski are helpless against the onslaught as pillagers run out of the bakery carrying cakes pies bread whatever they can get their hands on
bruce stumbles through the mayhem confused
whats going on
they continue to trash the area
but your team wonl cars are being rolled over
a lone police officer protects himself with his shield as hes pelted with various debris
the officer pulls bruce down behind a car
where are the other officers
what other officers
half the force just retired
said their ship came in
you better get home pal
i ts dangerous out here
the officer heads out
bruce stands then quickly ducks as a bottle is tossed through a window that has a lotto sticker on it
the lottery sucks
i only won bucks i bruce looks up at a burning building with a flaming mr
exclusive billboard above it comes crashing down
bruce looks out over the rioters
we see the anger build in his face like moses looking down on the israelites
he raises his arms
dark clouds swirl in hear o buffalo you have awakened my wrath
vengeance is mine
a bolt of lightening shoots right into the middle of the rioters scattering them
people flee in every direction as thunder crashes and lightning bolts continue to strike
bruce stands alone in the street surveys the smoldering mayhem then reaches into his pocket and pulls out the key god gave him
he grips it tightly and
bruce stands there sees god as he originally found him mopping
god looks up at bruce not surprised to see him
theyre all out of control
i dont know what to do
you mind giving me a hand with this floor first
off bruces look
bruces sleeves rolled up mopping next to god
poor man wanna be rich rich man wanna be king kings disatisfied cause he rules everything
god contd to bruce springsteen
i like a little boss in my head while im workin
they finish up
god looks back at the sparkling floor satisfied
there we go
no matter how filthy something gets it can always be cleaned right up
god collects bruces mop
i gave everyone what they wanted
god sets the mops down
since when does anyone have a clue about what they want
god holds up a remote and clicks changing the room into the diner where bruce first parted his soup
note whenever the room changes were actually still in the room but seeing a full projection of an environment on the walls and columns the older waitress ginnie clears some
ginnie bends down behind the counter and when she comes back up she is a hot year old
ginnie thought she lost her beauty when she got older
im trying to convince her otherwise
ginnie bends down again and when she comes back up she is her older self again
god clicks the remote changing the environment into a school yard
we see the grade school where filbert davis the boy bruce helped up the rope is in a fight
ah yes filbert
brilliant young man
he was going to be a great poet
god contd the soul of his work would have been built out of his hardships
he would have touched millions
feigns cheery but now hes headed for a career as a professional wrestler
god clicks changing the environment into a condo
we see a lonely woman who found the cash in her purse sitting depressed rocking in a chair
i love ester
ester was bankrupt
she was going to have to eat her pride and call her sister
wouldve got the two of them together again
instead she bought a condo in florida
god clicks the remote again
recalling bruces own words and have you seen the news lately
we see footage of the arctic sea and north and south poles
scientists believe last weeks asteroid may have knocked the earth off its access resulting in the rapid acceleration of the melting of the polar caps
more footage of floodwaters and rising tides
and more tidal wave activity reported and resulting in devastating floods all tied to last weeks abnormal lunar activity
we see footage of decimated crops
that swarm of locusts spotted in buffalo has multiplied wreaking havoc on local agricultural crops
food and produce prices are expected to skyrocket
to bruce again using bruces words now what kind of a god lets that happen
god clicks the images off
not as easy as it looks is it
this god business
so what do i do
god smiles asks him again what he asked him in the alley
you want some advice
god smiles starts to walk away
everybody wants a miracle bruce
want me to do everything for em
but what they dont understand is theyre the ones holding the power
god claps the bright ceiling light on walks over to the latter
where are you going
this is good bye bruce
youve learned a lot
i think you should be able to handle things now
god climbs ascending into the light
what if i have a question
what if i need you
god stops looks down to bruce
see bruce thats your problem
thats everybodys problem
you keep looking up
he smiles and disappears into the light leaves bruce thinking
bruce stands in the apartment sam at his side
no signs of grace
the bed is made
then he notices the box of photos the incomplete albums
he picks up a photo of he and grace in an even tinier apartment sam is a puppy they have little money and despite it all look very happy
bruce smiles at the memory
reaches for a stack of photos
bruce sits in bumper to bumper traffic
a mans car is broken down in the middle of the street causing the bottleneck
bruce sees the sign guy by the side of the road
his sign reads all for won
bruce looks out at the other drivers honking and shouting at the frustrated man
cut to the stalled car is now rolling to the shoulder and we reveal that bruce is doing the pushing
the auto function is answering yes to the prayer emails
bruce clicks cancel turns off the computer
filbert davis is beating up another kid
bruce watches at a
bruce giveth and bruce taketh away
suddenly filbert goes to throw a punch but his punch has no sting
the bigger boy looks down and grins
the teacher stands before the class reading a students paper
by filbert davis
as she reads the poem pan to filbert davis seated in class with a ripe black eye
bruce is waiting for sam to pee
come on sam
lets do this the right way
bruce pulls out a swatch of carpet lays it on the grass
sam happily goes
they walk off together
thats not normal you know
bobby places three blue home address number tiles on the counter all number
demonic voice do you have these in red
bruce walks up behind bobby
okay bobby its time to come back
bobby hisses at bruce turns insanely demonic
it casual un damn you bobby
bobby instantly transforms to normal
hey thanks bruce
holds out a cookie biscotti
evan is packing his things at his desk still looking much worse for the wear
bruce walks up to him
youre probably here to gloat over the anchor position
go ahead im sure i deserve it
you know evan
ive been a real prick
evan stops looks up at bruce confused
you were born to anchor
im not taking the position
oh and i never really congratulated you on getting the job in the first place
bruce offers his hand evan takes it
when their hands meet there is a kind of electrical charge that passes between them
bruce walks off evan is confused when he catches his reflection in the mirror
hes back to normal
evan is manning the anchor desk and looking good doing it
jack is relieved
in the financial world things are settling back to normal in what analysts are calling a fluke market fluctuation
you made the right choice jack
so what about you
what will you do
with your permission i think ill go out there and make the people laugh
to quote a friend god knows we could use it
bruce turns to go then turns back
oh are you hungry
i know a place that makes a mean tomato soup
bruce walks along side jack
jack talks and talks happy to have the company
bruce opens a door for jack leading to
bruce and jack take a seat at the counter
jack and the waitress lock eyes theres an instant attraction
this is a friend of mine cindy
cindy this is jack
sm itte n smit ten hi
his sign reads
pull back to reveal bruce sitting next to him with his own sign reading whatever fl said with a little arrow pointing to the homeless sign guy
bruce paces waiting for sam
you can do it sam
without the carpet
bruce celebrates does a happy dance and is surprised to see debbie standing there
re the peeing dog looks like your rain dance worked
you know i never got to apologize for i didnt really come to chat i came for graces things
debbie is packing items into a box
she sees the photo albums on the coffee table
she flips through surprised
you did all this
debbie looks at bruce sizing him up
you really hurt her you know
debbie starts to go but turns back
you know what i do before i go to sleep every night
i tuck my kids in bed i eat a scoop of ice cream and watch conan
debbie contd you know what grace does
most of the time for you
this not only touches bruce but it gives him an idea
bruce sits anxiously at the computer with sam checks the e mails and types in grace connelly
he hits search
the woman does pray a lot
he types in grace and bruce and eagerly awaits
there are matches
he checks a few
dear god please help bruce to find himself find contentment find you
dear god please help bruce
hes struggling to find meaning
dear god help bruce to be happy
he cant seem to find his way
over and over he finds the same prayer the same entry every morning and night for months on end
bruce is touched
she still loves me buddy
he kisses sam and races out
bruce stands in front of the house with flowers another special creation
he looks at the lavish bouquet then sets them down picks a single normal daisy from the garden
he heads for the door when he hears crying
he looks up sees a light on in the upstairs guest room
he climbs the fire escape and looks in the window
grace is sitting on the bed crying
as bruce watches her cry feeling her emotion it starts to lightly rain
through her tears she is praying
bruce looks at her with total love
i still love him
bruce smiles thankful
but i dont want to love him anymore
help me to forget
cries i dont want to hurt anymore
i want to forget
bruce just stands there stunned
he gets it
he raises a hand and with a simple wave he performs an excruciatingly selfless act
he lets grace go
her face changes
she wipes her eyes
the pain is lifted
and it is bruce now who feels that pain
he looks at grace
a sad smile
rain droplets splash on the river where bruce first raged at god
he stands in the middle of the street looks up heavenward weakly
i m done
i dont want to do this anymore
i dont want to be god
sighs please help me
and with that the rain stops
the dark clouds slowly open as beams of light cut through shining down upon bruce birds begin to chirp
adding to this magical moment as
a mac truck slams through frame mows bruce down
his spirit remains in the same spot looking confused then streaks up heavenward
shooting heavenward like a missile through the clouds through the sky to
a huge white room no walls just white as far as the eye can see
the flooring is the whitest of white puffy clouds
bruce finds himself standing there
he looks around and when he turns behind him he sees god
floating on nothing as though sitting in the most royal throne
you cant expect to kneel down in the middle of a highway and live to talk about it
i work in mysterious ways son
a beat as bruce takes everything in
you knew it all along
you knew if i got everything i wanted i would ruin my life
god doesnt respond just listens
so im dead
if this is what you want
god holds up the prayer beads tosses them to bruce
bruce looks at the beads then up at god puzzled
go ahead use em
ive learned that i dont know as much i thought i did
boy you can say that again
hey im praying here
if i could have just one thing in the world
it would be for grace to live a happy joyful life
and that she finds someone
getting emotional as he realizes what hes saying that she finds someone that will treat her with the love and respect that she so deserves
god smiles the most satisfied of smiles
now that is a prayer
beat well i better get on that one
see ya bruce
off bruces puzzled reaction he drops through the clouds falling pov back down towards earth back through the clouds and right into another white room where
bruce eyes open and he gasps for breath
the prayer beads still clutched tightly in his hand
two doctors stop giving bruce cpr see that his vitals have returned
bp over and rising
to bruce bruce
can you hear me
bruce nods we almost lost you there
wider angle the white room is a hospital room bruce is heavily bruised and bandaged
you lost a lot of blood
it wasnt easy to find a match youre a very rare blood type
bruce looks to the blood bag sees a b positive written on the side
groggy whisper a b positive
you should thank god for donors
we dont have a lot of that type on hand
theres your angel now
bruce turns toward the hospital door and sees
a cotton swab taped to her arm
now he remembers where he heard of that blood type
re her swab i hear that all of this winds up in a warehouse somewhere
but you know me im a sucker for this stuff
the doctors give grace the nod to enter as they go leaving the two of them alone
grace tentatively approaches
i dont even know what im doing here
when i heard that youd been in an accident and that you might not make it
she starts to cry
hey im okay
does it hurt
only when i talk
and yknow exist in general
thats one thing bruce could always do is make her laugh
grace spots the prayer beads in bruces hand raises his arm
oh my gosh you still have those
bruce looks at the prayer beads then looks at grace
he remembers his prayer to god and the emotion wells within him what is it
its just really nice to see you
she goes to him bruce sits up a bit and they embrace
a big blood drive in progre ss
everyone is there grace sam debbie and zoe ginnie and jack the kowolski brothers momma kowolski evan susan dallas fred
bobby serves various food items from his cart
you know french toast was invented by tavern owner joseph french who had a poor knowledge of grammar and did not know how to use the possessive apostrophe so he
called it french toast instead of frenchs toast
pull back to reveal bruce crutch under one arm cast on his leg mic in hand reporting
hes now talking in his own voice much more himself
this is bruce nolan at buffalos first annual be the miracle blood drive
remember the life you save may be mine so hurry down
i had a close call and well can you imagine what life would have been like without me
laughs in the background from the people that know bruce
bruce walks over to the kowolski brothers
in honor of this event the kowolski brothers have baked a one of a kind creation
the brothers proudly unveil the special cookie and we see that its a huge syringe shaped chocolate chip cookie
sure a little creepy and a shameless plug but we love em
bruce breaks off a little piece takes a bite mmm good needle
remember thats kowolskis bakery
