leaving las vegas by mike figgis by mike figgis based on the novel by john obrian september it is the kind of bar where the well to do folks of
la go to pick up or be picked up
lesser known actors agents and executives of all ages
into this bar comes ben
ben is in his thirties
he is wearing an armani suit that could use a visit to the dry cleaners
he hasnt shaved in the last twenty four hours but neither has any of the actors in the bar
he is a good looking man but is clearly in trouble of some kind
although still in control of his faculties it becomes clear in the following scene that he is much the worse for wear with drink
he looks around the room until he sees someone he recognizes and then walks over to a table where two couples are seated
the men are young execs the girls both blonde and busty have very white teeth and smile all of the time
the camera follows ben over to the table
one of the execs looks up as ben gets close
he recognizes him but delays his recognition until the last moment in the hope that ben is not looking at him
how are you man
they shake hands
ben is not invited to take a seat and peter waits for a while before being forced to introduce him to the table
ben sanderson marc nussbaum sheila debbie

i think i spoke to you on the phone a couple of years ago
werent you both at mgm with laddie
are you still at icm
no im at tri star now

there is an awkward silence
ben does not make a move and is not invited to join them
the girls smile
i gotta tell you im a big fan of your writing
i loved bay of pigs
thanks a lot
i didnt actually write it i just got the credit
i was fired
to peter can i talk to you for a moment
peter gets up and he and ben walk to the door together
peter speaks very quietly

this is the last time
i just need some cash tonight
i lost my credit cards
the moneyll be on your desk first thing tomorrow morning scouts honor
hows the new one coming along
i here you got richard gere
the two men look at each other for a while
peters friends are looking at them as are other people in the room
peter takes out his wallet and extracts some notes
this is all i have in cash
please dont drink it here
yes thats fine
ill messenger it over to you tomorrow
i dont want it
i think it would be best if you didnt contact me again
and he turns and walks away back to his table
a blaze of color in the middle of a desert
credit sequence begins
a mixture of businessmen and gamblers creates a sense of activity and superficial excitement
music wafts across the soundtrack almost drowned by the dense texture of thousands of slot machines creating an insane new age symphony
credit sequence ends
into the lobby from the street comes sera
its hard to tell how old sera is somewhere between twenty five and thirty five
she is a beautiful american girl
her face has the freshness of a model in a sears catalogue
she is dressed simply in a short black skirt and matching jacket
high heels complete the picture
heads turn as she passes a group of businessmen and its clear they find her very sexy
she acknowledges their glance with a half smile and steps into the elevator
she could be a secretary or a pa to one of the many execs here in las vegas at a convention
the body language is a bit different though
a view of night time las vegas through a window
traffic up and down the strip bright gaudy neon flashing and winking
we hear the sound of men laughing and the camera pulls focus and we see reflected in the glass
a group of people
on the table are bowls of potato chips and dip and sandwiches
the tv is on at a sports channel and two boxers pound the shit out of each other
sera looks at herself in the gold tinted mirror in the elevator
she takes out a lipstick and freshens her lips
some people get out and the elevator climbs higher
we see from the indicator that she has punched the penthouse button
camera moves in tighter and we see that she is nervous but concealing it well
the elevator stops the doors open and she steps right into the penthouse
a bottle of scotch is almost empty
the man talking is yuri
he is russian in his early forties a little overweight a big man wearing a blue silk suit
his thick black hair is greased and combed back
he wears a lot of jewelry all gold
rings a bracelet and a rolex
two men in business suits and a weird stoned woman in her late thirties listen to him
but please my friends call me yuri
it is my american name
i picked it myself
the three people laugh
there is a hint of contempt in the way that they speak to yuri
where are you from yuri
i mean you sure dont talk like youre from this neck of the woods
yuri smiles at them
silky voice no
you are right my friend
how very observant you are
i am from latvia
yes i hear this too
but i am not a tough man
i am a simple man who is here to learn from my new american friends
the door opens and sera comes in
everybody stares at her
turned on is this your friend yuri
the second businessman takes out a small manila envelope from his inside pocket
yuri contd sera is my gift to you my friends from new york city
you may do with her as you wish in this beautiful room which is also my gift for the night to my friends
you will find her a very willing girl for all of you
just as we arranged
yuri smiles again as the second businessman hands him the envelope
the rest of them just stare at sera aroused by the idea of her
of course yuri
i think youll find this just as we discussed
yuri gets up
so my friends
i have other business to attend
he heads for the door passing sera
she holds out his arm as he passes
can i talk to you for a moment
still smiling he takes seras arm and leads her into the bedroom
excuse me for just one moment
mirrors reflect mirrors
i dont want this
i really dont want this
you know i dont like to do groups
playful i want this sera
i need this
he holds put his arms
sera goes to him
he hugs her with one arm
he pulls up her skirt so that her panties are exposed
seductive these are pretty
sera watches in the mirror as he pulls her panties to reveal her buttocks
he strokes her there gently with his other hand
we see that there are two fine scars there
he speaks gently like a father to a daughter
yuri contd is this how you would repay me for coming all this way to find you again
driving through the desert to protect my little sera
yuri and sera different time different place
sera looking frightened backing away from yuri who pulls a switchblade from his jacket and opens it
yuri enters from the bedroom
the weird woman is doing a line of coke
cheerful sera wanted me to ask if she might undress at once for you
she has a very beautiful undergarment witch she would like you to see
sera comes into the room
she smiles and begins unbuttoning her jacket
she takes it off and drops it on the floor and then unzips her skirt and steps out of it
sera is now in control and playing the room
in the background
yuri leaves the room
strange voice come here
sera walks over and something strange takes place between them
the bar is dark but through a small window we see that it is a very bright sunny day outside
the bartender reads the los angeles times
the bar surface is red vinyl
there are five customers all single men
one of them is ben and he is sitting at the bar watching tv
a game show is in progress and the tv sound is loud
ben finishes his drink and grimaces before indicating to the barman that hed like a repeat
barman pours him a whiskey cranberry and the camera moves in closer to ben ending in a close up
ben takes a big hit from the drink and concentrates on the tv
we hear from the tv sound that it is a word game with a big prize
ben smiles to himself
the talk show hostess an american tv beauty is showing the audience the prizes available in todays game show
as he finishes that drink and asks for another
the camera moves in close on his eyes
she turns from the prizes and looks straight into the tv camera which starts zooming into her
at first what she is saying makes complete sense but then things change
smoky sexy voice just look at this studio ben filled with glamorous merchandise including an extra special prize chosen just for you
a big bad bmw motorcycle complete with saddle bags stuffed with thousands of us dollars
there are oohs from the audience
so ben tosses her hair lets find a bar get drunk and go for a ride
the studio lights dim
then we can get a suite somewhere and order up a case of champagne while we fuck ourselves silly
close up on males in the audience doing the grunt
this is it just for you ben
she unbuttons her top licks her fingers and makes her nipples hard
because youve been so patient and because i want to fuck you take care of you and because theres nothing else in the world worth doing
section of the audience clapping some women dabbing their eyes
tell you what ben lets go to las vegas
the bars stay open twenty four hours night and day
just you just me ben think about it all right
lost in his fantasy ill think about it
he looks back at the screen but the show has returned to what is known as normal
he finishes his drink and then an attack of nausea hit him
he takes a deep breath and rolls his neck and his head
the barman puts down a fresh drink
ben looks at his own hands
which are steady
you should go on that show
ben sitting at a desk with a phone wedged on his ear a cup of black coffee on the desk
the walls are covered with framed film posters and one complete wall has shelves jammed with scripts
he nods from time to time and sometimes says yes or ok but it becomes clear that there is no one on the other end
he drinks from the coffee cup
a woman comes up to his desk a business colleague
she puts a wad of messages down on the desk
yeah but whats the back end like
by the time were through with p and a the above the line is going to take it to about fifteen and with something like this
i dont know if disney will go for it
can i call you back on this
chow for now
to the woman good morning
simpson was looking for you
i said that you had a doctors appointment
he said for you to go in as soon as
are you ok
pulling himself together im fantastic but i gotta go out now
very important meeting could make a coupla million for the company
ben gets up and as he passes her he grabs her and dances a few steps
it is clear that she likes ben but when his face gets close to hers she smells the alcohol on his breath and she turns away
ben stops dancing and smiles sadly
you should go now
she leaves the room and ben goes through some routine at the desk
he opens a drawer of a filing cabinet and puts in his whole arm looking for something at the very back
he pulls out a small vodka bottle and opens it and then pours the contents into his coffee cup
with cup in hand he leaves the room
ben is sitting opposite his boss mr
simpson who is very upset
he hands ben an envelope
ben opens it and pulls out a check
he looks at the amount
genuinely moved this is to generous peter
close to tears well
we liked having you around ben but you know how it is
ashamed sure thing
and im sorry
ben takes a swig from his coffee cup
trying to cheer things along well
what are you going to do now
i thought i might move out to las vegas
simpson looks puzzled
the bars never close
ben drives though beverly hills
he pours the content of a small bottle of vodka into an empty coke can puts the empty bottle under the seat and then drinks from the can
he slips a tape into the player and we hear lonely teardrops by michael mcdonald one of bens favorite songs
at a traffic light a cop on a bike pulls up next to him and ben takes a pull from the coke can and smiles mouths the word hot
the cop nods back at him the light changes and they both pull away
ben carries a brown paper bag which clinks
camera follows him as he walks down the street
he looks at
a girl walking ahead of him in the same direction
she is walking her dog
she is attractive from behind
we hear bens thoughts
voice over beautiful no just the shape which is nice but the whole walk the feeling the movement
this girl is pleased with herself
maybe this is the only art i can appreciate
i dont know if this is good or bad but right now she is really beautiful
when i was a boy it would have been really important that she have a pretty face to go with this body i mean
i still would like to see her face but her beauty is no dependent on her face
the dog gets interested in something on the sidewalk and she bends down to pull at its collar
voice over i wonder what kind of panties shes wearing
shit thats too specific but
on the other hand you can never be too specific
but then the infinitesimal must be by definition as infinite as the infinite
suddenly the girl stops
ben catches up with her and cannot resist looking into her face
voice over god shes so young
the girl sees ben and smiles an innocent smile hi
ben walks up to his house still carrying the paper bag
a young boy of about thirteen years of age is fixing a beat up bike
ben greets him
hows it going
there were a couple of guys looking for you
what did they look like
i didnt tell them anything
you know anything about gears
ben takes a look
the gear mechanism is all bent out of shape
he bends down to have a look
it is clear from the way he deals with this mechanical problem that hes good with his hands
he doesnt try to force anything but he moves the chain and gear mechanism to get to the problem
howd this happen
i was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up
the news is not good kid
this bit here
you need a new one
upset how much do you think
i dont know
ill find out though
ben gets up picks up his bottles and heads for his house
he looks back and brad is sitting still by the bike looking totally dejected
this really seems to upset ben
ben is naked and the shower can be heard in the background
the house is austere only the minimum of furnishing
he pours a large tumbler of vodka and takes a gulp then tops up the glass
he turns on the stereo selects a record miles davis kind of blue and puts it on the turntable
he turns on the cassette recorder and inserts a new blank tape
he puts the machine into the record mode
he kneels down next to the deck and with complete precision puts the needle on the second track without any problem
the music starts and continues through the next sequence
ben is in the shower with the glass in his hand
ben shaving with the glass in his hand
he does the area around his mouth first so that he can drink while he does the rest
showered and shaved and wearing a smart dark suit ben looks handsome and normal
he selects another record and again sets up the cassette machine to record
he turns the stereo up full and dances by himself while watching mtv silent
he tries a turn which is a bit ambitious and loses hi balance
in slow motion we see him fall
ben lies still on the floor
he smiles to himself and decides top stay there for a while
sera wakes up in bed next to yuri
the camera is high above the bed looking down
she is completely drenched in sweat
a thin shaft o light comes from the crack in the drapes and falls across their bodies
other than that the room is in darkness
to get out of bed she would have to climb over him
she lies still
yuri speaks without opening his eyes
i missed you sera
you have been lonely
sera blinks and turns her head towards him
im older now yuri
he puts his hand between her legs over the sheets and grasps her there
you have been lonely
tensing a little ive been all right
i will keep you safe
we are both older
he climbs on to her and mounts her
you have been lonely
flat voice i am lonely yuri
he begins thrusting into her
so am i
camera move slowly into a tight portrait of sear
voice over i had a new dress
we were at the fair daddy bought me an ice cream and i spilt it on my dress
sera is sitting on a sofa talking to an unseen person
although it is no entirely clear when this is taking place the sense of it is that we are in present i
all the events in the film are in the past tense
mom was with helen and dad looked around first to see if she was watching and then he scraped it all off and threw it on the grass and then
he kissed me and hugged me and told me it was all right
yuri is tucking into a hearty breakfast
sera plays with her food
planning his day this is such a small apartment sera
i cannot stay here
we will find a big apartment
you know how much money i can bring you
i belong in
laughs wealth and luxury
he suddenly looks up from his food and smiles at her
why did you run away from me in los angeles
sera says nothing
because you are sly
you knew all along that there was more money in las vegas
sera nervously plays with her food
you have nothing to fear from me
you know why
because we belong together sera
sera forces a smile
grainy black and white image
sera on a bed pinned down by yuri who has a knife
im pleased with you sera
how you have moved up in the world
i showed you a glamorous world when i took you off the streets
shaking his head and how you repay me
where have you been staying
with an old friend
he drops his fork
but that is none of your affair
you will call this morning and book me into a hotel suite where i will make new contacts for us
the mood has changed and sera does her best to move out of these dangerous waters
youll need some money then
sera rises goes to a kitchen drawers and finds money
becoming angry it is after all sera my money
calmly yes of course
how much do you need
shaking his head all of it
i need to buy many things
all of it
yuri is very angry and as sera hands him the money he hits her hard knocking her back into the refrigerator
his ring cuts her cheek
shouting dont look at me like that
and then his anger goes and he becomes quite tender with her
he takes her face in his hands to look at the cut
its not so bad
it is nothing
whispers i need money sera
i need it fast
you must go on the street tonight
he sits down with shaking hands
he suddenly seems more vulnerable than she is
he goes to the window and looks out left and then right as if he expects to see something
i need money fast sera
i want you back on the street
ben opens his eyes
the only light comes from the tv
the miles davis record has got caught on a scratch and is repeating the sane phrase over and over again
he looks at his gold rolex and then fingers the wedding band on his finger
ben is sitting at the bar
he drinks a large glass of something very quickly and then immediately orders another
he drinks this a little slower but still too quick finishes it and then orders another
he looks around the bar and sees a woman sitting by herself thirtyish pretty and receptive
she looks and sees ben and he smiles at her
she smiles right back
ben talks across the bar
charming good evening
ben walks over to where she is
she is pleased that this good looking man has come over to make a play
she makes a noise with her straw to indicate that her glass is empty
ill get you another one
and me too
mind if i join you
she watches him walk to the bar
he gets the drink and walks back to her
he sets the drinks down on the table and sits down
as he does so his face gets close to hers and she smells the booze on him
been drinking all day
but of course
she looks at him a disappointed expression on her face
she is no longer interested in being seduced by this man and this much is clear to ben
why dont we finish these and go to my apartment on the beach
she doesnt respond
we can watch a movie and ill mix you up a gooey blender drink
ben winces at his own words
he shakes his head
i have to get up pretty early tomorrow
ill just finish this and go
they drink in silence for a while
ben takes a deep breath
pathetic i really wish that youd come home with me
youre so cute and im really good in bed
you smell good too
he stops and frowns as he stares into his empty glass
ben tries to stand and has to pull himself up by holding the bar
its a strange thing with drunks like ben
when theyre up they have balance and timing but when theyre down it all falls apart
she starts to speak but then doesnt
a look of great sadness comes over her
i have to go now
she stands to go
maybe you shouldnt drink so much
she walks to the door and ben turns to the bar watched by he barman who is a little concerned
to himself maybe i shouldnt breathe so much teri
sever voice time to go buddy
were closing up
ben gets out his wallet but his hands are shaking so much that he cannot extract any bills
he is very embarrassed and tries again but to no avail
the barman shakes his head in disgust as he goes into the wallet and takes some money
ben is cruising in his car listening to music on his stereo
ben comes into the club and sits down next to the stage where a dancer is doing her thing accompanied by a live blue trio
a swimsuited waitress comes to the table
theres a one drink minimum per show i hope you saw the sign when you came in
anyway theyre supposed to tell you
yes i heard and its not a problem
what do you want
what are my choices
everythings ten dollars and theres no alcohol
you gotta get something else
everythings ten dollars
what do you want
what do you think i should get
non alcoholic malt beverage
sparkling apple cider
one drink minimum per show
everythings ten dollars
tell me what you want or ill eighty six you
she writes down w
and walks away
ben calls her back
just how much would it cost for you to eighty six me
a tough black girl dances in a world of her own impervious to the men who stare at her
the trio grinds out a dirty blues
a man opposite ben places a dollar bill on the stage and as the dancer squats down to pick it up he stares between her legs an winks
the waitress puts down a styrofoam cup and a bottle of water in front of ben but refuses to look at him
hostile three fifty
ben puts down a hundred on to her tray
polite could i have fives please
keep one for yourself
this throws the waitress for a loop
ben drinks all of a fifth of bourbon
other guys come and go pissing against the urinal
ben offers one of the guys a drink the pianist from the trio
he takes a shot
ben sits next to another man watching the show
on stage a tall blonde dances with her own reflection in a mirror
ben turns to his neighbor
to me nothing is more beautiful than the relationship between the reflection of a woman and the woman who has created it
completely uninterested no shit
ben drives in his car
ben is cruising in his car listening to lonely teardrops again
hes looking for a prostitute
he sees a girl but when he slows down she ducks into a doorway
he looks in his rear view mirror and sees a cop car coming up fast
ben panics for a second
there is a bottle between his legs
the cop car draws level and cruises alongside him for a while but then puts its lights and siren on and speeds off doing a u turn
ben continues and then sees an hispanic girl and stops
he winds down the window
he is by now almost incoherent
the girl looks up and down the street and then walks over to the car and bends down to the window
you wanna date
you wanna date me
the girls eyes shift constantly from ben to the street and then back again
cut to the chase ill give you a hundred dollars for a straight forty five minutes
you get the room
ben shows her the money
trying to take him the room is twenty
you pay for it
but only because i think that the concept of surrender fits in with the big picture right now
how about over there
he gives her a twenty and indicates a motel across the street
she sets off and he gets out of the car
as he does a wave of nausea hits him
he shakes his head violently and then lurches across the street causing two cars to hit their brakes
the camera follows him into the dark parking lot of the motel where the hispanic girl is waiting
slurring badly i canremember
or illeff her
the girl laughs at ben and says something in spanish
slowly the picture gets darker until all that can be seen is the headlights from the passing cars on sunset
ben wakes up on the kitchen floor
the fridge door is open and its light is what lights ben
inside the fridge are one green pepper and four bottles of vodka
without too much effort ben feels for his wallet and sees that it is still there as are his car keys
he closes the fridge door and in the green light from the window he lies still
the first birds start singing
the birdsong continues through the following sequence which does not have sync sound
at the rear of the motel
next to some garbage hoppers the hispanic girl hugging him and kissing his neck
he tries to kiss her on the mouth but she turns her face away
ben lying on the floor thinking
the hispanic girl kneeling in front of him unzipping his trousers
through a gap in the fence we see traffic going up and down sunset
ben lying on the floor thinking
the girl takes his hand and kisses it
she begins sucking the fingers taking the whole hand into her mouth
ben suddenly sits up and looks at his hand
his wedding ring has gone
he thinks about this for a long time
ben waiting in line to cash a check
he looks unwell and is having difficulty standing straight
at last it is his turn
he goes to the counter and hands over a check to the girl
four thousand six hundred dollars
one moment sir
she looks at her computer read out
thatll leave five dollars in your account
would you sign the back of the check please
surprised you couldnt cash it just like it is
puzzled im sorry sir
is there a problem
ben picks up a pen and tries to sign but his hands are shaking so much that he cannot do it
to tell you the truth im a little shaky right now
i just had a brain surgery
why dont i come back after lunch when im feeling a little better
we can take care of it then
ben seated at the bar a pile of bills in front of him
the barman sets down a vodka picks up the empty glass and takes some bills shaking his head in disapproval
the tv is on some game show as before and ben watches carefully looking for a sign from the girl but the show proceeds in its normal fashion
the only difference is that the hostess is played by the girl in the bank
ben grabs the barmans attention
i think when im done with this ill have gin and tonic
bombay gin and tonic
the barman loses it angry you should be having coffee
do you know what time it is
youre a young man
calmer its none of my business but if you could see what i see you wouldnt do this to yourself
ben is taken aback by the emotion in his voice
in his mind cynicism and the desire to cry fight it out
he holds the emotion back and looks down at the bar
i understand what youre saying
i appreciate your concern
its not my intention to make you uncomfortable
serve me today and i will never come in here again
cheerful if i do you can eighty six me
sure sure i can eighty six you now if i want to
stop fucking with me
i dont give a fuck what you do
he picks up a bottle of gin fills a glass slams it on the counter in front of ben and knocks twice with his knuckles on the bar
on the house son
ben looks at the tv for a sign
none is forthcoming
ben waiting in line again
the same bank girl is there and she is dealing with her customers in the same inanely cheerful way that the game show hostess dealt with her prize winners
she notices ben waiting and an irritated look flashes over across her face
ben studies her
she is pretty in an ordinary kind of way
we hear bens thoughts as voice over or maybe he says them out loud to himself
voice over are you desirable
are you irresistible
maybe if you drank bourbon with me it would help
maybe if you kissed me and i could taste the sting in your mouth it would help
close up on the bank girl as she does her thing efficiently counting money smiling perfect teeth framed by a cupid mouth
she is wearing a white blouse through which frilly lingerie can just be made out
if you drank bourbon with me naked
if you smelled of bourbon as you fucked me it would help
it would increase my esteem for you
if you poured bourbon on to your naked body and said to me
camera moves in tighter on her face as she chats with a customer about the weather
if you spread your legs and had bourbon dripping from your breasts and you vagina and said drink here
then i could fall in love with you because then i would have a purpose to clean you up and that would prove that im worth something
id lick you clean so you could go away and fuck someone else
ben takes a moment to come out of his reverie
he smiles and comes to the counter completely in control of himself
im back ive got my check
im ready to sign
he flips the check over makes sure she is watching and signs with a flourish
steady as a fucking rock excuse my french
serious wanna have dinner with me
she counts the money out and glares at him as she hands it over
im glad youre feeling better
do you need a validation
ben looks at her and smiles
ben throws items into a trolley
garbage bags firelighters and charcoal lighter fluid
ben putting all the kitchen utensils into a large garbage bag
three other bags are already filled and the kitchen is looking empty
ben is stuffing all the bedding into a garbage bag
next he opens a drawer on the dresser and begins taking out clothes and stuffing them into another bag
he pauses for a moment to take a drink from a tall glass
all the books from the bookcase go into another bag
then all the records
but he selects certain favorites and as this sequence progresses we can see that ben is making tapes of these tracks
as soon as he is done with the recording he throws the album into a garbage bag
ben pours lighter fluid on to a pile of photographs and then throws a match on to it
it bursts into flames
he throws more stuff on and the fire blazes
a curious neighbor watches from a safe distance not wanting too get involved
a watercolor a poem to his wife photograph of him and his wife a polaroid of a naked woman his medical records his birth and marriage certificates divorce papers strips
of photographs from booths postcards from hawaii
two small children his
now the flames are high and ben has to stand back as he throws things on to the fire
his camera an engraved box his wifes left behind clothing a clock
fifteen neatly tied garbage bags and bens furniture are stacked up on the sidewalk
ben comes out of his front door carrying a racing bike
he walks to the neighbors house and places the bike on the porch
we see a label saying to brad from ben
he walks to his black car with a small suitcase gets in and drives off
a high wide shot shows a small black car making its way across the frame
through the window we see a dead straight road stretching to infinity
the sunlight is painfully bright
on the soundtrack we hear one of bens chosen tapes which continues through into the next shot
ben is filling his car
a town car drives in and stops next to the bmw
three men get out
they look like russian mobsters
ben nods at them and they nod back
same angle through the window but this time we see las vegas at night as ben drives down the main drag
an overdose of neon
ahead we see the light changing but ben doesnt notice until its almost to late
the car stops and we see sera crossing in front of the car
she gives ben a look of real attitude because he is over the line and she has to change course to cross in front
sera is talking to yuri
a middle aged man gets out of a cab and yuri shakes him by the hand and introduces him to sera
he hands yuri an envelope and then sera and he go into the hotel together
yuri looks around thoughtfully before getting into a cab and driving off
ben waits to check in while the manager explains the house rules to a family of large people from the midwest
all rooms to be paid a week in advance maid service is optional use of the pool is at your own risk there is no lifeguard on duty
above the managers head is the name of the motel the whole year inn
ben stares at it and then smiles
the sign has changed to the hole youre in
ben has almost filled a trolley with bottles of various brands
he is whistling and seems happy
he sees sera and follows her then drives up on the sidewalk
she sees him
are you working
what do you mean working
and she walks a few steps to prove it stopping on the passenger side of his car
they pause for a moment and ben is confused
he is quite taken with her beauty but this is not going according to plan
he reaches into the car quickly and picks an open can of bee draining it before tossing the empty back on to the rear seat
isnt it illegal to drink and drive
laughs thats funny
seriously i wonder if youll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me
sera doesnt say anything
that is if youll come to my room for an hour i will give you five hundred dollars
maybe you shouldnt stand in the road like that
youre pretty drunk
he bites his lips as he waits for her to respond
softer youre pretty drunk
factual not really
my rooms not far
the whole year inn
you can drive with me if you want
she makes no response
or we can walk
or ill give you cab fare
takes out his money
whatever you want
she touches the door handle
why dont you give me the money when im in the car and ill drive you
it takes a moment or two to register that she is saying yes
he comes around the car to open the door for her
they shake hands
she gets in
ben gets in
ben hands her the money
sarah with an h
they grin at each other
you wanna start the engine
they drive off
they sit in the car for a while before speaking
im sort of curious
if youre willing to pay me two fifty
not that i mind
i mean im ok with that why arent you staying in a hotel
we can go to one if youd prefer
no this is fine
i was just wondering
ben switches off the engine but makes no move to get out of the car
im here because im a drunk who tends to pass out at odd hours for unpredictable stretches
im going to a hotel soon
a room with a balcony to pass out on
he falls silent
we can stay in the car for an hour if you want
but i really have to go then
its your time
right ill get your door
i tend to fade in and out lately
i guess i do too
i sometimes fade out
well maybe we better synchronize our spells
or stagger them
gently you were going to get my door
he gets out and she waits for him to open the door
she gets out and he offers her his arm
she takes it and they walk into the motel
as ben closes the door
sera surveys the room
amused what this room needs
is more booze
there are bottles everywhere
ben has gone to a lot of troble to lay them out in a pleasing way
do you think so
she turns and looks at him appraising him
suddenly shes all business in control and ben likes it
mind if i use the bathroom
she goes into the bathroom
want a drink
im having one
sera off screen a shot of tequila if you can spare it
ben smiles happier than weve ever seen him
he gets her order ready and then he takes a big swig from a bourbon bottle
he sits on the edge of the bed
the bathroom door opens and sera comes in wearing a black bra and panties
shes acting the hooker now tough and sexy
for two fifty we can do pretty much what you want
youve been drinking so it might be better if i got on top but the other ways fine too
i have some jelly in case you want to fuck my ass thats up to you
if you want to come in my face thats ok too just try to keep it out of my hair i just washed it
and my eyes it stings
she walks to the table and downs her tequila in one
then comes to the bed where ben is sitting
she kneels unzips his fly and begins sucking him
ben watches her looks at her reflection in the closet mirror reaches for the bottle and drinks some being careful not to disturb sera
after a while sera comes up
do you want to fuck now
confused maybe another drink first
she takes the bottle and drinks
she goes down again
ben stops her
whats the story
are you too drunk to come
sincere i dont care about that
theres time left
you can have more money
you can drink all you want
you can talk or listen
just stay thats all i want
she looks at him confused
she sees a strange look on his face
it throws her
this is a turning point
both of them are momentarily exposed
ben lifts the sheet and moves to one side indicating that she should come into the bed
shes as confused as he is
she gets in with him and he hands her the bottle
yuri is losing at one of the tables
he continues to bet though putting half of what he has left on one number
he lose again
he mops his face with a red silk handkerchief and places another bet
the three russian mobsters we saw in the desert are walking through the casino looking for someone
they are both in bed drinking
so ben what brings you to las vegas
they both laugh and ben hands her the bottle
no i came here to drink
yes thats right
he looks at her she at him not sure whether to believe him or not
i cashed in all of my money paid my amex card gonna sell the car tomorrow
how longs it gonna take for you to drink yourself to death
i think about four weeks and ive got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day
that should do it
what am i
and your meter just ran out
ben looks at his watch
talk some more
ben yawns suddenly deeply tired
in la i kept running out of booze and the store would be closed because id forget to look at my watch
so i decided to move here because nothing ever closes and because i got tired of getting funny looks when i would walk into a bar at six oclock
even the bartenders started preaching
yawns again here everyones from out of town so no one cares no one is overtly fucking up sera is in focus ben is asleep
sera voice over i guess i was intrigued by him
there was a lot of stuff that i wanted to ask him about but didnt because i didnt want to sound too interested in a trick
but i felt as if a relationship was being forged very quickly
sera gets out of a cab and makes her way towards her apartment changing out of her high heels as she walks
sera lets herself in
yuri is standing in the shadows
she gets a fright when she sees him
where have you been
it was a slow night
i went to a hotel for a few drinks
yuri holds out his hand for her bag
she gives it to him
he finds the money and counts it
a full night on the street and this is all
like i said
it was a slow night
it was hard to score
yuri slaps her
dont hit me
what do you think
you are sixteen years old on hollywood boulevard
yuri talks in russian becoming angrier and slaps her again
he spits on the floor
sera falls against the kitchen table and picks up a lethal looking knife
maybe nobody wants to fuck a chick with a cut on her cheek
she throws the knife to yuri who catches it
she bends over the table and pulls up her skirt
there go ahead
she mimics him
a shower of russian comes out of yuri but he doesnt touch her
he tries to regain his dignity by putting on a coat
i could kill you
you know that
he goes to the door
work tonight bring me money no matter the hour
and he exits
sera is still on the table
i will yuri
the proprietor is handling over some cash to yuri whose jewelry is on the counter
he pockets it and as he turns to leave ben comes in
they pass without taking much notice of each other
ben removes his rolex and shows it to the man
yuri is walking in the hot sun sweating
we see him through long lens heat haze
the camera wanders into the traffic and we see the black town car crawling along behind him three men inside
a lounge singer belts out a fair rendition of a tony orlando number
sera sits at the bar an empty seat on either side of her
she watches a younger hooker in the final moments of pulling a dangerous looking man
the girl is aware of sera without even looking at her
the guy she is with looks around and sees sera
the girl shoots an icy look
a man sits next to sera a conventioneer
about ready for another drink
yes that would be great
are you her for the convention
do i look that obvious
my names paul
they shake hands
no of course not just a wild guess
im sera and thats a margarita
the barman is already pouring
the young hooker leaves with her dangerous guy
she pauses long enough to give sera a nasty smile
the conventioneer pays for the drink and is a little lost for words
sera tries to help
are you alone or are you just using me to make someone else jealous
laughs nervously alone
im here alone
friendly where are you staying
suspicious right here at the hotel
moving a little closer well
i thought you might be looking for a date
shocked a date
what are you a hooker
voice getting louder what do you mean a date
and louder ive got a wife back home
i just came over to talk for a few minutes
quietly im sorry i guess i misunderstood
she looks around
please dont raise your voice
i wont bother you about it again
you seem like a nice girl
im just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money
he gets up
here have another drink
i gotta go
sera is uncomfortable
people are watching her aware that something has been going on
the barman comes over to where sera is sitting
maybe you should give it a miss for this evening
he walks away
sera finishes her drink and leaves
sera at work is looking more carefully than usual hoping to see ben
a huge silver limo pulls up and after some negotiation she gets in
long lens shot of ben very drunk on the street
he falls and lies still for quite a long time before getting up
he falls into the road and tries to hail a cab but none stops
a cop car cruises to a halt and ben more or less imitates a normal person as he walks out of shot
ben dives in and swims a length under water
he pulls himself out and sits next to the large midwestern family
the father says hello and introduces his family to ben
they are all very friendly
its a nice atmosphere around this pool and for a moment ben even looks healthy
a limo pulls up and sera gets out
she sees something
ben sitting at a bus stop drinking out of a cocktail glass
when he sees her he gets up a little unsteadily
i couldnt remember what happened last time
i was afraid that i might have been rude or mean to you
he looks at her
if i was im sorry
no just drunk
but thats ok
wheres your car
i sold it this morning
im going to take cabs from now on in
sera looks up and down the strip
dont run away
defensive why should i
i know youre not a cop so what is it tonight
another two fifty to watch you sleep
ben sits down a little hurt
i was looking for you tonight
i dont know if you have a boyfriend
or a girlfriend but if you have some free time
maybe we could have dinner
tough again but pleased are you serious
deadly serious i think you know im serious
ill pay you if you like
but id like to see you
no i cant have dinner with you
and she hails a taxi which stops immediately and she gets in
the mojave hotel please
ben watches the cab drive off
sera walks along checking numbers on the doors
she finds the right one and knocks firmly
its me yuri
the door opens a crack and yuri peers out
he looks around for a clock
sera comes into the room takes her purse out and counts out seven hundred dollars
lots of tricks
i think things are picking up
yuri sits on the bed
he looks unwell and disoriented
his face is covered with a thin film of sweat
he seems to be listening for something because he stops her talking by putting his fingers to his lips
he looks at her and then beckons her to the bed
sera is nervous
as she walks to the bed she begins unbuttoning her blouse
yuri stops her with a wave of his hand
sera is puzzled and frightened now
yuri seems to be deranged
have you told anyone that im here
yuri suddenly hears something
he grabs seras hand and takes her to the wall
he presses her head to the wall
do you here that
he looks at her
theyre talking about me
he pulls himself together
stay at home
i will call you tomorrow
he indicates the wall
this is very important
and i must listen
they face each other for a moment and then yuri does an almost comic gesture to tell her to go
he hustles her to the door and shoves her out as she is still buttoning up her blouse
he slams the door
through the door goodbye sera
dont come back here
i will not see you again
sera stands there for a while almost in shock and then she begins to walk
the camera follows her as she makes her way down the endless corridor of doors
ahead of her three men are walking towards her checking the door numbers as they make their way
sera doesnt take them in
they pass and turn a corner
we recognize them as the men from the black town car
the men have stopped outside yuris room
the camera pans and we see sera down the other corridor getting into the elevator
ben is lying on the bed watching a game show drinking
a coughing fit hits him
he is very short of breath
we see how ill he really is
there is a tap at the door
the tapping persists and eventually ben gets off the bed and unlocks it but keeps the chain on
it is sera
still want to have dinner
ben stares at her for a while
i have to change and take a shower first
if you want to come home and wait
ben opens the door
we should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way
i owe you one
sera is finishing in the shower and ben is sitting at the kitchen table
he gets up and walks around the house trying to get a sense of her
the furniture is very plain and there is spartan quality about the hose
he looks with interest at the bookshelf which has a good selection of literature
to himself this is the home of an angel
sera off screen you ok out there
take your time
he pours himself another drink
sera off screen pour yourself another drink
he sots down and she comes in toweling her hair
you look extremely beautiful
what time is it
my watch went the way of the car
he holds up his empty wrist for her to see
then looks up and sees her watching him
i really like you
you make me want to talk
i dont know what time it is
i like hearing you talk
businesslike if you feel up to a short walk theres a place to eat around the corner
all the food in vegas is terrible so the place doesnt really matter
how does that sound to you
do they have drinks
ben and sera walk and talk
ben and sera are eating
he plays with his food eating very little of it
finally he pushes it away and orders another drink
im from the east
i went to college did an arts course
i now live in vegas
i think of it as home
i came here deliberately to carve out a life
i was in la before but ill come back to that later
pause the tough times are behind me now
i can deal with the bad things that happen
there will always be dark characters
but my life is good
it is as i would want it to be
so why are you a drunk
is that really what you want to ask me
worried well then i guess this is our first date
or our last
until now i wasnt sure it was either
sera thinks for a while and decides to give in to him on this
its our first
im just concerned
why are you killing yourself
interesting choice of words
i dont remember
i just know that i want to
want to kill yourself
are you saying that youre drinking as a way to kill yourself
and she leans across the table to be close to him listening intently
ben becomes uncomfortable and tries to joke it off
or killing myself as a way to drink
sera continues to stare at him wanting to know the real answer
he takes a slug from his drink
she sits back
well talk about it some other time maybe
sera relaxes and continues with her food
we hear her thoughts for a moment
o it wasnt so important to me
i mean he never asked me why i was a hooker sand that was impressive
i really liked him
so i decided to just play my part
its good to help someone once in a while
its a bonus to being alive and that was my plan
to stay alive
i suddenly came to a decision
what are you thinking
are you angry with me
decides something ben why dont you stay at my place tonight
look youre so drunk
i like you
i trust you
i hate to think of you in that cheesy motel
and she folds her arms and grins at him
lets face it what the fuck are you doing in las vegas
overwhelmed by her im going to move to a smart hotel tomorrow if itll make you feel better
looks at her lets talk about tomorrow
wanna do something
then please stay at my place
you know im not much good in the sack
its not about sex ben
ill make you up a bed on the sofa
do it for me
we can talk till late and then sleep till late
as you know i am my own boss
ben laughs loud the most animated weve seen him and his laugh as infectious and sera join in
other diners turn to stare at them
they seem like a couple
ben and sera walk and talk holding hands
a wide shot
the black town car makes its way across frame
left to right
seras house day ben is asleep on the sofa
as he wakes up he becomes aware that sera is watching him from across the room
they smile at each other
how long have i been her
three nights two days
when is your rent coming up at the motel
i dont know
sits up ill go and sort it out today
why dont you come
well find a real room for me
you can pick it out a tower on the strip
theres no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room
what do you mean
what i mean is that you should bring your stuff over here
were spending all this time together
what the fuck
lets face it ben were having fun here
ive never done so much talking in my life
lets dispense with the formalities
i want you here
sera you are crazy
im not too concerned with long term plans
dont you think youll get a little bored living with a drunk
that is what i want
why dont you go and get your stuff
you havent seen the worst of it
these last few days ive been very controlled
i knock things over
i throw up all the time
looks at her now i feel really good
youre like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance but that wont last forever
youll get tired of it really quickly
they sit in silence for a while
ok you go back to your hotel and ill go back to my glamorous life of being alone
she walks out of the room and into the bathroom where she sits on the toilet to pee
to herself the only thing i have to come home to is a bottle of listerine to wash the taste of come out of my mouth
im tired of being alone
thats what im tired of
she finishes wipes herself and flushes the toilet
pulling up her panties she walks back into the bedroom where ben is putting on his shoes
dont you like me ben
devastated dont be silly
ben is unable to deal with the fact that he is absolutely in love with her
he walks out of the room
we gotta decide this
before we go any further
you either stay here with me or
ben turns to look at her
we cant see each other any more
ben and sera look at each other for a long time
what you dont understand is
ben is deeply troubled
he comes to a decision
you can never
ask me to stop drinking
do you understand
dead serious i do
i really do
i have to do some shopping alone
you go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things
dont hurry and ill be back before you to let you in
sera grabs him in a big embrace that knocks him off balance and into the wall
she kisses him all over his face and squeezes his skinny frame
ben is packing his liquor into his suitcase
the almost empty bottles he pours into a large cup which he drinks from
the suitcase is now full and ben suddenly realizes that he hasnt packed any clothes
they are all in a pile on the bed
he talks to himself
maybe this isnt a good idea after all
he tries to put clothes in with the bottles but the lid wont close
he sits on the bed and has an imaginary conversation with sera
the thing is that im nuts about you and this is a bad thing
because my real plan is to die here and you were never even part of my plan
but like i said im nuts about you
wait a minute i have an idea angel
and he opens the closet and finds some plastic laundry bags which he puts his clothes in
seras neighbors a husband and wife are standing outside her house
they stop her
they are also her landlord
we didnt know whether to call the police or not
and they indicate the sleeping figure of ben in the doorway clutching a bottle of bourbon using hi suitcase as a pillow
hes been there for about half an hour
my husband thought hed seen you two together but i thought it best to wait until you got home
yes hes my friend
i guess he just had a little too much to drink
smiling uncomfortably ill help him inside
puts down her packages thanks for the concern
sorry to trouble you
gallantly well call me if theres anything i can do
they go to their own house
sera opens the front door kneels down next to ben and shakes him gently
can you wake up
ben opens his eyes and looks around with a pleasant cheerful expression
why dont you go in and sit down
i have some gifts for you
ben stands and almost loses his balance
he picks up his suitcase and attempts to pick up her packages as well but she stop him
ben staggers in with his case
as sera enters she looks around and sees husband and wife at the window still watching
ben off screen want a drink
wanna go out tonight
i need to keep pretty low key around here
maybe next time you could nap this side of the door
that was the landlord
she reaches into her purse
gift number one
and she gives him a newly cut key
he takes it and tries it in the lock then drops it into his pocket
i used to carry a lot of keys but one by one they all fell victim to the great condensation
now i have just this one
and he tails off and stares at the floor
she waits for him to continue and then comes to him and touches him on the arm
he shakes his head
i was miles away
he sees the parcels
i have to sit down for this
he strides into the living room and flops on to the sofa
sera i love that name
before we proceed onwards there is something i need to say
ive come this far
here i am in your house
i want you to let me pay the rent for this month
and he stares at her as if to say that nothing can happen until this matter is resolved
its better for me that way
she is uncomfortable
they sit in silence for a while
i hope that you understand how i feel about this
first of all youre welcome to my money
we can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest
but i dont think youre talking to me right now about money
i think youre talking about you
ill tell you right now that im in love with you
but be that as it may im not here to force my twisted life into your soul
i know that
and im not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life
we know im a drunk
but that seems to be all right with you
and i know that youre a hooker
i hope you understand that im a person who is totally at ease with this
which is not to say that im indifferent or that i dont care
it simply means that i trust and accept your judgement
what im saying is
that i hope you understand that i understand
thanks i do understand
i was worried about how that would be
but now im not
and you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job
i suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck
whatever that means
open your presents
she hands him the larger of the two parcels
open this one first
ben awkwardly unwraps the present a large colorful shirt
a genuine smile comes on to his face
he holds the shirt against himself
this should work very nicely with my suit which by the way is the only item of clothing i brought over from the motel with me
sera raise an eyebrow
the suitcase was clinking
so what did you do with your clothes
laughing i threw them into the garbage
which was perhaps immoral but i wanted to come to you clean so to speak
i thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day
smiling nice talk ben
in between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool some interesting words fall from your mouth
she hands him the last present
now try this one
ben unwraps the smallest gift
it is a silver hip flask
he is very touched and a little tear trickles down his cheek
looks like im with the right girl
he turns it in his hands
i must say that im very impressed that you would buy this for me
i know you wouldnt do this without thinking about it
you did just what i would have done
ben stands and tries the flask in his pocket for fit
it is fine
he walks to the door
im going to fill it right now
do you want to go gambling tonight
we could go out and play for a few hours
ben comes back into the room takes the flask out of his suit pocket and has a drink
i hadnt planned to gamble
but if you would keep the bulk of my money here then i could safely blow a couple of hundred bucks
he takes out all of his money peels off a few hundreds and then gives her the rest
giving you money makes me want to come
pause im going to change
ill be half an hour
and she leaves
there is a slight edge to her voice and ben is not sure if he offended her or not
he watches through the small angle of the door as she changes
i am planning to go out and do some work
tomorrow night as a matter of fact
ben and sera walking
the camera follows them
he is wearing his new shirt and looks good in it
she is wearing a green dress and mismatched earrings and looks great
they walk and talk
i like your earrings
he changes sides
i like women who wear mismatched earrings
i hope we dont run into any tonight
laughs what do you mean
i expect some kind of loyalty here
just because i fuck for money doesnt give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly
and she stops and looks at him smiling but serious
and i only have eyes for you
and we both know that you would never become romantically involved with a trick right
they walk around the huge space which is full of people and energy and suddenly ben grabs sera and pushes her against a slot machine and kisses her deeply
at first she resists and then she gives in to him and responds
they knock over some change which falls to the floor and ben pulls from her a beat to bend down and scoop up all the change and hand it to
the bemused player before returning to seras mouth or more
they break for air and then ben leads her towards the bar
as he waves to attract the barmans attention she squeezes his arm
quietly i love you
but he doesnt hear her
on long lens we see ben and sera at the bar
suddenly ben seems to fall asleep
sera tries to wake him and then he goes crazy and falls backwards off his stool knocking a waitress and her drinks over
security guards appear and begin arguing with sera
ben wakes up on the sofa fully dressed
a night light gives a soft glow
he rolls off the sofa landing on all fours on the floor
he crawls to the kitchen opens the fridge door and takes out a vodka bottle and carton of orange juice
with difficulty he gets to his feet finds a glass and pour s a drink
he swallows the mix and then stands over the sink just in case he has to vomit
sera wakes and ben comes in and gets into bed with her
how are you doing
i never expected to have to ask you this again
but how did our evening go
i remember getting to the casino
i remember kissing you
that was really nice but everything after that is a blank
well i was prepared for worse but it wasnt so bad
we were sitting at the bar talking about blackjack
you seemed just fine a little drunker than usual but nothing really strange but then your head started to droop and i put my arm on your shoulder and then
wham you swung you arm at me and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress
you smashed everything on her tray it was a real mess
you kept yelling and yelling
oh and what did you do
i tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me not like you wanted to hit me but more just waving me
security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling
they wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street but i talked them into letting me walk you out
how did you do that
i told them you were an alcoholic and t would take you home
i also promised that we would never come in there again
holds her hand what happened then
you were ok for a while so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck but i think even you knew
that wasnt going to happen
we got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store even though i told you that we had plenty at home
in the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change
i asked you if you knew it was a hundred
you said you did so i let you do it
we got here you fell asleep on the couch and i covered you up and came to bed
i warned you
kisses her hand but im sorry
heres my speech
kisses his hand i know this shouldnt be acceptable to m but it is
dont ask me why
i sense that your trouble is very big
and im scared for you
and so im doing what i think you need me to do
falling down in casinos is little stuff
it doesnt bother me
it has nothing to do with us
what are you
some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies
how can you be so good
she turns away to the wall and curls up like a small girl
i dont know what youre saying
im just using you
i need you
can we not talk about it any more please
not another word
he thinks about this
he gently pushes her until she is lying on her front and then he pulls up her nightdress and strokes her naked back
he kisses her in the small of her back
why dont you go back to sleep
ill go out and buy us some breakfast
he stands and goes to the door
as he leaves the room she calls after him
ben im working tonight
he opens the door and smiles at her
ben gets out of his cab and walks up to the doorway of a grocery store
it is locked
ben looks at his wrist and then remembers that he no longer has a watch
he looks around sees something and exits frame
ben enters and makes his way to the bar
this is a dirty dark place
an ageing blonde in leather hot pants is dancing by herself at the jukebox
a very drunk biker couple argue noisily in a corner slurring their words
there ins not much gambling taking place at the eight slot machines
ben sits at the bar and the bartender slaps down a paper napkin
a beer and a double kamikaze please
anything to eat
not quite yet
first i have to drink myself sober then
a few crackers maybe an egg and toast
the bartender walks away to get bens drinks ben continues anyway
then ill go home with the groceries and well have breakfast together and thatll make her feel better about my condition
ben is interrupted by the arrival of the biker girl
she is young tough and pretty
she puts an arm around him and presses against him
who the fuck are you talking to mr
laughing why are you all dressed up honey
my dont you look fine
she runs her tongue around her mouth
i am very bored with my date
would you like to buy me a drink
ben looks around and sees the biker staring at the two of them
loudly do you mind if i buy her a drink
i dont care what the fuck you do with her
maybe i could buy you both a drink
dont fuck with me motherfucker
go to it shes waiting for her drink
the biker walks over to the slot machine and begins dropping in quarters never taking his eyes off ben and the girl
see what an asshole he is
big smile ill have a rum and coke
a rum and coke please
the girl leans with her back to the bar closer to ben who is facing the bar on a stool
she brings her face closer to his
can i stay with you for a while
you mean move in with me
isnt this a bit sudden
oh i dont have a lot of stuff
smiling i dont think my wife would dig it too much
she moves to his ear to whisper
maybe we could just go find a room and fuck all day
you wouldnt have to tell your wife about that would you
i could suck you like this
and she begins sucking on his lobe
at the slot machine the biker is still watching
his face fills with a drunken rage
see the thing is
fucking you would be wonderful but i am deeply in love with sera
the biker throws down his beer can and walks towards the bar
and its almost impossible for me to imagine being with someone else
the biker arrives at the bar and grabs ben
now listen asshole im not gonna just sit around and watch her suck on your ear
the biker is about to hit ben then holds back
he leans in and puts his face next to bens
now i know that she came over to you like she does so im gonna pretend that youre innocent and give you one chance to walk out of this place
to biker get lost jerk
the biker slaps her and then grabs ben by the collar
what do you say
ben shakes his arm free from the bikers grip
he thinks about it for a couple of beats and then decides
but she and i have decided to spend a few hours together in a mo the biker headbutts ben in the face sending him crashing off his stool to the
his head cracks against the tiled floor
the biker walks over to him picks him up by his shirt front and punches him in the nose
blood sprays on to his face
the biker walks out of the bar
the girl follows him quickly
the bartender takes a wet towel and walks over to where ben is struggling to get up holding his face
youre quite a fighter
he gives him the towel
this may sound silly but im going to have to ask you to leave
its what we do around here when theres a fight
mens room is around the back
ben lets himself in with his key
he is carrying a big bag of groceries
his clothes are bloodstained
the landlady watches from poolside
he walks into the living room and finds sera reading on the couch
she looks up and sees his face and his bloodstained shirt
oh fuck ben look at your face
you get in a fight
i thought you didnt fight
how do you feel
she goes to the bathroom and we hear her rummaging in the medicine cabinet
sera off screen did you stop at the bar
she comes back into the room armed with bottles and cotton wool
did you say something stupid to someone stupid
she goes to work on his face dabbing an open cut with some mercurochrome
i was defending the honor of some poor wayward maiden
she thinks about this for a moment and then kisses him on the forehead
why dont you go and finish this in the bathroom
take a shower and put on your other shirt
ill fix breakfast and then well go shopping and get some new clothes
i think this suit must be unlucky
ben and sera come out of a clothing store
ben is wearing black jeans red socks and a white dress shirt
they go up the up escalator
now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers
ok but remember that they wear it because they have to
i wear it because i want to
thatll make me look different
lets get a drink
ben somehow gets on the down escalator leaving sera on the higher level
ben needs a drink badly but this is not the best place
mothers with children old people and a waitress with attitude
ben tries to order but becomes angry when she doesnt bring it straight away
people begin staring
at the next table a dignified older man sits alone
ben hands sera a small package
there was no time for me to write a card with you breathing down my neck all day
so youll just have to wing it baby
he laughs and this induces a coughing fit
he downs his drink and holds up the empty glass to let the waitress know she should bring another
she does so
it is a pair of onyx earrings
black onyx set in white gold
pleased your color
i think you should wear one at a time
one of these
and one of your others
in fact i was going to buy just one but i didnt think it would fly
as a gift i mean
his new drink arrives and he takes a swallow straight away
ill wear them tonight
one of them
she looks at him aware of what she has said wondering how he is reacting
she smiles and ben takes a deep swallow finishing his drink
his mood suddenly changes
put it on
she does so
ben helps her bringing his face down close to hers
youll be able to feel it sharp and hot under your ear as one of the brothers is driving your head face down into one of the penthouse pillows
they are both suddenly deeply shocked by what he has said
they sit in silence for a while
sera is close to tears
ben gets up suddenly puts down a couple of bills and walks away from the table
when he is almost at the door sera gets up and quickly tries together up all of the packages
please wait for me
the dignified older man stands in bens path and places his hands on bens shoulders
maybe you should wait for her sir
you can hear in her voice that she really wants you to
sera catches up and the man lets go of ben
ben takes the packages from sera and the two of them step out into the mall
they walk together
what was that all about
can we just forget it
i dont understand any of that
can we just ignore it
they stop and look at each other
the pa system gives an inane message
ill give you that
thank you sera
do you want me not to go tonight
we already talked about that
sera is preparing for work
in the background we can hear the tv next door
she dresses carefully
black underwear stockings heels a tight black skirt
ben is watching tv and drinking
sera at the mirror putting on her make up
her make up is more pronounced than we have seen it before
everything is more extreme
sera comes into the room
ben looks up at her and sucks in his breath
she walks over to him and takes his head and places it between her breasts and kisses the top of his head
maybe i should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what its like to sleep with you
they wouldnt know
she comes on to him
maybe you should ask me sometime
id be happy to show you
she goes to the door
ill be back home around three
if youre back by then we can watch tv or something
i guess what im saying is
that i hope you are back when i get home
please be careful
you be careful to
im going to miss you
shall we go away for a couple of days
id like that
sera walks through the lobby looking for business
ben lying down with people walking past and over him
a big smile appears on his face
he starts to laugh
a blue car drives across frame
the sun is bright
sera is a very good swimmer and we see that ben must have been quite an athlete
they look at each other under water
theyre under water for a long time
sera pushes him towards the surface
ben and sera come to the surface
ben has swallowed water and has a coughing fit
sera hugs him until the fit passes
the camera moves in tighter on them and music gives the moment a strange chill
dont do that to me
dont frighten me like that
ben and sera are watching the tv next to the poll
they are sitting in reclining chairs
inn the distance a coyote howls
years ago in la i turned a trick on sunset and western
the guy was polite and didnt argue about the price
he parked his car and i took him to a house that i had an arrangement with
a fat mexican woman was watching a tv and i told him to give her the twenty for the room
there were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room
the room had a bed and a dresser
he lay on his back on the bed and i put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then i eased on
about twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up
i felt kind of guilty because he hadnt come and i offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes but he said it was all right and
when we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and
hugged me and kissed me on the cheek
he gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car
i remember being relieved that i wouldnt have to work again that evening
last spring i happened to walk past a house that i had once patronized
there was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window i could see a bare leg
the girl must have been taking a break between customers
it was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that i was late for something already i just stayed there loving
the atmosphere of it and my memory and
the reason im telling you this epilogue is that i felt that id come full circle
where was that house
the one in la i mean
fifth and mayflower
you know it
one of my friends was there
i wonder if you ever clipped her
they watch the tv in silence for a while
sera holds his hand
i like it here with you
lets stay for a while
ben mixes a cocktail for himself then one for sera
the camera follows him as he goes
to the side of the pool where sera is sunbathing
he lowers himself unsteadily into the chair but avoids spilling a drop of the drinks which he puts down on to a glass topped table
he is pretty loaded
sera turns over and moves out of his shadow
ive missed the best sun
why did you have to pawn your watch
i didnt know id ever need it again
sera gets up takes a drink and then walks to the diving board
as she takes a position at the end she pulls the bathing suit out from her bottom does a very natural dive into the pool swims a length under water
and then comes out near ben pulls herself out of the pool in one move and bends down and kisses ben for a long time
ben responds and kisses back
there is no one else around the pool
the kiss becomes heated and urgent and sera sits on ben making him wet from her
he pushes the top of her suit down and kisses her breasts
she picks up the glass and drinks letting the alcohol spill from her mouth over her breasts
ben drinks from her
take this off
he tries to pull her swimsuit down
maybe we should go inside
she stands up covering herself
ben stands up laughing loses his balance and slips on the wet concrete
he falls backwards half on to the chair which he breaks and then on to the glass table
the table goes over and it and the glasses all shatter on the concrete
ben falls on the broken glass and cuts himself all over his back and his arms
glass goes into the pool
blood mingles with the water on the steaming cement
sera picks up her towel and lays it down next to him
she kneels and helps him up trying to pullout the little bits of glass sticking to him
ben stands unsteadily
ill go and clean up
perhaps you could take care of this
he indicates the mess then walks to their room
sera begins carefully picking up the broken glass
the desk clerc appears with a broom and a dustpan
cheerfully everybody ok
well pay for the chair and ill clean all this up the pool too
he begins sweeping the broken glass into the pan cheerfully ignoring sera
you seem prepared for accidents
still smiling yeah
we get a lot of screw ups here
he looks directly at sera
now you two keep you loud talk and your liquor to your room
check out first thing tomorrow and after that i dont want to see either of you here again
i dont need you paying for the chair or cutting your pretty hands on the glass
lets leave it at that
nodding firmly he goes back to the mess indicating that the conversation is over
see ya in the morning
sera comes into the room
she sees that he is already asleep on the bed his half naked body covered with countless bits of bloodstained tissue
the image has an almost religious feel to it
the tv is on and a sitcom is playing
something funny catches seras attention
she laughs and sits on the bed next to ben
sera voice over i think we realized that we didnt have long and accepted it
my charm for him was that i accepted him exactly as he was and didnt expect him to change
i think we both realized that about each other
ben needed me and i liked his drama
i loved him
we see las vegas lighting up
the blue rental car passes through frame and drives towards the town
ben wakes from a dream
he is fully clothed and very agitated
sera is cooking
im in here
you probably dont want to hear about it right now but i bought some plain rice
i thought it might be something you could eat
so if you get hungry later on just let me know
ben comes in from the kitchen and takes vodka bottles from the fridge
bens hands are sweating and its difficult for him to keep hold of the bottle as he drinks
he gets most of it down and then he hunches over the sink and immediately vomits
he takes the second bottle and tries again
still holding the bottle ben stands in the shower
he drinks some more and closes his eyes
ben enters smartly dressed and smiling
i think im ready for the rice
ben and sera sitting opposite each other
he has a bowl of rice which he is pretending to eat in between sips of vodka
she has a bowl of vegetables and rice
she sits silently for a while and then puts down her chopsticks
youre pretty sick
ben looks away
what are you going to do
she folds her arms
i want you to go see a doctor
he thinks for a while and then turns to meet her gaze
they look right into each others eyes
im not going to see a doctor
sera continues to look at him almost defiantly
maybe its time i moved to a hotel
and do what
rot away in a room
becoming angry were not going to talk about that
i will not talk about that
youre staying here
you are not moving to a hotel
will you lighten up please
close to tears one thing
this is one thing you can do for me
ive given you gallons of free will here
you can do this for me
she leans right forward
lets face it
sick as you are im probably the only thing thats keeping you alive
she stands up i have to go to work now
ben doesnt say anything
he just stares a hole in his bowl of rice
ben walks by himself
he is deep in thought
ben recklessly bets two hundred dollars at the craps table
as he leans forward to collect his winnings he sees
a blonde in a very low cut outfit
she smiles at ben and walks around the table to pick him up
ben puts all of his winnings on one bet and wins again
this pattern repeats a few times and drinks are on the house
that was quite a play
you in for the convention
ben gets to the point
id like to fuck you
a few people hear ben and the blonde is almost put off but he does have about eight thousand dollars in winnings and so she leans in very close so
that she can talk quietly
im very expensive
how much to lick your pussy
the blonde picks up a sizeable stack of chips and looks at ben
sera lets herself in looks around and opens the bedroom door
in one fluid movement the naked blonde gets off the semi conscious ben pulls her dress over her head and walks past sera
moments later we hear the front door slam
ben comes to and looks at sera
he is more or less unaware of what has just happened
her eyes are wet
there are limits
i guess i knew that
ben gets out of the bed
he picks up the bottle on the bedside table and stands
perhaps i could crash on the couch for a few hours
and then ill leave
he walks out of the room and closes his the door
camera moves in on sera
she covers her face with her hands
she drops her purse and slides down the wall to the floor weeping quietly
o i heard the door slam a couple of hours later and he was gone
ben coming out of a liquor store with a large brown bag
sera getting out of a car
the car drives off
sera examines her face in a pocket mirror
puts on more lipstick
ben is on all fours in the bathroom trying to vomit
his thin frame is heaving
three college boys with beer bottles walk the the strip
they are all wearing the same numbered jersey
nice middle class boys looking for an adventure
they see sera and go into a huddle before walking over to her
how much will it cost us to fuck you
the other two college boys titter
sera starts to walk away and then hesitates
sorry guys but i dont know what you mean
anyway i never date more than one guy at a time
we got money
show her the money
the other college boy gets out his wallet and opens it to show her
sera hesitates not somehow comfortable with the situation then goes ahead
how much of that money did you guys want to spend
how much you want
how about two hundred for an hour
becoming annoyed with them dont your friends talk
no answer try three hundred for a half hour
nervous three hundred for the hour
and well see how it goes
where are you staying
the yukon room twenty four
ill see you there in fifteen minutes
you can pay me then
why dont you all take a shower while youre waiting
in fifteen minutes
ill only need one of you at a time
the other two can shower while im there
they walk off in a huddle giggling three small boys
sera drinks from a beer bottle as she approaches their room
she talks to herself
where are the boys this weekend frank
why hell charlie i sent em off to learn the one thing i couldnt teach em
she looks at the numbers and finds the room
she knocks and a moment later the tallest college boy opens the door in his jockey shorts
sera steps in
one boy is coming out of the bathroom wearing a towel and the third is sitting in a chair smoking a cigarette which he passes to the boy in the
the other boy is fooling around with a video camera
the atmosphere is weird and sera is suddenly alert
the tallest college boy hands her the money
he is very well built a football player
sera hesitates holding the money
the tallest college boy closes the door and then leans against it
they are all staring at her now
no one says anything
sera smiles suddenly and puts the money in her purse
wheres the bedroom and whos first
they all look at each other
i want to fuck her in the butt
he looks at the other
you too right
no ones doing that
youll all go one at a time
i f you want ill suck you instead but thats all
then im out of here
looking at tallest you said i could fuck her in the butt
shouting its my fucking money thats it
take your money back
the smallest college boy gets off the bed and comes over to sera
the tallest boy is still standing in front of the door and things are getting strange
the other boy turns on the video camera
sera loses her cool
to the smallest boy maybe youd like to fuck one of your friends in the butt instead
the room goes very quiet
the kid tears up
sera tries to back pedal
the kid punches her hard in the stomach knocking her to the ground
close up on seras face pushed into a bloodstained pillow her body being pounded from behind
the naked legs of two of the boys behind her
we hear voices filtered from a long way off
fuck her ass
look at me
look at me
look at me
a hand comes into frame and pulls her head up by the hair
a pair of legs moves in
there is the sound of a punch
seras body on the floor
in the background trousers being hastily pulled on to legs
the boys exit with sport bags
the last one turns out the lights and closes the door
in the half light sera gets up and walks with difficulty to the bathroom
she clicks on the mirror light
her face is awful
one eye is swollen almost shut
her top lip is cut
sera gets into the cab with considerable difficulty
the cab driver is a cynic
whats the matter honey get a back door delivery you werent expecting
you gonna be able to pay the fare
without speaking she takes out a twenty leans forward and drops it on the front passenger seat
looks at her in the mirror
oh dont wanna talk to me unh
well dont take it out on me im just covering my ass
what the hell do you expect stuttin around like that
dressed like that
you oughta be glad the creep didnt nail ya
as the cab drives off sera walks slowly to the door
her landlords wife passes and takes in her face
sera is slumped on the floor of the shower her arms hugging her legs the water pounding down on her
sera opens the door and we see the landlord
behind him on the sidewalk we can see his wife
he is embarrassed
sera wearing dark glasses
she looks terrible
her mouth is swollen and some of the bruising around her eye is visible
but wed like you out by the end of the week
sera gets out of a cab and goes into reception
she is wearing huge dark glasses to hide the black eye and the bruising
the desk clerk is wearing a shirt of bens that we recognize from an earlier scene
im sorry maam
he never checked back in
sera walks alone
shes dejected as she looks for ben
sera comes to an elevator and waits
she is wearing a thin black top without a bra
her bruised face makes her suddenly very conspicuous and vulnerable
a big man in a white stetson stands next to her
he looks at her and grins
she smiles coldly
he takes from his pocket two black hundred dollar chips places one in each hand and deliberately places each one against her nipples
other people see this and stop and watch
sera looks down at his hands and stares until the man becomes uncomfortable
whats the problem honey
you on strike
and he walks away laughing
sera is sitting on a freshly painted red kerb
she smokes a cigarette and doesnt give a damn that her short skirt is somewhat revealing
opposite her a bum is sleeping on the pavement
for a moment it looks like ben
the camera comes in tight on to her face
she looks more lost that weve ever seen her
she drinks coffee from a styrofoam cup
the sun is bright and hot and traffic is noisy
sera comes in and the camera follows her as she makes her way to the bar
she has covered up much of the bruising with make up but it is still pretty obvious
in wide shot we see her strike up a conversation with the man next to her at the bar
a hand comes in to shot and grips her arm firmly
we see that it is a casino security guard
whats the problem
we dont want you in here thats the problem
and he jerks her arm
people are watching now
if you dont want me in here then i dont want to be in here
just let go of my arm and ill walk out of here
well both walk out now
he steers her firmly across the floor
they reach the sidewalk and without relaxing his grip he grabs her between the legs with his free hand and says in her ear next time it wont be so
and he pushes her towards the street and walks back into the casino
sera is shocked
she looks around and the group of people who have stopped to watch the event move away
sera is throwing clothes into a suitcase
the phone rings
she thinks about it for a long time and then it stops
she carries on packing and then the phone rings again
she pick it up
suddenly alert ben
where the fuck are you
give me the address
the driver is black and friendly
the radio drones quietly a religious program
ike is taking listeners calls
what in the hell happened to you miss
it was an argument
leave him miss
pretty girl like you could get any man that you wanted
the door opens
ben is naked
his body looks bad
leaving the door open he retreats to the bed
sera comes in closing the door behind her
the shades are drawn and the room is gloomy
ben has got back into bed
she comes to the bed and sits
ive been looking for you
have you been here since you left
it smells bad in here
its so dark
she clicks on the bedside light and is truly shocked by his face
i wanted to see you
you look so very sick
youre so pale
she goes to the bathroom and returns with a wet face cloth
she wipes his face
i wanted to see you
youre my angel
he sits up painfully and finds a bottle summoning up some last strength to drink
his entire body shudders as he drains the bottle
he puts it down and focuses on her for the first time
h sees her damaged face touches her face looks at her questioningly
something went wrong
im ben begins to cry and that sets her off
im sorry i put us asunder
she shakes her head unable to speak for the moment
she gets into bed with him kissing his face
she caresses his whole body which is shaking possessed by an uncontrollable fever
see how hard you make me angel
she excites him with her hand kissing his face gently
when he is about to come she straddles him and brings him inside
as he comes he opens his eyes wide and looks at her
you know i love you
she comes yes
sera is sleeping
a sudden gasp wakes her
ben is having a spasm
suddenly his body relaxes
he turns his head opens his eyes wide and looks straight at her
im so sorry
he smiles and turns his head away
he is very still
in the darkened room we can just make out sera sitting on the bed looking at the still form of ben
a paramedic van goes past with its lights flashing
the soundtrack is empty silent
we slowly fade in theme music and titles start to roll
