written by cameron crowe shooting script we hear a whooshing sound getting louder
new york city from a perspective of flight not an airplane a swooping diving shot
back to black
abre los ojos
open your eyes
open your eyes
david aames jr
swings out of bed and sits on the corner of his mattress
its a chilly new york city morning
early sunlight glows around the corners of his curtains
open your eyes
he reaches behind him to shut off a slim voice activated clock radio
he rises a comforter draped around his shoulders and heads to the bathroom
david regards himself in the mirror of a beautifully tiled and well appointed bathroom
in his thirties now his looks have only deepened and improved
he brushes his teeth
he spots a gray hair and holding tweezers seizes and plucks it
david puts on a shirt
checks his wallet for money
his bedroom is elegant and spare
he slips down the stairs into the expansive living area of this deeply textured apartment
a stunning inherited book collection lines the walls
david starts up his dark green sports car and roars onto the new york city streets
new york side streets u morning david travels the side streets to work
he senses a growing weirdness
the streets are empty
he looks at
he continues anxiously
runs a red light
the most recognized piece of real estate in the world is silent
it is as if the worlds biggest parade has just left taking everybody with it
david pulls over haphazardly
he exits the car leaving it in the middle of the street
he begins to walk faster now as music rises
all the electricity is on
there is absolutely nobody in sight
david begins to run searching for humanity
the billboards electronic and still all sell easy solutions to his loneliness
he pulls up short
stopping and crying out in anguish
there is no one left in the world
open your eyes
open your eyes david
david hangs out of bed his mouth in an open silent scream
covers his face with both hands
open your eyes
he reaches behind to shut off the same clock radio and its voice
he makes a relieved agonized sound into the pillow
gets up sees a pizza box
a container of soup
a remote control on the floor
we hear an incisive voice with a comforting lilt a man well meet later
well i suppose the empty street meant loneliness
youre a shrink
youve got to do better than that
im a doctor
lets not stereotype each other
not all rich kids are soul less and not all psychologists care about dreams
the question is how you got here and why youve been charged
what do you want to know
i was about to turn
i ran three magazines and a world wide publishing house
on most days i actually fooled myself into believing it would last forever
david checks himself in the mirror
seizes and plucks that same gray hair
isnt that what being young is about
believing secretly that you would be the one person in the history of man who would live forever
david enters reaching for his wallet repeating the morning ritual
a figure stirs in the bed behind him
she leans upward wearing davids college basketball tank for a pajama top
shes warm and wicked a mildly reformed party girl the kind of girl first novels are written about
she is julianna gianni
where you going so early
slightly self conscious hey dont record any more messages on my alarm clock okay
ill think were married or something
dont you ever say that word
or ill never come over here and bring you chicken soup and fuck your brains out again
exiting from other room hows your cold
i guess you took my mind off it
she pulls a pink pill box purse from the nightstand withdraws a multi colored phone
reyna its julianna
i missed my audition
dramatic like bette davis i lost my head
listen i have to go
whispers im with david
david in his steel and linoleum bachelor kitchen
julie swings into view
her blouse is unbuttoned two buttons too many down to mid chest
she gives him a kiss on the cheek and lingers
david grabs a racquetball bag talks to the next
help yourself to whatever you want
set the alarm maria will clean up
lock up when you go
you are the greatest
ill call you later
they have a comfortable healthy mutually satisfying gloriously superficial relationship
david is about to enter the green sports car then thinks better of it
he fires up a knock around beater car from his collection
he drives into the street which is comfortingly now full of people
we hear r
s all the right friends
david drives the crowded streets
it all seems more poignant today
life is good again
david pulls up to a lower end apartment checks his watch
enter the hung over brian shelby ish
in a world of acquaintances brian is a true friend
he has all the qualities of abe lincoln and much to his chagrin the looks too
he hops in the car with racquetball bag
did you reserve the court
i cant handle heavy conversation at this ungodly hour
im sorry to do this early
i gotta be done by
car phone rings
david checks caller id its his office
he clicks on
youre not going to make the are you
how did you find me
david aames you have to check the colors of the letters for the new issue of rise
what are the colors
yellow and red
or the traditional white
let me think about it
dont be late for the ten oclock with the board
dont tell anybody where i am i dont care if god calls
im very busy
cant you just get rid of that board
the seven dwarves
those people drive you nuts
and that was the desire of my father who hired them
suspicious pause you fucked julie gianni again didnt you
david takes off driving
i know someone was there when i called
you had that tone
imitates nasal phone voice oh no man ive got a cold
im hanging in tonight
shaky defense i had a cold
i was alone
you can do whatever you want with your life thanks
but one day youll know what love truly is
its the sour and the sweet
and i know sour which allows me to appreciate the sweet
anni is a friend
sometimes we sleep together
brian howls in pain like a hurt dog
what my dream girl
brian emits another pained howl
david reaches over to change the music
what do you want to listen to
slow down man
what have we got here barcelona looper
brian freezes at what he sees
david turns and sees hes hurtling into the back of a car stopped just in front of him
clenching he hits the brakes narrowly avoiding a high speech collision
to his right
another car comes hurtling toward him
and stops within an inch of deadly impact
there is an awful moment as the second car blares on the horn
traffic continues but the lingering feeling of dread and confusion is still in the air
annoyed we almost died
my own death was right there in front of me and you know what happened
your life flashed before my eyes
how was it
almost worth dying for
pedestrians continue walking around the honking tangled mass of the near
david meets peter brown and rachel his second assistant at
the front of the well appointed headquarters of aames publications
aames hops out of car and heads into the building
david aames jr
turns down the corridor of rise magazine a male youth culture style magazine
rachel gives him daily tabloid reports continues with the essentials
the art department needs a decision on the colors
yellow and red or white
and the board is pissed youre late
you changed your hair
david taps on the window of the art department in panic over several cover mock ups
he gives a presidential thumbs up moves on
they look at each other trying to decipher if the thumbs up was a decision
did he mean the yellow and red or the white
david passes a holdover from the old days older receptionist beatrice who speaks uncomfortably and gruffly into a headset
she gives david a knowing look late again
theyre all waiting for you
and david opinions are expected
do you dream about the board david
the seven dwarves as you call them
david walks into the office
framed original photos from album covers co mingle with a splash of cultured art and books
seven very interested and very alert looking older executives wait
sneezy bashful sleepy happy doc dopey and of course grumpy
skeptical how was aspen
playful mock drama good
now i want answers and i want them now
pause hows it going
he gestures charmingly easily and bows with apology over his lateness
all are happy to see him
they still look at me like i was still eleven years old
david at blithely skateboarding the hallways
he passes beatrice who turns to an editor
hes going to inherit everything
he gets it all
if the light from a small line of chicken wired windows cuts through the blackness
in the shadows of this dank room we hear his voice but we do not see him
it is the smaller slightly muffled tone of david aames
in the shadows he wears a mask
youre scared of your dreams arent you
portrait of curtis mccabe
doctor of psychiatry prison division
hes far too wily to spend the currency of his brilliance just yet
its too early in their relationship
he stands tall leaning on a steel desk polishing his glasses with end of his coat
its a nightmare either way
is that how do you explain whats happened to you
what what happened to your face
im not talking to you anymore
and you dont want to show me your face
do you know why youre here
sarcastic the conversation the coffee david the part where we parry and joust and get to know each other bit by bit
were going to have to skip it
youve been charged with murder
in four weeks a judge will determine your fate based on what i write
you will talk to me there is no murder
it didnt happen
i dont have to talk to anybody
a contentious prison guard aaron swings his feet down and gets up from watching a inch television on a stool
he exits into the bigger room to quiet down david aames
slight push in to show the television show he is watching and we see a snippet of to kill a mockingbird
you want me to help get the fuck away from me
take it easy sunshine
get the fuck away from me
take it easy face
your whole story is full of holes
with great power mccabe advances on the guard
his presence when he turns on the switches is considerable
ill take responsibility
whispering exiting im gonna get you daddys boy little freak
my parents are dead you fuck
the contentious guard leaves
is it true
sing song good cop
that youre a daddys boy
in darkness by rote primer on david aames senior
my father was not built for the st century
he never ate at mcdonalds not once and never watched television
yet his biggest magazine is still tv digest
he and my mother threw the grandest parties of the literary world
he ballooned jumped from planes sought adventure
his autobiography is the manual for every cutthroat publisher in new york
its called defending the kingdom
ive read it
david junior was a delight as a child
did i miss something here
is that all he wrote about you
i dont think he ever got over the fact that i was terrified of heights
and when he and my mother were run over by a drunken teenager on new years eve ten years ago
david aames moves closer to the light
we see a strange bland expression of his mask at first other worldly
and then more clearly
he left the keys to the kingdom to me
control going to a group of seven board members who all thought they were first in line
and you believe the board the seven dwarves put you here to take control of your company
what do you care
were just talking
and tonights wednesday night and i go to black angus for dinner with my daughters on wednesday nights so ill have to leave soon
you understand that our time is limited dont you
if i talk youll just think im crazy
mccabe gathers his things
with all the respect i can offer a man wearing a latex mask and spouting conspiracy theories david trust me youve crossed that bridge
enjoy your dinner
somehow the lilt in mccabes voice draws him closer
there are five basic emotions in life
what emotion gripped
before he entered that cell
was it guilt
there is no answer just a rustling and a growing sense of anticipation in the darkness
still no answer
mccabe now shows the invisible skill with which he has brought his client to the precipice
and now with one word he invites david aames to look over
in the darkness a rustling and the slight turn of a head
im completely on the wrong track arent i
from the darkened back room david aames appears with ice and re enters his party
who needs ice
aames moves swirls is more like it through into his party which is nicely underway
part literary crowd
part fashion crowd
hes great in a crowd
surrounded by people david aames comes alive
catching the attention of a model
jesus you have the greatest taste in shoes ive ever seen
a woman caterer in whites emma slips by with a knowing smile
the old place sure looks more crowded with people in it
emma do you know lynette
no but i shudder to think what
we might have in common
david notices that brian shelby has arrived with a guest a woman who struggles with a package and a very large coat
on first glance shes just another girl
on second glance shes a killer
he notes her oddly funny behavior
she removes the coat to reveal a very simple natural beauty
she is sofia serrano a year old city girl with a barely containable life force
enter peter brown davids male assistant with surreptitious headset
he gestures to a stereo appliance set up in davids living room
the living stereo system is online and looking great
its an amazing prototype
theyd love an article on it if you like it
david nods still focused on sofia
suddenly he finds he cant take his eyes off her
and happy birthday sir
as david arrives to greet brian and his guest
happy birthday and all the usual shit people say to each other
how you doing
livin the dream baby
livin the dream
the two friends hug
david shares a quick glance with brians date who still burdened with coat
to sofia as in meet the notorious
meet david aames
cant help but flirt and to what do i owe this pleasure the pleasure of playful the pleasure of sofia
we met today at the library if you can believe that im sorry about my coat
its too big for your closet
we were both pretending to be intellectuals
no no i think its amazing
i love your coat
i mean i underdressed
ill just continue like youre both actually listening to me
to david do you have another room to put it in
invisible re their chemistry i have ceased to exist
well madison square garden is nearby it might fit there
shoves david playfully as in touche happy birthday
her upbeat physicality is intoxicating
sofia hands david her present
we picked it out together
neither look at brian
brian takes a breath
hes been here before
we picked it out together
stop flirting and open it
lets get a drink
ill leave this upstairs
they are left to consider his personal charisma
an odd and disarmingly beautiful display of coltrane performing my favorite things in davids living room
sofia passes a hand through coltranes image admires it
david is approached by thomas tipp a brit and an associate board member at aames publications
tipp is ten years older than david and he is the rarest of birds
a sentimental lawyer
and at the moment hes a bit drunk
david moves to address him so he can still track sofia
listen to me
dont blow me off
im all packed im going back to london and i understand
you put me up for that other attorneys job so you didnt have to fire me
a classy move and your father would have done the same its okay tommy i became incompetent
is there anything more unbecoming than an aging mascot
i cared about your father
i lived and breathed for him
but these guys the board they think youre stupid
a corporate hazard a rogue
but the word stupid is what david heard loudest of all
nearby we see a woman partner one of the seven dwarves taking a quick look at david
but theyre going to find a way to get you out
theyre lined up for your office david scans the room
beneath the good cheer he sees the other layer
all part of the institution he enjoys forgetting exists
each word bashes his soul
they are working day and night
to cheat you out of your vote
and they are going to sell this tradition this tradition of words so they can eat at a better cafeteria
and what they dont know is this gestures grandly to books that surround them people will read again
davids gaze falls upon sofia who is looking directly at him
and for one blinding moment something passes between them
she looks away
he feels saved
interrupting with finality i got it
they even have a nickname for you behind your back
david smiles faintly
tipp kisses him on the cheek boldly and drunkenly
he feels like a hero to himself
david flinches just a little
now youve got great instincts
but i say this with complete love
claim your life
learn to be an asshole
dont be extracting himself twos enough don t be immediately okay
i still believe in this family
even if its only you
david continues tracking sofia as he slips over to peter brown
get tipp out of here drive him home and in the morning tell him hes re hired with a raise
set up a meeting with the other attorneys
im going to be in early tomorrow a look from peter brown earlier than usual
david enters shuts the door and sets sofias present down
a party dress is on his bed
he turns to see julie gianni in the bathroom doorway wrapped in a comforter
ive come to wish you happy birthday
i didnt invite you julie
yeah that was a little weird but thats how it works with parties
you have to be invited
im mad at you you dick
we made love four times the other night
is that good
two is good
three is very good
but four fishing for a compliment four is pretty good
no four is
just hold me
four is what
hold me and then ill leave and you can go talk to that cute brunette
four is what
i dont want to meet your fancy friends
i knew em all back when i was fancy too
he holds her
they talk in between friendly kisses
four is what
she pulls away and talks plainly to him
she looks like a moth david
sometimes i worry about one of these clever girls in a big silly coat wholl play you in just the right way and ill lose my friend
and therell be no more chicken soup parties for you and me
she kisses him again
david very gently and skillfully resists
she gets the message
when will you call me
and dont say soon
i hate it when you say soon
sofia eyes a framed smashed guitar handsomely mounted in a glass display case
so this is whats become of rock and roll
a smashed guitar behind a glass case displayed on some rich guys wall
it was a gift actually
she turns and sees its david engaging smile in place
she jumps slightly
apologetic i like it
she turns and walks away david following close behind
whoa whoa whoa
how did you get all this stuff this apartment this life david is looking just over her shoulder
she turns to see an almost disturbingly large portrait of david aames sr
she turns back
how about if you help me
unless im horning in here
you are but the foods good
playful like a spy see ive got a little problem
ive got a stalker
sound life threatening
someone passes bumping her slightly into him
i need a cover
i need for you to pretend were having a scintillating conversation
and youre wildly entertained
i know its tough
ill improvise shes right across the room and shes burning a hole in my back right now isnt she
red dress strappy shoes
yes beat jarred wow shes really staring at you
and she seems to be growing
i think shes the saddest girl to ever hold a martini
julie gianni sits on the steps watching
the girl and the dress looked much happier in the bedroom
julie rises and begins to move
brian holds a drink attempts to crash a conversation between two models
his debonair act is shaky
david and sofia race up the stairs
bad kids having fun
you have another apartment
sort of a day office
come on they arrive at the door to a smaller upstairs apartment
im not going in there
well i am
he enters and shuts the door
frustrated she stands for a moment listening to the music streaming from the downstairs apartment
we watch her private moment as she decides to leave him turns feels the emotional pull dances back and knocks sharply three times
i hear her coming
david pulls her inside
shuts the door behind them
julianna and brian both looking for david discover each other
artwork on the walls
sofia is drawn to a powerful monet
and it is not a copy
and ive got nothing to drink
who did these paintings
this is joni mitchell
this one is monet
and this one is done by me
as a tour guide it is a snowboard
well two of them are geniuses
laughs off the monet its the real thing
his paintbrush painted that vanilla sky
was my mothers
julianna and brian hold their private conversation by a piano
they are bonded almost mesmerized by their mutual fascination for david
david and sofia laugh
you know what i think
youre either a very good actress or you really do sort of like me
i am an actress
theres probably not too much you arent great at
are you about to compliment my phone voice
its pretty good you know oh id only disappoint you
see im not
i can spell
im surprised youre available
im surprised youre surprised
i cant keep this banter going
they drop the act
a powerful awkward moment
and the door opens
i caught you
come in here
whats going on your friends are fun and im drunk
cheerful julie gianni is stalking me
she looked dangerous
nobody stalks me
so i drink
well were out of drinks up here
here finish my jack and coke
he messily tries to hand his drink to david but spills it embarrassingly
all his cool is gone and whats left are his friends covering for him cleaning up
these stupid glasses no its the stupid guy holding it
embarrassed dont worry
us all something
jacks and cokes
she exits leaving the two friends
i better hit it
i drank too much and i didnt fucking eat
dont be stupid
the partys just starting
moving away for you it is
you cant go
youre my guest of honor
fuck you david
youre paying me to write my novel so you own me
i dont own you
youre brilliant youre good looking youre handsome
but whyd you have to hit on sofia
no ones hitting on sofia
whatever you say

youre just drinking jack daniels
and when you drink jack you start
in with that frank sinatra she shot
me down gimme a cigarette king of sad thing

brianprepares to leave as sofia returns with drinks
where you going
i am frank
and frank must go
i good you bid evening
sofialooks at her watch and the situation
hang on ill go with you
ill give you a lift home later
no i have to work tomorrow

beat realizing its over im just humoring myself that my opinion matters
brian looks at the two of them
life is telling him and he knows its time to go
portrait of a man who will not get what
david notes the poetry in his friend
leans in close to david you will never know the exquisite pain of the guy who goes home alone
the bitter baby the sweet aint as sweet
have a good time
he exits like a champ a glorious sad sack with a hand flourish
the sweet and sour speech again
julie gianni dances her eyes closed her hand around a strange mans neck
they stand nervously out in front of her apartment
in the distance rain
a lot of people are scared of heights
its not the heights that bother me its the impact that terrifies me
off her look i wont stay long
it was never his decision to make
she switches the light on in an artfully messy city girl apartment
a life is lived here a bed on the back room floor a bag of trash on the counter lamp is askew
she makes no attempt to clean it up
he soaks in the details including some miniature dolls that occupy her kitchen and shelves
a large goofy dog comes running at her and then proceeds to slather david with love too
im glad he protects you
this is a lethal canine
from other room i love living here
and i refuse to clean up
ive got to work around the clock to keep this place
david eases the dog away as he examines the oddly exquisite dolls
he grabs a look at her in the other room
a bit of leg between boot and skirt
as he admires the dolls so youre really a dancer huh
but i dont dance like you dance
she laughs to herself steals a look at him
do you want something to drink
david looks at her refrigerator
a note reads call dad
an odd epiphany occurs as he sees the collage of photos that represent a hard working hard earned committed and passionate life
shot moves across the photos
a young girl living a young girls hard working and happy life
group photos of co workers
a few from a vacation
a whole new cast of characters all committed and they all look inviting to him
and one gloriously random photo of her in cabo san lucas raising a toast with friends
i like your life
well its mine and you cant have it
david examines a humorously embarrassing vacation photo of a sloshed sofia a guys arm reaching for her breast
dedication reads to sergio
i do not want to know the story behind this photo
its a nickname
your nickname is sergio
its a long story and we dont know each other
so many secrets
thats because im really an arms dealer
ive never known an arms dealer
you do now
what about you
whats your nickname
and then decides what the hell to tell the truth
youre not staying over
still stung over nickname never run a company
stay an artist
stay an arms dealer
somehow i cant play the violin for you
it must be hard controlling all those peoples lives
everyone at that party is connected to you for survival in some way it seems
david looks at her mentally assessing her level of guile
ever been married
ever accept any of your proposals
playful self deprecating
and you moved to new york
to dance and paint and act and deal arms
going through cds do you want to hear jeff buckley
or vikki carr
or vikki carr
he continues looking
flashes of the photos on her refrigerator
everyone said dont go to new york
but i just think good things will happen if youre a good person with a good attitude
he regards her
hes a little restless and a lot enchanted
is she for real
you think im naive
he decides shes for real
he turns back to the photos on her fridge
i really dont
i dug her completely
somehow i had found the last semi guileless girl in new york city
i have to get to sleep
truthfully im also working mornings as a dental assistant
to himself boy am i going to the wrong dentist
and you didnt immediately want to sleep with her
well you know im a pleasure delayer
interested in his romantic style how does that work
toying with the shrink pleasure delaying
you dont know
you keep the relationship casual until the absolute breaking point
and then one night or afternoon or morning
it could be months from now
oh you know how it works his vision moves across the bright blue sky of one of sofias photos
a single crimson cloud
david sits with the mask facing mccabe
mccabe is hanging on every word
actually no i dont
ive been married for twenty two years
ah youve got dinner with your daughters
back then i had intricate systems with women you wouldnt believe
dont get all melancholy over the thirty seconds you were single a long time ago
thats what you think im doing
well you may have a point
time is not our friend
aaron watches david a inch television on a stool to his right
again strangely it is to kill a mockingbird that hes watching
we hear audio from the movie through the glass
david with artists notebook in hand
across the table sofia holds the other notebook
just our shortcomings
thats all were allowed to draw
confidently ive never drawn such a true likeness before
sofia offers her drawing
its a caricature of a good looking guy surrounded by money cars and very thin girls
he snatches it studies it and what he sees hurts him in surprising ways
embarrassed laugh jesus
thats how you see me
maybe i didnt add enough money no
its something youd see on the wall of a steak house in hell but its wonderful
sofias face falls a bit
she sees shes hurt him
she takes the drawing and signs it a little guilty
lets see yours
she grabs it
its a rich portrait filled with detail humor and style
she is rocked by its elegance
i feel bad
regarding it carefully you said to draw a caricature
i saw you like that
well its very good
ill sell it to you
how much for
something is developing between them
that smile is gonna be the end of me
serious and what happens when your friend calls you tomorrow
he only met you a few hours before me
he would do the same
i see that friendship is important to you
but as his best friend i also know that hes trying to finish a novel about inadequacy and rejection
so the longer i stay the better it is for his career
sofia smiles shakes her head
your career is one id worry about
david looks down
shes hit a nerve
im sorry no no
youre more right then you even know
i used to be one of those guys who was just snowboarding through his life with no focus whatsoever
when did you change
pause confesses about five minutes ago
direct slightly whimsical every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around
david shakes his head a little
her words strike right to the heart of him
sofia is asleep on the sofa
clothes still on
david gently strokes her hair
television in b
its one of those late night infomercials and its ridiculously compelling
the perfect thing to bond over on a great lingering date
and to those who think that youre a charlatan
the perception of a head frozen somewhere waiting for reanimation it sounds like science fiction
what are you watching
its the greatest show
its called sofia
sofia looks at him and smiles
they look back to the television
a charming looking older man discusses eternal life with a television interviewer
ive seen this thirty times
we did a story on this guy
he owns half of arizona
is he a fraud
how would you ever know
can you unfreeze a human life
take the case of benny the dog
benny is a dog who was frozen for three months and thawed out to live a normal life
oh well thats comforting
its safe for benny
david moves closer to her
we better watch out
they regard each other and david gets up off the sofa
the promise is too great to not savor it and walk away for now
thrill remains in the air
where are you going
i left my number on your fridge
he makes a courtly bow and turns
she feels the loss of his company
come here i want to tell you a secret
he pauses a moment and turns
in this instant a fleeting instant its the oddest thing
he can see their entire life together
he returns to her
tentatively she grabs a quick sweet kiss on his mouth
he stays for an extra moment kissing just her upper lip leaving no doubt as to the potential of their future
very close she says i meant that to be your forehead
he looks around the small apartment
thank you for the inspiration
i will now attempt to run my company showing compassion for the seething throng of my partners who root quietly for me to fail
she looks at him quite aware of his personal and business crossroads
silently she roots for him like crazy
for things you dont even know thank you
im going to go to work
i have a company to run
he is still somewhat stunned by the evening and the girl
he actually wants to run his company
david slips out onto the street
its shabbier than the alluring night time version
hed never notice or care
because david is a man with a brand new buzz
the city is his
everything good and great suddenly feels inevitable
life feels like a great pop song
behind him a car with its lights still on starts and advances alongside
behind the wheel is julianna gianni
david leans on his car turns and shakes his head
youre following me
only a little
i wanted to finish what we were talking about
and howd it work out with our moth girl
did she turn into a butterfly for you
yes she did
but i can see from your walk that you didnt sleep with her
let me see if i can guess
you havent slept with her because
its more fun when you can draw it out
sex just isnt as good if the woman hasnt told all her friends shed never sleep with you
youre right on the money julie
she must be exhausted from trying to be witty for you all night long
youre just never there for your friends until theyve already given up on you
im not blowing you off
i just want to be alone for a little bit
trust me i have a lot of things i gotta take care of
if were friends which we are youll understand
simple honest im sorry i got weird
i missed an audition and i just felt bad you didnt invite me to your party
it zings him
david turns considers her
do you want to make it up to me
i wont tell a soul
slowly he is drawn to her
his old self rallies one last time
he gets in the car
the streets are empty
she plays a cd of a romantic sweet pop track with a feeble vocal
would you do a story about me if i made a cd
sure i would do you like my music
winning truthful its vivid
if i werent me i would buy a cd by me
well you know if you can reach one person
julianna is a little hurt hides it well
what is happiness to you david
considering what is happiness
for me this is happiness
being with you
david doesnt look at her
she speeds up slowly
one thing bothers me
why did you tell brian i was your fuck buddy
i didnt tell him that
i didnt say that
when did you stop caring
watching the road about what about the consequences of the promises you made
promises i thought we had an understanding
do you know how hard it is to pretend to be your buddy
i love you david
you fucked me four times in one night
you have been inside me and i have swallowed your come
that means something
four times david
that means something
he grabs at the wheel
she wont let go and speeds up
stop the car
she picks at things on the dashboard as she talks with a manic energy
twenty four hours a day i live with the aching possibility that you might call me to do something
pleading take me to your house
well talk this out
i want to see where you live
i want you to stop the car julie
i want you to stop the car
dont you know david
every time you sleep with someone
your body makes a promise whether you do or not
who turns slowly to face her
all he sees are haunted blue eyes
he knows at the very least there will be a crash
she guns the accelerator
he is paralyzed unable to alter his fate
tell me something david
do you believe in god
sweet pop music swells
she bursts the barrier of the winding road and the car sails into an embankment of a road below
all sound disappears as we hear a new kind of music
ethereal almost wondrous
this music continues
david walks the hall of trees
its the gentle seductive whoosh of a new day the way the world sounds when youre in love
ironically rich in the beauty we all take for granted when were not in love
he looks impossibly drawn forward to sofia who stands waiting to meet him
he steals a kiss
they both feel like theyre getting away with something
did you get to work alright
yeah well actually
i had a horrible dream
you dreamed youd never see me again
i left your house
i went to the car and my friend the stalker had been following me
she followed me down the street
she wanted to talk and i had that buzz
from you and me and i think my mind was on that terrible drawing of me
and you know i got inside
and she drove me off a bridge and committed suicide with me in the car
i thought you were going straight to work
but i survive
i survive with my arm and my face reconstructed
and whats worse i couldnt wake up
shushing how was your house after the party
i spilled something on your shirt
sweet and sour
and the saddest girl to ever hold a martini
he looks at her completely lost and spacy
my dreams are a cruel joke
they taunt me
even in my dreams im an idiot who knows hes about to wake up to reality
if i could only avoid sleep but i cant
the alarm clock goes off
a hand shuts it off
he looks at a model plane by the side of the bed
i try to tell myself what to dream
i try to dream that im flying something freeing
it never works
viewed in shadow he rises out of bed
is that the only thing that you dream
walking down a hallway a pretty woman with red hair beckons
on a motel floor david writhes in pain
i dont remember
do you dream about the car accident
he shuffles down the hall
david in the dark bathroom
he pauses and reaches slowly for the light
as in every previous occasion he has been revealed in the mirror
but today viewed over his shoulder we see that the mirror is now a wooden cabinet
heres what you remember from a coma
he shuffles down the hallway seen from behind a little heavier a wool cap on
there are no shiny surfaces around the house
what happened next
what really happened
what didnt you read the file
i was out for three and a half weeks
my face and arm were shattered
my jaw was broken in four places
no surgery could be performed because of the coma
you cant feel the darkness or the numbness you cant even feel
i came back to life
just like that dog benny
benny the dog
nods knowing benny
benny the dog
except my life was no longer normal
there were blinding migranes now
mccabe continues with david
this is how big business operates
a random accident
a lifestyle mishap
they are not coincidences
how do you think air tight contracts are broken
these are power upheavals
im from ohio we dont have power upheavals
and theyre in the news every day right
between the lines
someone did this to me
my father wrote this in his book you know
chapter one page one paragraph one
what is the answer to out of a hundred questions
david from behind on the phone
he strains to be casual
his head hurts
thomas tipp the drunk truth telling employee is on the phone
davids empty office in b
david david david
i dont want to worry you im holding them off
but weve got a situation here
the by laws of the board protect your vote only if youre mentally acute
now im sorry that poor girl died but youve given the board a real gift with your mishap
theyd like to declare you incapacitated
but you are back and you sound good to me a so lets fight the fuckers
and have a full recovery
and maybe you should let people see you
i mean the last time we were together you were in a coma and you were very fucking rude to me
you didnt say a word
camera reveals the extent of davids facial damage
yes well the rumors of my death have been mildly exaggerated
who could i trust
the ants were taking over the ant hill
who could i trust
sofia serrano walks down a new york street in sensible shoes
just another part of the working force
to our unseen follower she is most beautiful when unaware shes being watched
shot continues parallel to her
she stops sees someone she knows
a truck with several panes of glass passes by and stops in traffic
her image blurs behind the glass but visible to us in the window is david acmes
his healing face is dotted with stubble
he wears a wool hat
he looks noble an assembled victim a modern miracle
he looks like many things
but he no longer looks like david aames
the truck moves through frame
a dashing looking surgeon dripping with confidence dr
pomeranz talks with david
the cranial structure was based on thirty pins fastened by small panels and bits of bone from the mandible
and it seems the cartilage grafts have maintained your cheek structure
unfortunately because you were in a coma immediate plastic surgery was impossible
their power is in jargon
so you study up
is that the procedure for all bilateral periorbital hematomas in a lefort iii fracture of a comatose patient
pleasantly surprised in a lefort iii absolutely
the potential for sub cranial brain damage was too great
you do your best
david consults a list hes made
and beyond the cheek grafts dr
pomeranz is are the pins fastened with any kind of aluminum which could ionize and cause that pressure in my head
because im ready for another operation
three other doctors in the room listening
yes we are working on processes
youre specifically not at the stage where we can experiment experiment
the headaches will go away these are more than headaches
this is like a steel plate slicing through my every thought
were not cowboys
we cant just wing it
because i cant think straight most of the time
we can increase your medication
and there are things well continue to investigate
but there are so many others whove not been able to benefit aesthetically from plastic surgery as you have this isnt about vanity dr
keeping rage bottled this isnt about vanity
this is about functioning in the world
it is my job to be out there functioning
ive got the money and ill pay any amount
you say youre the best face man in new york city
fucking prove it
we could do something about your arm fuck my arm
pomeranz looks over to a young assistant
nobody here takes your feelings for granted
we did prepare something for you based on the preliminary examination
bring it on
its sometimes useful in the early stages of rejection
its a facial prosthetic
it was two weeks in the making
the assistant opens a black leather bound box
in it is the mask molded from davids own face locked into a pleasant bland expression
a facial prosthetic
the aesthetic replacement does work
emotionally and actually
helpfully and the plastic in the aesthetic shield also filters out abusive rays and assists in the regeneration of cells
so its an aesthetic regenerative shield
and the ergonomics of the plate barrier allows it to reflexively interact with the movements of your own face
i see its a helpful unit
because for a minute there i thought we were talking about a fucking mask
beat its only a mask if you treat it that way
no its great
this completely takes care of halloween
but what about the other days of the year
families lined up watching the ritual blowing up of the balloons the night before thanksgiving
parents hug children detailing the magical events of an autumn night
sagging balloons come to life a new form of me began to take shape
david by the window of his darkened apartment
the macys thanksgiving day parade passes just outside his window
the top of homer simpsons head floats by
we are a world away from the lively apartment that once hosted his swinging birthday party
i planned my re emergence like the normandy invasion
take out boxes catalog orders with new clothes comic books and magazines with ripped out pages fill the living room
a memo is placed on the floor of davids living room
shot pulls back to see he has covered the entire floor of his living room with memos and paperwork from aames publishing
he stands regarding all of this information stooped and wearing his bathrobe
david stands in front of the bathroom mirror practicing aloud
ill just say it i did my homework
i read every memo
thomas tipp was right
people will read again
david stares at his screen
disheveled in underwear he eats red vine licorice and m ms
i attended the monthly board meeting of the seven dwarves by video hook up
this was war
on screen before him all seven and thomas tipp too
shot moves in on screen
we can feel the cool tension of their imminent takeover
david twitches feels it physically
because nobodys buying books lets invest
my father was an adventurer
david sits in the middle of his office
push in on the white tape that covers the camera on the top of the monitors
david continues practicing aloud
i grew stronger in ways i had never known before
and on december th
my planes filled the sky
the return of david aames jr
sofia dances at the end of a long day
a few others leave for the day trying not to stare at david
sofia is there alone
for a moment we share her solitude
she practices ballet twisting and turning and landing in frame looking just past camera
she catches sight of david undisguised
and she begins dancing again
does she even recognize him
he moves closer attempting an easy going persona
we hear nothing but the sound of his heart pounding in odd counter rhythm to her dancing
finally she stops
you wont believe this
but this is me smiling
she laughs a little at his strange new humor keeps a brave front
its been a long time
i tried to see you but your people wouldnt let me
i didnt want to see me okay
but then i woke up today and finally a good hair day
david fights anxiety smoothes his coat
you want to go out you want to do something
convincing herself sure
lets go out and do something
ill cancel an operation or two
well have fun
because i am all about fun
she kisses his cheek pulls back quickly and as she exits
he sees her fighting tears
davids mirror is restored
he studies himself
raises his arm higher than he has been able to
in the next room we hear conan obrien welcoming please welcome benny the dog
david watches conan
the owner of benny sits with benny himself
he wears a t shirt reading l
benny is not the most excitable dog in town
in fact he seems rather spacey
i have so many questions
to start off tell us all just what has happened to benny
whats benny been through
benny fell into the water near our home and was frozen in the skykomish river
and i went fishing thinking hed gone three months earlier and there he was in a block of ice and
david grabs the phone and dials a number
off the dogs complacency he is thawed out right
laughter on the t
riding the buzz of what hes watching david dials
hey listen its david
im back in your life
i saw you earlier tonight
i was just watching our old friend benny the dog on
and i thought of you
i loved seeing you today
so ill see you soon
youre a great dancer
he hangs up and feels instantly mortified
he looks at the phone in his hand
david moves into the thick of a high energy neighborhood dance club
he wears a facial prosthetic
in the darkness he doesnt stick out not much
he spots sofia and brian chatting waiting for him
the sight of the two together recalls happier times
sofia is dressed down
brian on the other hand has never looked better
his clothes are nicer
he wears them with confidence
david has practiced an opening joke clapping his hands together
he will be trying too hard all night long
they regard him in the mask
a little too big hi
equally big hey
what are you drinking
i am in the mood for cheap sugary overpriced rum and cokes
you want one
spreads arms is there any other kind
ill go get us some wheres the bathroom
over by the place next to the door by the chick
i mean girl who looks like bjork
david turns to brian immediately
you look good man
hows your book
take it off
its a facial shield
its an antiseptic prosthesis to stop infections
these fucking doctors
with all love take off the mask
its freaking me out
its my face
this is my face
its a little different
hey if youre embarrassed just go
nobody asked you to chaperone sofia asked me
she didnt want to be alone with me
brian regrets his words thats bullshit
because i think im being pretty fucking cool about the whole thing
talk to a shrink
or you can call me sometime instead of hiding in your apartment
dont take it out on a girl you only met once
stung did she say that
i met her once
did she say i met her once
brian looks away
hes said too much
cut it out
i miss the old you
we all miss the old you
because the new guy is shit
david turns away
the perfectly wrong thing to say
that came out wrong
i love you period
hows your arm man
david shakes his head moves toward the bar
fuck you brian
how about no more sympathy
how about if thats the deal we make with each other
david shakes him off goes to the bar and rips off his mask
his head thuds from a migraine
gimme a budweiser and a shot of tequila
avoiding eye contact what kind of tequila
what did you say to me
leans closer still looking down i said what
why dont you ask me to my face bitch
the barman looks up expressionless
if you have it
watching sofia and brian from a distance talking as friends
another shot another bud
he throws bills on the bar
this is on the house
why odd compassion it just is
david looks across the club to see sofia
a clubgoer guy whispers something in her ear
she shakes it off
he pounds down another shot at the bar this time with the barman
david regards a video monitor behind the bar
someones camera is fixed on sofia dancing with brian and another good looking young man
she playfully shoves the good looking young man away not unlike the move that won david over lo those many nights ago at her apartment
he pounds back another drink
weaving at the urinal david pees
squeezes his temples to ward off a headache
dude fix your face
the clubgoers laugh
david laughs too
suddenly he feels better
david moves through the crowd powered by a new sense of belonging
the music swirls and takes him along with it
he dances wildly
in the strobing darkness he is anonymous moving with the group lost as one
david takes the mask and pulls it over his head backwards
in profile his two faces stare in opposite directions
david sees his moment
sofia is alone near the corner of the club
he approaches her
lets start all over
he regards her for a moment sees her apprehension and discomfort
how about if you help me
unless im horning in here beat does her you are
but the food is good
he continues taking a step
see ive got a little problem
ive got a stalker
does her it doesnt sound life threatening
does himself self deprecating i need a cover
i need for you to pretend were having a scintillating conversation and youre wildly entertained
i know its tough
does her with head nod ill improvise
a touch playful i dont talk like that
shes right across the room and shes burning a hole in my back right now isnt she
red dress strappy shoes
their heads are close together looking off into the club
david doesnt notice that sofia is having a hard time playing along with this game
she is overwhelmed holding it in
i think she s the saddest girl to ever hold a martini
about to burst david are you okay
is it me
ill tell you later
tell me now
tell me everything
lets talk about it right now
ill tell you in another life
when we are both cats
david looks at her
his eyes flash at her choice of words
perhaps there is hope
sofia stares at
him worried about his sanity as he goes overboard with his praise of her turn of a phrase
push into close ups as they struggle to deal with the discomfort of this moment
i dont believe you just said that
is the best thing ive ever heard
that is hilarious
god that just killed me
the way you said that
see thats what i love about you
ill tell you in another life when we are both cats
david brian and sofia walk swiftly down the street in silence
they are anxious to pretend it was a wonderful evening
well this is where i leave you
ill walk you to your door
no i live just around the corner
ive got my bike here
id rather walk
dont be a drag
cant you see she wants to go on her own
shut up youre drunk
i may be an idiot but im not drunk
seriously i dont need you to walk me home
well call you
well go catch a movie or something
well meet up soon
the word sounds a lot like goodbye and they both know it
well meet up soon
sofia turns and runs away
lacking all pride well call you again to go out with me
well call you
david and brian walk on
brian turns back to see sofia running to the corner
well its been a real blast david
i bid you good evening
where you going
its back over there
well hang soon
bring your mask if you want
im getting used to it
wait a minute
shrugs i dont know
you drank a little too much
call me tomorrow if you want
tomorrow ill wish i was dead
starts in sofias direction no you wont
you just need to sleep
brians itching to go what
what did you say to julie gianni the night of the accident
you told her she was a fuck buddy
and she was a little more than pissed about it
a little guilty have you been harboring this shit all along
i never talked to her
i mean who am i if i cant
be the one who tells you youre not ugly
aw give me a courtesy laugh
brian shakes his head starts running
im so fucked up
im just so fucked up
brian stops one last time irritated at the far end of the street
were best friends
brian needs to rid himself of david
he turns and runs in the direction of sofia
david feels the deep pangs of rejection
his head hurts
his body hurts
come on man were bros
he sprints down the middle of the street after brian
david runs frantically heartbroken and sobbing
brian catches up to sofia
she turns relieved
they kiss messily hungrily
her shoes arch to reach his height
david runs the streets nearing her home
the images are tearing his mind apart
he stops and leans against a car unsteady and nauseous
holding his head in pain he manages to run further
david stops on the street outside her apartment
his sobs overwhelm him
he drops to the pavement
he passes out mouth agape
the empty street visible in the b
his hand loosens its grip on the mask
open your eyes
open your eyes
david is passed out the mask is still clutched in his hand
a butterfly crosses frame
a hand enters resting on his shoulder
this is a cheap ploy for sympathy
david wakes up and looks into the kind face of julie gianni
his vision sharpens
in the morning shadows with increasing focus we see that it is actually sofia
no im okay sofia examines him with a look of concern and understanding
everything takes on a clear and sharp focus
behind her is a beautiful vanilla sky
and it worked
ugh helping him up thats right
this is a joke
touches his cheek david
im not going to lie to you
i liked the way you looked
but if you dont pull it together ill forget the other guy
you know that
other guy you
groggy im still that guy
im still that guy
sofia speaks with rapid fire conviction as if she might change her mind if she thought about it too much
have a mother savior bone in my body
its not about that
youre coming inside
but if this turns out to be a big mistake i do have the ability to fall out of love with you snaps fingers like that
she helps him up
i am still that guy
we created our own world together
them wheres brian
he went with you didnt he
shaking head at his own paranoia i thought you guys hooked up
she stops in profile with him
shes astonished at his jealousy
then raw truth i wish you hadnt gotten in the car with that girl
a long apology is coming sofia
she covers his mouth nose and face
only his eyes remain
your eyes apologized better
portrait of the two her leading him to the door the crisp glycerine morning overhead
holy god this is going to change my life in a zillion different ways
i must be nuts
and we were quite a pair
her believing in me
me believing that i deserved it
we hear the sound of voices human voices howling like dogs
human voices howling like dogs
david is led down the hallway to his appointment past many doors with thick windows and howling prisoners
aaron pulls him along
they arrive at the psychiatric unit
mccabe is visible standing deep in thought through the door
mccabe holds his drawings standing
david is seated
i see you havent been wasting your time
do you ever draw anything else
all the drawings are of sofia drawn in a similar fashion
david is a little jumpy a little amped
he moves to the window
the yard is filled with prisoners
did you sleep last night
i did not sleep
ive got to leave early today so youll have to be brief
what can you tell me about the name ellie
is that a girl you knew
a girl you were in love with
ive only been in love once
apparently you kept repeating it last night
you did sleep david and your advisor said you cried out you had a nightmare
everything is a nightmare you cried out for ellie david
do you remember what happened
dig deep david
you cried out for ellie
what do you remember about ellie
show me your face david
open the door
david rises and goes to the prison window
angle on mccabe in powerful framing lower shot capturing him powerfully
digging deeper aching to help its true you had an accident
its true you were disfigured but not anymore
do you remember
with certainty they did fix your face
take off that mask david
youll see your face is perfect under there
i never trusted the doctors
what happened next was surreal
that same arrogant bastard dr
pomeranz called me and suddenly he was my new best friend
friendly with outstretched hand standing in front of x rays warmly david
hey my brother
really bad about our last conversation
hed discovered a new form of reconstructive surgery with the help of a doctor from berlin
who bows to camera
the next thing i knew they shot me full of drugs id never heard of and away we went
surgical theatre a day david is wheeled down the hallway on a stretcher
he is high on tranquilizers singing one of us
the doctors are all smiles
what if gawd was one of ussssss
the odds they said were one in three that the headaches could be reduced by and facial tissue could be regenerated
david is strapped onto a plank headed for a metallic capsule
we hear odd noises and see high tech details of the operation
laser beams criss cross his face
shot moves to the video playback of the operation with this legend beneath capture
an assistant doctor captures polaroid frames
i couldnt tell you what they did
it seemed like science fiction to me
hes going to be one good looking guy when im done
a polaroid still of david in mid operation rolls out of the print machine
obviously i was suspicious
wouldnt you be
david and mccabe both sit against the wall
mccabe listens intently
suspicious of whom
once youve been driven off a bridge at miles an hour somehow you dont invite happiness in without a full body search
well at the risk of boring you i can present the alternate argument
i once knew a guy who was a real loner
and one day he woke up at with two daughters who lit his life up with purpose
suddenly he goes to endless school plays he gets home at for the evening discussion and he has the time of his life
his favorite beatle was once john and now its paul
i always liked
it all depends on the individual doesnt it
whats happiness for you
whats happiness to you david
how about another question well you wont show me your face
so back to the time line
lets move through this
there is tension in the air
davids face is covered in high tech facial plates
he sits at a table near the window
youve got to take the plates off david
i dont want to know whats under here
its going to be fine youll see
i already called pomeranz and switched it to wednesday
i hope that shrew at the front desk gave you shit about it
ill go in the morning
the carll be fixed
she advances takes his face in her hands
she tugs at the corner of one of the plates
good because i know that the problem wouldnt be you delaying something you were dreading
couldnt be that
nooooo it couldnt be that
she pulls off one of the plates
i mean i agree its very important to have
she pulls off another one of the plates
she grows a bit emotional
the right car
she pulls off another one of the plates
to take you where you want to go
hours a day
quadrant by quadrant his face is restored to a pale skinned and tender
how bad is it
well your ears are in the right place
and the rest of it is
not too bad at all
tenderly she kisses and hugs him
sofia and david make love looking into each others eyes
do you love me
i mean really love me
because if you dont ill just
have to kill you
in my next life i want to come back as this mole points out mole between her breasts seriously this mole
i mean youll have to wear bikini tops to work or loose fitting shirts so i can breathe but i love you
i love you
i love you
i could live right there
is this a dream
she grabs his face kisses him
a powerful moment like few others in this life
portrait of the couple together moving down the middle of the street on fresh snow
we talked about the big things the little things and the big things
but in truth with sofia it was the in between times
a perfect laugh
david admires her sits next to her holding her hand
theirs is the unmistakable closeness of a couple in the first real throes of a sexual relationship
they share a giddy open secret
across the table we reveal brian
hes got a tiny high tech camera
sofia speaks sweetly and passionately to david in spanish
david replies knowingly si every few words
its a deep communication
what did she say
in love i have no idea
brian shakes his head
hows things brian
davids face is huge in the brians viewfinder
hows things brian
dont flatter yourself
besides sofia is great but by no means one of a kind
she was a proximity infatuation
brian naturally suspicious and somewhat jealous spots a writer at a nearby table making notes
to writer and dont use that its mine
the writer looks busted
whered you get the camera
im into things
you have no idea
well as long as youre okay
and anyway were friends arent we
david offers his hand
davids gaze moves to a year old man staring at him with a bemused smile
a plate of food sits in front of him
his eyes suggest a piercing intellect he looks at david with deep familiarity
david cant quite place the face
hey whats up with your face
fuck theres a seam opening or something
mounting horror what what are you talking about
the spell is broken
david sleeps next to sofia
he sits up takes a glass of water from the night stand admires his girlfriend and moves to the bathroom
he turns on the light fills the glass with water
looks up into the restored mirror
his face is disfigured
he recoils in terror knocking against a towel rack sinking to the floor and grabbing a look at a shiny surface on the lower cabinet
sofia bolts upright
she sees him on the floor across the room sees his face and backs up in the bed leaning on her arm screaming
he awakens suddenly
sofia is next to him smiling
was i snoring
still breathing heavily no i think it was me
thirsty thats all
she kisses his hand reassuringly
im dreaming about you
he gets up and goes to the bathroom
tentatively he flips the light on
a very relieved david regards his restored face
he shuts off the light quickly and fills the glass of water
splashes some water on his face
david climbs back into bed
small laugh i could listen to you say mmmmm for the rest of my life
the kiss expands as he moves to the back of her neck
he caresses her body
she kisses his fingertips
her back to him
tangled in sheets they ease into lovemaking with the perfect fit of two bodies meant for each other
he gently grabs a handful of her hair
his hand stops
its not sofias hair
he slowly turns her face to his and we glimpse david over the shoulder of the woman who is not sofia
he leaps out of bed falling to the floor the sheet tangled around him
he turns on the light
julie gianni hides her face from the light like a night animal caught in the intrusive glare of day
when she speaks it is with sofias cadence and accent
scared uncomprehending baby whats wrong
he gasps for breath backing away
in a low voice where
his instinct is to protect his lifeline sofia and he pounces on her with a manic will to survive
julie gianni looks a little loopy almost stoned
taunting sweet im sofia
david dismantles the phone takes the cord
he ties her willing hands to the posts of the bed
she protests oddly like an actress playing a part
now im going to make sure that i tie this four times
do you know why julie
because four times really means something
david pulls his pants on frantically opens the wardrobe closet
goes to the kitchen
julie sobs quietly sweetly tied to the bed
she behaves and acts like sofia
david dont hurt me
david returns and sits across from her on the bed terrified and barely hanging on
okay im freaked out
so just tell me right now where is sofia
i am sofia
in one minute im going to call the police heart breaking dont do it honey
i knew youd survived the accident
she looks at him with tearful eyes
whose body was it
whos the one who hired you
the seven dwarves
i havent had any accident
no of course not
it wasnt an accident at all
it was attempted murder
he picks up the phone
ive captured an intruder whos entered my home
he turns to her
her eyes are yearning
the flash of mug shots
we see david sitting sweating agitated waiting in a police station holding room
suddenly the door opens and thomas tipp enters flanked by other detectives
guys can you give us a minute here
the room empties and tipp approaches david
they think that i had something to so with this
im going to handle this exactly the way your father would have handled this
ive got it solved
youve got it solved
where is she
shes going to be fine
david hugs tipp
thank god youre here man
i love her
now i want you to look at these photos and then im going to destroy them
sofias testimony is also in here
it wont exist
shes not going to press charges
press charges against
david wake up
as your friend i think you should see what you did to sofia
the press wont get hold of this if you get
david leans back in his seat
its all of them everybody against him
tipp opens a file thick with paperwork two computer discs and photos
he displays a photo to david moving it into the light so he sees it clearly
julie gianni battered
this is julie gianni
thats not sofia
this is julie gianni
i didnt do that do that to her
beginning to shut down tommy someones setting me up
david the board and i have taken care of everything
theyve been really great actually
all of this is going to disappear
were all behind you
even the board
david looks at tipp
its very clear now
hes one of them
david attempts calm
quiet helpful get out of here
a migraine is thundering in davids head
his world is spinning backwards
police station a night david strides down the hallway
a man in a crystal blue sport coat stands waiting
as david passes the man confides a single line as if smuggling out a valuable secret
voices from other rooms including a small child saying mommy mommy
this is a revolution of the mind
exiting david is intercepted by a furious brian
youre in fucking sad shape man
dont fucking ever hit a girl man
hit me but dont fucking ever hit a girl
david looks up sees a small security camera trained on them pulls brian out of the station
it wasnt sofia
it was julie
it was julie gianni
so sofia was abducted by julie and now julie is posing as sofia
youre in o
julie gianni is fucking dead
i dont know what the cops have told you but let me assure you julie gianni is alive alive alive
i didnt talk to the cops
i talked to sofia
where is she
i just dropped sofia off
and i saw everything you did to her
let me tell you something i did not do that to her
look me in the eye and tell me that it was the same girl you brought to the party
tell me it was your dream girl your proximity infatuation
raw finally yes
and you stole her from me
david backs away as brian responds bitterly from his heart
the one girl i really wanted and you took her from me
youre losing it man
david nods powerfully
he now understands
brian is one of them too
you have revealed yourself
oh yeah im with them
whered you get the coat brian
whered you get the camera
how much did they pay you
listen to me cause its the last time were ever gonna speak
i was your only friend
you have revealed yourself to me
david nurses a drink still breathing heavily
hes been crying
his head aches with this thought maybe i am insane
a man in a classy suit walks towards him inviting himself to sit at the table
his bedside manner is impeccable
his smile offers infinite compassion
he was the man staring at
him in this same restaurant
he is problems
takes a sip im in no mood to be fucked with
so do yourself a favor and le theres an explanation for all this david
who the fuck are you
you and i know each other
you found me on the internet
david stares at the man
what do you want
why are you following me
im here to help you
and first of all its very important that you calm down
you must overcome your fears and regain control
take hold of your life again
its as easy as holding that glass
what if i told you that you can take control of all of this
david turns to him
im straight okay
david look at these people
it seems as though theyre chatting away doesnt it
nothing to do with you david listens as he looks at the spirited saturday night crowd lost in their revelry
and yet they might only be here because you wanted them to be
you are their god
and not only that you could make them obey you
or even destroy you
david shakes his head exhausted and in no mood
he shuts his eyes fights off a headache
cutting him off what id like them to do is shut up
david opens his eyes
theyre all staring at him
casually waiting for orders
david looks at him with horror backing away
receding in his vision you and i signed a contract david
mccabe is taut following the thread
his voice calming
who is the man in the restaurant
who is it
i can t
can you tell the difference between dreams and reality
think about it
think with your head
you signed a contract did you not
a woman walks down the hallway looking back
flash of papers signed
i signed something
was the man at the restaurant there
mccabes voice becomes infinitely calm and helpful
accept your bodys resistance
let your head answer
who is ellie
i dont know whats real
what happened that night david
i dont want to remember
do you understand that you hold the keys to this prison
it wasnt sofia
who was it
who was it
you want to let it out dont you david
youre about to tell me
tell me what your heart and soul will not allow you to forget
did you kill sofia
mccabe stands tall stunned and curious still pressing to pull the nightmare out of him
the clown figurine on her stove top falls over as we hear the front door kicked in
david enters slamming the door behind him
he looks around what was once the site of such happiness
the same details hed glimpsed long ago are now horrifying to him
he looks at a photo on the refrigerator
the same note call dad
the exact expression exact photograph hed seen on his earlier visit
now it is julie who is in her place
he opens her drawer
just some papers
the drawing hed once done of her
now featuring julie
he rips up the drawing and proceeds to destroy the apartment until he stops collecting himself
takes a breath and
a lamp is broken over his head
julie gianni bends down to help him
a shard of the lamp base is still in her hand
julies whole demeanor is that of a different girl
even her voice is softer almost exactly the knock around sweetness of sofia
i thought you were a vandal
with difficulty who
you are not sofia
youre not sofia
julie starts to cry
battling tears she offers her heart and soul
this will all be over soon
well be together again
youll forget julianna and i wont be afraid of you
let me get you a cold towel
he struggles to rise
his head is a swirling mess
and then sofia slowly returns with towel
her image still blurry
david advances and faints into her arms
whispers yes david im sofia
he accepts it all of it whatever it is just to hold her
they kiss gently then more powerfully
they make love emotionally and deeply
two bodies yearning to possess the other
camera moves across their bodies as david wipes frame to black as the move continues onto her back
where were you
sofia doesnt answer doesnt want to lose the moment
i dont want to know
thrusting just tell me you love me
david keeps his face buried in her shoulder
he doesnt want to look
the passion gives way to a mounting dread as he hears a voice almost like sofias
i love you
im afraid of how powerful this is
he continues moving passionately harder now
julie responds to the overwhelming surge within david
she gives over to the waves of dark pleasure riding him like a rocket
grabbing her hands and pulling them high above her head clamping down with his own
julie gianni cries a deep guttural sound of passion
this is what someone sounds like when theyre not faking it
a pillow comes down over her face
what the fuck is happening
julie begins to react to what is clearly no longer an advanced lovemaking session
i want to see your face
she grabs at the pillow
i want to see your face
david reaches orgasm sobbing recklessly out of control
julies body stops kicking and settles into silence
he loosens the pillow and is rewarded with one last violent attempt at life
her hand smacks his neck
hes so taut it bounces off
she grabs at his face one last time her hand is left with enough power only to caress his face
she goes limp
davids crying turns to a whimper
he looks at the pillow over julies head
hes confused a puddle of jagged adrenaline
he doesnt want to remove the pillow for fear of who could be underneath
he rises up his elbow across her lifeless chest
with true horror he knows he has to move his hand but his hand will reveal who hes just killed
as his arm moves inexorably away from her chest
quarter inch by quarter inch he inches it downward across the top of her breasts
dreading the inevitable not seeing it and then
there it is
the mole between her breasts
david exits hurriedly past some tenants down the stairs
he looks up at his own reflection in the hallway mirror
he looks horribly disfigured
we hear the sound of breathing encased in a mask
mccabe sits across from david
mccabe looks away haunted by the admission of guilt
i did it didnt i
like i killed someone
i feel like
im in a dream
was the man at the restaurant
david shakes his head
pained sometimes the mind behaves as if it were in a dream
faces change people become other people
the subconscious is a powerful thing
you treated julie carelessly didnt you david
your feeling of responsibility or guilt over julie might have easily turned sofia into julie
pause do you know what derangement is
i need your help
all i know is you killed your girlfriend and i dont know whats in your mind
i need your help
id work on this case forever if i could but weve run out of time
what will you plead
its your best chance
they wont believe me
what do you believe
believe it or not i care about you
youve become like family to me
i dont want to give up on you
david looks at him oddly
suddenly the archetype seems very familiar
mccabe continues with the noble concern of a towering father figure
continued but i needed more
i needed an answer
i even thought there was more than a good chance someone was playing tricks on you
maybe it was the board
but i cant exceed my duties here
im just a psychologist and i have to leave you
will i see you at the trial
im just the opening act
david sits at
the table as mccabe and aaron exit
he hears aarons television its the life extension infomercial
through the glass of the psychiatric unit we see mccabe and aaron exit
only aarons television sitting on a stool remains
push in on the television which is playing the l
push in on the reverse
its david at the window as he realizes the true meaning of ellie l
he bangs on the glass at first slow then faster yelling for mccabe
infomercial and benny the dog are reflected on the window
mccabe hustles down the hallway with david
mccabe stands tall moving forward like atticus finch with tom robinson
mccabe watches david closely
aaron the guard turns to look at david behind the glass partition that separates them
david looks out the window at the world hes missed
the police vehicle pulls up in front of a crowded business plaza
mccabe exits with david
always watching his every move his every revelation
david looks upward at the towering skyscraper in the center of the plaza rising high into the sky
a building guard guides them through the lobby
mccabe trained on david
a look between the two
a building guard intercepts them
to building guard life extension corporation please
what a look to david l
we hold a court order
i think ive been here before mccabe strides purposefully past the building guard
aaron shows the pass and hustles to keep up
the elevator door opens to reveal a very pleasant and peaceful environment
comfortable lounging chairs
on the reception station is written l
and underneath it the words life extension corporation
two more guards meet them
mccabe watches david as aaron releases him from the handcuffs
the group moves together
senses are overwhelming david as they approach the reception station
her name is libby
a stunning young woman rises and moves to greet them
im here to assist you
libby stares at davids masked face
its slightly unsettling to her
hes my son
hes very shy
smiling professionally youre not
with the media or part
of any legal consortium correct
welcome to life extension
have a look at our proposal
please follow me
she offers them two bound folders featuring the logo l
and guides them down the hallway looking back with great style beckoning just as in davids dream recollections
to aaron you can wait out here
youll be meeting rebecca dearborn
aside my personal role model
containing monitors with video taped tour guides
talking heads expressing the convictions of life extension
compassionate expressive people
the bits of their testimonials echo phrases from davids own life
and im not a true believer by nature
but the older you get the more you see the flow of the future and i made a choice
why not embrace the future
i believe the research the future is in the union of the spiritual
and the scientific
annoyed at everything around him mccabe pulls david onward
aames and mccabe sit and wait in a warm wood paneled office proposals in hand
a glimpse shows words like re evolve and re experience peppered with colorful photos of simple life affirming portraits of everyday life
its well appointed and well marketed organization
mccabe regards david as the victim of a lunatics scam
injustice fuels mccabe
continuing scoffing cryonization a journey of re awakening after the preservation of the human body at extremely low temperatures
they laughed at jules verne too
a little sadly david youre not account liaison rebecca dearborn enters with paperwork
she is an electric presence
efficient caring and oddly compassionate
mccabe how are you
im rebecca dearborn
quick notice of mask life extension or l
as we like to refer to it is a glimpse of the future
not in the juvenile sense but in the deeply meaningful sense that can only be borne in the human heart
the dna codes of the human body have been broken
soon heart ailments cancer and so much more will be a thing of the past
very simply your anguish
even your death is no longer necessary in a traditional sense
whatever malady that hides behind that mask
she looks directly at david and it stirs him
mccabe studies her and the operation
he thirsts for clues
david flips through the folder toward the back a panel of photos of storage tanks
lavishly and warmly photographed just like next years cars in a magazine
within an hour of your passing l
will transfer your body to a vessel where you will be sealed and frozen at degrees below zero
power outages earthquakes nothing will effect your suspension hibernation
did you sign this contract david
david looks down at pamphlet looks up
whats the lucid dream option
the lucid dream is life extensions newest option
for a little extra we offer the cryonic union of science and entertainment
rueful skeptical cryo tainment
dearborn spreads apart the paperwork on her desk to reveal a thin video monitor built into the glass table top
aames and mccabe peer into the table top as dearborn presses play
some find this presentation helpful
an appealing presentation begins mans life
a generic happy looking man with graphics floating out of his mouth re emerge
a voice takes over for dearborn
a wonderfully comforting tone is present in the narration
like that of a parent
portrait of a modern human life
highlighting stage birth
highlighting another stage and death
imagine that you are suffering from a terminal illness
youd like to be cryonized but youd rather be resurrected to continue your own life as you know it now
offers you the answer
upon resurrection you will continue in an ageless state preserved but living in the present with a future of your choosing
push in on a door that opens to a panel of steel compartments
music and atmosphere are seductive and compelling
your death will be wiped from your memory
your life will continue as a realistic work of art painted by you minute to minute
and youll live it with the romantic abandon of a summer day
with the feeling of a great movie or a pop song you always loved
with no memory of how it all occurred save for the knowledge that everything simply
and in any instance of discontent youll be visited by technical support
shot of edmund ventura holding a life extension folder in his arms
graphic reads tech support
it is all just around the corner the day after tomorrow
the words life part two drift onto the screen obscuring the phase marked death
another chapter begins seamlessly a living dream
life extensions promise to you
life part two
a living dream
your death will be wiped from your memory
i guess i missed that one in usa today
david sits reeling from the revelation he may be living a lucid dream
what if there was a mistake
what if the dream became a nightmare
of course your subconscious can always play tricks on you
the subconscious is a very powerful thing sits forward
he turns to david with great strength worried for him
did you sign a contract with these people david
continuing but this is a serious business
the lucid dream is worth the risk
and what is any life if not the pursuit of a dream
the dream of peace
the dream of achievement
the dream of hearing someone saying these words when they truly mean them
david is deeply moved as he listens
somewhere music begins to play
it is the beach boys good vibrations
i love you david
roam free david
most of us live our whole lives with no real adventure to call our own
its hard to comprehend but they laughed at jules verne too
this is a revolution of the this is a revolution of the mind
david pulls off his mask
he runs out
david storms around the corner from dearborns office yelling raving
i want to wake up
i want to wake up
aaron grabs for him
david wrenches free
david runs down the corridor and into the elevator aaron chasing after him
its a nightmare
the doors shut
david runs out of the elevator into the empty lobby
shot cranes up to reveal he is utterly alone reminiscent of the much earlier times square shot
we hear the ding of the elevator
who turns and approaches the elevator exiting frame
david enters the elevator to see edmund ventura calmly waiting
i think its time we had a proper re introduction
im edmund ventura from the oasis project formerly life extension a tech support
yes im your tech support
we first met years ago
you sold me the lucid dream
well what the hell happened
i tried to warn you in the bar
i told you to exercise control that it all depended on your mind
all of this everything is your creation
and were now heading toward your true moment of choice
true moment of choice
when did the lucid dream begin
remember the day of the nightclub
trying to remember yes
david is collapsed on the ground
his mask clutched in his hand passed out
with importance that night when sofia left you and you fell asleep on the pavement that was the moment you chose for the splice
remembers the word the splice
the mask has tumbled out of his hand
the end of your real life and the beginning of l
s lucid dream
a splice of many years which passed while you were frozen and dreaming
a moody day dawns
davids mask is just outside the reach of his outstretched hand
sofias hand reaches in and awakens him
everything is suddenly a little more vivid a little more super real
open your eyes
they walk away down the street into a beautiful vanilla sky
sofia slips her arm around his shoulder as weve seen earlier
from the moment you woke up on that street nothing was real in a traditional sense
your lucid dream is monitored by life extension and a panel of experts who follow your every thought
even at this moment
the scene continues as david aames rides the elevator
the compartment now rises above the first seven floors to reveal they are traveling upwards in an exterior elevator
other skyscrapers pass by outside the window
im blowing your mind
david looks down with dread
im not a big fan of heights
continuing we erased what really happened from your memory
reaching to understand erased
replaced by a better life under these beautiful monet like skies
recognizing pieces my mothers favorite
a better life because you had sofia
walking down the center of the village street
and you sculpted your lucid dream out of the iconography of your youth
from the life and psyche of his youth
mirrored in davids life in moments weve already seen
an album cover that once moved you
an album cover
the cover of freewheelin bob dylan
a movie you once saw late at night that showed you what a father could be like
atticus finch sits at the breakfast table with his kids
the exact pose as mccabe and david talk in one of their prison conversations
or what love could be like
her head held high laughing
laughing in the same way a moment from jules et jim
the compartment hurtles upwards rising higher than the surrounding buildings
this was a kind woman an individual more than your equal
ventura nods wistfully
he fell in love with her a little too
you barely knew her in real life but
in your lucid dream she was your savior
trying to remember feeling the flashes of truth in brief moments
and then a bracing challenging realization that something went wrong
what happened in my real life
what did you erase
do you really want to know
almost nauseous tell me everything
match push in on david rising to his feet
his disfigured face thunders with a massive migraine
shot we once saw as david and sofia walked away together
this time david is alone
the morning after the nightclub you woke up on that street hung over and along
you got up and walked away
you never saw sofia again
i didnt kill sofia
he cant remember any of this
you battled your board the seven dwarves for control
in the end it was thomas tipp your fathers friend the one whose job you saved who wrenched the company back in your control
david exits the company elevator and returns to aames publications
tipp is out in front of the employees and staffers who welcome him back
vague memories but then
david sits in front of the computer in bad physical shape
you longed for sofia
you shut yourself away for months
you were alone
you couldnt take the pain anymore
you could barely function
i found you on the internet
i signed the contract with you
aames takes pills collapses
it comes back to him powerfully
it was me
its zipped up
the plastic wrapped body of david aames is slipped into a tube which is clamped shut
a christmas tree in the background as music continues
and on a day in late december you gave yourself to us
youre now in a suspended state
davids apartment a memorial day friends and family clog the old apartment
shelby looks out into the hallway and sees an old acquaintance
your friend brian shelby threw a three day memorial in your old home
he was a true friend
sofia ventures into davids apartment alone taking in the environment and remembering the best moments of her brief encounter with david
you were missed david
she moves into close up and we see the wonder and the joy of a perfect love nearly attained
she soaks in the beautiful painful mystery of life
it was sofia who never fully recovered
it was she who somehow knew you best
and like you she never forgot that one night where real true love seemed possible
david contemplates getting into the car with julianna
he makes the choice that
will change this and his next life
its the little things
sofia exits the shot and were left with an empty frame
david turns from looking out the window of the elevator
tears in eyes the little things
theres nothing bigger is there
david and ventura exit the elevator onto the rooftop
your subconscious did create problems
your dream turned into a nightmare
the glitch has been corrected
so all i have to do is imagine something
if i wanted mccabe to come back right now mccabe comes flying out of the door
listen to me
these people are dangerous
were in trouble
we need to get off this roof now
who turns from mccabe to ventura
ventura leads david away
were now on pause
and youre about to return to your lucid dream
continuing with all of the upgrades
you wont remember any of this nor be charged for the technical support
it is now your moment of choice
you can return to your lucid dream and live a beautiful life with sofia or whomever you wish
or you can choose the world out there
ventura gestures to the city beyond as they come to a halt
the world out
and you can bring me back just
like benny the dog
the client is starting to understand
just like benny the dog
your face and body can now be fixed of course
but its very different out there now
your finances wont last long
your panel of observers are waiting for you to choose
ventura gestures into the camera
he begins walking backwards to the roofs ledge
there are no guarantees
but remember even in the future the sweet is never as sweet without the sour
david sees that brian shelby has now joined mccabe on the roof
he nods to brian who nods back
how do i wake up
the decision is yours
ventura glances over the edge
and i chose this scenario didnt enjoying that he understands yes to face your last remaining fear of heights
david dont listen to him
you were right
this is the seven dwarves
its a set up
you cant trust him
david looks at mccabe with compassion
dont feel bad david
this winning man is your creation
its in his nature to fight for his existence
but hes not real
who looks on with compassion
mccabe fights for himself
i have two daughters
you know that
what are their names
who feels for mccabe as the apparition crumbles
mortality as home entertainment
this cannot be the future
david regards mccabe
once dynamic mccabe now seems unsure of his own existence
slowly always looking at david he settles into the truth of his very being
with great nobility mccabe shoves his hands into his pockets and faces his own destiny
or lack thereof
its been a brilliant journey of self awakening and youve simply got to ask yourself what is happiness to you
his moment of realization
i want to live a real life
i dont want to dream any longer
any last wishes
let them out there read my mind
i wish you well david
music rises as he turns to see sofia
he moves to her
she touches his cheek
his face is restored
look at us
im frozen and youre dead
and i love you
its a problem
i lost you when i got in that car
she looks at him beguiling and understanding
but remember what you told me once
every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around
she kisses him
ill find you again
she regards her lost love taking him in
david treasures his last moments with her
david takes a breath and begins backing to the ledge
ill see you in another life when we are both cats
david backs up and begins to run
he arrives at the edge looking down at the distance to the ground stopping himself at the precipice
he looks back to sofia one last time and then leaps out into the celestial future
for a fraction of a moment he is suspended in mid air
and he hurtles to the ground
and the ground hurtles to meet him
it is the little things the random poetic instances of david aames life that come back to him
music rises as he realizes finally his own true poetry and humanity
the images topple onto each other with the rhythm of his heartbeat
a casual glance of a stranger
all combine to give his life meaning
and then finally we see the face of the one person who gave him purpose in this life
and the next
the sound of a breath
a gulp of life
someones heart is beating
open your eyes
an eye opens and the pupil darts to the right and left
open your eyes
