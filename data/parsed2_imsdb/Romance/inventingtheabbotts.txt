screenplay by ken hixon from the short story by sue miller march draft opening credits roll over a tent montage assorted angles of a group of men hard at work
erecting a large striped big top style canvas tent including the long steel stakes being sledge hammered into the lawn practiced hands rapidly rigging the lines the tall center poles being leveraged upright the heavy rolled up sections of canvas being maneuvered into position and ending with the canvas being hoisted up the poles as the tent assumes its full and finished form
on the front yard of the abbott mansion
the residence is on main street four blocks from where the commercial district begins
the mature over arching trees makes this street of prosperous houses a grand promenade
jacey holt and doug holt walk along the sidewalk on their way to school
jacey is seventeen hes as handsome and seemingly self confident as his younger brother is rumpled and impulsive
doug is fifteen a popular culture chameleon who takes on the colors and affectations of whomever his hero is at the moment which presently happens to be elvis presley
jacey stops and stares with open faced misery at the tent on the abbotts front yard the installation of the tent indicates that the abbotts are having yet another of
the many parties they throw every year
didnt get invited huh
go to hell
im not going and i got invited

inventing the abbotts rev
pam i guess

jacey swats dougs school books out from under his arm doug charges his brother to retaliate but they are rudely interrupted by a car horn
they scurry out of the way as lloyd abbott pulls his cadillac out of the driveway and cruises down the street
lloyd is a well dressed and fed man in his mid forties
a midwestern burgher he exudes the status he enjoys as one of the preeminent pillars of this community
doug is embarrassed by lloyds passing but jacey evidently experiences a deeper humiliation he gives doug a glance of betrayal turns and walks down the block
eleanor abbott gathers some books from her locker
eleanor is sixteen outgoing sarcastic and very popular
she is the middle of the three abbott daughters
eleanor closes her locker turns and discovers jacey standing behind her
he follows her down the busy hall
i tried to call you last night but the line was busy
no it wasnt
inventing the abbotts rev
it was busy all night
maybe you had the wrong number
are you mad at me
are you mad at me
who said i was
i just wanted to talk to you last night
we can talk tonight at the party
i wasnt invited
yes you were
no i wasnt
well now you are
but if youre mad at me you dont have to come
she gives him a sultry smile turns and glides into a classroom as the bell rings
the corridor is quickly vacated by all but jacey he savors the aftertaste of eleanors smile
establishing angle of the modest two story clapboard house in a working class neighborhood
a home made ping pong table takes up so much room in the detached garage that it forced the eviction of the family car a plymouth coupe which is parked
nearby on the driveway
the garage doors are open and the garage light is on
we hear v
doug singing bits and pieces of heartbreak hotel in his best elvis fashion
inventing the abbotts rev
doug stands in front of the bathroom mirror wearing a coat and tie still singing heartbreak hotel while he carefully draws sideburns on his face with a wide nib pen
and a bottle of india ink
jaceys reflection appears in the mirror behind doug hes wearing a coat and tie too
jacey does a pained take on dougs handiwork oh christ
helen holt is seated at the dining table
she was grading a stack of spelling tests with a red pencil when jacey and doug came in to ask her to adjudicate the matter at hand
she is an attractive but unostentatious woman without interest in appearing to be anything other than what she is a forty one year old widow raising two teenage sons on
a school teachers salary
she teaches second grade at haley elementary school
he has to wash it off mother
you cannot let him go to the party unless he washes it off
itll look worse if i wash it
its india ink itll turn gray itll look like dirt
he looks like such a clown and he doesnt even know it
he doesnt get how things work in this town
i thought you werent even going to the party
changed my mind
doug you do understand that you may be the only person at this party with artificial sideburns
you do understand that your sideburns dont look real
doug was hoping they didnt look that phony but he conceals his disappointment and nods inventing the abbotts rev
that they look really as though youd drawn them on
swallows then shrugs yeah
she looks hard at doug for a beat then turns to jacey
well darling it seems he does understand
why dont you just go on to the party and ignore doug
just have a good time and pretend you dont even
jacey curses under his breath and storms out the front door before his mother can finish her sermon
the curb is lined with parked cars
we hear a dance band playing que sera and the sounds of the party as doug lopes up the sidewalk sporting his india ink sideburns and smoking a cigarette
he flicks the cigarette into the street with well rehearsed ease as he turns and walks up the long driveway towards the glowing big top tent
doug trails his hand over lloyd abbotts cadillac caressing it from hood to trunk as he ambles by
doug enters the tent and surveys the gathering a tuxedoed ten piece band plays on the bandstand
despite his mothers advice a nauseated grimace falls over jaceys face when he sees that his younger brother has arrived
he is dancing with eleanor
they dance past a group of young men on the sidelines jaceys senior classmates they are all edgy with envy waiting like predators for their chance to dance with eleanor
im going out to the lake tomorrow
sandy wants to show off her dads new boat
why dont you come
i have to work
well i guess youll just have to write me a letter
what do you mean
you said you wanted to talk to me in private
we never get a chance to be together alone you know
steve one of the envious classmates makes his move and cuts in on jacey and dances away with eleanor
jacey handles it with aplomb but his true irritation at being separated from the object of his desire reveals itself as he observes eleanor flirting with her new dance partner
sampling the hors doeuvres
he places the ones he doesnt like back onto the platter
pamela abbott steps over to doug
she is his age fifteen the youngest of the abbott girls and the least stuck up
u doug hi
she points at dougs chest
like your tie
inventing the abbotts rev
doug glances down at his tie and pam flips her index finger up across the tip of his nose
doug scowls and points at her bust
can i borrow a kleenex
mouth full of food got any smokes around here
doug and pam smoke their cigarettes in the back yard
the tent can be seen in the b
the band is playing so is this peter guy alice is gonna marry rich
hes one of the atlas steel vanlaninghams
hes a bully
so how come alices marrying him
because my parents want her to and alice is afraid of my parents
its practically an arranged marriage
they think alice has peanut shells for brains or something so they sort of suggested that maybe it was time to tie the old knot and they sort of suggested
that peter was the one to do it with
jeez no one can be that much of a pushover
inventing the abbotts rev
look alice is the good daughter eleanor is the bad one and im the one who sort of gets off the hook
thats just the way it works
which one are you
you mean which kind of brother am i
you got me
the little brother i guess
the band improvises a fanfare as lloyd abbott and his wife joan abbott step up onto the bandstand
joan has the practiced poise of a former beauty queen as if her smile had been surgically sewn onto her face
she has a tendency to smoke and drink a bit too much and eat and sleep a bit too little
ladies and gentlemen id like to propose a toast in honor of our cause for celebration tonight the engagement of our daughter alice to mister peter vanlaningham
he gestures to alice abbott and her fiance peter vanlaningham
alice is nineteen the eldest and the prettiest and seemingly most conventional of the three sisters
peter is the scion of a wealthy pittsburgh family
he and his bride to be smile and acknowledge the applause and ad libbed toasts
the band strikes up i got the world on a string and joan whispers something to alice alice goes over to lloyd and despite his mock protest pulls him out
onto the dance floor
the guests applaud their uninspired box step neither father nor daughter appear comfortable at such close quarters
the party is going full swing as doug wanders out of the tent and walks down the driveway
hes had enough of high society for tonight
doug strolls along the sidewalk in a residential neighborhood softly singing you aint nothin but a hound dog
he pauses beside a rubbish can on the curb strikes a wooden match and sets the trash on fire
as he nonchalantly continues down the sidewalk we see several trash cans on fire in the near distance
eleanor necks with steve jaceys rival on the glider in the gazebo in the distant corner of the yard
the sounds of the party can be heard in the b
the band is playing in old monterey
jacey stands in the shadows of the shrubbery spying on them with pure heartache
jacey walks home with his eyes brimming with bitter tears past the smoldering rubbish cans along the curb
as jacey turns up the driveway a light snaps on in the garage
the garage doors are open doug sits on the edge of the ping pong table smoking a cigarette with his hand still on the light fixture pull chain
three out of five
two out of three
jacey and doug pick up their paddles and begin a game of ping pong
they are expert players and fierce competitors
inventing the abbotts rev
lloyd abbott pulls his cadillac up to the pumps
the ding ding of the bell hose summons jacey
he wears a texaco uniform complete with bow tie and cap
fill er up
jacey sets the pump nozzle on automatic and cleans the windshield
lloyd slips the ashtray out of the dash climbs out of the car and empties the ashtray in the trash can
that was a nice party last night
you were there
eleanor invited me
didnt see you
slight beat you going to be an engineer like your dad was
i want to be an architect
i guess some people care more about having ideas that they do about making money
i care about making money
lloyd idly examines the mechanism on the ashtray that enables it to slide in and out of the dash
that full suspension file drawer your dad invented is still in production did you know that
well ship thirty maybe forty thousand of those file cabinets this year
hell that drawer put midwest steel desk on the map
an architect huh
the gas nozzle clicks off jacey hangs up the nozzle and replaces the gas cap
lloyd pulls out his wallet
you want some free advice
dont waste your life making other people rich
keep the change
he hands jacey a five spot and gets into his car
lloyd drives away in his cadillac
jacey crumbles the five dollar bill into a ball
as he returns to the office he catches his reflection in the mirror of the cigarette machine
he frowns and pulls off his cap and bow tie
the abandoned boathouse is a dilapidated structure situated on an isolated shore of the large lake
doug strikes a wooden match shepherds the flame leans over holds the match to his ass and lights a fart
the amorphous blue flame flares and almost instantly disappears as the gas is consumed
victor dougs partner in crime and best friend is impressed
victor is fifteen too
howd you do that
intestinal gas produced by bacterial metabolism of food residues in the colon
a mixture of oxygen hydrogen carbon dioxide and methane
thats the secret ingredient
whats so secret about it
not everyone can produce methane
its genetic that means its inherited
theres a lot of methane in my family
inventing the abbotts rev
youre full of shit
look it up its all in the encyclopedia
they dont got farts in the encyclopedia
hey they got vagina in the dictionary they got farts in the encyclopedia
the roar of a passing speedboat attracts dougs interest
incredulous vagina is in the dictionary
a canal leading from the uterus to the vulva
you sure read a lot man
slight beat a canal
doug steps out of the boathouse onto the sagging dock and sees a fast speedboat cutting across the lake towing a male water skier
another young man is driving the boat with two young women in bathing suits as passengers
victor comes out as the speedboats wake rocks the old dock
its jacey thats him skiing
he mustve skipped out on work
with jacey skiing behind it
steve is at the helm
eleanor and sandy lounge in their bathing suits
as they pass a ski ramp steve points to it
jacey gives him a thumbs up gesture and steve circles the boat around for the approach
hes never done the ramp
he wants to do it
steve lines up the approach and pushes the throttle open
jacey swings out on the end of the tow rope and pops over the wake
eleanor leans over to steve
you know youre going too fast
grins yeah i know
the boat zips by the ramp and jaceys skis contact the slippery surface and his skis go out from under him
he takes a hard bounce loses hold of the tow rope and goes tumbling over the apex of the ramp into the water
jacey is soaking in the bathtub
doug enters without knocking
time to eat
doug washes his hands
jacey climbs out of the tub and fetches a towel
and doug reacts to
jaceys back and buttocks are severely bruised
jacey wraps the towel around his waist and turns to his brother
dont tell mom
cutting him off just dont tell mom
yeah okay all right
jacey walks out of the bathroom
lloyd abbotts cadillac pulls up to the pumps
lloyd is behind the wheel joan sits next to him eleanor and pamela are in the back seat
the ding ding of the bell hose summons
sticks the mop hes been using into a pail and goes to answer the bell
he hesitates as he sees the abbotts and lets another attendant wait on them
he retreats into the garage and resumes mopping the floor
jacey finds eleanor standing in the garage doorway
i heard you got accepted to penn
howd you swing an ivy league school like that
my grandfather went there
i had the grades so
it stinks in here
i dropped something
i just thought you and steve
well thats what you thought
i think steve is
i dont even know what i think about steve i never think about him
i just do things
and let other people figure them out
thats what parents are for
theyre real good at doing all the thinking
why should i
slight beat alice is going to have a baby
she and kilroy didnt waste any time
hes already talking about having another and alice is up chucking every hour on the hour
shes got morning noon and night sickness
ive got the feeling shell be barefoot and puking for years to come
wallpaper patterns thats all she talks about
she and my mother spend hours looking at wallpaper pattern books
thats another thing i never think about
another beat well i think this is called the silent treatment
i get enough of that from my father i dont need it from you
good luck at penn
she starts to walk away but jacey pulls her back and kisses her fiercely eleanor responds with equal heat
they dont see pamela enter the garage
pam studies them for an imperturbable beat then come on eleanor dads waiting
the abbotts drive away
jacey stands in the garage in the b
he watches the cadillac disappear into traffic
inventing the abbotts rev
with lloyd behind the wheel joan in the front passenger seat and eleanor and pam in the back seat
lloyd says to eleanor stay away from him
because i said so
a family style restaurant in the center of town
its a sweltering hot july day
heat shimmers off the sidewalk
the decor is mock colonial
victor and doug in their bus boy uniforms are stocking a waitress station with silverware coffee cups and water glasses
we should have a party out at the boathouse man
thats what we should do
you know invite some girls
get some beer go swimming
look up a few words in the dictionary
inventing the abbotts rev
yeah like boring or eunuch
its latin for bus boy
webb crosby the proprietor of the restaurant steps over
business is a little light today too damn hot
which one of you knuckle heads wants to get off early
in unison me
takes out a coin call it in the air
doug bicycles away he won the coin toss
doug sails through the back door
he gets a bowl out of the cupboard and fetches the ice cream scoop from a drawer
doug enters with the bowl and ice cream scoop in hand
he lifts the lid of the freezer reaches for a carton of ice cream and something startles him
he cocks his head to listen and slowly lowers the freezer lid
he peers into the silvery dim light and sees jacey and eleanor naked on an old daybed near the coal bin in the back of the garage
she is on top of jacey riding him rhythmically
eleanor is facing doug
she reacts without alarm or shame when she notices doug staring at her
she coolly returns his stare
doug tries but hes unable to avert his eyes
inventing the abbotts rev
eleanor only shifts her gaze when distracted by her orgasm which triggers jaceys as she recovers her composure she says hi doug
jacey bolts upright throwing her off of him and shouts get out
doug drops the bowl and scoop and charges out of the garage
doug races away from the house on his bicycle pumping furiously and sweating profusely
doug dives into the lake in his underpants then surfaces
the water has cooled his body but not his mind
helen assists jacey as he packs his bags in preparation for his departure to college the next day
oh we forgot an umbrella
ill buy a new one in philadelphia
and dont forget your sport coat
yeah ill go pick it up
take doug with you
im just going to the cleaners
take him along for the ride
go have a root beer at the dognsuds
i gotta finish packing
ill finish up
dougs going to miss you
i think he will
oh dammit jacey please take your brother with you
jacey behind the wheel and doug drive into town in the plymouth coupe
after a long silence if mom starts having problems with the car stalling just change the fuel filter
it gets clogged up when she lets the gas tank get too low
and every once in a while take her to the movies so she doesnt just sit around the house all the time reading
she likes to read
she reads too much
inventing the abbotts rev
okay ill take her to the movies
slight beat you want to go have a beer
no a beer
a beer beer
where are we gonna get beer
the bait shop
if you go in alone and nobody else is in the store erniell sell you a couple of bottles
the plymouth is parked on a dirt lane separating two cornfields
jacey sits on the fender of the car nursing on a bottle of beer
doug urinates between two rows of corn
remember that time i got my dick caught in my zipper
jacey gives doug a quizzical look
you know when i was in first grade
in the boys room
remember i wouldnt let mrs
horton help me so she went and got mom out of her classroom but i wouldnt let mom help me either
i told her to go get you
yeah i remember
doug retrieves his beer from the roof of the car
a semi trailer drives past with midwest steel desk inc
haley illinois painted on its sides
we should own that company
what do you mean
midwest steel desk
dads file cabinet drawer
lloyd abbott screwed mom out of dads patent after he died
moms not stupid
i didnt say she was stupid
lloyds pretty smooth
thats why he owns the company
he owns the company cause he married the bosss daughter
he owns the company cause that patent saved the companys ass after the war when all the war contracts dried up
well maybe mom sold it cause we needed the money
we never had any money
money had nothing to do with it
then why did she sell the patent
she just did thats all that matters
and thats why were driving this car and not that one
jacey gestures to thunderbird convertible speeding past them
he finishes off his beer then i guess youll just have to be real careful zipping up your pants while im gone
helen stands on the curb waving good bye as the greyhound bus carrying jacey away to philadelphia departs
doug hangs back leaning against the plymouths fender
doug steals lustful looks at eleanor from behind his book
she is seated across the table from him
the library is filled with students poring over their assignments
eleanor is seemingly oblivious to dougs probing eyes
doug allows his pencil to roll off the edge of the table
he ducks under the table to retrieve his pencil and his ruse is revealed as he stares up eleanors skirt at the soft triangle that her white panties cover between
her parted legs
eleanors hand lowers a piece of notebook paper beneath the table on it she has written hi doug
doug starts with panic rears back cracks his head on the bottom of the table and then as his head rebounds from the blow he accidentally impales himself in his
chin with the sharp pencil
doug scrambles up from under the table with the pencil dangling from his chin knocking over his chair in the process
the tranquility of the library is destroyed by the flabbergasted reactions of the students
eleanor is momentarily concerned about his welfare but she cannot help but laugh too
doug morosely slouches along the sidewalk on his way home from school
he sports a band aid on his chin
pamela abbott pulls up alongside doug and tails him in her dodge custom royal lancer convertible with the top down
hows your chin
you want a ride
you can drive
i dont have my license yet
i dont care
the convertible speeds along the two lane blacktop with doug behind the wheel and pamela sitting next to him
how come you never ask me out
for like a date block head
i see you all the time
i dont mean hanging out
you scared of me or something
inventing the abbotts rev
i gotta job i got school i dont have time for dates and all that stuff
then forget it
its not like were
like im your boyfriend or
cutting him off i said forget it so forget it
doug sits on the ping pong table gazing at the daybed as he smokes a cigarette
his reverie is broken by helens voice calling him doug
helen and doug are at the dinner table
i wish you wouldnt smoke in the garage darling
i dont smoke in the garage
theres lots of old stuff out there i dont want anything to catch on fire
i dont smoke mom
well just the same id prefer it if youd smoke in the backyard
slight beat i gotta go gonna be late
he rises from the table and fidgets with his napkin

its friday night you know

doug walks out of the dining room
doug waits nervously for the doorbell to be answered
hes wearing a jacket and tie
pamela opens the door and reacts with surprise
what do you want
what are you doing tonight
you want to go out
i dont believe you
im baby sitting
my folks went out to dinner with peter and alice and i got tricked into watching the baby
i thought you came over to ask me out
good cause eleanor isnt here
inventing the abbotts rev
can i come in
because you know my parents arent here
maybe some other time
alices baby starts crying o
and pamela grimaces
okay but just for a little while
an episode of death valley days with commercials for mule team borax airs on the deluxe console tv
doug sits on the sofa smoking a cigarette
pamela sits at the opposite end of the sofa
youre not like jacey
so trig and polished
whats trig mean
handsome sexy sophisticated
i dont think jacey smokes a pipe
well you dont have to smoke a pipe to be trig
inventing the abbotts rev
you think im
different than eleanor
yeah real smart thats why im baby sitting and shes out having fun
slight beat eleanors smart
so how come she flunked biology
well youre no albert einstein
i got a three point two average
doesnt mean you know my sister
you might be surprised
why are we talking about eleanor
i didnt bring her up
look either youre mad at me cause youre mad at me or youre mad at me cause you like me
cause thats how girls act
i dont know much but i know that
so like which is it
doug exhales with bewilderment stubs out his cigarette then awkwardly slides down the sofa to pamela
she holds perfectly still as doug slowly moves his mouth to hers and kisses her
then he concludes the kiss to check her reaction she timidly smiles
he kisses her again with greater fervor
doug creeps his hand up her blouse and massages her breast
pamela struggles to suppress her surprise which he mistakes as a sign of her approval
emboldened by her lack of resistance he slips his hand under her bra
pam is shocked by the pleasure of the sensation then alarmed by the pace of their passion
doug kisses her again and as they kiss he stares at a framed photograph of eleanor amongst an assortment of family photos on the long table behind the sofa
it is eleanor that he is thinking of in his minds eye it is eleanors breast that he is fondling
pamela pulls her lips from his
do you love me doug
he kisses her with such ardor that she interprets his answer to be yes when in reality doug is only trying to silence her
he pulls his hand out of her blouse and slips it under her skirt
pam lurches back into the sofa jesus
he tries to kiss her again but she twists her head away
she shoves him away and jumps off the sofa
doug looks at her with breathless confusion
she turns away from him and tries to button her blouse but she cant see the buttons for her tears
she begins to sob and runs out of the room
pamela dashes up the stairs
doug comes out of the den looking for her
he is quite shaken pam
under his breath oh dammit
he slowly mounts the stairs wary of invading pamelas privacy anymore than he already has
doug finds pamela weeping in the dark hallway still fastening the buttons on her blouse
im really sorry
im not eleanor
i cant go so fast
they are both seized with fright as they hear the front door open below and peters angry voice every time we go out you have to tell that same goddamn
pam pushes doug down the hall away from the front stairs and whispers urgently get out of here
peter and alice are taking off their coats
accidentally brushing your teeth with brylcreme is a funny story
will you shut up about the fucking brylcreme
it comes in a red and white tube just like a tube of pepsodent
do you hear me alice
their baby begins to cry o
and they find pamela standing at the top of the stairs
the babys crying
doug sneaks down the back stairs and enters the kitchen as lloyd and joan enter from the garage pulling off their coats
doug ducks back into the stair landing unseen
just stay out of it joan
alice meant no harm i think
cutting her off it doesnt matter what you think its their business
alice is a spoiled brat but shes peters problem now
so just take one of your pills and go watch jack paar see what hes crying about tonight
doug sticks his head out of the back stairwell and spots peter pounding on a locked bedroom door
im warning you alice
open the damn door
trapped in the stairwell
he hisses under his breath oh shit
let me out of here
he notices a small window in the stairwell
doug squeezes out of the small window his legs dangling six feet above a large rose bush directly under him
doug makes his way along the crowded corridor showing a few of his wounds from his emergency landing in the rose bush
he slows as he nears pamela at her locker
shes aware of him but pretends that she isnt
doug hesitates as if he might say something to her but loses his nerve and continues to mope along the hallway
pams disappointment is plain to see
doug doesnt notice eleanor and a few of her girl friends approaching in the opposite direction
as they pass him eleanor smiles brightly and says hi doug
inventing the abbotts rev
the girls giggle hi doug
has become a running punchline to them
doug is so undone by their laughter that he walks into an open door
jacey collects his suitcase from the bus driver
hes become very much the ivy league man
doug waits for him beside the plymouth across the street
as jacey starts across the street a car full of young women including eleanor and sandy honks and stops beside him
jacey hops into the car and calls out to doug hey doug
get my suitcase
the car pulls away and doug irritably fetches jaceys bag
the hood on the plymouth is propped open
doug assists jacey as he replaces the fuel filter
how do you know when a girls
what do you mean ready
ready for what
theyre all ready for sex
they might not be willing but theyre ready
just have to make them think youre the only one around who has what they need
how do you do that
find out whats making them itch and scratch it
if theyre scared be dependable
if theyre bored be exciting
if theyre on the rebound catch them
what if youre not very dependable or exciting you know
pretend you are
you mean its all just fake
the sex is real
they pretend they dont want it
you pretend that you care
everybody gets what they want
but what if you really feel something for someone
really care for them
i thought you were talking about getting laid
i dont know what im talking about
the marquee reads tony curtis janet leigh the its friday night a long queue has formed at the box office window mostly teenagers but some adults too
jacey cruises past the theater in the plymouth looking for
she chats with a group of friends standing in line
she sees jacey skips over and gets into the car
lloyd abbott opens a bottle of coke that he just purchased from the vending machine
his cadillac is being fueled at the gas pumps
as he returns to his car he sees eleanor and jacey drive by the station in the plymouth
jacey and eleanor are copulating on a blanket beneath a canopy of tall trees near the river
jacey is on top eleanor has her legs clenched around his hips
come on come on come on
her encouragement inspires their mutual orgasms
jacey and eleanor approach the parked plymouth
jacey has the blanket rolled up under his arm
suddenly they are captured by a pair of headlights
lloyd abbott climbs out of his parked cadillac
what are you doing out here
lloyd absorbs this information without surrendering his composure but jacey cannot conceal his shock
get in the car
to jacey night
jacey doesnt respond to the kiss eleanor gives him but when she places her hand on his crotch he yanks her hand off
eleanor walks over and gets into the car
lloyd gazes at jacey for a beat then gets in the car and drives away
inventing the abbotts rev
doug is at the table doing homework
the doorbell rings
doug starts to get up as helen comes out of the kitchen
ill get it
helen opens the screen door and finds a well dressed woman standing in the yard with her face turned away
the woman turns it is joan abbott
helen is momentarily caught off balance by joans bristling presence
how are you
may i have a word with you helen
of course come in
no i dont have time
doug spies on joan and helen and their curious exchange through a dining room window
unable to hear their words he can only witness how their words are spoken
helen steps off the porch and approaches joan who is doing most of the talking but joan seems to require a certain distance from helen and works her way to
her chrysler town country station wagon parked at the curb
joan grows more and more agitated as she talks
eager to hear what is being said doug dashes through the living room to the front door
inventing the abbotts rev
joan has the drivers door to her station wagon open now
helen is on the sidewalk
her demeanor is measured purposefully matter of fact
i dont think thats necessary
well if i were you i would talk to him and tell him
cutting her off no im sorry joan i will not do that
if you have something to say to my son then youll have to say it to him yourself
i just thought you would like to know what hes done
and why on earth should i believe anything you say joan
joan is unable to find a quick retort she gets into her station wagon and drives away
helen notices a baseball lying in the gutter she picks it up and cleans it off with her apron
as she turns to go back to the house she finds doug standing on the porch steps
without warning she expertly pitches the baseball across the yard to doug it makes his hand sting when he catches it
helen walks up to the porch
im going to ask you one question doug and if you have no idea or dont want to answer just tell me
is there any sense you think in which jacey has
oh i dont know it sounds ridiculous
corrupted eleanor abbott
led her astray
dougs mind works in several directions at once as he tries to figure out how much he should or could tell her
inventing the abbotts rev
i know that hes
that hes slept with her
but not because hes talked about it
eleanor has lots of boyfriends
i think jacey likes her more than she likes him
long beat i see
another beat go finish your homework
doug lobs the baseball back to her and goes inside
helen sits on the porch steps and now the true toll that joans visit has taken on helen becomes apparent a bone weary sadness falls over her
her tranquility is not borne of happiness it is only a means of coping with the sadness that is at the core of her being
a drab four door chevrolet sedan with wisconsin license plates speeds away from town
incongruously the unassuming vehicle is chauffeured by an african american driver
there are two passengers in the back seat a conservatively dressed middle aged woman and eleanor abbott
there is nothing telling about eleanors countenance neither happiness nor sadness can be found on her face
doug walks home from summer school
he pauses to watch the workmen erecting the party tent in the abbotts front yard
how come youre going to summer school
doug turns to find pam at the driveway gate
i got an incomplete in u
how did you manage to do that
bates caught me drawing boobs on a picture of mamie eisenhower
laughs why do you do things like that
i wish i knew
i just cant seem to help it sometimes
are you coming to the party
doug shakes his head no
its my birthday you know
everybodys going to be here
i dont know
just come okay
doug pulls the plymouth up to the pumps
hes neatly dressed in a jacket and tie
jacey comes out of the office and leans in the car window
fill er up
frowns nice tie
oh mind if i borrow it
jacey puts the nozzle in the car as doug climbs out
i thought you didnt like those parties at the abbotts
inventing the abbotts rev
then why are you going
just doing someone a favor
how come youre not going
im persona non grata
whats that mean
you know what it means
what happened with you and eleanor
i just outlived my usefulness thats all
how were you useful to her
christ use your imagination
doug has no reply to that
eleanor was just looking for a way out
a way out of the whole abbott world
and it turns out that it takes a lot to get away
its not enough that you sleep around with boys from your world you have to fuck boys from the wrong side of the tracks
what do you mean
like guys from fountain park
no i mean me
she was fucking me
were not from the wrong side of the tracks
jacey hangs up the nozzle and screws the gas cap back on
i wouldnt go to that party if i were you
well youre not me
were just as good as the abbotts
doug hands jacey a few dollars
jacey heads for the office
you still dont know do you
doug follows jacey inside as he rings up the sale
after dad died
had an affair with lloyd abbott
thats how he got dads patent away from her
i dont believe you
believe it or not
i dont care
youre full of shit
then why dont you go ask mom
ask her what happened ask her why she doesnt have any friends ask her why shes never invited to the abbotts ask her which side of the tracks we live
jacey shoves the cash register drawer shut
inventing the abbotts rev
the party is well underway its a younger crowd tonight
the band plays fly me to the moon
doug stands apart from the others
hes ill at ease
his conversation with jacey resonates within him
as he looks over the gathering hes pained to discover how easy it is to see things the way jacey does lloyd holding court with a group of men in
joan abbott propelling a reluctant alice towards a group of guests alices age alice and peter have separated
and finally pamela dancing with a handsome young man ted
she is the belle of the ball radiant and suddenly mature in her beautiful gown
she smiles as she sees doug excuses herself and comes over to him
how long have you been here
are you okay
yes i am
come on dance with me
she pulls him towards the dance floor
you didnt tell me i had to dance
just one dance and well be even
i wont have to be mad at you anymore and you wont have to be so sorry
what am i supposed to be so sorry about
oh youre not sorry
all right yeah im sorry
sorry about what
you always do this to me
you said you werent sorry and now you say you are
so maybe im not sure what youre sorry about
im sorry for what im supposed to be sorry about
youre sorry for feeling me up
embarrassed oh shit come on pam
for crying out loud
i accept your apology
doug allows pam to pull him out onto the dance floor
he feels like a dolt but she arranges his hands on her and they begin to dance
she gazes into his eyes and smiles hi
pam is in love with doug she has been since they were children
doug is mellowed by his tender feelings for her
for a golden minute they are in pleasurable bubble of true affinity
but their bubble begins to deflate as doug sees joan abbott staring at them
her disapproval is unmistakable
doug steers pam around the dance floor to avoid joans eyes but then he sees lloyd abbott
lloyds stare is even more discomforting
pamela senses the change in dougs mood but she is unaware of the cause
is jacey home for the summer or is he just here for a visit
the mention of his brothers name at this exact moment sends a chill down dougs spine
inventing the abbotts rev
home for the summer
slight beat its cheaper if he stays here for the summer
he can save more money for school cause he doesnt have to pay rent
moneys tight you know were sort of poor
youre not poor are you
hell you kidding
even with jacey working summers my mom had to borrow against the house so he could go to penn
i dont know where the moneyll come from for me to go to college
doug sees joan abbott prompting ted to cut in on his dance with pamela
dougs bitterness swells
i hear alice and peter are getting a divorce
theyre just separated
whats the difference
i dont know youll have to ask them
so wheres eleanor tonight
just not here
is she pregnant
who said that
i dont know everybody in town is saying something different she got knocked up she ran away your old man kicked her out
so which is it
ted steps over and taps doug on the shoulder
ted is taken aback
pamelas eyes fill with tears
why do you hate me so much
excuse me asshole but
doug spins and slugs ted in the jaw sending him reeling into the other dancers
everyone pulls away from doug and pam
doug massages his fist and looks helplessly at pamela i dont hate you
the hall light is on but the bedroom is dark
doug lies on his bed still dressed
jacey appears in the doorway
doug and jacey play another hard fought game of ping pong in the garage
in the midst of a volley doug says im gonna go to penn like you
jacey snorts with incredulous laughter
youre gonna what
im going to the university of pennsylvania
i think im going to be an architect too
like hell you are
maybe we can be roommates in philadelphia
youll never get accepted to penn
besides mom couldnt afford it anyway
ill get a scholarship
i had a four point grade average and i couldnt get a scholarship so i say you got your head up your ass
jacey skillfully manipulates the volley and wins the game with a savage return that doug is unable to counter
jacey smiles puts his paddle down and walks out of the garage
doug quickly picks up a ping pong ball and hits it into the back of jaceys head
jacey turns and shoots a perturbed look at doug doug smiles night
helen looks over the merchandise
doug absent mindedly trails after his mother as he studies a large brochure about the university of pennsylvania
whats scenic design
in what context
what a minute its theatre
re brochure the howard lambert scholarship in scenic design for the theatre
its a full ride four years
pays everything almost
hell i could do that
just have to figure out what scenic design is
doug looks up from the brochure and comes face to face with a mannequin wearing a bra girdle and stockings
he almost flinches with surprise and blushes profusely ill wait for you outside ma
its snowing doug paces to keep warm
he momentarily forgets the cold as he sees pam and three of her girl friends come out of the drugstore across the street
the girls are in high spirits as they get into pams car
two well dressed townswomen muriel and doris encounter helen on their way into the apparel shop as she steps out onto the sidewalk
the women pass by helen with obvious reserve
helen is seemingly unruffled by their distant responses
she observes doug as he watches pam and her friends drive off
helen and doug walk up sidewalk towards the movie theater the marquee reads kim novak jeff chandler why dont you drop me off at home and take the car and
go out with your friends
go have some fun
why dont you
why dont i what
go hang out at the dognsuds
no go out play bridge or whatever adults do for fun
i read for fun
you read too much
you sound like your brother
come on lets go see a movie
doug and helen share a bag of popcorn as they wait for the feature to begin
came here on my very first date with charlie
saw rosalie with nelson eddy and
not jeanette macdonald
did dad kiss you
gives doug a look no
slight beat i kissed him
grins all right mom
the commencement exercises are being held in the sweltering gym to accommodate the large crowd of proud parents and family members
doug hot and uncomfortable in his cap and gown is seated among his fellow graduates behind the podium
the principal at the podium announces the names of the graduates as he calls them forward to receive their diplomas
pamela louise abbott
pamela rises from her seat and takes her diploma
lloyd and joan abbott applaud their daughter
joan stands to take a snapshot
alice is occupied with her restless and fussy eighteen month old daughter susan
doug watches pam return to her seat she avoids his eyes
helen is all smiles this is a very special day for her
the chair next to her is empty
she glances behind her and sees jacey standing in the back of the gym
jacey idly surveys the gathering with irritable boredom
he is only there at his mothers insistence
his eyes settle on
alice tries to quiet her crying eighteen month old daughter susan
lloyd makes a reprimanding aside to alice and she rises and carries susan up the aisle
jaceys eyes follow alice she notices his stare as she passes by with susan in her arms
commencement is over the parking lot is a sea of cars slowly negotiating through the mob of celebrating graduates beaming parents and rambunctious siblings
as helen slips through the crowd she is pleasantly ambushed by three second grade students of hers
she has a brief exchange with the children and then moves on
helen finds herself face to face with lloyd abbott as they both attempt to pass through a narrow space between two parked vehicles
they are both caught off guard there is no graceful way for them to squeeze past each other
congratulations to you too
wheres pam going to school
christ i forgot
inventing the abbotts rev
i should be able to remember that
it costs enough
shell do well there a very bright girl
and doug hes going to
he got a scholarship to the university of pennsylvania scenic design theater
same school as
filling in blank jacey
thank you lloyd
they pass each other and head their separate ways
their chance meeting has not gone unobserved joan abbott has been watching them from the front seat of lloyds brand new cadillac
she pretends to repair her lipstick with her compact mirror as lloyd slips behind the wheel
and helen finds jacey frowning at her
he opens the door so that she can get into the plymouth doug is already in the back seat
jacey glares at lloyd as he walks around the car and gets in behind the wheel
lloyd flips down his sun visor to block jaceys glare and pulls out of his parking spot
a waitress walks across the busy diner to helen jacey and doug at their table
helen and doug are eating their desserts jacey is content to brood over his cup of coffee
the waitress puts their bill on the table and steps away
as helen starts to open her purse webb crosby appears and picks up the bill
its on the house
oh webb really thats not necessary
how many restaurants got an ivy league busboy
thats worth a free meal
charlied be real proud of these two highbrows
yes he would
hed be extremely proud
to jacey you take good care of your little brother in philadelphia you hear me
the holt family drives home from the restaurant jacey driving helen in front and doug in the back seat
what a wonderful night
what a wonderful day
my two ivy league boys
this is torture for jacey
doug looks out the window at the striped tent in the abbotts front yard as they pass by
a party for the class of is underway as a banner on the tent proclaims
the street is lined with parked cars and busy with late coming guests
doug checks the rearview mirror for jaceys reaction but his brother keeps his eyes on the road
i never understood that tent
i wonder if they own it
im surprised they dont just leave it up all year long
slight beat lloyds mother was a tough old bird
she sold eggs
they had a place way out on ditch road near county line
that was ages ago
poor lloyd had to walk all that way in to school and then back everyday
charlie used to call lloyd egg head and he didnt mean smart
another beat im in the mood for ice cream
jacey and doug sit on the porch steps eating bowls of ice cream
helen rises from the porch swing and takes her empty bowl inside the house
i think ill have one more scoop
you want to go out to the lake and get a couple beers
no i dont want to go out to the
look i dont want you in philadelphia
i dont need you around to remind everybody that i come from hicksville u
so if youre going to go to philadelphia youre on your own dip shit
i dont need you riding my coat tails
christ why dont you get your own life
stop being my fucking shadow
doug digests jaceys insult then scoops a ball of ice cream out of his bowl with his spoon and flings the gooey ice cream into the side of jaceys face
doug rises and goes to the front door
you little prick
jacey hurls his bowl at doug it misses and shatters on the wall
missed me peckerhead
as doug opens the screen door jacey dives into him they fall into the porch swing with such force that its chains rip out of the porch ceiling and doug
jacey and the swing go overboard off the end of the porch into the shrubs
inside house doug
what was that
doug and jacey scramble to their feet their clothes are ripped and disheveled
youre dead dip shit
you gotta catch me first asshole
doug takes off with jacey in hot pursuit
a few beats later helen steps out onto the front porch and discovers her sons and the porch swing missing
jacey races up a driveway doug is nowhere to be seen
come on weasel dick
come on out you chicken shit
a collection of garbage cans explode in all directions as doug pops up from behind them and bolts down the driveway
jacey chases after him following him across the street
they pay no heed to helen in the b
standing in their front yard calling out to them douglas lee
porch lights are turning on up and down the block and the neighborhood dogs begin to howl as doug leads jacey between two houses
doug jumps up onto a tall wooden fence
he gets halfway over when jacey leaps up and grabs him and the fence collapses dumping them into a back yard vegetable garden
doug and jacey wrestle and grapple in the muddy soil cursing each other and crushing the rows of green crops
porter appears at her back door brandishing a broom
you two git
she sails into combat with her broom swinging
but doug and jacey are unwilling to give up the fight they are finally separated by a strong blast of water
they sputter for breath and discover that helen is holding the hose
helen sits in a lawn chair in the back yard wearing a large straw hat and reading a book
doug and jacey are repairing and painting the fence
helen looks up from her book that board doesnt look straight jacey
come on doug youve been painting the same spot for the last five minutes
doug and jacey clean their hands with turpentine
doug picks up a ping pong paddle and bounces the ball on it trying to see how long he can keep it bouncing
jacey finishes cleaning up picks up a paddle and then without a word doug serves the ball and they begin to volley
the plymouth drives along the two lane blacktop past the fields of tall green corn
doug is driving helen sits beside him
she reacts to something in the distance isnt that pamela abbott
in the distance pamela struggles with a jack as she tries to remove a flat tire on her convertible
doug grimaces as he recognizes her
it is pam
doug reluctantly pulls over beside pams car
shes no more pleased to see doug than he is to see her
do you need some help
its so darn hot the stupid jack just keeps sinking into the pavement
well maybe doug can give you a hand
doug frowns and slowly climbs out of the plymouth
wheres the thing that goes on the bottom of the jack
the thing the base that the jack fits into
finds it in her open trunk this
oh i thought that was just the spare tire holder on er
read your manual
pamela would slug him if his mother wasnt present
inventing the abbotts rev
doug releases the load on the jack and strains to extract it from the molten pavement
pam would you mind running doug home
id like to get to the bank before they close
holt ill drive him home
thanks for stopping
helen slides over behind the wheel and drives away
doug fumes silently while he reassembles the jack
jacey sits at the counter at the rear of the busy diner sipping an iced tea
he sees alice abbott enter she pulls a dollar bill out of her purse as she approaches the cash register near the front door
she calls out to a waitress who is fetching an order from the grill
excuse me could i get change for a dollar
the waitress is too distracted to take notice of alice and alice herself doesnt notice jacey as he steps up behind her
can i help you
yes i need change for
turns to him oh
you dont work here do you
i was just thinking about you
i was going to call you tonight
inventing the abbotts rev
theres a picnic out at river point on sunday i wanted to invite you
bring susan kids love picnics
re the dollar bill i need change for the parking meter
jacey opens his palm and reveals the correct change
alice nervously exchanges the dollar bill for the coins
do you have time for an ice tea
my mothers waiting by the car so i wont get a ticket
maybe shed like an ice tea too
no harm asking
dont do that
you know why
inventing the abbotts rev
then ill make you a deal
i just came in to get some change
come to the picnic on sunday and ill wait here and let you leave first so your mother wont see me
i dont care if my mother sees you
heads for the door then you wont care if i ask her if shed like to join us for an ice tea
jacey turns to her
i dont know if i can
it just depends
alice goes out the door as she passes by jacey he says sunday
jacey watches through the window as alice returns to the town country station wagon and puts a few coins into the meter
joan waits impatiently beside the car with susan in hand
as the abbott women walk down the sidewalk away from the diner alice glances back and sees jacey smiling at her from the diner window
pamela sits behind the wheel of her convertible listening to pat boone sing april love on the car radio
doug drips with sweat as he tightens the lugs on the spare tire
pamela climbs out and inspects his progress
inventing the abbotts rev
you think youll finish sometime today
im getting sun stroke
put the top up
stop acting like jacey
what makes you think youre so
because i know all the answers on the question because i have x ray vision and i can sing better than pat boone
and because im really a negro but dont tell anyone around here cause you know what would happen to me
god i cant even talk to you
she starts to get back into the car then turns to him
name one bad thing ive ever done to you
go on name one bad thing
whats the point
you tell me because i dont get it
look im not rich my father is
and i didnt pick my father
and if i had a choice between having tons of money or having another father id be absolutely delighted to be poor
but unfortunately life is not a cafeteria
life is not a cafeteria
you know what i mean
shit im supposed to feel sorry for you cause youre rich
well am i supposed to feel sorry for you cause youre so poor
so then just stop it
stop treating me like an abbott
well how am i supposed to treat you
inventing the abbotts rev
like you used to
like just plain pam
doug exhales as if hes winding up to apologize
and you dont have to say youre sorry and you dont have to look like somebody just ran over your dog
you just make me want to scream sometimes
doug stares at her as if hes never seen her before
what are you looking at
jacey lounges on top of a blanket beside a cooler
where is everyone
jacey sits up and finds alice standing behind him
she carries a picnic basket
other than a few children skipping rock into the river they are alone
we are everyone
but you said
overlapping no i didnt
i just said a picnic
i didnt say if anyone else was coming
alice walks away
jacey jumps up and runs after her
where are you going
inventing the abbotts rev
blocking her way you didnt come here to see everybody else
you came here to see me
thats why you didnt bring susan along
i thought you were getting a divorce
i am but its not final yet
besides im two years older than you
good if the cops come around well tell em you bought the beers in the cooler
jacey and alice wander along a path on the riverbank
i knew he would hit me
peters a real hot head
i knew if he hit me hard enough hurt me enough that even my father wouldnt stand for it
then one night i put too much soap in the washing machine and it overflowed
that did it
he punched me
broke my front tooth
what do you hear from eleanor
did you love her
we werent in love we were in heat
did you love peter
then why did you marry him
jacey holds open the drivers door as alice climbs in behind the wheel of her mothers town country station wagon
he closes the door
which tooth was it
she points to a front tooth
he leans over to look at it
i had it capped
you cant really tell can you
its a beautiful mouth
are you going to kiss me
i dont want to scare you
i cant see you again jacey
sure you can
there are ways
why am i telling all these things to you
because theres no one else you can tell them to
because im the only person you know who will admit to your face that your fathers a bag of shit
the biggest bag of shit in this town
slight beat better head home
shouldnt be gone too long
alice drives away
jacey smiles hes won
the plymouth cruises back toward town
jacey drinks a bottle of beer and happily contemplates the possibilities of a relationship with alice
he approaches a billboard that reads midwest steel desk inc
welcomes you to haley illinois
jacey drains the last of the beer and hurls the empty bottle at the billboard as he drives past it
pams convertible is parked in a weed choked yard
pam and doug hurl rocks at the windows trying to break what is left of the shattered windows on the weather beaten two story farmhouse
who do you look like more your father or your mother
hell i dont know
well what did your father look like
like a photograph
i never knew him
he died like a month before i was even born
jacey probably looks more like him than i do
jaceys named after him
thats how he got to be called jacey after his initials john charles
he died in a car wreck right
you never heard about that
well it was sort of a car wreck
he drowned or froze to death or both i dont know
he was trying to drive out to mud island
mud islands in the middle of the lake
it was winter time the lake was froze over
jesus thats pretty stupid
catches herself sorry
its all right it is stupid
he did it on a bet
he bet someone twenty bucks that he could do it
he made it all the way out there too
he went through the ice on his way back
doug and pamela sit on the ridge of the farmhouse roof they climbed out of a dormer window from the attic
i think my dad was like jacey is
some guys are just dare devils
i bet jacey once that he couldnt do a back flip off the garage roof into a big pile of leaves
and he did it
slight beat one time eleanor and i snuck out and walked around the yard naked
it was sort of a dare too
she dared me i dared her so we both did it
was this day or night
was there a full moon
i dont remember
you walked around the yard or did you like run from tree to tree
we just walked around the yard
front yard or back yard
does it matter
back yard nudity is hypocritical
people should do and say exactly what they feel or think and not try to hide things
their conversation is stifled by this new standard of absolute honesty
the sunset provides a convenient excuse for their silence
but then pam realizes he is staring at her
you look pretty
pamela takes his hand gently unfolds it and with her index finger she writes on his palm i love you
telling him took all the nerve she could muster she hasnt the stamina for a disappointing response she places her fingers on his lips to silence him
doug leans over and kisses her sweetly and tenderly and for a long time
they will always remember this kiss
the marquee reads frank sinatra edw
robinson alice abbott buys a ticket at the box office
the movie has already begun
alice enters the sparsely peopled theatre and pauses to allow her eyes to adjust to the darkness
a hand reaches out and takes her hand it is jacey
hes seated beside the door
he rises and leads her across the row of empty seats to the exit
jacey guides alice to two seats deep in the shadows of the otherwise unoccupied balcony
they gaze at the screen for a few moments then he moves his mouth to her ear and nibbles on her lobe
she turns her lips to his and they kiss passionately
jacey slides his hand under her skirt
alice presses herself against his hand and whispers inventing the abbotts rev
dont tell anyone what were doing
dont tell anyone
no one can know jacey
the station is closed and locked up for the night
jacey and alice are naked in the back seat of a car parked inside the dark service bay
it is a hot and humid night
they are slippery with sweat
thru thru helen leans out a bus window and calls to doug who is perched on the front fender of the plymouth which is parked nearby with jacey behind the
dont forget to water my tomatoes
okay mom okay
the bus pulls away
doug waves as the bus goes down the street then he leaps with surprise as an impatient jacey leans on the car horn
doug and pamela lounge on opposite ends of the sofa with his bare feet pressed against hers in a gentle shoving match
they are watching an episode of sea hunt on the how long is your mom gone
she goes up every summer to see this friend she went to college with
eleanor lives in chicago
shes going to stewardess school
what do they teach you at stewardess school
i dont know
how to wiggle your bottom
maybe you should go there instead of bryn mawr
she pushes harder against his feet and her foot slips off his and clobbers him in the crotch
he moans and sits up
it was an accident
dont be crabby
she pulls him down on top of her
she kisses the tip of his nose then blows his bangs off his forehead
you want to
i just thought maybe you were tired of just kissing
im not tired of kissing
no but touching is nice
we are touching
would like to see what you look like without any clothes on
arent you curious
no i know what i look like without any clothes on i look naked
can i touch your breasts
just on the outside
you can kiss me
i like lips
you like lips
i like your lips block head
i like being here like this
but im not taking my clothes off cause if we do that you know what well do
and im too
i dont want to be like my sisters
not if i can help it
they kiss but are almost instantly interrupted by the slam of the screen door
doug looks up and does a surprised take as he sees alice going up the stairs followed by jacey
who is it
he just went upstairs with your sister
pamela rushes out of the house with her shoes in her hand
doug chases after her in his bare feet
why didnt you tell me
hell i didnt know
what does this got to do with us
what is she doing
why is it okay for you to sneak around with me but its not all right for alice to sneak around with jacey
because im not alice
and youre not jacey
is like my mom they both get hurt so easy theyre like turtles without shells
come on take it easy
you dont know my father
you dont know how he is about jacey
he blames him for everything that happened with eleanor
eleanor fooled around with lots of guys its not jaceys fault your dad kicked her out
he didnt kick her out he put her in a nut house
he shipped her off to this clinic in wisconsin
taken aback but
i thought you said shes in chicago
she is now
they let her out a month ago
the plymouth approaches jacey turns off the headlights and kills the motor and coasts to a stop in front of the house next door to the abbotts
alice gets out of the car jacey hurries after her following her into her front yard
its the truth you know it is
no no its all just
its called making love
dont follow me
he grabs her arm and stops her
i spend all day every day just waiting and waiting to be with you waiting to forget everything you make me forget
but then when i get dressed and i come home you
leak out of me
i go into the bathroom and i wash you off of me and i remember everything
is that you
lloyds voice paralyzes them
alice steps out of the shadows and finds lloyd standing at the front door
who are you talking to
shes talking to me daddy
pamela rises from a wrought iron bench in another part of the yard she strolls over to alice
just girl talk
you can talk inside
pamela and alice go inside the house
jacey exhales he is ashen
doug hoses down the sidewalk in front of the restaurant
pamela pulls up in her car and gets out
ive been thinking maybe we shouldnt see each other right now
if my father
i dont really care what would happen to me if he found out i was seeing you but i have to take care of alice and my mother and eleanor
well it would be hard for me to do that if i were in the doghouse too
christ why do you have to take care of them
shrugs no one else will
he struggles to hold his anger and frustration in check
see you around
pams composure begins to weaken but she quickly returns to the car before she can lose control
doug turns the hose back on
he doesnt look up as she drives away
helen rinses off some just picked vegetables
she turns off the faucet then pauses in reaction to something
helen approaches the foot of the stairs drying her hands with a dish towel
she listens for a beat then steps out on the front porch
doug is brushing a coat of green enamel on the repaired porch swing
whos upstairs with jacey
long beat how long is she likely to stay
i dont know but i wouldnt hold up dinner
doug rinses the dirty dinner dishes in the sink
helen hears the screen door slam as she fetches a clean tablecloth from the buffet
she puts the tablecloth on the table starts for the kitchen then hesitates
jacey stands on the porch watching the taillights of alices car disappear into the night
helen appears behind the screen door
do you want dinner
dont sit on the swing doug just painted it
slight beat i had to bring her here today
she couldnt see me tonight and there was nowhere else we could go
i can appreciate that jacey but
i love her mother
im going to marry her
do her parents know about this
of course not
dont you think they should
i dont give a damn about them
does alice feel the same as you do
she loves me
has she agreed to marry you
she needs time
its not easy for her
how does hiding it from her family make it any easier
we dont have any choice
alice is a grown woman shes a mother with a child of her own if she really loves you then she should
cutting her off all that matters is that i get her away from them before they find out
i cant be a party to that jacey
i dont need your help
im not asking for it
slight beat youll have to find somewhere else to take alice i cant have you bringing her here again
she steps away from the screen door
alice comes in the front door and goes up the stairs
where have you been
susie cut her finger on the piano pedal
theyre as sharp as razor blades
joan steps into the entry hall
inventing the abbotts rev
did you hear me
susan cut her finger on the piano pedal
alice disappears at the top of the stairs
it is almost two oclock in the morning
helen has dozed off in her chair with a book on her lap
she is startled awake by a loud banging at the front door
helen hurries to the door and opens it
pamela is on the porch
she is out of breath and very distraught
her car is parked in the middle of the street with its lights on and motor pamela are you all right

jacey comes down the stairs pulling on his bathrobe
doug appears on the stairs behind him
alice took some pills some of my mothers pills

please dont make things worse
pamela dashes back to her car
as jacey walks down the remainder of the stairs and watches pamela speed away
helen closes the front door and turns to say something to jacey but he cuts her off leave me alone just leave me alone
helen climbs the stairs collects doug at the top landing and leads him away
jacey punches his fist through a glass pane of the sheer curtained sidelight beside the front door
doug is mowing the front lawn
the drone of the lawn mower accompanies jaceys pacing
his face is haggard and unshaven
he glances out the window and sees something that sends him bolting out of his bedroom
inventing the abbotts rev
pams convertible barely comes to a halt at the curb before jacey comes charging out of the house to pam
doug is occupied with the lawn mower he doesnt notice pam and jacey at first
jacey and pam have to speak over the din of the lawn mower
how is she
shes all right
can i see her
at the boathouse at the lake
jacey turns and dashes up the driveway
doug watches jacey jump into the plymouth and speed down the driveway and then up the street
doug shuts off the lawn mower and walks over to pam
whats going on
she looks at doug with tears in her eyes
i had to
for alices sake
puzzled had to what
tell jacey im sorry
pam drives away
the plymouth skids to a stop behind the abbotts town country station wagon
jacey jumps out of his car and rushes into the boathouse
jacey discovers lloyd abbott waiting for him
inventing the abbotts rev
i have plans for my daughters mr
holt and they dont include you
i know you
i know you better than you know me
i know all there is to know about screwing your way into a wealthy family
ill never let you screw your way into mine
where is she
jacey turns and rushes out of the boathouse
jacey hops into the plymouth and peels out as he speeds away
lloyd abbott steps out of the boathouse and approaches the station wagon
jacey speeds recklessly back into town
jacey skids into the driveway and leaps out of the car
jacey bursts through the front door and cries out
joan abbott rushes into the entry hall
where is she
who do you think you are
dammit where is she
inventing the abbotts rev
get out of here
lloyd abbott steps in the front door and drops his car keys into the silver bowl on the hall table
call the police joan
joan hurries away
you son of a bitch
where is she
behind you mr
jacey turns and sees alice standing at the top of the stairs
she is pale and drawn and wearing a bathrobe
come with me
please alice just come with me now right now
i told you
she walks out of view
lloyd steps up behind jacey and says softly but with piercing intensity now get out of here you runt stud
and keep your poor boy dick out of my daughters
jacey turns and stares at lloyd then brushes past him on his way out the door
jacey haphazardly packs his suitcases
his emotions have been spent
helen stands in the doorway
inventing the abbotts rev
why spend all night and half the day tomorrow waiting in chicago for the philadelphia bus
why not just wait and take the morning bus to chicago
the sooner i get out of this fucking town the better
slight beat stung suit yourself
jacey doesnt look out the window as the bus on its way out of town drives past the illuminated billboard that reads midwest steel desk inc
welcomes you to haley illinois
doug and helen sit across from each other neither one has much of an appetite
they eat in silence for a few moments then dammit
why cant he just leave them alone
i dont know why
why couldnt he just forget em
just pretend they didnt even exist
if the abbotts didnt exist jacey wouldve had to invent them one way or another
there are no ends of abbotts in the world if thats what you need
inventing the abbotts rev
and he just needs that somehow
well actually i know how
she rises and picks up her plate
helen carries her plate to the sink
doug follows her in
what do you mean how do you know
she sits at the kitchen table and sighs as if coming around to some central hard truth
i was just a wreck when charlie died
inventing the abbotts rev
jacey was almost two and i was eight months pregnant with you and
well some mornings id be crying before i even woke up
then you were born
and jacey just got lost in there
i didnt have anything for him
mother took him over
hed cry or call for me and then id hear mother answer him and id go back to sleep
sighs bitterly i shouldve taken us away from here gone somewhere else
after charlie died lloyd abbott started dropping by on his way home from work
he felt so bad about that bet charlie made with him at the lake
that foolish idiotic bet
poor lloyd i felt sorry for him
hed have a cup of coffee with mother and me
if a doorknob had come off hed fix it
hed carry the garbage cans to the curb
someone dies people try to be helpful
but he was by here so often that people started to talk
it was fairly obvious that he wanted something more from me than just a cup of coffee
i suggested that he didnt need to stop by here so often but
then one afternoon i was at woolworths having lunch at the counter
all of sudden joan abbott was standing there screaming and yelling at me to stop sleeping with her husband with lloyd
i was speechless
she was gone before i could find my tongue
stunned almost ill christ
i went to see joan i tried to talk to her to put her mind at ease but
dammit why didnt lloyd tell her that nothing had happened
im sure he did but men always say that darling
besides lloyd was always having affairs
hes that type of man
why did everyone in town believe joan abbott
because shes joan abbott
if you cross joan you dont get invited to her parties and the abbotts have the best parties in town
the only parties
i hate this town
i hate the abbotts
he slaps the back of a chair and knocks it over
im sorry doug i shouldnt have told you
i already knew
people still talk about it
no ive never heard anyone talk about it
not to me
then how did
inventing the abbotts rev
he knows too
but he thinks it really happened
helen is overcome with tears
doug stares at her helplessly
hes never seen his mother weep before
the bus cruises along the two lane blacktop
doug stares out the window
partygoers enter building
a vintage third floor railroad flat sparsely furnished and neat as a pin
jacey is hosting a party
a tony bennett record when somebody breaks your heart plays on the hi fi
the apartment is elbow to elbow with penn men and attractive coeds from radcliffe mt
hollyoke and byrn mawr
doug sits in the middle of the sofa wedged between two coeds having separate but equally animated conversations with two of jaceys classmates who are perched on the arms of
doug wears a jacket and tie but his knack at looking out of place is intact
jacey is apart from the others wooing a gorgeous co ed in a tight cashmere sweater
airplanes bridges skyscrapers bras all utilize the same fundamentals of structural design
with his finger he traces the back strap of her bra beneath her sweater
inventing the abbotts rev
a stable foundation that resists compression
his finger trails the shoulder strap of her bra
carefully calculated suspension
he draws his fingertip around the outside of her breast to the lower front of her bra
and cantilevered elements to provide support
the co ed is bothered but none the less bewitched
you know im engaged
so am i
shocked you are
im engaged in conversation with you
jacey smiles and then kisses her
doug is spying on them from the safety of the crowd
jacey winks at doug
doug shakes his head in wonder
doug walks along the sidewalk towards the entrance of the theater carrying some rolled up plans under his arm
he reacts as he sees hey
pamela abbott walks across the quad
pam is years old now her beauty in full bloom
doug jogs over to her
what are you up to
i come down to use the library sometimes or go shopping
hows bryn mawr
i got to catch the bus back

its been a long time

i have to go to this party
the traffic light changes and the other pedestrians cross the street
just a party i got roped into going
maybe some other time okay
i mean it really
just call im at reed hall
inventing the abbotts rev
doug watches her cross the street
doug is revising a set design deeply concentrating on his task
hes startled by a knock on the door
you got a visitor downstairs
doug comes down the wide stairs with a puzzled look on his face
he stops at the front desk and the student clerk points to another part of the lobby
doug walks across the cavernous lobby and finds pamela abbott slumped in a chair
did you miss the bus
pam laughs and doug suddenly realizes damn youre drunk
i better get you out of here before the puritans tar and feather you
can you walk
pam awkwardly rises and doug guides her to the door
listen to me go out the front door turn right go around to the side of the building and wait for me by the fire escape
pamela leans against the side of the building as the fire escape ladder descends to the pavement
doug climbs down
come on up we go
pam keels over and vomits
pam sits on the bed as doug pulls her stained turtleneck sweater off over her head shes wearing a bra
what were you drinking sterno
hold on we got to get your pants too
can you stand up
as she collapses on the bed no you cant stand up
he undoes the waist of her pants and tugs on her pant legs but her panties start to slide off along with her pants
nope nope lets keep the panties on okay
can you hold on to your underpants
shes out ill hold on to your underpants
he holds her panties in place while he struggles to get her pants over her hips
doug rinses out pams clothes in a sink
pams wet clothes have been draped over the radiator
pam is passed out tucked in under the covers
doug sits on the edge of the bed gently cleaning her face with a damp washcloth
doug stirs from his sleeping spot on the floor he slept with his clothes on
he notices that pams clothes have been removed from the radiator
he sits up and finds that the bed is empty
pamela approaches her dorm carrying an armload of books
she starts up the steps then stops when she sees doug
im sorry doug
suddenly alarmed oh jesus
oh jesus did we what
what do you think
well i know you might find this hard to believe but i dont sleep with drunks
he walks away
she calls after him
doug lounges on his bed reading a textbook
it is raining outside
he is startled by a tapping on the windowpane
pamela is outside on the fire escape
he ignores her
open the window
come on im freezing
he gets out of bed unlatches the window then returns to the bed and his book
pamela opens the window with difficulty and climbs in
she drapes her wet coat over the radiator and sits in the desk chair
if you feel like youre gonna puke use the wastebasket there
i am so sorry
i was embarrassed
i didnt know where i was when i woke up
i felt like i was dying so i just
i was going to call you
doug doesnt respond he turns the page of his book
i dont know
i was blotto
i mean i was so happy to see you
then i just got sad
i got sad
it happens you know
doug snaps his book shut
you want to hear something stupid
when i was cleaning you up wiping the puke off your face i suddenly realized how much i miss you how much i love you
hows that for stupid
pam is stung by his flippancy she begins to cry
what are you crying for
i love you
but its too late
everythings too screwed up
doug kneels in front of her and anxiously tries to console her
no no its not too late
its perfect timing
were on our own now
no jacey and eleanor or jacey and alice
thats what stinks about being the youngest we have to sweep up after everybody else
but now its just us
its our turn
how can you be in love with me
how can you be in love with me
cause ive always have been
he kisses her then he gazes at her and strokes her hair
you want to see something
doug and pam hurry along the rain swept sidewalk towards the theater
the large theater is dark except for a single work light standing on the bare stage
inventing the abbotts rev
doug leads pam by the hand down the aisle from the lobby
what are we doing here
i want to show you something
he escorts her up a short flight of steps and positions her center stage near the footlights
just stand right there
he takes the work light with him as he walks off stage
then with a metallic clank everything goes dark
its all right dont move
theres the rumble and squeak of a piece of scenery being rolled onto stage then the swoosh of a backdrop being lowered from the fly loft
we hear doug running somewhere backstage then a beautiful sunset slowly illuminates the stage creating the perfect mood for the modestly scaled stylized set that doug has put into place
it is the roof of a weathered farmhouse with a dormer window and a tall brick chimney
doug steps on stage hes a bit winded from his quick change routine
oh doug its beautiful
the senior acting class does scenes from different plays they invite everybody its a real big deal
so theres this competition among all the theater design students to do the sets
and anyway im the one whose design got picked
inventing the abbotts rev
what scene is it for
a tad embarrassed umm
romeo and juliet
its something different i think thats why they picked it
everybody else was doing castles and stuff
rooftop romeo and juliet by douglas l
youre really good at this
its like building models when i was a kid
you know they tore that old farmhouse down
they always tear down the wrong stuff
oh jesus i missed you so much
missed you too
they kiss then pamela pulls away
doug studies her then you have a boyfriend right
you worried what your old man would think
inventing the abbotts rev
he doesnt care what i do as long as i dont do it in haley
then whats the problem
we dont have to go so fast
shit im sorry
i blew it again huh
no i did
pam climbs down off the stage and starts up the aisle
im on probation
they pulled a bed check the night i was here
i have to be back in the dorm by ten
what about tomorrow
i could come up in the afternoon and
its just too late
its all messed up
i cant seem to make things all right
the more i try the worse everything gets
pam walks up the aisle and disappears through a door to the lobby
its not too late
inventing the abbotts rev
pam enters the lobby
a female student clerk displays a message as pam passes by the front desk
pam some guy named doug keeps calling for you
pam ignores the clerk and the message and goes upstairs
pamela approaches her dorm
she stops as she sees doug waiting beside the entrance
she turns and walks away
doug still waiting beside the entrance for some sign of pam
hes tired cold and hungry
he grinds out his cigarette with his heel and walks away
jacey sits in his favorite armchair reading the sunday newspaper
doug sits in the middle of the sofa
jacey scrutinizes his brooding younger brother
whats wrong with you
a boiling water kettle starts to whistle o
jacey goes into the kitchen to tend to it
there is a soft knock on the front door
doug goes to answer it
he opens the door and finds pamela standing there with her coat in her hand
he is pleasantly surprised pam is distant slightly off balance
inventing the abbotts rev
how did you know i was here
you want another cup of
jacey steps out of the kitchen and frowns when he sees pam
i told you not to come by on sundays
the breath goes out of doug as if hed been struck in the stomach
dammit why didnt you call first
didnt have any nickels
well i didnt expect to see you again
you want to fuck
i mean thats why you came over right
slight beat sure
then take off your clothes
pamela drops her coat on the floor
she pulls her sweater off over her head
dougs anguish is as great as pamelas humiliation
he cannot bear any more if this he walks out the door
doug comes out of the apartment house and walks up the sidewalk
tears begins to stream down his face
he begins to run and run as fast as he can
doug enters the dormitory and starts up the stairs
inventing the abbotts rev
doug turns and finds jacey at the foot of the stairs
doug continues up the stairs jacey pursues him
i didnt know
you didnt know what
how you felt about pam
apologize to her you asshole
slight beat i ran into her a few weeks ago at a party
she was drinking and i
it was easy
she felt guilty about telling her father about alice and me
actually i made her feel guilty i made her feel like she had betrayed alice
she didnt betray alice
she was just trying to get rid of you so alice wouldnt try to kill herself again
jesus christ you shit head alice couldnt marry you
i mean i do now
then what the hell did pam ever do to deserve your revenge
just your way of evening the score with lloyd abbott right
doug spins and delivers a wild roundhouse punch that lands brutally on the side of jaceys face the impact knocks him down onto the steps
jaceys eyebrow has split open he is blinded by blood
i dont know you
i dont know who the fuck you are
you fuck everything
you fuck everything up
why did you have to fuck pam too
doug walks away leaving jacey sitting on the steps clutching a banister for support
he presses his palm to his eyebrow to squelch the flow of blood
doug approaches pams dormitory
doug steps up to the female student clerk at the front desk
pamela abbott please
tell her doug is here
shes not here
but she left
what do you mean
inventing the abbotts rev
where did she go
i dont know
well did she go home
no one seems to know
she just took some clothes and left
lost oh god
his pain is so clear that it spurs the clerks sympathy
look im not supposed to do this but
well i can give you her home address
explodes with irony shit
slight beat i mean
i know her home address
the abbott house is decked with snow
doug sits behind the wheel of the plymouth
hes parked down the street
he smokes a cigarette and stares at the house the pavement outside the drivers window is littered with butts
alice comes out on the street laden with packages and shopping bags
shes startled by doug when he falls in beside her and follows her down the sidewalk
i dont know
is she with eleanor
inventing the abbotts rev
i dont know
i dont know
i couldnt find eleanors name in the chicago phone book
maybe its unlisted
well do you know eleanors address
i dont know her address i dont know her phone number
youd have to ask my father for it
alice turns and steps into another shop leaving doug behind on the sidewalk
perry como sings the little drummer boy on the television
doug rises from the sofa
helen is peeling apples to make a pie
doug enters and studies her for a beat
are you okay
just a cold
inventing the abbotts rev
i do wish jacey had come home for christmas
maybe thats whats wrong with me
i guess that free lance drafting job was too good for him to turn down
i dont think thats why he didnt come home
i wrote him a letter you know
about lloyd and me
has he mentioned it to you
doug wants to avoid the topic of jacey
he opens the refrigerator
when did you start drinking beer
i bought those for you
i had them in the basement i kept forgetting to bring them up
he does a bemused take on her
good heavens i know you drink beer
doug takes out two bottles of beer and opens them
have one with me
i bought those for you honey
its not good to drink alone mom
dont be silly
have a beer
he pulls out a chair for her
she reluctantly comes over and sits down
doug sits and proposes a toast
takes a sip its beer
lets drink em all
helen laughs girlishly
charlie was always trying to get me to drink beer
why do you always call him charlie
that was his name
why dont you ever say your father
sometimes i do dont i
i dont know
when i think of him i think of charlie
did you ever
meet anybody else
you mean another man
well everyone always thinks things are more possible than they are
i mean single men dont stay in haley if they have any starch
the only eligible man around was drew carter but he smells like his dog
inventing the abbotts rev
her remark cracks doug up helen laughs too
i wish id remembered the beers sooner
its nice to see you smiling
everyone has sad times
doug dissolves into tears
he lowers his head and shields his eyes with his hand
helen leans over and strokes his hair
after a few moments he rises and wipes away his tears with a dish towel
ill tell you a secret
i did have a friend
a man in chicago
i used to see him when i went up to chicago to visit bea during summer vacations
used to see him you dont see him anymore
did you like him
he was a wonderful man
a little boring but really very wonderful
how long did this go on
about eight years or so it was when you boys were still at home
thats a long time
did you ever think about marrying him
but well obviously i said no
because im in love with
with my memory of him
he was the one for me
oh i dont know
theres different kinds of love darling
some people you love no matter what
other people you love if the situation is right
to me the best kind of love is the no matter what kind
slight beat well i am a cheap drunk arent the bus cruises along the narrow ribbon of pavement
sitting by himself theres not many passengers today
we hear the voices of rambunctious children
the second grade students are in the midst of an art project where they make a design by gluing various sorts of dried beans to colored paper but the beans
are being thrown about the room and other beans have been spilled on the floor
helen wearily attempts to rein in the unruly children too much noise please
lets finish up
keep the glue on the paper
sam lillian jack in your seats please
helen suddenly loses her energy and interest in policing the children
their hijinks continue as she steps out of the classroom
inventing the abbotts rev
helen steps over to a window and stares out lost in her own thoughts and oblivious to the noise from her classroom
doug is on a cat walk in the fly loft high over the stage floor
he strains as he drops pound slabs of pig iron onto a counterweight carriage then he releases the line and flies a canvas backdrop up into the loft
he locks off the line wipes his brow turns and finds jacey standing behind him
what the hell do you want
doug sits in an almost empty terminal waiting to catch a red eye flight to chicago
a group of just arrived stewardesses pass by chatting with a captain and other flight officers
eleanor abbott does a take on doug steps away from her co workers and doubles back to him
doug almost doesnt recognize her
she is twenty years old now and very grown up very stylish in her stewardess uniform
she smiles at him
hows your chin
as he doesnt respond remember
i have a little scar

i dont know where she is
i gotta run ill miss my ride to the hotel

eleanor looks at him
just tell her that
eleanor doesnt reply
she turns and walks away
the distance between jacey and doug is telling as is the difference in their behavior
doug leans against a wall with his hands in his pockets his eyes cast down on his shoes
jacey roams the alley unable to stand still for grief
he lights a fresh cigarette off the butt of another
why didnt she tell us
the funeral director appears in the back door gentlemen
helens closed casket is surrounded by floral tributes
doug and jacey enter from a door near the casket they pause in reaction to the crowded parlor it overflows with mourners
jacey explodes under his breath so that only doug can hear fucking hypocrites every one of em
jacey turns and walks out through the door they came in
doug walks over to his seat in the front row he hesitates when he sees lloyd abbott standing in the back of the parlor
doug sits at the table wrapping dishes in newspaper
jacey comes in with a framed photograph of their grandmother
do you want this picture of grandma
you can have it
jacey steps out of the dining room
jacey is packing helens things
doug steps in the doorway
you want to go get something to eat
jacey is caught a bit off guard by dougs invitation then sure
jacey and doug are seated in a window booth
they eat in silence then you dont have to stick around
i can handle things here
what about school

inventing the abbotts rev
i should live my own life

long beat im sorry

slight beat did you have to get stitches
my eyebrow yeah ten stitches
doug takes an envelope out of his coat pocket and puts it on the table
found this in one of the boxes in the basement
what is it
a letter of agreement between lloyd abbott and dad
dad sold him the file drawer patent not mom
jacey opens the envelope and studies the yellowed document
re document a car
he sold the patent for a used car
used cars were the only kind of cars around
the war was on everything was mobilized
they stopped making new cars they were making tanks and bombers in detroit
and even midwest steel wasnt making desks they were making ammo boxes and mortar shells
how did you get to be such an expert on world war two
history high school
i should be an expert i had to take the damn class twice
i guess dad needed a car and he figured who the hell needed a full suspension file drawer
reading aloud desoto coupe convertible as is
wonder whatever happened to it
he parked it at the bottom of the lake
doug follows jacey to the door of the bus
neither one of them knows how to say good bye after an awkward beat
fighting back tears do me a favor
dont stand here and wave good bye
it makes me think of mom
doug turns and walks away
jacey climbs onto the bus
doug drives home from the bus depot in the old plymouth
he slows as he sees
the party tent in the abbotts front yard with its canvas sides rolled up
susans third birthday party is underway dozens of well dressed children and their parents are in attendance
alice who is very pregnant and peter vanlaningham and lloyd and joan abbott watch susan riding her new pony a gift from her grandparents
a new generation of abbott parties has begun
a for sale sign has been placed on the front yard
doug pulls up the driveway in the plymouth
he turns off the engine but doesnt get out of the car
then he starts the car again and backs out of the driveway
despite it being a birthday party for a three year old this is very much a grown up affair
the band is playing the adults are dancing joan abbott is flitting from guest to guest alice is dutifully silent while peter dominates the talk at their table lloyd is
with his cronies
doug enters the tent one by one the guests take notice of him as he works his way across the tent and all are very aware of his uninvited presence
by the time he reaches lloyd abbott
lloyd scrutinizes doug then what do you want
i want to talk to you
doug follows lloyd into the dark paneled room
shut the door
doug closes the door
lloyd lights a cigarette
i dont want to
slight beat im sorry about your mother
sorry about what
you didnt know your mother at all if you think someone like me wouldve ever stood a chance with someone like her
that just goes to show you how stupid this town is that theyd believe she slept with me
thatd make charlie laugh
your old man was my best friend
he used to call me egg head hell everybody did
and back then everybody knew that egg head abbott didnt stand a snowballs chance in hell with helen riley
of course that was all before i became lloyd abbott mr

charlie holt was the only one good enough for helen

inventing the abbotts rev
i never knew what to say to a girl

but i couldnt talk
except with your mother except with helen
i talked more to her after your dad died than id ever talked to any woman before then or since then
jesus i talked
just like this
just like right now
just pouring out
helen would listen and whatever i said shed never make me feel bad or ignorant or guilty
for christs sake she never blamed me for what happened at the lake for letting charlie drive out on that ice
she never did anything but try to make me hurt less and i
lloyd is startled by joan as she opens the door
get out of here
its time for susies birthday cake
exploding goddammit joan go way
get the hell out of here
leave me alone
he hurls his glass at her and it shatters on the door jamb
joan recoils in dumb founded shock and backs out of the doorway
lloyd fumes over and slams the door shut in her face
he leans against the door and catches his breath
i wanted sons isnt that funny
i wanted sons and i got three daughters
i wanted a woman i could talk to and i got a woman whose ears are stuffed full of money and percodan
but i got the chicken shit off my shoes
inventing the abbotts rev
my shoes are clean
slight beat i know thats what jacey thinks
i could always tell by the way he looked at me even when he was a little boy like i owed him something
but goddammit hes wrong
that bet was your fathers idea and i never meant your mother any harm
i wouldve done anything for her anything
i loved her
but the only thing she ever wanted from me was just for me to leave her alone
he pours himself a fresh drink then turns to doug so what do you want
i want to find pam and youre going to tell me where she is
doug navigates the busy sidewalk to the entrance of the building
he checks the number over the door to the address on the scrap of paper in his hand
doug knocks on the door
eleanor opens it shes dressed for work in her stewardess uniform
shes obviously surprised to find doug on her doorstep but she greets him with a warm smile
where is she
pamela dresses a mannequin in the display window
as she moves behind the mannequin to fasten a garment she sees doug standing on the other side of the glass watching her from the sidewalk
doug writes a message on the plate glass window with his index finger printing the letters in reverse so that the message is legible from pams pov his message reads
i love you
inventing the abbotts rev
pamela comes out of the store via the revolving door and finds doug waiting for her on the sidewalk
how can you
how can i what
you always loved me no matter what i did right
maybe thats how i love you no matter what
thats the best kind of love you know
how do we start all over again
pams eyes fill with tears
doug steps over to her and embraces her tenderly holding her close
were doing it
through her tears doing what
so what are you doing tonight
you want to go out
some people never change
he wipes her tears from her cheeks with his fingers then gives a short but sweet kiss
then he smiles
