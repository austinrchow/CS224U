written by jenny lumet kym a darkly beautiful girl in her early s is smoking furiously on the porch of an urban halfway house
she glances impatiently at her watch and presses her ear to her cell phone
as she exhales we hear the rumble of thunder
irritated she crams her cell phone into her bag
rosa a halfway house staff nurse is patiently handling walter an irate patient who is screeching
i want my fucking zippo now
walter starts yanking at his hair
walter that is a behavior
raking his nails against his forearm fuck you
and you are making a choice
her cell phone rings
to walter hold on
dont you get it yet waldo
shes making a choice not to give you your lighter because youll torch the self help library again
kill anybody recently
run anybody over with a fucking car
kym grinds her cigarette under her heel and blows smoke but gives no signal that shes heard anything
she yanks her cell phone out of her bag as
a tan mercedes station wagon pulls up in front of the house
to kym that them
rosa takes two of kyms several bags
they are oddly matched
a coach tote a fake prada a gristedes bag and a world wildlife fund tote bag
youre not letting her get behind the wheel are you
walter you are only responsible for yourself
to kym this is all your stuff
you know you never gave me your cell number
sotto it was a mistake
im lucky i didnt get fired
weve discussed this
she offers her hand good luck
kym doesnt appear to have heard her but she shakes the hand barely
so very very faintly
kyms dad paul buchman a tired prosperous man in his late s steps around the car and trots up the porch steps
he is wearing a big smile and his glasses are foggy
kym talks rapidly over his shoulder
oh my god
here you are
i thought you were going to abandon me in rehab
you guys are half an hour late
ive been standing here with these lunatics
you look so great
paul offers his hand to rosa
im paul buchman
we met last time you came up
doesnt remember of course of course
lets go lets go
where is everybody
carol a handsome woman in her s waves from the car
loudly hey carol
how are ya
so wheres rachel
carol wheres rachel
kym slides into the back seat as paul loads the car
getting everything ready at the house
there is so much going on at the house i cant tell you
you know your sisters doing all of it herself
eyeing the rearview mirror as she arranges her bangs my sister is bending the environment to her will
no wedding planners or anything like that
just her and sidney and a lot of their friends
she is so thrilled youre here
is that everything sweetheart
distractedly rifling through her bag yah
can we go
is there anyone you want to say goodbye to
the station wagon travels through a constantly changing series of environments as they journey out of new york city on their drive to suburban connecticut
right away though kym lights up a cigarette and paul and carol crank their windows
so are all these busy young wedding helpers staying at the house
because after eight months of constantly revolving cell mates and crazy people
you werent in a cell kym
and groups groups groups
and nobody was crazy nobody was in a rubber room
i was looking forward to a little privacy for once
the only extra person staying at the house is emma whos actually been staying in your old room
but she can move i guess
rachel and emma
kym contd the only two people on the planet less capable of delegating than hannibal
on the eve of a wedding
its a nightmare so bad its in german
rachel must be totally freaking out
is she too tense
shes a wigwam
right on top of him rifling through her bag again is she eating
or are all her latent food issues rearing their heads
is she hoarding snickers and cool whip under the bed like in high school
she never did put that one to sleep
genuine i dont think that thats a problem for her
no offense dad but you never thought that was a problem for her
itll be great to see her
foodies are the worst though
they never get it together
there were six of them on my floor in the hospital and you could never get into the bathroom
they would cry at the chocolate pudding and one of them was a guy
i cant wait to see mom
youll see her and andrew at the rehearsal dinner tonight
can we stop at the please
i feel nauseous
i need something to drink
i brought you a diet coke
she offers the can
i prefer pepsi from the fountain
carol looks at paul
he is fiddling with the dashboard
kym fills her big gulp at the fountain and pays at the counter
the counter girl gives her change
i saw you on cops
kym appears not to have heard
she pockets her change and leaves
as paul drives through a bucolic well to do neighborhood featuring a beautiful old church
the station wagon pulls into a circular driveway lined with trees and bushes of beautiful blue hydrangea
there are several late model cars parked in the driveway of the sprawling shingled house
young people crawling everywhere in the midst of wedding preparation wrapping garlands and hanging paper lanterns
a little girl tosses rose petals in the swimming pool
the atmosphere is slightly punch drunk and friendly
paul unloads kyms bags
ill do it dad
kym charges into the house where norman sklear and more friends of rachel are decorating
they stare at her as she runs up the stairs to the second floor
camera runs all the we hear
can we raise this hem half an inch
here let me just
kym slams open the master bedroom door and finds her older sister rachel trying on her wedding dress with the help of her best friend emma
radiant and sexy rachel glows like an angel in her creamy white and gold sari
emma has pins in her mouth and a tape measure around her neck
oh my god you are just mi nute
to kym you cant smoke in here rachel and kym squeal and embrace
rachel is slightly awkward as emma frantically tries to keep the billowing fabric from combustion
i have pins all over me
you look great
rehab makes you fat
all the vending machines
look at you missy
id swear to god you were puking again
to rachel no seriously youre so tiny its like youre asian
dad wants us to sleep in the same room so youll be able to watch me while hes asleep and i wont sneak out of the house and blow dealers
and shoot heroin
dad did not say blow dealers
i told him id just sleep in ethans room
you can always shoot up in the tree house
a little too loud
kym im not remotely surprised youre starting your drama already however its rachels wedding and this week its about her
emma you still have your tiny core of rage
what a relief
kym flops on the bed and gazes adoringly at her sister for a moment
rachel beams back
so are you an actual shrink yet
even though youre like twelve years old
you know the difference right
you should prescribe something soothing for emma
i will have my phd
in a year and a half
and psychologists dont get prescription pads right kym
they do in guam
would you please put that out
emma designed this dress and theres forty seven yards of it and ill go up like the hindenburg
kym takes a last drag even though shes down to the filter then flushes the butt down the toilet in the tiny bathroom
over the flushing toilet since when are you a designer emma
she has this great little boutique in greenwich
she says things like you need a fabulous jersey pant
thats so great
i think i heard that
isnt this your fifth incarnation or something
werent you an actress
all the n
s in the hospital were actresses
non specified eating disorder
they were constantly doing leg lifts under the sheets
angela paylin is coming to the wedding
right on top of her i ate so much cookie dough and did so many whip its with angela paylin
and she confessed to you her secret elvis stoyko fantasy
i spied on you
oh my god
elvis stoyko the figure skater
in her fantasy she was wearing her hair up and very serious responsible eyeglasses because she was a world renowned judge at the winter olympics for mens figure skating
and elvis stoyko was skating in the finals to could it be magic for the gold medal
and just when barry manilow is singing now now now and hold on fast
theres this electric connection between them and he stops in the middle of his triple lutz
and he skates over to the judges table all panting and sweaty with his spangly neil diamond shirt open to the chest
there is silence as he stops in front of her their eyes lock and he reaches for her hand
and angela takes it
to the roar of the crowd and the shock of the olympic judges
kym contd and he pulls her out of her chair undoes her hair and they skate as a pair to the rest of the song
and he gets disqualified but he doesnt care
whered she get the skates from
they collapse in laughter
kym studies her ass in the mirror
i should call her right this second
is she really coming
who are all these energetic young people decorating the house
shes got everyone she knows pulling elf duty
squinting at her ass what about me
what am i doing
rachel and emma exchange a look
well i think youll be assisting on floral detail
i want everything all drippy and luxurious and moms a little bit tasteful moms in charge of flowers
and i dont want to upset her
to kym and youre such a diplomat
im like kofi annan
in rehab they said i was the maternal hub of my peer group
i was always the referee for softball
i was the only one who could convince the methamphetamine freaks that no one was chasing them when they ran around the bases
someone was chasing them
they have trust issues in the first place
im going downstairs to find olive and get some unconditional love
kym swans out of the room
anyway im doing some lighting
i already got the candles and everything
rachel and emma share a look
forget mom and me and the fucking flowers
kym crosses the hall to ethans room and opens the door
speaking of dawgs when am i going to meet this fiancee of yours anyway
he went to get stuff with kieran
theyll be back
a little boys bedroom
a single bed a window some games
some stuff in boxes
not a mausoleum
kym enters ethans room
she stands there looking around
she takes a moment
kym wandering the upstairs hallway
the winding corridors are a little spooky despite the openness and light it feels haunted up here
looking into her old bedroom seeing emmas stuff inside
paul comes to the bottom of the stairs yelling up
im making hot dogs and hungabungas
who wants what
rachel and emma shout back down
its too hot
i dont eat gluten paul
what dont you eat
kym appears down the back stairway behind paul not shouting
besides im in my dress
can i see
paul starts up the stairs
paul has stopped half way up the stairs
he turns to kym beams at her
kymmie what can i make you
actually theres a meeting i have to make
and i have to pee in a cup
and register as a general biohazard
ill drive you
heading downstairs just tell me which car i should take
paul doesnt say anything
carol floats to pauls side
would you do me a favor kymmie
i have a license
you wouldnt believe my insurance
and im not
could we figure something else out
kym pedaling up on a bouncy high tech racing bike that is far too big for her
she bangs herself in the crotch as she dismounts
kym stops a baby faced nurse
im here to pee in a cup
over her shoulder she needs to pee in a cup
back to kym someone will be right with you
im trying to get to a meeting
the meetings are over in the other building
i know that
someone will be right with you
have a seat
several people are waiting in chairs
they look at kym
a different nurse is waiting by the sinks examining her teeth in the mirror
kym bangs open the door of her stall with her foot
the door swings back and kym spills her sample all over herself
as she runs up the outside staircase kym wipes at her shirt with a wet paper towel
she yanks open the door and a bird poops on her
narcotics anonymous meeting
an attractive guy is sharing
kym slams in frazzled and late
a few people look at her as she grabs a folding chair from a stack leaning against the wall and the other chairs slide to the floor with a huge
i was really broke
the room breaks up
kym struggles to rearrange the fallen chairs
she is pissed
that was tuesday
pastor mel a guest speaker shares details of his struggles inside the step process
kym like everyone present is riveted
sweaty and fed up with carols bike kym cycles into the buchman driveway
paul has been watching for her out the kitchen window while doing dishes
he waves and yells to his wife
carol shes here
where did you think i was
i made you a sandwich sweetheart
kyms shoulders slump
watching from an upstairs window rachel observes kym wheel the bike up the driveway and paul hurrying from the kitchen to meet her carrying a meat loaf sandwich and a
glass of milk
there is an awkward exchange of items
paul hugs and mushes kym and kisses her on the forehead
rachel opens the window calls down
fiancee sidney sexy compact thirties and best man kieran are stringing lights all over the house and yard
kieran is on a ladder
he is the same attractive guy from the meeting
sidney is completely wrapped chest to knees in twinkly white lights and he unspools himself as needed
rachel arrives with kym who is holding the aircraft carrier sized meatloaf sandwich thats oozing lettuce and ketchup and the enormous glass of milk
she holds them both like theyre suspended in formaldehyde
emma is working on her tan
you guys are not getting my design concept
rachel contd i want every single light to represent a different one night stand during the misspent youth of kris kringle before he stopped whoring around and became santa claus
i thought you said satan claus
i thought she said panty hose
or panda claws
pandas are endangered
were having an endangered panda fleeing for its life for the ice sculpture
or impaling itself on some bamboo
this is sidney williams my betrothed
sidney meet my sister kym
oh my god
to rachel sorry i called him a dawg
you dont look like a record producer
youre supposed to have a hapless lackey next to you with an umbrella
usually i do but moms out simonizing my car
funny you dont look like lucifers cupbearer
fingering a lock of hair i got a haircut
kym gives emma a look
emma smiles sweetly
rachel gestures up the ladder
and this is best man kieran
kym looks up the ladder at kieran
kym and kieran having sex in the cavernous basement
it runs practically the length of the house and there are nooks and caves everywhere
an ancient sofa riddled with cigarette burns some futons dragged down and thrown haphazardly in corners unicorn posters hideously and pornographically defaced and squat jars of ancient household products oil
of olay self tanner filled with cigarette butts offer proof of years of inhabitation
later kym lights up
well that was so wrong gee thanks
no believe me that was so lovely lovely
but in the program as you know and we just heard earlier today in fact it is kind of lurid isnt it
the best man and the maid of honor
furtively slipping off to the coal bin to have it off while the rest of the wedding party labors away at preparations for the big event
isnt emma going to be playing that role
maid of honor
i think i heard that was the plan
a lavish bollywood soundtrack plays as emma wraps kym in lilac fabric for her sari esque bridesmaids dress
kym examines herself in the mirrors of the private salon
the girls look like jewels against the lush fabrics pillows and curtains
rachel sits at a vanity trying on dangling earrings and shakes her head gently the gems glimmer and sparkle
isnt the lilac fabulous
you look like a freesia
to rachel i love the grey
were all wearing lilac
heedless grabbing the grey fabric look at this
i love this
its like a cloud
emma looks at rachel
you guys know how i am
i never wear lilac
its good to have a principle
kym ignores her
you wore a lilac sweater with a cat face on it on the cover of seventeen magazine when i was at fat camp
sure but i got paid for that and i was on horse tranquilizers
so why arent i the maid of honor
why is emma the maid of honor
what does that mean
i wasnt entirely sure when you were coming or even if youd make it
kym looks sharply at her
i wasnt sure if youd have time for a fitting
its a sari
you take a bolt of cloth and wrap it around you
jesus christ ive been home one day and i cant get a straight answer out of anybody
what are you talking about
im talking about dad offering me food every ten seconds
dad offers irish hunger strikers food every ten seconds
he has to know where i am and what im doing all the time because he has never resolved his own trust issues
oh leave dad alone
id love to but he wont let me
i feel him watching me all the time
and carol and you guys too
i know i have nothing better to think about
everybodys looking at me like im the visiting sociopath
what are you people waiting for me to do
burn the house down
they both look at her
that was a mattress fire and it wasnt even at home
it was on a sleep over
i should just get hazmat tattooed on my forehead for you people
youre like a harpy
is being my maid of honor this important to you
i didnt think you gave a shit
how could you fucking say that to me
emma would you be horribly offended and hurt if i asked you to step down as
exaggerated practically with quote fingers maid of honor
now emmas got another reason to hate me
like she needed one
is it what you want
for an instant conflict and pain flicker over rachels sweet face
the crown is yours first runner up
thank you emma
no thank you
its not about you
its about sisterhood
hooray for sisterhood
sisterhood conquers all
and bludgeons all and pillages all and leaves all for dead
returning to mirror so the gray is not an option
the rehearsal dinner the rehearsal component is in full swing amidst elegant dioramas and displays of ukrainian folk art saints traditional costumes a skillion painted eggs the mounted heads of
indigenous ukrainian animals and the plaster busts of ukrainian popes
the audience of revelers is clustered at one end of the room with drinks and appetizers while at the other end various friends take their shot at a brief rehearsal
old friend norman sklear is emceeing the line up he is currently at the mike with a funny improv based on really disastrous weddings he has known
everybody is laughing
paul carol a few of pauls closest record biz friends including a cult luminary or two mr

harrisons toast to paul his beautiful family and the memory of many memorable nights of music in the buchman house while the kids were growing up draws huge applause powering
the dinner the forty odd guests are now seated in an adjoining room at long tables laden with a gorgeous indian feast
yellow rice red curry vivid green and orange vegetable dishes pink shrimp
huge plates of dosa and brinjal
candles flicker in lanterns shaped like lotuses
photogenically stylish young servers dressed elegantly in black and white hover around the family and friends as everybody makes total pigs of themselves
the indian feast contrasts agreeably with the ukrainian visuals
evocative bollywood music provides the soundtrack
kym wandering on along the table like a nomad wedges herself between sidney and rachel
emma grabs an empty wine glass before kym knocks it over
i dont know anybody at whats obviously the loser end of the table
can i have your chana masala
without waiting for a response kym dives in with her naan
youve known most of those people since the eighth grade
you always pretend you dont know people
is it because you owe them money
wheres our mother
how could she not be here already
i havent even seen her since ive been home
she called a few times
shes running a little late but should be here soon
stuffing naan in her mouth she tries to catch a piece of fish tikka in her mouth and misses
kieran would you like some more saag paneer
is there any krill
i cant believe mom would be late for my release back into the wild
and here i was thinking tonight was about rachel
rach i forgot to tell you carol got the helium tanks
the words carol and helium somehow
arent there some rules about helium tanks
snorting she wouldnt have any idea what to do with a helium tank
only on public property
youre a lawyer
for about five minutes
say something legal
so what do you do now
i help sidney out with the business side of his stuff
the girls clamber up
kym brushes curry off rachels shirt
abby the girls mom and andrew her husband enter the dining room
abby is a beautiful wise woman in her fifties
elegant ladylike and graceful
andrew looks foxy in his abby selected armani but he has the shoulders and knuckles of a heavyweight
as the girls approach abby acknowledges paul across the room but makes no move to go beyond an exchange of long distance little waves and tight smiles
to rachel embracing hello darling
a big hug
she turns to kym
did you get my note
abby steps back but keeps her hands on kyms shoulders
you look beautiful
rehab makes you fat
you look great
he kisses kym on the cheek
rachel gives him a big hug
mom where have you been
is everything okay
we were wondering if you got the dates scrambled
abby steps towards her daughters taking them in
yes everything is absolutely fine now
what a relief
now the party can really get started
abby and rachel look quickly at kym
lighting a cigarette so mom you look great
darling can you smoke that in here
its a private party mom
still surly and irascible
oh you know how she is
she sends her love
kym drags on her cigarette like its the last coca cola in the desert
honey you should really put that out
its not right
you know that
kieran is making a toast
dinner is mostly over
waiters are discreetly clearing plates etc
from the table pouring more drinks
something like ive known sidney most of my life
he personifies many of lifes grandest cliches even as he breathes fresh life into most of them
he has never ever ceased to amaze me and only in the best of ways
the magnitude of his artistry and his business acumen are matters of public record and delight
hes been a great friend through thick and thin and sometimes its gotten very very thin but he stood by me at all times so it is my privilege and
honor to stand by him on this profound occasion
time cut emma rises and bangs her glass with her spoon
youre paying for that emma
id like to make a toast to the happy couple because i want to come visit them in hawaii
emma contd sidney whats the name of that place again
humuu humuu nukku nukuu
a pu aa aa
sidney kisses kieran on the cheek
sharply to her sister youre moving to hawaii
sidneys recording studio is there
kym stung exhales a plume of smoke
ive known the bride her entire life
not biblically except for that one time we french kissed at evan yasskys party in the ninth grade
i want film
whoops and hollers
commence embarrassing story
that wasnt it
rach do you remember the time i was teaching you to drive in the wagoneer and you sideswiped that taxi driver and knocked off his side mirror
i have no memory of that whatsoever
do you remember trying to outrun him and leading him on a high speed chase across th street
gotta say no
well i would like to share with everyone that miss rachel before she got her license or even had any idea how to drive out maneuvered an irate screaming cab
driver across th street to the east river handily avoiding two emt guys loading an old lady on a gurney while at the same time applying cocofudge lip gloss in the rearview mirror
bravos all around
she actually got the number of one of the e
t guys and went out with him
loudly was that the guy with the peroxide hair
abby not looking at her daughter shushes her
anyway when the taxi driver finally caught up with us rachel talked him down from his middle eastern fury in pretend farsi and ended up using his radio thing to
call his dispatcher and recommend this guy for a commendation
such a nice man
we were driving so fast
it was one of the more exhilarating moments in my life
but i knew that miss rachel would make it okay
so heres to you my dear dear friend
a woman who can drive fast pick up a paramedic make up languages and get you home in one piece
sidney you are a lucky bastard
abby smiles broadly at rachel and blows her a kiss
kym rises with her glass and takes emmas place on stage
she glows in the candlelight
for the crowd relax its seltzer
im shiva the destroyer and your harbinger of doom for the evening
i want to thank you all for coming and welcome you even though i havent seen most of you since my latest stretch in the big house
scattered low giggles
you all look fabulous
during the twenty minutes i was not in the hole for making a shiv out of my toothbrush i actually did participate in the infamous step program
step ball change step ball change
im still waiting for the change part
some guests laugh
carol paul rachel and abby sit silently
andrew moves in towards his wife
but as they say relapse is an almost always inevitable component of recovery god knows ive got high marks in that mode
everyone is staring at kym
anyhoo as more of you know than are likely to admit one of the actual steps is about making amends
so i spent a lot of time calling up people who barely remembered me who barely remembered anything and apologizing to them for bouncing a check or passing out in
the bathtub and flooding their house or otherwise involving them in sordid activities they were desperately trying to forget
i had to call this one girl who was i think fourteen but i couldnt talk to her because her mom took out a restraining order
kym thinks this is hysterical
paul does not
anyway i did a lot of apologizing to people who were practically strangers so i very much want to take this opportunity to not only congratulate my extraordinary sister the
future explorer in matters of the mind thank you very much and her adorable impending husband on the occasion of their unprecedented nuptials
but also to apologize to my extraordinary sister the future explorer in matters of the mind for
and i really mean that rachel
ive been a nightmare and youve been a saint
im so damned glad im here with you and sidney and his family and ours and i am so happy for you guys i really am
so i am hereby raising my seltzer in celebration of my laudatory sister and herewith making amends
sidney you are robbing our dysfunctional family of one of its most vital ingredients and its only member still willing to lend me money
she pauses for a second enjoy hawaii
she lifts her glass and downs its contents
there is a smattering of applause
to the group one down
whats for dessert
kieran stares sympathetically at kym
kym drops into a chair in the dining room as paul carol rachel sidney kieran and emma struggle in with several elaborately wrapped wedding gifts and leftovers from the rehearsal
dinner which they pile on the dining room table
rachel and sidney are having a quiet tense exchange
to anyone examining her split ends im exhausted
is there any watermelon
let me see
to kym as if shes joking nice apology
again making a joke out of it nice apology
i was toasting you and i was making amends
its one of the steps
i know what the steps are
rachel glides to the den and drags out the huge dictionary
i learned them in school and ive visited you in various facilities kym
sidney and emma share a look
rachel drops the dictionary on the dining room table
kym looks to her father
carol returns with a tray and a huge watermelon thats been impaled with an enormous kitchen knife
often followed by for
offset a disability or frustration by development in another direction
rachel blinks at her sister
youve never said anything to me thats remotely apologetic
yet all of a sudden at my wedding dinner in front of everybody you decide to grace us all with your development
i just got here
carol hands kym a slice of watermelon
just in case you might be thinking about something else for five minutes like i dont know my sisters wedding they just cut me loose
rachel contd im a loose cannon is that hysterical
anyone for some rehab humor
because im really fine with acknowledging my disease
and now watch me be really selfless and weave a lovely blanket apology to my sister for being a tad out of her loop
sidney and kieran staying out of this exchange a glance
chewing youre so cynical
dad since when has she been this cynical
shes making an effort rachel
thats what it was
because i think she presumes that since everything has always revolved around her disease everything else is going to revolve around her recovery
thats what i think
she just got home
i had no idea you were so angry doctor
kymmie your sisters got a lot on her plate
shes uptight about
im not uptight dad
shes meeting sidneys folks for the first time theres menus theres all that live music youre home theres a thousand things to worry about
absolutely a wedding will take it right out of you boy
yeah it would be so lovely if we could all just
removing seeds you people need to purge
you people really should go to nar anon or something
i mean it
oh my lord
kym we have gone through nar anon baby
you know that
turning her head you people
you mean the people in this room
all of you people living in this little world of judgement and paranoia and mistrust
i can feel it every second
at the slightest sign of ingratitude or absence of atonement its like the freaking salem witch trials around here
i might as well be
pouncing dont even start
standing next to her husband nobody can make you feel any way unless you let them kym
thank you carol for your inevitable pearl of wisdom but you people are my family
you people make me feel like shit a hundred times a day
you try living under dads constant monitoring for five minutes and see how you like it
what constant monitoring
ill drive you
carol shes back
dont sleep here sleep there
dad youre obsessed
thats hardly news
you may not know this
sure you do
the only way to engage dad in any meaningful communication is to start the conversation with your name
have you heard from kym
it resuscitates him
it jars him into the moment
like an alarm
thats unfair rachel
and completely untrue
and shes even worse
dad youre never going to believe this but i lost the car again
dad youre never going to believe this but that check you sent me never showed up and my landlord hates me
dad can somebody meet me downstairs with cab fare and youre never going to believe this but i need to go to the emergency room and my neighbors suing me
and my checkbook got stolen
gee rach sounds like you have some paternal sibling issues to work through
are you kidding
the two of you are like a double helix of crises
in the language of psychology one could say you both suffer from acute boundary issues
its nice that youre getting your ph
d she throws up her hands
oh god but dont be patronizing
it doesnt become you
how come she gets to spout off about paternal issues but god forbid i should even reference the boundary thing even though i actually know what im talking about
waving her arms hello
by the way
im not in crisis
i havent been in crisis for a year
you just got out of rehab
why is this so difficult for you people to understand
its like youre not happy unless im in some kind of desperate situation
you have no idea what to do with me unless im desperate
why am i the only one whos willing to say this stuff
oh poor you
youre so much more evolved in your suffering
you know what
your suffering is not the most important thing in the world to everybody
rachel contd there are billions and billions and billions of people in nations all over the world who never even think about you
other people have lives
we have lives
i have a life
im in school
im getting married
rachel just stands there not saying anything
everyone stares at rachel
rachel looks at sidney
sidney passes the look right back to her
beat then huge whoops and hollers
oh my god
paul hugs rachel and kisses her hair
sidney and kieran hug
emma hugs rachel and kisses sidney
hugging all around
kym is pissed
paul grabs kym and rachel and hugs both daughters at once
rachel and kyms faces are mushed right next to each other
kym is impatient and stiff in the dreaded double mush
kym breaks from pauls vice like grip
that is so unfair
ecstatic when did you find out
roughly about the day before we decided to get married
i can barely believe it myself
laughing mushing rachels belly
paul contd how long
how much pregnant
did you tell your mother
we told her at dinner
she was so happy wait
you cant just drop that tectonic bit of information into a completely separate conversation rachel
you cant do that
kym youre going to have a niece
or a nephew
of course im happy for you
but you cant tell me when were talking like this
its a total set up
all the energy drains out of rachel
i am so fucking exhausted
dad will you tell her im happy for her
i need to go to bed
im beat too
to rachel youre leaving
in the middle of this conversation
kymmie shes pregnant
im off to raid the medicine cabinet
kym is gone
shes not serious
everyone gathers around rachel
oh rachel darling and sidney i couldnt be happier
she wasnt serious was she

he mushes her face and kisses her cheek
then he mushes carols face
what a day
i think ive aged
i mean it
to paul would you mind if i went to bed darling
kissing her again of course not
ill be up carol
im just going to load the dishwasher
sidney intones the opening bars to pauls heroic dishwasher theme
paul raises the cautionary finger in sidneys direction
sidney stops with the music
let me help itll be quicker
now the cautionary finger is levelled at carol
dont mess with the king
hands in the air carol leaves the room
thats it for me too you guys
good night everybody
kieran lays a manly buddy hug on sidney
thanks my friend

paul is beaming like a klieg light
ive never been so tired in my life
paul gives rachel a kiss on the cheek and mushes her face some more
i hope its okay i told mom at dinner
about the baby
of course lamb chop

im going to be a grandpa
sidney mushes paul and they attempt a hug and laugh and then they really hug
i wish ethan were here
i know sweetheart
that went well
kieran and kym lie entangled in the basement sharing a cigarette disheveled
the floor of this entire section of the basement is now covered with all of the carefully arranged mattresses and futons that were stacked down here before
all of kyms mismatched bags have been moved down here too
theres a little lamp there now as well but its not on
only one of the small cobwebby windows casts a dappled light onto the scene
that was such a set up
she probably didnt realize she was doing it
shes such an operator
now im the bad guy again
theyre lucky to have you
otherwise theyd have to pay attention to their own suspicious lives
nobody actually wants me to actually change you know
what would they obsess about
im like a blessing
laughing no argument from me
dad had an actual blueprint for rehabilitative success at my last intervention
on graph paper
he goes all out with the response my dad
not unlike this great nation in which we live
meanwhile an ex heterosexual ex boy friend of mine actually rang the door once and tells my mother kym is sitting in her apartment
with the shades drawn
doing all this heroin and cocaine
and i think shes going to like die
and mom smiles and says thank you like he was speaking in sanskrit
you cant actually speak in sanskrit
i nodded out into the poached salmon at dads wedding two years ago and he told carol he thought it was jet lag
i did that in soup once
it made such a mess
a giant delivery truck drives slowly up the driveway delivering the tent for tomorrows wedding party
kym leads kieran through the labyrinthine rooms of the basement giving kieran a guided tour of the subterranean world of which she was the ruler and where ethan was her
loyal companion the secret hide and seek rooms the mattress room the scary little side rooms etc
a very stylish very elegant very modern in the best sense home lots of grounds lots of foliage
rachel and abby are seated on abbys bed looking through some family heirlooms in an old alligator jewel case
rachel is holding an ornate satin evening purse
look how exquisite this is
i cant borrow this
what do you carry in here
a vital organ
a tiny spleen
isnt it divine
it was grandmas
she sends her love
i love the color
you must promise me youll stay healthy now rachel
youll eat properly and get a lot of rest
how are things going at the house
and his friend
whats his name
he seems to be a big hit
is your sister behaving herself
im not exactly sure what that means
well she needs a lot of acknowledgement
it cant be easy
everybody knowing her troubles
mom shes sold syndication rights to her troubles
mom does it bother you at all carol doing so much wedding stuff
not at all darling im thrilled to be providing the flowers
you know how much that means to me
theyre going to be exquisite
yes im sure and thats so great and so you but you can do whatever else you want you know
id love it
thank you my sweetheart
i just know id be one of those wedding mothers who goes completely insane about the hors doeuvres
andrew says i shouldnt be allowed near a shrimp puff
there are so many other people for you to worry about
abby contd your sisters home and everybodys there and the bride always ends up keeping everybody else satisfied
but this is going to be the most beautiful wedding ever
and i hope your sister has a wonderful time too
anyway im going to be a grandmother
im so excited
i have always wanted to be a grandmother
even when i was thirty
this ring was grandmas and she wanted you to have it
is she dead
i hope its a boy
as long as its healthy
try the ring on
youve always had the most beautiful hands
a neighborhood place but on the other side of the parkway from the buchmans neighborhood
friendly bustling kids on bikes and skateboards etc
large windows offer a view of a stop sign fannys beauty salon soul to soul liquor a barber shop etc
the restaurant is fluorescently lit with a jamaican flag on the wall and photos of muhammad ali malcolm x and bob marley
there is a counter at the front where you place your order and pick up your food
there is a foosball table and a pinball machine
kym and kieran are playing foosball at the ancient table where someone has painted jamaican jerseys on all the players
they are both viciously competitive and genuinely irritated with each other
your hand is on the turf
so we have to do it over now
it was your shot and you get to do it over
what are you talking about
dont tell me you didnt know having one hand on the turf makes the play null
maybe we should just play pinball
the metal balls ricocheting around the interior of the machine
sometimes playing next to each other is easier than playing together
who told you that
she runs a pre school
they both crack up
whats hawaii like
youve never been
ive got a nice place
my horse lives there
most people say my girlfriend lives there or my wife lives there
i live there and so does my horse
hes very possessive
were working through it
have you had him a long time
i may be a degenerate dope fiend but i love my horse
i dont have a wife or a girlfriend and ive been clean almost seven years
you could just ask you know
your sister doesnt ask direct questions either
shes incredibly cryptic
thats a shrink thing not a genetic thing
kym is sharing at todays step meeting
kieran the others listen intently
we were in the park
i was sixteen and i was
i had taken all these percoset
i was unbelievably high
kym contd he had thrown away his shoes and i was like moms going to kill me because i had no idea where his shoes were but he was so
happy about it
and he had his red socks and he was running around kicking up the leaves
you know in movies where they show a persons high or whatever and the camera careens all around
it was like that
we were having so much fun
we were leaping around in huge piles of leaves
he buried me
i buried him in a big pile
i was on baby sitting detail
he was pretending he was a train
so he was charging through the leaf pile making tracks you know
i was the caboose
and he kept going coal caboose
so its time to go and were driving home and hes in his car seat still demanding coal and i couldnt focus and i drove off the bridge
the car went into the lake
i couldnt get him out of his car seat
paul rachel emma sidney and norman sklear are sprawled on the porch eating sandwiches and figuring out the seating arrangement for the wedding by manipulating tiny origami chickens a tiny
turtle monopoly pieces spools of thread etc
each with a small name tag
paul sees kierans rental pull up grins and calls to carol
carol theyre back
carol emerges with a tray of lemonade as the rental is rolling to a stop
kieran and kym are climbing out of the car
shouting from the porch are you hungry
i made a salad nicoise
its got tuna
shouting back i was just thinking salad nicoise
can we get back to what we were doing please
where were we
can you please put the rosenzwiegs somewhere far away from me
paul sits heavily
theyre your friends dad
theyre not my friends
ive just known them my entire life
just so you know my mother expects to be carried in by liveried servants to the triumphant swirls of the harp and seated on a solid gold throne forged by
because right now i have her shoveling kelp in the laundry room
but i have it as a montage
kieran and kym arrive on the porch
kym settles herself on a big comfy chaise
where are you putting me
in the stockade
kym stop it
youre at the family table
kym turns her face to the sun shutting her eyes
heedless dont put me with michael and sandy
theyre not invited
sandy never called me back after i sent her an amends e mail from milestones
i hate it when people dont meet you half way
the family table
paul moves kyms marker the monopoly dog to the family table
i thought you were having tables of eight
pointedly i am
to anyone her eyes still closed where are you putting me
i was thinking of putting you with cookie puss and the chicago cousins because they always get really drunk and need wrangling
can someone else do it
i was planning on enjoying myself
youre the only one theyre afraid of
rachel pushes the monopoly dog to a different table
not getting it we can move grandma rose and her companion
thats actually a great idea
kym opens one eye and sees paul switch markers the monopoly dog is back at the family table
rachel stares at her father
thats all i need
another reason for grandma rose to hate me
she doesnt hate you
shes still mad about that thing at the rite aid
rachel moves the monopoly dog to another table
paul looks at her
dad can i show you something in the kitchen
paul and rachel alone
sotto rachel what is this behavior
same i would just like to have a day please
have all the days you want
nobody is taking your day
then why are you defending her
defending her from what
darling look no ones defending any body
why are you protecting her
i dont want her to feel like we dont want her
sometimes i dont want her
its my fucking wedding dont you get it
i want my table to be perfect
paul kisses her on the forehead
shes your sister
they look at each other
the screen door swings open as emma carol sidney kieran and norman sklear carry the lunch plates to the kitchen
kym follows carrying the salt shaker
im going to load the dishwasher
paul listen ive been thinking about it
i did some preliminary sketches id love to show them to you
to carol hes not kidding
and i think if you move the salad bowls to the upper tier you can get about more stuff in the dishwasher
hee hee hee
paul gives him a look
sidney starts humming pauls sidney youre a nice young man
you make a lot of money and the world is your oyster
but you dont know shit about loading a dishwasher
sir with all due respect the mantle has passed
paul takes a moment to size sidney up then spins on his heel to the dishwasher
sidney has his sleeves up and starts to load
whats the time limit
are you comfortable with that sir
i could spot you thirty seconds
you young people should all go fuck yourselves
you see paul i think your problem lies in lid placement
sidney contd inverting the lids and stacking them in the upper level is really for amateurs
rachel youre out of the will
with a flourish sidney presents a beautifully stacked dishwasher
paul pats his shoulder somberly
clean out this machine please boy
so i can break out the whup ass
screaming all around
kym jumps up and down with her arms on rachels shoulders
rachel glances at her sister laughing
delightedly hes breakin out the whup ass
paul is loading the dishwasher like a champ
carol and emma are smiling and giggling
kieran has his eye on the clock
sidney trash talks from the sidelines
you know one of the early signs of senile dementia is an obsessive need to organize
rachel go fetch me my dart gun
i find it touching but ultimately sad when the warriors of yesteryear are reluctant to lay down their plastic containers from zabars and retire gracefully
kieran hows my time
you have twenty five seconds
i need more dishes
somebody give me some dishes
kym yanks open a cupboard and passes a handful of dishes to paul
he begins to load them
he has a bowl in his hands
we see the bowl is a plastic childs bowl with engines and cabooses all over it
paul turns the bowl around in his hands like a steering wheel
it dawns on kym that shes handed her father ethans bowl
she is stricken
paul looks to carol
he seems bewildered
the kitchen falls silent and carol takes ethans bowl and places it in the sink out of sight
she leads paul gently out of the kitchen
she turns and leaves the kitchen
sidney follows her
emma and norman sklear step out onto the porch
kieran takes the ethan bowl from the sink and puts it quietly back in the cupboard and shuts the door
kym doesnt know what to do
the station wagon heading away from the buchman house
rachel is driving kym is in the passenger seat
the radio is on and neither says anything
kym cranks down the window tries to light a cigarette
mom is handling the flowers
well shes growing them and choosing them but they are being delivered by her people
nurturing and growing things from the soil
can we talk about the candles for a minute
because yeah exactly
candles and rice paper all lit up during the ceremony
its a way of honoring ethan ethans
spirit you know
it will look really nice too mainly
millions of little candles all over the place and one huge rice paper candle representing ethan glowing near the couple
that would be you and sidney
oh my god no
that would kill dad
please kym please please please dont do that
it was an idea
lighten up okay
they do that in japan or india or someplace okay
just drop it sweetie okay
oh my god fine
it was nothing okay
it was just an idea
kym contd just a stupid idea
i was joking you jerk
lighten up rachel
this is your big weekend
establishing this busy connecticut city as the station wagon drives behind a fancy hair salon on the main drag
kym and rachel have foils in their hair situated a few chairs apart
rachel is intently working on a crossword puzzle
are you getting a manicure
rachel silently waggles her fingers
kym glances back at her magazine to discover one of the stylists standing close by gazing at her face
kym does a little double take
you dont remember me do you
kym looks sharply at the stylist noting his sincere face the warmth of his eyes
rick james limousine
rachel nearby grimaces
i meant to come back
i even had
oh god what was it
peanut m ms and carbona cleaning fluid
god is punishing me
no hes blessing me
its cool i talked him down
uncomfortable so how are ya
you remember we were in the hospital together right
i didnt go to milestones
i didnt have the coverage
we were on the same floor at loeb house
that was before you went to milestones
where did you go after that
my parents house
its all about the coverage right
he stares deeply movingly into kyms eyes
i cant believe im seeing you again
more uncomfortable i know
its so weird
do you remember that exercise where we all had to write down experiences and pass them anonymously to another person
the human mirror seeing with a fresh perspective like secret santas of despair
i got yours
kym gives him a quizzical look
you drew poodles in the margins
i know its supposed to be anonymous and everything but you were so brave
the way your uncle abused you and your sister and how it led to your sisters anorexia and how you stayed up nights when she was down to fifty pounds
holding a mirror to her face to make sure she was breathing
ill never forget reading that i swear to god
rachels stylist is removing her foils while rachel chokes on her diet pepsi and it comes out her nose
kym looks nervous
to rachel do you want a tissue
rachel looks horrified holding her hand over her nose
to kym i found it so profoundly inspirational that you could be there for her during your own incredible ordeal
i thank god that you came in here today
i never thought id ever have the chance to thank you
it was your strength that gave me the courage to confront my own abuse and help me turn my life around
rachel slams down her magazine and leaves the salon
kym runs after her
both girls have foils in their hair
rachel is being trailed by her sister through the parking lot
would you stop
rachel doesnt stop
she is searching for her keys in the fading daylight
kym catches up takes rachels arm
dont touch me
dont you think his perspective might be a little skewed
i never had anorexia
you sure as hell didnt watch over me while i was sleeping and we dont have a interrupting that we know of
shit in one fell swoop
did you tell them that dad forced us into a life of prostitution while you were at it
she stops and tries to remember wait
rachel yanks open the car door jumps in
i wasnt hurting anybody
no one got hurt rach
rachel slams the car door shut
rachel drives off with a screech leaving her sister standing there
rachel yanking the foils out of her hair perches on the sofa next to carol and paul
she is furious
i hate her
you dont hate her
dont tell me what i dont hate
i hate hate the lies
she lied in rehab
what do you mean she lied
she lied to the people who were working with her
who were trying to help her
she lies to everybody
not getting it where is she now
where am i now dad
kym comes stomping in
her foils are still intact
thanks for abandoning me
i had to take a taxi
disbelieving are you kidding me
why would anything i said or didnt say at the hospital hurt you
it wasnt about you
why wasnt it about me
to kym why not
i was hopeful
i was on your side
i still am
do you have any idea what that means
do you have any idea how lonely it was with everybody gone into your terrible world
there was nothing left
everybody was just empty
you think they remembered i was alive or needed anything during your
and after all that loneliness and mom and dad blaming each other and worrying and death and divorce and that stupid hopefulness and dad not even being able to listen
to music you were in the hospital lying about us
instead of telling the truth about yourself
wait a minute
wait a minute
whats this all about
apparently she has a whole history of sexual molestation
kym what is your sister saying
did you say you were sexually molested
oh jesus christ
not by you
it was a long time ago
why in gods name would you say something like that
it was anonymous
it seemed like a good idea at the time
the three on the couch are stunned for a moment
dad look at me
im right here
im telling you that after ethan died i wanted her to get better or just die
she is better
to paul and dad she was lying and she didnt give a shit about the rest of us
recovery cant work if you lie
she knows that
i was worthless to her
we all meant nothing to her
youre not worthless
youre my sister
i love you guys
i need you guys but you dont get to sit around for the rest of my life deciding what im supposed to be like
you werent there
you werent inside my head when i was fucked up and your certainly not there now
you havent got a clue what i feel
kym you took ethan for granted
you were high for his life
you were not present for his life
you were high
he was like a pet to you
you drove him off the bridge
and now hes dead
it was an accident
i was stoned out of my mind
jesus christ who do i have to be now
did i use up all the love im allowed for this lifetime because i killed our little brother
no it was an accident
im sorry okay
paul bursts out weeping
it was an accident
kym her hair still in foils rushes out of the house
carol turns to rachel
rachel bolts upstairs
carol turns to paul
paul waves her away
carol is bawling too
a state trooper sitting in his patrol car looks up from his coffee as pauls mercedes station wagon screeches into a nearby parking space
the cop watches kym get out of the car and stalk into the
steam rises from the surface of abbys high tech and sumptuous bathtub as she quickly turns the water off and speaks into her cell phone
he is alone and the door is shut hello abby
intercut the conversation hello paul
is kym with you
did she go somewhere
she left the house about an hour ago
to a meeting
she and rachel had an argument
the night before her wedding
what was it about
look abby it doesnt matter
she left the house
she took the car
what was the argument about
i dont know
they were both getting their hair done
you dont know
well what were they saying
for gods sake abby
im trying to figure out where she went before i call the police
well last time you called the police looking for her she was upstairs asleep in the guest room
she wasnt asleep she was unconscious
and im glad i called the police because it took twenty minutes to wake her up and at least something was being done
paul im trying to help
youre trying to dismiss everything
shes not a criminal
youre disregarding everything im saying and this failure to listen failure to understand what is right in front of you is exactly why you will never be able
to help her
maybe thats not what she needs all the time
stammering i mean
i mean maybe she needs us maybe she needs someone to be watchful and present and in her life
to trust her she could hurt herself
she could be lying dead in a ditch somewhere
paul tries to pull himself together
abby is trembling
if you hear anything can i count on you to please call me
incredulous can you count on me
abby puts her hand to her mouth
intercut with paul waiting then yes paul you can count on me to call if i hear anything
now abby waits then okay then
she hangs up
he hangs up
the room is piled high with boxes overflowing with tulle and flowers and glassware
carol sidney rachel kieran and emma are seated around the cheerless dining room table picking at the dinner in front of them
even emma appears to have given up
she is drinking a lot of wine
paul returns to the table
abby hasnt heard from her
rachel stabs her dessert with her fork
her head is on sidneys shoulder she looks pale and exhausted
she must feel awful
gently excuse me but when youre trying to get better theres a lot of pressure in rehabs
when someone isnt ready to take responsibility they create something like an uncle stan to take responsibility until theyre ready
hollow well shes always been creative
i just wish we knew where she was
paul would you like me to go out and look for her
rachel takes sidneys hand
youre getting married tomorrow
a hundred people will be here
any idea where she might have gone
everybody looks at kieran
no one responds
the phone rings
carol goes to get it
its the caterer
emma gives rachels arm a squeeze
ill take it
kieran looking drawn under the fluorescent lights stands inside the jamaican restaurant staring out at the night
through the window a beat up white honda tears ass right through the stop sign and screeches on up the road
abby is in her kitchen preparing tea dressed in loose fitting yoga style pjs hair still wet from her bath
a door opens behind her and kym emerges from the bathroom rubbing her hands over her face
you should call your father
the air seems to go out of kym for a moment
in a minute
i need a glass of water
ive made some tea
abby picks up the tray leading the way from the kitchen into the living room
trailing behind her kym looks around her mothers unfamiliar house the spaciousness and stark modernity of andrews house stand in marked contrast to the rampant folksy ness of the buchman
abby places the tea service on a low table in front of a sprawling sofa in the stone walled living room
you look upset
kym sits pours and sips
abby remains standing and tightens the belt of her bathrobe
when will andrew be back
not too late
hes at a dinner
i spoke to grandma today
she sends her love
is everything all right with the wedding
dad was loading the dishwasher
and i handed him ethans bowl with the trains on it by accident
kym begins to weep
abby remains still
kyms weeping becomes louder and louder
she is having trouble breathing
just as abby reaches out to touch her
why did you leave me in charge of him
all of you knew
people told you
i was a junkie
kym contd i was a crazy drug addict
i stole from you
i lied to your face
i weighed six pounds and my hair was falling out
i spent every dinner in the bathroom
you were sick
you know what i was
its not like there werent any clues
i stayed in my room for days
i passed out all the time
where were you mom
what were you thinking
why did you leave me
why did you leave me in charge of him
abby closes her fists and beats kym with all her strength
you werent supposed to kill him
you werent supposed to kill him
kym curls up protectively and abby suddenly stops
abby swings at kym again and connects
kym punches abby right back twice now she is on her feet
both women stop terrified and look at each other
kym moves toward her mother
keeping her back to the door she backs out of her mothers house
kym falls down the front steps
her nose is bleeding and her eye starts to swell
where are the car keys
here they are
where is the door handle
here it is
she drives off
kym driving the station wagon too fast
through the windshield headlights
its not raining
a curve in the road squealing around it
the road forks twenty yards ahead woods in between
left or right
kym drives straight ahead careening off the road smashing down a couple of saplings losing speed right fender smashing into a big rock airbags blast up into kyms face airbag
deflates kyms head falls forward bangs against the steering wheel
a tiny moan
the station wagon has come to a halt far off the road concealed by undergrowth and trees in the foreground
there is no movement in the car
a volvo station wagon drives by continuing on its way
paul kieran and sidney are seated around the family room
paul and sidney are drinking red wine kieran something else
an empty bottle is in front of them and sidney is uncorking a fresh one
i never thought id have two little girls
two little girls running around with their tummies sticking out in their diapers
they used to bite me on the nose the two of them
paul contd id hold both of them in the pool and theyd take turns biting my nose
ethan never did that
he preferred pinkies
sidney and kieran chuckle appreciatively
paul joins the laughter pours some more wine
rachel and emma are curled up in the middle of the bed spoon style with clothes still on
emma is behind rachel lost to the world gently snoring
rachels eyes are wide open
carol swings the door cautiously open and peers inside
rachel and carol look at each other for a long time
carol withdraws closing the door behind her
the station wagon seen just as before
a couple of joggers lope by on the road
kym jolts awake as a stamford policeman raps on her closed window
she is a mess
a black eye
a split bloody lip
a gash across her forehead
the cop is simultaneously gesturing for her to roll her window down and speaking into his radio
kym tries to start the car
the cop bangs on the window
kym leans her head against the steering wheel
the horn starts blowing
the joggers a couple of early dogwalkers and a couple of kids on bikes are gathered by the roadside whispering and watching
now the cop is studying kyms license and registration
now an ambulance has arrived
red lights flashing
the crowd of onlookers has swelled considerably
now the cop gives a clearly upset kym a breathalyzer test as paramedics wrap a pressure cuff around her arm she exhales into the breathalyzer tube her eyes darting between
the cop the cracked windshield of the car and the gawking crowd up on the road
time cut the paramedic holds kym firmly by the chin and peers deeply into her right eye
the other paramedic blots at kyms swollen lip with a gauze and hands her an ice pack
time cut the cop gives kym her license and hands her an official looking form which she stuffs in her shoulder bag
a truck towing the beat up station wagon comes to a halt in the street in front of the buchman house
kym steps down from the passenger seat ignoring whatever the driver just said in parting
the house is festooned with peonies and lights and workers hurrying about
everything looks absolutely beautiful
caterers are running from their vans into the house with armloads of food drinks etc
abbys flowers are being unloaded from another van
decorative chandeliers are being carried inside
valets are setting up their car parking operation a decorated picnic table at the foot of the driveway
kym squares her shoulders and begins her long walk up to the buchman house back into the chaos
a cute valet passes kym on the lawn carrying two paper cups of coffee dressed in an indian military tunic
he takes in kyms disheveled and bruised appearance
im the maid of honor
kym continues her walk toward the house
hey i know you
i used to work at the dog grooming place
kym keeps walking ignoring him
hey you holding
paul and carol beautifully dressed appear on the front porch and hurry towards kym
oh my lord
are you all right
they meet at the circular driveway
i hit mom
oh my god is she
not with the car
we need to get you to a hospital
i have to get dressed
look at you
you need to get to a hospital
he tries to touch her
she stops his hand
paul backs off
you cant just vanish
you cant just leave
you have to call
you always have to call
paul looks helplessly at his wife
why dont you go find your sister
she didnt sleep last night waiting for you
kym runs onto the porch as a group of gofers carry more of abbys flowers through the front door
emma is on the front porch filling balloons with helium assisted by the kids from next door
emma inhales from a balloon as she sees kym
in a helium voice oh
kieran is in the living room on his cell phone when he spots kym
behind him we see norman sklear matt and innbo removing the last of the living room furniture to the rear patio
into the phone she just showed up
to kym do you need a doctor
you sent out the cavalry
for your dad
mostly for your dad
i have to get ready
i have to get dressed
im so glad to see you
charging up the stairs
also known as the bridal chamber
kym yanks the door open and rachel jumps a mile
she is dressed in her sari and huge gold earrings and looks beautiful despite a lack of sleep
seeing her bashed up sister framed in the doorway rachel fights tears
i hit mom
with the car
you hit mom
you hit our mother
kym looks completely desperate
rachels face contorts with rage as she steps forward and slams the bedroom door in kyms face
rachel yanks the door open again
rachel has run a bath for her sister
she has removed her sari but not her earrings
kym is in the bath
her body is bruised and purple
rachel dabs gently at kyms face with a washcloth while kym scrubs at her nails with a brush
she glides the soapy washcloth over kyms back
she notices the word ethan inscribed within the design of the rose and thorns image tattooed on kyms left shoulder
rachel rinses shampoo and leaves and dirt out of her sisters hair while kym brushes her teeth
rachel dabs makeup on kyms chin as kyms hands tremble with the mascara
i got it
back in her wedding sari rachel wraps kym in her bridesmaids gown and puts some lilies of the valley in her hair
can you do this
the ceremony guests some standing some in white chairs
the living room is festooned with wall to wall flowers
a canopy of cherry blossoms leads from the living room terrace to the opened living room doors
sidney looking stunning in a dove grey nehru suit and a lavender pocket square waits at the altar with groomsmen kieran norman sklear and cousin joseph now wearing full dress
and officiating judge castle
sfx live music here comes the bride on distant electric guitar and drums plus foreground violin and gently chanted rachels and sidneys by the assembled friends
emmas smiling face fills the frame as the ceremony begins
bridesmaids emma kayra williams victoria and
kym in her dress with her striped hair split lip and black eye trying to find her game face
the wedding guests are slack jawed
williams sidneys mom looks like shes passing a stone
abby stands quietly with andrew in the first row
she looks composed and lovely and has the tiniest hint of a bruise on her chin
the procession reaches the altar and the wedding party turns to face rachel and paul
paul is beaming walking his beautiful daughter from the side of the house and across the terrace to the living room
she glows in her white and gold sari
they reach the altar of blossoms
rachel kisses her dads cheek and he hugs her
things are set up so that rachel and sidney stand just inside the living room facing the beautiful backyard
kym reaches for rachels bouquet but rachel has handed it to emma by reflex

rachel is crying
sidney takes his pocket square and carefully dries her tears
abby is drying her own eyes
rachel makes her own declaration to sidney
norman sklear hands sidney an acoustic guitar and sidney strums it and plucks a delicate melody
to rachels stomach and you

a small town never put her roots down daddy always kept movin so she did too
you know it aint easy you got to hold on she was an unknown legend in her time now shes dressin two kids lookin for a magic kiss she gets
the far away look in her eyes
somewhere on a desert highway she rides a harley davidson her long blonde hair flyin in the wind shes been runnin half her life the chrome and steel she rides
collidin with the very air she breathes the air she breathes
the air she breathes
the guests join in on the last chorus with spontaneous ad lib instrumentation from some of the musician friends
the song ends with a huge eruption of laughter and applause
on that note and with the power vested in me by the state of connecticut and neil young i now pronounce you husband and wife
lots of screaming and laughing
carol and mr
williams throw pink and white confetti hearts
kym applauds wildly and is crying her eyes out
paul weeps openly
carol breathes a sigh of relief
post ceremony lunch the whole wedding party inner circle everybody is enjoying barbecue oysters vegetarian supreme beers wine various other chill juices and snackettes on the back terrace around the
swimming pool and spread out at picnic tables and blankets across the expansive back lawn
the exotic reception party tent stands proudly and invitingly down the slope
the musician friends are playing their version of rachel loves sidney
some guests have removed as many layers of clothing as weather permits
some including sidney and rachel have even changed into bermudas and sweatshirts for the moment
rachel and sidney are serving second helpings to their friends

rachel suddenly stands on a chair and bangs on a glass with a spoon

abby smiles politely at kym and goes to sit down with andrew
kieran spirits kym to the patio where they join the dancers
the receiving line all members of both families are lined up outside the entrance to the tent to greet the inner circle gang and the lucky few outsiders who have
been invited to this evenings gala wedding reception party
it is twilight
everybody is spruced and rested
rachel and sidney have changed into awesome party outfits
inside the tent yet another group of musician friends are currently laying down an evocative hypnotic and extremely cool jazzy world music groove as the same attractive and immaculate young
servers from the rehearsal dinner circulate with trays of delicious appetizers wine seltzer etc
kym is still wearing her sari
she stands next to her mother
they are doing their wedding party duties
neither woman is looking at the other
to abby indicating kym and how is our little wayward girl
i had an accident
and how are you bob

angela sports an intense tattooed image on the inside of her right forearm
her face features a unique piercing
kym hugs her
their reunion makes her cry
angela is nice
the tent is fairly packed now with about some odd people
everybody is getting along fine
with a single dramatic gesture norman sklear silences the band
upon normans instructions the drummer works his cymbals in such a way that the party goers realize that something big is about to happen
norman sklear now gestures for complete silence and he gets it
rachel and emma grin madly at each other
louder approaching the tent entrance from the moonlit backyard
all eyes on the entrance the swimming pool lights shimmering outside as into the middle of the crowd
the musicians blow whistles and bang on drums
the cafe au lait beauties gyrate and pull guests out of their chairs
rachel leaps from her chair into sidneys arms and he gives her a huge sexy kiss as he rubs her tummy
wedding guests scream with delight and rush to the floor
the drummers become more impassioned with every beat
they travel allover the dance floor a trail of guests behind them
sweat is dripping the girls are glistening wet the guests are pulled into a massive pulsing heartbeat on the dance floor
emma kayra and victoria are dancing together screaming until cousin joseph matt and another male friend muscle their way in
little kids swing each other around in circles
rachel and sidney are practically doing it on the dance floor
a brazilian beauty shimmies over to them her headdress bobbing her smile enormous
sidney immediately puts his head on her bosom
after a beat rachel does too laughing
carol stands quietly besides paul and takes his hand and whispers to him
though not dancing they are clearly enjoying the carnival
paul gives a little shimmy
abby and andrew are huddled together at a table talking intensely
its like they are blind to the spectacle
kieran offers his hand to kym
she leaps up spilling her flowers
kieran pulls her to the middle of the crowd
they circle each other
they come together almost violently and dance like theres no tomorrow
kyms head is thrown back
shoulders heaving kieran swings her around by the waist
emma shimmies wildly with her partner her hair a mess
williams clapping wildly and doing the limbo hustle drunken parent dance
guests stomping and cheering
the brown glittering dancers are shaking thisclose to the drummers who have their shirts off
a dancer rocks with an older gentleman who gulps oxygen from a tank
rachel and sidney are bathed in sweat kissing
sidney is gulping champagne
kieran and kym have their foreheads together and their eyes closed chests heaving
carol and paul watching laughing
andrew whispering in abbys ear
she just stares off
kieran and kym glued together
rachel tossing her hair wildly sidney behind her
everyone laughing laughing dancing
the exotic tent looks beautiful out there in the sprawling backyard reflections of the pool lights shimmering off its sides
the whole backyard is enchanted with magically deployed twinkle lights japanese lanterns and other special lighting effects adding to the aura
rachel loves sidney is being played in a mellow super romantic trumpet solo mode now by christian scott
an assorted bunch of guests have relocated to the poolside patio in their finery
the oxygen guy and his matronly wife are seated on a transplanted living room couch talking intently to a be feathered headdressed dancer
norman sklear and emma are sharing a stylish quietly triumphant slow dance whispering punctuated by gusts of laughter
angela paylin is out there too
little kids are running around the lawn and a few are playing with olive the dog
kym kneels at the far corner of the swimming pool unnoticed by anyone
a wooden serving tray floats on the surface of the water supporting a candle wrapped in rice paper
a couple of smaller candles surround the slightly larger one
kym lights the candles extinguishes the match gently slides the illuminated tray out towards the center of the pool watches
kym rises and walks towards the house looking for something
to kym i can do a handstand
she executes a truly terrible handstand
the girl throws a rebellious dance move in kyms direction
the girl laughs and runs off
kym crosses the back terrace and enters the living room through the flower bedecked canopy
where she finds rachel and sidney slow dancing alone and dreamy in the center of the darkened room the walls still covered with the ceremonial flowers
a single candle flickers nearby
the dancers are oblivious to kyms presence
to rachel hi
rachel has her head on sidneys shoulder her eyes closed
taking a break
how can you take a break from your own daughters wedding
mom doesnt actually participate in things
and anyway she hasnt even done anything all day
i was thinking about getting her a cat
cats are really annoying
at some point you have to deal with them right
or they starve to death and piss on your sheets
its so nice here
suddenly kieran sweeps into the room
you can run but you cant hide
kym shrieks as kieran grabs her and plants a wet one on her dipping her to the floor
they careen into sidney and rachel
sidney grabs rachel and starts molesting her
totally into it stop
stop you fiend
rachel and sidney fall to the floor writhing sounding way too amorous
the ceiling light flicks on overhead and abby enters the living room
blinking against the light rachel struggles to her feet smoothing her dress
here you are
from the floor hello abby
and im not looking up your skirt
kieran is busting a gut not to laugh
ive been looking for you all over the place
where are you
im in here
andrew pops his head in
theyre bringing the car around
darling im exhausted
i had such a marvelous time
those dancers were so beautiful
but weddings are really for young people
abby contd i thought wed just sneak off and not make a big scene
you could make a little scene
and here i am making it
andrew and i are going to washington in the morning
why are you going to washington
its the mother of all fund raisers at american
i thought i mentioned it

i thought since you two are going away soon
to kym and im sure you dont want any grown ups around checking up on you
will you still be here when i get back
kym doesnt say anything
what about our post nuptial wedding gossip reconnaissance mom
well can you come by early
of course you dont want to do that
its your wedding night
you dont want to get up early
i have to get andrew organized
and well be back in a bit
it was such a lovely wedding darling
she bends in for a kiss
i want my mother and my sister
rachel wraps one arm around kyms neck and the other round her mother and hugs them both to her
she has her eyes open
they have their eyes open
they are stiff as boards
rachel stops hugging and looks from one to the other
her mom and sister look at her and each other
will you call me every day about
she pats rachels tummy
all right then
good bye son in law
kym and rachel watch their mother leave the room
horrified i saw your mothers underwear
kym sees abby and andrew crossing the front porch through the window
i cant find my cigarettes
kym moves quickly from the room
kym is heading for the front door when paul breaks away from a group of guests having coffee in the dining room and nabs her pulling her into a conversation
with a wedding guest
speak of the devil
you remember susanna galeano
she doesnt hi
kym is looking out the dining room window between paul and susanna she spots abby and andrew walking down the driveway towards the valets at the street
susanna has a public relations firm and she just lost one of her assistants
theyre an epidemic
your father gave me my start about a hundred years ago
we could definitely use an extra body right about now
have you ever thought about public relations
the public is kind of afraid of me
susanna and paul laugh
the firm is opening an office right here in town just in time for the holidays
you could stay right here
have you ever thought about p
logistically its just a dream
you could stay in your old room
i could chauffeur you around
you wouldnt have to worry about rent
have you already talked to carol about me staying here
shes fine about it
you could stay in your old room
why dont you give me a call on monday okay
she hands kym a business card and kisses paul on the cheek
it was just beautiful
suzys first rate
can be fascinating
you always said it was stupid
i meant stupid
do you want me to hold that for you
youve got no pockets
ive got it
ill be right back
at the edge of the porch kym sees abby standing in the moonlight at the front of the driveway with andrew waiting for their car
abby turns her head slightly in kyms direction
kym in the half dark watches her mother
abby does not move a muscle
kym steps off the porch
the valet pulls up in the car jumps out
abby fixes her gaze on andrew as he opens the door for her
they drive off
the absolute end of a wedding
the place is a gorgeous mess of wedding detritus
the tent looks so lonely
a weary caterer packs away his trays
kieran is talking and smoking with sidney at the end of the lawn
a freshly scrubbed kym in her own clothes takes a moment in ethans room
she collects a few snapshots of her sister and brother and stuffs them in her shoulder bag
as kym approaches the stairs emma staggers into the hallway bleary eyed
she is in her underwear heading for the bathroom
she stops at the sight of kym
they stare at each other
emma gives a tiny wave
kym responds heads down the stairs
kym slipping quietly downstairs
she moves to collect her weird mish mash of bags waiting by the door
kieran is there
you scared me
making a break for it
i have to go
i was coming to find you
you dont have to slip away without making any noise you know
i like noise
i was coming to find you
my rides outside
if you need anything
if i need to post bond
kieran hands kym a folded piece of paper
if you ever need anything
thank you kieran
maybe youll come visit me in hawaii
that would be nice
he smiles kisses her tenderly
she hugs him fiercely
i have to go
kym looks back in through the window sees her father awake in his robe tired gamely tidying
unbelievably softly and tenderly dad
carol comes up behind paul envelopes him in a gentle bear hug
a maroon camry is idling in the circular driveway out front exhaust vaporizing against the chilly morning air
a cute two year old girl is visible in a carseat and rosa the staff nurse from kyms halfway house is at the wheel
the car radio plays quietly as kym opens the passenger door wiggling her finger at the little girl
like a ghost rachel appears on the porch
kym jumps a little
the sisters lock eyes
kym looks pained
paul is still moving around in there
she wants to go
rachel floats down the porch stairs and joins her sister at the car
she takes in rosa who meets rachels look with a nod
whispering will you tell dad
kym is crying
i love your baby
rachel hugs her sister fiercely
kym gets into the passenger seat but leaves the car door open
rachel smiles her huge luminous smile
kym shuts the car door and rolls down the window
rachel mouths bye and gives a little wave
the car pulls out of the driveway carol watching it go from the dining room window
