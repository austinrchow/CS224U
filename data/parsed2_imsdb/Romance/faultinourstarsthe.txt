written by scott neustadter michael h
weber based on the novel by john green may hazel grace lancaster lies in the grass staring up at the stars
were close on her face and we hear you have a choice in this world i believe about how to tell sad stories
cut to a series of quick images hazel and the boy we will come to know as augustus gus waters at an outdoor restaurant in some magical place
they look very much like the perfect hollywood couple
on the one hand you can sugar coat the way they do in movies and romance novels
perfect hazel and perfect gus sit on a bench overlooking an incredible seascape in some foreign country
she rests her head on his shoulder
where villains are vanquished and
heroes are born and
perfect hazel and perfect gus kiss in a dark room
beautiful people learn beautiful lessons
perfect hazel and perfect gus fall onto a bed together
they look deep into one anothers eyes
and nothing is too messed up that cant be fixed with an apology and a peter gabriel song
back to hazel on the grass still watching the stars
were those dreams or were they memories
i like that way as much as the next girl believe me
its just not the truth
hazel closes her eyes
this is the truth
and everything goes black
we hear sorry
the real hazel is no less beautiful than the one we just saw
late in the winter of my th year
there are however some key and obvious differences
first youll notice the oxygen tube in her nostrils which help her to breathe
second youll notice her hair which we couldnt see in the grass
its much shorter than the perfect version the result of someone whose head was completely shaved a few years before
my mother decided i was depressed
im not depressed
hazels legs dangle over the side of an exam table
her mother frannie early s younger than she feels explains to the doctor she eats like a bird
she barely leaves the house im not depressed
she reads the same book over and over
im not depressed
off her look cut to quick sequence which play over the booklets and web sites always list depression as a side effect of cancer
a shopping mall
filled with teenage girls gossipping laughing being teenage girls basically
and heres hazel
with her mom
and her oxygen tank
just another day
depressions not a side effect of cancer
hazels living room
she sits watching game shows in the middle of the afternoon
her mom brings her a sandwich
a glass of water
and then a whole host of prescription meds
hazel eyes them with indifference
its a side effect of dying
hazel sits alone reading a dog eared heavily underlined copy of a novel an imperial affliction by peter van houten
she only looks up when distracted by a squeal of delight
a young guy has lifted a young girl over his shoulder playfully
he spins her around
hazel watches a beat goes back to the book
which is what was happening to me
and we cut back to frannie continues to talk to the doctor
hazel continues to dangle her feet
some days she wont even get out of bed
the doctor scratches his beard thinking
i may switch you to zoloft
and twice a day instead of once
why stop there
keep em coming
i can take it
im like the keith richards of cancer kids
the doctor looks at frannie who just shakes her head
have you been going to that support group i suggested
instead of answering hazel looks at her mom
shes gone a few times
im not sure its for me
if youre depressed im not de support groups are a great way to connect with people who are
on the same journey
just give it a chance ok
hazel rolls her eyes knows shes lost this battle
you might even find it
close up on patrick s pony tail
he has a guitar
we are gathered here today literally in the heart of jesus
angle on hazel who just shakes her head
this is the lamest thing she could be doing right now
who would like to share their story with the group
the basement is filled with sick people
hazel among them
most are under the age of
it started a few years ago when i was
as hazel watches bored and patrick continues we hear ill spare you the gory details of patricks ball cancer
basically they found it in his nuts cut most of it out he almost died but he didnt die and now here he is divorced friendless addicted to video games
exploiting his cancertastic past in the heart of jesus literally to show us that one day if were lucky we could be just like him
they all say were here for you patrick
hazel says it the least enthusiastically
she locks eyes with her only friend in support group a blonde kid with an eye patch isaac
hes also shaking his head
who else would like to share
patrick gestures for her to speak
reluctantly she stands sighs
im uh hazel
thyroid originally but with quite the impressive satellite colony in my lungs
not much more to say hazel is about to sit down
and how are you doing hazel
hazel has no idea how to answer that
you mean besides the terminal cancer
but thats not what she says
she says alright
isaac tries not to laugh at this
hazel sits back down
were here for you hazel
this is not at all helpful
a few more beats
maybe now ill play a song
frannie sits in the car in the parking lot reading from a book waiting for group to be over
she sees the church door open and puts the book away
hazel comes out
frannie looks at her like well was it great
hazel just exhales and gets in the car
cut to americas next top model is on the tv
hazel sits on one side of the l shaped couch flipping through her novel
frannie and hazels dad michael s kind doing his best to stay positive sit on the other side watching her but trying not to make it seem that way
after a few beats its friday night
i was just thinking
you should call your friends see what theyre up to
frannie and michael look at one another dont say anything
wanna see a movie
hazel looks up from the book
sees her parents
gets an idea
why dont you guys go to a movie
off their look
you havent been out in a while
take the night off
frannie and michael look at one another again
this is a really good show
and just like that everyone goes back to what they were doing
cut to quick sequence which plays over and that was my life
hazel watching tv book in hand
hazel in another doctors office
hazel popping pills
eight prescription drugs three times a day
hazel and her parents in the kitchen
and worse worse worst of all
you cant make me
of course we can were your parents
hazel you need to get out of the house
be a teenager
if you want me to be a teenager dont send me to support group
buy me a fake id so i can go to clubs and drink gimlets and take pot
you dont take pot
see thats the kind of thing i would know with a fake id
get in the car
hazel mock stabs herself in the stomach with an invisible sword
cut to a small episcopalian sanctuary in suburban indianapolis
and so i went
frannies car pulls up close to the back entrance
not because i wanted to or because i thought it would help
but for the same reason i did anything these days
hazel oxygen tank in toe gets out of the car with frannies assistance
to make my parents happy
are you gonna sit here and wait the whole time
of course not no
she totally is i have errands to run
hazel knows shes not planning to run any errands
she doesnt press the issue
love you too mom
the only thing worse than biting it from cancer is having a kid bite it from cancer
as frannie gets back in the car she shouts to her daughter
make some friends
hazel just shakes her head
cut to hazel walks towards the elevator
an extremely sick looking kid holds it open for her
hazel thinks better of it
ill take the stairs
the kid nods
the doors shut
hazel is reminded it could always be worse
she turns to go walking right into ooph
a supremely beautiful boy we will come to know him as gus
tall lean muscular straight short mahogany hair blue eyes
hazel has never seen a better looking kid in her life
for a brief moment the earth stops
they stand looking at one another
hazel is speechless
with the beautiful boy watching a wan smile on his face hazel shuffles off as fast as she can ducking into hazel catches her breath
shakes her head
surprised at herself
she looks in the mirror
so doesnt like what she sees
the earth starts moving again
cut to hazel sits in the circle of sick
who would like to begin
hazel catches sight of the beautiful boy sitting next to isaac
he seems to be watching her that same flirty smile on his face
she self consciously looks away
isaac i know youre facing a challenging time
perhaps you would like to say something
isaac nods rises
its looking like another surgery in a couple weeks
after which well ill be blind
hazel tries to focus on what isaacs saying but its difficult
she still feels the beautiful boys gaze on her
not that im complaining or anything
i know a lot of you have it way worse but still i mean you know being blinds gonna suck
as isaac shares the beautiful boy doesnt look away from hazel
hazel finds this intimidating
and intimidation irritates her
so she decides to play the game with him meeting his gaze and holding it just as firmly
a staring contest
my girlfriend helps
and friends like augustus here
isaac nods towards the beautiful boy who now has a name augustus
he still doesnt look away from hazel
thats whats up
were here for you isaac
the staring contest continues another few beats until and does your friend want to speak
this causes the beautiful boy to momentarily look away
aha hes lost the contest
hazel smiles flicks her eyebrows up as if to say victory is mine
he smiles back at her the most radiant smile on the planet
he turns back to the group
im augustus waters
had a touch of osteosarcoma bout a year and a half ago lost this baby as a result
gus holds up his right leg a prosthetic
but really im just here at isaacs request
and how are you feeling augustus
oh im grand
im on a roller coaster that only goes up my friend
gus catches this
embarrassed she stops smiling and looks away
perhaps youd like to share your fears with the group augustus
gus thinks about this
angle on hazel intrigued
i intend to live an extraordinary life
to be remembered
if im scared of anything its
not doing that
patrick doesnt quite have the tools to deal with that
would uh anyone like to speak to that
and hazels hand goes up
even patrick is surprised by that
hazel stands takes a second to gather her thoughts
augustus watches her waits for it
i just wanna say
there will come a time when you know all of us are dead
gus is now even more fixed on her than before
it might be tomorrow
might be a million years from now but
its gonna happen
and when it does enough generations will come and go therell be no one left to remember cleopatra
or muhammad ali let alone any of us right
the look on guss face is unreadable
and if that scares you well i suggest you ignore it
god knows its what everyone else does
and then an enormous smile spreads across guss face not a flirty smile but a surprised one a real one
cut to hazel waits for her moms car to appear
across the parking lot she sees isaac going at it with a redhead monica sucking face like theres no tomorrow against the door of her green pontiac firebird
between kisses we can hear always
and hazel hears literally
hazel turns to find the beautiful boy augustus standing right next to her
i thought we were in a church basement but apparently we were literally in the heart of jesus
someone should probably tell him dont you think
seems kinda dangerous keeping all these kids with cancer in your heart
whats your name
no your full name
hazel grace lancaster
gus nods to himself smiles
still fixated on her
i didnt say anything
why are you looking at me like that
because youre beautiful
hazel is taken aback
no ones ever said that to her before
i enjoy looking at beautiful people and i decided a while back not to deny myself the simpler pleasures of existence
particularly given that as you so astutely pointed out were all gonna die pretty soon
im not beaut a cute young girl walks past them
hazel isnt surprised that other girls know gus
of course they do
she turns back towards isaac and monica pawing at each other
she hears always
whats with the always
always is their thing
theyll always love each other and whatnot
must have texted always to each other at least four million times this year
they continue to watch the show
its pretty gross
isaac squeezes monicas breast like a clown horn
hes gotta be hurting her boob
lets watch a movie
hazel is again surprised
pretty free this no i mean now
what do you mean now
ive got a car
hazel has never seen someone so confident
you could be an axe murderer
there is that possibility
come on hazel grace
take a risk
as hazel mulls this over gus reaches into his pocket and pulls out of all things a pack of cigarettes
hazel is in disbelief
he flips the box open puts a cigarette between his lips
oh my god
youre kidding right
off his look you just ruined the whole thing
what you think thats cool
oh you idiot
theres always a hamartia isnt there
and yours is even though you had freaking cancer you give money to a corporation for the chance to acquire even more cancer
and you were doing so well
as she rants gus continues to look at her with that smile on his face
hazel does not find it so amusing
let me tell you
not being able to breathe
hazel folds her arms and turns away from him
a fatal flaw
gus takes a beat and then moves to face her the smile still etched on his face
they dont hurt you unless you light them
ive never lit one
hazel turns back to him
its a metaphor
you put the thing that kills you between your teeth
but you dont give it the power to do the killing
hazel is floored
gus holds her gaze
and its at this point frannie pulls up
ready for some model
hazel looks at gus cigarette dangling from his lips
cool as anything
handsome as hell
she looks back at her mom
off her confused look ive made plans with augustus waters
and with that she walks off
frannie looks at the boy with the cigarette in his mouth
this could be trouble
and we cut to hazel is terrified
turns out gus is the worlds worst driver
when he brakes her body flies forward against the seatbelt
and when he hits the gas seconds later her neck snaps back in the seat
gus sees the look on her face
i failed the test a couple times
you dont say
most amputees can drive with no problem but
im surprised you have a license
tell me about it
another brake forces hazel against the seat belt
the fourth time i took the test
it was going about how this is going
and when it was over the instructor looks at me and goes your driving while unpleasant
is not technically unsafe
total cancer perk
a few beats of silence
so what happened to you
hazel takes a deep breath
shes told this story before but somehow this seems different
i was when they found it
and as she speaks we see it unfold
smash cut to year old hazel has a biopsy
stage iv thyroid cancer
year old hazel on the operating table
its a nightmare
i had surgery first
this poor little girl is taking a beating
and its just getting started
having her head shaved by frannie
with a picc line in a chemo chair
all of which worked for a while
a radiologist looks at an x ray
hes not pleased
and then stopped working
year old hazel lies in bed struggling to breathe
frannie runs her fingers through her hair
and then my lungs started filling up with water
in the icu her parents standing over her
that should have been the end
through the tears are you ready sweetie
year old hazel nods
michael cant keep it together any longer
he completely breaks down
but it wasnt
the sun shines in the room
year old hazel eats ice chips the color has returned to her cheeks
the antibiotics kicked in
they drained the fluid from my lungs
and in time i got better
slightly older hazel is getting more intravenous medication
its never ending
i even found myself in an experimental trial
you know the ones that are famous in the republic of cancervania for not working
a second radiologist examines a second x ray
its called phalanxifor
didnt work in over percent of patients but for some reason
the radiologist looks surprised
it worked in me
they called it the miracle
and finally back to gus has one eye on the road the other on hazel
he was impressed with her before
hes totally dazzled now
tumors shrank my mets have hardly grown since
of course my lungs still suck but theoretically they could continue to suck in just this way for i dunno a while maybe
so are you back in school or
got my ged
a college girl
well that explains the aura of sophistication
he smiles at her
she smiles back
shoves his upper arm playfully
theyre easing into each other
eventually guss car pulls into his driveway
hes as good at parking as he is at driving
cut to hazel follows gus inside
she quickly notices all sorts of engraved plaques and framed signs with phrases like home is where the heart is and true love is born from hard times
hazel looks at gus quizzically
my parents call them encouragements
rolling his eyes dont ask
guss mom and dad s are in the kitchen making dinner
guss parents dont seem surprised to see gus with some random girl in their house
hazel takes note of that
this is hazel grace
hows it going just hazel
downstairs if you need us
gus drags hazel to the next room
as shes pulled nice to meet you
they walk down the carpeted stairs gus having an easier time with his one leg than hazel is with her oxygen tank and weak lungs
eventually they arrive at guss basement bedroom
theres a tv with a video game console a few band posters and a whole host of basketball memorabilia autographed sneakers school trophies framed images etc
gus sees her looking at them
i used to play
must have been pretty good
these are mine
the rest of its just cancer perks
gus grabs a dvd from his stack of dvds
hazel sits down on the bed her breathing noticeably heavier
need to sit
gus sits down next to her on the bed
dont get any ideas
catching her breath all that standing
and then more standing
lotta standing for me
ill be fine in a minute
unless i faint
im a bit of a victorian lady fainting wise
he waits for her breathing to slow down
in time you ok
hazel nods smiles
so whats your story
i already told you my story
i was not your cancer story
interests hobbies passions weird fetishes
dont tell me youre one of those people who becomes their disease
i dont know
i reject that out of hand
beat hazel shrugs think of something you love
first thing that comes to mind
an imperial affliction
its a novel
my favorite novel
does it have zombies
its not that kind of book
its not its
kind of my bible actually
whats it about
off his look but not in that way trust me
the guy who wrote it peter van houten hes
well the only person ive ever come across who seems to a understand what its like to be dying and b not have died
in that case
i am going to read this horrible book with the boring title that does not contain zombies or stormtroopers
and in exchange
gus pulls a book from his bookshelf
all i ask is that you read this brilliant and haunting novelization of my favorite video game
hazel looks at the slim ridiculous novella
shes adorable when she laughs
she takes the book from him and as she does their hands get tangled together for a brief charged moment
your hands are cold
not so much cold as under oxygenated
ooh hazel grace
i love it when you talk medical to me
and off her completely smitten smile cut to
hazel sits in bed reading guss novella
frannie stands in the doorway notices the new book
frannie looks intrigued
did he give it to you
by it do you mean herpes
frannie rolls her eyes
hazels phone buzzes
she excitedly checks it only to be disappointed
im sure hell call dont worry
im not worried
its not like im waiting for him to call or anything
we hung out
no big deal
frannie says nothing to that
her silence says it all
hazel rolls her eyes
cut to hazel continues not to wait for guss call
we see her brushing her teeth
and checking her phone
and checking her phone
and checking her phone
looking out the window on a rainy day
trying not to check her phone
willing herself to not check the goddamn phone
and checking the phone
where is he
did he forget about her
hazel at the dinner table with her parents
shes a little sullen barely touching her food
hazels phone buzzes
she tries not to seem too eager to check it what with her parents watching and all
she subtly looks down at her lap
and sure enough a text from gus
her eyes bug out
tell me my copy is missing the last ten pages or something
goes back to eating
frannie and michael share a quick glance
a second later theres a follow up text
tell me i have not reached the end of this book
hazel smiles again
and then a third text hazel now laughs out loud
michael clears his throat
hazel looks up
would you like to be excused
hazel sits down on a patio chair and dials the phone
gus answers on the first ring
welcome to the sweet torture of reading an imperial at which point she hears a loud wail coming from the other end of the phone
what the are you ok
intercut between hazel on the patio and isaacs head is buried in guss couch
hes wailing like a banshee having some kind of nervous breakdown
i am however with isaac
hazel hears more wailing
has no idea what to make of it
does support group hazel make this better or worse
hazel genuinely has no idea what the hell is going on
hazel waits a few beats for gus to come back on
finally how fast can you get here
hazel thinks about this
and on her face cut to hazel descends the steps
she hears an ungodly moan before she sees anyone
what has she gotten herself into
gus appears at the base
calling to isaac isaac hazel from support group is coming downstairs
gus waits for a response
he gestures for her to follow him into the room
before he does a gentle reminder isaac is in the midst of a psychotic episode
you look nice by the way
hazel blushes follows gus into the room to find isaac sitting upside down in a gaming chair
tears are flowing down his reddened cheeks
empty soda cans and bags of junk food lie around him
how ya doing isaac
again no response
hazel looks to gus for an explanation
seems isaac and monica are no longer a going concern
oh im sorry
do you want to talk about it
isaac starts to sob again
he just wants to cry and play video games
it doesnt hurt to talk to him however
if you have any sage words of feminine advice
i actually think his response is appropriate
pain demands to be felt
lights up at that youre quoting my book
gus winks at her
at which point isaac lets out another howl
gus gestures for hazel to sit
the two of them flank isaac
he finally speaks
she didnt want to do it after the surgery
said she couldnt handle it
im about to lose my eyesight and she cant handle it
hazel rubs his shoulder in sympathy
i kept saying always to her
always always always
and she just kept talking over me and not saying it back
it was like i was already gone you know
always was a promise
you cant break promises
sometimes people dont understand the promises theyre making when they make them
right sure but you keep the promise anyway
thats what love is
love is keeping the promise anyway
that could be an encouragement
its silent for a beat
and then isaac stands up a funny look on his face
suddenly isaac starts kicking his chair across the room
here we go
the chair lands against the bed
gus hands isaac something else to throw a pillow
isaac grabs the pillow and slams it against the wall
he dives on it and beings pummeling the pillow like a maniac
punch that thing
and so he does
as he continues to gus looks at hazel cigarette dangling from his mouth
ive been wanting to call you on a nearly minutely basis but i have been waiting until i could form a coherent thought in re an imperial affliction
i cant stop thinking about it
i know right
the only problem is the ending
it is rather abrupt
i mean i totally get that she died or whatever anna
but there is an unwritten contract between author and reader and i think ending your book in the middle of a sentence kind of violates that contract
but thats part of what i like about it
it portrays death truthfully
you die in the middle of your life in the middle of a sentence
but i do god i do want to know what happens to everyone else
yeah like her mom
the dutch tulip man
sysiphus the hamster
gus totally gets the book
a bond between them
have you tried contacting this
peter van houten
ive written letters
hes never responded
apparently he moved to amsterdam became a recluse
hasnt published anything
doesnt do interviews
turns to isaac isaac
gus stands and takes the pillow out of isaacs hand
pillows dont break
gus hands isaac one of his basketball trophies
you need to break something
isaac looks at it then back to gus as if asking permission
isaac holds it over his head and smash
the trophy breaks into a million pieces
isaac almost smiles
gus hands him another
go to town my friend
and isaac does
smashing them one by one
hazel looks at gus
ive been looking for a way to tell my dad that i kinda hate basketball
think maybe weve found it
isaac grabs more of the trophies smashing them to pieces
gus and hazel enjoy the spectacle
when there are none left isaac is panting standing over the bronze carnage
isaac thinks about it
shakes his head no
gus puts his arm around him but looks at hazel
thats the thing about pain
it demands to be felt
and on her face we cut to where hazel is having dinner with her parents
maria called today
the pet scan is set for the eighth
this could be a source of worry but shes not going to think about that right now
and shes actually eating which her parents cant help but notice
frannie and michael look at one another pleased
i told you support group was a good idea
hazels phone buzzes
she looks to her parents
by all means
hazel lays on the grass in her backyard staring up at the stars
she rings him back and as she does splitscreen w hazel in the grass and gus upside down in bed a laptop on his chest
so i read it again
and i just kept feeling like
like it was a gift
like youd given me something important
on the other hand
we need closure dont we
what we need is a sequel
we need to know what happens to annas family after she dies
thats what i kept asking van houten for in my letters
but he never wrote back
because hes a recluse
gus clears his throat smiles
i am writing to thank you for your electronic correspondence received this th of april
hazel sits up
could it be
i am grateful to anyone who sets aside the time to read my book
i found his assistant
i emailed her
she must have forwarded it to him
hazel is stunned shall i continue
keep reading keep reading
i am particularly indebted to you sir both for your kind words about an imperial affliction and for taking the time to tell me that the book and here i
quote you directly meant a great deal to you
hazel pays attention to every word
to answer your question no i have not written anything else nor will i
i do not feel that continuing to share my thoughts with readers would benefit either them or me
however thank you again for your generous email
yours most sincerely peter van houten
youre making this up
hazel grace could i with my meager intellectual capabilities make up a letter from the great peter van houten
would you mind
go check your in box
hazel jumps up as fast as her lungs will allow
cut to hazel sits at her computer van houtens assistants email address staring her in the face
the cursor blinks on a blank page
and then hazel starts writing
peter van houten my name is hazel grace lancaster
my friend augustus waters who read your book at my recommendation just received an email from you at this address
i hope you will not mind that he shared that email with me
while hazel reads the letter we see a series of scenes showing the next several days
they include hazel and gus drinking coffees at a cafe
hes enthusiastically telling a story and shes enjoying every moment of it
hazel helping gus become a better driver
its no use
i was wondering if you wouldnt mind answering a few questions i have about what happens after the end of the book
specifically the in his kitchen laughing trying to make omelettes
does annas mom marry the dutch tulip man is the dutch tulip man up to something or is he just misunderstood
what happens to annas friends
their bodies almost touching
but not quite
lastly i was hoping you could shed some light on sisyphus the hamster
these questions have haunted me for years
and i dont know how long i have left to get answers to them
and finally back in hazels bedroom
she finishes reading this letter into the phone
i know these are not important literary questions and that your book is full of important literary questions but i would just really like to know
intercut w gus bouncing a ball against the wall listening
reading it aloud to him and of course if ever you do decide to write anything else even if you dont want to publish it id love to read it
frankly id read your grocery lists
yours with great admiration hazel grace lancaster
but then again van houten uses words like tendentious and
bacchanalia so i think hell like it
hazel smiles looks at a clock
is it really almost
i gotta get to sleep
neither one of them want to hang up the phone
they both laugh at this
perhaps ok will be our always
gus hangs up
we stay with hazel
is it really possible this beautiful boy likes her
she thinks about it
shes not convinced
cut to isaac lies in bed bandages covering his eyes now officially blind
a nurse attends to him while hazel sits by his side
she hasnt even visited
fourteen months we were together
what kind of person
youll get over her isaac
just takes a little time
the nurse exits the room
is she gone
did she really just say youll see
shakes her head qualities of a good nurse
doesnt pun your disability
gets blood on the first try
that is huge
i mean seriously is this my freakin arm or a dartboard
three no condescending voice
lays it on thick im gonna stab you with this needle now so there might be a little ouchie
they laugh and then lapse into silence for a moment
you doing alright isaac
i dont know
to be honest i think a hell of a lot more about monica than my eye
is that crazy
its a little crazy
but i believe in love you know
i dont believe that everybody gets to keep their eyes or not get sick or whatever but everybody should have true love
dont you think
hazel thinks about it as isaac presses the button on his pain pump self administering morphine
gus was here earlier
trying to be nonchalant was he
isaac exhales as the pain pump starts to kick in
off his slow nod good
isaac closes his eyes what about gus
but isaac is already asleep
whatever he was going to say about gus is gone
hazel nods pats his hand
cut to hazel rolls out of bed stumbles to her computer
she casually checks her in box and is shocked to discover hes written her back
i cannot answer your questions at least not in writing because to do so would constitute a sequel which you might publish or otherwise share on the internet
not that i dont trust you but how could i trust you i barely know you
hazels jaw hangs open as she reads the next part should ever you find yourself in amsterdam do pay a visit at your leisure
yours most sincerely peter van houten son of a what
frannie races in clearly expecting a health problem
realizing she scared her nothing
hazel shows frannie the note
frannie reads it
can we go to amsterdam
frannie thinks about how to respond for a beat
i love you and
you know id do anything for you but we dont
we dont have the money
the expense of getting equipment over there love its just not possible
no yeah of course
clearly frannie feels awful
which makes hazel feel awful
i mean i could talk to your father mom no
dont do anything
forget i mentioned it
a beat between them
frannie walks out sadly
hazel sits on the bed totally bummed now for two reasons
guilt is definitely a side effect of cancer
hazel and gus walk together on the sidewalk
just use your wish
ive used it already
whatd you do
hazel doesnt want to say
tell me you did not go to disney world
hazel looks away hazel grace
you did not use your one dying wish to go to disney world
and epcot center
hands in the air oh my god
we had fun on that trip
that is the saddest thing ive ever heard
i met goofy
now im embarrassed
why are you embarrassed
how can i have a crush on a girl with such cliche wishes
the word crush has taken hazel totally by surprise
she looks at him
she quickly looks away blushing
gus continues on about disney but all hazel can think about is crush
she tries not to seem too excited
cut to hazel in a hospital gown is slowly fed through the machine
a tech explains that she should hold still try and relax etc
but hazel knows
she knows all about these procedures
shes a pro
cut to gus is waiting on the front stoop when frannies car pulls up
theyre home from the hospital
he wears an indiana pacers jersey and carries a bouquet of bright orange tulips
michael gets out of the passengers seat to help hazel out of the car
gus rises to assist them
is that a rik smits jersey
it is indeed
man i loved that guy
hazel sees gus wasnt expecting him
how would you like to go on a picnic
gus is with frannie and michael downstairs
something to drink
im great mrs
meanwhile upstairs hazel gets ready for the date
shes put the orange flowers in a toothbrush holder and is putting on lip gloss
she can faintly hear the conversation downstairs
angle on gus sitting on the stairs
michael next to him
youre a survivor yourself
taps his leg didnt cut this fella off for the hell of it
though it is an excellent weight loss strategy
legs are heavy
hows your health now
n e c for fourteen months
im very lucky
angle on hazel checking herself out in the mirror
seems to like what she sees a lot more than before
back on gus and michael downstairs son you have to understand
hazels still pretty sick
she will be the rest of her life
angle on hazel who can hear all of this
she stops what shes doing and listens
shell want to keep up with you shes that kind of girl but the truth is her lungs you ready gus
hazel appears silencing her father mid sentence
cut to behind the indianapolis museum of art is acres of gardens and grounds
hazel and gus walk together
is this where you bring all your romantic conquests
every last one
probably why im still a virgin
hazel laughs elbows him
youre not a virgin
off his look are you really
gus picks a stick up from the dirt
draws a big circle in it
this circle is virgins
now gus draws a much smaller circle inside that circle
is year old dudes with one leg
he grabs her hand helps her walk up a tiny hill
once up there gus lays a blanket on the ground
they sit looking out over a rather odd sculpture a set of giant white bones where children can jump and play
funky bones by joep van lieshout
he sounds dutch
and he is
much like rik smits
hazel raises an eyebrow at gus
hes sure taking this amsterdam dutch thing pretty far
he removes some sandwiches and orange juice out of a basket
let me guess dutch cheese
she takes one the tomatoes are mexican
they eat for a second their eyes watching the children play on the bones
how cool is that
a skeleton being used as a playground
you do love your symbols
speaking of which
gus stands up takes a cigarette puts it in his mouth
he clears his throat
youre probably wondering why youre sitting here eating a bad cheese sandwich and drinking orange juice with a guy in a rik smits jersey
it has crossed my mind
hazel grace like so many before you and i say this with great affection you spent your wish
i was thir hush
im in the midst of a grand soliloquy here
you were young
the grim reaper staring you in the face
and the fear of dying with your one true wish left ungranted led you to rush into making one you didnt really want for how could little hazel grace having
never read an imperial affliction ever know that her one true wish was to visit mr
peter van houten in his amsterdamian exile
hazel nods in agreement
if you were smart you would have saved your wish til the time in your life when you really knew your true self
gus stops talking
hazel is confused
didnt save it
good thing i saved mine
hazel cocks her head to one side
what is he talking about
got it in exchange for the leg
and i still have it
she starts to realize
are you saying im not gonna give you my wish or anything
but i too have an interest in meeting peter van houten and it wouldnt make much sense to meet him without the girl who introduced me to his book now
hazels eyes widen i talked to the genies and theyre in total agreement
we leave on may third
hazel is so excited that she grabs gus and pulls him into a hug
their faces close lips inches apart and just when it looks like something might happen wait a minute
are you only doing this so ill kiss you
gus blinks a few times
cause id totally kiss you either way
and kiss him she does
and when its over they sit back look at one another
a magic moment
why are you doing this
because hazel grace
i found my wish
and hazel is beyond touched
we hear are you out of your mind
frannie folds laundry while hazel pleads her case
its too much haze
we cant accept something like that from a virtual stranger
hes not a stranger
dont be gross
its still no im afraid
can we at least ask dr
where hazels oncologist dr
maria shakes her head
thats out of the question
you said the pet scan was encouraging
the pet scan is encouraging
we just dont know how long itll stay that way
what if you get sick in a foreign country
they have doctors in amsterdam
someone will know what to do
be that as it may without someone familiar with your particular case i cant turns to her mom so youll come too
the genies can hook it up
youve never been to amsterdam have you mom
and judging from her face seems shed kinda like to
maria looks at frannie shrugs kids got a point
and on that smile we smash cut to over which we hear and then this happened
note theres no sound in this sequence
hazel wakes up screaming in the middle of the night shaking and holding her head
frannie and michael burst in
mom grabs her crying daughter frightened beyond belief waves to michael to call for help
people talk about the courage of cancer patients
and i do not deny that courage
he leaves the room to do so and fran stays behind rocking with her daughter promising her itll all be ok
whatever nightmare this is its going to end
cut to still silent
michael drives trying to keep it together
frannies in the back with hazels head in her lap
hazel continues to scream in silence whether from pain or terror we do not know
id been poked and stabbed and poisoned for years and still i trod on
michael carries hazel into the chaotic emergency room
theyre practically running
theres still no sound
but make no mistake
the doctors rally to assist the screaming crying child
shes wheeled away from her family who can only watch
we stay with her and we hear in that moment i would have been very very happy to die
the sound returns
and its the sound of a heart monitor
its also the sound of a working heart
hazel has made it through
her eyes open
a nurse is there
youre ok hazel
even hazel seems surprised by that
would you like to see your parents
the nurse goes to get them
soon they come bounding in crying and kissing her repeatedly
so much relief
cut to later
hazels bed has been raised up so she can talk to her parents comfortably
they thought it was a brain tumor
it wasnt thank god
so what happened
fluid in the lungs preventing oxygenation
they put that in
theres a tube in hazels side draining fluid into a plastic bladder that hangs off her bed
drained a liter and a half last night
thats a lot of fluid
the good news is
no tumor growth
no new tumors in your body
that is a relief
were all so relieved
frannie embraces her daughter
this is just a thing hazel
its a thing we can live with
hazel nods again
only in the universe of hazel grace lancaster is something like this just a thing
meanwhile heres gus his foot tapping nervously on the floor
its unclear how long hes been waiting there
he sees michael walk down the hall
races after him
hows she doing
better thank you
gus nods as relieved as the rest of them
they wont let me in
im sorry no i get it
will you just
will you tell her i was here
of course i will
and sits back down
though he wont get to see her he still wants to stay
michael really likes this kid
why dont you go home get some rest
gus looks up
that might be for the best
cut to hazel and her parents sit at a very large conference table along with dr
maria and three other oncologists her whole cancer team
the great news is
phalanxifor continues to control your tumor growth
the not so great news is were still seeing serious problems with fluid accumulation
so how should we proceed
hazel looks around the room waits for someone to answer
no one does
um i feel like im not the most qualified person to answer that
i was talking to dr
simmons late s white beard old school speaks next
its a strange case
normally the tumors start resisting the treatment
but that hasnt happened here yet
hazel hears the yet the loudest
unfortunately the drug may be worsening the edema
but if we stopped it entirely were likely to face even graver dangers
so were gonna do nothing
thats what we have to decide
the truth is
very few people have been on phalanxifor as long as hazel has
we dont really know the long term effects
that comforts no one
cant i just get like a lung transplant or something
the doctors look at one another like who wants to take that one
eventually you would not be considered a
strong candidate for a transplant
hazel takes that in nods tries to pretend it didnt bother her
sensitive michael on the other hand starts to cry a little bit
he grabs frannies hand
were trying to prevent endothelial growth while at the same time preventing immunosorbent
simmons drones on with some cancer gobbledygook hazels eyes remain firmly fixed on her parents
she hates what shes doing to them
and seeing them holding hands crying but trying not to cry it jogs a memory
cut to we saw this once before
it looks like the end for year old hazel
her father is weeping off to the side while her mom stands over her holding her hand and asking through the tears are you ready sweetie
year old hazel nods
the doctors get to work
the anaesthetic takes hold and hazel goes under
but not enough
cause she totally hears her mother say i wont be a mom anymore
she falls into her husbands chest
and were back to hazel comes out of the memory when her parents see her staring at them
she tries to shake it off
simmons is still talking nonsense when i have a question
can i still go to amsterdam
simmons cant help himself
everyone looks at him
he clears his throat
that would not be wise at this juncture
why not dr
the doctors are trying to be delicate here
increase some risks so does going to the mall yes but an airplane
they have oxygen on airplanes
its my life right
youre stage iv
i have this opportunity i may never have again
if the medicines working i dont see why because hazel
look i dont know any other way to say this
youre just too sick
and this is like a punch in the gut
everyone feels horrible now
maria frannie and michael and even hazel
this meeting couldnt have gone worse
and we hazel parents bring her home from the hospital
she looks miserable
its clear the last few days have been a big emotional set back
cut to her parents tuck her in
well be right outside
her phone buzzes
she looks at it
a text from gus that reads ok
hazel looks at it
and she doesnt write back
cut to hazel sits staring at nothing
the house phone rings
michael comes in from another room with the phone in hand
whispers gus again
hazel thinks about it silently shakes her head no
michael says into the phone
im sorry gus shes asleep
hazel stands and goes into her bedroom clearly depressed
hazel reads from an imperial affliction
her phone buzzes again
it just says hello
again she ignores it
and then a second text
she looks at it
the silence is deafening
she puts the phone back down
hazels heart breaks
she cant take it anymore
she picks the phone back up
she texts the following i dont know if youll understand this but i cant see you anymore
i mean i want to
she thinks about the rest
she writes im a grenade
she sends the text
and then theres more to say
she sends a second text
when i look at you all i can see is what im going to put you through
i cant have that
she sends that text
he writes back
hazel reads it
writes back ok
gus responds oh my god stop flirting with me
hazel smiles she cant help herself
but she must
she gets her emotions in check
puts the phone away
cut to an ugly day in indianapolis
inside hazel is about as miserable as the weather
the sky and the circumstances have cast a grey pall over the day
hazel walks out back
looks up at the clouds threatening rain but not yet delivering it
she sits down in the grass on the verge of tears
she looks at the old rusty swing set thats been in her backyard for years
and starts to cry
just for a few brief moments she lets herself cry
then she wipes the tears
becomes strong again
and makes a decision
hazel dials her phone
we hear hazel grace
are you crying hazel grace
whats the matter
i dont know
i want to go to amsterdam
and i want him to tell us what happens after the book and i dont want my particular life and also the sky is making me sad and theres this
old swing set that my dad made for me when i was a kid
hazel is on the verge of losing it again
a few beats of silence pass by
i demand to see this swing set of tears
hazel cant help but smile and we cut to later
same backyard only now hazel is with gus
which makes everything better
they both look at the swing set
i see your point
that is one sad swing set
hazel nudges her head onto his shoulder
thanks for coming over
you do realize
trying to keep your distance from me will in no way lessen my affection for you
hazel says nothing
all efforts to save me from you will fail
hazel looks at him
hes sure not making this easy
is this about amsterdam
cause we its not about amsterdam
its about me
i get it
one day youre going to explode in a huge ball of fire and everyone close to you will die in your wake
theres already two people in your life youre going to destroy
why add a third to that list
am i right
thats why i dont have a hamster
gus is silent
he cant argue
they stand there quietly a few more beats looking out at the swing set
until we have got to do something about this frigging swing set
hazel sits at the computer screen writing a craigslist post
gus stands next to her
swing set needs home
desperately lonely swing set needs loving home
lonely vaguely pedophilic swing set seeks butts of children
gus laughs harder
hazel laughs with him
hazel looks at him not understanding
in case you were wondering
thats why i like you
beat off her look youre so busy being you that you have no idea how utterly unprecedented you are
hazel absorbs that
her feelings for this boy in a tangle
gus and hazel watch as a townie finishes loading the swing set into the back of his pick up
gus salutes the swing set as the truck drives off
then he sneaks a quick kiss on hazels cheek
she shoots him a look
gus throws up his hands
she playfully elbows him away
hazel walks with isaac out of support group
do you like him
of course i like him
but you dont want to hook up with him
hazel doesnt know what she wants
hazel is at her computer reading a new email from lidewij vliegenthart
clearly hazel was not expecting this
dear hazel i have received word via the genies that you will be visiting us with augustus waters and your mother beginning on the th
a week away
peter and i are delighted and cannot wait to hazel is confused
she stands and walks into the hallway
frannie races out of her room in a towel dripping wet
what is it whats wrong
i didnt know you were in the shower
i was just
just trying to take a bath for five seconds
whats the matter
did you ever call the genies to tell them the trip is off
i just got an email from peter van houtons assistant
she still thinks were coming
frannie purses her lips and squints past hazel
clearly unsure what to say
frannie cant keep a straight face
im not supposed to tell you until your father gets home
were going to amsterdam
still not believing really
maria called last night and made a convincing case that you need to live hazel cant move all that fast to hug her mom so frannie comes to her and
after im getting back in the tub now
when she leaves hazel grabs her cell phone
angle on it
hazel sends gus the following text still free may
a moment later gus responds everythings coming up waters
hazel is over the moon with excitement
she smiles then tries to calm herself knowing its the best thing
whispering to her lungs one week lungs
keep your shit together one more week
luggage waits by the door including oxygen tanks and medical equipment
frannie makes breakfast as hazel enters now dressed and excited for the trip
and a moment later michael joins them
theyre all going crazy with excitement
cut to michael finishes loading up the car
kisses his wife goodbye
he embraces hazel
she hugs him back and of course he starts to cry
i love you
im so proud of you
michael lets go of her and wipes away his tears
they look at each other
unable to help himself he grabs her for another hug
hazel lets him laughing
the car is packed with oxygen tanks a suitcase for clothes another for medicines and back up medicines just in case etc
frannie pulls up to guss house
they get out of the car and head to the front door buzzing with excitement
as they get close they can hear a commotion inside
a womans voice yelling something unclear followed by frannie immediately puts her arm around hazel and quickly spins her back to the car
we cant eavesdrop hazel
back at the car far out of earshot they wait
hazel unsure what that was about
frannie politely honks the horn
a moment later gus emerges from the house smiling
a travel bag over his shoulder and a cigarette dangling from his lips
always a pleasure to see you maam
hello hazel grace
frannie doesnt know what to make of any of that
she just says when they stop and look at her amsterdam
a skycap helps hazel gus and frannie with all their bags and equipment
they wait in line for the security checkpoint
when its hazels turn she unhooks the plastic nubbins from her nose
gus places the oxygen tank on the conveyer belt
hazel takes slow careful steps through the metal detector
she seems determined to get through this without any help
but upon reaching the other side its clear that even these few steps without oxygen were a struggle
hazel holds on to the side of the conveyer belt to steady herself
as soon as her tank reappears she puts the cannula back in place
still light headed hazel closes her eyes and focuses on her breathing
she catches her mom looking at her nervously
with some difficulty amsterdam
arriving at the gate area they draw curious looks from the other passengers hazel with her oxygen tank gus with his noticeable limp and frannie helping with the equipment
a young couple gets up so that hazel and gus can sit
oh thats not necessary
but they give up their seats anyway
hazel and gus take them
we see various passengers watching
hazel ignores the attention until a little girl cute braids appears
whats in your nose
its called a cannula
these tubes give me oxygen and help me breathe
the girls mother swoops in a little frantic
oh im sorry
would they help me breathe too
hazel removes her cannula and lets the little girl try it
i think im breathing better
id love to give you my cannula but
i kinda really need the help
the little girl nods hands it back to hazel who quickly reattaches it
thanks for letting me try it
they smile at each other before the little girl walks back to her family
hazel waves back
we will now begin pre boarding flight to amsterdam
for those passengers in need of extra assistance
i think thats us
hazel sits in the middle with frannie on the aisle and gus at the window
he looks around antsy
have you never been on a plane before
gus shakes his head he has not
and hes nervous
he pulls a cigarette out of his pocket and puts it in his mouth
within seconds a flight attendant rushes over
sir you cant smoke on this plane
cigarette in his mouth i dont smoke
the flight attendant shoots him a look
its a metaphor
he puts the killing thing in his mouth but doesnt give it the power to kill him
that metaphor is prohibited on todays flight
gus nods and puts the cigarette away
flight attendants prepare for departure
the engines roar to life and the plane accelerates towards take off
gus is getting more worried by the second
he grabs the arm rest his eyes wide
gus doesnt say it back
this is what it feels like to ride in a car with you
gus grabs hazels hand as the plane lifts off
he looks out the window theyre flying
and then back to hazel
hazel smiles at his enthusiasm
holy look at that
nothing has hes adorable at this moment
hazel cant resist leaning over to give him a kiss on the cheek
not looking up from her just so you know im right here
sitting next to you
were just friends mom
hazel shoots him a look
gus shrugs what its the truth
hazel just shakes her head
cut to later
mid flight the plane is dark frannies asleep
hazel and gus watch the same gory action movie
actually he watches the movie
she just watches him watch it
he watches it with gusto
hazel continues to watch him
try as she might shes falling in love
cut to sfx the plane touching down
cut to hazel gus and frannie ride in the back of a yellow cab
were from indiana
they steal from the indians but the keep the name yes
hazel and gus share a look
something like that
meanwhile the landscape outside is flat and dusty with dirt tracks and the occasional concrete building
in other words it looks more like indianapolis than holland
to the driver this is amsterdam
yes and no
amsterdam is like the rings of a tree
it gets older as you get closer to the center
soon enough the cab takes an off ramp and turns a corner and suddenly its as if theyre transported not only to another universe but to another time as well
we see multi colored row houses lined on both sides of a windy canal
houseboats float against the edges and everyone rides bicycles down cobblestone streets
gus helps hazel and frannie bring their stuff into the room
we see a wicker basket of gifts presents from the genies welcoming their arrival
hazel exhausted sits on the bed
ill be right down the hall
hazel nods already drifting off to sleep
cut to some time later
her mom is seated in a sagging paisley chair across from the bed reading a travel guide
actually its five oclock
how was the park
never made it
i like watching you sleep
hazel shoots frannie a look
even in an exotic city her mom still cant enjoy herself
i promise ill do crazy mom stuff tonight while you and gus are at dinner
what do you mean
you have reservations at a place called oranjee
van houten set it up
very fancy according to the book
im just saying
a year old girl running free with an older boy on the streets of a foreign city famous for its vice and debauchery
is totally cool with you
is that what youre saying
beat excited lets get you dressed
hazel just shakes her head
cut to frannie opens the door to find gus in a perfectly tailored black suit cigarette dangling from his mouth
calling to the bathroom hazel
gus is here
thank you maam
a few beats later hazel emerges from the bathroom
she wears a knee length pale blue sundress
and she looks
am i under dressed
you look gorgeous
gus offers hazel his arm
she takes it
theyre ready to go
hazel and gus ride the crowded tram through the city
elm trees line the canals their pale petals blowing into the wind like a spring snowstorm
an old couple stands to give up their seats this happens all the time
hazel again tries to protest and again it falls on deaf ears
she and gus sit
they look out the window onto the city
the night just beginning
at the edge of the canal near an ancient bridge
hazel and gus are shown to a table right next to the water
your table mr
gus pulls out hazels chair for her
a waiter brings them a bottle of champagne as they sit
the champagne is our gift
hazel and gus look at each other
is this a dream
the champagne is poured and gus raises his glass
hazel raises hers
they clink glasses and sip
wow thats good
do you know what dom perignon said after he invented champagne
come quickly he said
i am tasting the stars
hazel and gus smile
welcome to oranjee
would you like a menu or will you have the chefs choice
gus looks at hazel
the chefs choice sounds lovely
the waiter nods and can we get more of this
we have bottled all the stars for you this evening my young friends
the waiter leaves
hazel and gus look at each other
thank you for coming to amsterdam
thank you for letting me hijack your wish
thank you for wearing that dress which is like whoa
hazel shakes her head trying not to smile but unable not to
the waiter brings two more glasses of champagne and a plate belgian white asparagus with a lavender infusion
hazel takes a bite
oh my god
gus takes a bite
that is just
there are no words
meanwhile down on the water a boat passes filled with merry drinking locals
one of them raises a glass to them and says something in dutch
we dont speak dutch
she says the beautiful couple is beautiful
hazel and gus smile
this night could not be going any better so far
cut to later
hazel and gus enjoying their second courses
i want this dragon carrot risotto to become a person so i can take it to vegas and marry it
hazel leans back in her chair in need of a breather
i like your suit
first time wearing it
that isnt the suit you wear to funerals
that ones not nearly this nice
off her look when i first found out i was sick i mean they told me i had like an chance to be cancer free
great odds sure
but that meant a year of torture the loss of my leg and still a chance it might fail
so right before the surgery i asked my parents if i could buy a suit like a really nice suit just in case i didnt make it
its your death suit
thats what it is
i have one of those
bought it for my th birthday
dont think id wear it on a date though
are we on a date
cocks her head watch it
cut to later
dessert on the table
as they euphorically eat
maybe i wouldnt go so far as to say no
id like some evidence
what do you think
oh for sure
i mean not like a heaven where you ride unicorns play harps and live in a mansion made of clouds but yeah i believe in something
hazel is surprised
something becomes of us
it has to
otherwise whats the point
maybe there is no point
i refuse to accept that
i wont accept it
hazel thinks about it
she appreciates his conviction but is still not sure she agrees
the hand theyve been dealt too unfair
hazel looks out at the water as she says i hope youre right
im in love with you
that gets her attention
you heard me
im in love with you
and i know that love is just a shout into the void and that oblivion is inevitable and that were all doomed and that there will come a day when
all our labor has been returned to dust and i know the sun will swallow the only earth well ever have and i am in love with you
shrugs matter of fact sorry
at which point the waiter reappears
hazel is still too speechless to respond her eyes fixed on gus
eventually gus answers for them
just the check please
your meal has been paid for by mr
gus raises his eyebrows at hazel
this van houten guy is something else
hazel and gus on a park bench his arm around her looking out over the water
seeds blow from the elm trees and the reflections of the city ripple in the water below them
hazel leans into his body just a little
they stay like that savoring the best night of both of their lives
cut to a crisp spring morning in amsterdam
the buzz in the air outside is equalled by the buzz in
where hazel excitedly paces through the room
i really dont get that shirt
hazel wears a screen print t shirt of magrittes ceci nest pas une pipe
a painting of a pipe with words below that mean this is not a pipe
van houten will get it
there are like fifty magritte references in imperial affliction
this is not a pipe
but it is a pipe
no its not
its a drawing of a pipe
all representations of a thing are inherently abstract
a drawing of a thing is not the thing itself
nor is a t shirt of a drawing of a thing the thing itself
frannie is still at a loss but shes impressed
when did you get so grown up
i feel like it was yesterday i was telling year old hazel why the sky was blue
you thought i was a genius back then
why is the sky blue
because i say so
a knock on the door
gus pokes his head in
whos ready for some answers
gus and hazel stand outside van houtens white house
im so excited i can barely breathe
as opposed to other days
she playfully hits him
he takes her arm picks up the oxygen tank and up they go towards his front door
as they approach theres a noticeable noise coming from inside the house
its the deep thump of a bass beat
like obnoxiously loud
hazel grabs the brass ornament and knocks
theres no response
maybe he cant hear over the music
gus tries again this time with more force
he tries a third time
finally the music stops
a moment later the door swings open
its a man in pajamas s with a huge potbelly thinning hair and a week old beard
all he says is what
gus and hazel look to one another
could it be
at which point the pajama man slams the door in their faces
hazel and gus are too stunned to react
through the closed door they hear this are they here peter
so it is peter van houten
gus and hazel cant believe it
there are two who the hells they
they are augustus and hazel the young fans with whom youve been corresponding
gus and hazel smile at hearing their names
perhaps this will help things take a turn for the better
you invited them remember
you know why i left america lidewij
to never have to encounter americans
get rid of them
hazel and gus cant believe it
this is terrible
i will not do this peter
at which point the door opens opened by the woman whose voice theyd been hearing van houtens assistant lidewij s dutch pretty in a bookish way
she virtually shoves van houten towards a stunned gus and hazel
and they are again face to face with van houten
one beat two beats
no one knows what to say
finally which of you is augustus waters
gus raises his hand tentatively
van houten sizes them up
without another word he turns and walks inside at least this time leaving the door ajar
i am sorry
hazel and gus share one more awkward glance before gus takes a step
they walk lidewij leads gus and hazel into a living room so sterile its creepy
the walls are empty and white theres a single couch a small ottoman and a single lounge chair
van houten sits in the chair
off to the side are two large black garbage bags full and twist tied
he never opens it
van houten kicks his feet up on the ottoman and crosses his slippers
he motions for them to sit on the couch
yours are the first missives to which ive replied and look where that got me
hazel and gus take their seats
um no thanks
just me then lidewij
scotch and soda
perhaps some breakfast first peter
she thinks i have a drinking problem
i also think the earth is round
nevertheless lidewij pours peter half a glass and hands it to him
he takes a sip then sits up straight
so you like my book
we well augustus he made meeting you his wish so that we could come here and talk to you
van houten says nothing
takes a long pull on his drink
did you dress like her on purpose
looks at her shirt kinda
van houten says nothing to that
i do not have a drinking problem
i have a churchillian relationship with alcohol i can crack jokes and govern england and do anything i want to do
except not drink
he glances over at lidewij who dutifully refills his glass
incidentally thank you for dinner last night
we bought them dinner last night
it was our pleasure
youve come a long way so
what is it i can do for you
we have some questions uh huh
about what happens you know
the end of your book
specifically to those who anna leaves behind
like her mom the dutch tulip man sisy how familiar are you with swedish hip hop
hazel looks at gus
is he kidding
i would say
but presumably you know afasi och filthys seminal album flacken
play bomfalleralla immediately
lidewij sighs but she does as shes told
a few seconds later some loud swedish rap song blasts from the speakers
hazel and gus sit through this totally baffled
yelling over the music im sorry sir
we dont speak swedish
who the hell speaks swedish
the important thing is not what nonsense the voices are saying but what the voices are feeling
the song continues another awkward ten seconds or so before gus has enough
he gets up and turns off the music
are you messing with us
is this some kind of performance
rudolf otto said that if you had not encountered the numinous then his work was not for you
and i say to you my friends if you cannot hear afasi och filthys bravadic response to fearfulness then my work is not for you
hazel is really getting worried at this point
they came all this way for this
when the book ends annas mom raising a hand to silence let us imagine that you are racing a tortoise
hazel and gus fidget in their seats
lidewij frowns clearly feeling bad for them
van houten continues
the tortoise has a ten yard head start
in the time it takes you to run ten yards the tortoise has moved maybe one yard
and so on forever
you are faster than the tortoise but you can never catch him you see you can only decrease his lead
now certainly you can run past the tortoise as long as you dont contemplate the mechanics involved but the question of how turns out to be so complicated that no
one really solved it until cantors proof that some infinities are bigger than other infinities
hazel and gus have no idea how to respond
i assume that answers your questions
i dont know whats going on
and yet you seemed so intelligent in print mr
under his breath must be all that cancer in your brain
gus could throw a punch right now
hazel tries to calm the situation
can we please maybe talk about anna for a sec
i mean i understand that the story ends mid sentence because she dies or she becomes too sick to continue im not interested in talking about that book
but that doesnt mean her family and everyone she loves doesnt have a future right
i said im not interested but you promised
van houten you said you would tell us what happens and thats why were here
i need you tell me
surely youve thought about it
i mean as characters nothing happens to them
they cease to exist the moment the novel is over
this is not what hazel came all this way to hear
she wont accept it
again has to calm i mean i understand
in a literary sense
but its impossible not to imagine some future i cant do this
lidewij get rid of them please
lidewij doesnt move he turns back to hazel i wont indulge your childish whims
i refuse to pity you in the manner in which youre accustomed
i dont want your pity of course you do
like all sick kids your existence depends on it
on a roll you are fated to live out your days as the child you were when diagnosed the child who believes there is life after a novel ends
and we as adults we pity this so we pay for your treatments for your oxygen machines
we give you food and water though you are unlikely to live long enough you are a side effect of an evolutionary process that cares little for individual lives
you are a failed experiment in mutation
lidewij has tears in her eyes
gus has balled his fists
but not hazel
van houtens words have not phased her one bit
she rises from the couch
hey listen douchepants
youre not gonna tell me anything i dont already know about illness
i need one thing and one thing only from you before i walk out of your life and thats for you to tell me what happens to your goddman characters
i cannot tell you
i cannot van houten goes to take a drink but
make something up
hazel smacks it right the fuck out of his hands surprising everyone
after a beat lidewij
ill have a martini please
i have resigned
oh dont be ridiculous
no one moves
van houten realizes hes alone in this
id like you to leave now
youre really not gonna tell us
i would like you
hazel is furious
gus stands next to her touches her arm is if to say come on enough of this guy
cut to gus and hazel come out of the house practically shaking
as they get to the street van houten has one more thing to say
have you ever stopped to ask why you care so much about your silly questions
go fuck yourself
van houten doesnt have a response to that
he just shuts the door
and when he does thats when hazel gets emotional
beat an idea ill write you a sequel
she cries harder i will
better than any shit that drunk could write
with blood and guts and sacrifice
youll love it
hazel nods then wipes away tears
she fakes a smile and gus gives her a hug
afterwards i spent your wish on that asshole
you did not spend it on him
you spent it on us
they embrace once more
apparently the world is not a wish granting factory
this gets a real smile from hazel
thats when lidewij comes outside
clearly shes been crying too
im so sorry
circumstance has made him cruel
i thought meeting you would help him if he would see that his work has shaped real lives but
im very sorry
hazel says nothing
gus holds her in a very protective way
perhaps we can do some sightseeing
have you seen the anne frank house
im not going anywhere with that monster
he is not invited
lidewij walks back from the ticket kiosk with more bad news
im afraid theres no elevator
oh um thats alright
no there are many stairs
i can do it
i can do it
hazel is not going to stand for any more disappointments today
they are going inside
cut to a video plays on a monitor showing the nazi invasion of holland
hazel and gus stand with lidewij in a pack of backpackers and travelers about to take the tour
many of them begin to walk up the first flight of stairs
both hazel and gus walk slowly up the stairs
so far so good
they find themselves in an office space
this is the bookcase that hid the frank family and four others
the bookcase is half open
behind it is an even steeper set of stairs only wide enough for one person at a time
some of the travelers begin to walk up the stairs
gus looks at hazel are you sure we should continue
she begins the climb determined
lidewij trails behind carrying her oxygen tank
hazel moves very slowly
we are aware of her labored breathing the entire time
angle on other tourists watching and quietly commenting
just like at the airport except now in foreign languages
hazel arrives on the next floor an empty room
shes definitely starting to struggle
she leans against the wall to catch her breath
gus comes to her side wipes her brow
youre a champion
when shes feeling up to it they walk into the next room also empty
and another staircase even more narrow and steep practically a ladder
when gus sees this he looks at hazel thats enough im ok
hazel very slowly begins the climb
again were aware of her every breath
and its becoming very difficult
near the top hazel stumbles but is finally able to pull herself through
once there she falls to the floor slumping against the wall trying to catch her breath
gus crouches next to her
were at the top
hazel becomes aware that tourists look at her with concern
she smiles stands up nothing to see here
and now theyre in the final room a long narrow hallway
this is where anne frank and other people lived in hiding for as long as they could
theres a time line detailing their story
the only member of the whole family to survive was otto annes father
gus takes hazels hand
i dont know how you go on without your family
lidewij stays behind to study part of the exhibit
gus leads hazel into the room at the end of the hallway where a video details the last days of anne franks life
over it we hear a young girls voice reading from the diary
the travelers stand to watch and listen
gus and hazel do the same
the room is dark
at such moments i dont think about the misery
gus and hazel stand very closely together
the video is the cherry on top of a very emotional day
hazel watches it
but about the beauty that still remains
gus meanwhile is just watching hazel the same way she watched him on the airplane
after a beat she catches him
their eyes meet
the emotions build
try to recapture the happiness within yourself
think of all the beauty in everything around you
and be happy
and hazel kisses gus
a most passionate intense you and me against the world kind of kiss better than any theyve experienced or could even imagine
it seems to last for a small eternity
eventually they break away and open their eyes
they quickly notice all the travelers staring at them
for a brief second they wonder if that was a very inappropriate thing to do
when suddenly everyone starts clapping for them moved by the whole thing
one european even shouts bravo
hazel blushes gus smiles bows he grabs her hand
cut to they fall onto guss bed kissing
hazel is very in the moment and now its gus who seems nervous
as they kiss its above my knee
she ignores him more kissing
she takes off his shirt
it tapers a little and then its just skin what
hazel pulls away from him
just so youre prepared oh get over yourself
hazel kisses him again
now he tries to pull her shirt off but it gets tangled in with her oxygen tube
he cant figure it out
eventually the whole thing is hilarious to them
they shake their heads laughing certainly not your typical hollywood movie moment
and yet for them i love you augustus waters
i love you too hazel grace
they resume kissing
and we cut to gus wakes up in the bed
he looks around for hazel but she isnt there
on the bed is a piece of paper
it reads dearest augustus
beneath that is a big circle labeled virgins
and in that circle is a smaller second circle labeled year old dudes with one leg
well notice part of that circle is now outside the bigger circle
gus flashes that signature smile
hazel and gus sit with frannie drinking coffee in the sun at an outdoor cafe
theyre re enacting yesterdays events
get up you fat bastard
i cant stand up im too drunk
i said get up
standing is for fools
god what an asshole
they both giggle at the whole thing
it was awful mom
you cant imagine
and then what happened
then we went to the anne frank museum
and after that
a quick glance between hazel and gus
hazel and gus smile thoroughly in love but trying to keep it in check in front of her mother
a few beats later
im gonna stretch my legs a little
give the two of you some time to talk
as she stands up to leave hazel thinks she catches gus and frannie making eye contact for a brief second
once frannie has left them that was weird
gus doesnt respond except to say shall we
they start to walk
gus takes a cigarette out of his pack sticks it between his lips
hazel notices hes struggling with something
theres something i have to tell you
they walk in silence a few beats
just before you went into the hospital
there was this
i felt this
ache in my hip
hazel grabs onto his arm a lump already forming
gus takes the cigarette out of his mouth clenches his teeth tightly trying not to cry
i had a pet scan
gus sits down on a bench
looks up at her
tries to smile
before he even says it she knows
it lit up like a christmas tree hazel
the lining of my chest my liver
oh my god no
hazel loses it in that moment falling on top of him hugging him for dear life her head in his lap
im so sorry augustus
im so so im sorry too its so unfair i should have told you its so fucking unfair
gus still trying not to cry
apparently the world is
not a wish granting factory
and at that point gus lets it go lets himself cry and be sad and feel awful
but just for a second
then he shakes it off pulls hazels face up to his tries again to smile through the tears
dont you worry about me hazel grace
ill find a way to hang around and annoy you for a long time
she hugs him perhaps a little too tightly
does it hurt
but of course its not ok
not by a mile
hazel takes a moment to look at him touches his cheek
im very fond of you
he grabs her hand and holds it
i dont suppose you can forget about it treat me like im not dying
i dont think youre dying augustus
youve just got a touch of cancer
squeezes her hand
would it be absolutely ludicrous to make out right now
hazel doesnt answer
she just kisses him hard
and on the two of them so in love we cut to hazel lays on guss shoulder as he stares out the window leaving amsterdam behind
as they ride down the escalator hazel sees michael standing amongst the livery drivers
he holds a sign that says instead of someones last name my beautiful family and gus
upon seeing them he immediately starts to cry of course
he kisses his wife gives hazel a big hug
gus goes to shake his hand but michael hugs him as well
cut to hazel sits with her father on the couch
gus had a recurrence
waters told us the night before you left
im sorry hazel
they sit for a beat
tears form in michaels eyes
youre not gonna say it
everything happens for a reason
michael shakes his head
i dont know haze
i always thought being an adult meant knowing what you believe
that has not been my experience
hazel understands exactly
gus lays in bed eyes open a picc line now being fed through a port in his chest
chemotherapy at work
hazel and isaac are keeping him company
how are your eyes
i mean theyre not in my head is the only problem
i hate to one up you but
seems my entire body is made out of cancer now so
tries not to get emotional but its happening
he goes to touch guss arm and accidentally touches his thigh
whoa im taken
to hazel re gus did you write his eulogy yet
hazel is confused
i havent asked her
what are you talking about
gus looks at her grows a little serious
i need speakers at my funeral
i thought maybe you and isaac
but especially you hey
would you be kind enough to whip something up
touches his hand it would be an honor
they hold holds
you guys are adorable
hazel play slaps isaac on the arm
hows your love life
anything from monica
not a word
she hasnt even like texted to ask how youre doing
he shakes his head
gus gets an angry look on his face
that is so messed up
ive stopped thinking about it
theres a new girl in support group with these humongous isaac gestures to his chest
hazel is confused
how do you even know that
im blind but im not that blind
they turn to him
do you happen to have four dollars
no one knows what that means
cut to gus is in the passengers seat
isaac sits in the back
hazel returns to the car
with a carton of eggs
ok now what
cut to hazel gus and isaac lean against hazels car staring something down
is it there
oh its there
reveal theyre looking at monicas green firebird
shes in the house
who cares where she is
this is not about her
this is about you
sticks out his hand hazel
hazel nods opens the egg carton hands gus an egg
gus puts it in isaacs hands
positions isaac who of course cant see a thing towards the firebird
isaac winds up and tosses the egg
it misses the car by a mile
after a beat i didnt hear anything
a little to the left
my throw was to the left or i should aim to the left
isaac turns his shoulders
isaac turns some more
and throw hard
gus hands him a second egg
isaac winds up and hurls it missing the car again but hitting the house
no you missed it by like feet
hands him a third try one more time
isaac hurls it this time smashing the cars taillight
isaacs face lights up
isaac grabs for another egg
hes a throwing machine
most of them miss but at least hes enjoying himself
finally theres a direct hit on the car door triggering the alarm
keep throwing keep throwing
gus smiles putting an unlit cigarette in his mouth
hazel watches him enjoying this moment
eventually monicas mom opens the front door and comes out
what in gods name seeing hazel gus and isaac she stops in her tracks
are you monicas mom
your daughter has done an injustice and weve come here seeking revenge
we may not look like much
between the three of us we have five legs four eyes and two and a half working lungs
but we also have two dozen eggs
so if i was you i would go back inside
monicas mom is very confused
without another word she turns and goes back inside
the three of them celebrate
as isaac picks up where he left off hazel gently kisses gus on the cheek
and over we hear a few days later gus landed in the hospital with chest pains
hazel bounds in to find mrs
waters in the waiting room
she stands to hug hazel
they both sit down
hows he doing
hes had a tough night hazel
his blood pressures low
his heart mrs
waters starts to cry
what about the chemo
shakes her head theyre gonna stop the chemo
they both know what that means
waters gathers herself
can i see him
we have to be a family now
well tell him you were here
if you dont mind ill just hang for a while
waters nods hugs her again walks out through the heavy doors towards guss room
hazel sits in the chair
same chair gus sat in while waiting for her
theyve switched places
hazel pushes gus now confined to a wheelchair to their spot on the hill overlooking funky bones
a second picnic this time with champagne
hazel pours some for them both into little winnie the pooh cups
shes trying to be upbeat but its difficult
gus watches the kids play on the bones
what are you thinking about
i know its kids stuff but
i always thought id have a grand story to tell you know
something that would run in all the papers
i always thought i was special
you know what i mean
hazel annoyed finishes her cup tosses it to the side
gus can tell hes said something wrong
i do know what you mean i just
i dont agree
hazel stands up anger building
this obsession with being dont get mad but i am mad
i think youre special is that not enough
you think the only way to live a meaningful life is for everyone to love you for everyone to remember you
well guess what gus this is your life
this is all you get
you get me and your family and this world
and if thats not enough well im sorry but its not nothing
cause ill remember you ill love you youre right and i just wish
i just wish youd be happy with that
pulling her back down im sorry
gus hands hazel another winnie the pooh cup
raises his to hers in a toast
its a good life hazel grace
its not over yet you know
of course it isnt
and yet they both know there isnt much time
cut to hazel is asleep
suddenly her phone buzzes
she looks at it gus then she looks at the clock am
a pit grows in her stomach
a quick panicked beat before she answers hello
oh thank god
hi i love you
im at the gas station
please come help me
hazel drives like a maniac down the street eventually finding herself at the speedway gas station
guss car is alone in the parking lot and she pulls up next to it
she gets out of her car opens his drivers side door and finds him sitting there his shirt stained with vomit and blood
she gags from the smell
hazel looks down at his hands which are pressed tightly to his belly
she sees something is leaking from the tube sticking out of it
oh god augustus im calling
hazel listen to me
do not call or my parents ill never forgive you dont please
gus starts to cry
please just look at it
hazel lifts up his shirt
his abdomen is bright red
i think its infected
hazel feels his forehead hes burning up
gus what the why are you here
why arent you home
gus throws up
he doesnt even have the energy to turn his mouth away from his lap
i wanted to buy some cigarettes
i lost my pack
or they took it
i dont know
they said theyd get me another one but i wanted
to do it myself
do one little thing myself
hazel doesnt know what to do
i cant fix this
i have to call someone
no hazel please
but she must
she gets out her cell phone and dials
at which point gus really loses it weeping like the poisoned dying teenage boy that he is
as hazel dials we hear i wish i could say augustus waters kept his sense of humor till the end did not for a moment waiver in his courage and
his spirit soared like an eagle to the sky
to himself shaking i hate myself i hate myself i hate this i hate this
but that is not what happened
an emt loads gus into the back of an ambulance
hazel is allowed to ride with him in the back
as the car starts moving gus grabs her hand
read me something
read you something
do you know any poems
i know one
read it to me
the red wheelbarrow by william carlos williams
beat tries to remember so much depends upon a red wheel barrow glazed with rain water beside the white chickens
is that it
that is it
but theres another ten minutes of driving to do
hazel thinks fast
no of course not
so much depends upon a blue sky cut open by the branches of the trees
so much depends on the transparent g tube erupting from the belly of the blue lipped boy
gus smiles weakly barely conscious
hazel cradles his head in her arms
so much depends upon this observer of the universe
as gus is drifting off to sleep we hear one of the less bull shitty conventions of the cancer genre is the convention known as the last good day
gus comes home from the hospital
he does not look good but he lives
hazel is there to help get him inside
gus no longer sleeps in his basement
nor does he sleep in his own bed
he sleeps in a hospital bed set up in a guest room
hazel is with him
theyre watching sports on tv
this is where the victim of cancer finds himself unexpectedly with some hours
hazel and gus getting some fresh air
she sits there reading a book
gus just sits there
his eyes staring off into nothing
hazel waves to him
gus looks over as if waking from a dream
she manages a smile
he manages one back
when it seems like the inexorable decline has suddenly plateaued when the pain is for a minute bearable
hazel sits at dinner with her parents
she is barely touching her food
the problem of course is that theres no way of knowing that your last good day is your last good day
at the time its just another decent day
the phone buzzes and hazel answers it
good evening hazel grace
his voice is strong today and hazel is happy to hear it
quick question for you
did you ever write that eulogy i asked you to prepare
i may have
do you think you could find yourself at the literal heart of jesus in minutes
is everything i love you hazel
the call ends
hazel confused stands to go
i gotta go
finish eating first
i cant i have to meet gus
you havent eaten a thing
im not hungry
you cant not eat hazel
i am aggressively unhungry ok
i have to go
hazel listen to your mother
hazel tries to push past her but frannie grabs her shoulders
you have to eat hazel
youre not gonna starve yourself to death just because gus is sick
you have to stay healthy i cant
i cant stay healthy because im not healthy mom
i am dying
i am going to die and leave you here alone and you wont have me to hover around and you wont be a mother anymore and im sorry but i
cant do anything about it ok
just leave me alone
upon seeing her mothers face change hazel immediately regrets this
you heard me
frannie has tears in her eyes
hazel looks away feeling terrible
you heard me say that to your father
frannie sits down on the couch with her daughter
oh god sweetie
i was wrong ok
it wasnt true
its not something i believe
michael sits across from them
as long as either of us is alive i will be your mother
even if you die i when
even when you die i will still be your mother
i will always be your mother
by now michael is crying too
they all are
i worry that you wont have a life
that youll sit around all day with no me to look after and stare at the walls and be miserable or off yourselves or something
were not gonna off ourselves
its gonna hurt like hell to lose you hazel
you of all people know its possible to live with pain
she takes that in
it rings true to her
i dont just sit around you know
hazel is confused
frannie looks at michael like should i say something
she goes for it
im taking some classes
to get my masters in social work
hazel is stunned
so when youre waiting for me outside support group or whatever youre always
working or reading
if i get my msw i can council families in crisis or lead groups dealing with why didnt you tell me
frannie and michael dont quite know what to say
we didnt want you to feel are you kidding
mom this is awesome
this is fantastic
oh my god
hazel grabs her mom for a hug
im so excited
youre gonna be so great mom
that means everything to me
mom and daughter hug
and when its over id still really like you to eat
i know mom
and i will
but right now
i really gotta go
hazel enters the literal heart of jesus room which is now empty except for isaac up on a dais and gus in his wheelchair
gus is thinner than weve ever seen him thinner than any young man should be
but for now hes happy
hazel grace you look ravishing
i know right
so um whats going on guys
late for what exactly
gus gestures for her to sit next to him and she does
i wanted to attend my funeral
by the way will you speak at my funeral
hazel looks at him like of course silly and then kisses him on the mouth
im hopeful ill get to attend as a ghost but just to make sure i thought id well not to put you on the spot but i thought id arrange
a pre funeral
no time like the present
looks around the room how did you even get in here
would you believe they leave the door open at night
as well you shouldnt
he smiles and for a brief moment its old gus
isaac clears his throat
augustus waters was a self aggrandizing bastard
but we forgive him
we forgive him
not because he had a heart as figuratively good as his actual one sucked or because he got years when he should have gotten more
im assuming youve got some time you interrupting bastard
i mean seriously
back to the speech augustus waters talked so much that hed interrupt you at his own funeral
and he was pretentious
sweet jesus that kid never took a piss without pondering the resonances of human waste production
and he was vain
but that comes with superhuman handsomeness
gus nods that part is true
but i will say this when the scientists of the future show up at my house with robot eyes and they tell me to try them on i will tell
the scientists to piss off because i dont even want to see a world without augustus waters
hazel smiles but its one that triggers an immediate emotional waterfall
and then of course having made my rhetorical point i will put my robot eyes on because i mean
gus has a big smile on his face
so anyway augustus my friend
gus nods a couple times
thank you isaac
this causes isaac to lose it
he clings to the lectern
goddamn it gus
hey dont swear in the literal heart of jesus
wipes away the tears
and another beat passes
can i get a hand here hazel
hazel remembers isaac cant see
she rises goes up to get him walks him back to her seat
hazel grace its down to you
hazel takes out a piece of paper walks up to the dais
takes a beat to ready herself
augustus waters was the great star crossed love of my life
ours was an epic love story and i wont be able to get more than a sentence into it without disappearing into a puddle of tears
like all real love stories ours will die with us as it should
id hoped that hed be eulogizing me because theres no one id rather have
and thats all she can get out before falling apart
she lets it out for a couple beats and then pulls herself together
beat composing herself i cant talk about our love story so instead i will talk about math
i am not a mathematician but i know this there are infinite numbers between and
and an infinite collection of others
of course there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between and or between and a million
some infinities are bigger than other infinities
a writer we used to like taught us that
i want more numbers than im likely to get and god i want more numbers for augustus waters than he got
but gus my love i cannot tell you how thankful i am for our little infinity
you gave me a forever within the numbered days and for that i am eternally grateful
i love you
gus smiles nods and closes his eyes
cut to over which we hear a ringing telephone
hazel turns on the light by her bed
her house phone is ringing and its am
she knows instantly
augustus waters died eight days later in the icu
hazels head falls into her chest
when the cancer which was made of him stopped his heart which was also made of him
her bedroom door opens
its frannie and michael
this only confirms her worst fears
she starts to cry
her parents embrace her in the bed
it was unbearable
the whole thing
every second worse than the last
hazel sits in the car in the dark
shes blaring the loudest music she can possibly blare a means of drowning out the horrors of the world
over which we hear this one of the first things they ask you in the er is to rate your pain on a scale from to
id been asked this question hundreds of times and i remember once early on when i couldnt catch my breath and it felt like my chest was on fire and
the nurse asked me to rate the pain and though i couldnt speak i held up fingers
the loud music isnt protecting hazel as well as she hoped
she falls apart nonetheless
later on when id been feeling better the nurse came in and she called me a fighter
you know how i know she said
because you called a ten a nine
hazel puts on her funeral dress
she looks in the mirror
but that wasnt the truth
the reason i called it a nine was
i was saving my ten
the place is filled today with mourners for augustus waters
hazel comes in with her parents and stands in the back watching people shes never seen before approach the waters family and extend their deepest condolences
and this was it
the great and terrible ten
waters see hazel they open their arms
he loved you so much
hugs them back
he loved you so much too
more mourners approach the family leaving hazel stranded in the receiving line
her eyes turn towards the coffin
shes not entirely sure she wants to go there but she takes a deep breath wills herself to walk towards it
gus is there in the same suit he wore to oranjee
immediately hazel breaks down
and immediately she catches herself
its ok you hear me
she leans forward and kisses his cheek
she looks around
once in the clear she pulls out a hard pack of camel lights and sticks them in the space between gus and the lining of the coffin
a minister approaches at that moment
i think were ready to begin
hazel nods and walks back to her parents taking her seat in the middle of the room
augustus waters fought hard for many years
his battle was a courageous one and his strength was a source of inspiration for each and every one of us
this is all such bullshit
and she hears what a load of shit eh kid
hazel recognizes that voice
but it doesnt make sense
she turns around and sure enough its peter van houten
let us pray
everyone clasps their hands closes their eyes
hazel keeps staring at van houten too shocked to do a thing
we need to fake pray now
van houten bows his head
hazel still stunned slowly turns back to the minister trying to make sense of this unexpected appearance
now i call on augustuss close friend isaac to say a few words
isaac stands walks up to the podium with someones help
hazel sneaks one more look at van houten
yup its really him
that makes no sense to her
isaac starts to speak
of all the things ive lost in my life this hurts the most
and isaac stops talking
its unclear if that was the end or if he just cant go on
he returns to his seat
the minister walks back up
and now well hear from guss
special friend hazel lancaster
hazel stands walks up to the podium
a few titters in the room at the words special friend
i was his girlfriend
some laughter from the crowd
she takes out her notes
theres a beautiful quote in guss home that reads if you want the rainbow you gotta deal with the rain
hazel continues to speak but we over it we hear instead i didnt believe a word of course
but that was ok
funerals id decided arent for the dead
theyre for the living
guss parents arm in arm nod along with every word
everyone is watching guss body be lowered into the ground
everyone but hazel
she looks off into the distance
off to the side we see van houten also not watching the burial
hes watching hazel
cut to later
ceremony over we see hazel with her parents
ill be fine
are you sure
we can drive you no id
id like to be alone for a while
hazel hugs mom and dad walks alone towards the parking lot
as she gets to the car van houten approaches
could i hitch a ride
hazel doesnt want to help this man
just to the bottom of the hill
once theyre both in the car how did you even the internet
and you just
bought a ticket
the drinks are free drinks in first class
van houten removes a flask from his coat pocket
takes a swig
hazel shakes her head in disgust
omnis cellula e cellula
hazel ignores him
your boy waters and i corresponded quite a bit in his last you read your fan mail now
i would hardly call him a fan
he despised me
but he was quite insistent i attend his funeral and tell you what became of anna and her mother
so here i am and thats your answer omnis cellula e cellula
im so not in the mood life comes from life
you dont want an explanation
have a great life
you remind me of her
i remind a lot of people of a lot of people
she was eight my daughter
for so long
hazel starts to understand van houten and softens
she had leukemia
just like her yes
were you married then
not when she died no
i was insufferable long before anna my dear
grief doesnt change you hazel it reveals you
hazel takes that in
well im sorry for your loss
and im sorry for yours
im sorry for everything for being so rude to you two for ruining your trip you didnt ruin our trip you asshole
we had an awesome trip
hazel im trying
you asked me to tell you what happens and i wish i could do that
i wish that i could
but i cant
no one can
no one knows hazel
they dont talk to us
van houten takes out a typed piece of paper
he hands it to hazel who grabs it and immediately crumples it into a ball
you think i care about that
i dont give a shit van houten
hazel throws the piece of paper at van houten
youre a drunk and a jerk and a failure
and id like you to get out of my car right now so i can go home and grieve
get out of the car
van houten knows hes too late
he does as hes told stepping out of the car onto the side of the road
he stands there as hazel peels out
in the rearview mirror she sees him raise the flask as if toasting her
she blinks away some tears and drives
cut to hazel lies in front of the tv
top model is playing but shes lost in her own world
tears fall from her eyes and she cant do anything to stop it
hazel gets up
hazel sits against the tub on the floor and weeps
soon theres a knock
can i come in
hazel leans over and unlocks the door
michael kneels down next to her putting her head on his shoulder
hazel presses her face into his shirt and cries some more
michael squeezes her tightly
and this time he doesnt cry
im so so sorry
it was a privilege to love him though wasnt it
hazel nods into his shirt
then looks up at her dad
gives you an idea how we feel about you
michael smiles at hazel
and he doesnt cry
hazel draws strength from him
hazel and isaac have climbed through his open bedroom window
they sit on the roof
do you know if it hurt or whatever
he was really fighting for breath i guess
he eventually went unconscious but it seems like yeah it wasnt great or anything
it just seems so impossible
happens all the time
are you angry
a few beats gus really loved you you know
he wouldnt shut up about it
it was annoying
i didnt find it that annoying
they sit there in silence a few beats
did you read the note or whatever from your author friend
he is not my friend and how do you know about that
we talked at the cemetery
said he came all this way to give you that
yeah well im over it
i never want to read another word of that assholes again
yeah but he didnt write it gus did
thats what he said
gus had written something sent it to van hazel sits up
her heart is racing
i have to go
i do it all the time
as quickly as possible hazel leaves
isaac stays behind enjoying the cool night
a new day is coming
hazel is inside the car rummaging crazily through the trash in an effort to find what van houten gave her
shes about to give up when she sees it crumpled up into a ball beneath the passengers seat
she reaches under pulls it up and unwraps it
as she reads we hear mr
van houten im a good person but a shitty writer
youre a shitty person but a good writer
wed make a good team
i dont want to ask you any favors but if you have the time and from what i saw you have plenty please fix this for me
its a eulogy for hazel
hazel is overcome with emotion
she asked me to write one and im trying i just i could use a little flair
see the thing is
we all want to be remembered
she smiles to herself remembering that first time gus and hazel ran into each other
the staring contest in support group
we all want to leave a mark
driving badly in guss car
their first kiss at the picnic by funky bones
but not hazel
hazel is different
hazel knows the truth
she didnt want a million admirers she just wanted one
and she got it
maybe she wasnt loved widely but she was loved deeply
and isnt that more than most of us get
and back to hazel reading the letter tears in her eyes
when hazel was sick i knew i was dying
but i didnt want to say so
gus stealthily sneaks into hazels single room in the icu
he kneels by her side
she was in icu and i snuck in for ten minutes and sat with her before i got caught
her eyes were closed her lungs were intubated
gus takes her hand and holds it
but her hands were still her hands still warm and the nails painted this dark blue back color and i just held her hands and i willed myself to imagine
a world without us and what a worthless world that would be
and back to hazel reading the letter
she never knew that story never knew he was there
cut to hazel walks out to the grass behind her house the oxygen tank dragging behind her
she lays down on the grass and looks up at the stars the same image that opened the movie
shes so beautiful
you dont get tired of looking at her
you never worry if shes smarter than you cause you know she is
shes funny without ever being mean
the magical dinner at oranjee
the bench in which they sat overlooking the water
the passionate kiss in anne franks house
falling onto the bed together
all of these are images we saw at the beginning of the movie only now we see the oxygen tank we see guss leg we see the fumbling and the
they dont make these images less beautiful
they make them twice as beautiful because theyre real
i love her god i love her
im so lucky to love her van houten
you dont get to choose if you get hurt in this world but you do have a say in who hurts you
and back on hazel in the grass
she holds the letter to her chest
a single tear falls onto her cheeks
i like my choices
i hope she likes hers
hazel closes her eyes
ok hazel grace
hazel opens her eyes
and she says to the universe ok
