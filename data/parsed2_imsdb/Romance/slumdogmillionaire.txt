written by simon beaufoy november th an expensive bathroom suite
excess of marble and gold taps
into the bath a hand is scattering rupee notes
hundreds and hundreds of notes worth hundreds of thousands of rupees
the sound of a fist thumping on the bathroom door furious shouting from the other side
then glimpses of faces
in the half light shadowy figures move with purpose
an implacable voice announces
ten to white out nine eight seven
are you ready
a hand shakes a shoulder a little too roughly
i said are you ready
the thumping at the door continues
the sound of mumbled indian prayer
dull gleam of a pistol
a hand cracks the chamber open
loads a single bullet into the chamber snaps the chamber shut
three two one zero
cue prem cue applause
suddenly the door splinters as it is smashed through
a burst of gun fire and white light as suddenly
we are back in the studio the gun fire morphing into rapturous applause
a wall of light and noise as the two walk on stage
cheering music banks of searing studio lights
on stage jamal an eighteen year old indian boy man stares petrified
he would surely turn and run but for the iron grip on his shoulder of the smiling host prem kumar
welcome to who wants to be a millionaire
please give a warm welcome to our first contestant of the night a local from our very own mumbai
under cover of the wild applause prem ushers jamal towards the guests chair leaning in and hissing
the lights seem to bore into him but jamal manages a tentative smile
out of nowhere a hand slaps him ferociously across the face
then again and again
blood trickles from his mouth
the studio lights have seamlessly transformed into the harsh bulb of an interrogation light
jamal is strung from the ceiling by his arms
your name bhen chod
constable srinivass hand pulls back jamals head by the hair forcing him to stare directly into the lights
and seamlessly we are back
on the set of who wants to be a millionaire
prem leans back in his chair a man at home in his surroundings
jamal sits opposite frozen
so jamal tell us a bit about yourself
close on jamals face
without warning it is shoved under water
we look up from the bottom of the bucket at the screaming face of a drowning man
his head shakes desperately pointlessly
then jamals face is dragged up again roaring for breath
close on his eyes
i work in a call centre
a phone basher
and what type of call centre would this be
so youre the man who rings me up every single day of my life with special offers huh
no actually im an assistant
an assistant phone basher
a raised eye brow at the audience
amusement ruffles through them
and what does an assistant phone basher do exactly
i i get tea for people and
a chi wallah
why didnt you say
laughter in the audience
so ladies and gentlemen jamal malik from mumbai lets play who wants to be a millionaire
jamals body dangles motionless from the ceiling
his head is bowed and he is moaning to himself
the ceiling fan thumps round slowly
in the corner constable srinivas mops his brow and lights a cigarette
the door opens and the inspector of police walks in
a rumpled man in his late forties who has seen pretty much everything
he eyes jamal surprised
has he confessed yet
apart from his name i cant get a word out of the runt
youve been here all bloody night srinivas
what have you been doing
a little electricity will loosen his tongue
constable srinivas brings a box and a tangle of wires out of a cupboard and proceeds to put crocodile clips on jamals fingers
the inspector stares deep in thought
sweat trickles down his face
he wipes it away with a handkerchief seems to be talking to himself
every night i get home why cant we have a c like bajan chacha
why dont you care about your poor family dying in this heat
twenty four years a policeman and i cant afford bloody a c
turns on jamal
youve got ten million rupees ek dum guaranteed yaar
and who knows how much further
fancy the twenty million do you
jamal just stares
i think you probably do
the inspector nods absently to constable srinivas who turns a handle
jamals body pulsates and jerks
his body goes limp again
the inspector goes over to jamal
were you wired up
a mobile or a pager correct
some little hidden gadget
a coughing accomplice in the audience
microchip under the skin huh
constable srinivas hadnt thought of that
grabs jamals arms and starts squeezing them all over until the inspector has had enough
look its hot my wife is giving me hell ive got a desk full of murderers rapists extortionists assorted bum bandits
why dont you save us both a lot of time
jamal doesnt answer
the inspector sighs and sits down
looks at his watch nods at constable srinivas again
jamals body jerks with electric current
when the shudders and screams have subsided the inspector goes over to jamals collapsed form
clicks his fingers in front of jamals face to check for a response
hes unconscious chutiya
what good is that
how many times have i told you
an excited young police constable sticks his head around the door
are wa srinivas well have amnesty international in here next peeing their pants about human rights
get him down tidy him up for gods sake
constable srinivas goes over to jamal and starts to undo the crocodile clips
maybe he did know the answers
have you gone soft srinivas
professors lawyers doctors general knowledge wallahs never get beyond sixteen thousand rupees
and hes on ten million
what the hell can a slum dog possibly know
jamal lifts his head
he lifts his head spits blood out of his mouth and says again straight into the inspectors face
i know the answers
slum dog millionaire
bright sunlight filtered through the ever present mumbai dust
a group of children are playing cricket on a tarmac cricket ground
they are bare foot dressed in little more than rags wiry skinny and fast on their feet
salim a nine year old polishes the ball on his almost non existent shorts comes in with surprising speed and bowls
the batsman hooks it high in the air
the bowler screams at a boy in the outfield
the seven year old jamal stares up at the ball jinks around trying to get into position
he pays no heed to the rest of the children who are scattering fast to the edges of the tarmac
the ball seems suspended in the blue sky
shouts from the other children seem very far away
he doesnt notice that they are screaming for him to get out of the way
jamal adjusts his feet for the perfect catch
then out of nowhere a light aircraft almost takes his head off as it comes in to land on the tarmac runway
jamal is knocked to his feet by the down draft of the plane
the ball bounces away
also flattened salim gets to his feet
how could you drop that
it was a sitter
then salims face turns to one of alarm
at the back of a pack of children carrying a piece of wood crudely fashioned into a sword jamal is running for his life pursued by an ancient but surprisingly
nimble security guard from the airport who is screaming abuse and wielding a long stick
the kids dash across a rubbish dump and disappear down dozens of tiny lanes that run in between the shacks of the slum
private ka land
private ka land
the planes wont kill you mader chod i will
jamal and salim also with a wooden sword break off head down a separate lane
the guard pursues them
the lanes in between the corrugated iron shacks are three feet wide with an open drain running down the middle
many of the precarious upper floors of the shacks have been built right over the paths turning them into black tunnels
tunnels shot through with slivers of light
if you didnt live here you would be lost and frightened in minutes
but these children are natives and with the practice of many years jamal and salim zig zag down the warren of lanes
they dodge past people cooking in the doorways sleeping washing clothes or in the case of vinod a naked four year old pissing into the drain
salim shouts a warning
musketeers coming through
without breaking step they both jump expertly over the stream of piss
not so the security guard who gets it all over his trousers but doesnt stop the pursuit
the two children charge past a shack filled to the roof with chickens in cages who all start squawking
they break out into the sunlight of the main road of the slum lined with shops
it is packed with people stalls bicycles and cows
all modern india is here drinking tea shouting at each other selling food playing carom video games
leaving a trail of shouting and wreckage behind them the pair approach a brand new mercedes almost blocking the lane
beside it stands javed an impressive man in a beautiful suit and his two minders
jamal and salim skid to a stop put their hands together in respectful greeting and edge ever so carefully past the immaculate paintwork of the car
still in pursuit the security guard also slides carefully past the car with deprecating bows and smiles
on past the chi stall where a crowd has gathered to watch a hindi film blaring from the tv rigged up overhead
the irate security guard gets tangled up in a bicycle
jamal and salim stop to give him a taunting hip gyrating parody of the dance on the tv before scooting down another tunnel
they break out into sunlight again
jamal skids to a halt bumping into salim who is already frozen
dont you move a muscle
the security guard arrives and he too skids to a halt at the sight of jamals mother
thank you mister gupta
i will deal with these two
the guard puts his hands together in grudging respect as jamals mother lifts each skinny kid off the floor by their t shirt and marches them down the road
the two renegades are dumped by jamals mother into their desks as mister nandha hands out ancient school books
so the musketeers return
we are honoured
or porthos isnt it
he crashes the heavy book down on his head
salim opens the book
jamal glances over and turns the book the right way round for salim
mister nandha hovers over jamals head
he winces in anticipation
the book comes down like thunder
jamal blinks from the impact and suddenly we are back
in the inspectors office
jamal watches srinivas fiddling with the video recorder trying to get a picture
through the pebbled glass jamal sees shapes moving along the corridor
the commissioner of police is fawning along beside prem as they walk
the young constable hurries behind
it is so kind of you to visit our station sir
a great honour
not at all not at all
i hope you will visit us commissioner
out of his jacket pocket comes a couple of tickets
bring the family
its a lot of fun
a thousand thanks sir
missus janda will be overcome
he turns to the young constable
chi you lazy chutiye chi
the inspector joins them in the corridor
the inspector moves his head
maybe yes maybe no
the commissioner is just able to contain his apoplexy
when prem kumar himself has prem holds up a tolerant hand to the commissioner who falls silent
turns his laser like charm onto the inspector
how good to meet you
clearly the kid cheated
so it is just a question of how no
that is all we need
we are lucky to have a man of your obvious experience on the case
this kid might run rings around us filmi types but he wont make fools out of the mumbai police force i can see that
forced laughter from the commissioner
in front of sixty million people
which is what will happen if we dont get a result gentlemen
he goes back on the show to rob us all with the whole of india watching
i can rely on you
prem walks away down the corridor
stops and turns apparently casual
has he has he made any allegations
hes a cunning one
a convincing liar
dont be taken in inspector dont be taken in
the inspector stares after him
goes back into his office
srinivas has finally got the recorder to work
we get snatches of filmi dancing heroines singing on mountainsides surrounded by implausible numbers of flags cricket and finally after some shouting by the inspector who wants to be a
so mister malik the man who knows the answers
we close in on the tv screen where prem is smiling his crocodile smile and find ourselves
as prem asks the first question
so are you ready for your first question for one thousand rupees
not bad money to sit in a chair and answer a question
better than making the tea no
apka final answer
laughter from the audience
jamal looks confused
prem waves it away switches on his serious face
remember you have three lifelines if youre not sure of your answer ask the audience and phone a friend
so the question the lights go down the portentous music rolls
who was the star of the hit film zanjeer
was it a close on jamals eyes
a tiny shack
a garland of dirty plastic flowers surrounds a torn flyer for one of amitabh bacchans films
salim is sitting on a chair at the end of a rickety wooden pier though it is not water but a sea of rubbish and sewage that lies below them
there are dozens of these piers protruding from the slum onto airport land each with a toilet shack perched right at the end
another man hurries up the pier and hands salim a coin
turns to the toilet door
bhai get out of there
prakash wants a shit
stop your time pass
this is urgent
its a shy one
since when was there a time limit on a crap
since there was a customer waiting thats when
he flashes another placatory smile at prakash
singing grunting come on out you beauty unveil yourself my darling warling
look kid i got a bad stomach
a disturbing combination of heaving and snake charmer noises come from the toilet shack
finally prakash can stand it no longer
im off to devis bog
give me that
he snatches the coin back from salim and hurries off
salim bangs on the toilet door
you just lost me good money you stupid idiot salim stops
in the distance there is the faint sound of shouting a crowd coming closer
then the crowd bursts through the outer shacks of the slum pour onto the rubbish dump and make for the airfield
thats his helicopter
jamal peers through one of the many cracks in the shack
he sees crowds surging around the pier charging towards a landing helicopter
salim shoves the chair under the door handle effectively locking it and runs down the pier to join the chase
jamal pulls up his shorts
rattles the locked door
pulls a torn flyer from his pocket advertising an amitabh movie
he looks down the toilet hole at the sewage beneath him the landing helicopter the disappearing crowd
a final rattle of the door
there is only one way out
he jumps down the hole sprawling headlong into a years worth of human waste managing to keep the flyer out the mire
he runs for the helicopter
salim is at the back of the crowd trying to force a way through but the adults shove him back
not so for jamal
the down draft from the helicopter flicks bits of sewage from his clothes
disgusted fans curse him and get out of his way
suddenly the red sea parts and there is nobody between jamal and amitabh bacchan getting out of the helicopter
jamal holds out his flyer
used to signing autographs the movie star barely looks at jamal
he takes the flyer and scribbles his autograph on it
a thousand thanks amitabh ji
he hands the flyer back to jamal as his bodyguards surround him and hustle him into a car
jamal chases the flyer across the tarmac grabs it
from high up the rickety tin roof tops of the slum seem to stretch to the horizon
there is a distant shout a figure waving an arm
then another shout and another a chain of voices coming closer
people come out of their doorways with pails and buckets
the shouts come closer until we see a naked figure entirely encased in bubbles dancing and singing in the lane
jamal is the happiest boy in the slum
singing amitabh amitabh oh amitabh
i have your autograph oh holy amitabh
here it comes
water comes bubbling through a hose and jamals mother hoses down her ecstatic son
not far away salim wanders to mister chis stall
he glances around to make sure everybody is glued to the hindi film on mister chis tv and surreptitiously slips mister chi the signed flyer
mister chi takes a look and gives salim a small wad of rupees
he sticks the money in his pocket slinks away
a tear stained jamal is furiously trying to batter salim but salims extra strength and height means that he can keep jamal at bay with one hand jamals flailing fists
punching thin air
salims laughter only makes jamal cry harder
close on the tv screen in the inspectors office
prem ponders jamals choice
presses a button on his computer
you chose a amitabh bacchan
you just won one thousand rupees
applause on screen
the inspector looks at jamal
you dont have to be a genius
i knew it was amitabh
like i said
constable srinivas twists jamals arm behind his back evincing a squeal of pain from jamal
squealing hes the most famous man in india
the inspector stares at jamal turns back to the tv where prem is asking the next question
for four thousand rupees
the national emblem of india is a picture of three lions
what is written underneath
a the truth alone triumphs
b lies alone triumph
c fashion alone triumphs
d money alone triumphs
prem shoots a mock puzzled look out to the audience eliciting giggles from them
what do we think jamal
the most famous phrase in our countrys history
maybe you want to phone a friend
laughter from the audience
the studio lights bear down on jamal
a drop of sweat trickles down his forehead
prem is loving his discomfort
or ask the audience
i have a hunch they might just know the answer
what do we think
he gestures expansively at his audience
oh they love him
ask the audience
raises his eyes at the audience
well youre the contestant jamal
put the poor man out of his misery ladies and gentlemen
press your key pad now
the lights dim
the inspector presses pause
my five year old daughter knows the answer to that but you dont
strange for a millionaire genius
your accomplice nip out for a piss did he
or did he just not cough loud enough
constable srinivas kicks jamals chair
the inspector asked you a question
how much is bhelpuri at jeevans stall on chowpatty beach
cant help himself ten rupees
fifteen since divali
who stole constable varmas bicycle outside dadar station last thursday
amused you know who that was
everyone in juhu knows that
even five year olds
despite himself the inspector laughs
then leans in
ill give you five hundred rupees if you just admit it
you go home i go home
jamal just stares back
no you want to go back on the programme and win twenty million rupees dont you
the audience has chosen
and whaddya know
ninety nine percent of them think the answer is a
the truth alone triumphs
what do we think jamal
a hundred percent would have made me a little more reassured maybe
prem shrugs makes a show of examining his computer
suddenly fixes him with his eyes
are you married jamal
well dont despair theres someone out there who thinks our national motto is fashion alone triumphs
you two could be very well matched
the director is shaking his head
what the bloody hell is he playing at
hes way off script
split up with his girl friend
all three i heard
nita as well
back with the wife
shes pregnant again
oh god thats all we need
oh for sharukh khan
stand by white out
won four thousand rupees
music lights applause
one more question before the commercial break
what will our call centre assistant do next
the lights dim
prem presses his computer
for sixteen thousand rupees in depictions of the god ram he is famously holding what in his right hand
is it a a flower
b a scimitar
c a child or d a bow and arrow
right next to the railway lines is a pond of dirty water surrounded by shacks in which dozens of women are washing clothes
trains flash past only feet away from them
down the other end of the pond nine year old jamal and salim are splashing noisily with some other children
jamals mother pauses in her scrubbing wipes sweat from her forehead and gazes up at the leaden sky
its going to come
i can feel it
the woman next to her nods
my head is exploding
we need rain
jamal is trying to intercept the ball that salim and krishna are throwing to each other
hes not having much success
the ball flies overhead again from salim to krishna
jamal dives for it misses and goes underwater
when he comes up for air he shakes his head clearing his ears of water
then he stops listens
shakes his head again
definitely something strange
salim and krishna are trading catches unaware that anything has changed
but jamals mother has heard it too
the faintest sound of shouting roaring
the wave of noise is still faint but getting louder
a frozen moment broken by run
jamal salim run
everybody stares at her
a train speeds through as she continues to shout her words lost beneath the thundering train
the train goes through the last carriage flying past suddenly opening up the sight of a wall of rioting men wielding clubs scythes metal bars
they come screaming across the railway tracks
salim holds out his hand to krishna who is wading with difficulty through the water
youre a bloody muslim
get away from me
the rioters leap the tracks and are upon them
him and him
salim and jamal scramble out and retreat into the lanes
salim turns to see his mother felled by a rioter
she is surrounded by screaming chanting men who rain blows down on her
jamal runs back and drags salim down an alley
as they head down the alley they get glimpses of burning houses fleeing women a three year old boy in a doorway painted entirely in garish blue
he stares at them
in his hand he is carrying a bow and arrow
an eleven year old girl dressed only in a pair of pants runs after them
she has two bleeding red gashes on her back
they turn a corner and head towards some vans full of police
jamal sees mister nandha the school teacher stops
then mister nandha starts walking towards him
an oasis of calm in the chaos
jamal looks at him with relief
mister nandha smiles walks towards them
ram nam satya hai babri masjid dhvasth hai
we have destroyed your mosque
now the followers of ram will drive you dogs out of our city
from behind his back he produces a knife and runs towards jamal screaming
ram has returned to his temple
ram has returned
they flee but jamal turns sees the girl frozen
he chases back a few steps hauls her arm
the spell broken and they are off
they reach the safety of the police vans
but inside the vans the police are smoking laughing playing cards
down the street a man comes whirling out of a doorway his hair on fire
he falls into the middle of the street and is engulfed by rioters
unperturbed the police continue to chat
salim and jamal look on horrified
then one of the police men turns looks at them
motions to a colleague
puts out his cigarette with purpose
lets go bhai
salim and jamal run
the girl follows
salim and jamal stand on a hill overlooking the city
black smoke billows from a large area that is clearly the juhu slum
standing a little way off is the girl
we should go back
see if ama salim shakes his head fiercely silencing jamal for a moment
but only a moment
what about jeevan chacha
salim shakes his head
maybe he salim shakes his head again
i saw him
he was with them
but he wouldnt hurt he was with them
but shut up jamal cant you
just shut up
salim turns away and sees the girl
picks up a rock and hurls it at her
she dodges takes a couple of steps back but makes no real attempt to get away
he finds another rock and hurls this in her direction too
then a flash of lightning and thunder rumbles across the city
rain begins to come down
what shall we do
jamal sits down
salim sits down
at a distance the girl sits down
rain pours down their faces
rain as youve never seen
a pile of huge water pipes in a sprawling builders yard
jamal is in one pipe salim above him in another
they are both soaked shivering but have found some plastic sheet to wrap themselves in
outside thirty feet away stands the girl
salim hisses angrily at the girl
the girl might not even have heard
shell have the security guard onto us standing there
not if we let her in
she could be the third musketeer
i am the head of this family now
and i say no
piss off you
salim huddles down in the pipe
after a while jamal follows suit
we dont even know what the third musketeers called
a flash of jamals mother being clubbed to the ground
jamal wakes with a jolt and a scream half swallowed in his mouth
he shuts his eyes tight trying to force the image out
his breathing slows and he sees the girl staring at him
salim too is staring into nothing
the rain is still falling
the girl goes back to drawing shapes in the mud with her finger
jamal climbs out of the pipe
looks at salim for permission or refusal but he just continues to stare
so jamal walks across to her
she looks up wary
wheres your mother
the girl shakes her head slightly
jamal takes the plastic sheet from around his shoulders
gives it to her
jamal goes back to his water pipe climbs in
watches her huddled under the sheet
sighs motions for her to join him
she darts across jumps into the water pipe and huddles up next to jamal
jamal looks at the inspector
i wake up every morning wishing i didnt know the answer to that question
if it wasnt for ram and allah i would still have a mother
d a bow and arrow
prem stares at him for dramatic effect
presses his computer
computer ji d lock kiya jaye
the lights dim the music swells
jamal malik you answered d
ram is depicted with a bow and arrow in his hand
and guess what
youve just won sixteen thousand rupees
well done my friend
time for a commercial break dont go away now
prem switches off his professional smile
got lucky huh
id take the money
youll never get the next one
youre from the juhu slum arent you
know where i live now kid
twelve bedrooms a c in every room two kitchens a gym and a screening room
steel balls is what it takes my friend steel balls
the floor manager comes over and gives his head phones set to prem
tone it down for goodness sake
youre making him a laughing stock
prem glances up at the gallery with contempt
were having fun here
they love it
where the hell do you get them from
he makes no attempt to hide the conversation from jamal
its supposed to be a quiz show not a blood sport
stop wetting your pants
ill be a good little boy with the next one
he chucks the head phones back at the floor manager
glances in the wings
sees nita the make up woman
gets up and goes over
in the half light backstage nita dabs his face with powder
meet me after the show
nita i can explain
i read it in bloody stardust
didnt even have the balls to tell me
prems happiness with another baby on the way
after everything you said
baby it all happened before i met you
i swear to you
shes got the gestation period of an elephant then
prem is about to object
but instead he laughs
amidst all this misery only you can make me laugh
scornful but hints of melting
all this misery
her and i nothing
you have to believe me baby
nita turns away
the floor manager comes over
prem slings himself in a chair
im not going on
without you its all pointless
clicks his fingers at the floor manager
tell the director
nita shakes her head at the floor manager who by now is looking very worried
prem shrugs and folds his arms
sees her weaken
calypso bar private room just you and me
he grins jumps up blows her a kiss and stalks back on stage
he sits back down says almost to himself
turns to jamal
okay juhu boy youve had a good run
take your mother to khandala and eat some chiki
my mothers dead
well your girlfriend then
i dont have a girl friend
live wire like you
you surprise me
the warm up man starts the applause
three two one
cheering and music
prem switches on his charm
welcome back to who wants to be a millionaire
our contestant jamal malik call centre assistant from mumbai is on sixteen thousand rupees and has already used one lifeline ask the audience
so my friend are you ready for the next question
then lets play
the lights dim
for sixty four thousand rupees
the british architect frederick stevens designed which famous building in india
is it a the taj mahal
b chhatrapati shivaji terminus
c india gate
d howrah bridge
what do you think jamal
are you one of those tea boys with a penchant for architecture
known to everyone as vt station this monument to victorian railway architecture is a dangerous place to be at rush hour
even before the train has stopped men are jumping from the open doors or vaulting out of the windows or from the roof of the train to join the tens
of thousands of mumbaites streaming to and from work
a seventeen year old jamal squeezes himself out of a train and shoves through the crowds
he checks the time
the digital numerals flick to five oclock
looks around the tide of humanity
so whats it to be
walk away and this cheque for sixteen thousand rupees is yours
look its even got your name on it
he produces a cheque and waves it at jamal
i dont have a bank account
laughter from the audience
prem is momentarily wrong footed
but ill take cash
more laughter this time with jamal rather than at him
prem gets up and starts rummaging theatrically through his jacket pockets and trousers
looks like the producers stolen my wallet again ill play
nobody was expecting this
least of all prem who has to rearrange his features into one of surprised delight
he sits down
well well well
weve got a wild one here
prem tears up the cheque with theatrical slowness
for sixty four thousand rupees ladies and gentlemen the question once again
the digital clocks show five fifteen
shoving the descending river of people out of his way the eighteen year old jamal is forging a path up steps that cross the platforms
he pushes to the middle of the footbridge and leans out on the side railings
he scans the sea of people desperately
then he sees her the eighteen year old latika heart stoppingly beautiful over the other side of the station
a world away
she is scanning the crowd as wired as he is
but though he is screaming her name his voice is swallowed by the noise around him
then he sees two thuggish looking men also fighting a way towards her
frightened now he fights his way down the steps one figure against an army of white robed people
chhatrapati shivaji terminus
chhatrapati shivaji terminus
i think so
you think so
a brave man ladies and gentlemen a brave man
the commuters have mostly gone
jamal is pacing the platform desperately
he stops stares blankly at the statue in front of him a proud rather pompous figure in a victorian frock coat
the plaque reads frederick stevens
the inspector srinivas and jamal are staring at the video recorder
chhatrapati shivaji terminus
is the right answer
sixty four thousand rupees to you sir
applause and music
the inspector presses pause
stares at jamal
and did she come back
jamal smiles sadly
i wouldnt be here if she had
pretty was she
jamal stares down at his feet
right in the eyes
the most beautiful woman in the world
constable srinivas snorts
suddenly jamal is out of his chair and at srinivas throat
the combined force of the inspector and srinivas force him roughly back down
he is again handcuffed to the chair
the slum dog barks
money or women
the reason for most mistakes in life
looks like you got mixed up with both
srinivas you need the exercise a trip to vt station to check on the statue
and lock your bloody bike up
constable srinivas swears under his breath but bumbles out
thats the chutiye out the way
now man to man
how did you know all the answers
if i knew id tell you
now were into the serious money
for two hundred and fifty thousand rupees ladies and gentlemen a quarter of a million rupees
the song chalo ri murali was written by which famous indian poet
was it a surdas
c mira bai
remember you still have two lifelines fifty fifty and phone a friend
tempted to use one
i know this one
an expert on the poets huh
the lights dim the music swells and prem presses his computer
jamal is studying a piece of paper and reading out numbers from it
there is something not quite right about jamal perhaps the fact that there are two feet by his ears
salim is standing on his shoulders and spraying the numbers on a wall with an aerosol and a certain lack of confidence
four nine zero nine the one with the stick going down salim six stick going up latikas head appears from around the corner
but they dont hear
then she is running for her life past the pair of them
six one shit lets go salim collapses off jamals shoulders and all three run off down an alley past a dozen of the gangs sprayed on adverts all reading beanbags
a fat security guard with a long stick huffs round the corner
chases them up an alley
nowhere to go except through an imposing gate that clearly leads to a private house
got you now little shits
they charge across the lawn down one side of the house where all the washing is hanging
the guard gets caught up in drying sheets towels
he fights his way through to see salim latika and jamal leaping over the wall to safety
but jamal turns jumps back and grabs a girls dress from the line
the security guard lands a couple of blows on jamals back as he dodges around him and back across the lawn dress in hand
the security guard gives up
jamal is examing the bruises on his legs
useless bloody look out
what good is she huh
infuriated i tried to warn you
its okay salim
latika slips on the dress
both of them look up
she pulls her hair back smiles is transformed into a beautiful girl
diggers and trucks are shifting mounds of rubble on a rubbish dump that seems to stretch for ever
oblivious to the dust kicked up by the trucks latika is picking up old plastic bags examining each one and putting the less worn in a big sack
the dress is recognisable but dusty and torn
she stoops to dig another bag out of the dirt but stops and stares
shimmering in the heat a rickety pick up truck comes through the rubbish dump gates
toots at the guard who waves pulls up in the dump
hope orphanage is written on the side of the van
a man gets out
under sheets of plastic propped up on sticks jamal and salim are sleeping out the hottest part of the day
jamal wakes to see a figure standing over him a silhouette with a halo of sun behind him
out of his bag the man produces a bottle of thumbs up
he uncaps it with an alluring hiss
it is almost an advert for thirst quenching affluence
almost instinctively salim and jamal stir
he hands the bottle to salim gets another from his bag and waves it questioningly at jamal
my name is maman
the hills on the edge of bombay
greenery and space for the first time in the film
the pick up truck pulls up outside a building with jamal salim and latika sitting on a bench in the back
maman gets out
drops the gate on the back of the pick up
come on in
twenty children are eating at long benches in a ramshackle courtyard
maman ushers jamal salim and latika in and sits them down at one of the benches
he waves a hand and a giant man punnoose comes over with a big bowl of food
the three tear into it
cleaning every last morsel of rice from his plate jamal looks up and notices a table peopled entirely with blind or crippled children
some of the legless are eating on the floor next to the table
jamal leans over to salim
he must be a very good man to look after these people
glancing at them a saint
arvind a boy smaller than either jamal or salim overhears
were not allowed to talk to them
latika licks her plate glances at maman who is looking right at them
well if there are seconds maman is definitely a saint
as if telepathic maman signals to punnoose and he brings a large bowl of rice and dhal over to them
latika looks at jamal and salim
they burst out laughing
i tell you lord siva is with us
salim latika jamal and a group of children are standing in a line singing a doha ancient lyrics set to music
maman is leading the singing walking up and down the line listening to each one individually
he stops at one small boy arvind and listens
nods his head pleased and continues down the line until he stops in front of jamal
holds up his hand
jamal starts singing again
he has the sweetest of voices
untrained but pure
maman smiles ruffles jamals hair impressed
they all join in
maman continues down the line
he stops at salim whose octave slipping singing is lusty and appallingly out of tune
maman winces and moves on
standing next to salim latika giggles
immediately salim is on her
before a fight breaks out punnoose pulls salim off latika and hurls him across the room
salim gets up and charges at punnoose
for a second punnoose is back footed but then pins salims arms to his side
you sing like one and you fight like one
i think youve found your dog punnoose
a group of children are sitting in the jumble of concrete under a motorway flyover
cars surround them bumper to bumper
latika and jamal are playing an improvised hopscotch on concrete slabs
they are giggling bumping into each other tickling laughing
salim and punnoose are sitting together smoking
salim is staring hard at jamal and latika until punnoose grunts a sign for salim to clap his hands
okay lets go lets go
its not a bloody holiday
the children get to their feet
latika sighs puts a patch over her eye and grabs a pair of crutches
suddenly the lame beggar
salim goes over to one of the girls who is carrying a sleeping baby
puts out his hand
give me that
the girl shakes her head
salim grabs her by the hair in one hand and takes the baby with the other
he shoves her to the ground
the other children stare
he challenges jamal
what chote bhai
you got a problem
he laughs and walks over to latika
i dont want it
youll earn double
im doing you a favour latika
she doesnt want it
latika turns away and begins to walk towards the cars
ill drop it
he holds the baby up
latika grabs the baby with a cry just as salim releases it from his hands
salim pinches the baby
triple if its crying
latika snatches it away
salim laughs goes back to sitting with punnoose
the children scatter to the cars trapped at the lights tapping plaintively on the windows and making the universal begging gesture
surrounded by beer bottles punnoose is slumped asleep by the kitchen door
latika edges past avoids the cook sleeping under the table and goes to a shelf laden with vegetables
she pulls down a bunch of chillies still on the vine strips a few off and tip toes out with them
sleeping children three or four to a mattress on the floor
latika tip toes around the mattresses
she pauses over one in particular where we see salim asleep
she carefully pulls up the sheet delves underneath
pleasant dreams cross salims sleeping face for a second
then suddenly he is bolt upright and screaming
he charges around the room clutching his genitals in agony
he sprints out of the room wailing
the lights are on and two dozen children are screaming with laughter as salim stands under the make shift shower directing the water down his pants to his burning genitals
his face a picture of agony
latika wipes crushed chillies from her hands
youre dead sala
she smiles and walks past jamal with a shrug
then punnoose comes stalking in and the children scatter away
get back to bed dogs
what the hell
they taught me every song in the history of indian music
and why would they do that i wonder
in a shack arvind is singing one of surdas bhajans in front of maman and an old man who by his ragged appearance must be a villager
punnoose and salim sit behind arvind
very good very good
i am pleased arvind
he is ready
maman nods to punnoose
before arvind can turn round punnoose has covered his mouth with a cloth and after the briefest of struggles arvinds body goes limp
the villager puts an old tin box on the table
taking the lid from the tin he brings out a cloth and unwraps it
inside is a spoon
he checks the edge with his thumb
douses it with a clear liquid from a bottle and passes it over a candle flame
the spoon whooshes with a high flame for a moment
the villager wipes it with the cloth nods to punnoose
utterly bemused salim nevertheless helps punnoose lay arvind on the table
the villager takes hold of arvinds eyelid and pulls it open
he brings the spoon close
suddenly salim is being sick in the corner of the shack
by the time he has turned back the villager is wiping the spoon on a blood soaked rag
take him out the back
punnoose picks up arvind and carries him out
now the other one
salim go get jamal
a frozen moment
gunfighter number one isnt that right salim
the money the women the cars
you want them bad huh
and why not
maman gets out of his chair
the time has come to choose yaar
the life of a slum dog or the life of a man
a real man
a gunfighter salim
maman holds salims head in his hands
your destiny is in your hands bhai
you can be me
so brother go get jamal
salim is frozen for another few seconds then turns and walks out of the door
punnoose appears at the door
maman nods to him and he slips off after salim
all the children are asleep apart from jamal who is crouched underneath a couple of wash basins
he is talking through a plate sized hole in the crumbling masonry
latikas eyes can be seen
weddings government things big parties
if maman says my voice is ready
enough for a room
maybe an apartment
thats what arvind said
on harbour road
you me and salim
the three musketeers
we can have ice cream from babanjis
every day if we want
salim appears at the door
nods his head at jamal
its my turn
good luck jamal
latikas hand comes through the gap
jamal takes it for a moment
salim hisses at jamal
he lets go of the hand and heads out
salim and jamal walk along the path jamal humming happily
salim checks behind him sees punnoose following
so this is it hey bhai
the good life here we come
jamal is suddenly alert
puts a hand on jamals shoulder
when i say
salim guides jamal into the shack where maman and the villager are waiting
punnoose slips in behind salim
you have done well
its time for you to turn professional
sing me a song yaar
how about chalo ri murali huh
jamal opens his mouth then closes it again
holds out his hand
shrugs ive turned professional
what can i do
he throws some notes at him
outside a giggle
latika is peering through a gap in the wall
jamal begins to sing
maman waits a while then nods to punnoose
behind jamal punnoose hands salim the bottle of chloroform and the rag
salim approaches the back of jamal
salim waits until he has finished the song
raises his hand with the rag in it
maman smiles nods
salim flings the contents of the bottle in punnooses face
punnoose screams and stumbles back clutching his eyes knocking over the table
salim and jamal scramble for the door
the knocked over candle catches the spilled chloroform and a curtain which whooshes up in flame
they charge past the prone arvind a flash of bloodied bandages covering his eyes
heavy desperate breathing
feet stumble on roots
fall into holes
the three children are running
branches smack into their faces
but they are so scared nothing will stop them
behind them torches scour the undergrowth
they break out of the woods and are confronted with a train goods yard
they run over the tracks between the trains but the shouts are getting louder the torches closer
a diesel engine is moving out of the station
jamal latika and salim sprint for the guards van at the very back of the moving train
punnoose is closest to them
salim is fastest and first to jump the train
he holds out his hand
jamal grabs it and is hauled in
jamal holds his hand out to latika
she reaches out to him
their hands almost touch
i cant reach
salim barges jamal out of the way
jamal stumbles back as salim reaches his hand out to latika so he doesnt see latikas hand grasp salims nor see their eyes lock onto each other nor see salim
very deliberately let go of her hand
jamal scrambles to the rail
the train gains more speed
jamal climbs on to the top rung makes to jump but salim flings him backward
jamal tries to scramble to his feet again but salim restrains him
got to go back
weve got to go back
hell kill us if we go back
he was going to take your eyes out with a bloody spoon
the train is speeding along
jamal breaks free and stares back at latika
shell be alright
she always is
latika stumbles again and stops running
they watch as punnoose catches up with her and stops running
he smashes latika to the ground
the question was for two hundred and fifty thousand rupees who wrote the famous song chalo ri murali
i should warn you jamal from this question on if you get the answer wrong you lose everything
are you sure
the life lines are there
apka final jawab
computer ji a lock kiya jaye
the lights dim the music swells
prem presses a button on his computer looks him straight in the eyes for an age
simply guess what
applause music lights
the inspector is eying jamal weighing it all up
shrugging blind singers earn double
you know that
and what happened to the girl
they blinded her too
shakes his head they had other plans
though it took me a long long time to find out
salim and jamal are sitting on top of the train
jamal is staring blankly down the track
salim puts an arm around jamals shoulder
jamal wipes the tears from his eyes shakes his head furiously
salim gets up
holds out his hand
where you going
first class bhai
the ancient train is huffing slowly up an incline
a middle class indian couple with their three children are sitting at a table their breakfast spread before them
into this domestic scene unseen by them comes jamal
upside down and still outside the train he is clearly being dangled by his ankles from the train roof
he gives a few silent directional signs to salim who manoeuvres him across dips his hand into the open window snatches a chapatti and signals franticly to be hoisted up
the family continue to eat unperturbed
then jamal appears again
this time one of the children spots him
despite jamal giving her a friendly wave she yelps
the father of the group grabs jamals hand which has just snatched a samosa
there is a tussle salim holding onto jamals legs the father holding onto jamals arms and jamal in the middle shouting
salim is losing the battle and his footing
he stumbles and the pair of them fall from the train rolling and tumbling down an embankment in slow motion
interspersed with the seemingly endless tumble are images of jamal and salim on top of different trains huddled together against the freezing rain
surfing the wind at the front of the train
admiring the distant himalaya
we criss crossed the country from rajasthan to calcutta
every time we were thrown off we got back on again
this was our home for years
a home with wheels and a whistle
the final tumble as they crash onto flat ground
groggily jamal sits up and groans
somehow in the tumble he has been transformed into a twelve year old
and salim a strong fourteen year old
through the haze of pain and dust jamal sees something glinting in the distance something impossibly beautiful
is this heaven
youre not dead jamal
jamal clears his head
sees salim picking himself up from the ground
but the apparition is still there
so whats that
they stare at the apparition
the unmistakable outline of the taj mahal rises from the horizon pink in the morning sun
nothing could be more beautiful
some hotel huh
jamal and salim wander under the great dome of the taj mahal
two tiny slum kids dwarfed by this massive monument to love
it is a moment of genuine wonderment for them
then a tour guide bustles nearby tourists flowing behind him
there are five main elements to the taj
the darwaza the main gateway the bageecha or garden the masjid or mosque the naqqar khana the rest house and the rauza or mausoleum
if you would like to follow me i will show you the ninety nine names of allah on mumtazs tomb
as before please remove your shoes
jamal follows the guide and his entourage into the mausoleum
salim meanwhile is studying the line of shoes
tries a smart pair of womens court shoes before slipping a foot into a nice white sneaker
a smile crosses his face
his other foot quickly follows and he saunters away all mock innocence
jamal comes out of the mausoleum into the bright sunlight and looks around for salim
no sign of him
suddenly a german couple approach
please what time is the next tour
err so much waiting around in this damned country
jamal notices that he is standing next to a sign advertising guided tours of the taj
no i were on a very tight schedule you see young man
have to see the red fort this afternoon
would it be possible to show us around now
obviously we understand it would cost more for just the two of us
peter waves a couple of thousand rupee notes at jamal
his eyes widen
but of course madam
please follow me
jamal stalks off
the germans follow
jamal stops before the monument
points a confident arm at it
the taj mahal
a terrible pause as peter and ada stare at him
clearly more is expected
he moves off at a pace
the taj mahal was built by the emperor khurram for his wife mumtaz who was maximum beautiful woman in the whole world
when she died the emperor decided to build this five star hotel for everyone who wanted to visit her tomb
but he died in in fifteen eighty seven before any of the rooms were built
or the lifts
the swimming pool however as you can see was completed on schedule in top class fashion
he waves confidently in the direction of the fountains
it says nothing of this in the guide book
with respect madam the guide book is written by a bunch of lazy good for nothing indian beggars
and this lady and gentleman is burial place of mumtaz
how did she die
a road traffic accident
maximum pile up
suspicious i thought she died in child birth
nodding sagely exactly sir
she was on the way to the hospital when it happened
jamal moves on
ada and peter exchange a glance
shrugging youve seen the way they drive around here
montage of jamal authoritatively showing tourists around the taj mahal
it was the best paid job ive ever had
this is the princess diana seat madam
jamal shows the tourist a battered postcard of princess diana staring doe eyed into the distance with the taj behind
the tourist sits
jamal adjusts her legs so that they match the postcard
takes the photo
and abandons the woman with a polite bow charging for safety as two police officers race towards him
jamal stands a tourist on a wall and positions his hands to create the optical illusion that he is dangling the taj from his fingers
takes a photo for the tourist
behind the tourist salim and a boy called shankar pick up the tourists shoes and saunter casually across the grass
by the side of a busy market street salim stands next to a row of stolen shoes
sneakers court shoes sandals high heels
he is busy bartering with a man over a pair whilst jamal tries to shout up business
top class fashion bottom class prices
shoes for all
shoes for all
hectares of drying clothes by the side of the river
spectacular squares of red saffron white
not far away from the dhobi ghat there is a makeshift slum camp where salim and a gang of children are sitting smoking
jamal joins them hands over a wad of rupees to salim
salim counts the cash hands half to shankar and slaps jamal so hard on the back that he nearly falls over
and life was good
jamal gets out of a new mercedes driven by an indian man
a middle aged american couple also get out
jamal points them down a lane which opens out on indias largest dhobi where hundreds of women are beating clothes on stone slabs
this is the biggest dhobi ghat in the whole of india mister david
they say that every man in uttar pradesh is wearing a kurta that has been washed here at least one time
is that so
lets get a look at this adele
he gets out his video camera and wanders towards the dhobi ghat
behind them a motor rickshaw pulls up
salim shankar and a couple of the street kids from the taj leap out
within seconds the mercedes is up on bricks and the wheels are being removed
salim takes a hacksaw to the mercedes badge on the bonnet whilst urging the others on
formula one formula one
pit stop ka speed schumacher ka ishtyle the crowds in the lane barely notice as the car is stripped of all its parts
a shout from the top of the lane and the boys scatter bouncing the four wheels at speed down the lane
jamal the indian driver and the two americans return
they stop in front of the denuded car
what happened here
suddenly the indian driver is slapping jamal ferociously around the head with one of his shoes
i give you two tight slaps mader chod
i dont know
i didnt do it did i
nothing to do with me
but the beating continues the driver kicking jamal down onto the floor
the two americans stare uncertain what to do
do something clark
well i i dunno i finally clark intervenes pulling the driver off jamal
okay okay just cool it
youre insured arent you
jamal sits up
he is bleeding from his nose and mouth
you wanted to see the real india mister david
here it is
well heres a bit of the real america too son
adele pulls out his wallet and rummages for dollars
a battered jamal limps along the river bank towards the taj
he stops bathes his swollen face in the river
then looks up
strange lights appear to emanate from the base of the monument
and then strange sounds
jamal climbs a crumbling wall and is confronted with an opera taking place right under the dome
glucks orfeo ed euridice
hundreds of indias smartest professionals are watching from banked seating on a scaffolding frame
jamal and a couple of street kids slip under the scaffolding supporting the banked seats
the street kids are trying to reach the hand bags of the women above them
hissing oi jamal
theres a woman with no panties on over here
jamal reaches up and easily lifts a wallet from a mans trouser pocket
on stage the actors start singing
jamal seems to have forgotten the wallet and stares mesmerised at the stage
why dont you put it back and listen to the music
jamal starts makes to run but the woman who spoke holds out a cigarette
a canadian back packer is sitting staring at the singers
its called orfeo
orpheus and eurydice
orpheus that one there is looking for his lover eurydice
she died but he cant live without her
she hands him a cigarette
he puts the wallet back
she smiles at him and they both turn to the stage
the pain is so bad that he goes to the underworld the place we go when we die to try to get her back
you cant do that
shrugging you can in opera
does he find her
watch and see
jamal watches as orpheus sings one of the most beautiful pieces of music a human is likely to hear
tears are running down jamals cheeks
salim shankar jamal and the taj gang are gathered around a campfire
all of them wear extraordinary foot wear of one form or another from elaborate high heels to walking boots five sizes too large
a home made hooka pipe is being passed around the fire
the eyes of the children have long since stopped focussing
salim is sporting a mercedes benz badge on a chain around his neck
behind him jamal appears his face swollen
he takes off his fake guides badge and throws it in the fire
what are you jamal
we have to go salim
dont be stupid
were making good money here
we should have gone a long time ago
salim turns to shankar with sudden understanding
baby brothers in love
with a flat chested hijra
latika was one of us
grow up jamal
look how was i to know theyd beat you up
here you can have some of the cash
ive got cash
he rips out a wad of dollar bills from his pocket
im getting my stuff
he walks off
he gets up kicks the fire in rage and stomps after jamal
prem leans back in his chair
so my friend ready for another question
prem presses his computer
the lights dim again the music comes up
for a straight one million rupees ladies and gentlemen
on an american one hundred dollar bill there is a portrait of which american statesman
is it a george washington b franklin roosevelt c benjamin franklin d abraham lincoln
silence from jamal
pay or play jamal
all you have to do is stop now and you walk away with a cool quarter of a million rupees
decide to play get the answer wrong and you walk away with absolutely nothing
but get the answer right and you win a million rupees
pay or play
a long pause
okay he hasnt got a clue

the minimum tip for my services
laughter from the audience
now i know why my cell phone bill is so high

a gasp from the audience
prem is caught off guard
we havent locked the computer man
youre going to play
i think i just have
you certainly have
not confusing your franklins
benjamin for roosevelt
ive never heard of roosevelt franklin
theres a million rupees at stake and hes never heard of roosevelt franklin
i cant bear to look
he gives this one to the audience who titter on cue
jamal looks confused
dont you worry jamal
you were asked which statesman is depicted on a hundred dollar bill
you said c
ladies and gentlemen
he presses the computer pretends to ruminate for a while with his finger pressed to his lips
jamal malik you chose to play not pay
im afraid you no longer have two hundred and fifty thousand rupees
prem leans over and tears up the cheque
there is a sigh of disappointment from the audience a look of confusion on jamals face
you in fact have one million rupees
wild applause from the audience
jamal allows himself a genuine smile
the inspector pulls out a note from his wallet
glances at it
whos on the thousand rupee note
i dont know
he waves the note at him
ive heard of him
the inspector kicks his chair
dont get clever or ill get the electricity out again
they didnt ask me that question
i dont know why
the inspector stares hard at jamal
funny you dont seem that interested in money
then constable srinivas stomps back into the office sweat pouring from him
platform seventeen has to consult his notebook
a statue of frederick stevens architect and builder of victoria terminus in yes yes srinivas
the hundred dollar bill
from a thousand feet in the sky looking down on the limitless megatropolis of mumbai
half built sky scrapers slums factories roads trains
bombay had turned into mumbai
we descend down until the lines of ants become people
the orphanage had gone the slum had gone the people
and everywhere was building building building
descending even further we pick out a construction site and then jamal
who is staring through a wire fence at the construction site
but i knew she was here
somewhere she was here
he turns away then something catches his eye
underneath all the scraps of flyers and posters on a broken wall is a corner of something that jamal recognises
he tears back a poster
underneath faded but recognisable is one of their beanbag graffiti advertisements
jamal asks a group of stall holders on the slum main street
they shrug arent interested
the camera pulls up and up until jamal is nothing but a dot wandering the maze of lanes railways and highways one among endless millions of people
evenings i searched
days i worked
jamal wanders up to the rickshaw drivers parked outside the hotel
he stops and asks a question
the drivers shake their heads
jamal continues up the steps towards a door exhausted face and grubby clothes walking straight towards camera
he goes through the door and immediately
is without breaking step in a slightly grubby white uniform
he walks across the echoing marble floor of a struggling four star hotel goes through double doors
into a corridor that is devoid of carpet paint anything except a phone on the bare wall and a stool
the phone is ringing
jamal sits on the stool and answers the phone
room service good afternoon
two chicken burgers two fries one cocoa cola and one mango lassi and a large bottle of mineral water
bisleri or himalayan spring sir
that will be with you in fifteen minutes sir
have a nice day
he hangs up and goes through another set of doors
to a cramped kitchen with definite hygiene problems
the cooks are playing carom on the table while under it salim is dozing
two chicken burgers coke mango lassi and a bottle of bisleri
dozily salim gets up and takes a look behind one of the fridges
he chases out a chicken with a desultory kick and sorts through some empty mineral water bottles until he finds a bisleri bottle
salim fills the bottle of mineral water from the tap and begins delicately re sealing the tamper proof lid with super glue
jamal collects cutlery and starts laying out a tray
im going to chowpatti again okay
want to come
for gods sake
you got some disease
you force me back to this shit hole we leave our friends a good life loads of money for this
isnt that enough
we came back to find her
no you did jamal not me
me i dont give a shit about her
plenty of pussy in bombay for salim
oh yes sir
you should come down the cages on saturday night instead of searching for your lost love
im going to chowpatti
impersonating ram im going to chowpatti
there are nineteen million people in this city jamal
but she wasnt
jamal is dodging the traffic at a busy junction
he moves around the beggars who are working the cars
then he hears singing
he looks around suddenly panicked
it is a siren song drawing him across the road not even noticing that he is narrowly run down by a couple of cars to a traffic island underneath a
he turns a corner and there is the singer leaning up against one of the struts of the flyover
older now just like jamal a fourteen year old boy
but eye less
he approaches arvind and waits until he has finished singing
despite his eyeless sockets arvind appears to know somebody is there
he turns and bows low putting his hands together
any kindness you give will be repaid in heaven many times
jamal gets a couple of notes out of his pocket and puts them into arvinds outstretched hand
he feels the notes with his fingers
and a hundred
blessings upon you sahib
how do you know
there are many ways of seeing
arvind puts his hands together and bows deep again
then jamal takes his shoe off and gets out a hundred dollar bill
jamal crouches down and puts the bill into arvinds hand
his fingers feel it
he sniffs it
but how many
now you are playing with me sahib
what is on it
with a clock on it
trees behind it
the other side
turn it over
a man it doesnt say his name
he is sort of bald but has long hair on the sides
smiling benjamin franklin
my god my god
thank you sahib
you were generous the first time
and without even a song
a long pause
arvind keeps hold of jamals arm
so you are rich now are you jamal
i am happy for you
i am so sorry arvind
you got away
that is all
no no tears
tears mock me all the more
arvind i am looking for hows your voice jamal
i dont know
i havent sung since since then
arvind i and your eyes
surprised my eyes
my eyes are fine
then stay away chutiye and count your blessings every morning you open them and see the sun rising
you owe maman
he doesnt forget
i owe latika
arvind shakes his head angrily
is she alive
arvind is she alive
oh shes alive alright
its your life jamal
they call her cherry now
jamal heads off through the traffic
arvind shouts after him
i will sing at your funeral yaar
dark crowded streets
gangs of women stand outside the doorways or lean out of upstairs windows
they are garishly dressed prostitutes varying in age from to
men wander past eying the possibilities exchanging lewd comments with them
among the hordes on the pavement are jamal and salim
they pass doorway after doorway of narrow rooms where prostitutes wait for customers
jamal and salim stop at each group of women salim taking the lead clearly asking them something as the women either shrug or offer them something lewd judging by the
laughter that follows
but one woman in a narrow doorway points down the street
jamal has to drag a reluctant salim away from the group
they go into one of the tiny houses
loud filmi music comes from upstairs
they are confronted by a woman in her fifties watching tv
she is less than interested
im looking for cherry
plenty of others
take a look
she indicates curtained cubicles behind him
im latikas brother
the woman looks at him properly for the first time
shes still not on the menu
choose someone else or piss off
then jamal pulls out some rupee notes
just two minutes to talk to her
she takes the money counts it
she nods upwards
salim and jamal head up the dark tiny staircase
the woman picks up the phone on her desk
on the tiny landing salim and jamal pull back a curtain to reveal a humping couple
they move on past more women lying on their beds or blankly having sex not in the least perturbed to be interrupted
they reach the end of the landing
from the other side of the door comes the filmi music
jamal puts his eye to one of the gaps in the slatted door
through it he can see glimpses of a girl dancing to the music
latika though not the rag picker of before
now fifteen she is a beautiful young woman and dressed in a revealing turquoise silk sari
is it her or not
he shoves jamal out of the way and watches
shit shes sexy man
then the music stops an effeminate man steps into the limited frame salim can see and snaps a stick down hard on latikas hand
you entice with the hands not make chapattis you gawaar
the man starts the music again and latikas hands flow elegantly around her head
lift your feet you lump
the stick is raised to hit her but jamal opens the door
she can barely believe her eyes
the dance teacher turns
what the hell do you want
he switches off the music
but latika remains fixed
you silly little boys
get out now while you can
come with us
latika runs to jamal
but she freezes as she looks at the doorway
maman punnoose and the woman from downstairs stand there
the skin around punnooses eye bears the blisters from the chloroform burn years ago
look who we have here punnoose
hello again jamal
never forget a face
especially one that i own
shall i take them to the marshes
whatever you like
just make sure that you dispose of them properly afterwards
no traces thank you
he turns to jamal
you really thought you could just walk in and take my prize away
have you any idea how much this little virgin is worth bhen chod
he fingers latikas hair
get them out of here
punnoose and the muscle walk towards jamal
maman turns to the dance teacher as they grab his arms
please continue master ji
the dance teacher puts the music back on
suddenly salim is holding a pistol
get over there
punnoose and the muscle slowly release jamal and join maman
lets not be foolish salim
heavy arent they
salim straightens up his gun arm
you can have money
maman gets out his wallet and throws all the money in it on the floor
disappear with your friend and well forget all about this
salim collects up the money
maman never forgets
isnt that right
oh maman can make an exception
salim walks over to the music turns it up
picks up a cushion from the bed and walks right up to maman
cant take that risk maman
he wraps the cushion around the gun and pulls the trigger
or tries to
there is a frozen moment as they watch him fail to shoot
everybody watches with surreal interest as salim fumbles with the pistol
eventually he looks up giggles stupidly
shrugs apologetically and shoots
nobody is more surprised than maman who crumples onto the floor
latika starts desperately gathering up the notes on the floor grabs mamans wallet
jamal just stands
they run out of the room and down the stairs as maman dies on the floor in front of his frozen colleagues
children are splashing in the sea flying kites digging sand laughing
salim latika and jamal are crouched on the shore watching the sun sink into the sea
latika is going through mamans wallet salim is fingering the pistol admiringly
jamal is staring out to sea
each in their own world yet sharing swigs from a bottle of johnny walker
shit theres thousands here
we should be celebrating
you just killed somebody
he was going to kill us
where did you get the gun
now im going to have to throw this beauty in the sea
you didnt need to kill him
i save your life and youre on at me
all you ever do is mess us up
whenever youre around shut up cant you
just shut up
why cant you just be happy huh
you got what you wanted didnt you
so lets celebrate
she takes a long swig from the bottle
while we can
she nudges jamal and holds the bottle out to him
smiles at him
he smiles back shakes the black dog from his head and takes a long long drink
latika and salim cheer
latika salim and jamal bend back a bit of the wire mesh fence that protects the deserted hotel
a very wobbly latika salim and jamal walk up the frozen escalators of the empty hotel lit only by security lights
kick through the odd pile of rubbish and stacked up chairs
go to the dusty reception desk
we want a room boy
executive class with smoking
third floor with balcony
sea facing yaar
have the bags brought up
and they scoot off giggling into the dark
jamal and latika wander the vast empty kitchens
jamal searches the empty chillers and cabinets
then realises that he is alone
where are they
suddenly room service
she comes shooting out of the darkness across the kitchen floor riding a trolley with salim pushing her at top speed
jamal has to skid out of the way
he grabs another trolley and glides off in pursuit
the three stand by a mirror and play with their reflections
on top of the metal preparation counters salim and jamal are fencing jamal with a fish slice and salim with a large spoon
an empty dusty hotel suite
jamal is on the phone
i want a bottle of johnny walker red label beer wine chicken
jamal closes his eyes at the wonderful thought
what kind of chicken
also dreaming tikka masala
with roti naan chutney dal aloo gobi rice she stops
change of mind
hold the line chutiye
on the tv
everybodys happy when they have pop tarts
a bucket of pop tarts chutiye
jamal slams down the phone
latika is clearly in the shower
jamal wanders in carrying an old pair of lunghi
shouts through the door
found some lunghi
the shower stops
ill know if youre looking
with a towel around her latika comes to the doorway where jamal is holding out a the lunghi with his eyes tight shut
she watches this innocent a second with true fondness
youre a sweet boy jamal
she takes the lunghi from his outstretched hand and disappears into the bathroom slamming the door with a giggle
salim wanders the crowded streets of a slum
he stops uncertainly at a doorway where a group of men are lolling smoking
plucks up his courage
im looking for javed bhai
ja mada chod
hes not looking for you
i need to see him
the group of men stir irritated now
salim begins to back away then stops
pulls the gun from behind his back
i killed maman
ill kill you too
the group are frozen
you killed him
javed is standing in the doorway
my enemys enemy is my friend no
so come in friend
jamal and latika lie on the bed drunk though still coherent
latika is dressed in the bell boys jacket and the old lunghi
mamans gang will hunt us
you know that
i dont care
they burst into stupid laughter
the laughter subsides
that dance you were doing
in pila street
latika rolls over and switches off the light
in the half light her hands begin to move for jamal the elegant alluring hand movements of the bar girl dancers
jamal stares mesmerised
you came back for me
i thought youd forgotten
i never forgot
not for one day
i knew id find you in the end
its our destiny
latika stops her hands
they stare at each other their faces inches away from each other
latika strokes jamals face
and face to face they slowly fall asleep
jamal opens his eyes
salim is standing over them swaying with alcohol
he puts his hand out to latika
bhai youve had a lot to drink
jamal tries to get up but salims hand is round his throat and pushes him down on the bed
i am the elder
and i am the boss
for once you do as i say
salim pulls latika to her feet
i saved your bloody life didnt salim please chup sali
as he turns pulling a protesting latika jamal leaps on him
the two brothers go down fighting but of course it is salim who comes up on top
latika launches herself at salim but he smashes her away almost delighted that she has joined in
he drags jamal to the door laughing
salim throws him out into the corridor slams the door
i am number one now
salim no no
get yourself a room bhai
salim slams the door
jamal gets up bangs on the door keeps on banging until the door opens and salim stands there with the pistol pointing straight at jamals head
the man with the colt says chup
he shoves jamal hard down the corridor the gun pointed at him all the while
salim nods towards the fire escape door
or gunmaster g will shoot you right between the eyes
dont think he wont
you have five seconds
one two three four salim cocks the pistol
jamal screws up his eyes for the inevitable
but salim shoves him out with a roar and slams the door
jamal bangs on the door
salim walks slowly back down the corridor as jamal bangs and bangs on the door
down the hall salims door shuts
the inspector is staring hard at jamal
srinivas is desperately trying to get his attention
eventually enlighten us constable
accessory to murder sir
the inspector puts his hands in the air palms up
only the finest minds in the mumbai police force
untroubled by irony srinivas looks extremely pleased
go check the files constable
srinivas goes out
you puzzle me slumdog
admitting murder to avoid a charge of fraud is not exactly clever thinking
now why would you do that
when somebody asks me a question i tell them the answer
at the gate a security guard is sitting in his chair
where are they
the guard grunts
where did they go
a more impatient grunt from the guard
he stands up walks towards jamal
i dont know and i dont care
the guard raises his stick and gives him a roar
jamal backs away onto the street
the guard slams the gate shut
jamal looks despairingly up and down the street at the teeming traffic the crowds
ready for another question
we are back in the studio
for two and a half million rupees
ladies and gentlemen
cambridge circus is in which uk city
is it a oxford b leeds c cambridge d london
why does that worry me
torrential rain is hammering on the tin roofs of the slum
eighteen year old jamals eyes open
now with the beginnings of a beard and moustache jamal wakes in a tiny shack just big enough for a mattress on the floor
he pulls on a shirt lifts the mattress and takes out his trousers which have been pressing there all night puts them over his shoulder picks up his shoes and
goes down a ladder
he descends into a room and two feet of water that is eddying around the ground floor of the shack
wades out of the door into the narrow lane of the slum
jamal nods hello to a number of neighbours also bare legged also with their shoes in hand
together they wade to higher ground put on their trousers and shoes and trudge up to the main road
ultra modern glass windowed office
the words cultural studies are written on the white board
jamal walks in with a tray of glasses of chi
he puts a glass down on the young hip teachers desk and heads out again
okay guys its been a big week in uk
kat is back
he holds up a copy of radio times showing kat from east enders smiling at them
a collective groan from the trainees
shes already back
she did come back then she went away when alfie split up with her and now shes back again
but it looks as if alfie still fancies mo after all so thank you jamal
keep up bardi
the chi wallah knows more than you
bardi glares at jamal
jamal shrugs apologetically and goes out
okay its been super duper hot for uk this week so therell be a lot of chat about that they love their weather and theres the festival in edinburgh edinburgh
he points at a young woman trainee
kilts castles err haggis
porridge the highlands mountains
ben ben nevis
the teacher points at another trainee
whisky sean connery
their word for lakes
its also double bonus time for an upgrade to the friends and family package this week so remember to push for an upgrade
jamal walks out turns a corner
we are confronted with a room you could swing a boeing in
rows and rows of operators in tiny booths stretch into the distance
on the walls are pictures of london tony blair red telephone boxes the yorkshire dales the highlands a snapshot of tourist britain
huge posters of soap stars and celebrities adorn the rest of the walls
slogans hang from the ceiling
when the sun comes up youd better be running you snooze you lose upgrade for a better faster life
every call is a new opportunity
each section of the room has a banner with a british citys name on it and various mock sign posts for the different aisles
a manager under the banner bradford is standing over an operator listening in on a call
the manager leans over and presses a key
if they want an upgrade a new tariff or were stealing them from the other networks you take the call
anything else he mimes cutting his throat
no time wasters on team bradford kid
leave that to the homosexuals on tunbridge wells
jamal stops by him
the manager takes a glass of tea from jamal
whereve you been
dave on cornmarkets virtually lost his voice theres two on ilkley moor whove had their hands up for hours
come on move it
jamal hurries down the aisle signposted cornmarket gets to a male trainee and hands him a tea
dave glances around to check nobodys looking and slips off his head set
two minutes jamal
im on millionaire duty
its my turn jamal
ive had my pee breaks
if he comes just keep your head down and pretend youre doing an upgrade on the friends and family
jamal still looks unwilling
dave heads off towards a rest and recreation room where a big plasma screen on the wall is showing who wants to be a millionaire
jamal grabs the jacket from the back of daves chair puts the head set on and hunches over the booth just another operative at work
we become aware that every operator down the cornmarket aisle and quite a few other aisles besides is staring in the direction of the rest and recreation room
dave is watching the screen
if you want a chance to be a contestant on who wants to be a millionaire dial the number now
dave dives for the doorway and waves
suddenly all the operators are dialling
almost simultaneously twenty or so voices say
id like to be a contestant on who wants to be a millionaire
most of the operators including the man next to jamal suddenly lose their tension
i never get it
you have to dial when prem says if
if you want the chance to be a contestant on who wants to be a millionaire
thats when they open the lines
the operator looks at him
thats what anjum in technical says
he put the system in
so why dont you
have i been transferred again for gods sake
jamal freezes with fear
the head set speaks again with its broad scottish accent
jesus god will somebody talk to me
he stares at the computer
mackintosh from king gussie
weary its kingussie love
so where are you from
abroad i bet
china or somewhere
what good is just down the road from your house mrs mackintosh
next to the loch
suspicious oh aye
jamal searches desperately around spots a picture of big ben
loch big loch ben
next door to detective taggarts flat
och no hen thats one of the wee ones up in the highlands
youre all the way up there
but i bet it rains eh hen
indeed yes mrs mackintosh
i have to wade through a metre of water every morning
yes yes mrs mackintosh
in my kilt
och no hen
jamal puts his feet on the desk
its alright once ive had my porridge my haggis and a few scotch whiskies and the monsoons nearly over so and what monsoon would that be
id like to speak to your supervisor son
i dont think thats a good idea
he is a very important man mrs mackintosh get me the supervisor on this line now and he doesnt like bloody time wasters
jamal panics presses the button he saw the manager press earlier
the screen goes blank then reboots itself
jamal looks around
where the hell is dave
on the screen jamal is faced with the question what name do you require
he looks around again and then with one finger types in the word latika
he presses enter
hundred upon hundred of latikas with their surnames and phone numbers scroll down the page
he erases her name and enters the name salim k
fifteen numbers come up
he stares at the numbers for a long time then types it into his computer and presses dial
who wants to know
do you know what bloody time it is
clearly not jamals brother
jamal cuts the line
dials the next number
clearly not his salim
he cuts the line
who is this
but jamal cant speak
is someone screwing with me
who is this
i am calling from xl communications sir
as a valued customer we are offering you a free upgrade with our friends and jamals voice peters out
is that you
where are you man
i thought you were dead or something
we had to go jamal
they were searching the hotel
jamal say something
there is another long silence
ever been to cambridge
ever been to the circus
and ive never been to uk before
but ill still have a go
gasps and laughter from the audience
jamal laughs and shrugs
prem grips his heart theatrically
can someone call me an ambulance
a flash of a sign post reading oxford circus pointing down one of the aisles
the banner above that section of the warehouse reads london
jamal hurrying down another kings parade carrying glasses of tea
he glances up to see a large banner that says cambridge
jamal comes back up an aisle named broad street
an operator on the adjacent the high clicks his fingers for another cup
jamal hurries under the sign marked oxford
the signposts of the aisles come faster and faster pembroke street trafalgar square east india dock and finally cambridge circus
jamal is sweating his face scrunched up in thought
i cant remember
you cant remember
does that mean you did know
i dont think its oxford
based on your extensive travelling right
almost to himself well oxford has broad street saint aldates turl street queen street the high and magdalene bridge which is pronounced maudlin so he stops as he hears the
surprised laughter of the audience
i thought you hadnt been to uk
oh i havent
and its not leeds because thats elland road kirkgate market commercial street st peters icy what might it be then jamal
well i dont think its cambridge
cambridge circus is not in cambridge
dare i ask why
theres definitely an oxford circus in london and theres a rowing race between oxford and cambridge so theres probably a cambridge circus too
ill go for d london
thats the logic thats got him this far ladies and gentlemen
who are we to argue
apka final jawab
shrugs if the gods are with me
the lights dim the music swells as prem pushes the button on his computer
computer ji d lock kiya jaye
more portentous music
its been a rollercoaster ride all the way a pleasure to have you on the show my friend but im sorry to say that youre
incredibly absolutely right
huge cheers and applause
even jamal laughs at this
he cannot quite believe it himself
ladies and gentlemen jamal malik the man with two and a half million rupees
prem hands him a cheque
jamal looks at it
a few hours ago you were fetching tea for the phone wallahs
now you are richer than they ever will ever be
what a player ladies and gentleman
what a player
the lights dim the music swells
prem consults his computer
for five million rupees my friend who invented the revolver
was it a samuel colt b bruce browning c dan wesson or d james revolver
a flash of salim shooting maman
another flash of salim in the doorway holding the pistol up to jamals head
are you sure
the music swells again
prem presses his computer
you had two and a half million rupees
if i may
he holds out his hand
jamal hands him back the cheque
he tears the cheque in two
ladies and gentlemen the chi wallah has done it again
cheers and applause from the audience
not that incredible
youd just murdered somebody with a colt after all
it was self defence
lets call it manslaughter then shall we
getting hot in here isnt it
genuinely are you nervous
the audience laugh
prem is momentarily flustered
am i nervous
youre the one whos in the hot seat my friend
hes got prem on the run
prem presses his computer
what sports do you play
oh dear oh dear oh dear
not to worry theres only ten million rupees at stake
which cricketer has scored the most first class centuries in history
was it a sachin tendulkar b ricky ponting c michael slater d jack hobbs
prem allows the question to sink in
youve got a cheque for five million rupees in your hands
youve still got two life lines phone a friend and
for ten million rupees pay play or bail out
its still an option
remember if you get the answer wrong you will lose everything like that
he clicks his fingers
are you sure you want to do this
an indian batsman hits a nicely timed stroke heads down the wicket for a single
the other batsman is taking a second run
the indian tries to halt the other batsman with a shout then succumbs to the inevitable and charges down the wicket
a fielder hurls the ball at the stumps
the bails fly off
tense laughter from the audience
prem holds up the cheque
prem tears it up slowly
allows the pieces to fall to the floor
the dreams of so many
on the floor
jamal is riding the construction lift to the top of a high building still just a shell but buzzing with carpenters bricklayers cable layers
the lift stops at the top
jamal gets out
he is miles up
jamal looks around
there is salim standing on the edge of the building
he saunters over to jamal his arms outstretched in theatrical greeting
he is groomed expensively dressed with the best mobile money can buy dangling from a gold chain around his neck
god is good bhai
god is good
he tries to embrace jamal
with as much force as he can muster jamal punches him in the face
salim takes it
wipes blood from his lip
gets another punch
then another and another not even defending himself until he is being beaten back by a raging jamal towards the edge of the building
finally he tries to reason with jamal mamans boys were after us
had to skip
jamal keeps on beating him back
left a message at reception
waited weeks for you in nagpur
there was no message at reception
bhai i left a message
salim opens his arms defenceless
it would take one small push to send him over the edge
there is a moment when jamal might
he even has his hands on his chest
i will never forgive you
the fury in jamal subsides minutely
finally he turns away with a roar of frustration
salim hangs his head
jamal and salim are sitting on the very edge of the building
they can see for miles across the city
salim has rediscovered his attitude
can you believe it
this was our slum
we lived just there huh
now it is business apartments call centres
fuck usa fuck china
india is at the centre of the world now bhai
and i am at the centre of the centre jamal
this is all javed bhais
the gangster from our slum
you work for him
who else would protect us from mamans gang huh
what do you do for him
anything he asks
salims mobile rings
salim is immediately subservient on the phone
he is coming
you must go
he hands jamal a card
you think i am going to let you out of my sight again little brother
you stay with me now
salim wheres latika
shes gone jamal
jamal gets up hurries away hidden behind piles of building materials just as javed appears in his flash suit and jewelry
three of his young henchmen walk alongside
jamal is asleep on a mattress on the floor of a smart apartment
a mobile phone rings
the muffled sound of salim talking quietly next door
then salim creeps into the room checks to see jamal is asleep unlocks a desk drawer and brings out his pistol
he puts it in a hold all and goes out the front door
jamals eyes snap open
he has seen it all
slum dogs never sleep only nap
he would disappear for a couple of days and come back changed
sometimes elated the door bangs open and a giggling drunk half naked bar girl drags the sleeping jamal up and into the bathroom
he has flipped
i cant do anything with him
salim is in the bath bathing literally in money
look at it bhai look at it
sometimes the opposite
jamal creeps towards salims bedroom door
he pushes it open a fraction to see salim crouched on the floor in prayer sobbing quietly
whispering ae khuda mujhe baksh de maine bahut gunaah kiye hain
but younger brothers dont interfere
salim comes out of his apartment block
gets into his jeep
doesnt notice jamal in the motor rickshaw that pulls out and follows him
salim approaches a gate house to a large bungalow
the door keeper nods to him rings a bell
from the rickshaw jamal watches a woman come to the door
eighteen completely beautiful and rich
she hands salim a package and goes back inside
salim gets in his jeep and drives away
jamal approaches the door keepers gate house
baba i am the new cook from the agency
a thousand apologies i am late for the memsaab
the door keeper grunts and goes inside
after a brief pause he returns
she doesnt know anything about any cook
theres supposed to be a dishwasher being delivered
know anything about that
baba i am your dishwasher
the door keeper grunts at this attempt at humour
latika appears at the gate
havent i told you dont interrupt when im watching she looks at jamal
is silenced briefly
ill show you the kitchen
latika and jamal go into the kitchen
who wants to be a millionaire plays on the tv in the background
she turns and hugs him tight
they laugh with happiness
delighted jamal jamal look at you
their heads are close they might kiss
then latika turns away stares out of the window
are wa jamal
jamal smiles hopefully at her
but there is sadness in her now
she takes her sunglasses off rubs her eyes
there is a bruise there
youve hurt your eye
why are you here
to see you
you see me
she stands there challenging
on the tv somebody is winning money
why does everyone love this programme
its the chance to escape isnt it
walk into another life
doesnt everyone want that
you have another life
a rich one
whod have thought it possible
a slum dog with all this
are you happy
i have five star food five star clothes
i sleep in a bed not on the street
from where we come from jamal that is happiness
you dont look so happy with a black eye
you turn up here out of nowhere telling me im not happy how dare you
voices at the gate house
god javed will kill you
you are with him
she throws him an apron
he gets it on just in time for javed to walk in
jamal turns away
first you want a dishwasher now a bloody cook i just thought chup
the crickets on
javed changes channel and dials on his mobile
why do you always watch that shit
im already a millionaire
he laughs at his own joke
turns to jamal
well come on then cook
get me a sandwich
javed stares at jamal a moment trying to place a face he vaguely recognises
then the bookie comes on the line and he turns back to the television
latika hurries around the kitchen getting out bread and condiments whispering while javed talks on the phone
come away with me
and live on what
what can you provide
what have you got jamal
on the mobile yeah
hes on eighty five
i want four lakh on him making a century
what are you giving
okay make it five lakh
javed pours himself a glass of whisky never taking his eyes from the television
we are watching history unfold today at the wankhede stadium as sachin tendulkar carves his way towards another magnificent century and the record books
his thirty eighth century the most by any indian cricketer ever
that will feed us will it
it wont buy you a new dishwasher but it might make you happy
where have you been
get in the real world jamal
you and me
that is the real world
come away with me
latika snatches the sandwich from him and gives it to javed
goes back to jamal whispers under cover of putting condiments away
salim will help us
you still believe in salim
ill be gone soon anyway
bombays got too dangerous for she indicates javed
you think hed tell me
straight bat straight bat dammit
then the batsman at the other end calls to take a second run
tendulkar seems to agree tries to halt the other batsman with a shout then succumbs to the inevitable and charges down the wicket
a fielder hurls the ball at the stumps
the bails fly off
no no no
stupid ben chod idiot
he flings his glass of whisky at the television
suddenly tastes what he has been eating
and what is this shit supposed to be mader chod
javed throws the sandwich at him and slams out of the room
his footsteps can be heard stomping into another room
now go before he kills us both
she leads jamal to the door
latika wheres my bloody shirt
latika shouts over her shoulder
back to jamal
whispered you want to do something for me
then forget me
ill wait at vt station
five oclock every day until you come
she shakes her head
i love you
so what jamal
loudly now get out and tell your no good agency not to send anybody else until theyve learnt to cook
she slams the door
hurries back into the kitchen throws javeds plate into the sink
the door keeper comes in
madam your dishwasher has arrived
leaning over the sink latika weeps silently
salim has his hand around jamals throat
why cant you let it alone
you want money ill give you money
i can get you girls
you know what i want
youre like some crazy man youre obsessed
she is my destiny salim
know what your destiny is crazy boy
a bullet between the eyes
and after that hell kill her
is that what you want

shes already half dead
salim takes his hand away from jamals neck
about that you are right
you sold her
fierce i didnt sell her
javed wanted her
he gets what he wants
he turns away bitterly
shes doing alright
get it into your thick head jamal
shes not yours and she never will be
time for a commercial break ladies and gentlemen
i know i know i cant stand the tension either
dont even think about leaving your seat
well be back
the lights flick back on
prem slumps back in his chair
youve got the luck of the devil yaar ill give you that
i i need to oh the toilet
naveed jamal wants the bog
the floor manager and a security guard usher jamal off stage
prem looks up at the gallery raises his eyes at the director
then he gathers himself and heads off stage
the clock reads five oh three
jamal stands on the footbridge
humanity washes around him
his eyes dart around frightened to miss her
checks the clock again
the platform is almost deserted
he wanders away
prem wanders down the corridor followed by a security guard
another security guard is waiting at the entrance to the toilet
prem goes in leaving the two guards in the corridor
jamal stands on the footbridge gazing down at the hordes of commuters
five oclock five fifteen five thirty
jamal rests his head against the railings
jamal is in one of the cubicles
prem goes to the urinal
a guy from the slums becomes a millionaire overnight
you know the only other person whos done that
i know what its like
i know what youve been through
im not going to become a milionaire
i dont know the answer
laughs youve said that before yaar
prem finishes pissing
goes over to the washbasins runs the taps and washes his hands
no i really dont
you cant take the money and run now
youre on the edge of history kid
i dont see what else i can do
maybe it is written my friend
youre going to win this
trust me youre going to win
jamal flushes and comes out of the cubicle
goes to the washbasins
in the mist on the mirror above the taps is written the letter b
jamal stares at it
gradually it fades leaving only the growing fury on his face staring back at him
jamal stalks back onto the set
sits down in his chair
stares at prem who looks unconcernedly back
the digital clocks show five fifteen
shoving the descending river of people out of his way the seventeen year old jamal is forging a path up steps that cross the platforms
he pushes to the middle of the footbridge and leans out on the side railings
he scans the sea of people desperately
then he sees her the eighteen year old latika heart stoppingly beautiful over the other side of the station
a world away
she is scanning the crowd as wired as he is
but though he is screaming her name his voice is swallowed by the noise around him
then he sees two thuggish looking men also fighting a way towards her
frightened now he fights his way down the steps one figure against an army of white robed people
he gets to the bottom of the steps is making progress against the tide
but so are the two men
jamal is now on the same platform
shouts her name again
she turns with a smile
but the two thugs leap through a train onto her platform
she sees them starts running is lost in the crowd
jamal runs off along the platform after latika
by the time jamal has fought himself to where latika was she is gone
he whirls around mad with frustration
latika is jumping the tracks crossing in front of trains
but the thugs are gaining on her
he brings her down and drags her across to javeds waiting mercedes
salim is standing by the car
jamal pushes through the crowds just in time to see salim bundling her into the car
salim spits disgustedly on the ground
latika twists her head to see jamal as the car skids off
jamal screams with hopeless fury
jamal and prem stare at each other
do the right thing and in approximately three minutes you will be as famous as me
and as rich as me
from rags to raja
its your destiny
applause from the audience
welcome back to who wants to be a millionaire
in the chair tonight is jamal malik as if we dont know
in an amazing run jamal has already five million rupees but not content with that has chosen to gamble for one crore thats ten million million rupees
what a player
the question one more time which cricketer has scored the most first class centuries in history
was it a sachin tendulkar b ricky ponting c michael slater d jack hobbs
i know it isnt sachin tendulkar
thats a start
so it could be ricky ponting jack hobbs or michael slater
ill use a life line
computer take away two wrong answers
music swells lights dim
well you were right about sachin tendulkar
the computer has taken away a sachin tendulkar and c michael slater
that leaves you a fifty fifty choice jamal
b ricky ponting or d jack hobbs
what do you think
for half a million rupees
your answer b ricky ponting or d jack hobbs
a hideous never ending pause while jamal stares into prems eyes
a barely perceptible jump from prem
not b ricky ponting
do you know
jamal shakes his head
so it could be b ricky ponting
a just perceptible narrowing of the eyes
computer ji d lock kiya jaye
prem turns to the computer
with one hundred and ninety seven first class centuries the answer is
the audience go wild
prems smile is thin
jamal malik crorepati
the camera goes off prem for a second
he mimes a disgusted spit
then he is back on
i cannot believe what i am seeing here tonight ladies and gentlemen
so are you ready for the final question for two crore rupees twenty million rupees
not really but
maybe it is written no
for twenty million rupees the final question on who wants to be a millionaire
the lights dim again the portentous music increases
suddenly a klaxon sounds
the audience burst into nervous laughter and groans
just when i thought i would need a pacemaker fitted were out of time
what a show ladies and gentlemen what a show
join us tomorrow night to see if jamal malik has made the biggest mistake of his life or has just won the biggest prize in the history of indian television
same place same time
you wouldnt dare miss it
the studio lights come up
prem switches off his smile as fast as the cameras switch off
gets up and pulls out his mobile
waving a kitchen knife in on hand a desperate jamal slams through the gates of javeds bungalow the objecting doorkeeper running along behind
he bangs open the front door
the place has been stripped of everything
not a single thing remains
jamal runs into another room
as empty as the first
he stops in his tracks
where is she
he grabs the door keeper by the shirt collar slams him up against the wall
holds the knife against his throat
i dont know
wouldnt say would they
they had to get out fast
jamal lets go of the door keeper
goes hopelessly to the window
on the window sill is a phone
he picks it up
there is a dial tone
jamal rummages in his trouser pocket
gets out the battered card with salims details on
salim picks up
where are you
where is she
salim is stalking around his room in javeds new house
hold alls of clothes and possessions lie around the room
a chest of drawers sits with its drawers open still empty
where youll never find her
you could have joined us you bloody idiot been one of us
youve lost everything now
cuts the call off and slings the phone in a drawer
takes the gun from his waist and throws that in too
slams the drawer shut with as much force as he can
the line goes dead
jamal slides to the floor
the camera pulls out from jamals face revealing that jamal is sitting on the floor of salims apartment
in the background can be heard the sound of the television
jamal looks at the knife in his hand wonders what he might do with it
the sound of prems voice on the tv
if you want a chance to play who wants to be a millionaire call now
jamal looks up
stares at the tv
this way jamal this way
great show my friend
see you tomorrow huh
in the half light prem guides him to a stage door
jamal steps outside the backstage door
leans on the rail and takes a huge breath
immediately a blanket is thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into the back of a police van
the director joins prem at the back stage door as the van pulls away sirens screaming
whats going on
hes a cheat
this was you
you called them
how dyou know hes cheating
oh come on
of course he is
hes a bloody village boy
even when i fed him the wrong answer the little shit got it right
director stares at him
you gave him an answer
well i didnt exactly the director walks away shaking his head
in the doorway nita is standing there watching
but she too turns and walks away
it is all bizarrely plausible
because i am a slum dog chi wallah i am a liar right
most of you are
srinivas comes hurrying in carrying a file very pleased with himself
shooting at pila street october th
victim pronounced dead at scene
suspects absconded two males early teens one female early teen
the inspector takes the file
stares at it
shakes his head
but you youre not a liar mister malik that is for sure
you are too truthful
he turns to srinivas
thank you constable
all that remains is to work out whether it was manslaughter or murder
ten years or life
the young constable sticks his head around the door
the commissioners here sir
the inspector sighs
accompanied by srinivas he leaves the room
jamal sits there
lets his head drop
the camera floats from the room down the dingy corridor and out through a window
alighting on a crowd of hundreds of people jostling to get a view of the building
news crews are setting up around them
a tv reporter is doing a piece to camera
behind the walls of this police station lies the mystery all of india is talking about
did jamal malik an uneducated eighteen year old boy from the slums of mumbai win one crore rupees by fair means or foul
and in the crowds all around me there is an even bigger question
will he be back on the show tonight to play for twenty million rupees
the commissioner is waiting in the outer office
have you charged him yet
i progress is being made sir
have you charged him
the commissioner dumps a copy of the times of india down on the desk
then the hindustan times the amar ujala and the afternoon dispatch thump down after them
all have photos of jamal on who wants to be a millionaire on the front page
and if that isnt enough for you
he motions the inspector to come over to the window
lifts the blind
the inspector hurries over
the boys a bloody hero with every beggar and thief in the city
were in danger of looking very stupid here inspector
whilst im not convinced he actually cheated i have got the inspector brandishes the file
prem kumar himself a man of great standing and integrity said the kid was a liar and a cheat
what more do you need
the inspector pauses
then he puts the file behind his back
srinivas coughs pointedly
gets a steely look from the inspector
the commissioner has been staring out of the window at the crowds
turns back to them
hes in for fraud so you charge him for fraud
or youll find yourself on traffic duty at the gateway of india
the commissioner walks out
not a word srinivas
a cheek scarred by disfiguring knife scars
pulling back we see it is latika staring frozen at jamal on the television news
a palatial living room
dealing cards to salim is javed khan
a couple of bar girls giggle next to javed and a couple of his thugs
pouring drinks at a sideboard is latika
javed glances up at the screen clearly not recognising jamal on a clip from who wants to be a millionaire
salim too is staring wide eyed at the tv
javed picks up the remote doesnt even notice and switches over to a music channel
latika hurries out
what about my bloody whisky woman
but she has already gone
he growls after her
he motions salim to get him a drink
javeds mobile rings as salim goes over to the sideboard
shifts a bottle to the back
ill just get syed
salim smiles faintly at the image of jamal and hurries out
a drawer opens
inside is salims pistol
and a phone the same one he threw in there months ago
salim stares at both for a long time
finally picks up the gun and phone
to himself final answer
he finds this faintly amusing
latika sits in the kitchen staring at the tv tears running down her cheeks
a reporter is talking in front of an enlarged photograph of jamal
latika wipes away the tears quickly as salim comes in
he locks the door behind him
stares at the tv
he will never give up
he shakes his head
salim approaches latika
she flinches as he walks towards her
he puts some car keys in front of her
but just drive
there wont be another chance
latika takes the keys
hell kill you
salim smiles shakes his head
it is not written
salim goes to the back door
opens it for her
salim points at the television
you have to
itll take you two hours if you drive fast
he holds out his mobile phone
for gods sake hold on to it
latika takes it
salim takes hold of both sides of her head for a moment
for what i have done please forgive me
salim releases her
have a good life
salim puts his hands together in blessing
salim shuts the door locks it
jamal is dozing in the chair
he wakes with a shout
srinivas has just thrown a bucket of water in his face
he unlocks the handcuffs
jamal looks up at him
youre back on the show
the audience for who wants to be a millionaire are standing in line
they are being body searched by police
mobiles are being confiscated and put in bags
gaffers make last minute adjustments to the lights shining on the empty chairs in the middle of the set
camera positions are checked by the floor manager
srinivas walks jamal through the police office past the inspector sitting at his desk his arms behind his head pondering
he watches jamal go and then asks what happened
to the girl
jamal walks on
the inspector watches him all the way
jamal sits in the back of the police jeep
it pulls out of the police station car park into a sea of people all cheering and shouting at the jeep
jamal looks terrified
latika drives through the slums of mumbai
she hoots her horn furiously at a cart driver ambling across the road
the jeep stops at the lights and a beggar wanders up tapping on the windscreen
the beggar studies jamals face for a second then starts shouting and pointing at him
other beggars just like the one jamal used to be join him and start cheering and applauding
the jeep pulls away
at the chi stall everyone gathers around the tv watching
a rickshaw parks up next to a hundred others
the driver leaps out abandoning the irate business man in the back and runs to the tv in the cafe
the manager walks into the aircraft hanger of a building
where is everyone
then he sees everyone crowded around the tv in the recreation room
get back to work
then he sees jamals face on the tv
the chi wallah
all along the highway one by one the televisions in a hundred shacks flick on silhouetting the family huddled in front of it
in the half light jamal is being powdered by nita
she finishes powdering jamal
what about me
im sweating here
you should be
she dumps the powder compact in his hand
the calypso bar
not if you were the only man in the world
she walks off
genuinely puzzled but i am the only man in the world
the traffic is gridlocked
latika is pumping the horn
come on come on
she glances out of the window sees one of the roadside shacks with the television on
gets out of the car and runs to it
the commissioner grabs his phone
get me the inspector on the phone now
the inspector wanders into his office still deep in thought
switches on the television just as the millionaire music starts
the phone rings
prem and jamal walk on stage
they take their seats to tumultuous applause
welcome back to who wants to be a millionaire
i can safely say that tonight is the biggest night of both of our lives ladies and gentlemen
jamal malik the call centre worker from mumbai has already won one crore rupees a cool ten million
tonight he can walk away with that in his pocket or make the biggest gamble in television history and go for the final question and a staggering twenty million rupees
jamal are you ready for that question
the lights dim the music rumbles
prem pushes the button on his computer
big reader are you jamal
a lover of literature
nervous laughter from the audience
jamal just shrugs
i can read
even more nervous laughter
in alexandre dumas book the three musketeers two of the musketeers are called athos and porthos
what was the name of the third musketeer
was it a aramis b cardinal richelieu c dartagnan d planchet
an involuntary laugh comes out of jamals mouth
in the shack sitting on an upturned oil drum surrounded by puzzled indians in rags a slow smile comes to latikas face
camera on prem
the final question for twenty million rupees and hes smiling
i guess you know the answer
would you believe it
theres nothing else to do
the audience groan
so youre going to take the ten million and walk
a gasp from the audience
you just said you dont know the answer
i heard that right
you do understand that if you get the answer wrong you lose everything
ten million rupees
a fortune jamal
a terrible pause
id like to phone a friend
were going to the wire ladies and gentlemen we are going to the wire
the final life line
here we go
prem presses his computer
ominous rumble of drums
the lights dim
a phone can be heard ringing the amplified sound echoing around the studio
the phone continues to ring
latika is staring at the television
then an electric current seems to shoot through her and she is running dodging the static traffic street vendors the odd cow heading for her abandoned car
hooting horns shouting drivers
the phone rings on
doesnt look as if your friend is in jamal
who is it
my brothers number but the sort of brother whod go for a walk on the twenty million rupee question
its the only number i know
on the passenger seat of latikas car salims phone continues to ring
youre on your own jamal
prem looks up at the gallery
the director shakes his head mimes cutting his throat
latika wrestles the door open grabs the phone
prem opens his mouth to speak
then out of the darkness of the studio hello
a gasp from the audience
thats cutting it fine
im guessing this isnt your brother
this is my name is latika
the first real smile of jamals adult life
a small smile spreads across the inspectors face
thats why hes on the show
he picks up his hat and hastens out of the room
javed pulls the bar girl from him stares open mouthed at the television
what the bloody
he pushes the girl off him
gets to his feet
so latika you want to hear the question one more time
and lets be clear about this
twenty million rupees ride on your answer
you have thirty seconds
jamal please read out the question to latika
is that really you
the question jamal
in alexandre dumas book the three musketeers two of the musketeers are called athos and porthos
what was the name of the third musketeer
was it a aramis b cardinal richelieu c dartagnan d planchet
the electronic clock ticks loudly
where are you
im im safe
so latika what do you think
five four three two one
i dont know
the audience groan
ive never known
you really are on your own now jamal
your answer for twenty million rupees
apka final jawab
the lights dim the music crescendoes
a buzz runs around the audience
prem pushes the button on his computer
stares hard at jamal
computer ji a lock kiya jaye
jamal malik call centre assistant from mumbai for two crore twenty million rupees you were asked who the third musketeer was in the novel by alexandre dumas
you used your final life line to phone a friend
you answered a
i have to tell you
the correct answer
prem jumps up and pulls a bemused jamal to his feet raising his arm in the air
jamal is smiling but disorientated
ladies and gentlemen jamal malik crorepati
what a night
we have all been present at the making of history ladies and gentlemen
jamal malik millionaire
to ever increasing roars and applause from the audience prem escorts jamal off stage
the line goes dead in latikas hand
she stares down at the phone
the bemused family are still eying her like an alien
she smiles at them and goes out
the traffic on the road is still grid locked
she starts walking faster and faster
then she breaks into a run
a small tv in the bathroom
teri ma ki chute
javed is banging on the door
salim gets up from where he has been praying
he climbs into the bath which is full of bank notes and lies down amongst the money
he reaches across for the pistol and picks it up
smiles slightly as javed smashes down the door pulls the trigger and shoots javed
he falls onto the floor dead
but the thug right behind him shoots salim in the chest
he lies back in the bath the faintest trace of a smile on his face as he stares at the pictures of jamal on the tv
god is good
prem and jamal are being posed by photographers
a giant sized cheque for twenty million rupees is manhandled onto the floor by the floor manager and an assistant amidst much cheering and laughter
jamal is snapped next to a scowling prem
the inspector appears next to them
just one more thing left sir
if youd like to come with me
he takes jamal by the arm leads him backstage
jamal sits silent in the back seat next to the inspector as he drives through the traffic
then truth alone triumphs
i should have known better
the inspector stops the jeep
unlocks the handcuffs
holds the back door open for jamal
thought you might need a lift sir
he nods towards the outside world
dazed jamal gets out
jamal finds himself gazing up at vt station
slowly he wanders inside
the inspector takes the contents of the file and tears them slowly in half
lets the pieces fall on the ground
gets back in the jeep and drives away
vt station is awash with the evening commute
thousands of people crowd the platforms jostling the only still figure who is sitting at the base of the statue of frederick stevens
then there is a gap in the wall of bodies that swirls around him
jamal gets to his feet
then she is gone in the melee again
only to reappear
jamal forces himself through the people
nothing will stop him
latika too is shoving them aside until they are face to face
they stop look at each other hold each others hands tight
the whole station seems frozen the only movement from a thousand bodies being jamal and latika
i thought we would meet again only in death
he shakes his head
i knew youd be watching
jamal puts his hand on latikas chin turns her head gently so that she is facing him
he sees the knife scars on her cheek for the first time
she tries to turn her head but he wont let her
runs his hand slowly down the scar
rests his hand there
this is our destiny
he gently kisses the scarred cheek
this is our destiny
the camera pulls back and back rising above the station
the music starts and the frozen station comes alive two thousand kurta clad men and saree clad women dancing in and out and on top of the trains an unbound
celebration of hope and humanity that has at its centre jamal and latika
