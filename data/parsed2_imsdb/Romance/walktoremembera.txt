burbank california all rights reserved a young mans v
i was born in beaufort north carolina
a place where the air always smells of pine and salt and sea
the voice is gentle
slightly southern in inflection
a young doctors soothing manner
a vast view of the coastline in winter beaches rivers sea marshes inlets ebbing and flowing
for many days and nights are spent fishing pamlico sound or crabbing the neuse river
the camera finds a small coastal town edged by a harbor on which fishermen toil
the camera moving inland crosses over modest houses decked with plastic rooftop santas
while the ocean may be the focus of daily labor churches have always tried to be the focus of life
and moves uphill to
where fake snow is sprayed on store windows
the camera continues to the far side of main street with its stately homes with big lawns flower beds and tasteful christmas garlands
when i lived here there were eighteen churches within town limits alone
from each corner four churches face each other
the fellowship hall christian church the church of the forgiven people the church of sunday atonement and all saints church
they sponsored pancake breakfasts rummage sales car washes and softball games
the camera finds and follows a newish sport utility vehicle with md plates as it passes a rummage sale and a softball game
youd think that all the people here were friendly welcoming open hearted
landon carter drives the truck
landon looks urban prosperous well groomed but retains his boyish whimsy and sense of irony
a cell phone and overnight bag on the seat next to him
and that money or family background or education or luck didnt matter
landon reaches out to adjust his side mirror revealing a simple gold wedding band on his left hand
landons truck turns the corner and slows in front of the huge southern baptist church
but they did matter
they mattered to everyone
except jamie sullivan
landons truck turns into a driveway just past the church and heads for a cluster of buildings
behind the buildings a cemetery
the truck pulls up in front of the old parsonage its a different color than he remembers
believer in god
landon hesitates a moment then climbs out of his truck
landon heads up the walk and onto the front porch
presses the doorbell
it rings inside
landon is edgy unsettled
believer in me
a nurse opens the door
rock music drifts out open doors barely recognizable as born in the u
brains preps richies heavy metals jocks punk rockers goths geeks
mixing without mixing
most are red eyed woozy wasted
a couple of boys break dance to a boom box
missing are the criminals
a shiny t top camaro roars up
stops tires squealing
van halen blasting
landon at the wheel
he is impulsive sexy troubled with the nothing to lose courage to act on destructive whims
he is envied copied feared
empties roll and clink on the floor
a tiny plastic skeleton dances as it hangs from the rearview mirror
landon stamps a joint into the ashtray
impatient edgy where is he
hes supposed to be here
from back seat i need to whizz
erics skinny high energy
a leg always jiggling
youre such a hummingbird
i wanna dance
belinda is landons girlfriend
richie princess a bad girl pretender
big shoulder pads
so go dance
pointing like tattoo dee plane
clays by the dumpster
clay obese wearing a too small student monitor vest is dumping garbage from a trash can
a loud honk
clay turns to see the camaro then turns back to the school coast clear
he quickly heaves in the empty trash can as the camaro pulls up
eric pushes a door open
empties fall from the back seat
clay climbs in
go go go go
principal ed kelly middle aged pockmarked skin casio calculator watch exits the gym
landons looking at kelly in the rearview mirror
he looks like his face caught fire and he tried to put it out with a fork
landon inches the car forward teasing clay teasing kelly
he couldnt find his own butt with both hands at high noon in a hall of mirrors
landon presses the gas
the car roars away
kellys so old he were done with that already bonehead
clay smiles good natured
he often misses social cues
landon drops clays student monitor vest out onto the road
another car runs it over
kelly walks over picks up the vest
eyes the empty beer bottles by the dumpster
camaro is parked on the dirt access road headlights shining through the locked rear gate
john cougar mellencamps small town playing
landon clay and belinda sit drinking smoking weed
under the music a cb radio scanner chats quietly
so which is it
eric finishes taking a leak
calling over repeating landon
to save your life you have to either go deaf or go numb in your dick and balls
eric climbs back in the car
landon belinda clay eric
the doctor only gives you three seconds to decide could i lose one ear and one nut
no questions no negotiating to eric annoyed where do you get these stupid questions
hypotheticals to belinda im just wondering dont wonder
landons looking out at the night
everyone looks up
a pale contemplative girl is jumping down off the gate caught in the headlights
wearing clothes she probably made herself long hair hiding her face
she lives in her mind not her body
jamie girl hearing the laughter gathers herself and approaches landons window her sneakers crunching in the gravel
she crosses her pilly brown sweater across her chest
to landon tentative hey
any chance you could
turn them off leaning over landon god give you this road
no then well be keeping the lights on
to jamie seeming nice if you want the lights off ill turn them off
and he does
thank you so very much
she backs away from the car grateful
from the car i cant see a friggin thing
landon switches on the dome lights for belinda
imitating jamie thank you
thank you so very much
but landons looking at jamie
almost counting the seconds
jamie scaling the fence practiced at it
landon quickly flicks the high beams
belinda eric and clay snicker and snort as they see jamie startled paused at the top
but instead of looking bullied her face shows determination humor even
a moment later she jumps down on the far side
belinda eric clay are still laughing
wherere you gonna be
to belinda mocking hypothetically
he clinks erics raised beer
but landons face clouds slightly maybe this isnt where hed really like to be
one step beyond
tales from the dark side
twilight zone dipshit
dont call him a dipshit
you do and you dont
beat re jamie whats she doing in there
nothing id be doing
landon kisses her
a blinding white light dances through the car and settles on landon and belindas faces
he scrambles out of the car
landon looks up at the fence
jamie sitting atop holding a large mirror reflecting the headlights back into the car
they stare at each other
his annoyance turns to mild respect
the cb radio comes to life inside the car
a garbled landon
landon leaps in
pops out the van halen
landon pops in a wham
amps it up
landon turns the car around
the camaro fishtails away
tires crunching red taillights bouncing on the rough road
the car turns left onto the paved road and speeds out of sight
landon drives recklessly
he makes a screeching turn
two fire trucks rumbling by houses sirens wailing
turns right following the fire trucks
landon smiles at belinda
she smiles back
landon takes a slug of beer
turns his eyes back to the road
make another turn
then a flash of light movement
a figure on the road
an old man walking his little dog
crossing the street
turns the wheel hard
jams his foot on the brake
the camaro swerves
a loud heart the old man sideswiped drops to the asphalt
the camaro slams into a light pole
landon eric and clay are banged up
belindas head leans on the dash
her shoulders shake
landon bleeding on the forehead reaches over
she lifts her head
looks at him
he kicks his door out
the camaro crumpled into the light pole
clay and eric and belinda getting out dazed
landon runs to the old man
the mans terrier barks at landon
the real landon showing for an instant
police sirens wail in the b
a battered chevette steers through a working class neighborhood
landons mother cynthia drives
shes weary with sun worn skin but still attractive
she wears a skimpy black and white cocktail waitress uniform under her coat
what if they expel you
kelly wouldnt do that
cuz nothing happened at school
he smiles his biggest most reassuring smile
dont smile at me
its not going to get you out of this
it always has before
by daylight a modern brick and glass structure
kelly gestures for landon to sit
his forehead still shows a bruise
i had hopes for you
like id grow up to be president another reagan
not laughing like youd make it to june
even cutting half your classes you have a b average
im no dummy
you just act like one
on his desk he places the empty bottles that rolled out of the camaro
those arent mine
they came from your car
i wasnt the one drinking
kelly holds up the police test finding
your blood alcohol level
maybe you were legally in the clear but i make the rules here
landon scowls knows hes defeated
you expelling me
now i can do what i want
sarcastic the world is your oyster
landon busts out arms high fists tight like a righteous political prisoner
he struts through the courtyard
not a care in the world
landon watches a tow truck lower the crumpled camaro
a neighbor kid josh watches from across the street on his way to school
landon pokes and prods his car the engine underneath the body the paint
a discouraging mess
landon knocks on cynthias bedroom door
i need a ride
she wears a black eye shield
her waitress uniform hangs over a chair
sleepy annoyed im not getting up to drive you somewhere
beat whatre you doing home
landon lifts the garage door
a murky place
filled with old tools and junk and a grim old bike
landon comes out the glass door his arms loaded sees his bike
no way to carry
he looks around
the bus stop
a bus approaching
banging ratcheting clinking
landons working hard
a boom box playing simple minds alive and kicking
and worn terry slippers appear
i want to talk to you
he pauses annoyed then rolls himself out
the mangled front bumpers on the ground
cynthia stands there in her bathrobe
landons almost too much
youre not hanging round here all day
im not hanging
im fixing my car you dont need a car you cant drive for a month
go see marvin
about a job
landon ignores her
slides back under his car
hes going to try you as assistant manager
beat you could be manager someday
landon cant believe this
landon slides back out
im not working there
cynthia sets her jaw
he knows that look
landon is sweating scouring pots
a crooked cap on his head an assistant manager name tag on his shirt
hes making some headway only two more to wash
marvin the owner walks over
beer belly greasy hair
dumps another pile of dirty pots and pans in landons sink
landon glimpses his future
landon paces jumpy
kellys secretary miss tarbox quietly locks her purse in her bottom drawer
whos he in with
hell be with you when hes available
the door to kellys office opens
jamie sullivan exits with her father the tall stern reverend hegbert sullivan
jamie eyes landon as she passes by
joking you expelled too
nobody laughs or even smiles
kelly makes a note in jamies file
finding the real world to your liking mr
i want to come back
looking up surprised back
were you ever really here
they both know kelly has the upper hand
kelly leans back in his chair relishing it
mumbling i want to graduate
kelly studies landon the boy who cant get out of his own way
thinking aloud you could grace our hallowed halls again if while youre here you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community relieved id do that
how would you do that mr
landon shrugs clueless
smiling shall i give you a few ideas
smiling too please
besides attending all your regular classes id like you to help our janitorial staff after school
for the inner satisfaction it will bring
beat saturday mornings id like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school joking im as underprivileged as they are the fact that you attend this school makes you
his tone quiets landon
finally id like you to join the drama club
rehearsals are tuesday and thursday evenings
grumbling id work backstage or something
theyre doing a play for the holidays
when do i get time for me
thats the point
landons not happy but hell work with this
as he heads for the door softer trying to reach him landon none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself
beat some of us remember how your father then you remember more than i do
pushing gum wrappers under a radiator
landon sweeps at the floor during the star club open house
a dozen nerds including jamie sullivan wearing her brown sweater stand at astronomy exhibits
students wander in listen look
answering question saturns degrees to the right of red antares and much brighter
to her small audience she holds up a contraption made from a wire coat hanger
this is a very simple device made from a coat hanger plastic wrap and typewriter correction fluid
does anyone know what it is
no one does
barely audible a star frame
but jamie hears
she regards him a moment then keeps going
this is a star frame
clay and eric enter checking on landon glancing at jamie
a star frame will help you locate stars and planets with your naked eye scoffing setting her up did god create the sun
taking him seriously yes god created the universe and all its physical laws
even einstein said its a miracle that our world is comprehensible if god can do all that why cant he get you a new sweater
landon laughs loudly
members of the club look at him
that was a joke
she can laugh at herself
and she finds landon funny
landon washes up while his mother sets the table
the microwave hums in the b
your father dropped off an extra check
i dont want his money
it could help with a new car i like the car i have
he picks up the envelope with wet hands
without looking inside rips it in half
cynthia smiles quietly happy
enthusiastic preppies richies other do gooders singing karma chameleon
jamie sits in an aisle seat reading not singing
she turns around to look at landon
he rides in the back row staring out the window wearing a sony walkman glum
tops sleeping bag
out the window jefferson high school coming into view
bars on every window chain link fence around the parameter no grass
a big room with tables and chairs but few books
pairs of heads are bent over textbooks and notebooks
landon sits with luis a freshman boy of mixed ethnicity
a geometry text between them
reading so what is the measure of angle x if a and b are similar triangles
luis is lost intimidated
know what similar means
luis looks down at the book as if for the answer then at landon hopeless
he gets up and walks off
landon looks up in disbelief and catches jamie studying him
shes at a nearby table with her student the door swishes shut behind landon as he hops aboard
hes late and heads for the rear bench seat
jamie sitting there
and no vacant seats save next to her
the bus begins to roll
landon lurches forward
the bus is moving through beaufort
landon sits next to jamie
putting a new tape into his sony walkman
his body turned away
shes reading her book
you going to visit harold
what who is she talking about
they let him out of the hospital yesterday
hes in a rest home on oak street
that old man
he goes to my fathers church
he couldve died this your idea of small talk
i dont make small talk obviously
i just wanted to tell you not to give up
sometimes youve got to back into the teaching from somewhere else
if he heard her he makes no sign
she goes back to her book
a long beat then what makes you volunteer
pause want to know why i tutor reading
because growing up books were my world
you dont know me
your book and your brown sweater and your hair
whats more to know
i wear the sweater because im cold
i read because no one talks to me
my hair is my hair
what is it exactly thats bothering you
you dont care what people say
you mean care what you say
im worrying about other things
the moons of jupiter
cant you have a normal conversation
i dont want to have any conversation
good cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person
she reads again
the bus pulls to a stop in front of beaufort high
belinda wearing a neck brace is waiting leaning on her cabriolet
jamie watches landon exit the bus
landon greeting belinda kissing her
landon opens a side door peers in at the drama club
a big space with a stage
garber stands before six geeky boys and a dozen fat girls and jamie
landon reacts this girl actually chooses to be in these places
garber looks up from her papers
were waiting mr
he slides in a row behind the others
leans forward and pokes a boy eddie jones
eddies pimply and talks with his eyes squinched up
whats the play
eddie hands him a photocopied script the rainmaker
the the theres this drought an and a smooth t t alking guy comes and says he can m make rain and the ugly farmers daughter falls for him
i saw the movie
its really g g good it blows
jamie and landon sit in folding chairs reading from scripts
landons wooden showing how lame this is
as starbuck i hope your dreams come true
as lizzie sad they wont
as starbuck believe in yourself and they will
let me ask you lizzie
look in the mirror
are you pretty
landon are you trying to be bad at this
no it just comes naturally
garber taps her script continue
as starbuck its got to be inside you
then one day the mirror will be the eyes of the man who loves you
youll look in that mirror and youll be more than pretty
youll be beautiful
garber eyes landon motions for him to keep going
as starbuck look at me
tell me what you see
as lizzie jamie looks into his eyes
as lizzie is it really me
as starbuck hamming yes
youre youre b b beautiful
hoots and laughter
jamie looks away humiliated
announcing landon will play the role of bill starbuck
groans among the boys
jamie is horrified
so is landon
to garber no way
i cant do it
offstage you can and you will mr
kellys been standing in the wings
warning with all the sincerity and dignity you can muster
everyone stares at landon
landon exits behind all the others
stands under an overhang lights a cigarette angry waiting for a ride
jamie approaches something on her mind
rude youre like this fly buzzing buzzing everywhere this play means a lot to me
snorting this play
i know you dont suck at acting
refusing to take her seriously
behind him the lights go out as the school closes for the night
but you have to make it a big joke because only dorks and dweebies like doing theater what are you going on about
i can judge too
he exhales eyeing her daring her
you dont care about classes or graduating
but you like school because youre popular and you know youll never be on top again
thats deep your act only works with an audience
she walks off toward her fathers old pontiac
the last car in the parking lot
fire trucks rush by on the street below
landons ears twitch
he looks about
no one no ride
he sees the pontiac backing out of a parking spot
landon bangs on the side of her car as she drives past
jamie turns to look at him
landon wet desperate his eyes pleading
insincere we can talk about your helping me with my lines
jamies at the wheel
i know you dont want help
then we both know
beat ill point
he points the way to the taillights of the fire trucks
the wet road glistens
were following fire trucks
duh because thats where the fire is
he fishes in his pocket for a tape
pulls one out
hes searching the dash no cassette player
fire is like a living thing
not like you
she jerks the car across the center lane
driving on the wrong side of the road
he grips the dash
so you agree you need help
headlights looming a car coming
closer and closer
she swings the pontiac back to the right lane
a car zips by in the other direction horn blaring
landon drops his attitude his act
he toys with the glove compartment knob
kellyll make me leave school if i screw up the play
to herself and
he acts like he doesnt hear but hes interested
whats with the friggin numbers
is do something illegal
is befriend an enemy
im an enemy
landon and jamie walk around the fire watching the fire and the firemen
landon is just tolerating her
the reason i got the part
im a little like lizzie
except i dont worry about some man rescuing me
if shes offended she keeps it to herself
you got some kind of list
are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know
maybe a little of both
they both smile
ill take a chance
go for it
its like a to do list but for my life
if you cant imagine the future you wont have one
he lights a cigarette
she reaches for it
joking having a cigarette
she grins and takes a drag
they share the cigarette
so what else is on this list
cajoling you want to tell me
she eyes him not certain shes willing to risk sharing her dreams with him
guessing rudely get very wasted
lose your virginity
correcting spend a year in the peace corps
make a medical discovery contemptuous ambitious
being negatives a lot more work than being positive
like youd know
i do know
pause be two places at once
learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel
eat breakfast with chopsticks
he likes the frivolity of these
she looks away embarrassed
changing subject if you want help with your lines i have two conditions
smiling you have to promise not to fall in love with me
hes certain shes joking
no problem and you have to meet my father
he looks at her like shes crazy to worry about this
fathers love me
reverend sullivan looming tall
ichabod crane in a collar
landon gives a cheery little wave
hes very sweaty
his bike teeters on its kickstand in the b
landon offers his hand
the reverend shakes reluctantly eyeing him closely landons army boots torn jeans dirty t shirt aloof manner
surprised youre in the play
jamie slides out the door
she looks good in jeans and a white t shirt
in the b
landons bike crashes over
he bounds down the porch steps
explaining bike they took my license for days
but nobodys pressing charges
the reverend looks at jamie concerned
landon tries the kickstand then leans the bike against a carefully trimmed bush
not the best place
ill get something for us to drink dont bother
but shes already gone
the reverend gestures toward the open front door
dark and prim with stiff furniture left to fade
landon pokes around then stares at a photo of little girl jamie with her parents
he looks up aware that the reverend is studying him closely
you know our planet would not suffer for one nanosecond if humans died off
but if ants disappeared that would be catastrophic
the reverend waits letting landon suffer the silence
confidence flagging apropos of nothing
so so so so lets get something straight
you dont know me
i dont know you
but i know what youre about
beat keep your distance from this house and from jamie
his eyes lock with landons
his message clear
a noise and jamie is there carrying glasses of lemonade all cheerful
i miss anything
jamie washes the lemonade glasses happy
her father comes in
the carter boy
tell me about him
he wants help with his lines he was driving the car that hit harold keene by accident jamie hes careless
beat is this really the best time to be making a new friend
im supposed to always be alone
i dont want you to see him outside school activities
but i need to start deciding how to spend my time and my life
gentler im sorry your mother isnt here to help you become a woman
dad ive become a woman without her
just not a pretty one
jamie hops out of bed pulls on jeans and a sweatshirt
jamie peers into her fathers room
she tiptoes to the staircase and down
landon is waiting when jamie appears
he has scripts in his back pocket
they smile at each other laugh
re her father i know
dont say anything
hes a softy
got him wrapped around my finger
you think so
she grins skeptical
jamie leads landon toward the cemetery rear gate
people think im strange dont they
because i try to be nice to people
do you think im strange
landons caught off guard by her frankness
but that can be good
jamie quickly scales the fence
landons right after her
why are we here
jamie drops down
takes a flashlight from her bag
cuz its dark and quiet and you can see into another world
on top of gate the world of the dead
being mysterious could be
he drops down not sure what she means
shes already walking away
my mothers buried near here
my fathers alive but its like hes dead
she looks at landon feeling his sorrow then unlocks a storage shed
opens the door
returns a moment later carrying several pieces of an odd looking home made cylindrical device
what is that
proud that is my telescope
the ten inch dobsonian telescope is pointed at the sky
the eye piece is at the end of the long scope the scope rests on a plywood base
landon looks through the eye piece
a beautiful view of a golden planet with a broad flat ring system
before voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings but there are thousands of them made of floating ice
maybe debris from a moon that broke apart
or building blocks for a world that never formed
she looks at him
he smiles embarrassed
im not smart
just a sponge
she smiles disagreeing then looks through the telescope and changes its view
sometimes i come here and just scan the heavens
joking looking for intelligent life
looking for something someone
he doesnt know what to say
do you believe youll see your mother again
i hope so
beat i think maybe she sees me now
their eyes meet
she looks away
changes the subject
re telescope im building a larger one to see the nucleus of haleys comet the dirty snowball at its core
beat im probably not going to be around next time it comes
in years me neither
she likes that he knows a little about astronomy
they each lean back on a tombstone and stare at the stars
youre really into god right
in ten words or less
my relationship with god is my own
but you think about him it her
when you do how do you
landon could joke or he could reveal something
like in a church painting
i see this giant hovering over the ground
hes wearing a robe and has long flowing hair and hes pointing his finger at something
do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do
i know theres a plan for everyone but sometimes i dont understand what the message is or what the point is
there is no point
maybe were not supposed to understand but were supposed to have faith that someone else sees the big picture
you have to believe to have faith
you dont believe in anything
why should i read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles
interpreted by another guy like my father
your father doesnt like me
he doesnt trust you
sometimes i dont even trust me
he sits up and pulls rainmaker scripts from his back pocket
he holds one out to her
a moment passes
she takes it
im not afraid of you
jamie sneaks from the stairs to her room
shuts the door
a light glows under the door then goes out
he opens his eyes listens then turns over and goes back to sleep
landon lies in bed flipping the tv channels past square pegs miami vice mtv to a british nature documentary
after a moment he searches for a pen and paper
titles it life list
he doesnt know what to write
landon clay eric belinda
erics pickup is parked by belindas cabriolet
radios on blasting the same station same song john fogertys rock and roll girls
women are definitely evolving into men
the moustaches on some girls
why is jamie sullivan staring at us
jamies watching them
she wants to jump landons bones
that is so pitiful
shes very confused
shes coming over here
heart be still
they laugh more and shes there
to landon hi
he doesnt respond
she shifts from foot to foot
the plays going to be really good
mocking her im really glad you think so
his friends snicker and guffaw
she looks at them then back to landon
i guess you dont want to practice lines tonight
you guessed right
she gives him a funny look and walks away
a better person than he and he knows it
thats one girl who cant take a hint
because she doesnt know what a hint is
landon the loudest
it feels good but he also feels a little
the camaro is still a dented mess
but landon drops its hood down wipes his hands and climbs behind the wheel
the engine starts
no posters of pop stars
books by houston smith thomas merton alan watts carlos castaneda
jamie studies listening to joni mitchells i wish i had a river
the jamie opens the front door
a stern voice from the living room
better not be the carter boy
jamie shuts the door
landon cant believe this
he presses the bell again
talking to door jamie
beat open up
beat open the door
long beat reverend sullivan i have to talk to your daught what is your problem
shes standing in the front yard
youre not in a very good mood
you dont miss a thing
he steps down off the porch
the plays in a couple of weeks
i was hoping we could run lines together
just not at school
yeah or anywhere where people might see us
belindas a very jealous person
that would be the reason
he thinks she might be going for this
so its like you want to be secret friends
youre reading my mind then maybe you can read mine
she walks up the porch steps goes in the front door and opens it
before she goes in i thought i saw something in you something good
but i was wrong
jamie leans against the closed door trembling almost crying
in the living room her father looks up from his reading sees jamie then parts the curtains looks out glowers
landon standing in the front yard confused that jamie would reject his generous offer of friendship
landon walks to his car then yells back at the parsonage
why do you have to be so weird
the front door opens startling landon
its the reverend
red faced with fury
landon glares back but then climbs in his car and drives off
jamie sits on the sofa
her father doesnt look up from his reading
the first time i met him i knew
im proud of how youre handling yourself
tears well and jamies face cracks with guilt and heartbreak
she leaves before her father can see her distress
landon lies in bed watching another british nature documentary this one on astronomy
he reaches for his school yearbook
flips the pages until he finds jamies photo
shes smiling and looks almost cute
listed under her photo are clubs red cross stars and planets drama
ambition to witness a miracle
landon and luis sit over the geometry text
landon has just asked a question and luis is shrugging sadly
landons eyes wander out the window
lets get outta here
landon and luis face each other across the half court
landons got a ball and is further from the basket
you me and the basket
were the three corners of a triangle
take one step in
landon and luis both step forward
am i at the same angle to you and the basket as before
so what did we just make
a similar triangle
what kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths
make me an isosceles
luis steps outward directly opposite landon
two sides the same
landon tosses him the ball
jamie glances over from a picnic table where she works with her student isabel
landon looks at her she looks away he looks back
but not staring
landon studies the books in the spiritual religion shelf
he picks out a book then sits in a corner
but before he opens the text he looks around him suddenly taking in all the books all the learning all the knowledge that could be his
on the marquee the rainmaker
under this all invited
under this a full parking lot
a full house
parents teachers students churchgoers booster club and rotary members
the set is a wealthy midwestern ranch house of the s
eddie and two other boys play other characters
the plays underway
landon watches dressed as bill starbuck in a nicely fitted suit
waiting for his entrance
the father then why dont you talk to her
as jim because if we do shell think were trying to get rid of her
the father shell sure think the same if i do it
youre her father and comes a time when a fathers gotta mention
from stage right jamie makes her entrance as lizzie
a collective gasp from the audience
jamie wearing makeup a dress that clings her hair pulled back
landon cant take his eyes off her
as lizzie morning pop
i dreamed we had a rain rain coming down in sheets
lightning flashed thunder rolled up and down the canyon like a kid with a big drum
reverend sullivan enraptured
principal kelly hopeful
cynthia carter uncertain
clay eric and belinda rocking in their seats snickering
as lizzie i know why you sent me to sweetriver
six boys in that family
the first three days i stayed in my room
as noah the brother whatd you do that for
a well dressed man dr
jonathan carter landons father slips in and takes a seat a couple of rows behind cynthia
as lizzie i knew what i was there for and they knew it too
carter hangs on every word
others sit on the edge of their seats
even clay eric and belinda
belinda leans forward to take a photo
as she zooms landon and jamie on stage growing larger
landon jamie and the three boys
as starbuck genuine
youll look in that mirror and youll be more than pretty
youll be beautiful
look at me
tell me what you see
she sees something in his eyes she hasnt seen in them before
as lizzie choked up is it really me
jamie her face lovely
her eyes shining radiating looking directly at him
landon is dumbstruck
as starbuck heartfelt yes
beat youre beautiful
landon changes the line and nails it
they both know its sincere
a moment passes
her stomach churns with anticipation
he leans in
she closes her eyes
when jamie opens her eyes they are filled with tears
the curtain crashes down
end of act two
clapping from the other side of the curtain
landon tries to meet jamies gaze
but shes looking at the floor
principal kelly pleased
cynthia carter proud
clay and eric surprised
reverend sullivan frowning concerned
belindas face is cold hard
landon runs out looking for his friends
kelly shakes his hand then deals with parents
belinda getting into her car
landon struggles with what to say
thats what i thought
landon watches her start her car back from a parking space landon
his father is standing on the curb
who invited you
i thought we might get a bite not hungry
landon moves toward his camaro
dont walk away from me
like you walked away from us
landon opens his car door and gets in
landon waits by jamies locker
the bell rings
landon walks along the lunch line looking
many many books
landon cruises the stacks
belinda sitting at a table with a girlfriend sees landon and turns away
he doesnt pursue it
eric and clay watch landon hammer out dents in the camaro
theyre smoking sharing some beers
josh the neighbor kid stands across the street wanting to be invited over
contemptuous shes like some puritan
shes got her own ideas
maybe to you
eric and clay exchange a look is landon defending her
belindas telling everyone that kiss was real
eric and clay smirk in disbelief
and that youre scamming on jamie sullivan
not denying it scammings a strong word
landons waiting when jamie approaches her locker
her hair pulled back
she looks good in a simple fresh way
you werent in school yesterday
i went to the doctor with my father
healthy as can be
she doesnt help him
she opens her locker gets what she needs
you were great the other night
so were you
he tries to touch her hair
i havent been nice to you
youre hardly nice to anyone
sincere im sorry
walking away i wish i could believe you
jamie sits alone reading wearing her old brown sweater
landon walks by clay and eric at a table
puts his tray down on jamies table and sits
making a public statement
people can see
and that would ruin your reputation how
she goes back to her book
re her book whats that
she doesnt look up
shows him the spine the scarlet letter
im reading all the novels on mr
rothbergs best american authors list
how many books are there
annoyed a hundred
then theres his classics list
and his european list
landon realizes this is why shes always reading
that on your life list
to read all those books
she doesnt deny it
he just dives in
maybe i want to try being positive
she looks up
examines his face for the truth
maybe i miss doing that dumb play with you
students seated near them have overheard
maybe you inspire me
that sounds like horseshit
all of it
she picks up her books and tray
everyone is watching
i just did
landon follows jamie out of the building
jamie you lack honor
you lack compassion
you lack honesty
you lack humanity
she heads to the old pontiac
landon jogs after her
maybe some of that is true you dont know the first thing about being someones friend i dont want to be just your friend you dont know what you want
you dont either
take a look at yourself
maybe youre scared that someone might actually like you and why would that scare me
because then you couldnt hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your god
she gets into her car
slams the door
starts the engine
she recognizes the truth
but the real reason youre scared
you like me
she drives off
clay and eric watching guffaw at landons spectacle
if you were really my friends youd be helping me not running me down
the only one running you down is you
landon sits alone
legs dangling over
lighting and dropping matches into the black beyond his feet
his body caught in the occasional sweep of car headlights
nearby an abandoned car
a rusty old yugo
landon comes in from outside
is surprised to find cynthia sipping tea wearing her uniform
out with belinda
i cant know things if you dont tell me
dad came to the play
surprised you saw him
he wanted to get a bite after
i said no
disbelief after he moved out i invited him to every practice every game every parent teacher conference you ever had
he didnt show not once
he wants to show now
you going to let him
you going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to
landon doesnt answer
angry you do that
the door is open to a lab where jamie and the star club is meeting
landon mops working hard while listening in
inside jamie ignores him
kelly watches from near the trophy case
dont wear a hole in that one spot there
landon grins and moves on
behind landons back mr
kelly peeks into the science lab
looks back at landon
landon parks his camaro
its shiny and buffed and perfect again
a christmas party for the tutors and tutored
a rock n roll christmas cd plays
a raffle ticket box by the door
a sign reads win movie tickets
landon enters buys a ticket then takes off his leather jacket
underneath a nice shirt and tie
across the room jamie looking pretty in a dress laughing with her student isabel
kelly talking with mr
reginald adams principal of jefferson high
luis runs over diverts landons attention
adams goes to a microphone
as you all know were here to celebrate the holidays and to raise money to buy books for our library
the book drive is being led by beaufort highs jamie sullivan
this is new
landon looks at jamie whos smiling
she steps to the microphone
thank you for buying tickets
weve raised two hundred and eighty five dollars
she steps down
off to one side
to luis about enough to buy maybe five volumes in a set of encyclopedias
its a start
yeah with a finish in about a decade
he looks at her
so youre talking to me
when i have something to say
whats number one on your list
she shakes her head
my number one would be getting out of beaufort
getting out wont be your problem
itll be figuring out what you want when you get somewhere
she walks away
what does that mean
turning back it means you can do anything
landon smiles not sure why she believes in him
hanging on the front door a simple evergreen wreath with a plaid bow
dark save for a gilded fake tree lit with tiny blinking lights and the glow of cynthias cigarette in the dark
come enjoy the tree
landon comes down the stairs
sits on the sofa
wearing another good shirt
she tries to reach out
you look nice
i should have dressed
youre fine like that mom
theres hot cider in the kitchen
not moving thanks
i havent seen clay or eric lately
no great loss i need to go out
hurt to see your father
i wont be long
he senses her hurt but leaves anyway
a christmas tree with large colored lights stand in a corner
jamie and her father playing cards
the doorbell rings
then urgent banging
recognizing landon carter
landon slides his backpack off his shoulder
pulls out a shopping bag
holds it out to jamie
awkward its a present
she opens the bag pulls out a beautiful pink sweater
without a word just a happy smile landon hops down the steps toward his car
reverend sullivan appears in the doorway
calling back merry christmas
and to all a good night
jamie hums to herself as she brushes her hair
shes wearing the new sweater
her father knocks
whats landon carter up to
innocent up to
i thought we had rid ourselves of his disagreeable companionship
dad why dont you get to the point where you get to the point
why is he giving you a gift
jamie doesnt answer
did you give him a gift
i saw the way he looked at you
the way he kissed you
it was a play
unconvinced boys like him have expectations
i have expectations too
hes feeling her grow up grow away
im not changing the rules
i havent asked you to
they eye each other
hes losing her
a nurse points landon toward a patient room
he carries a battered liquor store box
a tv flickers
landon comes in
opens the box
pulls out the evergreen wreath with the plaid bow
christmas is all about the smells
landon leans the wreath in the window
harold keene the old man from the accident watches from his bed baffled
pines my favorite
that and cider with cloves
landon pulls a thermos from his coat pocket
unscrews the cap
finds a drinking cup
pours in cider
offers harold the cup
who are you
i was driving the car that you
harold takes the cup looks landon over
landon appears genuinely contrite
im very sorry what kind of a man are you son
honest i dont know that i am a man
im working on it
ive worked on it my whole life
harold reaches under his pillow
pulls out a small bottle of liquor
tops off his cider
get yourself a glass
gotta keep my wits for the drive home
harold nods liking landon
youll sit a while
landon speeds the windows open wind whipping dire straits blasting
the camaro turns and brakes and turns again kicking up gravel raising hell
the car slides to a stop
landon turns off the radio
wipes the rearview mirror clean spotless
unties the dangling plastic skeleton and pockets it
colorful banners and flags flap in the brisk wind
landon talks with a used car salesman
its got a new v and transmission
beat twelve hundred
not a scratch anywhere
the interior is reconditioned
be a collectors someday
they look at the camaro
shining in the sun
you cant expect me to pay you for your attachment to that car
landon gazes at another dealership across the street then adopts the surly vaguely threatening attitude of old
i expect you to pay me for yours
the salesman looks from landon to the car
he pulls a wad of cash from his pocket
wearily counts out twelve bills
landon takes the money touches the camaros hood then walks away
the marquee reads happy holidays
an old station wagon
at the parking space a sign school principal only
kelly looks up from paperwork
landon drops a folded wad of hundreds on the desk
for jefferson high
suspicious where did you get
angry its mine to give
i didnt steal it
i didnt say you did
but his tone implied it and landons already gone
kelly is immediately sorry
he goes to his window and sees landon pedal away on the old bike
landon watches a tow truck lower the abandoned yugo
when the car is down he sees jamie standing on the sidewalk
landon faces jamie
i heard what you did
he nods but quickly changes the subject
re the yugo she great or what
why are you doing all this
to impress me
beat but are you impressed
she heads for her fathers old pontiac
new years eve
would you go out with me
but not as a date date
im not allowed to date
she smiles and gets in the car
landon follows signs for the church office
landon looks into the reverends office
reverend sullivan is sitting behind his desk examining legal looking documents and records
he takes his glasses off rubs his eyes
the reverend looks up furrows his brow
can i ask you something
does it have to do with jamie
the reverend makes a small motion and landon enters
landon doesnt sit
id like to take jamie to dinner on new years eve
that wont be possible
he looks back to his papers
end of conversation
im sorry i havent always treated jamie the way i should have
she deserves better
reverend sullivan glances up
as if surprised landon is still there
i care for her
i dont want to see her hurt
i wouldnt do that this week
the reverend looks out the window
a gray day cold bitter stark
he considers his options
have her home by one
and drive carefully
landons under the yugos hood
josh the kid from next door is in the drivers seat
start the engine
josh turns the key
under the hood landon changes something
josh tries the engine again
still no go
landon changes something else
one more time
josh tries one more time
the engine roars then dies then amazingly starts again
landon high fives josh then sees an old station wagon turn in
kelly hands a paper to landon
your grades for fall semester
incredulous you came here to give me my report card
ive seen students with records like yours go to j
for a couple of years then transfer to a good college
landon understands what kelly is implying
id gladly write you a letter of recommendation
they shake hands
landon dressed with care faces the mirror and wet combs his hair
a seafood joint on the waterfront
quaint not fancy
twinkle lights illuminate jamies face
landon finds her lovely
i cant believe you asked my fathers permission
i wanted this to be a date
she watches landon happy then perplexed
landon wolfing down his food
is there a rush
i have to get you home by one
were going somewhere
i didnt ask your father
the cars tonight she comes plays
he belches loudly dramatically
i know you want to
a small burp
bring the air all the way up from your stomach
he belches again
just as loud
she tries again laughing
landon steers the car into a parking lot for a miniature golf course with a castle shaped video arcade and little league diamond
a family entertainment center
jamie sees where they are
before we do this
were doing something
before we do this i just want to say that a good lifes gotta be about more than achieving stuff like on your list
she waits for more
its about working with what you already have right now at your fingertips you know spontaneously
what are you talking about
that little bit of larceny in your heart
jamies in the cage with a helmet on
a machine tosses balls
landon coaches from outside
keep your bat parallel to the ground
jamie is laughing too hard to hit anything
the balls keep coming
she ducks out of the way and grasps the fence and leans in
landon leans in on his side
theyd be embracing if the fence werent there
in the b
kids from their school
landon looks over at them
to jamie lets go
the yugo roars down the asphalt
a sign for the approaching state line whips by
jamie and landon
with stevie nicks talk to me on the the cells in our bodies are always changing
in six or seven years all your cells have changed
you could be like a completely new person from the inside out
that whats happening to you only faster
pulls the car over
he leaps out leaving the headlights on
landon takes jamies hand and pulls her toward some invisible place
where what are we
he keeps tugging her
she follows him
stand right here
he leans down and lifts one of her feet a foot from the other
he notices a large bruise on her leg
she brushes her dress down
youre acting like a crazy person
youre straddling the state line
youre in two places at once
shes thrilled at his solution to her wish
he walks to the shoulder of the road
repeat after me
he does a cartwheel
im gonna teach you
a starry night with a bright moon
glimmering silver water
jamie and landon walk onto a dock
its places like this that make me certain theres a god
surprised youre sometimes not sure
they reach the end of the dock
she turns to face the wind
it blows her hair
she turns his face the same way
its like the wind
i cant see it but i feel it
he closes his eyes
feeling the wind
opens them again rejecting the idea
we can measure wind
uncertainty makes you uncomfortable
what do you actually know with religion
beat quieter love
she tries to avoid implying anything
my mother told me god is love so when youre feeling love youre feeling god
beat i think talking about these things threatens their very beauty and mystery
her tone is matter of fact but landons got a serious and tender look on his face
he touches her hair
almost a whisper i dont understand
maybe youre not supposed to
he moves closer
i might kiss you
she looks down
i might do it wrong
tenderly not possible
he touches her neck her cheek her mouth
then leans in and kisses her
a tender soft kiss
he pulls away
they look at each other a moment
i love you jamie
there he put it out there risked looking and feeling foolish
not the old landon
jamie looks away
happy and sad
gently nows when you say something
overwhelmed i cant
beat i cant explain
she turns back to him her eyes shining
she touches his face and they kiss again deeply
but after a few moments she drops her chin onto his shoulder
smiling glowing even but slightly aloof staring at the water
he pulls away slightly to study her face
he touches her cheek and brings her back from wherever shes been
you make me feel
and less strange
tears run down her cheeks
landon wipes them away with his thumbs attributing them to happiness
landon follows jamie up the steps
the lights in the living room are on
through the windows they can see her father taking down the christmas tree
be very quiet
he pulls her to him
the front door opens
embarrassed hello landon
landon and jamie separate but landon keeps an arm over her shoulder
reverend sullivan studies the two young people
whispers to jamie happy new year
and he goes
jamie walks by her father and into the house
not saying anything
he watches her
what has he allowed
landon and jamie head into school
landon nods to belinda others
they glare back
to belinda and others whats your damage
landon and jamie arrive at his locker
its been kicked in
this happen to you
twice a year
bang bang bang
landon kicks in every locker in his row
a dozen in all
jamie watches a little frightened by his anger
but then he turns to her and grins
now they all match
landon eats alone ignored by eric and clay
jamie approaches with her tray red faced tearful
she hesitates about sitting feeling bad that landons being diminished ostracized
she thinks he doesnt see her
but as she turns to leave he pulls a chair out for her and smiles
landon sees her face
choked up the challenger exploded
principal kellys about to make an announcement
the public address system crackles
landon takes jamies hand as the room hushes
away from here
landon leads jamie up round and round to the top of the tall steel tower
they exit the staircase to a small degree overlook
jamies amazed at the view
how do you know this place
before the divorce
my father used to take me here
fire spotting was his summer job
they look off to the curve of the horizon where sea meets sky
from here he proved to me the earth isnt flat
beat on rainy days wed be above the clouds
what would you do up here
he pulls a deck of cards from his jacket pocket
they sit and he starts to shuffle
not too well
jamie takes the deck
shuffles like a card shark
jamie is already waiting when landons yugo pulls up
he gets out walks to her they kiss
whatd you tell your father
i just left you out of it
she climbs up and over the wall
jamie fits the pieces of her telescope together
when did you build this
i was twelve
landon shakes his head amazed
its not that complicated
landon doubts this
its an alt azimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one
wheres the one youre building
in my back yard
pause embarrassed i lied before
its hardly started
but when its done it will have twice the power of this one wait back up
he grins loving her even more
so what do you want to see
mars doesnt rise until he opens his backpack
pulls out the contents
a thermos of hot coffee
you planned this
hoped for it
are you trying to seduce me
are you seducible
firm but smiling no
thats what i thought
he reaches back into his backpack
pulls out a second blanket
ergo a second blanket
one for me one for you
he hands her one
she takes it smiling reassured
slightly embarrassed what about your father
im always home by midnight and hes always asleep
reverend sullivan sits up in bed
his feet find slippers on the floor
reverend sullivan wearing a robe enters quietly
checking on his daughter
her bed is empty
the old pontiac slows
reverend sullivan looks down the access road to the rear cemetery gate
the yugo parked by the gate
the reverend struggles with what to do
after a moment he decides not to interfere hell pick his moment
he keeps driving
jamie and landon are looking at the heavens through the telescope
in virgo but its about times too faint to see
whats the best thing i can see tonight
he draws her close they kiss
she shyly pulls away
their hands still touching until she looks again into the telescope eyepiece
the second best thing is jupiter
she swivels the telescope into position for jupiter and steps aside so he can look
but he picks up the flashlight pulls a diagram from his pocket
can you locate xxi i
she takes the diagram studies it and adjusts the scope
why am i looking at this star
because i had it named for you
i know its not an official designation she couldnt be happier
she reaches for his hand
i love you
its the first time hes heard it
he pulls her into his arms
she starts to object
respecting her boundaries okay
and he does
silence then whats number one
very shy in april when the dogwoods and wisteria are blooming
he doesnt make fun
he strokes her hair
kisses her forehead
landon enters from outside
cynthia still in her waitress uniform is sitting at the table drinking coffee
a late night or an early morning
honest late night
smart aleck you
were you with jamie
you sleeping with her
landon doesnt dignify this question with an answer
i was cleaning yesterday
i found this
she pulls landons life list from her pocket
landon is horrified
she reads it
touch a moon rock
learn to read egyptian hieroglyphs
go to college
pause she talking to you bout this stuff
landon doesnt answer
she puts the list on the table
honey some of this is
you take after me
people skills and common sense
good dependable qualities
i could take after dad too
youre handsome and charming
i meant hes a doctor
thats eight years of school and training after college
and all that doesnt necessarily make you a better human being
i could do it if i tried
even kelly thinks so
thatd be something
she doesnt want to discourage him but she wants him to be practical and realistic
but if it doesnt happen grab for something within reach
lifes tough enough without causing yourself disappointment angry now whatever my life is im going to be friggin sure im never disappointed honest disappointment isnt something anyone plans for
quieter it catches you by surprise
they are both sorry to have raised their voices
have i told you how proud i am of you
but what i want is for me to be proud of me
landon eats dinner with jamie and reverend sullivan
silence then landon
youre not the quiet type
so talk to us about something
like what sir
landon searches his mind for just the right subject
how about your family
beat my grandfather
when he was seven he shook the hand of an old guy a war vet or something who had once shaken president lincolns hand
pause made a big impression on him
reverend sullivan looks at his daughter
shes nodding interested
my cousin mike
hes from a big family
hes the fifth kid
he heard that every fifth child in the world is chinese
so he thought he was
we didnt tell him any different for years getting to the point your parents are divorced
since i was five
my moms a cocktail waitress
how do you the two of you get by
materially or spiritually
honest i dont know
we used to try to believe in each other
his eyes meet the reverends
the reverends got to respect him some
reverend sullivan looks out the window into the back yard
jamie showing landon the junk pile that will become her newer larger telescope
they are laughing jostling each other comfortable happy
reverend sullivan and jamie put the dishes away
you and the carter boy
want to catch me up on recent developments
youre asking if were involved
im asking how much
dad its time to tell him
pause it would be the right thing
she turns to him upset
her anger spilling out
but thats not the real reason
you think if i tell hell disappear and thats what you want
me all to yourself
calm stung no
i want whats best for you
this him landon is whats best for me
youre sure you can trust him
hes playing to her old insecurities
shes not one hundred percent sure
gentler isnt it better to know
their eyes meet
she knows hes right
ferris buellers day off and three amigos
on the marquee
landon and jamie exit as belinda and a new boyfriend buy tickets
clay and eric and a crowd behind them
she takes her boyfriends arm turns away snubbing him
eric says something inaudible and the whole crowd sniggers and laughs
hes become landon
landon reddens now realizing for certain that hes become a jamie sullivan
landon and jamie walk
the theater in the b
re his status from citizen high to citizen low
i dont care
care but just dont let it get to you
it gives them power
that what you do
i try to keep my power
hes impressed with how she manages
one of your secrets
serious yes one of many
he doesnt notice her tone
whitney houstons how will i know
on the radio
jamie flips the radio off
shes got something on her mind
landon notices only that she seems a bit remote
youre worried about your college applications
im not applying to college
stunned but you said no you assumed
he looks at her questioning
shes looking out her window
youre going to take a year off
join the peace corps
what are you going to
tears are running down her face
he pulls the car over
jamie gets out of the car
landon quickly follows
jamie im sick
then ill take you home
youll feel better tomorrow
he tries to take her arm
she shakes off his hand steps back
wanting to be heard and understood
im sick with leukemia
landon tries to say something
nothing comes out
his soul numb
i found out last winter
im not responding to treatment anymore
his face crumples with pain and anguish
why didnt you tell me
the doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible
pause i didnt want anyone being weird around me
long beat god gives me an illness then you
a cruel joke
she gets in the car
slams her door shut
he stands there not knowing what to do
landon pulls up in front of jamies house
a long quiet ride
im not letting you die
jamie just looks at him
feeling sorry for him what he wants doesnt matter
the reverend and landon drink coffee
its her decision and shes decided not to tell people at least for now
how how long does she have
two three months
so youve given up
reverend sullivan hears the challenge in his voice
her doctors have
jamie and i
were still praying for a miracle
weve lived with this for over a year now and
if there is a god how could he let this happen
its a long answer and by the time the reverend opens his mouth to explain landons out the door
the yugo rips down the road
landon opens a map over the steering wheel
turns on the dome light
looks at the return address on an old letter
landons yugo winds through city streets
the yugo slows as landon leans forward to read a street sign
his face is tear streaked
he flicks his headlights to bright then low again
the car turns left
large new colonial
landon slams his car door and stands in the street
staring at his fathers house
he heads up a flagstone path for the front door
landon rings the resounding ding dong bell then bangs on the heavy wood door
i have to talk to you
elegant thick carpets
carter putting on his robe parts the silk drapes in the upstairs hall
his son standing on the front lawn
open the door
landon backs away from the house
angrily kicks over a decorative planter
is halfway to his car when dr
carter opens the door and comes out
landon doesnt hear
landon turns around
sees his father
breaks down sobbing
his father goes to him
hugs him a big bear hug
you have to save her
is your mother all right
lights pop upstairs
its jamie my girlfriend she has cancer you have to come look at her right now
calm trying to diffuse its the middle of the night i dont give a shit what time it is
landon pulls away
landon im a cardiologist not an oncologist
youre a doctor arent you
he waves his father off dismissing him
ill look into it
but landon hasnt heard
hes in his car
carter watches his sons car move away regretful
landon quietly shuts the back door
starts making coffee
your father called
jamies a patient at his hospital
hes having a colleague look at her chart this morning
i didnt know
i didnt know either
the yugo parked in the driveway
the morning paper lying on the grass
landon paces in front of the front porch
incapable of ringing the bell lacking the courage lacking the right words
upstairs the curtains move
jamie looks out the window
landon pacing talking to himself
she starts to raise the window to say something to help him but then lets the curtain drop
she needs for him to decide for him to be ready to face this with her
the sound of a car
she looks out the window again
the yugo driving away
landon lies on his bed in the dark
the phone rings
landon stares at his extension
the ringing stops
a voice from downstairs
its your father
landon picks up his phone
the door to landons room is ajar
cynthia waits outside
she pushes the door open
landon sitting on his bed
he cant do anything
cynthia is pained to see his suffering
if its incurable i told him to leave me alone
landon re jamie it was the only thing ive ever asked him
landons still in bed
facing the wall
enters with a plate of food
i brought some dinner
she leaves the tray and goes
jamie and her father eat dinner
jamie is red eyed heartbroken
not sure at all hell call
i wanted to think hed changed
angry no you didnt
beat but he did change
just not enough
jamie youre not mad at me
youre mad at landon furious i am mad at you
and at landon
and the universe
quieter i dont even know where to put all my anger
god accepts your anger
he wont punish you
by making me ill he is punishing me
quieter i just dont know what for
she flees the room
goes up the stairs
up another flight to the attic
jamie opens a closet door
pulls out a dress a scarf jewelry a worn book her mothers belongings
she opens the book and starts to weep
missing her mother
reverend sullivan stands looking up at the attic stairs
frustrated angry worried
landon is still in bed
pulls back the curtains
yanks up the shades
i dont care if you dont leave the house
but you have to get out of bed
landon sits at the kitchen table
cynthia pours him a cup of coffee
you and i may not be communicating very well right now
but let me be clear
dont make this about you
its about her
her words sink in
i have no idea what to say
how to act
what if i do the wrong thing
gently be yourself and i dont think there is a wrong thing
beat let jamie take the lead
shell let you know what she needs
before landon can ring the bell the front door opens
landon runs past him into the house
where you should be
deserted classes are meeting
landon runs sliding to a stop at one classroom door
looks in keeps going stops at another
this is jamies pov from the top of the hallway
she stands holding her books watching him unsure
finally feels her gaze turns to look
turns away still angry and disappointed
runs to her
he catches up to her
face each other
neither sure what to say
im so sorry
im a coward
i should have told you sooner guilt ridden i made you do too many things kept you up all night no
the drugs just stopped working
if anything doing things i love kept me healthy longer
are you frightened
all the time
beat i feel like i have no one
she means not even god and he gets this
you have me
he hugs her close rocking her comforting her and himself
help me live until i die
a small group of students sit on stage reading from our town rehearsing
jamie and landon sit together in the third row holding hands
landon glances at her realizes shes asleep
pulls her sweater over her
landon sits with luis jamie at the next table with isabel
she looks pale
he catches her eye
they both smile a little sadly then turn back to their students
landon drives them home from jefferson high
theyre going to build a tunnel under the english channel
theyre calling it the chunnel
anything you want
he reaches into a cooler on the floor of the back seat
you like yogurt
i used to like yogurt
he places a red heart shaped box in her lap
apologetic not very original
happy valentines day
she looks crestfallen feels terrible
i didnt even think about it
he takes a chocolate
pops it in his mouth
you gave me a chocolate
pull back to reveal
jamie and landon are looking at stars
a long quiet moment
what are you thinking
honest that i want you to take me home
we just i dont want to come here anymore
she begins taking the telescope apart
jamie looks at the high fence weary then reaches into a pocket for a key
unlocks the gate
swings the gate open
you have a key
ive just never needed it
pause will you talk to my father
ive talked to your father
thats what i mean
their eyes meet
her look is serious
reverend sullivan is up a ladder
cleaning a gutter
landon stands below a few feet away gathering his nerve
he walks over
the reverend is busy ignoring landon standing below
a long beat then
calling up sir
being ignored is beginning to feel preferable to being noticed
the reverend looks down
ill be honest
i dont know if i can pray but i can do just about anything else
neither landon nor the reverend see jamie come out of the house and walk over
landon shields his eyes with a hand to see the reverend better
whatever you need
whatever jamie needs
beat i could start by driving her to school im not going back to school
landon and her father both turn to her
they understand what she is saying
you can tell anyone you want
i dont care
she goes into the house
landon and reverend sullivan look at each other then away uncomfortable
that didnt sound like her
landon looking haggard moves slowly as he cleans out jamies locker
students stare as he carefully places her things including the pink sweater in a shopping bag
they part and hush as he passes by
news travels fast
clay and eric step forward
we heard bout jamie sullivan
she fierce say nothing
nothing bout her
misunderstood genuine no
were sorry man
landon turns back
no one speaks
too late and not enough
he pushes past belindas new boyfriend heading for the office
kelly and landon
i know it means not graduating but i need to be excused from all school acti youre excused
landon heads for the door
how is she
landon cant answer
you will graduate
landon looks up astounded
if i have to tutor you myself
landon nods accepting appreciative
landon puts away the contents of the shopping bag
jamies in bed wearing the sweater
yesterday i felt sick horrible
today i feel like riding my bike
he turns on the clock radio next to her bed
finds a waltz
offers his hand
pulls her out of bed
shes in pajamas
you know how to waltz
bashful i was going to fake it
i always fake it
so they waltz faking stumbling and laughing holding each other
reverend sullivan hears the music and laughter
he frowns afraid for jamies health
jamie grips landons arms seems to slip suddenly too exhausted to carry her weight
landon picks her up gently carries her back to bed
settles her in
how you doing
landon sits on her bed
strokes her hair
they look at each other
landon reaches for her hand
when he looks at her face again shes asleep
landons sitting on his childhood tree swing twisting side to side
his mother comes out of the house
time seems to be slowing down and speeding up at the same time
she reaches to put a hand on his shoulder
he lets her
the rear gate is open
a caretaker waits while landon carries pieces of the older telescope to his car
a tall pile of parts is already at his car
eric and clay drive up in erics pickup
eric and clay spy landon
landon freezes not sure what to expect
the truck makes a circle around landon then stops
the music quiets
eric and clay jump down
a long tense moment then hey
without a word clay walks to the yugo lifts the heaviest telescope part and carries it to the bed of the pickup
eric follows suit
landon studies the pieces of the smaller telescope and how they fit together
they are like a map for how to build the bigger one
landon unloads an impossibly large round cardboard concrete form tube from his car
carries it around the house toward the back yard
jamie wakes from a nap
she looks thinner grayer
she hears hammering
she hauls herself up and to a window
landon working on the new telescope
he looks up at her window
sees her there
reverend sullivan comes in to check on jamie
shes standing at the window
whats that boy doing
she turns to look at him and collapses into his arms
jamie lies in bed eyes closed
hooked to monitors pumps an iv drip
landon holding her hand
reverend sullivan talks quietly with a doctor
hearing bad news
the sky is pink
a squirrel runs along a telephone wire
the yugo is the only car in the visitor lot
landon in yesterdays clothes dozes lightly
jamie moves and he starts fully awake
she opens her eyes
closes her eyes again
he rests his head on her shoulder and weeps
her eyes open then close again
theres nothing to say
reverend sullivan looks through the window in the door at the scene within
he hesitates then pushes the door open
reverend sullivan enters
you go on home
im not tired
i need to be with her
theres only one chair
landon nods and goes
the reverend sits closes his eyes a moment
when he opens them shes looking at him
he kisses her forehead then sits back
jamie god is not punishing you
no god i know wants anyone to be sick or feel pain or suffer
when mom died you told me god wanted her more loved her more i was wrong
nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did
not even god
he lets this sink in
god loaned you to me entrusted you to my care
im failing you
she looks away agreeing without saying so
i make you the same promise that god does
beat i will always be with you
she sits up and embraces him
he wraps his arms around her
she closes her eyes tears welling never wanting to let him go
on the marquee on the front lawn welcome haleys comet
the yugo parks in the b
landon picks up a pile of books and assignments
looks through them then eyes miss tarbox
wheres jamies book
thats everything mr
kelly gave me
insistent the next book on that list
the old man and
i need it today
kelly steps out of his inner office
sees landons anguished face his exhaustion
ill drive a copy over to her
landon nods his appreciation
jamie looks smaller
her eyes have blue circles beneath
the hemingway novel on the bedstand
belinda pushes the door open
not sure she is welcome
landon is sitting in a chair
he sees her motions for her to come in
ill tell her you were here
give her this okay
she hands landon a small photo album
pictures from the play
jamie looks pretty im sorry about how we conciliatory no
youre with who you should be
its like she chose you
agreeing and i have no idea why
she hugs him quickly then leaves
landon goes to the window looks out
the sky is grayer darker
landon is still at the window
he goes to her side
he kisses her
i have something for you
she reaches under her pillow for the worn book from the attic
she offers it to landon
smiling dont worry
its not a bible
he takes it
my mother made it for me before i was born
beat its got quotes from famous people
her favorite lines from books
landon looks at a page
reading what is a friend
a single soul dwelling in two bodies
reading find out who you are and do it on purpose
a bookmark falls out
he studies that page a moment
landon reads it
love is always patient and kind
it is never boastful or conceited that was read at my parents wedding
he takes her hand
howre you doing
looking away better
i was really angry
its gone now
gently because you have hope that youll get better
pause shrugging accepting maybe i believe god has a bigger dream for me than i had for myself
beat maybe i believe the journey the big adventure never ends
he kneels on the floor
puts his head on her pillow next to hers
maybe i believe god sent you to me because i am ill
to help me through
he touches her face tenderly
almost whispering i want to go home
he gets her meaning
trying not to break ill talk to your father
looking away its not that simple
pause it costs money to do this at home
cynthia pacing talking on the phone worried
the front door is wide open
into phone he doesnt talk to me maybe not to anyone except jamie
she stands in the doorway and looks out
landon in his car in the driveway
landon just sits
into phone ive never asked you for extra
but we need it now
as soon as possible
jamies breathing is shallower
landons reading her the sheltering sky
he pauses looks up
isabel jamies student is standing in the doorway
jamie sees her too
she smiles weakly
isabel comes in
landon offers her the book
she takes it and keeps going from where landon left off
stumbling but reading
whos been working with you
isabel looks shyly at landon
jamie shakes her head amazed
landon nods to isabel and she begins reading again
landon quietly opens the back door to the kitchen
cynthia sits at the table with dr
carter his father
sit with us a minute
landon enters but doesnt sit
to his father what are you doing here
he wants to talk to you
to his mother now its okay
you have two parents
were both here for you even even if were not here for each other anymore
landon is listening
i want to do this
please let me
he holds out a check
for a lot of money
landon takes it
quietly to both parents thank you
a smaller jamie lies in a hospital bed seemingly asleep
hooked to an iv
bottles of pills
landon dozes in a comfortable chair
a nurse sits in a corner reading
eric and clay stand in the doorway not sure what to do
jamie opens her eyes smiles
dont wake landon
they tiptoe in
stand on either side of her bed
do i look scary
not too bad
you all right
a dumb question but she handles it well
smiling things could be better
we thought youd be asleep trying to help i dont know what to say either
clay hands her an envelope
what is it
she pulls out a stack of worn bills
for the book drive
landon told us about it we told everyone at school
jamie takes their hands holds them
thanking them silently
her eyes shining with tears
landon sits at his desk sketching the larger telescope making a few computations
a library book on haleys comet is open
a stack of similar books by his elbow
cynthia enters wearing her waitressing outfit
what can i do
tears fill his eyes
everythings being done but its not enough
i have to find something more
gently landon honey
theres nothing more
i dont mean about jamie being sick
i mean about jamie and me
be with her when she wants
make sure she never feels alone
landon thinks his mother is also talking about herself
mom im not going anywhere
not yet anyway
when you are ready i want you to feel free to go
landon opens jamies mothers book
a photo of jamie falls out one taken by belinda
jamie beautiful smiling at the audience
considers the photo finds a page to tuck it into
for landon above some underlined text a psalm from the bible
reading aloud i cry to you my lord my rock
do not be deaf to me for if you are silent i shall go down to the pit like the rest
hear my voice raised in petition as i cry to you for help as i raise my hands my lord toward your holy of holies
landon knows jamie underlined this for him
landon tears down the steps
past his mother to the front door
hes out the door before she even turns around
reverend sullivan sits up in bed
his feet find slippers on the floor
he looks haggard his hair thinner his face defeated
the reverend wearing his robe checks on his sleeping daughter
the night nurse nods as he tucks in blankets
reverend sullivan goes to the window
parts the drapes
a dozen flashlights in a big circle
landon in the middle working feverishly on the new telescope
the back porch light comes on
reverend sullivan steps out onto the back porch
landon looks up
flushes almost manic i have to finish it tonight
without a word the reverend turns around and goes back inside
leaving the porch light on
landon goes back to work
reverend sullivan comes out
he carries two mugs of coffee and a brightly burning kerosene camp lantern
he walks over sets down the lantern hands landon a mug
ready to work
ive almost finished the rocker
did she order mirrors
as they walk to the garage
you have materials for the side bearings
im using an old phonographic turntable
for the focuser
a chrome plated brass pipe from a drain line
the reverend nods impressed
he yanks the garage door up
you know about this stuff
i helped jamie with the first one
surprised i thought she built it herself
but hardly anyone does anything truly alone
the reverend carries out a large cardboard postal package
landon takes it as the reverend lowers the garage door
serious i need to do this alone
reverend sullivan searches landons face for a long moment understanding then turns and heads for the back door
landon stands in the doorway
the reverend is wiping his glasses his face maybe of tears
he sees landon
a few minutes ago
i have to ask you something
when i was seventeen i was sent up for a year for stealing a car
beat sometimes i still feel that boy inside me and i dont like him
beat but i like you
the reverend stands offers landon his hand
landon takes it
the two men shake
jamie opens her eyes
but can barely keep them open
groggy from pain medication
landons standing there
showered clean clothes
were going out
he starts helping the nurse disconnect her iv
can i go out
youll be fine for a few minutes
jamie looks at the nurse
the nurse nods
landon carries jamie out a large attic window
the finished large telescope is set up
pointing at the sky
shes in her nightgown wrapped in a blanket
grateful touching it its beautiful
but she looks at the lights of the house and streets around them
i dont know what well be able to see
help me stand
he checks his watch
wait a sec
as she turns to him questioning the neighborhood suddenly darkens as the street lamps and lights in every nearby house are switched off
neighbors step outside
hold up binoculars
members of the star club and other students look through traditional telescopes
jamie hugs landon in gratitude
we have five minutes
jamie tears streaming braces herself against landon and she peers into the telescope eyepiece
she pulls back wipes her eyes then looks again
she swings the telescope into the correct position
haleys comet its icy nucleus issuing the jets and streamers of gas dust and debris that form the comets hazy head and long tail
the comet of the century
she steps back so he can see
he looks quickly then moves aside so she can keep looking
shes completely engrossed
a long quiet moment then you love me
she leans away from the eyepiece and looks at him yes
will you do something for me
i cant even do for myself
but if you could you would
his throat tightens with nervousness with hope fear sadness and love
will you marry me
illness happiness disbelief
a sea of pink purple and white blossoms
dogwoods wisteria azaleas and roses blooming
bursting with everyone who knows jamie and landon every kid in their high school including eric clay belinda teachers including ms
kelly luis and isabel and others from jefferson high her fathers congregation cynthia carter dr
carters new wife and their two kids neighbors hospital staff and home nurses
landon stands with his father by the altar
the wedding march begins
the double doors at the back of the church open
everyone turns to look at the bride
gasps of joy and sadness
flanked by a nurse and reverend sullivan
shes wearing her lizzie dress from the play
it hangs loosely but still becomes her
shes a beautiful bride
landon swells with pride
then leaning on her father she slowly makes her way down the aisle
in the pews few dry eyes follow her
jamie halfway stops to rest and catch her breath
a moment later she and her father continue
a long difficult walk
a walk to remember
the nurse rolls a wheelchair up as jamie and her father near
applause breaks out as jamie reaches landons side
landon kneels to be the same height as jamie in her chair
showing solidarity with his son
reverend sullivan standing leans down to kiss jamies cheek
trying to keep his emotions in check
reverend sullivan towering over them
reverend sullivan kneels too
jamie takes landons hand in her right hand her fathers hand in her left
linking the three together
the congregation silences
reverend sullivan looks up from his bible
as a father im supposed to give away my daughter
but i can no more give jamie away than i can give away my heart
but i can let another share in the joy she has given me
may gods blessings be with you both
he reaches out offering a hand to landon
completing the circle
landon repeat after me
do you take
as words are spoken and vows and rings exchanged the camera moves across the faces of those at the altar jamie landon dr
to the first row of the congregation cynthia carter josh eric clay
then back row by row as the reverend begins reading a passage from the book jamies mother made for her
his voice soft and melodious like a poet reading his own work
love is always patient and kind
it is never jealous
love is never boastful or conceited
it is never rude or selfish
it does not take offense and is not resentful
love takes no pleasure in other peoples sins but delights in the truth
it is always ready to excuse to trust to hope and to endure whatever comes
and the camera moves out the double doors to find
in a different season
up the front steps and into
as it is now in present day
the nurse disappears leaving landon carter waiting
looking at a framed photo of jamie as lizzie in the rainmaker
the nurse returns helping an old man as he shuffles in
hes stooped thin balding
his skin parchment thin
the two men embrace
stiff uncomfortable uncertain
youve been well
why is he here
the reverend waits
fumbling im im returning something
he twists the ring on his finger
this belongs to you
he gives his wedding ring to the reverend
landon searches for something meaningful to say
she taught me everything
she saved my life
the reverend turns away overcome with sadness
realizing now why landon has come
youre marrying again
jamie wanted that
she told me
landon is grateful to know this
he makes a move to go
then turns back
im sorry she never got her miracle
it was you
landon deeply touched embraces the old man again
two men still grieving saying good bye
jamie once said when youre feeling love youre also feeling god
landon walks alone
his hair and clothing tousled by a steady gentle wind
she made me a believer
in the journey that never ends
faces the wind
lets the air swirl over him
and in the mystery of all things you cant see but feel everywhere around you
he closes his eyes
