the perks of being a wallflower written by stephen chbosky final draft the titles begin over black
we hear the sound of an old typewriter
someone reaching out to us
the bell dings announcing the end of a line and we see our title
music begins picture fades up and we are in the city
looking out of the back window like a child in the back of a station wagon
we see lights on buildings and everything that makes us wonder
we see the bridge
and the river below
and then we enter
we keep moving backwards watching the lights
golden alive and hypnotic
the music carries us as we float out of the tunnel
onto another bridge
and over the highway
we move into the night sky back through the trees through a window and into
it is a neat and tidy little room
few posters or books
he is innocent hopeful awkward and likable to everyone but his classmates
he sits at his desk writing a letter in pencil as he tapes the title song through the radio on his cassette boom box
dear friend i am writing to you because she said you listen and understand and didnt try to sleep with that person at that party even though you could have
please dont try to figure out who she is because then you might figure out who i am and i dont want you to do that
i just need to know that people like you exist
like if you met me you wouldnt think i was the weird kid who spent time in the hospital
and i wouldnt make you nervous
charlie anxiously walks through the hallway of his suburban split level house
i hope its okay for me to think that
you see i havent really talked to anyone outside of my family all summer
charlie moves to the living room where dad watches a football game
mom reads a page turner and sips her white wine
charlie waits for them to notice him
charlie sits at his desk continuing his letter in pencil
but tomorrow is my first day of high school ever and i really need to turn things around this year
hopeful so i have a plan
we see it in charlies mind
slow motion and wondrous
the kids clear out their lockers by throwing their old papers in the air like a new york confetti parade
as i enter the school for the first time i will visualize what it will be like on the last day of my senior year
charlie walks down the hall
unfortunately i counted and thats
the bell rings and we see the chaotic maze from charlies pov
a senior bully leads the ritual making dozens of freshmen hop down the hall
hop freshman toads
move it boys
as seniors grab more victims charlie moves to the wall
days from now
varsity football players pass wearing their letter jackets
man you got big
worked out all summer
rock hard dude
at the front of the pack is brad hays the quarterback
hes good looking charismatic and friendly
the big man on campus
nice guy too
would you guys get a room
charlie turns to the trophy case to avoid them
trying to make himself as small as possible
trying to be optimistic just days
charlie moves down the lunch line with his sister
candace kelmeckis is and a beautiful type a straight a priss
in the meantime id hoped that my sister candace and her boyfriend derek would have let me eat lunch with their earth club
barks to derek what are you doing with a plastic spork
candace turns to her boyfriend derek
derek is such a pussy the most masculine thing about him is his pony tail
i dont want to bring back silverware derek youre earth club treasurer
derek takes the silverware like a beaten dog
charlie watches them move into the intimidating cafeteria
charlie sits in the corner alone observing everyone having a great time with their friends
he sees a pretty girl with blonde hair having the best first day
this is susan
when my sister said no i thought maybe my old friend susan would want to have lunch with me
charlie catches her eye and waves but she looks away
in middle school susan was very fun to be around but now she doesnt like to say hi to me anymore
charlie turns his attention to the quarterback brad hays
and then theres brad hays whos the quarterback of our team
before my brother went to play football for penn state he and brad played together
so i thought maybe hed say hi to me
but brads a senior and im me so
who am i kidding
brad catches charlie staring at him
charlie sits by himself watching the freshmen boys laugh as a senior paints a goatee on his face with a grease pencil
on the bright side one senior decided to make fun of the teacher instead of the freshmen
he even drew on mr
callahans legendary goatee with a grease pencil
meet patrick full of confidence mischief and so over high school
he is the class clown performing a perfect imitation of the teacher mr
boys the prick punch is not a toy
i learned that in nam back in
callahan the sergeant said put down that prick punch and go kill some gooks
the laughter suddenly dies as the real mr
callahan walks up behind the oblivious patrick
but you know what happened
that prick punch killed my best friend in a saigon whorehouse
patrick suddenly feels mr
callahan behind him
i heard you were going to be in my class
are you proud being a senior taking freshman shop patty cakes
my name is patrick
you call me patrick or you call me nothing
the class laughs
he watches patrick take the long walk back to his seat
i felt really bad for patrick
he wasnt saying the impersonation to be mean or anything
he was just trying to make us freshmen feel better
everyone open your safety guides
why dont you read first
patrick opens the book
surviving your fascist shop teacher who needs to put kids down to feel big
to the class oh wow
this is useful guys
we should read on
he loves him already
the kids pass back paperback copies of to kill a mockingbird
charlie opens his trapper keeper takes a pencil out of the plastic pouch and writes
my last class of the day is advanced english and im excited to finally start learning with the smartest kids in the school
a smart ass freshman girl with braces smiles at him
whispers nice trapper keeper faggot
the kids around him laugh
charlies ears turn red
at the blackboard the teacher writes his name
but you can call him bill
bill is an idealist
and thanks to teach for america im going to be your teacher for freshman english
this semester were going to be learning harper lees to kill a mockingbird
now who wants to get out of the first pop quiz
all hands go up
bill paces the rows
you can skip the quiz if you tell me which author invented the paperback book
as kids think bill confiscates contraband removes hats
he also invented the serial
in fact at the end of chapter of his first novel he had a man hanging off a cliff by his fingernails
hence the term cliffhanger
thats a great guess but no shakespeare didnt write novels
off their silence the author was
bill is about to give the answer when he notices charlie has already written
however if you and i had gone to a play in shakespeares time it would have cost pennies
can you imagine that
we would have put those pennies in a metal box which the ushers would lock in the office
and thats where we get the term
charlie writes down box office then looks up to find that bill is staring at him
waiting for him to raise his hand
ill give you a free a on anything but the final term paper if you get it right
charlie looks down
hes not going to answer
the kids groan
they should have known
charlie smiles to himself
hes going to like this class
the bell rings
the students chatter their way out of class
the last to leave is charlie
you should learn to participate
charlie stops and turns to find bill erasing the board
why didnt you raise your hand
off charlies shrug they call you teachers pet
off charlies nod i used to get spaz
i mean come on spaz
bill takes a moment
so i heard you had a tough time last year
but they say if you make one friend on your first day youre doing okay
thank you sir but if my english teacher is the only friend i make today that would be sort of depressing
i could see that
dont worry mr
bill nods and watches charlie exit
he gets swallowed up by the hallway as the bell rings
charlie looks through the thick office glass
he sees patrick use his charms on mrs
small the principal
small i would happily not take shop
out of nowhere the senior bully grabs charlies book
hey freshman toad
the bully rips the cover
he throws it on the ground as his friends laugh and disappear down the hall
charlie walks up and picks up his book
well i have days to go
and just so i say it to someone high school is even worse than middle school
charlie walks up the path to his house
if my parents ask me about it i probably wont tell them the truth because i dont want them to worry that i might get bad again
charlie tapes his book cover back together
he looks up as his dad comes home from a long day
charlies mom hugs him
if my aunt helen were still here i could talk to her
and i know she would understand how i am both happy and sad and im still trying to figure out how that could be
i just hope i make a friend soon
love always charlie
charlie stands in the kitchen pouring his milk
charlie come on
his family is seated around the table
candaces boyfriend derek is their special guest
this chicken paprikash is delicious mrs
charlies father rolls his eyes then reads his sports page
thank you derek
its charlies favorite
he was a little nervous about starting high school so i made it
you feel a little silly being nervous now huh champ
i sure do
charlie carries his milk back to the table
he quickly sits hoping someone will change the subject
i told you
just give em a smile and be yourself
thats how you make friends in the real world
youre cruisin for a bruisin
freshman year is tough but you really find yourself
deep eye roll thanks derek
charlies father and mother watch a local sports show
charlie passes by them with ice cream on his way downstairs
i think you could be a little nicer to derek
the kids a pussy
i cant stand him
charlie moves to the entry hall
he looks through the screen door to the porch where candace kisses dereks cheek goodbye
as derek walks to his moms mercedes candace joins charlie
waving from car i hope you love the mix i made
the cover is hand painted
when he gets into his car she hands charlie the mix tape
charlie do you want this
are you sure
he gives me one every week
charlie sits on his bed reading to kill a mockingbird the cover taped back together
we see dereks mix
rotate in his old tape recorder
this next one might be a little sad but it reminded me of your eyes
the first notes of the smiths asleep begins
as morrissey sings charlie keeps reading
the reading is done
charlie proudly puts to kill a mockingbird on his newly dubbed shelf of fame
the songs continues as we see glimpses of charlies day to day life over the next few weeks
charlie exits his english class
freshmen bullies wait for him led by
did you already do the term paper on to
they grab and drag him into the boys room
we hear the toilet flush for the swirly
charlie looks at the new bottle of prescription wellbutrin
he puts a pill in his mouth and washes it down with rc cola
charlie watches his brother and the penn state nittany lions on tv
he looks over at his father but his dad is too busy building charlies clock for shop class to notice him
charlie carries his tray through the intimidating cafeteria
not giving up
looking for somewhere to sit
charlie sits by himself in the corner
he looks around the cafeteria wanting to break in
not knowing how
after a moment he returns to his book
the song ends
friday night football in western pa
charlie buys his coke and nachos and wanders to the bleachers
he sits alone trying to blend in by cheering with the rest of students
when the mill grove devils recover a fumble he hears
come on devils
charlie looks up at patrick cheering his head off
twin senior girls pass him taunting
suck it virginity pledges
charlie wants to go up to patrick so badly
after driving himself crazy sitting up and down twice he approaches
youre in my shop class right
hows your clock coming
my dads building it
mine looks like a boat
off charlies awkward silence you want to sit over here or are you waiting for your friends
ill sit if thats okay
patrick motions for charlie to sit
thanks for not calling me nothing by the way
its an endless nightmare
and these assholes actually think theyre being original
brad hays puts on his helmet and rushes onto the field
charlie dries his hands on his pants
a second silence that feels like a year
think of something to say
you like football
then maybe you know my broth hey sam
charlie looks up
standing there is the prettiest girl hes ever seen
sam would make every mother proud and every father nervous
she is alive adventurous and a world class flirt
could the bathrooms here be more disgusting
yes they call it the mens room
sam sits down sandwiching charlie between her and patrick
charlie tries to remain casual
hang in there buddy
well i finally got hold of bob
hes still trying to shag that waitress from the olive garden
hes never tossing that salad
brad hays marches the devils offense down the field
the kids clap
sam looks at charlie then turns back to patrick
about charlie patrick
your sister dates pony tail derek doesnt she
is that what they call him
leave pony tail derek alone
you put the ass in class patrick
i try sam
its nice to meet you charlie
sam extends her hand to charlie
every nail a different color
then sam grabs a nacho
so whats the plan sam
you want to go to mary elizabeths house
she got caught watering down her parents brandy with iced tea
lets just go to kings
turns to charlie hey
were going to kings after the game if you want to come
charlie nods just as brad hays tosses a touchdown pass
the fans go crazy
the devils faithful cheer as brad hays and his guys enter
the place is packed
patrick and sam drink coffee while charlie eats his brownie
theyre all excited
do you have a favorite band
i think the smiths are my favorite
are you kidding
i love the smiths
the best breakup band ever
whats your favorite song
its from louder than bombs
i heard it on pony tail dereks mix tape
that works on so many levels
i could make a copy for you
what about eides
you love eides right
never heard of it yeah
not a band charlie
its an old record store downtown
i used to be popular before sam got me some good music
so watch out charlie
shell ruin your life forever
brad hays the quarterback passes with his posse
let it go
its an old joke
she loves watching patrick get riled up
what are you going to do when you get out of here
my aunt helen said i should be a writer but i dont know what id write about
you could write about us
call it slut and the falcon
make us solve crimes
you guys look happy together
how long have you been boyfriend and girlfriend
off their laughs what
hes my step brother
my mom finally left my worthless dad and married his nice dad years ago
but sams not bitter
make no mistake
im not a bulimic
im a bulim ist
they laugh at their inside joke
charlie has no idea whats so funny
i dont know what that means
she just really believes in bulimia
cracking up i love bulimia
charlie hops out of sams old truck
the music blares
thanks for paying charlie
so eager no problem
thanks for the ride
maybe ill see you around in school
distracted to patrick god would you turn that down
youre going to make us deaf
charlie waves as the truck leaves
the look on his face
the happiness from one night of company
charlie enters the house excited to tell someone his news
he runs up the stairs to find the living room empty
he hears the tv playing downstairs in the basement
as charlie approaches he hears muffled sounds of fighting
i cant do anything about it
please talk to me
maybe your mom and i should have a drive us to our hair appointment contest
then i could spend a saturday with you
charlie looks through a slit in the open door to find
theres nothing i can do do you always want to be a mamas boy
i am not a mamas boy yes
every time i go to your house shhh
shut u your mom says dont go to columbia with candace
go to pitt derek
mommy needs you to stay at home because she cant drive herself
charlie enters wanting to stop the fight
dereks neck is red
candace keeps digging
and you just stand there like a little bitch dog
out of nowhere derek slaps her across the face
its not a movie slap
its a real slap
and after it silence
candace turns and sees charlie
it sobers her up
charlie moves at derek
candace stops him
charlie just go
i can handle it
just dont wake up mom and dad
she pushes him out of the room and closes the door
charlie sits at his desk
he hears a car start outside
he moves to his window and looks down at derek and candace near dereks mothers mercedes
derek is crying
after a beat
charlie stands frozen a look creeping across his face
hey look whos here
the door opens to reveal charlies mom and aunt helen entering the house
aunt helen carries a suitcase
the children dont know where shes been or why she looks sad
they just know they love her
little charlie stands at the top of the stairs with his brother and sister in their sunday clothes
there are balloons
welcome home aunt helen
look at you all dressed so nice
aunt helen smiles at little charlie on top of the stairs
charlie stands at the top of the stairs as candace enters the house
she is startled when she sees charlie
what are you doing
look i egged him on
you saw it
hes never hit me before
i promise hell never hit me again
shes about to go back downstairs when
like aunt helens boyfriends
a silence passes between them
this is pony tail derek
i can handle him
will you trust me
please dont tell mom and dad
with a desperately confident nod candace goes downstairs
charlie stands in the entry hall troubled
the homecoming dance is in full swing
god bless everyone
hes alone at the wall dressed in his sunday suit
to us adorable
to himself in living hell
charlie watches his sister slow dancing with derek
as happy as she looks charlie still isnt sure if he did the right thing by keeping quiet
the song ends to applause
after a beat charlie turns away
thats when he sees sam and patrick at the punch bowl
we hear the first notes of come on eileen by dexys midnight runners
oh my god
theyre playing good music
theyre playing good music
total mischief living room routine
living room routine
charlie watches sam and patrick run to the center of the floor and show this stiff crowd what dancing is
it starts slow
so over it hand moves
a little shoulder
and then the best of swing
seconds of genius
charlie takes a breath
then he tries desperately not to look like hes dancing toward them as he dances toward them
he bobs his head like a dork
and once he gets close patrick and sam turn and find him
without a pause they grab his hands and move together in a circle
their own island
after a moment sam moves around charlie like a maypole as the whole gym explodes into dance
the party rages inside this mansion in the rich part of town
patrick and sam walk up the steps with charlie tailing
god its freezing
but you wore that toasty costume
its not like youre trying too hard to be original
piss off tennessee tuxedo
are you sure its okay that i come
just remember charlie
bobs not paranoid
the door opens revealing bob
bob was the cool high school kid who never quite left
hes stoned so often that people cant tell the difference anymore
that waitress from the olive garden is a tease
will you marry me
only if i have patricks blessing
youre a hopeless stoner who attends the culinary institute
so im going to have to say no on that one but nice try
patrick leads charlie inside leaving bob staring at sam
this is a party
the music blasts
charlies eyes are our guide
as they walk through the crowd you can smell it
stale beer and cigarette smoke
high school parties
the room is packed with kids playing quarters
others pouring vodka into a watermelon
this is what fun looks like
patrick smiles when he spots two friends
you ready to meet some desperate women
mary elizabeth and alice both sit on the sofa together
mary elizabeth is smart a little overweight and extremely bossy
alice will figure out that shes a lesbian in college
right now she just likes movies and is mary elizabeths beta female
here have a seat
hey ladies meet charlie
charlie meet ladies
they shake hands and say their hellos
this is charlies first party ever
so i expect nice meaningful heartfelt blow jobs from both of you
patrick youre such a dick
where the hell did you go
the dance was a little boring dont you think
youre so selfish
we looked everywhere for you
you could have told someone
cry me a river
how is it that you got meaner since
just lucky i guess
i think youre doing something wrong
or something very right
patrick and mary elizabeth laugh at their banter just as sam calls out from the other side of the room
look whos here
the party turns and charlie sees brad hays the quarterback enter with sam and bob
patrick approaches them
charlie sits on the beat up couch next to the girls
is that brad hays
he comes here sometimes
but hes a popular kid
offended then what are we
charlie tries to think of something but he cant
the girls turn ignoring him
bob approaches with a tray
charlie you look like you could use a brownie
i was so hungry at the dance
i was going to go to kings but i didnt really have any time
mary elizabeth gives alice a knowing glance
charlie bites into the brownie
the icing gushing between his teeth
the image goes up into the smoke like an inhale as he chews and chews and chews
after a beat the music changes and the image exhales back down to charlie who is now
baked out of his mind
whole party surrounds him now pissing themselves with laughter as this shy kid talks and talks and talks
have you guys felt this carpet
this carpet feels so darn good
laughing charlie what do you think about high school
the cafeteria is called the nutrition center
and people wear their letter jackets even when its degrees out
and why do they give out letters for marching band
thats not a sport and we all know it
this kid is crazy
charlie looks at mary elizabeth with her new wave haircut
and mary elizabeth i think youre really going to regret that haircut when you look back at old photographs
off their laughter im really sorry
that sounded like a compliment in my head
oh my god
well its kind of true
sam enters the room
takes quick stock
bob did you get him stoned
come on sam
he likes it
just look at him
how do you feel charlie
i just really want a milkshake
the entire room explodes with laughter
charlie loves that people find him so funny
sam takes the ice cream from the freezer to the blender
charlie watches her make the perfect vanilla milkshake
sam you have such pretty brown eyes the kind of pretty that deserves to make a big deal about itself
you know what i mean
let me make the milkshake
what a great word
its like when you say your name over and over again in the mirror and after awhile it sounds crazy
im guessing youve never been high before
my best friend michael
his dad was a big drinker
so he hated all that stuff
well where is michael tonight
oh he shot himself last may
sam looks up
charlie is just stoned
i kind of wish hed left a note
you know what i mean
off her sad nod wheres the bathroom
its up the stairs
charlie wanders off
sam watches him go
charlie leaves the bathroom and stops when he sees himself in a large ornate mirror in the hallway
charlie wanders down the hallway a little lost
he finds the door to the master bedroom and opens it
he sees patrick and brad hays
nervous who is that kid
hes a friend of mine
patrick closes the bedroom door and follows charlie
i didnt see anything
i know you saw something but its okay
patrick takes a quick peek to make sure no one is watching
listen brad doesnt want anyone to know
wait are you baked
like a cake
thats what bob said
and how you cant have on a match because they would find us
and everyone laughed but i dont know whats funny
okay charlie listen
i need you to promise that youre not going to say anything to anyone about me and brad
this has to be our little secret
our little secret
well talk later
i look forward to that big talk
patrick laughs goes back to the room and closes the door
the party has thinned
sam watches charlie drink his milkshake obsessively with alice and mary elizabeth
isnt this the best milkshake alice
its even better than the first one
patrick walks downstairs
sam motions him over
barely audible whisper i need to talk to you
charlie just told me that his best friend shot himself
i dont think he has any friends
patrick turns to look at charlie
he feels so bad for the kid
patrick raises his plastic cup to the remaining crowd
raise your glasses to charlie
charlie looks up
a little paranoid
everyone is staring
what did i do
you didnt do anything
we just want to toast our new friend
off his look you see things
and you understand
youre a wallflower
charlie dries his sweaty hands on his pants
he looks around the room at the nods and friendly faces
what is it
well we didnt think there were any cool people left to meet
they all drink
sam approaches him
a knowing smile
welcome to the island of misfit toys
charlie smiles and the soundtrack comes rushing up loud
the truck speeds on highway toward the fort pitt tunnel
sam cranks the radio blaring the tunnel song
the stars anthem your ex lover is dead is our prototype for tone
what is this song
i have no idea
to charlie have you heard it before
light bulb wait
lets go through the tunnel
sam its freezing
patrick its the perfect song
mama patrick says no
patrick its sam
its sam talking to you im begging you to drive me
sam climbs through the window to the flat bed
she grips the flood lights to steady herself as she stands
what is she doing
she does it all the time
turn it up
you got it your highness
patrick turns up the volume and drums on the steering wheel just as the truck flies into
we go behind the truck
rising as sam puts her arms in the air
the image moves to charlies point of view rising from sams feet up her shivering legs
past the band aid on her right knee
to sams face as she looks down
into the camera
right at us
for we are now
charlie looking up at sam so in love with this free spirit
so happy to have friends
happy to be alive
charlie gets this look on his face
patrick notices and smiles
i feel infinite
the truck flies out of the fort pitt tunnel onto the bridge
patrick and charlie laugh as sam raises her arms
free and young and alive on the greatest night of charlies life
we see charlie proudly put a smiths poster on his wall next to photos of his new friends
he dances to his desk listening to air supplys all out of love on his walkman
dear friend im sorry i havent written for awhile but ive been trying hard not to be a loser
as the lyrics begin charlie unabashedly lip synchs
im lying alone with my head on the phone thinking of you til it hurts
charlie sits at his desk writing and lip synching
for example i am trying to participate by listening to sams collection of big rock ballads and thinking about love
sam says they are kitschy and brilliant
i completely agree
as the students file out charlie hands his paper to bill in exchange for a beat up copy of the great gatsby
i am also studying extra books outside of class
as it turns out mr
anderson is a writer
he even had a play put up in new york once which i think is very impressive
he and his wife might go back there after this year
i know this is selfish but i really hope he doesnt
charlie pauses in the doorway and turns back to look at bill
charlie turns from the lunch line with the great gatsby on his tray
he looks at the gang at their table
he sits with them as they debate the design of this months fanzine
my favorite time though is lunch because i get to see sam and patrick
we spend the time working on mary elizabeths fanzine about music and the rocky horror picture show
its called punk rocky
mary elizabeth is really interesting because she is a buddhist and a punk but somehow she always acts like my father at the end of a long day
the xerox spits out copies of punk rocky
alice staples while mary elizabeth works her like a sled dog
her best friend alice loves vampires and wants to go to film school
she also steals jeans from the mall
i dont know why because her family is rich but im trying not to be judgemental
especially since i know how they were all there for patrick last year
patrick never likes to be serious so it took me awhile to get what happened
sam and alice laugh when patrick begins stapling mary elizabeths fanzines to within an inch of their life
note the following sequence will come from charlies pov of patrick and brads activities over a weekend
brad hays leads the football team through the banner onto the field as charlie patrick and sam cheer
moments later brad pulls his helmet on and rushes onto the field
when he was a junior patrick started seeing brad on the weekends in secret
i guess it was hard too because brad had to get drunk every time they fooled around
patrick whispers while the gang studies their sat books
then monday in school brad would say man i was so wasted
i dont remember a thing
this went on for months
charlie sits with his family in itchy church clothes
he turns to see brad with his father and mother
brads dad gives him a pat on the back
when they finally did it brad said he loved patrick
then he started to cry
saying his dad would kill him
and saying he was going to hell
we see patrick and brad walking in the library
they reach the stacks and just when it looks like theyll speak they simply
pass each other without a word
patrick was eventually able to help brad get sober
i asked patrick if he felt sad that he had to keep it a secret and he said no because at least now brad doesnt have to get drunk to
brad sits down with his football pals
patrick joins charlie and sam at their table
charlie looks over at sam studying hard for her sats
i think that i understand because i really like sam
i asked my sister about her and she said that when sam was a freshman the upper classmen used to get her drunk at parties
i guess she had a reputation
but i dont care
id hate for her to judge me based on what i used to be like
we see charlie making a mix tape on his boom box
so ive been making her a mix tape so she will know how i feel
the two cassettes run
the song is just about to finish when
the side runs out of tape and snaps off
the marquee announces its time for the
rocky horror picture show
the rocky emcee dressed as riff raff whips the crowd into a frenzy
gimme an r
gimme an o
r o c k y
gimme a c
gimme a k
whats that spell
the crowd cheers
charlie claps from the front row
the movie is in full swing
charlie watches sam as janet in the floor show
sam mimics susan sarandon perfectly
especially the body
she winks at charlie as fanfare dont dream it begins and arriving regally as frank n furter in full drag is
whatever happened to fae wray
that delicate satin draped frame
as it clung to her thigh how i started to cry cause i wanted to be dressed just the same
patrick is a rock star
he approaches charlie
putting his ass in his face
charlie is freaked out and laughing
especially when he sees brad alone in the back smiling
give yourself over to absolute pleasure
swim the warm waters of sins of the flesh
erotic nightmares beyond any measure
and sensual daydreams to treasure forever
cant you just see it
woah oh oh
charlie stops laughing when the orgy begins between patrick mary elizabeth as columbia craig an art student with a models body as rocky
and of course
charlie watches sam until he cant take his lust or guilt
we hear the chorus of dont dream it be it as charlie watches all of the exciting cast members at the after show party
charlie sees a photo of sams naked back on the wall of craigs loft
very black white
charlies lust and guilt are now at
alice looks at the photo
its gorgeous craig
what did you use
craig is impressive to high school kids
hes a little pretentious
but his art school life
his red wine
right now he holds court in the wine line
color film but black and white paper for the printing
my professor gave me an a but for the wrong reasons
most of them are idiots
youll see what i mean when you get to college
how were your sats by the way
i think ill get into nyu
yeah i hope so
cruel to alice
charlie sees sam alone on the loft steps
she looks a little down
he hands sam a plastic cup and sits next to her
are you okay
but i got my sat results back
you can take them again
yeah its just if im going to penn state main campus i have to do much better
i wish i would have studied freshman year
i was a bit of a mess
ill help you study for the next one
yeah of course
charlie summons his courage
he hands her the mix tape
just a mix tape
no big deal
my parents have a pretty good stereo
its all about that night in the tunnel
i couldnt find that song we were listening to but im still searching for it so its okay
these are great
you have really good taste charlie
way better than me as a freshman
i used to listen to the worst top
yeah i did
but then i heard this old song
pearly dew drops drop
and i thought someday i would be at a party in college or something
and id look up and see this person across the room
and from that moment id know everything was going to be okay
you know what i mean
devastated in love yeah
the tape revolves in the stereo playing a beautiful ballad
charlie watches sam sway to his music like a serenade
like she is dancing with him
but she isnt
a wider angle reveals that she is slow dancing with
charlie is year old crushed
patrick alice and mary elizabeth watch sam across the room
so what do you think
i dont know
i hope it works out
craig would be a big step up from her last boyfriend
who could forget mr
car wash loser
i just hope she stops playing dumb with these guys
i keep telling her
dont make yourself small
you cant save anybody
craig dips a smiling sam as the song ends
sam goes into the kitchen
craig approaches charlie
turns off his mix tape
man your mix is morbidly sad kid
how about something a little more upbeat
craig grabs a record from the pile and slaps it down
sam tells me you want to be a writer
dont you write poetry craig
poetry writes me
craigs upbeat song begins to play
he dances over to sam
charlies heart breaks as he watches sam hug on craig
in a mirror image candace hugs on derek near the lockers
charlie closes his own locker and moves down the hall
the bell rings
charlie sets down his on the road paper
that was fast
you want another one
bill smiles and reaches into his desk
he hands charlie a copy of a separate piece
charlie takes the book and starts to walk out but he turns back
can i ask you something
why do nice people choose the wrong people to date
are we talking about anyone specific
bill looks straight at him
coming from a history of personal experience and pain
we accept the love we think we deserve
can we make them know they deserve more
we can try
charlie waits nervously at a booth
he sees sam enter
he fixes his hair then pretends to read his sat prep book
i didnt see you come in
you want to work on probabilities and statistics
they open their books and a christmas song begins
in a quick passage of time we see them study next to halloween decorations
and finally christmas decorations
the song continues
charlies mom and sister hang the christmas ornaments as charlie helps his dad find that one
can i have dollars
old joke dollars
what do you want dollars for
sam is doing secret santa
its her favorite thing in the world
charlies father reaches into his pocket and hands charlie a bill
its a fifty
dad winks in a great mood
lockers are opened by charlie
wrapped gifts are deposited
everyone loves getting their presents except charlie who got socks
bill hands charlie a well worn copy of the catcher in the rye
this was my favorite book growing up
this is my copy but i want you to have it
have a great christmas break
you too mr
callahan the shop teacher looks at a sad sack girls clock
he takes a moment and then
he moves to charlies dads amazing clock
he hands charlie an a on a piece of paper
thats pretty good charlie
callahan moves to patricks shitty wooden clock
the ugliest clock youve ever seen in your life
youve got to be kidding me
if you fail me you get me next semester
callahan writes a grade and slaps it down
the song continues as patrick holds up the grade
charlie and sam cheer as patrick screams at the top of his lungs
ladies and gentlemen i am below average
patrick screams at the city in the distance
we move to find sam holding her sat score up to the group
sam hugs charlie
charlie carries sam on his shoulders past the christmas tree
sam wears a santa hat like a hot elf
no more applications
no more sats
thank you charlie
they pass mary elizabeth as she opens her final present
multiple pairs of blue jeans
this is a really tough one but im going to have to guess
bob nudges her
guilty as charged
mary elizabeth pulls one last item out of the gift bag
she actually paid
im so touched
patrick pours everyone brandy
the kids look ridiculous but they dont feel ridiculous
he went home to connecticut
hell be back for new years eve
im sorry we wont be seeing him tonight
sam nods then turns
charlie is delighted
the kids settle in the living room in front of the fire
alright big brother by weeks
whos your secret santa
ill tell you sam
this ones tough
i have received a harmonica a magnetic poetry set a book about harvey milk and a mix with the song asleep on it
charlie starts snickering
he cant help himself
i mean i have no idea
this collection of presents is so gay that i think i must have given them to myself
but despite that distinct possibility im going to have to go with
charlie holds up his hands
they all cheer
its your turn
charlie and patrick switch places
uh i have received socks pants a shirt and a belt
i was ordered to wear them all tonight
so im guessing my secret santa is mary elizabeth
now why do you say that
i dont know
she bosses people around sometimes
the gang cracks up
mary elizabeth is pissed
what the hell is wrong with you
well youll be surprised to know that your secret santa is actually
you got me clothes
because all the great writers used to wear great suits
your last present is on a towel rack in the bathroom
delve into our facilities
emerge a star
charlie gives sam a sack of presents
can you hand these out while im gone
wait a second
theres only secret santa presents
there are rules charlie
mary elizabeth why are you trying to eat christmas
hand them out sam
sam gives out the presents
the group rips them open
alice looks at a book about martin scorsese with the inscription
alice i know youll get into nyu
alice turns to mary elizabeth who holds up a card with
reads card to print punk rocky in color next time
bob blows soap bubbles into the air
he knows me
he really knows me
sam looks at her present
an old record of the beatles classic something with a card
she reads the card
holds it to her chest
come on out charlie
they all chime in
lets go young man
charlie opens the door off camera and we see his entrance play off their faces
the reverse angle reveals
charlie dressed in his suit
like the best of english mods in the s
for those of you who know the book this is the cover
they all clap
what a display of man i have ever seen
sam and charlie look at each and smile
the door opens
sam and charlie walk into the dark room
where are we going
its a surprise
sam flips the switch bathing the room in light
sams room is so cool
a shrine to music
a xerox that says the beatings will continue until morale improves
virgin mary icons
is this your room
its so cool
sam points to a green box with a red ribbon on her desk
you got me a present
with all that help on my penn state application
of course i did
charlie lifts up the box to reveal an old manual typewriter
i dont know what to say
you dont have to say anything
sam goes over and types
write about us sometime
he smiles and types back
they look at each other
we can hear a lovely ballad playing downstairs
im sorry we cant be here for your birthday
im just sorry you have to go back and visit your dad
im in such a great mood i dont think even he could ruin it
i feel like im finally doing good
what about you
when i met you you were this scared freshman
and look at you in that suit
youre like a sexy english school boy
i saw mary elizabeth checking you out
innocent laugh no
worst kind of guys
never see you coming
and parents love you
well it hasnt worked so far
youve never had a girlfriend
not even a nd grade valentine
he shakes his head
have you ever kissed a girl
what about you
have i ever kissed a girl
your first kiss
sam gets this strange look in her eyes
a little haunted
my first kiss
his name was robert
he would come over to the house all the time
was he your first boyfriend
he was my dads boss
charlie goes silent
you know charlie i used to sleep with guys who treated me like shit
and get wasted all the time
i feel like i have a chance
i could even get into a real college
you can do it
she had that same thing done to her too
and she turned her life around
she must have been great
she was my favorite person in the world
shes very moved
charlie i know that you know i like craig
but i want to forget that for a minute
i just want to make sure that the first person who kisses you loves you
and with that sam leans over and kisses him
it starts softly then sam wraps her thin arms around him
holding on for lonely life
when the song crescendos and they part charlie and sam look at each other
i love you charlie
i love you too
the porch lights are as golden as charlie feels right now
we see the girls wave to each other and hug sam
good luck at your dads
see you at new years
patrick approaches charlie in the doorway
have a good time at your moms
since you were born on christmas eve i figure you dont get a lot of birthday presents
so i thought you should have my clock
from the heart
thank you patrick
sam gives charlie one last hug
patrick and sam watch their friends leave
i love you guys
we fly as high as charlie feels
above the city on christmas eve
the front door opens revealing charlies dad
look whos here
he moves out of the way and standing there is charlies older brother chris kelmeckis
chris is handsome charismatic and an all around winner
come here little sister
chris smiles big and son flirts with his mom
ma you look so thin
when he lets go he sees charlie and smiles
chris and charlie look at each other in silence
as the family moves into the dining room to celebrate chris gives him a quiet
make a wish honey
we move closer to charlie as he makes his wish and blows out his candles
the wind blows out a candle in one of the luminaria bags
the suburb is quiet
not a creature is stirring
he fills a brown paper bag with sand and a candle
he lights the candle making the bag glow like a beautiful lantern
he looks down his street where families are out with their kids doing the same luminaria ritual
the same street
many years ago
aunt helen and the kids finish their luminaria bags
aunt helen lights up the candles
can you see it charlie
the luminaria is a landing strip for santa claus
the image goes wide
all of these bags glowing
aunt helen rattles her keys
keep an eye out for him with your brother and sister
ill be right back
she bends down and whispers into his ear
im going to get your birthday present
she musses his hair and gets in the car
charlie hovers over the glowing luminaria
something is bothering him
he shakes it off
charlie wanders through the quiet house
he turns the corner where he finds chris sitting at the table
hes lit by a couple of candles and the blinking lights of the christmas tree
hes surrounded by leftovers
chris chews and swallows
they both whisper
god i missed moms cooking
you have no idea how good you have it
im actually beginning to hate pizza
grabs a hershey kiss cookie
how are you liking school
im no brainiac like you or candace
but im doing okay
youre playing in a bowl game
a moment passes
chris changes his tone
how are you feeling charlie
you know what i mean
is it bad tonight
im not picturing things anymore
and when i do i can just shut it off
and maybe if it does get bad again you can just talk to them yeah
im going to ask her out at new years
i think the time is right now
chris smiles at his kid brother
we hear the church organ
the family moves down the line to receive holy communion at christmas mass
charlies father then mother then sister take the sacrament
charlie is next
the priest makes the motion of the cross with the communion wafer
he places it in charlies hand
charlie brings the sacrament to his mouth with his fingers
we move in closer to charlies fingers in his mouth
when he takes his hand out we see
a tab of lsd
the church organ is now a rock organ
and its now
new years eve
charlie closes his mouth
he looks down the hall of the smoky room where craig has his arm around sam
charlie turns to mary elizabeth whos also dosed
how long does this take to work
the sound is muted thick
charlie shovels the snow
fascinated by his breath making fog
sam comes outside
shes worried about him
shoveling snow huh
i have to get this driveway clean
then i have to congratulate you for being happy because you deserve it
you said that an hour ago
was that tonight
i was looking at this tree but it was a dragon and then
dont freak out
just give me the shovel
charlie looks up
sees the stars
isnt it quiet
sam you ever think that if people knew how crazy you really were no one would ever talk to you
all the time
so you want to put on these glasses
theyll protect you
sam puts her arm around his shoulder
charlie looks through the glasses
the sky bends like a globe
when he breathes the sky ripples
charlie wanders through the party tripping out of his mind
he sits down on the sofa
the world unbends as charlie takes off the glasses
kids walk around the party leaving ghosts of themselves behind
charlie looks upstairs to find
sam and craig kissing
craig leads her to the bedroom
charlie looks back at the party as kids gather for the new years countdown
patrick leads the charge
in a quick flash we see year old charlie with aunt helen on christmas eve
she bends to whisper in his ear
itll be our little secret all right
we are back to present as charlie takes a deep breath and tries to remember that hes at a new years party
happy new year
the crowd cheers leaving ghosts of themselves
charlie gets up from the sofa and walks out of bobs house
charlie walks down the road under a streetlight
the road is icy
charlie lays down and starts moving his arms in the snow
the memories begin to haunt him
year old charlie waves goodbye to aunt helen as she drives away through the landing strip for santa claus
year old charlie blinks
the memories come faster
aunt helen drives past a tall snow drift
she looks down at the of the beatles in the seat next to her
she smiles at charlies birthday present
then she looks up as the headlights of the semi truck smash the windows with a crash
charlies mother opens the door revealing a policeman
he turns to charlie in his party hat
years old and confused
year old charlie lays on the snow shivering as the image goes high above to reveal hes made a snow angel
the emergency room is bustling on new years day
charlie looks up as the police doctors and his parents tower over him
he is terrified and does what any kid would do
he lies his ass off
did your older friends pressure you
no one pressured me into anything
i would never do drugs officer
then how did you happen to be passed out on the ground at in the morning
i was really tired and uh
i was feeling feverish
so i went outside for a walk just to get some cold air
and i started seeing things
so i passed out
he waits to see if this worked
and then unexpectedly
worried youre seeing things again charlie
oops not uh
the tires squish the grey slush puddle as the busses pull into the dreary parking lot
school is back in session
charlie shakes off the cold then takes off his overcoat to reveal
hes wearing his suit from secret santa
all the kids stare
charlie realizes he made a terrible mistake
it was a christmas present
charlie sits as bill hands out the book for the semester
the great gatsby
as the kids chatter bill gives charlie his own book to start the year
did you have fun on your break
more fun than youre going to have today sinatra
bill pats his shoulder and moves on
the smart ass freshman looks at charlie and whispers
nice look jag off
the rocky horror faithful enter the theater
i called him times
mary elizabeth and the kids get ready for the floor show
well what are we supposed to do
were going on in minutes
the phone rings
mary elizabeth picks up
charlie turns to brad sitting next to him
charlie is freaking out
but they said in health class they say that about lsd to scare you
are you sure
charlie youre fine man
mary elizabeth hangs up the phone frustrated
guys we have an emergency
craig flaked out on us again
i need a rocky
scared no way
there are people out here
the group is deflated
they all start thinking
after a beat mary elizabeth looks at charlie
take off your clothes
you know those dreams you have when you are standing in front of people in your underwear
well this is no dream
we hear a heart beat as charlie dances out of the rocky gauze and finds himself standing in tight gold underwear looking out at people cheering him on
his friends cant stop smiling
especially mary elizabeth who watches charlies little butt in the gold undies
touch a touch a touch me is in full swing
sam slinks over to charlie dressed in her white bra and slip
as janet so if anything grows while you pose
ill oil you up and drop you down
and thats just one small fraction of the main attraction
you need a friendly hand
and i need action
sam grabs charlies hands and rubs them all over her chest
touch a touch a touch me
i wanna be dirty
creature of the night
the song continues
we see flashes of the nights performance as charlie goes from train wreck to triumph
charlie joins sam in the kick line and it feels like its just the two of them
on the final beat sam gasps
creature of the night
the song ends
the cast bows
sam and patrick push charlie in front for his own curtain call
its the night hell never forget
the wind whips
that bracing february cold
charlie helps mary elizabeth carry the costumes outside to her car
maybe i could join the cast as an alternate or something
were filled up now but theyll need people after we leave for college
i could put in a good word for you
thatd be great
they put the box in her trunk
snap it closed
we cant help but notice the keep your laws off my body bumper sticker as mary elizabeth tries her best to flirt
have you heard of the sadie hawkins dance
the one where the girl asks the guy
well obviously its completely stupid and sexist
its like hey thanks for the crumb
and normally id just blow it off because school dances suck torture
but you know its my last year and
would you maybe want to go with me
you want to go with me
im sick of macho guys
and you looked really cute in your costume
so what do you say
charlie thinks and thinks and
charlies mom opens the door for mary elizabeth
charlie straightens out his church suit
you must be mary elizabeth
its so good to meet you
you too mrs
shit eating grin charlie tells me youre a buddhist
charlie and mary elizabeth stand next to candace and derek
ok a little closer together
that looks nice
buddhist i need you to smile a little bit more
there you go
the picture of kids
charlie and mary elizabeth slow dance to an s love song
hands on hips
charlie looks around the gym
he sees alice dancing with her date an effeminate goth kid
well never meet him but hell make us laugh once
charlie then watches patrick dance with sam
he follows patricks gaze across the floor to brad who dances with a senior girl
charlie sees the boys look at each other
for one moment its like theyre dancing together
mary elizabeth is at the punch bowl with the gang
charlie sees sam standing by the wall looking sad
are you having a good time
how about you
i dont know
this is my first date so i dont know what to compare it to
youre doing fine
charlie joins her at the wall
mary elizabeth gives them a quick jealous look
im sorry craig didnt come
he said he didnt want to go to some stupid high school dance
cant say i blame him
i dont know
if you like it he should come
have a beautiful first date
you deserve it
ill try not to make you too jealous
he said it to cheer her up
sam forces a smile and leaves
mary elizabeth approaches charlie on the antique sofa
she uncorks a bottle of wine
she hands him the bottle
now let it breathe
mary elizabeth walks over to the vintage turntable
she turns on the gas fireplace with a remote control
this is sure a nice house
mary elizabeth drops the needle on a vinyl lp
a doo wop make out classic begins to play
she dances over to charlie
dont you just love old music
off his nod good
because i made you a mix of it
id love to expose you to great things
like billie holiday and foreign films
she pours the wine
charlie looks at the bottle
this merlot is really fancy
my dad collects wine but he doesnt drink
thats weird isnt it
where are your parents
their club is hosting a cotillion or something racist
theyll be gone all night
mary elizabeth drops her necklace with a thud
charlie looks around
thats sure a nice fire
after im done being a lobbyist i want to move to a house like this in cape cod
that sounds nice doesnt it
she reaches out and touches his chest
your heart is beating really fast
she puts her hand on his
moves it to his chest
do you like me
you know what i mean
i think so
dont be nervous
she slowly moves his hand to her dress strap
it falls off her shoulder
she leans in for a red wine kiss
she guides his hand over her bra
he feels her breast
for a quick moment charlie imagines he is kissing sam
mary elizabeth moves his hand away
charlie blinks taking a moment to realize sams not the one in the room
the song is over
the needle turns at the end of the record
she gives him one last kiss
content she lays down on his lap
i didnt know how it was going to go tonight but it was really nice huh
i cant believe it
you of all people
i just cant believe youre my boyfriend
we land on charlies face
and then we hear the oh shit
the mad scramble for clothes begins
mary elizabeths car pulls in front of charlies house
charlie gets out
wanting to say hes not her boyfriend
not knowing how
mary elizabeth smiles
see you monday
with that she backs out of the driveway
we see him from the back of her car getting smaller and smaller
his stomach already filling with acid
im sorry i havent written for awhile but things are a total disaster
sam patrick and alice are seated around the table
mary elizabeth has her arms around charlie
were literally making out and im in my bra
and the front door opens
its my parents
im scrambling to get my dress on
it was crazy
charlie nods tortured
i probably should have been honest about how i didnt want to go out with mary elizabeth after sadies but i really didnt want to hurt her feelings
charlie gets out of the school bus to immediately find mary elizabeth waiting for him
she sees the cross of ashes on his forehead
she thinks his ashes are a smudge
she cleans it
you see mary elizabeth is a really nice person underneath the part of her that hates everyone
and since i heard that having a girlfriend makes you happy i tried hard to love her like i love sam
can you believe its almost our two week anniversary
a double date
craig and sam buy the tickets to see the silent classic the cabinet of dr
so i took her on double dates
proud your first foreign film
vegans dont eat butter
charlie tries not to feel mary elizabeths sweaty hand
and i tried not to mind that she loves to hold hands even when her hands are sweaty
just like sadies except
the fire in the fireplace is out
we move from the fireplace to charlie touching mary elizabeths breasts over her sweater
and i had to admit something really upsetting
but i am tired of touching her boobs
i thought maybe if she would just let me pick the make out music once in awhile we might have a chance
charlie looks at the ani difranco mix on the stereo
the gang is there
walden rests on charlies lunch tray
and maybe if she didnt put down the books that mr
anderson gives me
i read it in th grade
i would have called it on boring pond
charlie grabs the cordless
he looks at patricks clock
his voice can no longer hide his quiet rage
or if she would stop calling me the minute i get home from school when i have absolutely nothing to talk about other than the bus ride home
that dairy just sits with you
it walks with you
charlie calmly puts down the phone and leaves the room
charlie is so miserable
his mom is sympathetic
shes on the phone right now
charlie you have to break up with her
i can do that
charlies father leans back from the sofa and his newspaper
for christs sake
i need to use the phone
mary elizabeth is still talking on the cordless
ill give you this book
its really how i became a vegan i know i should have been honest but i was getting so mad it was starting to scare me
he looks back at the clock
can i talk to you charlie
please dont interrupt
you know i hate that
charlie goes to his quiet place
i just wish i could have found another way to break up
in hindsight i probably could not have picked a worse way to be honest with mary elizabeth
truth or dare
the gang is seated in a circle drinking from plastic cups
charlie sits between mary elizabeth and sam
who are you talking to
i dare you to kiss alice
licks his lips get ready breeder
as patrick approaches an apprehensive alice
samantha told me that you got into harvard
re charlie this one still hasnt gotten me flowers
to charlie but i forgive you
she kisses him
charlie bites his cheeks
sam looks a little depressed
to sam dont worry about penn state
youre just wait listed
excuse me everyone but youre missing some hot fag on goth action
patrick is getting ready to plant the biggest kiss on alice when she jumps him
patrick looks for the next person
charlies heart pounds
dont pick me
truth or dare
how is your first relationship going
its so bad that i keep fantasizing that one of us is dying of cancer so i dont have to break up with her
truth or dare
it was all fantasy
i dare you to kiss the prettiest girl in the room on the lips
notice i charitably said girl and not person because lets face it
id smoke all you bitches
alice hits him
he looks at mary elizabeth then turns to sam
before sam can even react
charlie plants a kiss right on her lips
when he opens his eyes he looks around and realizes the magnitude of his mistake
after a horrible silence
now thats fucked up
without a word mary elizabeth just stands dignified and goes into the kitchen
mary elizabeth im sorry
im alice follows mary elizabeth
sam is close behind
i didnt mean anything by it
sam turns and looks at him
she doesnt even recognize him
what the hell is wrong with you
charlie is devastated
they move to the driveway
charlie feels awful
you dont want to go back there
i didnt mean to do anything
i know you didnt but look
i hate to be the one to break this but theres history with mary elizabeth and sam
things that have nothing to do with you
its best if you stay away for awhile
how long do you think
charlie looks over at patrick who wears a grave expression
its going to be a long time
we hear the sound of the typewriter
charlie sits at his desk
it looks like hes barely slept
he begins typing
the keys up close and loud
close up typing dear friend i have not seen my friends for weeks now
i am starting to get bad again
charlie stares at the typewriter
little charlie pops his head around the corner from the hallway
he looks at something we cant see yet
charlies mom opens the door
were going to be late for easter mass
ill be there in a minute
charlie forces a smile then looks back at the typewriter
and tries to shake off the memory
little charlie looks at aunt helen as she smokes her cigarette and sobs
charlie is lost
his family sits in the pews for easter mass
charlie watches the priest recite the lords prayer
our father who art in heaven
hallowed be thy name
thy kingdom come year old charlie watches the priest recite the lords prayer
he looks at aunt helens picture on the coffin
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
give us this day our daily bread
year old charlie looks haunted by the memory
and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us the voices drift away and all charlie can see is
year old charlie takes aunt helens hand to make her stop crying
year old charlie blinks as the voices come back
and lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from charlie on the phone
his voice wavers a bit
ive been listening to the billie holiday cd every night and its too late charlie
i just feel really bad about what i did
i just get so messed up inside like im not there or something
tell it to someone who cares
weve all become such good friends good friends
you mean the people ive known since kindergarten that youve known for months
those good friends
i mean i dont want to do anything to ruin our its ruined
so stop calling everyone
stop embarrassing yourself
goodbye mar dial tone
charlie hangs up the phone
charlie is terribly anxious
he watches bob groom some pot
somethings wrong with me dont worry about it
you hear from patrick
he told me to stay away
you dont know
brads father caught them together
as kids open lockers and move to morning period charlie stares at brad
he has a black eye and cuts on his face
he look like he was beaten up badly
students whisper gossip
some lebo kids jumped him outside the o
it was some kids from north hills
thats not what i heard
brad moves into the arms of charlotte cheerleader cute
as brad kisses her charlie sees patrick down the hall watching them
patrick closes his locker
are you okay
not now charlie
patrick storms off
charlie sits at his table alone
he watches patrick leave the lunch line passing a chorus of
patrick says nothing
hes too sad to fight the mob today
he just moves to his table when the nose tackle sticks out his leg
patrick falls on his tray
the kids laugh
patrick smiles to himself dusts off and turns to brad
you going to do something
what are you talking about
your pet ape just tripped me
are you going to say something
why would i
you know why
its too far
brad can feel people staring
this is pathetic man
your fixation on me
brads friends laugh
patricks eyes narrow
do you want your friends to know how you got those bruises
i got jumped in a parking lot
in schenley park
do they know about schenley park
to brads friends do you guys know about schenley park
brad stands and gets right in patricks face
i dont know what kind of sick shit youre trying to pull
real warning but you better walk away now
say hi to your dad for me
patrick turns and leaves
and then as an afterthought
brads friends laugh
patrick stops and turns
what did you call me
i called you a faggo smack
before brad can even finish patrick throws a vicious right to the cheek
brad tackles him
and the two start fighting
the cafeteria erupts in noise
say that shit again
say that shit again
brads football buddies rise and peel patrick off brad
mary elizabeth and sam jump up from their corner table
the cafeteria gets louder
the nose tackle holds patrick up
the linebacker hits patrick in the face
sam rushes up and the nose tackle pushes her down
she lands on her tail bone
patrick gets hit a couple of times in the face
the kids cheer the fight
its getting louder and louder with more and more noise
charlie comes out from a blink
he calmly looks around
for a moment he doesnt understand where he is
he looks up
all the kids are staring at him
they are all quiet
afraid of him
charlie looks at his hand clenched in a fist
it is already covered with
charlies confused until he sees the linebacker holding his broken bloody nose
hes looking at charlie
the image pans over
the nose tackle is on the ground
charlie stands over them
he is disconnected
its an out of body experience
he reaches out and helps patrick to his feet
then he calmly turns and stares right through brad
icy calm if you touch my friends again ill blind you
brad is stunned
so is everyone
charlie sits in the waiting room of the principals office
he looks through the glass where principal small talks to brad
after a beat she pats brads shoulder and opens the door
leaving charlie and brad alone in the waiting room
just as brad is about to leave
thanks for stopping them
brad doesnt look at him
he just moves on
charlie exits the building
kids stare at him
then look away
charlie feels very lost until he sees
it brings him back instantly
and then gently
how you doing charlie
i dont know
i keep trying but
i cant really remember what i did
sam can see hes afraid of himself
she nods sympathetic
do you want me to tell you
you saved my brother
thats what you did
so youre not scared of me
and can we be friends again
the minute she hugs him the numb goes away
she kisses the top of his head and puts her arm around his shoulder
they begin walking away
lets go be psychos together
mary elizabeth looks at us because she wants us to know
im dating peter now
she motions to peter
good looking ish
hes in college with craig
hes opinionated and we have intellectual debates
you were very sweet but our relationship was too one sided
i know this is hard for you
im just glad youre happy
mary elizabeth joins peter
charlie looks at his friends
that says they forget
after a beat patrick comes downstairs
he looks sad with his bruises
hey craig sam will be down soon
were going to miss the movie
yeah ill go put some pep in her step
as craig moves upstairs patrick approaches charlie
you wanna get out of here
patrick drives sams truck up the hill to the overlook
ill tell you something charlie
i feel good
you know what i mean
maybe tomorrow ill take you to this karaoke place downtown
and this club off the strip
they dont card
and the schenley park scene
you gotta see the fruit loop at least one time
charlie and patrick walk the lighted path howling at the moon
patrick holds a thermos filled with who knows what
oh my god
my life is officially an after school special
son of a bitch
laughing it kind of is
it so is
they arrive at the lookout
so you ever hear the one about lily miller
i dont know
i thought your brother would have told you
its a classic
so lily comes here with this guy parker
and this was going to be the night they were going to lose their virginity
so she did it really proper
she packed a picnic
stole a bottle of wine
everything was perfect and theyre just about to do it when they realize they forgot the condoms
so what do you think happened
i dont know
they did it with one of the sandwich bags
they start laughing and screaming
lets keep the train rolling
patrick points to charlie who thinks
there was this girl named second base stace
she had boobs in the th grade mosquito bites
and she let some of the boys feel them
thats your suburban legend
did you at least cop a feel
of course not
you went home listened to asleep wrote a poem about her self esteem fine
patrick walks over and sits down next to charlie
yeah ive got one
well there was this one guy
queer as a dollar bill
guys father didnt know about his son
so he comes down into the basement one night when hes supposed to be out of town
catches his son with another boy
so he starts beating him
but not like the slap kind
like the real kind
and the boyfriend says stop
youre killing him
and the son just yells get out
and eventually the boyfriend just did
gripped by sad
he cant shake
why cant you save anybody
i dont know
im free now right
i could meet the love of my life any second now
things will be different now and thats good
i just need to meet a good guy
patrick looks at him
charlie has never seen him so vulnerable
after a beat
patrick kisses charlie on the mouth
unsure of what to do charlie lets it happen
his eyes open the whole time
a moment then patrick looks at charlie
he collapses into his chest
charlie holds his friend as patrick begins to cry
and we leave them the city lights small in the distance
we see the truck glide down the highway
ive been spending a lot of time with patrick
he begins every night really excited
patrick and charlie are parked at the entrance of schenley park
patrick speaks very animated until
he always says he feels free and tonight is his destiny
but after awhile he runs out of things to keep himself numb
the words leave him and we can see how sad he really is
patrick hands sam an envelope
sam holds it
pins and needles
then sam got her letter from penn state
sam opens the letter
tears instantly well up in her eyes
she leaves the room and walks down the hall
patrick picks up the letter
reading we will require you to take our summer session at the main campus immediately following your high school graduation
off charlies look she got in charlie
charlie turns back to sam
she holds him with sweet relief and redemption
charlie laughs with his friends in the cafeteria
after that all patrick could talk about
did get into nyu film school
patrick is going to the university of washington because he wants to be near the music in seattle
charlie and a group of students stand looking up at the wall which is covered with
but he wasnt going to leave without organizing the best senior prank ever
all the shop tools painted pink the shop teacher mr
callahan stares at the wall furious
as the students gawk charlie smiles to himself
sam and the girls chat excitedly
summer is almost here
sam is going to leave right after graduation
it all feels very exciting i just wish it were happening to me
charlie sits on his bed finishing the letter
especially because ever since i blacked out in the cafeteria its been getting worse
and i cant turn it off this time
charlie puts down the letter
the kids pass their copies of the great gatsby up to the front where bill collects them for next years freshmen
the class is buzzing loud
guys you want to pass your copies of gatsby up to the front please
and i know its the last day but if we could just keep it to a dull roar id appreciate it
the class quiets down
thank you for such a great year
i had a blast
i hope you did too
and i hope you have a great time this summer on your vacations
now who here is going to be reading for pleasure this summer
charlie looks to see if anyone is watching
then decides to raise his hand anyway
bill is proud
very good charlie
charlie looks at the smart ass freshman who tormented him all year
nothing left to say to him
the last kids exit the classroom
charlie walks down the aisle and stands in front of bill
so uh i know its none of my business but have you decided
are you going to new york
well my wife and i like it here and i think i might be better at teaching than writing
charlie is relieved
bill is staying
so uh charlie
i was thinking maybe i could still give you books next year
i think you could write one of them one day
fragile belief really
charlie is quiet
youre the best teacher i ever had
he gives bill a shy sideways hug
the two men say nothing else
charlie waves and leaves
bill smiles to himself
times square has nothing on these seniors
charlie watches the gang on their last day of high school
when the clock hits seconds to pm all the students chant
oh my god get me the hell out of here
they all cheer and hug each other
patrick loses his mind with joy and charges down the hallway
a brilliant sunset
we see the gang
running up the bleachers after the sun
i wanted to tell you about us running
there was this beautiful sunset
and just a few hours before everyone i love had their last day of high school ever
and i was happy because they were happy even though i counted and i have days to go
charlie sees candace posing for dads camera
for a moment we think candace went to prom with derek
i kept thinking about what school was going to be like without them as they
as mom and dad move out of the way we realize candace is standing with her best girlfriends
they look beautiful
my sister finally decided to break up with derek and go stag with her girlfriends instead
prom night continues
the antique limo is so garish its great
charlie snaps pictures with sams mom and patricks dad
mary elizabeth is with her boyfriend peter
alice stands with patrick dashing in his mod suit tux
and then there was sam
the image moves to the front of the house where sam emerges
she wears a vintage flapper dress from the s
ive looked at her pictures since that night
i like to see how happy she was before she knew
sam joins craig
they kiss for the cameras then run with the rest of the gang to the limosine
they were in a hotel suite after prom when the truth came out
the gang poses for more pictures in front of the limo
basically craig has been cheating on sam the whole time
when i heard that i kept thinking about the happy girl in these pictures
because she doesnt have days to go
the place is packed with graduating seniors and families
charlies mom and dad fawn over candace with the video camera
charlie finally finds
she made it
this is her time
and no one should be able to take that away
they approach each other and hug
oh charlies here
guys group photo
we should all take a group photo
get against the railing and try to look suave
the kids line up for the picture they will always remember
yeah this is the one
thats going to be a great angle
patrick bows to reveal the top of his cap reads nothing hates you
the parents line up cameras
the grandfather clock reads pm
the room is festive under streamers wishing sam luck at penn state
the kids sign each others yearbooks
charlie sees sam smile at old photos
he misses her already
at her going away party i wanted her to know about that night we went through the tunnel
and how for the first time i felt like i belonged somewhere
charlie doesnt know where the time keeps going
sam opens goodbye presents from her friends
and tomorrow shes leaving
so i wanted to give her a part of me
charlie watches sam pick up his present
she carefully peels the tape to reveal that charlie gave her all of his books
are these all your books charlie
they lock eyes and do not speak
the pictures are down
the dressers empty
the suitcase is open on the bed
charlie watches sam fold clothes and put them in her suitcase
he has promised himself he will not cry
even when she packs away his beatles of something
instead he looks at her and tries to remember every detail
her hair and brown eyes and sound of her voice
thanks for staying up with me
my brother said penn state has a restaurant called ye olde college diner
you have to get a grilled stickie on your first night
its a tradition
that sounds like fun
pretty soon youll have a whole new group of friends and you wont even think about this place anymore
yes i will
sam moves some suitcases over to the pile in the room
they stand next to each other
i had lunch with craig today
he said he was sorry and that i was right to break up with him
but im driving away and i just felt so small
just asking myself why do i and everyone i love pick people who treat us like were nothing
we accept the love we think we deserve
he says it sober
sam lets it sink in
charlie walks over to the bed to do more packing
then she turns to him
then why didnt you ever ask me out
charlie didnt expect that
he is silent
i uh i just didnt think you wanted that
well what did you want
i just want you to be happy
dont you get it charlie
i cant feel that
its really sweet and everything but you cant just sit there and put everybodys lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love
i dont want to be somebodys crush
i want people to like the real me
i know who you are sam
and charlie finally speaks from the heart
i know im quiet and i know i should speak more but if you knew the things that were in my head most of the time youd know what it
how much we are alike
and how weve been through the same things
and youre not small
he cant contain himself anymore
he moves to her and kisses her
move to the bed
charlies heart pounds
they sit on the bed
we see her fingertips
her hand on charlies knee
when she touches him charlie pulls away from her
like hes seen a ghost
it hits charlie like freezing water
whats wrong charlie
charlie shakes off whatever was bothering him and continues
its like a dream for charlie
he watches sam hug alice and mary elizabeth goodbye
but charlie is somewhere else
ill call all the time
and well all see each other in new york
come on sam
charlie cant take it
he moves to the side of the truck and puts in the last suitcase
he looks over at sam
charlie remembers kissing sam the night before
her hand touches charlies knee
charlie snaps himself out of it
he turns back as mary elizabeth and alice part ways
charlie locks eyes with sam
they take a moment
and then they come together to hug
she kisses him goodbye trying not to cry
after a moment sam climbs into the drivers seat of her truck with patrick riding shotgun
charlie looks dazed
charlie remembers pulling away from sam
like hes seen a ghost
whats wrong charlie
sam starts the truck
charlie wants to scream for her to stop
but hes frozen
she drives away
he watches her go
the truck gets smaller in the distance until it turns at the stop sign
charlie stands there alone
charlie remembers the night with sam
we see her put her hand on his knee
the image moves up the arm
to the shoulder
to the face
and we reveal we are not in sams bedroom
and it is not sam touching charlie
aunt helen dont wake your sister
the memory only registers as a small blink of his eye
charlie sees his friends are crying
charlie walks down the street
his eyes far away
the images and memories are short violent bursts
if youve never had an anxiety attack this is how it feels
its christmas eve
aunt helen smiles to little charlie
itll be our little secret okay
little charlie nods
back to present
charlie walks toward us on the sidewalk
we see him through a long lens
his image fractures
we see him in different planes of the image
hes beginning to break apart
little candace is asleep on the floor
aunt helen sits next to little charlie on the sofa
shes fast asleep
back to present
we see charlie fracturing
the pieces scattered
out of focus
hes all over the frame
aunt helen points to little candace
dont wake your sister
back to present
charlie enters his house
aunt helen gets hit by the semi truck
little charlies mom opens the door to reveal a policeman
back to present
charlie is in the same entry hall in the same house years later
banging his head against the wall
its my fault
its all my fault
he passes the photo wall on the stairs
we see the images of the family
years of history staring at us
ghosts on the wall
back to present
charlie sits at his desk
we see him from behind
trying to keep himself calm
charlie thinks everyone is staring at him
his sister and her friends
his brother and mother
mary elizabeth and alice
and worst of all
sam and patrick the night they toasted him
a paranoid nightmare
back to present
charlies falling to pieces
the tears run down his face
derek hits candace
patrick hits brad
the cafeteria erupts into violence
and charlie remembers what hes blacked out
we see him in the cafeteria
he thinks he sees aunt helen as he breaks the linebackers nose
hits another in the throat
and pushes another
charlie looks at his hand covered in blood
the whole school staring at him
back to present
charlie holds his head
trying to stuff the pictures back in his brain
but he cant
they keep coming and coming faster and faster
sams hand little charlie on top of the stairs the police telling him aunt helen is dead
itll be our little secret
we go behind his head
the image moves closer and closer
until it feels like we are inside charlies mind
we see candace hanging out with her girlfriends at a friends backyard pool
her friend pretty holds the cordless
your brothers on the phone
candace casually picks up the phone
sam and patrick left and um i just cant stop thinking something
candace i killed aunt helen didnt i
she died getting my birthday present so i guess i killed her right
ive tried to stop thinking that but i cant
she keeps driving away and dying over and over
candace looks like she got hit with ice water
she knows her brother
she knows this voice
candace covers the phone
call the police and send them to my house
and i cant stop her
im crazy again
no charlie listen to me
mom and dad are going to be home with chris any second
i was just thinking
what if i wanted her to die candace
we begin in the house
the entry hall
the empty bedroom
charlies typewriter on his desk
its all so quiet
and then we see charlie walking down the hallway
he turns the corner and enters the
charlie doesnt know where he is anymore
the past and present have bled together
we see little charlie turn the corner into the kitchen
back to present as year old charlie stands in the same kitchen breathing shallow
year old charlie walks up to aunt helen sitting at the kitchen table
back to present as year old charlie begins to have a full blown anxiety attack
year old charlie takes aunt helens hand and turns it over
to reveal her wrist scars
back to present as charlie looks from the table to the counter with the bread and the knives
he stares at the knives for a moment
the policemen break down the door
we see charlies reflection in the window
the door opens slowly and his psychiatrist dr
she finds him sitting in the corner
he has been crying
where am i
this news hits charlie hard
he begins to panic
you have to let me go
my dad cant afford it
dont worry about that
i saw them when i was little
and i dont want to be a mayview kid
just tell me how to stop it
all their lives
all the time
how do you stop seeing it
seeing what charlie
there is so much pain
and i dont know how to not notice it
whats hurting you
it never stops
do you understand
burton smiles sympathetic
charlie nods relieved that someone finally understands
what about your aunt helen
like cold water
what was tears is now confusion and soon to be shame
burton is gentle to him
what about her
can you see her
yes she had a terrible life
i mean what am i
you said some things about her in your sleep
i dont care
if you want to get better you have to charlie looks at her nodding her encouragement
the minute he says one word of truth he feels ashamed
he stops talking
burton does not press him
charlie are you going to let me help you here
charlie cries and nods
do you remember anything before you blacked out
i remember leaving sams house and walking home
we move away from them as charlies voice trails off
the sun creeps through the windows
we can hear birds outside
the intercom is quiet
charlie is alone
he looks at sams typewriter
dear friend is already typed
i was in the hospital for awhile
i wont go into detail about all of it
but i will say there were some very bad days
and some unexpected beautiful days
charlie picks up a get well card from sam
burton walks charlies parents down the hallway
the worst day was the time my doctor told my mom and dad what aunt helen did to me
in the distance we see charlies mom and dad stop
charlie looks up and sees his mom and dad in the doorway
his mother comes to hold him
im so sorry
for a second we see the emotion his father hides behind the sports page before he chokes it down
he walks over to his son and kisses his forehead
charlie chris and candace sit on the bed playing cards
the best days were those when i could have visitors
my brother and sister always came for those until chris had to go to training camp
hes going to be first string this year
and my sister told me she met a nice guy at her summer job
charlie leaves his room with his suitcase in hand
his mother waits in the hallway with dr
there he is
so ill see you thursday at right
charlie nods and leaves the hospital with his mother
my doctor said we cant choose where we can come from but we can choose where we go from there
i know its not all the answers but it was enough to start putting these pieces together
burton smiles then turns back into the hospital
the family sits at the dinner table
god bless this food that we are about to receive
we thank you for this bounty in the name of our lord jesus christ
after they say amen the room falls silent
the family is on pins and needles
no one touches their food
how do you think the penguins are going to do this year dad
god damn penguins
i think theyre allergic to god damn defense
what do the players call a puck again
are you sure its not a god damn biscuit
youre cruisin for a bruisin
as things return to normal dad picks up his paper
candace talks about the books shell need for college
everyone starts eating
and charlie smiles happy to just be home
the door opens to reveal patrick smiling
can charlie come out and play
charlies mother smiles
charlie smiles too
especially when he sees
standing next to patrick
her hair a little different
her eyes alive and happy
the gang of three sit at their booth
sam and patrick have their coffee
charlie has his brownie
that first night i had grilled stickies
it was so good
you have to visit in the fall
well have some
charlie has a breakdown scheduled for october
after a beat
well can i tell you something
ive been away for two months
its another world
and it gets better
off charlies smile and my roommate katie has the best taste in music
sam puts a cassette tape down on the table
i found the tunnel song
charlie looks at sam and patrick who smile
the three leave the restaurant and jump into sams truck
charlie in the middle
sam the passenger
i dont know if i will have the time to write any more letters because i might be too busy trying to participate
so if this does end up being the last letter i just want you to know that i was in a bad place before i started high school
and you helped me
the three friends are flying down the highway in sams truck
the music blaring
the wind making their hair dance
even if you didnt know what i was talking about
or know someone whos gone through it
it made me not feel alone
with sams help charlie climbs through the little window
charlie gets into the back of the truck
he sits down looking back at the highway
watching everywhere hes been
because i know there are people who say all of these things dont happen
and there are people who forget what its like to be when they turn
we see charlie in profile
the night sky behind him until
they enter the tunnel and we realize just how fast theyre driving
the white tiles of the tunnel whiz by at blinding speed
a perfect night
a perfect drive
i know these will all be stories someday
and our pictures will become old photographs
and well all become somebodys mom or dad
but right now these moments are not stories
charlie turns to face forward
to the moment
to sam smiling at him from the front seat
this is happening
i am here
and i am looking at her
and she is so beautiful
sam kisses charlie
then she turns and all three kids look ahead to everything in front of them
charlie begins to stand in the back of the truck
ready to leave the tunnel
i can see it
this one moment when you know youre not a sad story
you are alive
and as you stand up and see the lights on buildings and everything that makes you wonder
and you are listening to that song on that drive with the people you love most in this world
charlie stands in the back of the truck
the wind on his face
he is free
and in this moment i swear
we see the moment as charlie sees it
the tunnels exit getting bigger and brighter with the lights of the city behind it
we are infinite
the tunnel song blasts over the speakers as the truck flies out of the tunnel
sam and patrick scream with excitement
charlie holds his arms in the air
the weight of the world gone
if only for a moment
this one moment
we see the city
a million lights like white stars in a glass dome
we crane to the sky
we are in heaven
