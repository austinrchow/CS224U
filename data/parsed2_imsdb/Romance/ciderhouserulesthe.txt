written by john irving production draft an establishing shot of the rundown train station on an overcast morning
theres snow on the station platform
a train arrives and departs
in other parts of the world young men of promise leave home to make their fortunes battle evil or solve the problems of the world
behind the station at the top of the hill lies the st
i was myself such a young man when i came to save the orphanage in st
many years ago
a man and woman couple make their way toward the main entrance of the large brick building
here in st
clouds i have come to understand that promises are rarely kept that the battle isnt so much against evil as ignorance and that being successful cant hold a candle to
being of use
the couple enters the orphanage where we hear the sound of babies
nor have i solved the problem i came here to solve
two nurses edna and angela chase children a morning routine
even in the most enlightened times unwanted babies will manage to be born
that there will always be orphans is simple not a problem to be solved
here is st
clouds we dont regard the sordid facts of life as problems
the camera goes up the stairs with some of the kids
we enter an office where dr
larch shows couple their newly adopted son homer an infant who lies smiling in dr
in truth weve only had one real problem
we close in on the infant until his face fills the screen
his name was homer wells
larch hands over the infant to the adopting parents
i named him after the greek writer
you know homer of course
they dont look as if they read
i made his name wells because i could tell he was very deep
the parents look with pride at their adopted son
in truth nurse angela named him her father drilled wells and homer was one of her familys umpteen cats
at the front door larch and the nurses wave and call good bye to homer they close the door
the same door swings open its another night
the same couple is bringing homer back
there is concern in their faces as nurse edna lets them in
larch is delivering his benediction to the boys
good night you princes of maine you kings of new england
as he turns he is startled by nurse edna waiting with couple and baby homer
theres something wrong with him
he never makes a sound
larch looks quickly at homer
he didnt cry enough for them if you can believe it
do you think we could have a look at someone a little different
the mother hands over the baby to larch
baby homer lets out a happy squeal as soon as hes in larchs arms
the parents stare in disbelief
thus was homer wells returned
he was too happy a baby
angela and edna call and wave good bye to a two year old homer leaving with couple
larch stands on the porch and watches the family head down the hill
the second family has an unfortunate gift for getting sounds out of homer
larch bursts into the home of the second couple and lifts a crying and bruised homer out of his bed
there is rage in larchs eyes as he looks at the couple
the rumor was true
they beat him
he couldnt stop crying
larch carries homer up the orphanage hill
here is st
clouds i try to consider with each rule i make or break that my first priority is an orphans future
the naked belly of a very pregnant woman
easier said than done
a tiny hand comes in with a stethoscope and puts it on the big belly
young homers head with the stethoscope around his neck pops up behind the belly he closes his eyes as he concentrates on listening to the sounds of the unborn child
larch stops in the doorway catching sight of homer
he smiles faintly
the door opens to a third couple smiling at us welcoming and embracing a sixteen year old homer
behind them waits the would be stepsister an attractive girl a little older then homer
i told the third family to take good care this was a special boy
homer and the stepsister are in bed together
the parents burst in on them the father chasing homer around and around the bed the mother beating her daughter who covers herself with a pillow
it was homer who took too much good care of himself
from her window the stepsister watches homer leave the house carrying his suitcase
homer looks up at her as he walks to the street
its after dawn but still a little dark as homer walks to the orphanage door suitcase in hand
a hugely pregnant woman arrives at the same time
they stand awkwardly next to each other waiting for someone to answer the door
the woman is crying
homer reaches out and takes her hand
dont be frightened
everyone is nice here
do you live here
i just belong here
the woman sniffles she nods vaguely
the door opens
nurse edna lets the woman in and embraces homer
what could i do with him
he kept coming back
larch instructs an older homer from grays anatomy
homer is bored and looks out the window
homer if youre going to stay at st
clouds i expect you to be of use
homer looks adoringly at dr
larch as larch examines another pregnant woman
larch waves homer over he places the boys hand on the womans abdomen to feel the fetus kicking
but in failing to withhold love had i created a true and everlasting orphan
i had been too successful with homer wells
i had managed to make the orphanage his home
larch closes a door quickly behind him so that homer doesnt see the abortion patient in the o
homer assists larch in delivering a baby
homer carries a white enamel pail to the incinerator
he looks inside the pail he stops
god forgive me
i have made an orphan by loving him too much
homer wells will belong to st
hold on homers disgusted expression as he stares at the contents of the pail
end title sequence
we hear a song playing on an old phonograph
we see the song playing on the old phonograph
larch is taking ether
he holds the bottle in one hand the cone over his mouth and nose with the other
when larch dozes off his hand loosens its grip on the cone the cone falls off his face and he wakes up
then he puts the cone back in place dripping more ether from the bottle to the gauze covering the cone
pan the dispensary which also serves as larchs photo gallery and bedroom apartment
the ether bed is separated from the room by a hospital curtain the kind on casters
we see the recording revolving the glass encased cabinets of medical supplies the old photographs of st
homer enters he stands uncomfortably watching larch for a moment
then he turns around and walks back into the corridor
homer calls out as though hes just coming down the corridor
larch wakes up he shakes off the ether haze
weve got two new patients one to deliver
larch and homer leave together
the two doctors walk briskly down the hall a couple of professionals
yes for both
sarcastically i presume youd prefer handling the delivery
tiredly an old topic all i said was i dont want to perform abortions
i have no argument with you performing them
you know how to help these women how can you not feel obligated to help them when they cant get help anywhere else
one its illegal
two i didnt ask how to do it you just showed me
what else could i have showed you homer
the only thing i can teach you is what i know
in every life youve got to be of use
homer and larch split off and disappear into two different operating rooms
as he goes homer mumbles to himself of use of use of use
larch and angela are preparing the ether for dorothy a not visibly pregnant woman
the sounds of labor across the hall can be heard over
holds the cone have you ever had ether dorothy
once when they took out my appendix
looks for scar no ones touched your appendix
whatever it was
the ether made me sick
it wont make you sick this time dorothy not the way i do it just a drop at a time
i cant pay for this you know i got no money
one day dorothy if you have any money a donation to the orphanage would be very much appreciated
only if you can afford it
holds the ether bottle try to think of nothing dorothy
angela puts the cone over dorothys mouth and nose larch drips the ether on the cone
a newborn wails in the other o
homer has delivered carla
a newborn baby is screaming in ednas arms
homer is attending to carla who is panting
that was good carla that was perfect
i dont wanna see it
you dont have to see it dear
i dont even wanna know what sex it is dont tell me
we wont tell you carla
youre going to be okay
your babys going to be okay too
i dont wanna know
larch pops into the delivery room he peers at the baby
hes a big boy
let me see him for christs sake i wanna see him
edna shows the baby to carla who stares then turns away
larch whispers to homer
would you mind having a look at dorothy
angela sits with the still etherized dorothy while larch and homer confer over a basin containing dorothys uterus
there was no visible wound
the fetus was dead
her uterus was virtually disintegrating my stitches pulled right through the tissue
mystified it looks like scurvy
derisively sarcastic scurvy
ah yes the curse of the old time sailor suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables
homer dorothy isnt a sailor
shes a prostitute isnt she
to angela did you look in her purse
frustrated i looked everywhere else
angela hands larch a bottle of brown liquid
its called french lunar solution
larch wrinkles his nose at the odor
its not ergot its not pituitary extract its not oil of rue
it claims to restore monthly regularity
its obviously an aborticide
larch wets his finger with the stuff then touches it to his tongue
spits christ its oil of tansy
i dont know it
if you take enough of it your intestines lose their ability to absorb vitamin c
in other words scurvy
and you call yourself not a doctor
to angela keep an eye on her shes in trouble
as homer turns to leave larch stops him he points to the basin
take care of that will you
homer stops annoyed he picks up the basin and empties the contents into a white enamel pail
miss titcomb is teaching math to some distracted boys and girls in a corner of the dining room
a blackboard on wheels is a mass of numbers
homer passing through the dining room with the white enamel pail attracts the attention of buster a sixteen year old who is picking over a plate of pastries on a
buster immediately goes with homer
ill help you
homer shakes his head keeps walking
larch passes close to buster
buster makes a face disgusted
buster and homer tramp through the snow toward the incinerator
homer still carries the pail
he sniffs that ether
ive seen him do it
its because hes too tired to sleep
he has to
he smells like he could put you to sleep
hes a doctor buster doctors smell like ether
youre a doctor homer you dont smell like ether
im not a doctor
i havent been to medical school i havent even been to high school
but youve studied with the old man for years
im not a doctor
im sorry homer
buster stands watching as homer empties the pail into the incinerator
with his head inclined to the giant ear of larchs phonograph fuzzy six thin and pale and looking remarkably like an embryo is listening to a recording
he cant hear what larch and homer are saying about him as they construct a humidified tent over a small hospital bed on wheels
the humidifier is operated by a car battery
fuzzy is not uncommon
i tell you theres something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers
they seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along
i havent read that
i havent either
but you will
the morons who write the books should do a little research here
but isnt fuzzy just
when doesnt he have bronchitis
i wouldnt call his bronchial infections underdeveloped
larch plucks fuzzy from in front of the phonograph and zips him into the breathing tent
as larch leaves mary agnes a pretty but tough looking teenager comes into the dispensary
what is it mary agnes
mary agnes smiles at homer then she sticks her tongue out at him
homer looks at her impassively but as the moment continues his expression suggests his annoyance
fuzzy starts to cough he wheezes as he breathes
homer leans down he peers at fuzzy through a hole by the zipper of the tent
garbled because of her tongue look
homer examines mary agnes tongue
did you bite it
i dont remember
dismissively it looks like you bit it itll be all right
maybe i was kissing someone and he bit me
looks at her tongue again no you did it yourself
maybe in your sleep
i must have been dreaming of kissing someone
homer is not responding to her come on
he wheels fuzzy into the hall
story time fuzzy
in the girls bunk room nurse edna is saying prayers
the girls lie with their palms pressed together on their chests
oh lord support us all the day long
the building of st
clouds is silhouetted against the sky
carla the woman we saw deliver the baby is heading down the hill alone she sobs not looking back
until the shadows lengthen and the evening comes and the busy world is hushed and the fever of life is over and our work is done
in the bunk room again with edna and the girls
then in thy mercy grant us save lodging and holy rest and peace at the last
larch is reading from oliver twist the death scene of bill sikes dog
the boys listen in horror in their beds
a dog which had lain concealed till now ran backwards and forwards on the parapet with a dismal howl and collecting himself for a spring jumped for the dead mans
homer enters he walks quietly to his bed in the far corner of the room where he starts to undress
missing his aim he fell into a ditch turning completely over as he went and striking his head against a stone dashed his brains out
larch turns out the lights
from the open doorway to the hall larch delivers his nightly benediction
good night you princes of maine
you kings of new england
larch closes the door leaving them in the semi darkness
one young boy runs into homers bed nervously giggling
in his breathing tent why does dr
larch do tht every night
about seven maybe to scare us
about eleven no you jerk
about nine dr
larch loves us
but why does he do that
he does it because we like it
the boys silently agree homer among them
the girls led by mary agnes round a corner of the orphanage towing a sled piled high with snowballs
buster is mine
you two get copperfield and curly
nobody touches fuzzy
they shriek as the boys suddenly surprise them
buster throws two hard snowballs that hit mary agnes and clara eight or nine before mary agnes overwhelms him and repeatedly sticks his head in the snow
copperfield terrified of mary agnes escapes
curly misses then tips over the sled of snowballs as clara and the adorable hazel five or six throw him to the ground
fuzzy drops his one snowball he runs aimlessly in circles coughing as nurse edna explodes from a door of the orphanage
share the snowballs
mouth full of snow theyre our snowballs
they stole them
they attacked us just like the japs
fuzzy coughs and wheezes trying to catch his breath
listen to you fuzzy
youve been running
you get to the shower
a new couple comes up the hill
the orphans stop and stare brushing snow off themselves struggling to make themselves look presentable
curly is desperate to look his best
mary agnes doesnt bother to pretty herself
she whispers to clara and hazel
i know the type theyll take one of the babies
the children are eating breakfast as the would be parents walk around the tables looking over the assembled orphans
curly works on his table manners he forks and eats a piece of pancake with elegance
angela and edna try to make the couple slow down by the older children but the couple stop and stare at the adorable hazel
larch and homer are examining the babies
the doctors are checking the babies grips their eyes ears and throats
angela appears in the doorway
wilbur the adopting couple is waiting in your office
irritated life is waiting
larch looks at the next babys record attached to the bed
wheres the name sheet
nobodys named this one yet
its my turn
homer is tired of this game
larch touches the childs forehead with his index finger
henceforth you shall be
the baby starts to cry
he doesnt like it
looks at the record hes a boy thats why
cant a boy be a dorrit
i dont think so
you do it then
homer points his finger at the childs forehead like a gun
henceforth you shall be
im not crazy about the little
homer is writing the name
okay hes just a wilbur then
we havent had a wilbur here in a year or so have we
we used to have dozens
they are interrupted by copperfield who comes running from the corridor
they picked hazel
the idiots chose hazel
hazel is being fussed over by edna
hazel clutches a cardboard suitcase and a tattered rag doll
mary agnes by far the oldest sits on a bed
if people want to adopt one of us they should have to take the oldest first
please mary agnes
this is hazels special day dont make her feel sad
hazels practically the youngest of us
she should be the last to leave
at least hazel can talk
usually they take one of the stupid babies
they take the babies so they wont ever have to tell them that they were orphans
begins to cry im not a baby
if you cry hazel theyll just send you back
mary agnes thats not true
hazel cries harder
thats what they did to me
you wanted to come back thats why you cried
to hazel you can cry if you feel like it hazel
you cry as much as you want
homer is in the corridor outside the office overhearing larchs lecture to the couple adopting hazel
it is strictly for our orphans sake that i destroy any record of their natural mothers
of course they will one day want to know
but orphans especially should look forward to their futures
not back to their pasts
homer sees curly standing all alone by a window in the corridor a suitcase is next to him
you going somewhere
curly shakes his head
i thought they might take me
they wanted a girl
nobody ever wants me
homer embraces curly and lifts him up he grabs the suitcase and continues down the corridor
youre one of the best curly we couldnt let just anyone take you
larch wouldnt let just anyone take any of us
nobodys asked for me have they
nobody special enough curly
you mean somebody asked
only the right people can have you curly
homer disappears into the boys bunk room carrying curly and his suitcase leaving the corridor empty
faces in the windows the orphans watch hazel walking across the snowy lawn with her new parents
edna with the girls gives her good bye blessing to hazel
let us be happy for hazel
hazel has found a family
good night hazel
good night hazel
good night hazel
good night hazel
the front door opens
the orphans excitedly run outside onto the green lawn into the warm weather of spring
angela is singing along with the song on the phonograph a more romantic song then before which rouses larch from his ether
he is grumpy but she sings the song in his ear and wont give him back the ether cone he rolls away from her but she tickles him and bites
his ear coaxing him into a more playful mood
i was dreaming about you
how beautiful you were
you werent dreaming about me
playfully she slips out of his embrace
then i wasnt beautiful
it was fantastic
it was just the ether wilbur
homer wheels a tray with glasses of water between the beds
a distraught pregnant woman stops him by her bed
are you okay
can i get you anything
no one but me ever put a hand on me to feel that baby
dont you want to touch it or put your ear down to it
homer touches the womans belly
put your ear there
homer cautiously lays his ear against her belly
you shouldnt have a baby if theres no one who wants to put his face right there
she holds homers head against her belly she presses his face into her
she shuts her eyes
homers eyes stare widely
larch stops in the doorway he watches with concern
stay right there
right where you are
stay right here
homer at the train station staring down the empty tracks
buster is hanging around with him kicking a rock
do you ever think about leaving this place to go find them
homer makes no response
as the train approaches homer and buster go sit on a loading cart
they see the distraught woman no longer pregnant from homers experience of a few nights ago she is leaving st
clouds without her baby waiting for the approaching train
her face is a mask
the disapproving stationmaster gives her a hard look
i mean your parents
i know who you mean
i think about leaving here but not to find them
whoever they were they didnt do any of the things parents are supposed to do
larch did those things and nurse edna and nurse angela
but sometimes i wish i could meet mine anyway
what for buster
what would you do if you met them
id like to show them that i can cook a little
you cook very well
and that i can drive a truck
laughing better than i can
sometimes i want to meet them so i can kill them
buster is ashamed he knows hes said the wrong thing
homer you know i would never kill anyone you know i wouldnt
the slowly moving train has stopped
there are soldiers leaning out the windows
buster turns to see mary agnes walking past the train shes doing her best to look grown up sophisticated
one of the soldiers reaches out and gently tugs on her hair
mary agnes is enraged she spits at the soldier
i think mary agnes could kill someone
i doubt it
shes just an
mary agnes spits at all the soldiers
the soldiers roll up the windows as mary agnes improvises some verbal abuse
whats she so emotional about
shrugs i dont know
she got left here like the rest of us didnt she
camera closes on homer
the orphans are watching king kong the part when the giant ape first captures the screaming fay wray
intercut kong with the orphans rapt faces
homer sits near the front mesmerized by the film
larch and angela sit by the projector larch is reading a letter
fuzzy points to the screen
coughing he thinks shes his mother
king kong is undressing fay wray in the cave
he doesnt think shes his mother fuzzy
he does so
he loves her
how could she be his mother
larch shakes the letter in front of angela
a harsh whisper they want to replace me
the board of trustees wants to replace me
whispering back they just want you to hire some new help
some new things would be useful
i dont need any new help
the film breaks to huge cries of disappointment from the orphans
fuzzy coughs and coughs while larch fumbles with the projector
angela turns on the light while larch squints at the broken film
the orphans are chanting kong
i need you
homer gets up and walks to the projector
i thought you took care of this
it always breaks in the same place
its your splice isnt it
angry its your splice
you blame me for everything
larch abruptly lets go of the film
angela we need a new movie a new projector a new typewriter thats what they should replace around here
edna comes in she speaks to larch then quickly leaves
we have a delivery
imminent in my estimation
larch turns to homer
homer would you get this one
homer shifts his weight to the other foot aggravated he stands there
shes a patient right
she should see a doctor
homer and larch stare at each other
trying to stay calm homer you are a skilled and gifted surgeon
you have near prefect obstetrical and gynecological procedure
homer is also trying to avoid a fight
i just mean id rather fix the movie
larch cant hide his disappointment
it is an uneasy peace
homer is adjusting fuzzys breathing tent as the other boys climb into bed
doesnt king kong think the woman is his mother
uh sure thats what kong thinks all right
thats why kong loves her
larch comes in and walks over to homer and fuzzy
larch and homer exchange a look
i thought it was my turn
ill get this
you go ahead
homer sits down with david copperfield
there is quiet anticipation while homer readies himself to read
reading whether i shall turn out to be the hero of my own life or whether that station will be held by anybody else these pages must show
larch continues to adjust fuzzys breathing tent
i was a posthumous child
my fathers eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months when mine opened on it
whispers to larch his fathers dead right
whispering back thats right fuzz
close on fuzzy
continues reading there is something strange to me even now in the reflection that he never saw me
as larch bends over fuzzy to fix the breathing apparatus fuzzy whispers
is your father dead
nods whispers cirrhosis its a disease of the liver
liver killed him
alcohol killed him he drank himself to death
but did you know him
it hardly mattered that i knew him
did you know your mother better
nods still whispers shes dead now too
she was a nanny
whats a nanny do
she looks after other peoples children
did you grow up around here
she was an immigrant
whats an immigrant
someone not from maine
the orphanage in moonlight
not a sound
the children are chasing a ball near the incinerator
a very frightened girl not one of the orphans is lying next to the incinerator
edna kneels by the strange girl who cringes with fear
no ones going to hurt you dear
have you come to visit us
we have beds you know
have you had any breakfast
whats your name
the girl wont speak when edna touches the girls forehead she pulls back her hand in alarm
edna is holding the head of the frightened young girl
the girl is feverishly hot and whimpering she keeps looking at her feet in the stirrups as if shes an animal caught in a trap
larch and homer stand on either side of her
her temperature is a hundred and four
very gently how old are you dear
the girl shakes her head
the pain stabs her again
are you twelve dear
the girl nods you have to tell me how long youve been pregnant
the girl freezes three months
another stab of pain contorts the girl
are you four months pregnant
the girl holds her breath while he examines her abdomen homer very delicately examines the girls abdomen too
whispers to larch shes at least five
the girl goes rigid as larch bends into position
dear child it wont hurt when i look
im just going to look
homer assists larch with the speculum
tell me you havent done something to yourself have you
it wasnt me
did you go to someone else
he said he was a doctor
i would never have stuck that inside me
stuck what inside you
homer holds the girl still she is babbling on and on while larch is examining her
it wasnt me
i would never do no such thing
i wouldnt stick that inside me
it wasnt me
larch his wild eye peering into the speculum makes an audible gasp from the shock of what he sees inside the girl
larch tells homer to have a look
larch then whispers something to edna she brings the ether bottle and cone quickly
larch starts putting the cone in place over the nose and mouth of the frightened girl
homer bends to the speculum
to the twelve year old listen youve been very brave
im going to put you to sleep you wont feel it anymore
youve been brave enough
homer stares into the speculum he closes his eyes
the girl is resisting the ether but her eyelids flutter closed
thats a heavy sedation
you bet its a heavy sedation
the fetus is unexpelled her uterus is punctured she has acute peritonitis and theres a foreign object
i think its a crochet hook
homer has pulled off his surgical mask
he leans over the scrub sink splashing cold water on his face
to homer if shed come to you four months ago and asked you for a simple d and c what would you have decided to do
this is what doing nothing gets you homer
it means that someone else is going to do the job some moron who doesnt know how
homer furious leaves the operating room
edna lifts the girls eyelids for larch so that he can see how well under the ether she is
i wish youd come to me dear child
you should have come to me instead
homer storms down the hall then stops pulling off his white coat
angry pacing he kicks at nothing
buster and homer are digging the pit
larch paces by the coffin of the year old girl
whatd she die of
inhales deeply she died of secrecy she died of ignorance
buster nods but hes totally bewildered
to homer if you expect people to be responsible for their children you have to give them the right to decide whether or not to have children
wouldnt you agree
buster doesnt get it
homer has heard this too many times he rolls his eyes
how about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with
how about this child
you expect her to be responsible
homer looks away
i didnt mean her
im talking about
annoyed you know who i mean
larch studies him
buster is driving the old pickup truck with the shovels and a wheelbarrow in the back
larch and homer are in the cab they are being bounced all over the cab by busters wild driving
larch looks at homer he stares at him with a curious smile
larch says nothing
homer gives him a look
smiling its just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people
im happy i amuse you
to homer try to look at it this way
what choice does buster have
what are his options
nobody will ever adopt him
buster considers this try to look at it this way
buster and i are sitting right here beside you
we could have ended up in the incinerator
buster grins happy to be alive under any circumstances is that your point
buster is distracted he drives the truck into a ditch and it bounces around missing a tree by an inch
he is up on the road again in a few seconds
happy to be alive
i guess so
they are all distracted by a luxurious convertible that overtakes them on the hill to the orphanage
the fast car is driven by a handsome man in the uniform of the army air corps a young officer
from the passenger seat a beautiful young woman smiles at them rendering them speechless
the luxurious convertible now parked has drawn all the orphans to it
the handsome young officer wally and the beautiful young woman candy stand confused by the car they are surrounded by the curious orphans with whom they are painfully self conscious
they are overly friendly to the children as they are anxious of larch and homer and buster in their gravedigging attire who are getting out of the truck
nervously wally gives the children chocolates
so many children
are they all orphans
well this is an orphanage
the kids climb into wallys car
oh theyre getting into the car
watch your fingers
curly tugs on candys dress staring up at her his face already smeared with chocolate
im the best
sweetly you are
good with kids the best
the best at what
im the best one
curlys nose is streaming snot
candy kneels beside him and holds her handkerchief to his nose
curly tries to talk while shes holding his nose
i really am the best i just have a cold
there i bet that feels better
the other orphans are dying with envy candy is so beautiful
some like buster are torn between candy and the car
curly come here
to larch tell them
im the one
virtually all the orphans have climbed into wallys car
to wally im sorry
theyre not used to seeing a car like this
its okay i dont mind
larch scowling presents himself to the new couple
we brought some chocolates for the kids
larch picks up curly and carries him toward the boys division
im the best
youre the best curly
homer is seated in the desk chair
the impressive couple sit in front of him
wally jumps up to his feet to shake homers hand
wally sits down
the three sit still for an awkward moment
to candy how many months are you
homer writes on a piece of paper
candy and wally exchange a worried look
so now uh
i mean do you do the no
larch will be performing the procedure
relieved ah well
i just wondered
edna pokes her head in the door
excuse me homer
larch said this one is your turn
edna quickly sees that all three of them have misunderstood her
oh dear im sorry
i meant the circumcision
that boy you delivered on tuesday
have you prepped him
ill get started
candy and wally cant conceal how impressed they are with the young homer
homer walks down the corridor dressed in his operating gown as the door to the o
opens and wally stumbles out hurriedly opening a window
wally breathes deeply to regain his composure
i think it was the ether the smell got to me
this is all my fault
edna comes down the hall with a dirt stained crying curly whos covering one eye
over the din steerforth got into the pantry hes eaten all the pie dough
sobbing he wasnt sharing it either
hes down the hall throwing up
homer nods to edna who is marching off with curly
wally smiles at homer
what kind of plane are you flying
a b liberator
have you enlisted
they wouldnt take me
im class iv ive got a heart defect
is it serious
no its not serious
im just not supposed to get excited
you know no strain no stress
i try to keep calm all the time
wally hears homers facetiousness how tired he is of his heart condition
i dont imagine theres any strain or stress around here
homer appreciates the joke
the door to the operating room that wally exited opens into the corridor candy is being wheeled out on a gurney by larch and angela
wally rushes to candys side
homer follows slowly
candy is groggy coming out of the ether
how is she doing
slurred speech boy or girl
it was nothing its all over
its all over honey
they walk candy on her gurney
homer looks after them
slurred speech i would like to have a baby one day
i really would
why of course you can have as many children as you want
im sure youll have very beautiful children
larch wheels candy behind a curtain
youll have princes of maine
youll have kings of new england
larch has a different tone of voice when he speaks to wally
i suggest you find yourself some fresh air lieutenant
wally is left alone in the corridor
cranked at three quarters fuzzy sits in bed wheezing and coughing
hes drawing with great intensity using crayons on a piece of paper held by a clipboard
homer sits on the end of fuzzys bed cleaning up steerforth
homer pauses to look out of the window he sees wally dashing and spotless in his uniform beside his flashy car
a life homer might have had crosses his face
homer when is halloween
homer turns to fuzzy who holds up his picture a big pumpkin with a jack o lantern face
its the end of october
is that soon
homer looks at fuzzy his little body is working hard just to breathe
thats a few months away fuzz
to homer i still dont feel so good
its the best time
how come we only get pumpkins once a year
fuzzy coughs and coughs
dont get too excited fuzzy
why cant we have pumpkins for christmas too
we dont get any good presents at christmas anyway
homer looks out the window at wally again
his decision forms
homer approaches the flashy car where wally is still pacing
has anyone offered you anything to eat
actually someone did
i just didnt think i could eat anything
an awkward silence which homer covers by examining the car
trying to sound casual i wonder if you might give me a ride
be glad to
a ride where
unprepared where are you going
were heading back to cape kenneth
homer nods but he has no idea where cape kenneth is
that sounds fine
homer runs up the stairs two steps at a time he races into a corridor at full speed exhilarated
larch appears in front of him
homer stops abruptly out of breath unable to speak
as homer stands guiltily larch rifles through an x ray file holding various x rays up to the lit screen
he quickly finds the one hes looking for attaching it briefly to the screen for a confirming look a heart x ray which larch waves at homer as he talks
sarcastic doubtless youll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least useful thing it is that you find to do
restrained i wasnt intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless i expect ill find some ways to be of use
in other parts of the world i suppose there are other ways
still restrained of course
blows up are you really so stupid that you imagine youre going to find a more gratifying life
what youre going to find is people like the poor people who get left here only nobody takes care of them as well
and you wont be able to take care of them either
theres no taking care of anybody not out there
feeling trapped you know im grateful for everything youve done for me
calmly i dont need your gratitude
larch hands homer the heart x ray
exasperated i dont need this i know all about my condition
its your heart you ought to take it with you
camera closes on homer with the x ray
buster and mary agnes are serving the evening meal while larch rails at angela and edna who are helping buster and mary agnes
the sound of children in the dining hall is intermittent and chaotic
does he have a plan of some kind
will he be back soon
i dont know
hes just leaving to angela youre the one who says he needs to see the world
to edna thats what hell do hell see the world
stunned hes leaving
hell need clothes
let him try to make some money
thats part of seeing the world isnt it
angrily oh just stop it
you knew this was going to happen
hes a young man
almost breaking hes still a boy out in the world hes still a boy
just find him some clothes wilbur
he could use some clothes
camera closes on larch fighting tears
homer is packing his things we see the heart x ray and some photos of larch and edna and angela
larch approaches homer with a small bundle of clothes
gently almost reverently i think these will fit you
homer is grateful and ashamed
before he can speak edna is there a wad of bills in her hand
she tries to put the money in his pocket when he refuses it she simply puts the money in his open suitcase stuffing the bills under his clothes
youll need some money just a little something until you find a job
larch and edna retreat from him humbly as if they were his servants
as homer puts his stuff in the truck of wallys car angela cant resist touching his face
she is too upset to speak
from a window larch is watching the departure
he sees homer saying goodbye to the children embracing them
from another window fuzzy just stares
of course hes coughing
we see wally carrying candy to the car
groggy im okay i can walk
i dont want you to walk i want to carry you
should i put the top up
it might get cold
no keep it down
i want to feel the air
she speaks to homer touching his sleeve like a sleepy person as wally puts her gently in the backseat
still groggy coming with us
its always a good idea to have a doctor along for the ride
homer gets in the passenger seat beside wally who starts the car suddenly there is curly
homer cant look at curly who looks betrayed
edna picks up curly and carries him to the passenger side window
curly is sobbing
i have to go curly
to edna i couldnt find buster
will you tell him
he cant finish what he has to say
edna kisses him good bye
from the window larch watches the car leave
buster whittling a stick isnt watching
there is quiet as the journey gets underway
wally keeps glancing at candy in the rear view mirror she seems distant lost in thought
homer is taking everything in the speed the road the wind in his face
angela speaks to the boys
let us be happy for homer wells
in the girls washroom in front of the mirror by the row of sinks mary agnes is repeatedly slapping her face
angelas benediction to the boys plays over this scene of violent self abuse
except for the sound of the slaps
mary agnes doesnt make a sound
homer wells has found a family
good night homer
good night homer
on his bed larch is taking ether
we hear the refrain from the boys in the bunk room over
good night homer
good night homer
good night homer wells
the radio is playing
candy is lying down her knees drawn up in the backseat she appears to be asleep oblivious to homer and wallys conversation
actually the army has given me leave twice
first when my father died and now im on leave to help my mother im just trying to get her ready for the harvest
shes no farmer
apples were my dads business
and with the war on shes short on pickers
candys eyes are open but her voice is groggy
to homer wally thinks apples are boring
to homer i never said they were boring
you said apples arent exactly flying
well they arent
homer looks back at candy
her eyes close
i think id probably like the apple business
youre a little overqualified arent you
no im not
i need a job
the only jobs are picking jobs
picking apples is truly boring
candys eyes snap open and she sits up a little
you said it was boring
well picking them is
its about as exciting as
candy seems irritated with wally
homer tries to engage her
is your family in the apple business too
no but i work there i like it
my dads a lobsterman
ive never seen a lobster
ive never seen the ocean either
amazed youve never seen the ocean
homer shakes his head smiles
thats not funny
the car is parked at the side of the road
wally is half hidden behind a tree
candy and homer are left alone in the car theres an awkward silence as homer pretends not to hear wallys excessive peeing
suddenly candy starts to sob
i couldnt have a baby with someone whos leaving me i didnt know what else to do
homer is a doctor hes used to postabortion reactions
hes going to be dropping bombs on mandalay
theyre going to be shooting at him
i cant have a baby alone
i dont even know if hes coming back
he doesnt really
wally leans over candy to hug her
of course ill come back
candy pounds on his chest with her fists
you dont know wally
you have no idea
wally backs away
candy sobs uncontrollably
stay away from me
wally signals to homer to get out of the car
later wally and homer stand outside the car overhearing candys weeping
homer is smoking nervously
strictly medical this is all normal
the abortion procedure
it affects you
its the ether too
itll take a little time
i dont have any time
theres a war
its all very normal
wally looks at homer who takes a nervous drag on his cigarette
you ought to cut that shit out its terrible for you
homer looks at wally he sees the authority in his eyes
homer drops his cigarette and puts it out with his foot
they notice that candy has stopped crying
wally finds candy asleep in the backseat
the lone car on the road
snatches of war news from the radio are the only sound as the headlights illuminate the dark highway
the car is parked with homer sleeping in it alone
the sounds of the ocean increase as homer opens his eyes
homer gets out of the car and walks toward the beach enchanted
there it is his first view ever of an ocean the horizon the sun glimmering on the water
candy is lying on a blanket in the sand
wally is throwing rocks in the water
homer takes it all in
when candy calls for him homer walks up to her
im a little worried about the
she gestures below her waist about how much bleeding is okay
it should taper off tomorrow but it can come back again
you have cramps
candy nods theyll ease up almost entirely
as long as the bleeding isnt heavy its normal
a football comes flying through the air toward homer it bounces off his chest
meaning the football give it here
homer throws the football its clear hes never thrown one before
what was that
come over here
homer runs over to wally who proceeds to show him how to pass the ball
snatches of his instruction drift to candy who closes her eyes
put your fingers on the laces no it rests in your palm like this
you want the laces up yes like that
homer and wally sit on the beach a short distance from candys blanket
she appears to be asleep
wally looks in her direction before he speaks to homer
its called the burma run
its about a seven hour round trip flight between india and china
wally draws a crude map in the sand
burma run because you fly over burma
and over the himalayas
thats called flying over the hump
on candys face shes not asleep shes listening
at what altitude
ive got thirty five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet thats the first mountain pass
homer looks at wally thoughtfully
what lousy luck i mean your orders
to draw an assignment like that
conspiratorially actually i volunteered
homer is shocked he looks back at candy lowers his voice
its the flying right
you love to fly dont you
wally nods he also gives a look in candys direction before he responds
i love the bombing too
but theres also the himalayas they have the most wicked air currents in the world
i wouldnt miss flying there for anything
homers smile suggests that hes impressed but that he wouldnt have wallys enthusiasm for the task
wally laughs and puts his hand on homers shoulder
if youre serious about wanting a job picking apples isnt that boring
oh i would love that wally
the car is parked at a lobster pound
homer sits in the car watching wally carrying candys bag to the door
candy stands outside the car she shakes homers hand
i guess ill see you around the orchards
thanks for everything
ill see you around
candy turns and heads toward the house to catch up with wally
a lobsterman in his boat is approaching the dock
its ray candys father
homer glances at candy and wally on the dock kissing good bye
whispering i love you wally
i love you too
see you tomorrow
wally drives up to the worthington house he gets out of the car
homer sits in the car admiring the beautiful farmhouse
you have to meet my mom
conspiratorially if it comes up ive been at a wedding
thats where i met you at the wedding
homer as never seen such a room the sports trophies the photos of athletic teams and of candy with wally
model airplanes are everywhere
worthingtons voice comes from the hall
i expected you earlier
she appears in the doorway of wallys room
worthington olive is an elegant fiftyish new englander as handsome as wally but more reserved
she is surprised to see homer
this is homer wells hes the most overqualified apple picker youll ever meet but hes dying to learn the apple business
wally is taking his uniform off as he speaks just dropping it on the floor as he quickly puts on some farm clothes
how do you do homer wells
homer has never met anyone like her
how do you do
worthington starts picking up her sons uniform from the floor
she is politely curious about homer
were you a friend of the bride or the groom
homer looks confused he seems to have forgotten about the alleged wedding
wally puts his arm around homer urging him into the hall
homer is everybodys friend mom
the brides the grooms mine candys everybodys
homer is embarrassed but olive is obdurately well mannered
well perhaps youll come to dinner homer
wally calls to her as he pushes homer down the hall
not tonight mom hes got to meet mr
homer and wally get out of the jeep at the cider house a barnlike building with adjacent sheds and behind it line after line of trees the apple orchards
homer sees an outdoor shower where three black men are showering
it is a wooden stall that leaves the showers occupants visible above and below their midsections
a fourth black man is caught naked running behind the cider house and out of sight as he wraps a towel around himself
you already used up the hot water
youre usin my soap aint you
i aint usin no soap its too cold to bother with soap
there aint never enough hot water soap or no soap
no clue migrants
they pick fruit all kinds
they travel up and down the coast with the seasons
leaning close to homer the trick to mr
rose is you have to let him be the boss
homer wonders what that means as wally reaches for the door of the cider house
before wally can knock a pretty young black girl rose rose bumps open the screen door with her hip and throws a bucket of water in the grass almost hitting
homer and wally
that sinks backed up again wally
i thought you was gonna get me a plumber
rose this is homer homer this is mr
roses daughter rose
pretty aint it
you a plumber
no no homer is a new picker
hes going to stay here with you
this gets the attention of the men on their way from the showers
they walk over towels around their waists
suspiciously hes stayin here
the screen door swings open and shut again startling them all as mr
rose comes out of the cider house
that daughter of mine sure is miss hospitality aint she wally
rose shakes wallys hand
rose rose goes back inside the cider house as mr
rose shakes homers hand
homer introduces himself
you got lots of experience pickin i suppose
homers got no experience arthur but hes smarter then i am
hes a fast learner
rose looks briefly at the men who wait for his reaction
this is history
aint that what youre sayin wally
i guess we makin history
havin this young man stay with us
wally slaps homer on the back he goes inside the cider house to help rose rose with the plumbing
over his shoulder see you later
homer looks at mr
rose for instructions
rose stares back at him with his enigmatic smile
what should i do now
out back theres a shed
its just a mess
if that shed was better organized i could put my truck in there
homer looks at mr
rose with an uncomprehending expression
if youre as smart as wally says you know you sometimes gotta do one job before you do another
homer thinks that over
later homer is cleaning out the shed
the pickers all sit down to supper around a picnic table
homer with mr
rose rose rose and the other black pickers
rose takes an apple from a bowl on the table
then he pulls out a knife and opens it in one fluid motion hes so fast the knife seems to come out of nowhere
he begins to peel the apple
homer eyes mr
rose but mr
roses focus is riveted to his apple and the long perfect strand of peel dangling from it
you did a good job with that shed homer
peaches breaks the awkward silence
what kind of a name is homer
its the name of a cat
well not originally
homer decides to stop
now now we all got names sensible or not
to homer peaches is from georgia where we met him pickin peaches
hes still better with peaches than hs is with apples
peaches grins jack here is new
and this here is hero cause he was a hero of some kind or other once
aint that right hero
there are some disrespectful suggestions from the pickers concerning what his heroism might have been
and this here sensitive lookin fella is muddy
the less said about muddy the better
aint that right muddy
muddy scowls at homer but he smiles at mr
homer unpacks his suitcase
his bed should be nearest muddys and mr
jack lies on his bed smoking
muddy also smoking is sitting on his bed sharpening a knife
hero and peaches are playing cards on one of their beds
rose is finishing shaving
rose rose watches homer unpack
its just my heart
what you got a picture of your heart for
he holds up the x ray in order to show her
theres a little something wrong with it
just this part here the right ventricle
its slightly enlarged
yes so what
its nothing serious really
just a small defect
its big enough to keep you out of the war i suppose
aint that right
rose rose picks up the book that homer has put on the bed
she studies the cover its great expectations by charles dickens
she puts it down restlessly
they told me i was too old to serve
they told muddy his feet was too flat
everybody laughs except muddy
to peaches and you was generally unfit as i recall
finished unpacking homer sits on his bed he picks up great expectations and begins to read
rose rose sits down next to him watching him read
homer notices her interest
do you like to read
embarrassed i cant read
nobody taught me
homer smiles politely and goes back to his book
rose rose keeps looking over his shoulder at the pages
pointing to the page what does it say there
homer looks around at the pickers lying in their beds smoking listening
like bedtime stories at the orphanage he thinks however the pickers attitude is suspicious reserved
reading i looked at the stars and considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face to them as he froze to death and see no
help or pity in all the glittering multitude
homer looks up theres no response
to rose rose more
some muttering some giggling mostly silence
rose rose wants more but suddenly jack jumps out of bed and stomps to the kitchen end of the cider house where a piece of paper is tacked to the
jack is talking to homer all the way
since youre the one whos smart enough to read
jack points at the piece of paper
homer gets up and looks at it
its a list of rules it seems
all the men groan jack swears and peaches laughs
theyre for us i suppose
go on and read em homer
please dont smoke in bed
its too late for that one
all the smokers laugh and cough in their beds
uncharacteristically blunt stop it homer
they arent our rules
we didnt write them
i dont see no reason to read them
rose rose stomps back to her bed
her father absently snaps his towel
everybody is asleep except homer
he is staring at the ceiling in the quiet semi darkness the book lying on his chest
distant echoing good night you princes of maine
you kings of new england
larch is standing in the doorway to the boys room he closes the door
homer on his bed closes his eyes
larch lies in bed with his eyes open
the cider house and the apple orchard in the moonlight
wally in his farm clothes at the wheel of the jeep he is racing through the orchards dodging trees with homer in the passenger seat hanging on for dear life
in the morning when the tall grass is wet you can make the jeep slide on the grass
can you feel it
homer is excited as wally weaves among the trees faster and faster
its almost like flying
what about the trees
the trees are flak antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground
wally brakes hard
the jeep comes to a stop in the packing house area
candy has been waiting on the loading platform
the pickers are working in the background
defensively to candy i was just showing homer the orchards
kind of a geography lesson
good naturedly i know what youve been doing
she pulls an apple branch with an apple to two out of the vehicles grille or else the branch is wedged in the front bumper or headlight area
candy playfully starts poking wally with the branch
to wally youve been giving him a flying lesson
teasing her he loved it
to homer didnt you
yeah it was great
wally gets the apple branch away from candy
he pins her arms at her sides he hugs her kisses her
she doesnt struggle
laughing to homer he thinks people like to get whacked by branches
homer liked it
to homer didnt you
theres no stress or strain around here
they all laugh
homer observes the happy couple
homer is walking with wally and candy
the orchards are beautiful
much activity the pickers are unloading apple crates from a full flatbed trailer
an angry looking vernon gives homer an evil glare
homer spills some apples lifting the crate to the loading platform
whats wrong with you
rose takes homer aside
you best stay away from him until he gets to know you better then you best stay away from him more
wally in full uniform appears from inside the packing house he calls for homer
out lieutenants calling you homer
mind your ass
homer smiles are runs toward wally
homer and wally walk through the packing house where the hefty loud women sort through the apples rolling by on the conveyor tracks
wally snatches an apple from one of them giving it to homer
to homer you getting along okay
before homer can answer the women interrupt
where is that candy
did she leave you wally
whos the boy
wally makes an effort to introduce homer but hes interrupted
wally you can marry debra if candy leaves you
wallys gonna marry me if candy leaves him
you can marry all three of us wally
we can take turns
wally puts his hand to his heart
you girls make it hard for a guy to go off to war
points to homer but ill leave my best man here to pinch hit for me
as the women are left behind giggling wally continues talking to homer
im shipping out sooner than i thought
i just wanted to be sure you were settled in and happy enough considering
grabbing another apple from a crate are you bored stiff
or can you stick it out for a bit
actually picking apples is as much excitement as i want for a while
im grateful for the job
his hand on homers shoulder youre the one whos helping me homer
youre going to give my mom a little peace of mind while im gone
thats good then
awkward pause all i mean is im lucky i met you
i dont think so homer
im the lucky one
homer shakes his head
wally stops walking they both stop
more serious you want to fight about it
homer is unfamiliar with this kind of kidding around at first he is startled but then he laughs
wally laughs too
they shake hands
rose calls out to homer from the tractor
the pickers are impatiently waiting for him on the flatbed theyre going back to the orchard
homer has to run to catch up to them
he jumps on the flatbed he sees wally waving good bye
high up in a tall tree on a couple of ladders mr
rose and homer are picking side by side
rose is picking with high speed perfection but homer is slower and fumbling he drops an occasional apple to the ground
you pickin more cider apples then anythin else
them drops is good only for cider
and you pickin the stems with the apples only half the time
they good only for cider too if you dont pick them stems
homer watches him the rule is you wanna pick the apple with the stem homer
and see here
see that bud thats just above the stem
thats the bud for next years apple thats called the spur
you pick the spur you pickin two years in one you pickin next years apple fore it have a chance to grow
you leave that on the branch you hear
homer nods he picks more carefully with more concentration
approvingly thats better
i can tell you got yourself some education
thems good hands you got homer
them hands you got they know what theyre doin aint that right
i guess so
homer can see over the apple mart parking lot from the top of the tree
he can see the driveway of the worthington house where candy and olive are saying a tearful good bye to wally
distracted homer drops another couple of apples which mr
rose observes with a wry smile
larch is doing something at his desk when angela comes in
wilbur you should read this
larch stares at angela who holds a letter
its from the board
larch stands in front of a mechanical drawing easel
he works intently with a calligraphic pen but we dont see what hes working on
angela and edna sit at the desk theyre looking over the letter
quoting the letter uh
merely suggesting that some new blood might benefit you all
someone with new ideas in the obstetrical and pediatric fields
she looks up at larch i think theyre just testing some ideas for our next meeting
holtz seems nice
i think he only wants to help
he is a goddamn psychiatrist of course he wants to help
hed be happy if he could help commit me
its that mrs
goodhall you have to be careful of wilbur
one has to be more than careful of mrs
goodhall she has sufficient christian zeal to start her own country
id like to give her a little ether
so what are you going to do
larch puts down the pen comes around the easel opens a drawer in a filing cabinet and hands edna a folder containing a few cleanly typed pages
larch returns to the easel to his painstaking work
edna opens the file as she and angela read the contents larch recites from memory as he works
homer wells born portland maine march
homer was born here in what was it
graduated bowdoin college and harvard school of medicine
this is your life story wilbur
you just changed the dates
an internship and two years of training at the boston lying in south end branch
for his age he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon he is also experienced in pediatric care
you invented him
youve completely made his up
dont you understand
the board is going to replace me
thats what the new blood is for
you mean theyll replace you with someone who wont perform abortions
sarcastically well we can only guess about that edna
they are against the law
these credentials are against the law
we all know who trained homer his credentials are as good as mine are
dont you be holy to me about the law
what has the law done for any of us here
edna and angela think this over
points at file so here is my candidate
what do you think
but what about school records
homer doesnt have any diplomas
larch turns the easel around
attached is a parchment headed harvard medical school its a diploma in progress
he will have them edna
the women are shocked awed
oh wilbur i dont know
sudden thought we dont even know where he is
wheres that homer
homer stands in front of a ladder that leans against the cider house he starts to climb up drawn by the murmuring voices the soft laughter
hes a good boy
we dont know what he is
jack you gotta watch your language round my daughter
homer arrives at the top and sees everyone sitting on a long plank a bench attached to the apex of the roof obviously a popular spot
here he is
no one moves
wheres your manners
make room for homer sos he can enjoy the view
peaches slides over and homer sits down
are we supposed to be up here
the rules said
homer you the only one whos read them rules so you the only one who feels like hes doin somethin wrong
the others laugh
well muddy we can look at all these angry stars homers been readin to us about
more laughter homer smiles enjoying the teasing
gesturing toward the worthington farmhouse i bet the view looks better from the worthintons
you think so jack
i wouldnt want to be in that wallys shoes tonight
playfully teasing him daddy id like to be in that wallys shoes every night
teasing her back you lucky you in your work boots tonight girl
whats lucky about that
rose rose is being physically affectionate with her father lightly punching his arm rubbing the top of his head
you know where that wally is tonight darlin
hes up there in them angry stars
gesturing at the dark sky hes flyin all around up there
with them japs shooting at him
they all look up imagining that
homer more than the others
rose rose looking thoughtful rests her head on her fathers shoulder
they are completely natural together
homer and the pickers are loading crates of apples into a shipping truck
olive and candy are consulting some papers the shipping tally on a clipboard mr
rose is standing beside them
they all on board mrs
thank you arthur
see is looking at homer and how is our homer working out
she catches homers eye he smiles then joins them
rose puts his arm around him
oh hes a smart young man most of the time wally was right about him
olive is looking over the rest of the picking crew
no rotten apples
its an old way of speaking that they have no no not this year
maybe we got one but it aint homer
he means jack who gives olive and candy and mr
rose a furtive look
olive smiles at rose rose who comes up to her and candy
olive touches rose rose with affection
dear girl im sure i can find you some other clothes
to candy you must have some things that would fit her
candy takes rose rose by the shoulders and turns her around
rose rose is enjoying this
i have a ton of things that would fit you
now now candy this girl dont need no more clothes not for pickin
he starts leading his daughter away
charming arthur theres no such thing as a young woman whos got all the clothes she needs
olive waves good bye as she moves toward her car
candy turns to homer
not bored yet
im never bored
its all very
different for me
homer has the hardest time looking at candy
have you been feeling okay
when im not thinking about wally
im not good at being alone
realizing oh goodness
yes im fine
struggling to change the subject i dont suppose youve seen a lobster yet
homer shakes his head
he looks at the tractor and the empty trailer
rose and the pickers are just watching them
more seriously you have to come to my dads lobster pound and see one then
homer looks toward the pickers sitting on the flatbed when he hears the tractor start
candy follows his gaze
i better go
i dont think mr
rose would leave without you
rose gestures for muddy to drive off the tractor trailer pulls away
homer has to run to catch up
calling come next week
he jumps on the back of the departing flatbed between mr
rose and rose rose as candy watches him
an anxious looking white plumber is fixing the kitchen sink while the pickers in their towels stand around and watch
homer is putting on his best shirt
peaches admires the shirt as rose rose cooks the nights supper on the wood stove
whoa look at that homer
hes gettin all dressed up for supper tonight
he aint gettin dressed to have supper with us peaches
the pickers all look at homer who looks guilty as he leaves
to the plumber dont let us make you nervous or nothin we know you gotta job to do
yeah we can wait all night for the water to come back on you just go on and take your time
homer pedals a bicycle down a dirt road
ray holds a lobster up to the camera
we see the old fashioned wooden pens floating dockside
homer looks uncertain
homer and ray and candy go up the gangplank from the dock to the lobster pound
theyre the garbage eaters of the oceans floor
the seagulls clean up the shore
the lobsters clean up the bottom of the sea
they eat everything
everything that falls to the bottom
its time somebody ate them
to candy i was lookin for wallys letter
i was gonna show it to homer
to homer they made him a captain already captain worthington
daddy its a letter to me
he mentions homer too you know
awkwardly wally said to say hello
equally awkward oh
to homer wally said the most spectacular hits were in the oil fields at yenangyat
later through the window of the lobster pound we see them eating lobster around a kitchen table
laughter and some unclear dialogue drift to us
with the bicycle stowed in the trunk candy is driving homer back to the cider house
they pass a drive in movie theatre the marquee announcing closed for the season
homer stares in awe at the giant blank screen
a movie outside
but its closed all the time now because of the blackout
people watched the movies in their cars
smiling when they watched at all
do you like movies
ive only seen one though
candy looks at him he isnt joking
youve seen only one movie
its really good
i havent seen king kong since i was a kid
homer laughs a little self consciously around her he feels like hes still a kid
at one table the children are happily eating apples a few of the kids are stuffing apples from a big bowl into their pockets
at another table larch edna and angela sit around an open packing crate of apples
larch takes a bite from an apple and spits it out
angela takes the apple out of his hand
thats a pie apple wilbur
homer said youre not supposed to eat it
angela hands him another apple
so hes an apple expert is he
angela gives him a critical look as larch takes a bite out of the new apple
sarcastically oh my yes
this is a far superior taste and crisp too
you know so many apples are disappointingly mealy
i wonder of most of the apples in my life werent meant for pies
wilbur he picked them for us himself
incredulous you dont find it depressing that homer wells is picking apples
both edna and angela glower at him
or that he cant be bothered to write us a proper letter
a dissertation on apples we dont need
annoyed he probably doesnt make much money picking apples he must have had to pay to send them too
i wouldnt worry edna that he doesnt have money
if he gets hungry he can pick his dinner
larch angrily tosses the half eaten apple into the garbage
wilbur its a gift
how can you be angry with homer for sending us a gift
larch stares into space depressed
then he examines the crate and finds the mailing label that says ocean view orchards cape kenneth maine
he rips it off holds it up triumphantly
ill show him a gift
ill give him a gift he can use
larch storms out of the room
a newsreel from the war is playing on the screen soldiers marching smiling waving to the camera
homer and candy sit together watching
homer is completely fascinated candy watches homer as much as the news
her expression changes when the newsreel cuts to footage from an air raid
candy and homer walk out of the theatre under the marquee and past the poster for wuthering heights
disappointed but you looked as if you liked it
smiling i did like it
all i said was its not king kong
candy makes a face but in good fun
first she loved him then she didnt then no one else could have him
she did love him
teasing him how many women have you known
homer is embarrassed he ducks the question
and what did she die of exactly
she was torn apart
she died of a broken heart
homer smiles and shakes his head candy starts to laugh
whats the medical explanation
well she was in a weakened condition
laughs i dont know
what about king kong
is that medically possible
homer smiles he knows shes teasing him and he likes it
mock serious at least king kong knew what he wanted
candy pushes him playfully
theyre both having a good time too good a time
homer is picking apples in a big tree rose rose is on a ladder in the tree right beside him
shes picking about twice as fast as he is and he keeps dropping his apples
in another tree muddy is watching
what is you doin with that candy homer
rose hes makin history i suppose
from the surrounding trees the other pickers laugh
you aint gettin in no trouble i hope
in adjacent trees both peaches and hero are picking apples they can hear homer and rose rose too
so can mr
that candy shes the nicest girl i know
shes about the most beautiful girl i ever seen i dont know if shes the nicest
shes the nicest and the most beautiful girl ive ever known
the men oooh and aaah at homers announcement mr
that sounds like you is in trouble already homer
thats right that sounds like trouble to me
im not in trouble
yeah you is
i know when people is in trouble and you is
camera closes on homers face he keeps picking
his name is homer wells
edna and angela face the board of trustees around a table
larch circles the table as everyone reads the contents of a folder
larch has provided a copy for each member
the three elderly gentlemen on the board dont speak they just nod their heads to everything dr
holtz or mrs
and his pathetic resume is the best ive seen
though i find it hard to believe the board would be interested in this character
but he looks like an excellent young man a first rate candidate
he looks like a bleeding heart missionary moron to me but thats going to be the problem with any doctor interested in coming here
do you know him
i dont want to know him
hes doing missionary work in india
i wrote him weeks ago but hes either too holy or too busy to answer
maybe he got killed in the war
suddenly steerforth bursts through the door having been pushed from behind by mary agnes
the two stop when they see whats going on not to mention larchs stern expression
they back out
mary agnes winking at dr
holtz before the door closes
goodhall is ready to continue
i fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed that part of the world requires precisely the kind
of dedication that is needed here
does it snow in bombay
one winter here and well be shipping him south in a coffin
you cant think that a man who has served under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little snow have you no idea
how harsh and primitive and full of disease that part of the world is
then i suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him
larch he seems exceptionally qualified
im not talking about his medical qualifications
its the christian thing that bothers me i just dont see it being of much use around here
bitterly i fail to see how a little christianity could hurt anyone here
anyway i was just showing you this guy as an example of whats available i didnt think youd be interested
were very interested
you wouldnt be opposed to meeting with him
i suppose it wouldnt hurt to meet him
whats his name again
mumbling i just hope he wont expect us to say grace all the time
the three elderly gentlemen repeat the name
its a nice name very new england
very maine a very local sounding name
a song plays on the old phonograph as a happy larch and angela dance
edna interrupts them
i just wanted to ask you
come dance with me
lets be foolish tonight
does he know hes supposed to be in india
does he even want to come back
this causes larch to take the needle off the record
angrily hes a field hand
what could possibly hold him there
the rain beats down on olives car
homer gets soaking wet as he leans in to talk to candy whos behind the wheel
rose calls to homer from the doorway of the mill room
rose is instructing homer as they stand bottling cider in their yellow slickers and rubber boots
rose rose is hosing down the pressboards muddy and hero and peaches are operating the grinder and the press
jack is stirring the vat
in a defiant contemptuous way jack keeps flicking the ash of his cigarette into the vat
this make everyone uncomfortable only mr
rose doesnt appear to notice
cider dont have no taste till later in october its too watery now when were usin just them early macs and them gravensteins
you dont get no good cider till youre pickin them golden delicious and them winter bananas them baldwins and them russerts
what about the worms
most of these apples are the drops off the ground right
there have to be worms
of course theres worms homer
and what is them worms really
they just protein them worms
they is good for you
everyone but jack laughs
he takes a last drag on his cigarette then deliberately drops it into the vat
that just aint right jack your cigarettes gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider
that aint right
them people drinkin that cider they dont know theres a cigarette in there
its not that hard to find it in there jack itll take you just a minute
you just gotta go fishin
you mean swimmin
i aint goin in that vat to fish out no cigarette
what business is you in jack
just tell me what your business is
jack looks for a translation from the other men who are nervous
just say youre in the apple business man
thats the only business you wanna be in
just say it
jack pulls a knife on mr
whispers excitedly to jack you dont wanna go in the knife business with mistuh rose just say youre in the apple business jack
rose what business are you in
we never see mr
we see the men circle each other jack takes a swipe at mr
roses head then he steps back his yellow slicker slashed open
his slicker is opened up right up the middle
his shirt underneath the slicker is slashed open too he feels his bare chest and stomach feeling for the cut
but theres no cut jacks not bleeding hes not even scratched
just his clothes have been slashed
im in the knife business jack
you dont wanna go in the knife business with me
muddy turns jack around and views his slashed clothes
youre lucky he didnt cut your nipples off man
the good news jack is youre half undressed for swimmin
yeah that cigarette aint hard to find when youre properly undressed
jack starts to undress for the vat
rose ushers homer and rose rose outside
rose has cut his own hand in the fight
homers professionalism if offended to watch rose roses amateurish efforts to stitch up her fathers wound but clearly this isnt the first time shes done it
give men that
i know how to do it
oh i suppose you is a doctor homer
i dont need no almost a doctor homer
homer cant bear to watch rose rose at work with the needle
we should drown that damn jack in the vat
now now darlin
jack just needs to know what business hes in
yeah you really showed him daddy you just about cut your own hand off and all you cut off him was his clothes
you oughta know you dont go to jail for cuttin a guys clothes
aint that right homer
homer winces at the stitching
wallys car comes bouncing along the ditches of the closed drive in
homer is at the wheel candy calls out some driving instructions
the car comes to a stop next to a speakerpost
candy leans out she grabs the speaker and hangs it on the window
homer sits back and drapes his arms out the window and over the seat
he feels great
youre a natural
you were born to drive a car like this
maybe i was
looks around i love this place
homer looks up at the giant movie screen
the screen is enormous
imagine king kong up there
have you seen a lot of movies here
when you come here you dont really care about the movie
homer stares at candy in disbelief
you dont care about the movie
candy looks at him for a moment
what are you so crazy about the movies for
it was my favorite night at the orphanage movie night
wed race into the dining hall
of course everyone wanted to sit in front so wed be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing
at least you were never lonely
i didnt say that
growing up in an orphanage youre always lonely
youre just never alone
candy is moved
homer feels exposed he tries to change the mood by making light of what hes said
youre not alone in the bathroom or
or in the shower
youre never alone in wanting the last piece of meatloaaf or even in your own bed on a cold morning
you dont miss it
i miss things
with certainty i miss reading to the boys
but you had so much responsibility
i never asked for any responsibility
just a little privacy
privacy is exactly the point of drive in movies
did you come here with wally to not watch movies
at the mention of wally they both look a little self conscious
movies mostly bore wally
points to the speaker so what is that a radio
for the movie sound
candy looks at homer
scrunch down like this
candy scrunches down in her seat homer imitates her
homer is focused on the giant screen
how could you not care about the movie
you just cuddle
you come to hug
you dont come here to watch the movie
teasing her thats what id come here for
id watch the movie
not with the right girl you wouldnt
homers expression changes from exhilarated to guilty
he leans back in his seat and looks straight ahead at the screen
candy tentatively leans her head on his shoulder
homer looks afraid to breathe
from behind with her head on his shoulder they look like a normal couple
we track in toward the huge screen until we see only the screen
there are shadows on the black screen
suddenly the movie king kong appears
king kong is playing against the bare white wall
fuzzy is very weak but he smiles at the sight of the love struck kong holding the screaming fay wray in his giant hand
larch runs the projector he sits close beside fuzzy
when the film breaks in the predictable place fuzzy makes no protest
larch looks at fuzzy who has stopped breathing his eyes are closed
they are alone in the dining hall
larch has wheeled in fuzzy for a private viewing
buster helps larch lower the small coffin into the grave
the tiny gravestone says f
what are you going to tell the little ones
ill tell them fuzzy was adopted
why would the little ones believe that anyone would adopt him
theyll believe it because they want to believe it
shouldnt we tell homer
if homer wanted to know what was happening here he could pick up a telephone and call us
the boys in their beds listen to buster inventing fuzzys family
it was a family with a better breathing machine then the one dr
larch leans against the wall covering his eyes overhearing the boys
the family that adopted fuzzy they invented the breathing machine
its their business
larch pauses he waits to see if they believe this
larch almost breaks with a sudden sharp breath
good night fuzzy
good night fuzzy
good night fuzzy stone
as the men sit at the picnic table eating their cornbread rose rose pours coffee
a jeep comes down the orchard road toward them
rose leads the good mornin mrs
olive has an armful of clothing and a fairly sizable package she brings the latter over to homer
some mail for you homer
homer shakes the package he puts the package beside the table unopened
olive turns to rose rose
and some clothes for you dear nodding to the cider house lets go see if they fit
rose watches rose rose and olive disappear into the cider house
the other men view homers package with curiosity especially peaches
aint you gonna see what it is homer
mind your own business peaches
homer lies awake in bed everyone else is asleep
homer pulls the package out from under his bed opening it just enough to see what it is then he shoves it back under his bed
the beach at sunset
candy and homer dressed for cooler weather are alone at the waters edge
from a paper bag candy is scattering some small brightly colored pieces of broken glass
arent you worried that people will cut their feet
nobody will swim here until next summer
by then the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand there wont be any sharp edges
she finds and old piece of glass among the stones and shells at the high tide mark
thats last years glass or from some year before
i put glass here every year
the ocean makes it beautiful
candy holds up a piece of glass to the sun for homer to look at
the ocean is a gray green color the glass a paler shade of green
give me your hand
she rubs the smooth piece of glass against his hand then throws it toward the water
it falls short
homer retrieves it
candy splashes him playfully
he chases her away from the beach into the pine trees
homer locks his arms around her from behind
he cant let go
she lets him hold her then breaks his grip
she turns to face him
she is taller then he is older obviously more experienced
she initiates the kiss
they drop to the ground right there they make love by the roots of the tree candy guiding him
they come out of the woods walking toward the car candy leading
we hear candy talking just before we see her and homer
increasingly upset nobody volunteers for the burma run he said so himself
and nobody knows me better than him
so how am i supposed to feel
hes a bomber pilot and im just selfish i know
well im not a brave little girl and im not sorry
she sits in the passenger seat homer in the drivers seat
i know this was right
pause i told you
im not good at being alone
pause in a whisper i told him too
homer concentrates on starting the car
repeating herself i know this was right
their expressions as the car pulls away belie their words
homer and mr
rose sit opposite each other at the picnic table
rose rose stands behind her father her hands on his shoulders watching homer snip out mr
roses stitches very quickly
slow down homer dont be in such a big hurry
this is easy im not hurrying
you still doin it too fast
job done homer leaves the table and hurries to the bicycle pedaling away
rose rose watches homer go as mr
rose flexes his healed hand
hes in a big hurry all right
i told you hes in trouble
candy and homer sit on the dock
candy still seems to be wrestling with her conscience
homer throws snails in the sea
just tell me
do you want me to go
do you want me to stay
it will be okay
what will be okay
we have to wait and see
i think that for everything in life you have to wait and see
homer throws a snail with more force
ill just move on get another job somewhere
ray comes out onto the dock he sees homer throwing another snail
every time you throw a snail off the dock youre makin someone start his whole life over
candy throws a handful of snails into the water
maybe were doing the snails a favor daddy
ray looks at the two of them he sighs
its gettin late
i think ill pack it in
good night daddy
ray nods good night he leaves
homer looks expectantly at candy
well just have to wait and see
olive and homer sit at the dining room table the remnants of an apple pie in front of them
homer is still eating
pictures of wally are on the wall
i used to hate it when wally went back to college even when it was just college
and this was when his father was still alive
i hated it even then
naturally i hate this more
homer nods in sympathy
his mouth is stuffed with apple pie
what i mean is
i would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here homer
wiping his mouth mrs
worthington i feel im very lucky to be here
theres not a lot of work in the winter and youll have to tolerate vernon even wally despises him and wally likes everyone
olives thoughts drift her eyes look up at a photo of wally
i think wally will be fine mrs
worthington he seems indestructible to me
distracted i dont know
intently at homer just promise me one thing
homer is tense
does olive suspect about candy
just promise me that if theres a blizzard youll move into wallys room until its over
they both laugh but homer has a hard time looking her in the eye
the pickers are moving out the harvest is over
olive and homer stand near the door to the bunkhouse talking we cant hear their conversation
rose rose and the other men walk past them carrying the last of their belongings to the truck
olive and homer walk over to the truck
have a safe trip home
thank you again for all your hard work
you take care now mrs
they shake hands
good bye arthur
she hugs rose rose homer ill see you tomorrow
olive gets in her jeep and waves as she drives off
the truck is packed
muddy tugs on a rope that secures the load
rose we all set i think
rose nods and gets in behind the wheel
rose rose and muddy get in next to him
the others are bundled up for the ride in the open back of the truck
as theyre leaving homer waves good bye the pickers calling out to him
you all take care of yourself too homer
we see you next harvest
dont freeze to death homer
go on and freeze to death if you want to homer
now now jack that just aint right
you just stay out of trouble homer
homer stands looking after them after theyre gone
homer is alone rearranging his stuff spreading out a bit making the place his own
on the other beds we see the mattresses rolled up on the bare bedsprings
so youre staying
homer turns he hadnt seen candy come in
olive told me
awkward pause you might have told me yourself
im just waiting and seeing
like you said
he goes to her they embrace
homer drinking coffee is writing a letter on a note pad
larch thank you for your doctors bag
homer is learning how to haul a lobster pot with ray and candys guidance
although it seems that i will not have the occasion to use it
following rays example homer is trying to disarm the lobsters big claws by blocking them shut with the little wooden wedges
roy works quickly never getting pinched
as candy watches homer gets pinched
barring some emergency of course
i am not a doctor
with all due respect to your profession
i am enjoying my life here
homer and candy are naked
they have pulled two beds together and made a double bed
he cant take his eyes off her
ive looked at so many women
i mean ive seen everything about them everything
but i never felt a thing
i felt nothing
to look at you
edna and angela and larch are all reading homers letter their lips moving silently as they read the words
i am enjoying being a lobsterman and an orchardman in fact i have never enjoyed myself so much
olive and homer and candy are playing a board game around the fireplace
the truth is i want to stay here
i believe i am being of some use
edna and angela view him anxiously from the doorway as larch furiously types and types
my dear homer i thought you were over your adolescence that period which i would define as the first time in our lives when we imagine we have something terrible
to hide from those who love us
candy is singing to the car radio as animated and happy as weve ever seen her
homer driving can scarcely keep his eyes on the road he has to keep looking at her
do you think its not obvious to us whats happened to you
with the radio playing a popular song homer hops across the bare floor pulling on his boxer shorts he opens the door to olive whos holding out an armload of
blankets to him
he sheepishly thanks her
when homer closes the door we see a hidden and stricken candy naked from their interrupted lovemaking
youre fallen in love havent you
by the way whatever youre up to cant be too good for your heart
then again its the sort of condition that can be made worse by worrying about it
so dont worry about it
vernon and homer are working under an apple tree they are poisoning mice
larch what i am learning here may not be as important as what i learned from you but everything is new to me
yesterday i learned how to poison mice
you use poison oats and poison corn
supper chaos buster and mary agnes are doing their best to stop a food fight while larch and angela and edna are completely absorbed reading homers letter
field mice girdle an apple tree
pine mice kill the roots
i know what you have to do you have to play god
killing mice is as close as i want to come to playing god
homer and candy are watching rebecca
do i interfere
when absolutely helpless women tell me that they simply cant have an abortion that they simply must go through with having another and yet another orphan
do i interfere
i do not
i do not even recommend
i just give them what they want an orphan or an abortion
close on homer you are my work of art homer
everything else has been just a job
i dont know if youve got a work of art in you but i know what your job is
youre a doctor
the radio is playing a slow sexy dance number
the fat ladies from the apple mart are dancing as they paint the interior walls of the bunk house
i am not a doctor
you know everything i know plus what youve taught yourself youre a better doctor then i am and you know it
homer is finishing up painting the kitchen walls
when he gets to the list of rules tacked on the wall he removes the list and finishes painting under where the rules were
theyre going to replace me homer
the board of trustees is looking for my replacement
two of the ladies unroll the rolled up mattresses on the bare bedsprings as vernon enters with an armload of blankets and pillows
i cant replace you
homer holds up the list of rules rereads it briefly he walks over to an unpainted beam a support beam and tacks the rules on this beam
homer reads larchs letter sipping coffee
im not sorry
not for anything ive done
im not even sorry that i love you
larch sits on his ether bed with a letter from homer in his hand
he looks completely deflated
angela is standing in the doorway
i think we may have lot him to the world
hes not coming back
in the newly painted spruced up cider house homer and candy are dancing to another slow sexy song on the radio
he is untucking her blouse feeling under her blouse she starts to unbutton his shirt
they kiss while they dance
but the song changes abruptly on the radio to something fast and silly
homer responds to the music dancing goofily instantly out of the mood
candy laughs but she picks up a pillow and swings it at him hitting him
he dances away from her
she throws the pillow he ducks the pillow lands somewhere near the door
now homer grabs a pillow and chases her from bed to bed
she shrieks theyre both laughing
they each grab a pillow and stand toe to toe whacking each other laughing all the while until he pins her arms behind her and breathing hard and despite the
stupid music that broke the mood they are passionately kissing again
the sound of a truck is sudden and loud
roses truck has arrived
the pickers are hopping out of the truck grabbing their gear
the door opens
hero and peaches barge in as homer and candy are struggling to return the pillows to the beds
its that homer
muddy is right behind them
he picks up a pillow off the floor looking for which bed it belongs on
its that candy too
then comes mr
rose slyly smiling taking it all in theres no hiding whats going on
homer and candy are caught their shirts untucked and half unbuttoned theyre still out of breath
the pillows lie crazily on the beds each one of which has been stepped on
dont this place look like home
it look nicer then home
what have you two been doin to make it look so nice
rose rose enters
she looks hardened toughened not happy
she plops down her stuff on her bed looking only at candy
how is that wally doing
oh hes fine
i just heard from him
hes bombing all these places
homer tries to help out
mumbling bridges oil refineries fuel depots
he peters out knowing how sick of hearing this candy is
he tries to change the subject
there is an uncomfortable silence
he just wasnt up for the trip
that jack just never knew what his business was
one look at muddy and we know something pretty bad happened to jack
the pickers on their ladders all picking
homer is now a good picker he looks over at rose rose
she is slumped against the ladder not picking completely ignoring an argument beneath them in the aisle between the trees
rose is checking over the apples peaches has just picked
you pickin nothin but cider apples peaches i hope you understand that
they aint drops i picked em off the tree
then you pickin em too fast they aint no better than drops to me
see that bruise and that one
half of these is bruised
look at this one
it aint got no stem
you might as well step on em too they only good for cider
in the aisle between the trees homer and candy are arguing in one of the work vehicles
do you think im having a good time
do you think im just teasing you
do you think i know whether i want you or wally
so we should wait and see
for how long
i grew up with wally
i began my adult life with him
thats all there is to it then
thats not all there is to it
i love you too i know i do
okay okay i know you do too
bitterly its a good thing i didnt have that baby isnt it
her sudden hardness leaves him speechless as they go their separate ways
candy drives on
breakfast time at the picnic table
rose rose by herself away from the table
she does not look well she suddenly goes back inside the bunkhouse
calling after her aint you eatin with us rose
to the men she used to eat with us
now we aint good enough for her i guess
she aint hungry maybe
she aint hungry every mornin cause shes sick every mornin
homer gets up to take his dishes inside
when homer comes in rose rose is throwing up in the sink
you okay rose
i guess you must like watchin me be sick
i dont like watching anyone be sick
rose rose lies down on her bed with the curtain open
there is something familiar about the way homer approaches her bedside he does so with the authority of a doctor
he sits on the edge of her bed with such complete self assurance that she doesnt protest
how many months are you
she just stares
but she doesnt stop him when he touches her abdomen
its as if she knows that he knows what hes doing
youre not yet three months are you
what do you know about it
i know more than i want to know about it
whos the father
dont trouble yourself about it homer this aint your business
but you dont look very happy
what are you thinkin
how am i supposed to take care of a baby
i cant have a baby
rose please listen
whatever you want to do i can help you
she is taken back
what i mean is if you dont want to
keep the baby i know a place where you can go
you think daddys gonna let me go anywhere
i aint going nowhere
she rolls over on the bed facing away from him again
why dont you just go back to your pickin homer
i can take care of it myself
rose listen dont do anything
you know i mean to yourself
is this a workin day or what
homer and candy are sitting at the dock
we should take her to st
that much is obvious isnt it
let her make up her mind when she gets there
i told her
she doesnt feel she can do that
something about her father not letting her go anywhere
well we have to help her
homer doesnt respond
we have to do something
homer looks out over the ocean he remains unresponsive
rose rose is setting the picnic table for lunch when candy arrives
she keeps setting the table
ive got some more clothes for you i just keep forgetting to bring them with me
i dont need no more clothes thank you
softly rose i know whats going on
homer told me
i got pregnant too about a year ago
pause ive been through this
rose rose looks down
you aint been through what i been through candy
doesnt get it yes i have
rose rose dismissively waves her hand
whos the father rose
rose looks at candy and shakes her head
you want to have the baby
rose rose shakes her head again more emphatically
i know where you can go
homer and i can take you
i cant go nowhere
rose rose stays silent
is it the father
does he know
rose rose turns away from candy
you can trust me
is it jack
its not jack is it
is it muddy
almost wistfully no
it aint muddy
rose rose stops she cant even continue setting the table
her voice turns bitter despairing
it sure aint jack
there suddenly is mr
rose walking past them
he is uncharacteristically tentative
to his daughter ill be up top
rose leaves candy and rose rose alone again
rose rose nods almost invisibly after her father
rose rose looks pointedly at candy nodding
candy slowly gets it
rose is the father
rose rose lets that sink in she keeps looking at candy with an ashamed expression
the pickers are at work on their ladders when candy runs down the aisle between two rows of trees
she stops at the bottom of homers ladder out of breath
muddy and peaches and hero in the treetops are watching and listening
she wont go to st
shrugging well we cant force her
its her decision
you dont understand
its her father
shouting hes the father
hes her babys father
the pickers cant help but hear this too
candy starts to leave homer running after her
are you sure
weve got to keep her away from that bastard
homer starts looking for mr
smiling his enigmatic smile mr
rose keeps slowly picking while homer stands at the foot of his ladder
i didnt see where you was pickin this mornin homer but you musta worked up a big appetite
you look like youre serious about gettin to your lunch today
is it true
rose stops picking his eyes darting to see whos around
are you sleeping with your own daughter
rose with deliberate slowness comes down the ladder
slyly still composed i think you been stayin up too late at night homer
youre actually having sex with your own little girl
is that possible
aint nobody havin sex with my little girl homer thats somethin a father knows
how can you
with your own daughter
rose switches from sly to threatening in a split second
homer dont you know what business you in
you dont wanna go into no business with me homer aint that right
go on cut my clothes
ive got other clothes
rose is indignant
you a fine one to be talkin about lies
these people took you in
that boy wallys at war
that takes some of the steam out of homers superiority
but shes your daughter
and i love her
there aint nobody else gonna treat her as good as i do
looks away i wouldnt do nothin to hurt her homer you must know that
homer turns he speaks over his shoulder as he walks away
do you know that
by his expression he looks as if hes been punched its clear that mr
rose didnt know that
the other pickers are on their way to lunch its obvious that muddy peaches and hero already know that mr
rose is sleeping with his daughter
rose rose is sitting at the picnic table when the pickers arrive for lunch almost simultaneously with homer
he looks at then looks away from rose rose
rose is the last to sit down at the table as a very tense wordless lunch begins
homer is on a ladder picking apples
muddy climbs a ladder on the other side of the same tree
dont mess in this homer if you know whats good for you
how longs this been going on muddy
you aint gonna stop it
muddy looks all around for mr
rose then he gives homer his knife
theres my knife homer
it aint gonna do me no good
you give that knife to rose rose you hear
homer nods pocketing the knife
as muddy climbs down and moves his ladder to an adjacent tree he keeps talking to homer until he disappears in the leaves
you best just watch you ass homer
you dont wanna end up like jack
homer thoughtfully continues his work
homer lies awake in his bed
the pickers on their ladders in the trees nobody is talking
in the late sun the leaves have a reddish fiery glow
its much colder the pickers are on their ladders in the trees again but theyre dressed for the cold
homer is high on a ladder he turns toward the view of the worthington house when he hears a car come to a screeching halt in the driveway
homer sees candy get out of wallys car she leaves the door open and runs toward the house
parked in front of wallys car is an army jeep with an enlisted man leaning against it
the indifferent soldier smokes a cigarette as he watches candy run
homer descends the ladder and runs for the house down as aisle between the row of trees
the pickers watch him run
camera follows homer into the worthington house where from the front hall he sees olive and candy in profile sitting on the couch
we cant see whos talking nor do we recognize the voice
as homer comes into the living room we see major winslow sitting in a chair also in profile talking to olive and candy
major winslow is a smooth handsome well briefed officer in the casualty branch of the army air corps hes done his homework but hes not all business
hes painfully aware of the delicate nature of his report
when the plane was hit the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together
the copilot jumped third
all on captain worthingtons orders the captain was still flying the plane
none of the men of the ground could see the sky thats how thick the jungle was
they never saw the plane crash they never heard it crash
they never saw captain worthingtons parachute either
why was he missing for twenty days
because the crew thought hed gone down with the plane
they were hospitalized for almost a week in china before they were flown back to india
it wasnt until that they sorted through their gear
who cares about their gear
three men jumped from the plane but they had four compasses with them
one of the crew jumped with captain worthingtons compass
he was in burma for twenty days without a compass
he followed the irrawaddy river all the way to rangoon
somehow he managed to avoid the japs but not the mosquitoes
then its malaria
its encephalitis b
hes recovering at mount lavinia hospital ceylon
captain worthington is paralyzed
olive gasps waist down
he wont walk
candy stands and leaves the room
to olive im sorry
asks the major there are no autonomic effects are there
major winslow has to consult his notes
no autonomic effects
when will he be home major
four weeks or so right around halloween
homer and candy are sitting in the parked car in silence
finally there are no autonomic effects just the paralysis of the lower extremities
candy stares at him uncomprehending
wally can have kids a normal sex life
ray is throwing snails in the water
candy sits on the end of the dock slumped on homers shoulder
how about him not needin the friggin compass
how about that
ray knows that she wants him to leave
he shuffles off the dock toward the house
he knows how they both must feel
good night kids
dont catch cold its gettin cold already
good night daddy
good night ray
homer tries to cuddle closer but candy sits up preoccupied
just tell me
ill do whatever you want to do
isnt that like waiting and seeing
nothing is nothing
i want wally to come home
im afraid to see him too
he kisses her is that nothing
no dont thats something
nothing is nothing
homers sad smile dont even look at me
candy buries her face in his chest
to do nothing
homer holds her doing nothing while she sobs
as her crying subsides homers thoughts are far away
with candy slumped against him hugging him he doesnt look at her instead he looks out to sea and at the darkening coast candys words resonating
an unfamiliar expression is on his face
mumbling to himself its a tempting idea i know
to do nothing
candy is silent
homer feels strangely agitated he shifts his position
groans please dont move dont go anywhere
overly genuine go anywhere
of course not
that would be doing something wouldnt it
we wouldnt want to do something
lets just sit here all night
irritated if youre trying to be funny homer
irritated too im not trying to be anything im just doing nothing
if i wait and see long enough then with any luck i wont ever have to make up my mind
decisions can be painful after all
candy is angry she gets to her feet and stares hard at him
just cut it out
mock surprise you got up
you did something
if you keep this up you might be in danger of making a decision
for gods sake homer wallys been shot down
homer puts his face in his hands for a minute
he regains his composure and stands up
genuinely contrite i know im sorry
yelling and sobbing hes paralyzed
deadpan just the facts hes alive
he still loves you
pause so do i
anguished what do you want me to do
he faces away from her
with calm resolve nothing
youre not the one who has to do anything
homer is in semidarkness as he walks toward the cider house
where do you think youre going
you gotta let me go daddy
homer walks faster
when he gets to the cider house he sees mr
rose and rose rose arguing
rose is sitting on the bicycle a bundle of her clothes tied up behind the seat
you aint goin nowhere in the middle of the night girl
i aint your business no more daddy
please let me go
rose rose starts to pedal away but mr
rose stops her
she starts to struggle
maybe i can help
they turn to see homer
you just go inside homer
we dont need no help
thats right homer
this aint your business
she tries to break free from her father and pedal away but he stops her again
they keep struggling
please listen to me
both of you
you forget yourself homer
this heres my daughter
you got your own mess to deal with aint that right
homer steps between them which makes mr
yelling what business is you in homer
rose im in the doctor business
to rose rose if you want i can help you
you dont have to go anywhere
rose rose and mr
rose stop struggling
suddenly homer is in charge
muddy hero and peaches smoke in their beds
rose rose opens her curtain and peers out from her bed
she gets up and goes toward the kitchen area in her nightshirt she stops at an unused bed now covered with white rubber sheeting homers medical instruments are displayed and
homer finished scrubbing his hands in the sink
his surgical mask is loosely tied around his neck
rose is looking at homers surgical instruments when rose rose joins him
to homer whats that
whats it called
one cervical stabilizer two sets of dilators douglas points
one medium sized curette one small one medium speculum one large two vulsellum forceps
there aint no almost about this stuff homer aint that right
homer ignores him he keeps naming his equipment
merthiolate ether vulval pads gauze lots of gauze
when it comes to this you is the real thing is that what you sayin
homer looks at mr
rose and rose rose
no almost about it im a doctor
homer turns to peaches hero and muddy
get out of here please
muddy herds peaches and hero out of the bunkhouse
im stayin homer
then you can be of use
rose wears a surgical mask he is sweating even in the cold and his eyes look stricken as he watches homer who is performing the abortion
rose holds the ether cone over rose roses face
he drips some ether from the bottle on the cone
cut quickly for rose roses etherized face
roses eyes above his mask
to homer working with his eyes trained on the speculum
to muddy and peaches and hero huddled under the overhanging roof in the rain
rose is having a hard time breathing
you better get some air
the cider house in the rain
rose staggers out he stands there in the rain trying to regain his composure
he starts to scream
another angle huddled under the overhanging roof muddy and peaches and hero are watching him
rose rose curled in a fetal position listens to the rain on the roof
candy sits on her bed beside her
she helps her to sit up to drink a glass of water then rose rose lies down again
rose roses expression never changes while candy talks to her
rose lies in his bed in the exact same fetal position as his daughter he too is listening to candy
homer is putting away his instruments
the bleeding should taper off tomorrow but it can come back again
the cramps will ease up almost entirely
the bleeding is usually much lighter in two days
as long as the bleeding isnt heavy its normal
muddy enters the cider house from out of the storm
he glances at candy and rose rose then at homer
then he speaks to mr
its that vernon he keeps askin where you and homer and rose rose is at
tell that vernon to mind his own business muddy
i told him that you all is sick
tell him what you want muddy you is the crew boss today
hero and peaches dripping wet come inside
peaches is standing next to the list of rules tacked to the kitchen support beam
look at that
them same damn rules is tacked up again
homer has finished putting his instruments away
why dont you put them damn rules in the wood stove peaches
as the men are murmuring their approval of this idea rose rose interjects
i want to hear what they are first
the men groan but mr
rose wont oppose his daughter on this subject not this time
he just lies there
homer let me hear what they are
homer begins to read
one please dont smoke in bed
we heard that one already homer
two please dont go up to the roof to eat your lunch
thats the best place to eat lunch
three please even if you are very hot do not go up to the roof to sleep
what do they think
they must think were crazy
they think were dumb niggers so we need dumb rules thats what they think
this is the last one
the men groan in mock disappointment
four there should be no going up on the roof at night
why dont they just say stay off the roof
yeah they dont want us up there at all
homer crumples the list and throws it into the wood stove
to homer thats it
it means nothin at all
and all this time i been wonderin about it
theyre outrageous them rules
who live here in this cider house peaches
who grind them apples who press that cider who clean up the mess and who just plain live here
just breathin in the vinegar
he pauses somebody who dont live here made them rules
them rules aint for us
we the ones who make up them rules
we makin our own rules every day
aint that right homer
camera closes on candy
homer and candy sit and stare at the blank screen they dont look at each other
candy grips the steering wheel of the parked car
please dont make me say it again
no thats not it i just want to be sure i understand you
candy slumps forward with her forehead on the steering wheel
i helped you not to think about wally
you were so upset you couldnt stand worrying about him about his being killed and not coming back but when you were with me you could stop worrying
well for a while anyway
this is how i helped you right
i loved you too you know i did
sarcastically and now that wallys coming back and because hell certainly need you
you say that as though its some awful thing
angrily i never stopped loving wally
homer lets that sink in
still sarcastic at least theres no more waiting and seeing
at least i got to see the ocean
candy covers her face in her hands and cries uncontrollably unstoppably
homers anger keeps him impervious to her tears another first for him
he turns and looks at her with an almost clinical curiosity then he goes back to staring at the blank screen
the rain has stopped but the grass is wet the trees glistening in the dawn light as wallys car stops and homer gets out
the car exits the frame in one direction homer walking exits the frame in another
as he walks toward the cider house homer sees muddy and peaches and hero waving to him from the roof
rose rose has runned away
she took off in the night
she took off on the bicycle man
homer starts jogging then running toward the cider house
muddy comes down the ladder to meet him
rose roses bed is exposed
the curtains are flung open her bed is empty
rose is still in his bed in the fetal position we have seen before
roses trancelike expression doesnt change as homer and muddy enter
aint nobody gonna find her homer shes long gone
pause i swear i didnt try and stop her i just wanna touch her hand before she go
thats all i wanna do i swear
pause whered she get that knife muddy
that looked like your knife what i seen of it
muddy is scared he looks to homer for advice
if that was your knife muddy i wanna thank you for givin it to her no girl should be goin hitch hikin if she dont got a good knife with
seeing the blood whered she get you
she just plan misunderstand me i was tryin to give her my knife i was just reachin to touch her hand
but i understand if she misunderstand me its all my fault aint that right
homer takes the blanket off him muddy gasps
homer tries to examine mr
rose smiles at him
its too late for the doctor now homer aint that right
homer doesnt answer he knows mr
rose is a goner
proudly shes good with that knife
shes real fast
shes a lot better with that knife than you is muddy
and who do you suppose taught her
you taught her i suppose
a girls gotta know how to defend herself dont she
he winces in pain at homers examination
surprised theres more than one laceration more than one cut
thats cause i sticked my own knife in the wound after she go i sticked my own knife in there
i poked it all around i just tryin to find the same place she got me
homer finds mr
theres blood everywhere
you listen to me you tell them police how this happen you tell it this way you hear
my daughter she runned off and i so sad about it that i stabbed myself
i so unhappy that she gone i killed myself that what you say you hear
that the true story aint that right
homer and muddy exchange a glance
rose with his blood soaked hand suddenly grabs homer by the throat
let me hear you say that
i so unhappy she runned away that i killed myself that what happen here aint that right
that what happen you lost you only daughter sos you killed yourself
thats what we say all right
i know you understand how i feel homer you is breakin them rules too
aint that right
muddy turns away
homer closes mr
muddy and hero and peaches are sitting close together on the roof like banished children
it is from their perspective that we see the police car and the ambulance two men carrying the body out of the cider house and a cop or two talking
to homer and olive and homer talking to them
we hear no dialogue
homer and the men load crates of apple jelly onto a truck
the mood is solemn they work with tired focus
candy drives up
the men are evasive with her they find a reason to work across the mart
candy walks to homer stands next to him
they say nothing for a moment until candy breaks the silence
do you think shell be all right
she knows how to take care of herself
candy looks away she cant think of what to say
she shoves her hands into her pockets finds a letter there which she hands to homer
this came for you a couple of days ago
olive asked me to bring it
with everything happening i guess she forgot
homer looks at the letter from st
clouds he puts it unopened in his pocket without a second thought
candy cant let things end there
i know you dont think much of being needed or of me for that matter
im sorry for what i said about wally needing you
no im the one who should be sorry
you have every right to be angry
you warned me
i didnt listen but you warned me
candy looks surprised
you told me you werent any good at being alone
pause you told wally too
candy can only stare straight ahead
relenting hes going to be fine wallys going to be fine
i know he is
a tear rolls down candys cheek homer wipes it away then he stops touching her and looks off into the quiet orchards
the pickers lie in their beds smoking
homer is undressing
he pulls the letter out of his pocket and sits down on his bed
homer opens the letter without enthusiasm and begins to read
dear homer i am writing to tell you about wilbur
music is playing on the old phonograph as an exhausted larch gives himself ether
edna is getting the girls ready for bed
music continues over
larch has twisted himself on the narrow bed so that his face is unusually close to the windowsill and when the ether cone starts to fall off his face and
his slack hand trails down off the side of the bed the cone becomes caught against the windowsill
he tries to turn his face away from the cone but he presses his face into the sill thus holding the ether soaked cone over his mouth and nose
his hands twitch hes trying to wake up the hand that holds the ether bottle lets the bottle fall
the bottle shatters against the sill the ether spreads running red with blood from a cut on dr
larchs hand or finger
music continues over
its a funeral
buster is bringing in the wood as the music plays over
buster smells the spilled ether
he heads toward the dispensary sniffing
camera follows him into the dispensary
in the dispensary buster approaches larchs ether bed
he drops the armload of wood and runs for help
she feels for larchs pulse larch is dead
angela opens a window
she pulls larchs body away from the windowsill
buster joins her on the bed
i can assure you that the overdose was entirely accidental
homer finishes reading the letter he puts it down gets up and walks to a window
he stares into the night
let us be happy for dr
larch has found a family
good night dr
good night dr
good night dr
homer wipes a tear off his cheek
the truck is packed for the long trip south it passes by the packing house which looks closed for the season
no one else is about
muddy is driving slowly his arm out the open window
in the back huddled among their belongings are peaches and hero on one side and homer on the other
the pickers are trying to draw homer into their conversation while homer is giving the apple farm a good bye look
he has made up his mind about something
you ever see a palm tree homer
he aint never been outta maine
aint you sick of pine trees homer
homer just smiles and shakes his head
as the pickers truck drives past homer is on the side of the truck nearest the worthington house and driveway he sees olive and candy and ray helping wally out
of the car and into a wheelchair
a nurse stands by
wally is wearing what appears to be an oversized officers coat or flight jacket his face looking small in the overlarge clothes
he cant move his legs at all and his mouth is drawn into a tight lipped smile
let me tell you somethin about florida homer
the sunshine state
its so nice n warm down there you can pick them grapefruits and oranges naked if you want to
olive is dissolved in tears
candy is sobbing she kisses wally without ceasing while he haltingly touches her face her hair
in the truck the smile is gone from homers face
he shakes his head
id like to go with you
but ive got to move on
you could move on with us man
you could move on somewhere warm
homer stayin in maine aint movin on
this makes all the pickers laugh but homer just smiles and shakes his head
he watches the worthington house disappear from view
a conductor taking tickets comes to homer who is better dressed than weve ever seen him he is looking at his sober reflection in the black window glass of the
night train when the conductor gets his attention
when the conductor moves on homer takes angelas letter out of his breast pocket he skips ahead to the end
larch often wondered how the world was treating you
he talked a lot about you hoping you would be of use whatever you were up to
angela and buster and mary agnes and edna carry larchs coffin they set it down by the raw hole
the pile of fresh dirt stands out against the new snow the hole is black against the new white
oh lord support us all the day long
we see the wheelbarrow with the gravestone
until the shadows lengthen and the evening comes and the busy world is hushed and the fever of life is over and our work is done
we see the faces of the girls praying for larch mary agnes too as edna finishes her favorite prayer
then in thy mercy grant us a safe lodging and a holy rest and peace at the last
camera closes on homer sleeping to the sound of the rocking train
angelas letter lies in his lap
the train stops blowing snow
homer steps off the train carrying a suitcase and dr
the disapproving stationmaster is still disapproving
music plays over something triumphant
homer makes his way up the hill toward the orphanage
edna is breaking up fights this time instead of fighting over snowballs the orphans are fighting over their pumpkins
suddenly homer tops the brow of the hill and they all see him
buster is the first to catch sight of homer he runs toward him
mary agnes also sees homer she immediately turns away and runs inside
music fades out over
mary agnes crashes into the bathroom and stumbles up to the mirror she starts to fix herself up with shaking hands
everyone has heard the news they come on the run
the children flock around homer hugging him
homer takes angela and edna in his arms
mary agnes joins the group
homer takes in how changed how attractive she is
they smile awkwardly at each other
homers suitcase is open on the bed we see homers hands as he begins to unpack
smaller hands reach in and root through the clothes
did you bring something for me
curly continues his search
homer thinks for a second then reaches into his pocket and pulls out the piece of pale green glass
you know what
homer hands the piece of glass to curly
its from the ocean
its for you
curly is duly impressed he walks away to examine his new treasure
homer continues unpacking
he pulls his x ray out and puts it aside
what are you doing here
homer turns to see buster mary agnes angela and edna in the doorway
we made up a room for you
wouldnt you be more comfortable by yourself
homer smiles he nods
angela and mary agnes start to put homers things back in his bag
edna picks up the x ray and looks at it with a somber expression
homer do you know what this is
its my heart
shakes her head actually its fuzzys
theres nothing wrong with your heart
larch wanted to keep you out of the war homer thats why he did it
thats why he told you it was yours
homer is stunned he puts his hand to his heart
i think he worried about his own heart
he said it would never stand up to homer wells going off to war
homer takes that in he nods
mary agnes touches him sympathetically
homer looks at his fake diplomas they are now framed and hanging on the office wall
homer surveys the office as if for the first time he sits down in the desk chair as if slowly getting used to his new position
homer reads to the boys from david copperfield
while his voice is strong positive optimistic certainly reassuring to the boys there is in the conclusion of the chapter something that distracts him
he seems to hesitate he misses a line or two and perhaps he purposely skips one or two others
possibly homers eyes wander ahead to the title of the next chapter i make another beginning
thus i began my new life in a new name and with everything new about me
like one in a dream
the remembrance of that life is fraught with so much
want of hope
whether it lasted for a year or more or less i do not know
i only know that it was and ceased to be and
there i leave it
homer stops and looks at the boys faces
what happens next
thats tomorrow curly
lets mot give the story away
homer puts out the lights and leaves the boys in the familiar semi darkness
seconds later the closed door to the hall is flung open flooding the room with light from the hall and homer dressed in his long white laboratory coat and looking
every inch the doctor delivers his best imitation of larchs popular blessing
good night you princes of maine
you kings of new england
on copperfield and steerforth and curly as the door to the hall is closed and semi darkness prevails in the room again
copperfield smiling shuts his eyes
after a second the wide eyed steerforth shuts his eyes too
the last to close his eyes is buster
