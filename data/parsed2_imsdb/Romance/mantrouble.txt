blue by carole eastman a
adrien joyce bruce gilbert carole eastman april a womans hands descend to the keyboard of an organ playing the opening chords to a duet from the bach cantata
the choral conductor summoning forth the sound of two womens voices singing the text
wir eilen mit schwachen doch emsigen schritten o jesu o meister
etc the latter on crutches a cast on her leg
they stand center stage their texts resting on music stands
seated off to the side are two male soloists vincent gallardo kenneth dowler
behind them a chorus of men and women waiting as he begins to sing aggressively over the duet
he suddenly drops his hands to his side
the organist discontinues and the voices of the soloists trail off spruance would you like to show me where its marked smearing here
hitting at the score because i swear i dont see it
i didnt know i was
also id be mildly content if i could have a little less delirious self appreciation and some small regard for remaining somewhere in the vicinity of the goddamned note
man trouble rev
he returns his attention to the score
while joan grumbles to helen a late arriving member of the chorus eddy revere can be seen taking his seat amongst the others i wasnt smearing
sssh come on now
no im telling you this is personally motivated
since i moved out hes been doing this making remarks and being
now if our lovely soprano would like to stop grumbling for a moment id like to take it once again
under her breath see what i mean
i said fine lets do it again
with a cold stare from the beginning please
he signals a down beat and they resume somewhere near the top of the duet
she speaks emotionally hoping to solicit sympathy he never says honey i love you youre doing a great job
i dont feel he respects me as a person and im just not that happy with the stature of our relationship
i hear you
seated behind a desk in a large deserted classroom now i want you to look at harry and tell him how you feel
she turns her gaze to eugene earl axline alias harry bliss
he sits in an adjacent chair an abject hostage
discomforted by her flinty stare he glances away to the window where the faint sounds of the choral rehearsal can be heard
i feel like hes not plugged into my needs and im not getting enough positive feedback
harry shakes his head shifting about uncomfortably
see look at him shaking his head
well lets see what he wants to say here
harry how do you feel when she brings out this material
how do i feel
i feel she just overheats on every little side issue and when i go to try and communicate with the woman for some unknown reason she doesnt believe a damn
thing i say
oh thats a lie
see what i mean
no you know what this whole thing hinges from
he came to rent a building from me which is now his place of business
so what hes not interested in that thats not what hes asking
to therapist see what she does
she wants to dig up and haul out miscellaneous things thats got nothing to do with this
i mean i agreed to come here okay but i have to tell you iwo jimas got a lot of faulty notions in her head about me that
thats another thing i want to interject
pardon me i was making a statement here
yes lets try and hear each other out if we can
go on harry
well i forgot the upshot of what i was saying but
okay this syndrome where ive asked him to address me by my given name and he just goes on ignoring my wishes
look at him and really tell him how you feel about that
i dont want you to ever call me iwo jima again
thats a legitimate request isnt it
harry begrudges a slight nod
if you cant call me adele dont call me anything at all
man trouble rev
can you look at iwo jima harry and tell her
she darts a confused frown at the therapist
better yet can you take her by the hand and say i hear what youre saying
reluctantly he reaches over and takes her hand mumbling something which though indistinct causes adeles features to pucker with emotion and brings her to the edge of tears
because theres a lot of love here isnt there
stealing a quick look at his watch a poster outside the building announces a future engagement of the lewis duart master chorale
see appendix joan comes out the door and moves down the steps to a campus walkway
joan walking quickly across the campus
joan moving with nervous alert approaches a mercedes sedan parked next to an econoline van
placing her key in the lock she notes a flyer on her windshield
she removes it glancing briefly at this heading in bold type women dont live in fear
a low rumbling sound causes her to lift her gaze over the top of the car where an attack shepherd duke slowly unsheathes his teeth and fixes her with a
threatening stare through the closed window of the van
her eyes drop down to the legend on its door panel house of bliss shepherds peace of mind twenty four hours a day call a t t a c k
man trouble rev
harry and adele moving toward the parking structure next time i want to bring out some of our sexual hot spots
the hell you are honey

as harry and adele approach the passenger door of the van at fifty bucks a shot out a my pocket
unlocking the door im going to listen to some pencil necked butthead tell me i dont know how to relate to you
daddy do you want this marriage to work or not
i hear you honey
but lets have just a little more trust on your end of this thing okay
thats all i ask
opens the door get in
a bus stop poster advertising a current knife kill movie entitled blood and kisses
a woman in jeopardy with the obligatory expression of helpless terror on her face flees from a menacing male figure wielding a bloodied knife
joan is stopped at a signal frowning up at the malevo lent message on the bus stop poster
the light changes
a car horn breaks her disturbed reverie and she proceeds through the intersection
man trouble rev
following with joan as she enters the foyer and moves along a first floor hallway to her apartment
she turns her key in the lock opens the door then steps out of joan stands briefly in the dark apprehending something untoward
she reaches to a wall switch turns on the lights and sees the living room has been completely savaged
pictures have been pulled from the walls books have been swept from the shelves chairs are upended and area rugs lie rumpled and dislocated
a vase of flowers atop a grand piano is overturned and water from it stains the polished surface
her gaze moves to a bank of windows overlooking a garden patio
the glass pane in one of them is broken and the window stands partly open
on joans stunned reaction as she fearfully scans the room
then she suddenly reaches to the front door opens it and disappears into the hallway shutting the door after her
a detective melvenos moves about glancing at the devastation
joan seated on a couch addresses him in the b
helen dextra stands on her crutches near the piano and beyond her a fingerprinter dusts for prints around the frame of the broken window
you sure nothing of value has been removed from the dwelling
thats whats so disturbing
i mean why would someone do something like this
man trouble rev
yeah you have quite a nice little mess here
poking his toe at some debris on the floor it kinda looks like somebody doesnt like you doesnt it
what do you mean somebody doesnt like me
the fingerprinter interrupts not much on the window
a few partials and a bunch of smears
check out the bedroom
as he moves to the hallway leading to the bedroom you think this is someone i know
lets explore that
have you had any recent trouble with anyone
helen hobbles into view seating herself in a nearby chair
man trouble rev
anyone whose displeasure you mightve incurred in some way
now thoroughly paranoid she frowns down at the carpet scanning her memory for the commission of some past offense
for instance just the other day we had a homicide concerning a dispute over a parking space
who could it be
youre not married i take it
her mind is still off searching for enemies and she fails to respond shes in the process of a divorce
what about him
what about him
hes our conductor hes an artist and not someone whod ever

hed never do anything like this
shrugs you never know
there is a light knock at the partially opened front door
stepping into the room hi joanie
man trouble rev
under her breath oh great
i just got in from hawaii and thought id drop by for a minute
glancing about what the heck happened in here
excuse me its my sister
not interested uhm hmm
as joan gets up and moves over to andy he glances at his watch and exits to the bedroom
andy this is not the most opportune time
i happen to have had a burglary in here last night

melvenos and the fingerprinter step out into the hallway with joan following i wanted to ask you if theres somebody who for some unknown reason doesnt like me what do

man trouble rev
i might put some bars on the windows
giving her his card my names melveny if you want to get in touch
really though i dont see how this could be somebody i know
they start down the hallway and joan addresses their backs because i actually go miles out of my way to avoid conflictual situations
helen now captive to andys epic is seated next to her on the couch attempting to listen politely to a tale without an end and to top it off my
lawyer said dont worry theyre just pissing into the wind
and i said theyre pissing into the wind but its blowing back in my face
joan has reentered the room and approaches them
some help im going to get from him because hes scared to death of red
andy are you telling me the truth
man trouble rev
turning to joan yes hes afraid theyre all afraid theyre all off skiing
speaking of lawyers
tapping on her cast one fell on me while i was sunbathing
i mean are you really going to new york
yes im going to new york where i intend to remain in semi private seclusion at an undisclosed
well maybe i could stay at your house while youre gone
so could you tell your housekeeper to

pardon me but i dont care what he said
my apartment as you can see is a complete shambles i have a terrible headache ive been informed that somebody doesnt like me and i really dont want to stay
here by myself

joan sinks down into a chair exhausted thank you
gee whiz why make such a big deal out of everything
man trouble rev
to helen i just got off a plane that almost fell into the pacific ocean like a piece of rotten fruit
to joan but did i mention it
duke lies on the floor watching harry
he stands at a cork board on the wall behind his desk adding a clipping announcing the fourth victim of a local serial killer called the westside slasher to an
assortment of other items on violent crimes
as he does june huff enters from a door of the rear of the office
moving past harrys desk she picks up a folded newspaper page continues to an upholstered bench beneath a window lies down and begins reading
moving to his desk now dont start lazing around june
lets get with it
under her breath you get with it
he sits down at his desk and begins going through his drawers looking for something
she lowers the paper and looks over at him do you like my hair this way or do you like it straight
its very nice sluggo

she goes back to reading
where the hell are my nail clippers
the phone on his desk begins to ring i told everybody to stay out of these drawers

man trouble rev
dont give me a bad time lard
ive got enough trouble with iwo jima and her complaints alright

suddenly irritated he begins fumbling through a pile of bills on top of the desk you know whats gonna happen if i cant pay these damn breeders and get some
adult dogs on the premises
pretty damn quick some asses are going to hit the pavement believe me
im sick of dog turds anyway
he scowls at her then looks out the window jesus here i am sitting in the center of a lot of wealth the escalation in crime couldnt be better and
im not turning a damn nickel on it
he catches sight of something outside oh shit
across the street a van not unlike harrys can be seen
on the sidewalk beyond it a man lee stands putting coins in a parking meter
moving quickly into the doorway to the reception area man trouble rev
im in vegas delivering a couple a dogs to wayne newton
to the dog duke fuss
to june you dont know when to expect me
he and the dog disappear from view
joan is seated at the piano playing ravels reverie
she breaks off as she sees a dark young man balto move past the living room window
she resumes playing until her attention is once again drawn to the window where a middle aged hispanic woman socorro moves past in the opposite direction with a young man
who now carries a suitcase
she rises and crosses to the windows to see them get into a gaudy low rider and begin backing down the driveway
joan hurries out of the house and runs down the drive way toward the low rider calling out socorro
wait a minute
i want to talk to you
the low rider comes to a stop
joan approaches the pas senger window and leans down to socorro excuse me socorro but do you mind if i ask whats happening why are you leaving
no se lo siento
im asking where are you going
indicating balto esto me yerno balthazar
you speak please balto para mi
man trouble rev
yes whats going on are you bringing her back later or what
yeah monday i bring her back
but this is thursday i cant stay here alone til monday
its my understanding si lunes lunes
that socorro lived here otherwise i wouldve made other plans
yeah but she got her time off too man you know
joan straightens up sighing angrily and looking up at the house well this is just glorious
the low rider moves down the driveway and as it disap pears onto the street joan moves to an electric box atop a metal column at the edge of the
she presses the button and looks at the gates
they remain open
she steps over to the gates and tries to close them manually
the locking device fails to engage and a portion of it falls off into the bushes
as she leans down to look for the fallen part a pickup truck can be seen parked down the street
the back of the drivers head butch gable can be seen and on the side panel of the truck are the words canyon tree surgeons
giving up on the gates joan turns and moves with evident reluctance up the driveway passing a three car garage in which her mercedes and another car hidden under a
trap can be seen
man trouble rev
joan is asleep on the bed
lying beside her is a fireplace poker and a mallet meat tenderizer
across the dark room a trailer of blood and kisses plays on the tv screen
the scantily clad woman previously seen on the bus stop poster backs away from a steadily stalking camera
her eyes widen in the familiar expression of helpless terror and as she opens her mouth to scream joan flinches and sits up
she turns the tv off which descends into a wooden console
at that moment there is a voice from outside the bedroom window hey andy
in the vicinity of the bedroom window a man in work clothes can be seen pounding on the glass as he continues yelling its butch
get your ass in gear and say hello to your old drinking buddy
she calls loudly out to him andys not here
he moves to the glass facade and peers inside looking for the source of the voice well who are you honey
shes out of town and there happens to be several other people in here trying to sleep so
whynt you come out and say hello
will you please go away
come on stick your head out the door an lets see what you look like
man trouble rev
im sorry but if you dont leave im going to call the foothill patrol
well fuck you honey
he cups a hand over his crotch and sticking his tongue out flicks it in an obscene manner across his lips
tch where does she find these people
i was just trying to be nice
moving backwards to the flower bed go ahead an call em bitch i dont give a shit
he leans down picks up a dirt clod from the flower bed and throws it toward the window ill just come back and kick your ass in for you
joan moves along the windows with her weapons in hand watching as butch wavers erratically up to the driveway where the previously seen pickup can be seen
she waits until he gets in and drives off then she moves back into the bedroom
joan pacing about in nervous distress
she stops abruptly throws her weapons onto the bed and moves purposively to her handbag
rummaging through it she finds the house of bliss flyer unfolds it and looks at the reassuring photograph of harry and duke
posed in an alert stance duke breaks into a run loping gracefully across the lawn to harry where he assumes a sitting position upon the command man trouble rev
to joan always the name first and then the command
she stands off to the side repeating the command and studiously writing it down in a small notebook
now in regard to any aggressor seeking to give you a bad time i want to show you what you can expect from a dog of this caliber
he takes hold of the dogs muzzle lifting the lips to reveal the large scimitar like canines here we have the dogs arsenal so to speak
the animal is trained to apply pressure to specific points of the body until the bone is more or less crushed
releasing the muzzle if the attacker is bearing a weapon of any kind be it a gun a club a knife or what have you the dog will excuse me
politely indicating his crotch automatically go for the testicles
oh god what if i dont want him to do that
you want him to do that
no i just want him to scare someone
believe me this will scare them as well as incapacitate their mind and any ability to maneuver against you
you know i have an extremely sensitive reaction to dog dander so maybe i shouldnt
let me ask you something
i like to get a general picture of the individual situation im working with
man trouble rev
he pauses to light a cigarette making a quick reflexive appraisal of her contours as he does are you married single living alone or with some other party
im in the process of a divorce and i moved up here because my apartment was burglarized and
suddenly mistrustful but im not entirely alone theres a housekeeper here and several friends
well the hills are hit heaven as far as burglaries go
and right up on mulholland is where they found the fifth victim of the westside slasher
no please dont tell me about that
believe me i know what youre up against being an attractive and i take it unattached woman such as you are
flicking his cigarettte away but were going to remedy that situation right now and get you to feeling as safe as a little baby alright
indicating her notebook whatve we got there so far
reading her notes ober platz geh am platz bringen komm sitz fuss fahrt and blieb
man trouble rev
well thats enough for a start on the basic control commands
he scans the grounds for signs of something we as yet know nothing of now lets do a little work with the assailant
she holds duke on a short lead and as they move along a wooded area of the grounds he leans in close directing her in confidential tones alright now joan
give him the command duke wachen sie
duke wachen sie
the dog is now on alert
as they walk harry glances about impressed with the appearance of wealth inherent in the house and grounds this is really a nice piece of real estate youve got here
tense and distracted its not mine its my sisters
oh its your sisters
pause and wheres she
looking down at duke am i doing this right
shouldnt i be prepared for something
never look at your dog
man trouble rev
never look at your dog
they move forward a few feet when harry now slightly behind joan makes a covert hand signal in the direction of some trees several yards ahead of them
june in a padded attack suit suddenly jumps out from behind the trees assuming an aggressive stance and emitting a repertory of menacing sounds
oh my god
duke responds immediately lunging toward june pulling joan along with him
june screams and starts to run away
harry moves after joan yelling ahead to june dammit june dont exhibit fear until i tell you
seeing the dog still in pursuit june ignores the command and as duke continues to tow joan behind him get him under control now joan
struggling with duke good boy be nice
give him the off command
i forgot it
you tell him
he hurries up behind her grabbing her around the waist to anchor her and addressing the dog duke aus
the dog instantly assumes a sitting position
joan out of breath and exhilarated with fear and excitement turns to harry man trouble rev
my golly that was incredible
i love this dog
did you see that
i cant believe how strong he is
i felt like a rag doll
what did i tell you
at the desk making out a check while harry in the b
takes in a series of photographs on the den wall of some of the highlights in the life of andy ellerman
see appendix ordinarily i wouldnt do this even on a temporary rental basis because hes the absolute top security and attack dog in the country
she lays the pen aside studying him with evident interest as he looks at a photograph of andy and a man on a hunting safari in africa
is this your sister
yes thats her with her third husband eric ellerman
moving to another photograph wait a minute whos this guy isnt this red layls
your sisters involved with red layls
this guys gotta be one of the five or ten richest men in the country with business connections all over the place
man trouble rev
feeling slighted she watches him move to a picture of andy descending the steps of a plane with layls watching her on the tarmac
and shes your sister
i mean this is an individual id really like to meet sometime
he leans in close to a photograph of andy in a bikini
boy look at that figure
i have to say your sister is really an attractive looking woman
well thats quite a compliment
ill have to pass it on
june in the b
still in the attack jacket leaning sullenly against the van and watching harry work
ill skip back up in a day or two okay just to see how youre doing
and joan i want you to know its been a great pleasure doing business with you
her gaze flits shyly away thank you
feel free to call on me for anything
anytime of the night or day hours
and would you also thank your
as she gestures toward june harry takes hold of her hand looking earnestly at her
i sincerely mean that
as harry unzips the attack jacket you big flirt
come on dumpty dont start that
removing the jacket this is quality clientele
it calls for a certain kind of approach
nods toward the house just soak some of this in will you
he steps past her and goes to the van giving him the finger soak this
as he opens the back panel start to pattern yourself
tossing the jacket inside the van observe the woman for christ sakes
oh screw her
he closes the back panel and as he moves past her you dont screw this type of individual
on his way to the drivers door
this is the kind of atmosphere we want to gravitate toward
opening the door did she even ask me the cost
as he gets inside dammit i really respect that
grumbling as she moves to the passenger door well i dont he isnt even your dog
joan her mood light hearted enters with duke following
she crosses to the closet selects a change of clothes and moves to lay them out on the bed
noting the message light blinking on her answering machine she steps over to the night stand presses the playback and to a series of tones preceding the recorded messages the
indistinct sounds of a taped message over joan turns the tap on in the wash basin and begins splashing water on her face
then as she reaches to a towel and turns the tap off the words of a popular rock song can be heard
exhibiting some curiosity she exits the bathroom
joan stands holding the towel over her mouth staring down at the answering machine
issuing from it a mans voice in an eerily whispered falsetto singing the words every breath you take every move you make ill be watching you
man trouble rev
above music faintly over once again joan is stopped at a signal
aware of someone watching her she turns to look through the window
a man in an adjacent car is staring at her and momentarily addresses her with a peculiar request how about a little smile
she quickly faces front and as the light changes accelerates through the intersecion
conducting the soprano section of the et resurrexit accompanied by the pianist
the previously seen eddy revere among them
seated on a lower level of the tiered chairs arranged in a semi circle around lewie
her eyes fixed on lewie intensely perusing him for any signs of malevolence
as he addresses the sopranos over their voices
this is supposed to sound virginal ladies so lets try to fake it
singing and their various reactions to the above remark
man trouble rev
he lies on the lawn secured to the base of a tree by a long leash
eddy moves into view and stepping over to duke leans down as though he intends to pet him dont do that
he turns to see joan approaching with a paper cup filled with water
dont do what
youre not supposed to look him straight in the eye
you have a dog you cant look in the eye joan
hes not just a dog
hes a schutzhund trained attack dog
he steps back from the dog as joan leans down to give duke some water from the cup
i was told to avoid a direct gaze and always look at the base of the right or the left ear
you dont have to go to all this trouble ive offered to stay up at your sisters with you
i cant tell you how mad i am at lewie that i have to leave him out here tied to a tree
god youre stubborn joan
man trouble rev
im not stubborn im so accommodating its sickening
she pats duke on the head and stands up but you wont tell me whats really bothering you
why dont you confide in me anymore
no you dont
come on talk to me
lets go have a drink after rehearsal
a woman chorus member sticks her head out the stage door eddy you better come hes rehearsing the tenors
then to joan how about tomorrow night then
i dont know
lets say maybe
slightly annoyed well dont go out of your way joan
he moves quickly toward the rehearsal room
immediately afraid of his displeasure she calls after him eddy
before disappearing into the studio he makes a gesture acknowledging her capitulation
j man trouble rev
harry joan and duke following moves along the glass facade inspecting then assessing the security status of the house well id have to say this place is a snap to
i knew it
i shouldnt have moved here
the dogll take care of anyone trying to get inside
she moves down into the living room crossing toward one of the couches with harry following i dont know what to do
maybe i should move into a motel
no you dont have to do that
this is just some ding dong thats trying to scare you
well hes succeeded
she sits down
but you dont want to give off that impression by acting too timid or afraid because thats what invites an aggressive attitude from certain types of men
i didnt invite this
for instance dont go mincing along taking mousey little steps and waving your hanky because youre drawing a target on yourself if you do
do i do that
j man trouble rev
well lets see
just walk back and forth the way you normally do
stands up well i dont normally walk back and forth but
she attempts a few steps then stops abruptly im sorry i cant do it with you watching me
okay but keep in mind that you want to exhibit a very confident attitude
look like you know what youre doing and where youre going
just remember to stop short of appearing a little dykey because thats not attractive
but i thought thats your point no to attract
no no you always want to remain a little bit attractive
otherwise that can set somone off too
this is just impossible
she moves back to the couch and sits down
you just cant win
sure you can its just a matter of degree
well darn it i give up
dropping her head into her hands
j man trouble rev
moves over to her and touches her gently now whats this
im sorry but this is really getting to me
he sits down next to her tell you what
let me take you out of here buy you a drink and see if we cant get your mind off these kind of things
thats very sweet of you harry
id like to do that
man trouble rev
japanese mood music over featuring a morbid nearly suicidal saxophone solo john and harry seated at a table
she is well past the loosening effects of a second glass of wine is not unaware that harry is looking at her he lights a cigarette
as she reaches to her glass his eyes follow the motion of her hands
she looks in front the window how long have you been divorced
oh id say seven or eight years around there
and so you like well assuming you live a single existence i mean most men dont seem to enjoy that ive read
she lifts her glass takes a sip then sets it back down i have to tell you the truth
he pauses ive been observing your hands and i have to use the word exquisite
man trouble rev
embarrassed by the compliment she reaches to her glass and nearly knocks it over spilling a bit of wine onto the tablecloth and is relieved to find him gazing off
and unaware of her gaffe
youre probably quite a singer too
looking back to her id like to come down and catch you sometime
do you like classical music
even to the degree that when its playing on the radio i sometimes have to turn the damn thing off
thinking he is revealing a peculiar brand of wit she laughs
i just mean it starts to get to me too much
i cant swallow my saliva
i shouldnt have laughed
yeah symphonies operettas poems things like that
all those type of things really get to me
looking intensely at him uhm hmm
a japanese hostess appears at the table bowing reveren tially and gesturing that their table is ready
joan and harry at a window table
a number of serving dishes and plates on the table indicate the completion of their meal
man trouble rev
she is flushed from the wine and exhilarated by her response to harry youre full of surprises harry you know that
that youve actually read dantes divine comedy i mean
well it was a while back there that i did yeah
you know that part
yet as a wheel moves smoothly free from jars my will and my desire were turned by love the love that moves the sun and other stars
he nods while joan hoping to disguise the extent of her emotions looks down and begins moving her wine in circles for some reason the sublimity of that always touches
man trouble rev
joan and harry come down the steps of the inn
the sun has gone down and the lights of the city have come on
under the following they cross the driveway to a low fence railing off an oriental garden
you know its very sad
i look at my sister and all her marriages and affairs not to mention the mess my own life is in and i think its very sad and very bleak
that men and women cant manage to be friends
it depends on the man and woman youre talking about
they arrive at the fence and as she speaks she rests one of her hands on the railings what a tragedy that sex is often such a barrier to friendship
between men and women
there i disagree with you
he places his hand over hers
she remains silent a moment restraining her response to the gesture
then you know dante and beatrice never slept together
is that right
catching himself oh yeah i forgot that part
i shouldnt have had so much wine
because i prefer to go a little slow here
we can go as slow as you want
man trouble rev
looking at him you think men and women can be friends
oh yeah absolutely
joan accompanied by duke moves down the driveway to a mailbox in front of the broken gates
she pauses to lavish the dog with an exuberant display of affection and finds herself intimidated as he responds by leaping about and barking joyously alright now dont play too
the excitement has unleashed dukes libido and as she tries to resume her mission he makes a few attempts to rise against her flanks
just before she approaches the mailbox he manages to grip his paws around one of her thighs and unmistakably begins to hump her no no duke dont do that thats
and behave yourself
he sits panting with a furtive expression on his face watching as she steps over to the mailbox and opens it
she takes out a number of letters and sorts through them as she starts back to the house with duke following
they are in the main addressed to andy but in amongst them she finds a bank statement addressed to her as well as a letter with her name written in
pencil on the envelope
she opens it takes the contents out and stops suddenly holding a woodcut with a foxed edge revealing it was torn from the pages of a book
it is of a woman kneeling with her head on the block while above her a hooded executioner stands with an ax in his hand
man trouble rev
joan and helen seated at a table near the concessionary building
the latter sits tense and disturbed an uneaten sandwich in front of her as helen reads from a list of suspects
lewie can be seen at another table seated across from a bearded man
the other members of the chorale including the male soloists are variously seated moving about or lounging on the campus lawn having their lunch
mad at me
the camera peruses lewie
doesnt want a divorce
maybe hes trying to scare me or punish me
helen leans her head in close to joans its definitely not lewie
youre not exactly a disinterested party
youre always promoting his cause
number one ive known the man for fifteen years number two he
she glances at eddy then consults the list seated on the lawn nearby paring an apple with a swiss army knife eddy revere a little moody but a good friend
and very reliable
an opinion i dont share but
what do you think about vincent
man trouble rev
gesturing expansively as he relates some incident to his table partners he has a terrible temper
we know that
weve never had an unpleasant word
arent you lucky
he stands with a styrofoam cup in his hand coming on to one of the members of the female chorus always trying to connect with me proposing private rehearsals at
you know what he asked me yesterday
what my cup size was
back to the list steve jewel
whos steve jewel
my piano tuner
is he weird or something
well everyone appears weird to me right now
so i put every possible name down except for one who happens to be post burglary
helen returns to the list tapping her finger on one of the names
i think its him the tree surgeon
he sounds very suspicious
just dont tell lewie about the phone message or the thing i got in the mail because hell just use it to
i already did
joan and lewie stand in the doorway of the rehearsal room
a portion of the chorus membership are seated in chairs and some including eddy revere and helen show occasional interest in the intense exchange taking place at the door im
extremely concerned about this situation
i dont want you living alone up there
she regards him suspiciously
he modulates his voice to a more persuasive and intimate tone now come on wouldnt you feel much safer if you moved back into our house
no i wouldnt feel comfortable about doing that
he takes hold of her arm and moves her out into the hall darn it lewie
are you afraid of your responses to me
amorously why are you resisting
these are very upsetting really shitty circumstances im dealing with and i
do you know how hard all this has been on me
do you think its that easy for me to admit i want you back
couldnt you spare yourself then
are you seeing anybody
just tell me that
she rolls her eyes sighing impatiently
come on youre not the abstinent type
please dont judge me by your scrotal excesses lewie
i know youre seeing somebody
suspicious again are you spying on me
be open about it
kisses her on the neck then who is it
her gaze meets helens who misconstruing the situation makes an ok sign delivering her semiotic sanction to the happy reunion in the hallway
back to lewie alright i am seeing someone okay
he pulls back narrowing his eyes at her i dont believe you
who is it
outside joan and harry dine
the patio is lit only by candles on the table
socorro enters the living room with a tray holding a coffee urn and cup and closely tailed by duke
she moves toward the patio
socorro sets the tray down and departs for the kitchen with duke again falling in behind her
joan begins to pour their coffee glancing inside the house to see
socorro turning lights out while the indefatigable duke tries to mount her
uttering some impatient complaint she swipes at him with a napkin and the two move out of view through the kitchen door
you know i hate to mention this but were having a slight problem with duke
hands him a cup he keeps getting up and trying to ride on ones extremities
oh dont worry about that
man trouble rev
especially socorro who cant speak english let alone german and sometimes she has to go pulling him from room to room like a vacuum cleaner
no thats just normal in most of your adult males
some percentage of the time theyre gonna attempt to make these vulgar motions on your person
he places his arm on the couch behind her you just have to be very firm and stay on top of him
in the sky beyond the hills a helicopter beams its light
joan and harry are seated on the couch having coffee as they listen to a chopin nocturne
he is doing his best to emulate her posture of thoughtful intensity as she listens but as he steals a look at her his adult male impulses causes him to
shift about slightly
she looks over at him its not affecting you too much is it
no its very nice
its chopin a nocturne
you know whats affecting me
night piece it means
he reaches over and runs his hand slowly down her back
i think i should say something
dont worry about it
thats the problem though i want to be honest with you
theres no problem
he leans over and kisses her
after a moment she breaks off because i recently realized something about myself
that ive slept with a number of men in my life just because i didnt want them not to like me
not averse to being one of them uhm hmm
but the thing is i didnt like most of them that much so why did i care whether they liked me or not
you know im not one of these guys whos going to look upon you as an object
oh i know thats not what im saying
because i look upon a woman as a whole
what im saying is i dont know if right now i might not go to bed with you because i dont want to be alone so i thought maybe we
could try to explore other modes or
man trouble rev
i mean there are other ways of being intimate that people dont even realize
which doesnt mean im not attracted to you
but you dont want me to bring you around
other modes is fine
you dont have to be shy with me
moving closer to her ive been asked to do do every kind of thing in the book
he kisses her once more
her response is far less tentative
as it begins to border on the ardent she breaks off again god its so hard to pioneer in this area
when you keep doing that
joan and harry tussle about with abandoned fervor under the covers of the bed
a fire is burning in the fireplace
presently the phone rings followed by on answering machine please leave a message after the tone
man trouble rev
the beep is followed by andys voice in some waning stage of sedation coming from the phone speaker joan
are you there
pause i want to inform you that these people are drugging me
andy speaking covertly into a telephone
she wears a hospital smock and is seated on the edge of bed occupied by a woman in a drug induced state of oblivion
theres no phone in my room or cable tv
ive had to sneak into this cell next to me with some poor lithium zombie lying here like a comatose cabbage
her expression shows some concern maybe i better take this
she tries to move closer to the phone hindered by harrys weight
and this is the lengths this assassin is willing to go to suppress me because he does not want me to have my book
harry excuse me its my sister
he moves off of her and she leans across his torso pinning him to the bed as she addresses the speaker andy
intercut between joan and oh youre there
where are you
are you in new york
no thats what im telling you
i went into the hospital first for one day just to have a simple bone spur
i know you told me that but where are you now
and the next thing i know im transported some place the hell else against my knowledge while i was completely medicated
andy wait a minute
do you understand the implications of this i have no underpants on and absolutely no recourse to my rights
joan sits up and in her alarm is unaware that one of her hands grabs hold of a swatch of hair on harrys chest causing him to wince oh god
this is because of red isnt it
yes its because of red isnt that obvious
evidencing interest in their exchange harry manages to reach to his cigarettes on the night stand
and if he and that fuckface lawyer in his paid employ think they can wait
whispering i think i hear someone
joan turns to harry a stricken look on her face what am i supposed to do
find out where she is
you have to tell me where you are
man trouble rev
i told you i dont know where i am these bastards are very clever
she looks at the heavily meshed wires covering the window im in some private cracker box in the boonies with godammed wires on the windows
ask her the name of the first hospital
andy tell me the name of the hospital you checked yourself into
mount haven its in the south bay and dont ask me these inane questions just do something
tell her well find it
well find it okay so dont worry
i hear someone coming i have to get off
because im sure theres some simple explanation
she is cut short by the abrupt sound of the phone hanging up on the other end
again she turns to harry what should i do
should i call the police
he reaches to an ashtray on the night stand and quickly douses his cigarette
lets just take a run out there
hesitant and fearful you mean right now
as joans car creeps along on a saturday night freeway bottling up a line of cars behind
harry is none too happily confined to the passenger seat as joan white knuckling on the wheel obsesses on andy i told her she shouldnt do this i mean to
be so maniacally obsessed with this soul of mud that shed even want to write a book about him is beyond me
well the guy must be doing something right to have amassed that amount of wealth
but she does this you know she just periodically drops the entire weight of her life on me like a ton of bricks
joan can i make a suggestion
yes please anything
you better try an keep up a little with the flow or were gonna get cited
harry stands scowling for effect his arm around joan
a male admissions clerk sits at a computer behind a counter keying up a file then reading if off the screen ellerman antonia
she was admitted on the third of the month and was signed out at p
on the fourth by her personal physician
how do you know he was her physician
hell i could come in here and say i was a doctor an sign somebody out
and even if he was a doctor it doesnt mean he was my sisters doctor
according to this he was her doctor
then who was the doctor who operated on her foot
looking at screen theres nothing on here about her foot
it says observation for clinical depression
thats a lie
she was in here for an operation then she was drugged and taken out of here against her will
that couldnt possibly happen we have very strict regulations about
man trouble rev
okay lets stop wasting time here where is this guy whats his name
looking at the screen his name is dr
back to them it doesnt say where he is
i cant believe this you mean theres no phone number or address
im sorry but i didnt type this file
what kind of business are you running here buddy
all i can do is give you the data i have on here
if you want to call the physicians registry
gestures to a bank of pay phones theres some public phones over there
hes probably listed with them
he turns away from them and back to the computer
joan wanders anxiously around the waiting room
in the b
harry can be seen at one of the pay phones
seeing him hang up she stops pacing and looks toward him
pov he approaches answering her expectant look with a shake of the head and the disheartening news nothing
harry and joan moving toward the hospital parking lot how am i supposed to find this man
maybe he used a false name or maybe he isnt even a doctor
ive got a couple of ideas here
first we want to try an connect with red layls
no i dont want anything to do with red im terrified of him
theres nothing to be afraid of believe me
i mean you hear all kinds of things about government kickbacks and panamanian drug couriers and
i know these type of guys
you take away their money and their power and what are they
no really i have to do something
i have to go to the police
he stops walking and takes a hold of her hand just hold off a bit on that honey will you
oh thats nice
you called me honey
well thats what you are
man trouble rev
he puts an arm around her speaking in reassuring tones i want to get a hold of this top private investigator whos a close personal friend of mine okay and
get him to find out who this doctor is
harry this isnt your problem and i dont want to draw you into it
dont worry were going to find your sister
he kisses her everythings going to turn out fine
reading sixth victim of westside slasher
the angle shifts to reveal harry seated at a table next to a plate glass window reading the above paper
the view is inclusive of the house of bliss across the street
he lowers the paper as a waitress vita appears with a silex of coffee
she sits down opposite him refilling his cup and addressing him in a familiar manner okay go ahead ive gotta hear this
who is it this time
no its not what you think
this is a very unique individual im talking about
plus theres a mind there as well as a body and a face
didnt i hear this before about the hostess at dennys that was a college graduate and had a mole like elizabeth taylor
man trouble rev
im telling you this is something completely different
you gotta meet her
she sings opera and has the hands of a hula dancer
under the following june can be seen crossing the street from the house of bliss and approaching the coffee shop anyway you remember that private detective that use to come
in here all the time
on the portly side bald had kind of crossed eyes
fred you mean
yeah thats him
how do you think i could get a hold of him
oh gee i think hes moved out of the area and went into gourmet snacks
harrys attention is drawn to june tapping on the window
june mouthing theres some guy over there wants to see you
then she gestures to a continental town car in the parking lot next to the house of bliss
harry stands back uneasily regarding the smoked windows and the sun flaring off the glossy surfaces of the car
man trouble rev
presently the passenger door opens and l
moncrief a barely discernible presence in a suit blending in with the dark interior of the car addresses him by name mr
bliss id like to have word with you if i may
on june standing on the sidewalk next to the house of bliss looking at harry and as he disappears into the car she turns and goes inside the building
the camera makes a slow circuit around the continental taking in an aerial protruding from the trunk and below it a license plate with the word typhon on it
the move continues briefly scanning a driver with a nasty recidivist face seated behind the wheel and as we come full circle the passenger door opens and harry gets out
he slams the door and steps back angrily glaring at the car
the hydraulic window opens and moncrief looks out at him youre talking to the wrong godammed party you know that
i think its in your best interest to hear me out
no you hear me out friend
he takes note of the driver sturge coming around the front of the car
he stops a few feet off and unbuttons his jacket revealing the cross strap of a shoulder holster
harry steps over to the window leans down and communicates in more politic tones look i happen to have a very high regard for this party
and maybe i even have some feelings of a personal nature here
well i dont want to appear to be taking unfair advantage of you
man trouble rev
moncrief reaches into a briefcase takes out a folder and makes reference to its contents as he speaks but in developing certain information on you its come to our attention
that your name isnt harry bliss
that in fact your name is eugene earl axline
wait a minute
and that both the i
and an impressive number of creditors in several eastern cities
looks up at harry seem to be somewhat interested in your whereabouts
harry stands up leaving the vulnerable area of his stomach framed in the passenger window
when he leans back down a deeply conflicted expression is apparent on his face you know thats not necessarily entirely accurate i mean i dont know where you come up
with these so called facts but
at a loss he looks off shaking his head i cant go sneaking around stealing this ladys property
id like to pose that the name and reputation of this very decent man is not the property of mrs
ellerman or her sister
he takes a voucher from the folder and sets the file aside man trouble rev
and its my hope that we can avoid any unpleasant eventualities either for you or for someone you have such admirable feelings toward
what do you mean unpleasant
i mean that mr
layls is prepared to do whatever it takes to confiscate this document
and if youd like to be of some assistance to us by finding it and turning it over to me hed like to offer you this very generous gift
he holds the voucher out to harry who avoids looking at it jesus christ i hardly know the woman
im just renting a dog to her thats all
looking at moncrief what kind of a person do you take me for
harry stands in the parking lot watching as the con tinental drives off
he starts to move toward the house of bliss then stops and opens the voucher braving a look at it
signed by l
moncrief and made out to the sum of
joans car pulls onto the street leading to andys house
her gaze is drawn to a pickup parked on the street and as she passes the vehicles she turns to look at man trouble rev
sits in the pickup
a pile of recently trimmed tree branches litter the ground near the truck
he turns his head to look at her
joan gets out of the mercedes and opens the gates
as she moves back to the drivers door she glances at butch then gets quickly into the car
she drives in through the gates and once again gets out to close them behind her
he watches sullenly as her car disappears through the gates then lifts a can of beer to his mouth and drinks
joan searches through the file cabinets and not finding what shes looking for goes through a similar course of procedure with the desk drawers
on an upstairs landing she searches through some drawers and cupboards
then spotting socorro on the level below oh socorro
could you come in here por favor
as socorro comes to the landing joan indicates one of the open desk drawers i am looking for my sisters book
socorro steps closer and glancing into the the now disorderly contents of the drawer shakes her head defensively no
no es mi
man trouble rev
la manuscripto holding an empty manila envelope in her hand de mi hermana andy si
pointing at herself i go
toda la casa
makes a wide sweeping gesture with her hand everywhere
looking y looking
pointing at her own eye and no es anywhere
socorro smiles apologetically no se no entiendo
backing away lo siento
continuing to mumble some disclaimer she moves out into the hallway and disappears
joan rifles through the drawers of a small escritoire against the back wall of the bedroom
then she moves toward the dressing area giving off to the bathroom and stops as she sees the top rung of a ladder just visible above the bottom ledge of
a window adjacent to the shower
a small section of glass has been removed just large enough to permit the entry of hand to the window lock
harry behind his desk irritable avoiding eye contact with joan who is seated across from him on the window bench
see appendix for new items visible on the crime collage behind harry
i told this detective i wanted to press charges against red layls for abducting andy for burglarizing my apartment for breaking into her house
oh come on youre way off
and that hes been trying to scare and intimidate me in case i might have read something in her manuscript that he doesnt want anybody to know
and you know what he said
that i havent given him probable cause to even go and question red layls or his lawyer
well hes right i couldve told you that
this is a man who goes fishing with the president honey
grabs a pack of cigarettes hes a little high up to go around burglarizing people and sending them nasty notes
so why dont you just ease back on this thing for awhile
lighting up lifes too godammed short
i cant do that harry
this is my sister
i can at least make out a missing persons report on her and then i want to talk to the private detective friend of yours
im trying to chase the guy down okay
but dont go and make yourself sick
he begins pushing the paraphernalia around on his desk i mean jesus why dont you just get this damn thing and hand it over to me and ill give it
to these guys
man trouble rev
you mean to red
yeah to red or whoever
well if i ever find it thats the last thing id do with it
dammit youre making my work more difficult for me you know that
what is this have i come at the wrong time or something
i tell you what the hell to do and you dont listen to me
joan looks down at the floor attempting a drollery well someone abates your maidenhood and suddenly feels they can start ordering you around
im not ordering you around
im just giving you my opinion
and maybe i get tired of hearing about this stuff all the time this book business this manu whatever and red layls and your sister
deeply hurt im sorry if ive overtaxed you with my problems harry but i never asked you to consider them a part of your work
stands up so why dont we speak when youre in a better frame of mind
as she crosss to the door harry stands up ah honey now
aw honey yourself
she disappears into the reception room and can be heard going out the door
harry moves to the window unhappily watching as joan gets into the mercedes and drives off
again seated at his desk
he stares out the window in the throes of a moral conflict
then making some sudden resolve he opens a drawer takes out an envelope and a paperback book and lays them on the desk
the price sticker is still attached above the title dantes divine comedy simplified edition
he opens the book removes the typhon voucher from between its pages and begins addressing the envelope with the information on the check
then he puts the voucher into the envelope and seals it
harry envelope in hand moves with determination down the block from his building
he approaches a mailbox pulls the handle on the letter drop and inserts his hand inside the chute
he holds it there a moment seized by indecision and then brings his hand back out still holding the envelope
turning around he angrily stuffs it into his back pocket and heads back to the house of bliss
joan carrying two glasses of beer crosses to exit the kitchen the ubiquitous duke trailing after her
she pauses to address socorro at the service island vigorously hacking at the pink cadaver of chicken and tossing the dismembered pieces into a stewing pot oh socorro please keep
the dog el perro in
in piso inferior por favor
man trouble rev
duke venga aqui
duke returns to the kitchen and joan moves into an enter tainment alcove off the living room
helen is seated on a couch eating a slice of pizza from a delivery box on the coffee table her attention on the tv where a talk show is in
progress over above action and now id like you to meet the director and the star of the smash hit movie blood and kisses
so lets give them a nice warm welcome
on a large tv screen where a fervently solicitous host addresses the director
seated beside him is the actress previously seen on the billboard and in the movie trailer of blood and kisses
before we begin why dont we show the audience a clip from the movie
do you want to set it up for us
well its a bit
this scene involves
just go ahead and run it
after clip to the director i must say this is a dazzling piece of work and you two are a dynamite wedding of talents
joan hands helen one of the glasses then sits down beside her
under the following she picks up a pen and leans over the police document now resting on the coffee table
man trouble rev
but i hear youre a little sensitive about the criticism youve had about the amount of sexual violence and nudity you have in the picture
any scars marks or tattoos
overlapping her well its absurd
in the first place i didnt invent this genre
and it happens to be a tradition in this kind of film that women make more interesting and exciting victims than men do
well i understand
she looks up from the document to the screen
then both women look at each other with their mouths open and secondly the violence directed at mimis character is an essential component of the story and is not in
any sense of the word gratuitous
as the host turns to the actress but mimi now what about you
that scene where you run nude through times square with those multiple knife wounds all over your body
that mustve been horrendous for you
as she throws the pen down onto the coffee table assholes
yes it was very horrendous
to helen come on let me drive you home
man trouble rev
but what helped me enormously is that we shot the film in sequence
thru thru june lying on a studio couch with a remote control in her hand looking at the actress and that scene came directly after the gang rape in the
harry steps into view only half listening and grumbling whats her problem
also i love dicks taste so i knew he was handling it very artistically
now whats she complaining about
he holds out his hand to june requesting the remote control give me that
well youre just delightful in the movie and youre both great fun to have on the show
thanks for coming
to camera iwos got some shit shes dont go away well be looking at
before you go lets look at another clip from blood and kisses
man trouble rev
i come over here to look at the ball game and you give me these clowns
a commercial comes on
june hands him the remote and he sits down on the couch channeling to a baseball game i mean whats wrong with these women
you want a know something
they dont want to hear the truth thats what disturbs me
man trouble rev
theres some people that dont treat me like you do
you tell them the truth and they come at you with a cleaver
i know one guy that says very complimentary things to me like that i have nice features and a sense of humor
some guy i met that likes me
he looks at her then reaches over and places a hand affectionately on the nape of her neck youre going to leave me lard just after ive broken you in
and taught you the fine art of dog training
waits for a response then as if you cared
shakes his head and sighs women
then back to the tv whats the score
joan and helen enter the garage
joan gets into the drivers seat and closes the door while helen maneuvers on her crutches around to the passenger side
joan turns the ignition on and as she starts to buckle herself in her eye catches the movement of something at the back of the garage
from behind a sheet of plywood resting against the back wall of the garage and just visible in the darkness a mans hand can be seen reaching to the handle
of an ax in amongst other gardening tools in an iron rack
helen opens the passenger door and joan whispers to her helen quick get in the car
helen leans down and looks in at her what
looking in the direction of joans gaze she sees the dark figure of a man wearing a hood over his head stepping out from behind the sheet of plywood holding
the ax in his hand and as he moves toward the front of the car she screams
he lifts the ax over his head and swings it down vio lently cleaving the blade into the hood of the mercedes
from inside the house duke can be heard barking furiously
joan leaps from the car and in stark terror runs out of the garage toward the house
stopped by the sounds of helens hysteria she turns around to see her hampered by her crutches and unable to move
on the hooded mans eyes shifting their homicidal intent from helen to joan
joan runs back into the garage and frantically tries to pull helen away from her death grip on the door handle
the man begins stalking around the front of the car toward her
she grabs one of helens crutches and raises it up as if to hit him
as he steps back to the ax and tries to extract it from the hood she suddenly rushes at him and begins belaboring him with the crutch
he lifts an arm to fend off the blows while his other hand con tinues to tug at the ax handle
i cant move
raising both arms to protect himself the man is forced to give ground moving further back into the garage with joan continuing to batter at him
then in a sudden burst of rage he grabs hold of the crutch yanks it from her grasp and lunges at her
o man trouble rev
socorro exits her bedroom to the hall and heads down the the stairs to investigate the cause of dukes barking
socorro steps into the room
the door automatically closes behind her
duke in a frenzy leaps at her then runs toward the glass doors
he hurls himself at the glass then returns to socorro
thinking hes gone rabid she screams and tries to hide behind one of the weight racks
the above course of procedure continues with duke trying desperately to indicate his intentions chasing socorro around and over the press benches and exercise paraphernalia
helen screaming over the hooded man has joan up against the garage wall
one of his hands is on her throat and the other is held over her mouth
in the struggle she manages to sink her teeth into his hand
he pulls it free and hits her across the face
she reaches to a flower pot on a potting shelf and pole axes him on the top of the head
it staggers him briefly and enables her to move out of his grasp
she immediately grabs an iron rake from the garden rack and turns fiercely toward him
now standing vanquished breathing hard and apparently having had enough he begins to back away from her
when he reaches a safe distance he turns and moves quickly off disappearing into the dark
joan her garments soiled and disheveled from the pre vious scene comes from the vicinity of the front door closely followed by duke and harry why didnt you have the
damn dog with you thats what hes for
i told you he was in the house
what the hell good is that
you have to have him with you at all times
p man trouble rev
as they move into the living room helen wearing joans chenille robe her hair wildly askew can be seen in the kitchen area holding a bottle of liquor in one
hand and searching through a cupboard for a glass
i cant have him with me didnt i tell you right all the time hes killing from the start its my mucous membranes
very dangerous to fool around with people like red layls
no you didnt i said he was dangerous and you said he wasnt
yeah but thats before he tried to part your hair with an axe
i dont know if it was him
maybe it was this tree surgeon
she starts to move toward the bedroom and he stops her wait a minute
how tall was he
about six one
kind of ugly
helen now with a drink in her hand steps into view behind harry he was about your height
no he wasnt he was much taller
well lets not quibble for god sakes
the man is a complete maniac
to harry and excuse me for saying but this isnt a job for an amateur
but wait he couldnt be the same man who burglarized my apartment because thats before i came up here
p man trouble rev
forget about him
i know what im talking about
joan if you dont call the police im not staying here
she takes the drink out of helens hand and drains it while harry continues guy like red layls have hit men working for them that drive them around and do
their dirty work for them
gee whiz first it isnt red now it is red
i cant keep up with these sudden reversals
im calling a cab
on helen as she clumps away in the direction of the guest bedroom thru thru harry sits on chaise trying not to catch glimpses of joan who is changing her
clothes in the closet
the mood is more subdued
you know what i think
its more than one person
its not more than one person
im telling you who the hell it is
but i dont think red would have someone sing into my answering machine
p man trouble rev
joan sticks her head out door
it doesnt seem like something hed do
she steps out of the closet and comes toward the bedroom dressed in one of andys negligees
god what is this
i cant say anything to you anymore youre so darn touchy
you can mention anything you want honey
im just trying to keep you from turning up face down thats all
after a moment i mean i cant leave you up here alone now
she moves toward the bed aware of harry staring at her
its andys its very becoming on you
she sits down on the edge of the bed looking over at him
maybe i dont quite fill it out
yes you do
after a brief moment well
he remains seated looking at her
she reaches to the answering machine on the night stand disconnects it then once again looks over at him
p man trouble rev
he gets up and comes over to the bed and reaches a hand down to touch the side of her face
she looks up at him she takes his hand he sits down on the bed beside her and they begin to make love
harry stands watching joan
she pulls the mercedes half way out of the garage and stops the car to call out to him what are you going to do now
are you going to leave
yeah im going to skip down the hill take care of a few things pick up some clothes
could you be back for dinner around
she waves to him and pulls the rest of the way out of the garage revealing the ax handle still embedded in the front of the car its handle sharply
angled up from the hood like a soup ladle
man trouble rev
note harry steps toward the car
h let me pull that thing out of the hood for you
j later i dont have time right now
she blows him a kiss
then moves down the driveway toward the gates
he stands watching until her car disappears
then he moves to front door of the house and finds it locked
moving around to the side of the house he unbuckles his wrist watch and puts it in his pants pocket
then he steps up to the service porch door sees socorro inside putting clothes into a washer and raps on the glass panel
she smiles in recognition and opens the door for him hi
ella no esta aqui
i just want to look for my
indicating his wrist watch i think i left it
gesturing toward the living room in there
ah si es okay
she steps out of the way to let him in
harry searches through the file cabinet then moves over to the desk and as joan had done previously goes through the drawers
duke sits in the doorway watching him
he opens and inspects the contents of the same drawers and cupboards joan had searched
duke follows harrys every movement as he engages in a deft professional search of the bedroom
he goes through the bureau drawers the closet shelves a pair of suitcases then crosses to one of the two nightstands
finding nothing in the drawer he moves around to its mate on the other side of the bed
he opens the drawer glances inside and starts to close it when he sees a gift envelope with his name on it rests on a small wrapped box
he picks it up opens the envelope and takes out a plain white card with a handwritten message on it thank you for everything youve done for me harry and
mostly for being in my life
i love you joan
harry sits down on the bed feeling the utter deficiency of heart implicit in this act of treachery and deception
he stares blankly into space for a moment
then he puts the card back picks up the box and without removing it from the drawer gives it a little shake
adele stands playing a garden hose over the lawn
two pop eyed little dogs yap and mill about her legs
in the b
harrys van can be seen in the driveway and presently he appears from the side of the house carrying a suitcase and a few items of clothes
as he moves to the van and opens the door her attention is drawn to him harry
what the hell do you think youre doing
he sets the suitcase down lays the clothes over it and crosses the lawn to her i just got a phone call honey from a prominent entertainer up in vegas
a very well known singer
who is it paul anka
hes a rock star you probably wouldnt know the name
anyway i gotta run a couple a dogs up to him
you know its t minus zero and counting harry on this whole shitty deal
now iwo dont blow this way out of proportion
you think i want to do this
i need the extra cash right now believe me
if you leave im getting top lock to come over and change the front and back doors
look im only talking screaming at about a short period of the dogs time here
i mean it
you get in that van and im taking my building back and putting in a fingernail salon
come on now honey dont say things like that
he puts an arm around her giving her a perfunctory hug man trouble rev
lets not make a big issue out of it
kisses her on the cheek okay
without waiting for a response he moves back across the lawn toward the van and is stopped mid stride as a strong spray from the hose hits him squarely on
they are finishing dessert and coffee by candlelight
joans hands encircle harrys wrist with a new watch
seated at the dining table
he is deeply morose and makes a half hearted attempt to enthuse as she tries to secure the clasp
the empty box and the card rest on the table next to the watch he used to deceive his way into the house
its really very nice looking honey
do you like it
she finishes securing the watch
yeah its great and its something i really needed so
he leans over and kisses her on the cheek then picks up his fork and begins poking with disinterest at his food
joans eyes remain on him trying to divine his mood is anything wrong
she resumes eating
then desirous of drawing his atten tion she fixes her gaze on the table top and smiles pensively making the assumption that he is looking at her
when no response is forthcoming she attempts a verbal solicitation without looking up youre probably wondering why im smiling
he looks over at her what
i was just thinking that i find this moody side of you very attractive
oh uh huh
in fact if you want to know and i can see youre dying to
reaches over and caresses his back i completely adore you
well same here honey
why are you all wet
he lays his fork down and tries to make an awkward and difficult excursion into the truth you know there is something i feel i gotta say here joan thats
been preying on my mind
something i maybe shouldve handled a bit differently with you from the start about this particular situation im in
man trouble rev
well you recall i mentioned to you a while back that i was finished
socorro steps into view addressing joan with great excitement senora ven rapido
with a certain que estoy en las noticias relationship and i de la televicion
more or less am but
she motions joan to follow and disappears into the kitchen
joan and harry looking toward the television set
socorro stands next to the screen pointing at herself a small figure near the front door of andys house
in the f
a television reporter addresses the camera mira alli estoy
over the above regarding an earlier press release announcing mrs
ellermans intention to publish her book which purportedly contains several explosive details concerning redmon layls controversial business dealings
harry coughs loudly as moncrief appears standing outside a government office building encircled by a picket of microphones attached to a number of floating hands
layls lawyer laurence moncrief had this to say when asked if he was concerned about what might be revealed in the ellerman book man trouble rev
i have no knowledge whatsoever of mrs
ellermans so called book or her alleged disappearance which appears to have all the ear marks of a publicity stunt
to harry outraged can you believe this
she turns contemptuously back to the screen
the reporter now stands in the f
of a three story build ing
slightly out of focus but discernible over its entrance are the words monroe park center
recent reports of layls failing health were denied by his personal physician dr
when questioned in a phone interview he responded that the elusive billionaire
as the reporter continues joan moves closer to the tv
was recovering from quote nothing more than the treatment of an ordinary virus
she points to the sign over the buildings entrance do you see that
this seems to be another intriguing joan episode in the stormy monroe park
thats the career of andy ellerman name of the man who checked one time washington andy out of the hospital
playgirl and erstwhile companion to one of the harry countrys wealthiest im not sure that was the men
this is heidi guys name
robles reporting to you from monroe park center in san dimas
man trouble rev
yes it was
she looks quickly back to the screen a commercial comes on
what did she say
then to harry wheres san dimas
without waiting for his answer she strides across the room lets call the t
station and find out
this is not the way you want to go about this honey
as she moves out of view into the living room he turns to socorro tell her soco
she shouldnt mess with these people
joan comes out of the bedroom with her purse and jacket and with harry following crosses the living room will you just once take the benefit of my advice
man trouble rev
first you tell me i go around acting too timid
yeah but this is a whole different situation here
and now when i suddenly feel like i could save the pope in an earthquake you start trying to
this is not the pope were talking about here believe me
thats just a figure of speech
they disappear out the front door
joan comes out the front door harry moving along beside her as she moves crossing briskly toward the garage dammit joan these people are holding all the cards
theyll probably throw you into that bughouse with your sister
she begins moving a little less purposively than before you want to go there and call em a bunch of names throw a lot of accusations at them
they dont care
people with that kind of money behind them with their kind of connections they never go to jail you never see them behind bars
they stop in front of the garage where joans car is parked am i getting through to you
man trouble rev
though evidently very troubled she nevertheless goes into the garage opens the drivers door and gets into the car
to himself jesus christ
the mercedes moves along one of the surface streets with the ax handle still protruding from its hood
following on the car as it enters a ramp and pauses before merging into the dense traffic on the eastbound hollywood freeway
joan staring grimly out the windshield as she snails along in the right hand lane
harry begins shifting fitfully around grumbling this is just nuts what youre doing
will you stop trying to undermine me every inch of the way
gesturing out the window look at this goddamned traffic
anyway i didnt ask you to drag along with me
youre the one thats dragging along
gesturing at a semi in front of them go around the goddamned truck
man trouble rev
dont tell me what to do
okay just let me drive the goddamned car thats all i ask
why should i let you drive
ill tell you why because youre a terrible driver thats why
oh now all the ugly little truths are coming out
you operate this vehicle like it was a cane with a red tip painted on the end of it
dont talk to me harry
i mean it just dont say another word to me
he angrily folds his arms across his chest assuming a sullen silence for a moment
the traffic has come to a grid lock stop raising their anxiety levels i was doing just fine until you started in on me
gesturing at the ax driving around with a goddamned ax stuck in your car
and now look at me
ive got purpose tremors
he suddenly opens the door gets out and moves to the ax handle
joan watches as he makes several unsuccessful attempts to pull the ax out of the hood of the car
man trouble rev
he gives up and moves back to the passenger door passing a man in an adjacent car looking curiously from the ax handle to him is something the fuck bothering
he gets into the mercedes and slams the door
joan moves quickly through the parking lot and onto a walkway leading to the hospital entrance
harry trailing behind calls up to her can i at least offer some advice
just barge into the place honey and play the big hero
pauses for a response when he tells you your sisters not there whatre you going to do cry
she stops walking and as he moves up beside her looks defiantly at him okay
he takes her by the hand and leads the way over the grounds toward the rear quarters of the hospital
on harry and joan as he tries several locked doors before finding one that gives entrance into the hospital
man trouble rev
they step inside a narrow hallway leading to one of the main corridors of the hospital
as they edge past a laundry cart outside a utility room harry releases her hand
she moves ahead then experiencing a sudden loss of nerve stops and looks back to see harry rummaging through the dirty laundry
harry in a white doctors jacket with joan at his side move through a corridor
as she glances nervously about then at him this isnt going to work
you look like a busboy
they approach a nurses station and harry steps forward to address one of two nurses behind the counter excuse me nurse
on harry joan and nurse one
presently the nurse ges tures to a stairwell leading to the second floor
joan and harry move in the direction indicated
moving into the stairwell
picking up harry and joan moving down the above hallway looking at the room numbers i hope you know what youre doing
just do what i told you
they approach room
in the hallway outside the adjacent room an old man in a hospital gown is seated in a wheelchair
he wears a stingy brim hat on his head and reads a pamphlet entitled colostomy and you
man trouble rev
harry reaches to the door opens it ushers joan inside and is about to follow when doctor
just a minute please
approaching up the hallway
he takes a few steps towards her assuming his all purpose scowl whats the problem dear
were trying to contact doctor park just to be sure hes authorized you to examine mrs
ellerman because you know we have to follow certain
youre doing your job
trying to look around him where did your assistant
she had to step inside for a moment to relieve herself
joan is now wearing andys hospital gown while andy is hastily buttoning herself into joans blouse and if this little kinglet of corporate shit thinks he can get away with
this hes greatly mistaken
just wait til he hears what im going to come out with now
joan thrusts her skirt at andy put this on
remember when he passed me off as staff and i was put on official government payroll all through maui and the yucatan mission
no i dont
and hurry up will you
and as andy steps into the skirt joan takes over the uncompleted buttoning chores yes you do remember when i almost died of the vomito negro
well thats when he was doing all that illegal oil drilling off the mexican gulf
she turns to look critically at her face in the mirror have you got any lipstick
on harry and the nurse as before i assume youre a fairly recent associate of the doctors
thats very correct
what do you specialize in
id say female troubles mainly
oh so dr
park feels theres a gynecological involvement here
sometimes he does yes
a beat by the way did anyone ever tell you what attractive eyebrows you have
thrown oh well no they havent
her attention is diverted to a second nurse entering the wing calling out to her and making a summoning gesture excuse me a minute doctor
harry watches as she moves away and while the two nurses engage in an exchange some distance down the hall he steps back to the door opens it and sticks
his head inside of joan and andy the former whispering urgently in ref erence to the latters red hair what about her hair
now snoozing in the wheelchair
harrys hand moves into frame and deftly removes his hat
man trouble rev
of the second nurse on her way back to the main corridor while nurse one is returning to harry
as she comes up to him that was my superior
she tells me dr
park is in surgery and she suggests that you wait in the administrative lounge until we can get a hold of him
would that be alright
he moves to the door opens it blocking the nurses view into it with his body
looking frightened at her imminent abandonment
dont worry mrs
ellerman well be right back
andy wearing dark glasses and with her hair hidden up under the stingy brim hat steps out into the hallway
harry takes her by the arm and looks amiably toward the nurse
gesturing a direction that way doctor and thank you very much for your patience
dont mention it
the nurse watches briefly as they move away then extracting a key from her pocket she steps over to the door and locks it
harry outside the mercedes glancing around furtively while inside the car andy continues to perseverate about red layls as she struggles out of joans clothes and this man who wouldnt
know the truth if it came up and spit him in the eye is accusing me of lying
she hands him the skirt out through the window you know what that prick had his lawyer say to me
harry lays the skirt on the hood of the car and begins getting out of the doctors jacket
that i was a pretty grudge bearing little malcontent grasping at some splinter of celebrity for myself at his expense
can you believe that
she hands him out the blouse and he turns politely away from her semi nudity as he hands her the doctors jacket
here put this on
i mean the arrogance
getting into the jacket what did she say your name was
flirtatiously have you got a cigarette harry
he takes a pack of cigarettes and a lighter from his shirt pocket and hands them to her stay in the car
dont talk to anybody and ill be right back
he immediately moves off rolling joans clothes into a bundle and heading back to the hospital grounds
man trouble rev
harry hurrying across the grounds to the rear of the hospital
in the distant b
beyond him the continental can be seen pulling up and parking on a street bordering the hospital
moncrief carrying a briefcase and his chauffeur sturge get out and move onto a walkway leading to the hospital entrance harry rounds the corner of the hospital building and stops
two male hospital employees are smoking and conversing outside the door he had previously entered with joan
he turns and moves out of sight
joan in a state of extreme nervousness paces about the room
her perambulations bring her near the door to the hallway
she reaches to the doorknob tests it and finds she is locked in
a soft whistle comes from the vicinity of the windows behind her followed by harrys voice whispering joan
are you there
she crosses quickly to the windows looking out through the thick wire mesh at harry he stands several feet below looking up at the window
is that you
yes its me
hurry up will you
im having a little trouble getting back in
oh great harry
what have you got me into
dont worry honey
you have to get me out of here
everythings under control just hang on a few more minutes and ill be right back okay
as he moves out of sight her attention is drawn to the sound of muffled voices in the hallway
in a panic she starts toward the bathroom changes her mind moves to the bed and gets into it
as the door begins to open she grabs one of the pillows and quickly covers her head with it
being let into the room by a male nurse
he closes the door after them and the two men look toward the bed andy
its larry moncrief
of the unresponsive figure under the covers
would you care to sit up for a minute
id like to talk to you
on andy in the drivers seat of the mercedes
the window is rolled up and she puffs impatiently on a cigarette
presently she catches sight of something out the drivers window and turns to look man trouble rev
a sleek black car with opaqued windows pulls into a parking slot several yards away
a faded male beauty somewhere in his s gets out of the rear passenger door and as he moves to the walkway leading to the hospital grounds she quickly rolls
down the window and angrily addresses him you son of a bitch
red layls looks toward the mercedes and as he approaches we can see a medical beeper attached to his belt
her hair still hidden under the stingy brim her eyes unrecognizable behind the dark glasses
he comes up to the car peering closely at its occupant who is it
who the hell do you think it is
is that you
she pulls the dark glasses off
no thanks to you its me
and throws them onto the dashboard
harry hastens back along the walkway to the parking lot
once again he halts abruptly in his tracks aw jesus
man trouble rev
opening the drivers door and reaching in to take hold of andys arm
as she steps out of the car we see that below the doctors jacket harry had intended to retrieve she is bare legged and wears joans high heels
harry turns and strides back toward the hospital
moncrief places a briefcase on a nightstand next to the bed
as he opens it and searches through its contents before he arrives id like you to take a look at a list of certain deletions and expurgations which if agreed
he removes several typed pages stapled together and looks down at the pillow covering joans face red is very generously i think prepared to offer his sanction to a sanitized
version of your book
moncrief glances over at sturge standing near the door then back at the figure on the bed
i think you should know that if you push this too far you run the risk of having him withdraw his consent to your well being
pauses then i dont think we want that do we andy
he reaches down and removes the pillow
joan looks fear fully up at him andys not here
i can see that miss spruance
would you care to tell me where she is
man trouble rev
she sits up glancing uneasily at sturge then attempts to assert herself boldly to moncrief as a matter of fact she happens to be on her way to the police
right now accompanied by a close friend of mine
her bluff is immediately belied by honey
its me again
moncrief and joan look toward the window i have to tell you something
joan jumps from the bed and moves to address harry dont say a word harry
im not alone
moncrief looks at the chauffeur gesturing toward the door
sturge exits to the hallway leaving the door open
standing below the window whispering whos there
moncrief steps in beside joan i think you better come in here mr
muttering under his breath man trouble rev
in the distant b
the previously seen old man is being wheeled along the main walkway by a hospital orderly
just go get andy and leave will you
thats what im trying to tell you
im a little disappointed to find you defaulting on our agreement
joan looks from moncrief to harry what agreement
to moncrief bullshit
i never agreed to anything
to joan this asshole approached me and tried to bribe me into working for them and i told him to go to hell
i believe an agreement was implicit in your acceptance of my check
oh you want to see your check
he begins searching frantically through his pockets man trouble rev
oh harry how could you
honey dont go by anything this guy says because im the only one who knows what the hell im doing
pulls the envelope from his back pocket it just slipped my mind i was going to tell you
holds it up see
i never cashed the fucking thing
he tears the envelope in half and as he throws it on the ground a hand the size of a large dictionary reaches into frame and grabs him roughly by
the back of his shirt collar
lurching about in a grapplers waltz below the window
in the b
the old man can be seen leaning down to the walkway picking up the stingy brim hat and returning it to his head
she turns from the window to see a subdued andy entering her eyes showing signs of recent weeping
behind her in the hall moncrief can be seen greeting red layls
joan moves over to her
are you alright
and in response to andys stoical nod no youre not
embracing her what did that bastard do to you
i need a kleenex
she moves toward the nightstand with joan following man trouble rev
you know what theyre trying to do dont you
to force you into signing some kind of agreement that
wait i want to tell you what he said to me
she extracts a tissue from a dispenser on the nightstand he said i was the only woman hes ever really cared for
and when he said it
blowing her nose he had a tear in his eye
joans jaw goes slack in disbelief
glancing sourly at the two women as he and moncrief enter
well this moves to the top of the list red as one of your more stunning achievements
irritably get me something cold to drink will you
speaking in hushed and in joans case urgent tones while in the b
moncrief exits to the hallway
andy you dont know what youre saying
youre suffering from hostage syndrome or something
well after all i do love him
you love him
yes hes been a very important man in my life you know that
raising her voice oh now hes not a fecal faced great white shark
andy looks over at red now seated in one of the two chairs in the room
moncrief can be seen re entering and joining him
i dont know where she got that
back to joan will you please keep your voice down
hes very sensitive to what people say
have you lost all your beads
this man had you kidnapped and kept in a drugged stupor for the last three weeks and now hes
stepping into the doorway holding struge in a painful armlock alright what the hells going on in here
thats the dog trainer
i thought he was working for us
man trouble rev
well there seems to be a little grey area there red
to harry come over here i want to talk to you
harry releases sturge and moves over to layls offering his hand and trying to maintain his gruff manner mr
joan looks with dismay at harrys apostasy as he shakes the great mans hand then quickly returns her atten tion to andy will you listen to me
this man is not only a bastard hes a scummy soul less little thug and a criminal
are you implying that i have defective judgement in men joanie
red and harry as before
in the b
a hospital employee wheels a cart holding several glasses of iced tea
moncrief moves over to the cart and the employee exits
i just want a say that though youre someone in a category i admire youve gone to some lengths on this thing here that i dont entirely agree with
i have a neck condition and it aggravates me to have to look up at you
as he seats himself in the other chair red reaches up and takes a glass of tea offered by moncrief but i want to go on and finish my thought
on this because
man trouble rev
you know im not in the best of health right now and ive been advised to avoid excitement
harry takes a second glass from moncrief so if you intend to do that
after a sip of tea i might just have to have my shock troops blow your brains out
oh uh huh
holds the glass up to moncrief more sugar
and furthermore this sensitive mans lawyer more than implied they were willing to put your feet as well as probably mine into a block of cement
oh thats just all talk
calling over to moncrief would somebody please get me my clothes
in the b
sturge exits on another flunky errand
just put yourself harry for a moment in the shoes of a man whose sole intention is to leave the world a better place than he found it only to
discover those intentions have been painfully slandered by someone hed given both his heart and his economic support to not to mention his trust
man trouble rev
nodding his head uhm hmm
looking over at harry protesting loudly harry i cant believe youre sitting there nodding your head and having a tea party with these crooks
im not nodding my head honey im just listening to the man
as harry in the b
resumes his exchange with red who is this guy anyway
isnt he a little sleazy joanie a bit infra dig
i mean lewies a bit of a stiff but
youre going to talk to me about sleaze when you consorted with some maniac tree surgeon who was flicking his tongue out at me like some rutting iguana and groping
at his naturalia at three in the morning
she looks to the chauffeur re entering with her clothes
he came at me with an ax
well hes very immature
before joan can respond she crosses to take her belongings from sturge and as she moves toward the bathroom man trouble rev
of the beleaguered maiden she hoped to rescue pausing on her way to lean down and kiss the cheek of the dragon she meant to slay
as moncrief steps up to her offering a glass of tea miss spruance would you care for a
no thank you
she moves past him striding over to harry and red excuse me
raising a baleful eye to joan i dont know what kind of spell youve cast on my sister but it doesnt extend to me
standing above layls in fact ive been to the police and i intend to press charges against you
honey hes not supposed to get excited
overlapping him not only for having my apartment burglarized but for breaking into andys house as well as hiring someone to frighten harass and intimidate me
man trouble rev
you know maybe you better not
hes got a bad neck
im not afraid of these snakes
she looks defiantly from harry to moncrief then back to red who regards her coldly for a moment then i never much cared for you young lady
and i find your display of anger both unattractive and unfeminine
to red now wait a minute
overlapping im not here to beg your good opinion
under the following reds beeper begins signaling red layls or not you
or to find out dont insult this party in the right amount of my presence
attractiveness and likability im supposed to render up
without removing his eyes from joans he raises the beeper to his mouth and presses the speaker button what is it
doctor park is trying to reach you
tell him to hold on
then to joan first you assume far more interest in you on my part than exists
i had nothing whatsoever to do with your supposed misfortunes
man trouble rev
very emphatic i dont believe you
and as regards andys house id have no need to break into andys house because i own andys house
i dont care whose house you own youre nothing but a slimy mean minded little hood
partially dressed stepping into the doorway and combing her hair as she addresses joan will you please stop interfering in my personal life joanie
red lifts the beeper to his mouth again go ahead
i just want to go out to the yacht and get a park v
little color back for red
ive got good news
weve found one for you
andy you know something
as she moves over to andy red gets up paces around with the beeper and his and parks voices are muffled in b
the kind of woman you are is a danger to the kind of woman i am so the next time you and your boyfriend have a domestic spat dont call
well if youre going to take this kind of grumpy attitude i certainly wont
and as she goes back into the bathroom joan turns to harry
harry where are my clothes
he stands up and red steps into frame beside him a distressed look on his face as he listens to park v
i think they must be im over at poly outside
how soon can you get over here
will you go get them red v
please id like to leave
wait a minute dont rush me on this monroe
harry moves around red and steps up to joan can i just talk to you for im not rushing you one minute first
but we dont have the luxury of waiting too joan long either
theres nothing for you to say harry its very clear red v
what your priorities are
well i want a hell of a lot more information harry before you start honey all ive been trying carving me up
to do from day one is look out for you
pauses i can tell you this dont you believe that
much red ive taken a look at it and im very excited
no i dont
will you people be quiet i cant hear this
to the beeper go ahead
joan and harry are forced to listen to the following exchange its as sound a muscular bag as ive ever seen and the pericordium is a gorgeous color
man trouble rev
well whose heart is it
give me a profile
i dont have any specific data but the host was around and she was obviously very healthy
he begins pacing anxiously again the camera following him i told you i dont want a womans heart
dont worry its not going to change you in any way
how do you know
you dont know that
look lets just get it done
as red paces toward the open bathroom door harry and joan resume their discord in other words you dont and later if you find trust me
youre unsatisfied with it we can always get you another one
would you please get me my clothes
moncrief steps in beside joan i wanted to tell you a moment ago that i was privileged to see you at the bowl on the fourth of july
im talking to this lady
man trouble rev
andy pauses in her application of mascara shifting her gaze to reds reflection in the mirror as he enters behind her you cant tell me what kind of a woman
and if she was so godammed healthy why is she dead
on moncrief joan and harry
and i was especially moved by your rendition of the battle hymn of the
harry suddenly grabs moncrief roughly by the arm never mind that shit
he shakes him causing him to spill his iced tea onto the front of his jacket did i spend your money
did i give you any services for it
tell this woman the truth you son of a bitch
harry releases him and under the following moncrief takes out a handkerchief and dabs at his jacket well shall we start with the fact that youre a married man
looking at harry and then go on from there
devastated as she looks at harry
over the above jesus christ
what are you trying to do to me
man trouble rev
she turns away from him and goes toward the bathroom
wait a minute honey
as she disappears inside red re enters and covering the speaker vents on the beeper strides over to moncrief you know whose heart this body snatcher is trying to give
a victim of somebody called the westside slasher
and this is the doctor you recommended to me
into the beeper youre killing me monroe
you know that
youre pushing me to the goddamned wall
joan comes out of the bathroom with the doctors jacket and moves immediately to the hallway door and exits
joan moves quickly down the hall putting the doctors jacket on over her hospital smock with harry following trying desperately to explain honey theres a simple explanation to all of
this if you want me to go into it
i was trying to tell you at dinner
she disappears into an intersecting hallway
will you just stop for one minute and let me talk to you
its very complicated
he disappears into the same hallway
red slumped in a chair and looking in desperation to andy who enters now fully dressed and looking as glamorous as a movie star what in the hell should i
man trouble rev
coming over to him well red better a woman than dead dont you think
she reaches down and proprietarily brushes the scarf from his shoulders
so lets just go there sweetheart and have him sew the darn thing in
joan sits in dejected silence refusing to look at harry look you know you live a life honey you make some mistakes
you get married for maybe mutual benefits or business considerations weighing on you at the time and because you dont think the right person is ever going to come along
i would never have knowingly become involved with a married man
i know that thats why i was trying to come out and tell you
please i dont want to discuss it anymore
after a brief silence i bet you never read dante either
now there youre percent wrong
i mean i cant believe it that youd lie to me about this
okay i lied
didnt you ever tell a lie
if not let me kiss your high heel
im going in the house
man trouble rev
can i call you tomorrow just to see how youre feeling
or how things are going
i have a dress rehearsal tomorrow and a concert on friday
thats all i care about right now
she reaches to the door handle then very emotionally and i dont want to see you anymore
dont say that please
im asking you to just give me the chance to clear up all these things in my life because
i didnt extricate myself from the infidelities of one man just to fall into the arms of the prince of prevaricators
well i may be all kinds of a son of a bitch and the prince of whatever but that doesnt mean i wouldnt when it comes down to it stand
up and take the bullet for you
she finally looks over at him her eyes brimming with tears thats not what i observed harry
she opens the door and gets out
as joan crosses the driveway to the house moves up the steps to the front door and disappears inside
he remains seated for a moment glancing briefly down at the watch on his wrist
then his eyes raise expectantly as comes out the door and lopes across the driveway toward the mercedes
harry lays a hand on dukes head half heartedly acknow ledging the dogs devoted greeting then he moves with him toward the van
on his way he glances somberly over his shoulder at the house
in so doing his gaze falls on the ax embedded in the hood of the mercedes
he stops and walks back to the car
once again he takes hold of the ax handle and makes several attempts to dislodge it
in a final arthurian effort the blade yields and he pulls the ax free
he suddenly steps back away from the car as a steamy spray of hot radiator water spurts up from the gash in the top of the hood
then he glances guiltily toward the house and moves to his van with duke following
harry his suitcase and clothes in the front seat and duke in bed of the van parks in front of the house of bliss in the plate glass window
harry knocks on the door of the apartment waits for a response and getting none steps over to one of the windows and looks inside harry i want my dog
he turns around to see his ex partner lee macgreevy standing on the pathway
man trouble rev
hey lee how are you
moves toward him i just this minute got back from vegas
i was dealing a couple of dogs to paul anka
shakes his hand i was about to give you a call
dont embarrass us both man
just give me the dog back and lets preserve the friendship
as they move over to lees van lee im in the neighborhood of getting my hands on the money
im about to close a business deal with vark zulethian of zulethian carpets youve probably heard of him
come on i know these dodges backwards and forwards
i need the dog
hes up for a tv series
they stop beside the van
harry glances at the printing on the side panel lee macgreevy trainer of duke the worlds smartest dog
over the above i dont even want the ten thousand now compared to what he might appreciate to
as lee opens his van and takes out a leash
look our agreement was i could buy the dog back
hes the only thing i got to prove to people what i can do and all im asking you lee is
man trouble rev
dont make me have to get legal with you harry
you sold me the animal then as a personal favor i let you borrow him to demo to some v
that probably dont even exist
you havent been straight with me man
hands him the leash just go get the dog
as they come across the parking lot to lees van
harry hands him the leash and lee addresses duke get in
he ignores the command and looks at harry duke geh im wagen
duke jumps into the back of the van
inside is a large wire travel kennel with another german shepherd inside
lee removes the leash from duke and gestures at the other dog why dont you take this dog harry
hes green but maybe you could do something with him
he opens the cage and clips the leash to the dogs collar
no i dont want the dog
the shepherd jumps out to the ground wagging his tail giving him the leash go ahead man
if you dont want him pick up some change
closing the van sell him for a pet
as lee starts to walk past him harry detains him indi cating the words on the side panel of the van man trouble rev
do me one favor will you
say owner if you want to but dont say trainer
i trained that dog
claps him on the shoulder let me think about that okay
he moves past him and out of frame
harry watching lees van pull away
in the rear window dukes face can be seen looking back at him
harry in a profound state of bereavement as vita fills a coffee cup in front of him what do you want harry
without responding he looks across to the house of bliss
you want the meatloaf special
he looks up at her unable to answer
chicken pot pie
do you want anything
he finally answers but from some place deeply felt and unrelated to the days specials yeah
equally bereaved in front of a full length mirror while a seamstress makes some adjustments on her gown
man trouble rev
in the b
members of the chorale can be seen milling about and conversing at the close of the dress rehearsal
helen now free of her crutches and holding a gown over her arm moves into view addressing her a few of us are going to grab a bite
you want to join us
no go ahead
im not hungry
well whos going to drive you home
ill call a cab
eddy steps into frame i can take her home
good because i dont want you to be alone
blows her a kiss see you tomorrow
she moves away and joan returns her attention to the mirror then thank you eddy
harry stands in the vicinity of the fountains
his attention on the facade of the chandler pavilion where a contingent of the chorale can be seen exiting out through the glass doors in various groupings
searching for joan
following the last grouping joan carrying a garment bag and eddy revere exit and move in the direction of the other chorale members crossing the plaza to the stairway leading
down to the surface parking lots
man trouble rev
as he restrains the impulse to follow then does so
on eddys jeep as it moves through one of the seedier sections of the city
joan stares sadly out the window
then i hate living here now
a pause id like to move to a small town where its friendly and everybody knows each other and there are no bars on the windows
and the milkmans a child molester
he laughs then well its true
it doesnt matter where you live
are you in a bad mood or something
im not in a bad mood
not as bad as yours
after a moment he begins softly singing the words to a popular song
thru thru the van moves through the same city streets as above
man trouble rev
a sports car is in between the van and eddys jeep
from the higher vantage point of the van he has a clear view through the rear window of eddys jeep and just before it makes a right hand turn onto
a northbound street joan can be seen leaning over to eddy placing her face close to his
stunned and disturbed by the implications of what hes seen
joan singing the same song as above her head inclined toward eddys harmonizing her voice with his as the jeep turns onto a street leading up into the hollywood hills
further up the winding road a car passes him obscuring his view of eddys jeep
eddy and joan are now midway above the city
they drive in silence for a while then he begins what seems to be a casual reminiscence
remember when we were on tour in japan in
she looks over at him
the night after we did a concert in osaka
could you be more specific
man trouble rev
we had a few drinks in your room
and a certain intimacy took place
she appears uncertain that she shares the same memory
and when i asked to see you the next night you know what you said
you were too tired and sleepy
that was witty of me
but you werent
because an hour later you went into lewies room and you didnt come out
well if you remember i was in love with lewis around that time which i confided to you so you did know
thats not the reason
excuse me eddy you just passed the turn off to my street
i just want to drive a little so we can talk
she sighs impatiently then anyway if i remember correctly we only kissed
but if that led you to believe something that hurt you in any way i apologize
he reaches up to adjust the rearview mirror inadver tently drawing her atttention to his hand
man trouble rev
between the thumb and the forefinger is imprinted with a crescent shaped series of indentations
what happened to your hand
it looks like somebody bit you
he returns his hand to the steering wheel
she looks at him with a slight smile waiting for him to elaborate then well am i supposed to guess or are you going to
she breaks off suddenly aware that the teeth marks are her own oh eddy
the jeep pulls off mulholland and onto a dirt road lifting a haze of dust into the cars headlights appear ing and disappearing in the switchbacks harrys van can be
the jeep continues on the winding road nearing a promontory high above the city
thru thru the van tries to negotiate without the benefit of four wheel drive up a steep and rutty incline
man trouble rev
the van bounces and skids
the green shepherd in the bed of the van pants nervously looking at harry struggling with the steering wheel
the jeep pitches about on its shocks as it moves up an incline graded slightly higher than the one already giving harry trouble
eddy shifts into four wheel
joan jostled about by the uneven surface beneath them looks over at him why did you do these things
because you deserved it
i didnt deserve it
ive always thought of you and treated you as one of my closest and dearest friends
i use to think very highly of you too but now i dont like what i see
in fact its been very disturbing to me joan
pauses then very disillusioning
to see that before youve even gotten rid of lewie youve started up with some other man
eddy i want you to take me home now
the wheels of the van loose traction
harry gets out and looks up toward the taillights of eddys jeep disap pearing in the hazy distance
he looks for a rock and finding one large enough wedges it under one of the rear tires
then he quickly gets back into the van
spinning to no effect and sending up a jet of dust
man trouble rev
the jeep pulls onto a large dirt promontory situated above the city and makes a sharp angle bringing it to the edge of the brush and chaparral sloping down into
eddy and joan
under the following his hand reaches down to something lying out of sight to the left of the drivers seat you know theres so many things about me you have
no idea of
you never ask me about my life or what im thinking because you have no interest
yes i do
you can tell me whatever you want to but lets go back down to
she breaks off as she catches sight of a knife held in his left hand
creative things and dreams and feelings i have that lewie or anyone else in your life are not capable of
she suddenly reaches frantically to the door handle and tries to get out
he grabs hold of her arm and pulls her back into the seat see
youre not genuinely interested
youre not at all sincere joan
you present yourself like you are but youre not
moves his face closer to hers dont you think i know that better than anybody
he takes her arm and places it around his neck
man trouble rev
what are you doing
i want you to listen to me and i want you to kiss me
and this time like you mean it
he brings his mouth close to hers
the drivers door suddenly opens and harry in the heat and fury of his jealousy instantly begins berating her okay what is this
what the hell are you doing with this guy
he reaches in and pulls eddy away from joan
harry look out
the warning is simultaneous with an attempt by eddy to stab him with the knife
he grabs eddys arm and in hauling him out of the car rips loose the sleeve of eddys shirt
eddy and harry the latter finding himself engaged in a violent scuffle with a man larger than himself and possessed of the prodigious strength of the psychotic
joan hurries around the car
harry his cheek cut is trying to force the knife out of eddys hand
she looks toward harrys van parked several yards behind eddys car and immediately runs over to it
she pulls open the door and addressing the dog inside points toward harry and eddy duke fasse
man trouble rev
the shepherd jumps out of the car runs past her to the nearest bush and lifts his leg on it
she runs back to the two men and hurls herself at them causing all three of them to land in the brush on an incline at the side of road
a frantic free for all takes place on the precarious footing of the hillside with joan alternately pulling at one and pushing at the other
the intensity and violence of their struggle is such that she is knocked further down the incline
harry quickly glances down the hill to see if she is alright and is left open to severe blow by eddy who breaks free and runs to his car
harry pursues him catching him as he tries to get into the car
he pushes him against the door and they begin battering each other with a series of punches
the shepherd wanting to join in the excitement leaps about them barking joyously
then finding eddys sleeve he takes it in his mouth and begins shaking it vigorously
joan her hair fretted with twigs climbs up over the edge of the hill
in the b
behind her a helicopter approaches
she looks toward harry and eddy trading blows then climbs up the rest of the way and as she gets to her feet she picks up a stone and throws
it at them yelling you bastards
the search beam of the copter spotlights joan
she is bent over picking up sticks and stones and as if routing a deadly enemy she begins hurling them as well as a series of invectives at the lights
of the city below her words barely audible over the sound of the rotors
the beam sweeps from her to pick up harry and eddy and an amplified god like voice comes from above from above what are you people doing down there
joan turns back to harry
he holds the now unconscious eddy by his shirt front and resuming his accusations starts to move toward joan are you crazy
what are you doing running around with a guy like this
she raises her arm ready to hurl the last stone you maniacs
what are you yelling at me for
this son of a bitch is probably the westside slasher
of the circling helicopter a man holding onto a life less body seems to be stalking toward a woman in a defensive stance standing on the edge of the hill
with a stone in her hand
it looks like a domestic quarrel
lets get a car up here quick
she is yelling at him im finished wagging my tail and leaving little puddles on the floor
wait a minute honey
and smiling on command because i dont give a damn whether any of you like me or not
from above are you alright maam
yelling up at the copter yeah shes alright
ive got him
gesturing at eddy the westside slasher i got him
hes not the westside slasher
from above hes a friend of mine
just stand where you are buddy
a friend of yours
this guys a friend of yours
none of you are friends of mine you fucker
from above maam is this guy bothering you
they both yell up into the blinding light of the search beam will you shut up
im not bothering her godammit i love her
harry lets go of eddy and leans down to pick up the knife gesturing it at the helicopter look you assholes
the guy was holding a knife at her throat
from above okay put the knife down fellow
then to joan again taking a step toward her what were you doing kissing this guy
i wasnt kissing him
from above stand where you are and put down the knife
perceiving the danger to harry put the knife down harry
man trouble rev
to the copter why dont you go harass someone else
from above weve got a bead on you so just put it down
terrified that they are going to shoot him she moves over to harry from above stay where you are dont go near him
to the copter i just saved her life you son of bitches
give me that thing
she grabs the knife out of his hand throws it away then places her arms around him desperately pantomiming to the helicopter see
hes not hurting me
hes my friend
then to harry this is just for their benefit
from above dont touch her buddy
but thats what i am honey your friend thats what i wanted to tell you and then i saw you with this guy
from above dont worry lady weve got a car on the way
up into the light will you please shut up and go away
this is private
cant you see that
i just wanted to tell you because you dont know how important you are to me
from above step away from him maam
she waves the voice off trying to listen to harry
and i needed you to know this one other thing about me because i dont want to withhold anything from you anymore
oh god i dont want to know harry
what is it
my real names not harry
profoundly relieved oh
saying it lovingly eugene
i love that name
eugene puts his arms around her
the et ressurexit from bachs b minor mass begins over the sound of the the camera moves to a remote angle revealing them bathed in a celestial cone of light
from above making intimately emotional declarations and explanations to one another
conducting the full chorus soloists and orchestra in the above music
the camera searches out some familiar faces and finds socorro and her son in law balto
in the row behind them detective melveny and a few seats to the side of him vita the waitress
restively fanning herself with a programme seated in an aisle seat next to moncrief
music over lee macgreevy opens the enclosure puts duke inside and moves out of frame
duke paces unhappily back and forth
music over shadows from a barred window are cast onto the wall behind butch gable and eddy revere who sit sulky and disinterested in the mfccs cheerful therapy hour rap
music over duke makes a run from the far end of enclosure and vaults into the air sailing over the top of the fence
music over red layls lies with a plastic tube up his nose
his hospital gown is open and his chest area is laced up like a football
through half closed eyes he watches the cardiograph line hooked up to his heart dance in tempo to the music
music over duke looking like he knows what hes doing and where hes going runs through the night
dressed in leather on the back of a motorcycle her arms around the helmeted young man moving in a counter direction to duke
music over adele in her shorts and halter top attends the barbecue a spatula in her hand
as though someone had just addressed her by her rightful name she suddenly turns to look in the camera and happy to be noticed she lays the spatula down and
begins to do a hula dance
music over duke running through the night
music over sturge leans with his back against the continental
across from him is eugenes van and in through the window the green shepherd looks back at him with one of eugenes socks dangling from his mouth
music over duke running across an intersection
music over sturge lights a cigarette then raises his eyes to see duke leaping up onto the hood of eugenes van
he lies down and lowers his head to rest on his paws
then look ing across at sturge he raises his lips in a soundless disdainful growl
her eye catches eugene arriving late
he moves down the aisle searching for a seat
he has forgotten to remove the training leash from his belt loop and the tip of it hangs an inch or so below the hem of his sport jacket
finding an empty seat he edges in past a couple on the aisle and seats himself
soloists and orchestra
searching for him again and finding him she smiles
he returns her smile
his eyes shine and glisten with emotion and an expression of undissembled and openly childlike delight takes shape upon his face
the screen goes black
