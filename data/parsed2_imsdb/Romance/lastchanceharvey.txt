written by joel hopkins sound of a piano being played
sparse but beautiful
harvey shine mid s sits at a piano in a scruffy recording room tinkering
we hold on his slightly sad intense gaze
just then a shaft of crude light illuminates him accompanied by a knocking sound
from behind a studio window johnnie a young rocker type in his s beckons
harvey closes the piano lid
johnnie unpacking his lunch and turning on various buttons sits at a mixing desk
in front of him are large tv monitors
harvey joins him
put my score up first
they dont want to hear it harvey
i know but i want to hear it
put it up
im backed up already harvey
interrupting johnnie you were the one that was late
just put it up
johnnie reluctantly presses various buttons
a cheesy commercial for a washing detergent plays
it is accompanied by a jolly classical score
harvey looks on forlornly at his work
as it comes to an end with a flourish harvey lowers his head
johnnie glances at him
marvin wants me to present my ideas while your away
harvey looks up confused
look im not doing myself any favours here harvey
but id watch your back
we hold on harveys tired pensive face
harvey hurriedly exits the studio catching up with a man walking to his car
shouldnt you be in london
yeah im heading there now
whats going on
johnnie said something about you wanting him to present on monday
oh yeah no i was just thinking that what with you being in london you should stay a while
theres no need to rush back
enjoy your daughters wedding
well johnnie can do it
i mean he can pitch the samuelson account
no im coming back
those are my connections
they have been for years
i know but
theyve got new people running things over there
i think theyre after something
i want to come back
i should be there in person
there in person
harvey nobody cares
i have to stand behind my music
theyre already pressed
no one needs to be there
theyre not looking for you theyre not looking for me
they just need a fucking track
beat sighs harvey you havent booked a top line in months
you got me doing triangle chimes for christs sake give me something to compose
thats what im trying to tell you
its not about composition
its different now
harvey looks at marvin
im back on monday marvin
im coming back
sighs you got to land this one harvey
what are you saying
beat say it
im saying there are no more chances harvey
beat enjoy london
and with that marvin gets in and drives off leaving harvey standing alone in the car park
we hold on his face hes tired
he looks about him then down at his raincoat draped over his arm
he lifts it and drapes it over the other arm
sound of interior airborne plane
the seat belt ping chimes
harvey seated in a crowded economy cabin looks down from the now extinguished seat belt light
he looks a little hot
reaching up to turn on the air he knocks his tray knocking his drink into his lap
an attractive middle aged woman seated next to him looks over
to a passing stewardess miss
ive spilt my drink
ill get you some napkins
to his neighbour whys it always me
the woman perhaps wary of the length of the flight smiles noncommittally
the stewardess returns
shall i take that
and could i get another
a whiskey wasnt it
jamesons no ice
the stewardess heads off
harvey mops himself up
he places the small mass of wet towels on his tray and sighs
glancing out the window he then turns to the woman
the woman looks over
feeling obliged yourself
my daughters getting married
smiles thank you
beat shes marrying an american
but for some reason weve all got to go over to london
smiling i told her we had a perfectly good wedding system here
beat expecting more of a response they both work there you see
the woman smiles again then looks up as the stewardess returns with harveys drink
harvey is about to continue speaking when the woman interrupts
im really sorry but i have a meeting in the morning and i must try and get some sleep
its just ill be useless unless i get some sleep
the woman covers herself in a blanket and turns out her light turning herself away from harvey
we hold on harvey from a distance spotlit in a sea of darkness
sound of a commercial london radio station
a phone in competition takes place
a radio hangs from a mail trolley
kate mid s dressed in a green uniform turns into the path of a suburban house
she passes a postman who nods his head
looking lovely as ever
if i was younger
pointing to her cheek blushing
is she up
kate smiles before unlocking the front door
kate comes through the door picking up a small pile of mail off the floor
calling out mum
its me your daughter
kate puts the mail on a kitchen table
just then maggie kates mum enters in her dressing gown
hello my daughter
have a cup of tea with me
i cant im running late
maggie seems to ignore this piece of information and heads to the kettle
filling it up she peers out the back window
hes at it again
looking through her bag who
barbecuing or something
we see her pov of her neighbour busying himself in his back garden
smoke rises from a small garden shed
i heard hes from poland
pulling a small package from her bag so maybe polish people like to barbecue a lot
im leaving your prescription on the table
beat you know you dont have to keep taking these the doctor said
i like to
it makes me feel better
beat its oclock in the morning
who barbecues at
looking at her watch ive got to go
ill call you later
kates mum sighs and turns away from the window
dont worry about me
ill be ok
beat have you got that date thing tonight
i dont know maybe
kisses her mother bye mum
time and tide kate as your father liked to say
was that from his terrace in the south of france
kates mum looks hurt
that was mean
beat takes a breath
look ill call you later
kisses her mum again i love you
as kate leaves maggie watches her go
she sighs before returning her attention back to the window
pov the neighbour enters his smoking shed and closes the door
a busy high st
kate moves amongst the throng boarding a bus
close up on kates face gently swaying
she stands reading a paperback oblivious to the crowded bus around her
kate sits reading on a speeding train
the heathrow express comes into the station
kate arrives at a booth
a sign reads psa public statistics agency
a west indian woman dressed in the same green uniform stands waiting
she holds a newspaper folded open at the crossword
kate goes behind the counter and turns on a light
as the booth illuminates kate unlocks a door behind and goes in
without looking up from her crossword aggie follows
kate places her bag in a locker and takes out a pair of heels
sitting down to put them on aggie enters
a filmy layer on the surface of a liquid
kate thinks for a beat
aggie giggles to herself and writes it in
kate stands just as another co worker hurries in
she kisses kate on the cheek and opens her locker
thank god youre my boss
without looking up aggie tuts and shakes her head
oonagh decides to ignore
are we still on for tonight
matts definitely bringing simon
only if you guys swear you wont leave if its not going well
another word for souvenir
kate thinks for a beat
aggie laughs and scribbles it in
oonagh rolls her eyes
aggie why do you bother
you just get kate to give you all the answers
aggie tuts again and waves oonagh away
kate hands oonagh a clip board and the two of them head out
as luggage spews out a dishevelled harvey looks on
he sees his case and awkwardly pulling it from the belt heads off
oonagh and kate stand next to each other interviewing returning travellers
kate interviews an elderly couple
its clear shes good at her job
so you spent the whole weeks in the toronto area
our daughter lives there see
filling in a form so not a business trip then
unless you count grand children as work
smiles some might
harvey comes through a set of sliding double doors wheeling his case behind him
kate finishes up the interview with the elderly couple and turns to see an approaching harvey in the distance
she registers his attempts to steer a wide berth of her but matches his movements bringing him to a stop
sorry i couldnt just ask you a few very quick questions could i
im sorry but im in a bit of a hurry
it wont take a moment
starting to walk on look im sorry but im tired you know
kates directness brings harvey to a stop
he turns to look at kate
harvey continues on glancing back once more as he walks away
kate turns to oonagh and shrugs before returning her attention back to the sea of arrivals
a taxi pulls away from the terminal
harvey sits in the back with his phone to his ear
hi suzie its your dad
ive made it in one piece
im in a taxi on my way to the hotel
i guess ill see you all there
harvey hangs up
he dials another number
hi its harvey harvey shine here
just wanted to confirm mike for monday
im in london at the moment but reachable on my cell
well youve probably got it on file but just in case
well you may have to dial an international code first im not sure
a sharp beep cuts him off
harvey hangs up and looks out the window
cranes loom on the horizon
the taxi pulls into the forecourt of a mid market west end london hotel
harvey gets out and pays the driver
harvey approaches the front desk
im with the wedding party
there should be a room for me
the concierge taps into his computer
i have a double room for you
has everyone else checked in
im not sure sir
or maybe shes already going by wright
the concierge taps some more
no one of that name
do you have a mrs pearce
the concierge looks at harvey
ill go up
harvey enters the room
he places his case on the bed takes off his jacket and goes to the window
a roller blind is pulled down
harvey tugs on the cord to no avail at first
then suddenly it whips up causing harvey to duck backwards as the flailing cord almost takes his eye out
warily harvey steps forward and looks down at the busy street below
he goes to open the window but it is stuck
he tries again but it wont budge
he looks around the room then up at the now fully contracted blind
tentatively he reaches up and pulls the cord to lower the blind a little
it slowly starts to unravel and unravel
and unravel until it hits the bottom of the window sill with a gentle thud
harvey stands in semi darkness
just then to his relief his phone rings
he hurries over to the bed and retrieves it
yes im here
where are you where is everyone
listens harveys face drops a little oh
no i didnt realise
i thought the plan was for everyone to stay together
noticeably dejected harvey sits down on the bed
i just wasnt sure
so your mother has rented a house for you all
beat i see
no no dont be silly
im a big boy
harvey looks around the bland room
home from home
beat yes ive got the address
so ill see you there
beat i love you too
harvey hangs up
kate dressed for the evening hurries along a street
her phone rings
kates mum stands not far from her back window
what are you wearing
oh youre not
theyre completely in again havent you heard
lifting back the curtain oh youre just being silly
pov a now bare chested neighbour at work in his garden
smoke rising from his shed
now dont be nervous
just be yourself
smiling ok mum
thanks for the advice
ive been thinking about greece for our holiday
frowns ok lets talk about it later
beat i love you too
kate hangs up and crosses a busy road
kates mum continues to spy
pov the neighbour bends down out of sight
on rising again he sees maggie at the window and waves
maggie flinches before dropping the curtain
kate comes through the door
oonagh sits on her own at a booth
kate joins her
sorry im late
dont tell me
makes the gesture of a telephone your mother
shes worrying about her new neighbour
says he barbecues a lot
smiles i know
i got you the same as me
off kates gaze theyre at the bar
he seems very nice
just then two guys approach from the bar
matt embraces kate then turns to his friend
kate this is simon
simon shakes kates hand
kate blushes ever so slightly
beat you work with matt
if you can call it work
laughs a little too eagerly right
come on im feeling small down here
they all sit down
close up of harveys face under shower
harvey puts on a cream linen jacket that matches a pair of slacks
he looks at himself in a full length mirror
he looks good
there is a knock at the door just as his phone rings
harvey opens the door as he answers his phone
just over by the bed
a young african man wheels in a trolley with a pot of tea and some biscuits
shall i open this for you
he heads towards the window
the blind wips up toggle hitting the young man in the eye
are you ok
the porter covering his eye nods backing towards the door
are you sure
harvey wedges a fiver into his free hand as he retreats rapidly
the door closes
harvey returns the phone to his ear
he sits down on the bed and pours some tea
just then his phone rings again
he reaches for it knocking the trolley and the tea onto himself
grabbing a tea towel he dabs his trousers
from a distance across a crowded friday night bar we watch our gang chat
it seems to be going well
laughter hangs in the air
a cab pulls up in front of a posh looking restaurant
harvey steps out dressed in the same cream jacket but now sporting a pair of dark trousers
he looks like a bad lounge act
the cab pulls away as harvey turns towards the restaurant
three young men stand to one side chatting animatedly
on seeing harvey one of them looks up
you made it
scott turns to his friends
this is susans father harvey
beat harvey this is my best man josh stillman and pete turner
how are you harvey
glancing at harveys attire its great to see you
sensing his gaze how are you holding up
turning to his friends cant wait to marry your daughter really
beat is she
shes through there
shell be thrilled youre here
ill go and find her
just then harveys phone rings
harvey turns away and answers
listens no no thats not right
i booked mike
i spoke to him about it two weeks ago
i booked him
getting flustered have you told him its harvey
its really important
suddenly conscious of scotts friends standing nearby just
just get him to call me ok
harvey hangs up
and putting on his positive face turns back to scotts friends
beat always something
beat whats your field harvey
oh im a
beat i work in the music industry
im a composer
beat sort of
what kind of stuff
oh you know for
commercials that sort of thing
beat mostly background stuff that sort of thing
slightly awkward pause
it can be
wanting to change subject you guys work with scott
well im sure thats pretty profitable too
the guys smile a little too readily
harvey tries to smile back
well id better find my daughter
good to meet you harvey
see you in there
as harvey moves off into the adjacent room the guys watch him go
kate and oonagh wait in line for the bathroom
he seems nice
nice like good
or nice like dull
nice like how old is he
he cant be hes looks like a baby
alright my age
but matt says hes very mature
did matt offer that up or was that in response to you two discussing my approaching barrenness
just then kates phone rings
dont answer it
i have to
shes on her own
beat she gets lonely
just tell her youre busy
kate nods and indicates that the loo is free
oonagh goes in as kate answers her phone
harvey enters the room
he sees his daughter standing off to one side with scott talking to some friends
she looks beautiful
he takes a moment to just watch her
as she turns in slight slow motion she smiles on seeing her father and joins him
beat you look beautiful
slightly awkward pause
give us a hug then as they say in this country
off susans look
i know i look ridiculous
like a bad lounge act
susan smiles at her father
i spilt something on my trousers
beat ive been doing that a lot recently
harvey looks over at scott in the distance sharing a laugh with his buddies
long way to come to see two american kids get married
susan looks at her father a little irked
sorry for the inconvenience dad
harvey looks at his daughter
have you seen mum yet
theyre over by our table
harvey looks over
beat ill be good
just then they are approached by scott guiding some friends over to say hello
look who ive got
susans girlfriends shriek with delight as they approach
susan turns to greet them
ill speak to you later suz
you enjoy your friends
as susan greets her friends harvey retreats
kate rejoins the others
oonagh and matt are standing
matt has his jacket on
to kate weve gotta go
problem at home
baby sitter just rang
beat but you guys stay
kate makes eyes at oonagh who shrugs innocently
oonagh goes to kiss kate while matt says goodbye to simon
under breath enjoy yourself you miserable cow
and turn off that phone
beat are you working tomorrow
ill see you tuesday
oonagh kisses kate and heads off with matt leaving kate standing slightly awkwardly next to a seated simon
looks like weve been set up
its not your fault
i mean im fine with it
i mean im happy to meet new people
yes me too
why dont you sit down
kate sits down
so youre oonaghs boss
beat sorry im saying yes a lot
smiles you are
they share a smile
do you want another drink
i can get them
no its fine
what do you fancy
ill have another white wine
simon heads off to the bar
kate watches him go
she allows herself a smile
harvey stands at the bar and downs a whiskey
picking up another glass he turns away and with drink in hand approaches a group of people standing around a table
as he nears a distinguished older man with a healthy main of white hair sees him and momentarily touches the arm of the woman standing next to him
she turns around to see harvey approaching
harvey turns his gaze to the white haired man and nods
good to see you
there is a palpable sense of tension in the air
deliberately only directed to jean so our baby girl is really getting married
who wouldve thought
harvey you remember the watsons
barry and jill
harvey turns to a couple standing nearby
slight sarcastic tone of course i do
hell its been a while
i guess not since jean and i split up
you look well
thank you jill
youre looking well too
both of you
i guess you guys stayed in touch with jean
barry and i work together now
beat property now
a small portfolio down in florida
beat thats really great
well i think we should sit
i know susan wanted us all seated before they joined us
everyone begins to take their assigned seats
harvey is on the inside close to the middle
its a bit tight and involves people getting up to make way
harvey gets to his seat and is just about to sit when his phone rings
brian and jean share a look
taking it out of his pocket harvey looks at the incoming number
sorry i have to take this
picks up can you hold a minute
harvey makes his way back along the table causing people to stand again
harvey walks away from the table
kate sits waiting
simon has finally been served and turns from the bar with drinks in hand
as he does a young woman standing with a small party of two other girls and a guy greets him
kate looks on
its obvious from simons reaction that they know each other well
just then kates phone rings again
she looks at the number and thinks about ignoring it but in the end reluctantly picks up
youve got to stop calling
i cant hear
kate gets up and moves towards the back room
harvey stands on the phone
getting more and more flustered itll take two hours max
listens have you told him its harvey
look we go back
hell tell you
just have him call me
harvey returns to the table
everyone is seated
he notices his name place has been moved to the end
smiling to jean did you move me darling
i didnt touch it
i moved you
i thought it might be easier in case you needed to get out
harvey takes the last remaining seat
shall we have a quick toast to get things going
beat im going to save my big speech for tomorrow
laughter dear susan and dear scott i just want to take us all back to that wonderful holiday we all had in rome together last year and wish you salute
jean and i love you both so much
and were so happy that scott is going to part of our clan now
and so i say many many happy happy years ahead
everyone turns to harvey as he stands to make a speech
just then his phone rings on vibrate
harvey scrambles to turn it off as jean rolls her eyes
sorry i thought it was off
flustered he finally manages to stop it buzzing um uh
beat to susan and scott
a great couple
momentary awkward silence
everyone tucks in
harvey sits slightly blushing at the end of the table knowing hes blown it
kate hangs up and returns to the main room to find that simon has been joined at their table by the young group
kate bolsters herself before returning to the table
beat sorry i bumped into these guys and couldnt shake them
turning to his friends everyone this is kate
kate holds up her hand before blushing a little
kate this is andrew melissa gwen and elinor
kate sits down
sorry i hope were not barging in on your evening
kate shakes her head
it was simons idea
how do you guys know each other anyway
kate glances at simon
we dont really
we just met
melissa looks at simon and grins
a blind date
beat we met through friends
i think we should leave you guys alone
a little too abruptly no
slightly awkward pause broken by andrew
hey does anyone know the cricket score
england were all out by tea when i last checked
dont get it
men in white
oh i do
kate looks on as the girls laugh
harvey sits at the end of the table looking on as everyone talks animatedly around him
he eats his food and drinks plenty of wine
up near the middle scott shares a joke with brian
just then susan who has been talking to the best man turns and catches her fathers eye
he smiles at her and raises a glass
susan smiles back before returning her attention back to her neighbour
kate sits among the group
she too seems to be detached from the proceedings
i heard that they did it in her bedroom while she was away
it was her flat
he has his own but was basically living at hers
that is evil
as the conversation continues in this vein kate glances at simon
he seems more at ease in this company
the meal is drawing to a close
people have gotten up and are circulating around the table and nearby
harvey stands at the bar
he downs a drink
to barman can i get a glass of water please
the barman obliges
downing another drink fine
go easy harvey
getting quite loaded why jean
are you worried im going to embarrass you again
no harvey im worried youre going to embarrass yourself
beat and more importantly susan
this weekends just about her and scott
oh youre good jean
youre really good
youve always known how to make me feel shit havent you
beat youve always been so good at that
ive had cause to practice
tell me jean
were you ever proud of me
beat but you never listened
the parties jean
the fuckin parties where i would hear you dressing up what i did for a living film composer this film composer that trying to make it more palatable for your
cutting him off dont harvey
what is it you see in brian
jean looks into harveys eyes
he doesnt talk about himself
beat he talks about me
harvey stares back momentarily transfixed before turning away dismissive
go home harvey
go to bed and see your daughter get married tomorrow
jean walks away
harvey stands at the bar
susan comes into the room
are you alright
how are you doing
he seems a good guy scott
youll be alright
yeah he is
beat im sorry i havent had much time to talk to you
no sweetheart its your weekend
its no problem
you just enjoy yourself
beat well not great but
you know the usual

harvey looks away then back
listen suz im really sorry about having to leave early
its just bad timing
theres a sudden rush at work you know a couple of big jobs in at once
it just cant be helped
but ill be there at the ceremony at the really important bit
ill be there to give you away
beat and then im sure brian or your mother will talk at the reception
you know me ive never been very good at speech
listen ive been thinking
brian has been a really big part of my life now for some time
long beat and im going to ask him to give me away tomorrow
im sorry dad
the colour drains from harveys ruddy face
dad ive hardly seen you in the past five years
thats not true
dad it is
maybe a quick coffee here or a telephone call there but no you havent been part of my life
beat and brian has
you having to leave early this weekend
i dont know it just seems typical
flash of irritation its work darling
it pays for things
beat sighs sorry
interrupting im sorry dad but its what ive decided
harvey momentarily turns away from his daughter to compose himself before turning back
beat i understand suz
harvey leans in and kisses his daughter on the forehead
you go and be with your friends
go and enjoy yourself
pulls out his phone i gotta make some stupid calls
go and enjoy yourself sweetheart
ill see you tomorrow
susan reluctantly walks away as harvey lifts the phone to his ear
we hold on his face
with susan gone he lowers the phone
he looks frightened
harvey enters the rest room and heads to a bank of basins
he turns on a tap and bends down drinking profusely
he splashes his face then rises and begins to dry it with some paper towels
you fuckin asshole
harvey suddenly bends over as though hed been punched hard in the stomach
he rises red in the face holding his nose desperately trying to hold it in
but he cant harvey sobs huge heaving muffled cries
just then someone enters
head down harvey lunges for the door and exits
harvey stumbles out of the restaurant and into a waiting cab
the cab pulls away
kate sits surrounded by laughter
simons attention is firmly fixed on his friends
kates humiliation is magnified as we slowly move into her face
kate gets up and walks away
everyone momentarily stops chatting and looks to simon who shrugs
kate enters a cubicle
she sits down to have a pee
we hold on her sad face
she suddenly grimaces before holding firm
but not before a tear has been expelled and rolls down her cheek
she swats it away
we hold on harveys sad face as it gently bobs in the back of a moving cab
kate exits the pub just as a cab pulls up
as harvey exits one side kate gets into the other as the cab pulls away again
bride and groom stand at the head of the room saying their vows
harvey stands near the back looking on
as the ceremony is concluded the audience spontaneously burst into applause
harvey looks around the room then back at his daughter as she smiles giddily at her husband
harvey slips out the door
carrying his case harvey hails a taxi and gets in
kate back in green stands next to a young couple asking them questions about their travel arrangements
the taxi comes to a stop in classic mid day london traffic
harvey glances at his watch then out at the mass of cars in front of them
his phone rings
he picks up
the line goes dead
harvey puts his phone away
he glances out the window again as the taxi crawls forward before again coming to a stop
harvey leans forward
is there another way we could try
the driver looking a little irked glances at harvey in his mirror
its going to be bad everywhere
your presidents in town
its causing chaos
harvey rubs his neck and glances again at his watch
kate eats a snack while reading a book
her phone suddenly rings
she sighs quietly before slowly picking it up
a taxi pulls up
harvey gets out pays the driver and hurries into the terminal
the counter is mobbed
a long queue snakes away from it
harvey hurries to the front where a male steward is attending to another passenger
im sorry but im on the
to hey pal were all in hurry
just hand luggage can i go straight to the gate
sir im dealing with a passenger youll have to wait
ive gotta make that flight
sir everyone is in a hurry
youll just have to wait
harvey sees another steward momentarily free and turns to her
miss im on the

im afraid that flights now closed
but its not yet
i just have hand luggage
it doesnt take off for another minutes
im sorry sir but we have to close the gate minutes prior to departure

harvey looks around
whens the next flight

i can put you on stand by but i doubt youll get on
beat the earliest i can get you on for sure is tomorrow morning
people look over
sir im sorry but you have to stay calm
harvey looks about him
harvey sits holding his phone
he dials a number lifting the phone to his ear
he gets voice mail
listen theres been a mess up the traffic was crazy
im going to have to reschedule the pitch slightly
frank can set up
ill email him the cue numbers he knows what to do
and then ill be there lunch time at the latest
ill come straight from the airport
ill try you again shortly
harvey hangs up and stares at the phone
he looks up and around the terminal
a young child has a tantrum nearby
suddenly his phone rings
i got your message
the traffic was insane
interrupting the traffic harvey
stay in london
enjoy your daughters wedding
well talk when you get back
its fine ill be there lunch time
its no problem
steve knows what i need

beat sighs its out of my hands harvey
i have people to answer to
we just cant afford the space
beat were letting you go
letting me go
cant afford the space
marvin ill be there lunch time
im sorry harvey
beat sighs call me when you get back
the line goes dead
harvey closes his phone
he stares ahead into space then stands and walks away
kate closes up the booth
kate sits at a table near the bar drinking a glass of wine and reading her book
she glances up as a man enters
harvey takes a seat at the bar
jamesons no ice
the barman serves harvey
harvey immediately downs it
the barman refills his glass
again harvey knocks it back
kate glances up from her book
the barman glances at harvey
harvey reaches for the now full glass
but knocks it spilling it into his lap
kate looks up again along with the few other patrons in the bar
harvey registers their gaze
kate smiles before returning to her book
harvey dabs his trousers with some napkins
to himself i know we dont raise our voices in this country
its not done
harvey puts the sodden napkins down onto the bar
he looks at himself in the mirror behind the bar and rubs his chest
he sighs and glances around the room
he sees kate and recognizes her
to kate im sorry
kate looks up
i was rude
you tried to ask me some questions
you were just trying to do your job and i was rude
i dont really remember but im sure you were
most people are
kate returns to her book
kate looks up
it probably would be if i could finish it
holds up his hands i get it
harvey downs another shot
kate looks up again
looks over sorry
i said thatll help
believe me it will
i reckon itll help as much as that trashy novel and a glass of chardonnay
harvey winces lowering his head into his hand
putting some money onto the bar he turns and joins kate taking a seat at an adjacent table
im really sorry
that was out of line
looks up what
go away and stop apologizing
its just that ive had a really shitty day
looking back at her book join the club
i mean really shitty
yours may have been shitty but mine was shittier
finally kate looks up again at this strange man
i missed my flight
i lost my job
and my daughter who got married in london today asked her step father rather than me to give her away
kate looks at harvey sympathetically for a moment
beat but what can i do for you
beat make it worse maybe
let me make it up to you
beat would you let me buy you lunch
what time is it tea time
ill buy you tea
kate blushes ever so slightly
thats very sweet of you but
i dont know you
you dont know me
thats why we should have lunch tea
kate cant help but smile
thank you but
she indicates her book
because youve got your book
and its a good replacement for humans
kate smiles and nods
just then her phone rings
if thats for me im in the shower
kate smiles as she takes out her phone and looks at the incoming number
she is about to answer when she stops herself
arent you going to answer that
she thinks for a moment before putting the phone back
should i take that as a hopeful sign
kate cant help but smile
if it is you could just give me a little wider smile
kate cant help but smile wider
kates mum pulls the phone away from her ear perplexed by the lack of response
her eyes wander to the window
drawing back the curtain she looks out
pov the neighbour now sporting a white apron busies himself as usual
he suddenly bends down and heaves what would best be described as a body bag onto his shoulder
as he stumbles under the weight he carries it into the shed
kates mum turns away ashen
harvey and kate remain seated at adjacent tables
muzak plays in the background
they are now virtually the sole patrons of chez gerard
kate eats a salad and reads her book
just then harveys food arrives
look we are having lunch together
looks up and smiles no
were having lunch next to each other
beat suddenly holds out his hand im harvey
takes it kate
kate cant help but smile at harveys persistence
she puts down her book
so why arent you at the wedding
harvey momentarily taken aback by the directness of kates question is about to answer when the sound of a vacuum cleaner erupts
harvey and kate look over to see a cleaner vacuuming the floor nearby
ah thats better
i knew something was missing
shouting over the din i had to get back for a work thing
over the din a work thing
for the job you just lost
over din yes
over din i see
beat so this job you lost
you liked it
over din yes
theyve beaten it out of me
but its what i do did
over din which is was
shouts im a composer

the vacuuming stops
they both look over then back
thats about the normal response
anything i would of heard
long beat well maybe i mean it maybe before your time
smiles no go on
harvey smiles a little sheepishly
singsong voice you can take the salem out of the country but you cant take the country out of salem
its a cigarette
the vacuuming starts up again
they look over then back
over din did you always want to write jingles or was there something more
no i just love the way you
you just cut through it
ill take that as a compliment
beat i was going to be a jazz pianist
were you good
harvey looks away
im sorry i can be nosey
i tend to blurt stuff out
breaking from his reverie
i like it
i like it
beat over din alot
kate looks away
its a relief to find someone in this country who actually says what they feel
oh havent you heard
thats all changed
were a nation changed
ever since diana weve unlocked ourselves
everythings flowing out
beat you guys showed us the way
just as were trying to adopt your stiff upper lip
what is a stiff upper lip exactly
harvey tries to physicalize it
no i think its more this
kate stretches her top lip
copies her hows that
top lip stretched yeah youre getting there
stretch it out further
let me see again
no now youre doing a bulldog
no now you look like you dont have any teeth
beat are they your own
the front ones
my dad had a front one that you could just take out
as they sit there lips stretched nattering away we start to pull back
accompanied by a simple piano score we look on as they appear to us momentarily like an ordinary couple
harvey and kate exit the restaurant
they stand opposite each other in the quietening terminal
so did i
slightly awkward pause
kate glances at her watch
i should get going
i have a class
a bit sheepish yes
beat twice a week
just something i do
changing the subject
i take the heathrow express
what about you
harvey hadnt really thought
i dont know
i guess ill stay in a hotel near here
my flights in the morning
its been a pleasure
yes it has
they shake hands smiling
just then kates phone rings again
theres your phone again
id better go
kate turns and leaves
harvey watches her go
harvey picks up a hotel phone
id like a room please
beat one night
kate waits on the platform as a train glides into the station
kate stands in a crowded middle section
a mild commotion ensues down the other end of the carriage as somebody squeezes aboard at the last
kate looks up to see harvey making his way down the crowded carriage
people reluctantly make way for harvey and his case
he finally arrives next to kate as the train jolts forward
momentarily losing his balance harvey steadies himself on a businessmans shoulder
kate leans forward to help as the businessman turns slightly irritated
turning to kate hi
a little sheepish i thought i might as well stay in town
more fun than a hotel next to a runway right
harvey smiles a little sheepishly as the train speeds off
the train speeds past on its way into london
harvey and kate stand next to each other gently swaying in the crowded carriage
the businessman standing next to harvey talks loudly on his phone about his days conquest
harvey and kate share a look
in a keatonesque performance harvey keeping his body rigid slowly leans further and further away from the man making kate smile
the train pulls into the station
we watch as harvey and kate alight with the crowd
they come to a stop outside
its still light
a beautiful fall afternoon
taxis are over there
theyll take you to wherever you need to go
harvey looks towards the taxi rank
so i guess its goodbye again
looks up at the evening sky beat so i couldnt walk you to your class could i
beat carry your books
beat stand near the curb so you dont get splashed
is that a yes
beat why not
montage accompanied by a wonderfully romantic little ditty we watch from a distance as harvey and kate navigate the buzzing streets of central london
all is alive and well
harvey drops his suitcase off at the same hotel he was staying in before
as they wander through the city foreign students mingle policemen chat and office workers linger
london is at its best
the sky glows a pale orange as harvey and kate walk and talk along the south bank
yours is a beautiful city kate
kate looks at harvey a moment then smiles
its just a funny way of saying it
quite old fashioned
but i like it
beat yours is glorious country honeychurch
harvey looks at kate quizzically
its a line from a book
room with a view
harvey shakes his head
im afraid im not much of a reader
beat too fidgety i guess
kate looks at harvey
you think less of me
no were just quite different thats all
is that bad
thinks about it no
just then kates phone rings again
both our phones ring a lot
we have that in common
they come to a stop as kate takes out her phone and looks at the handset display
i should probably take this
beat ive been busy
beat no im out
yes with someone
no someone else
looks at harvey a man
we hear maggies warble continue as kate listens
you did did you
beat an actual body
harvey looks at kate
kate shakes her head
ill come over tomorrow and we can check it out together
beat i have to go now
just get an early night and ill see you tomorrow
beat i love you too
kate hangs up
beat my mother
she worries about you
beat shes convinced shes living next to polands answer to ted bundy
they start walking again
she means well
shes just had a tough run
long beat my father ran off to france with his secretary
then mum got cancer about four years ago now
shes fully recovered
but wont admit it
beat shes basically bored
and my continued situation as she calls it being single is her major distraction
her pastime if you will
yes my rotting eggs are her raison detre
grimaces turns to harvey sorry
i talk too much
i like it
kate comes to a stop and looks at harvey
beat well here we are
harvey looks up at a grey municipal building
how long is the class
can i wait
beat sorry i promise im not bundyish
smiles its getting cold
you dont want to wait
yes i do
smiling and backing towards the building careful i might get the wrong impression
what can you do
maggie very tentatively lifts her curtain again
no sign of the killer
suddenly the doorbell rings
as maggie slowly approaches the front door the doorbell rings again
she slowly leans in and peers through the peep hole
pov the neighbour looms large
he holds in his arms a large something wrapped in paper
maggie pulls her head away
she looks again
pov the neighbour bends down out of sight and then rises again turning to leave
maggie watches him go
the door slowly opens
maggie looks around then notices the thing wrapped in paper on the ground
she quickly picks it up and takes it inside
as daylight fades harvey sits waiting
through a large ground floor window he watches kate as her class wraps up
as she comes out he gets up and joins her
how did it go
oh the usual
beat lovely mild mannered mike read us the latest installment from his physcho sexual thriller and we all tried to look at him in the same way after
shall we keep walking
harvey and kate walk under waterloo bridge past the second hand bookstalls
a man plays a saxophone melancholically
do you ever wish you could try a different life
beat just for a day
just to see what it would be like
what would yours be
looks down at her uniform well no green thats for sure
beat thinks it would take place in spain
a little house inland
and what would you do there
i dont know
beat write the great novel
beat i think ive got one inside me
were not talking high art
just a bloody good holiday read
so this house in spain would have a little cabana looking out over the plains for you to write in
and a little stream running by to bathe in
beat sorry thats if youre receiving guests
kate smiles coming to a stop
sure you can visit harvey shine
why thank you kate walker
just then a sort of skiffle come rockabilly busking act starts up
two girls and a guy
harvey and kate stand amongst the crowd watching
the south bank is at its vibrant best
with the sound of the skiffle act still playing in the distant background harvey and kate take a seat on some steps over looking the river
as darkness descends street lamps reflect off the water
they sit in silence
what happened harvey
beat between you and your daughter
harvey shakes his head
i dont know
beat somewhere along the way i lost her
i lost my family
beat i just woke up one morning and realised i didnt belong
id always had this mean little feeling in my stomach that they were a bit embarrassed by me
beat if you saw them now with brian susans step father
youd see they make more sense
they look right together
harvey looks out over the thames
ive not been a great father
kate looks at harveys sad profile
she thinks for a moment
its still going on
looks at his watch i guess
harvey looks up
kate looks at harvey
you must go
what the hell are you doing here
you must go
harvey shakes his head
she doesnt need me
stop feeling so sorry for yourself
shes your daughter youre her father
harvey shakes his head again
kate is not about to give up
harvey it would be unforgivable not to go
beat only if you come with me
please come with me
smiles as my friend
kate momentarily blushes then shakes her head
harvey firstly im not about to go to anyones wedding in a green polyester work suit
secondly its not right
well find you a dress
if we find you a dress will you come
music montage the song is the same as that played by the buskers
its a fast fun rockabilly skiffle thingy
we watch as harvey and kate buy a dress
handheld double speed
a taxi pulls up and out step harvey and kate
kate looks fantastic on harveys arm as they walk up the front steps
a reception is in full swing
the doors close behind harvey and kate as they enter an elevator
harvey and kate stand side by side in silence
they both smile a little anxiously almost like teenagers
there is a loud ping as the elevator doors open onto a hallway
harvey and kate step forward
down the hall through some double doors we hear the familiar din of a buzzing reception
harvey momentarily falters
kate encourages harvey forward
the doors open and harvey and kate enter
jean looks up and sees harvey with kate
she shakes her head
susan sees harvey and gets up
she joins him
i didnt go
off susans look harvey turns to kate
this is kate
you look fantastic
slightly awkward pause
im really sorry to gate crash
your father sort of insisted
no its fine
looks around theres room
susan looks back at the full top table
you get back
dont worry about us well find a place
stops a passing waiter could you find them a seat please
pete acting as master of ceremonies stands and clinks his glass for attention
id better go
and now for the best mans speech
except we seem to be missing the bride
laughter oh no here she is
susan heads back and resumes her seat at top table
the best man takes the mic
what can i say
the waiter leads harvey and kate to a table
im afraid this is the only place left
the waiter shows them to a few empty seats at the childrens table
harvey and kate take their seats
the kids stare at them
a brace clad large girl in a white frilly dress speaks
are you uncle harvey
ive heard about you
beat youre not miriams kid are you
i mean grown up
kate feels someones eyes on her and turns to her left to find a smartly dressed young boy of about eight staring up at her with his mouth open
kate nods her head
the boy remains silent keeping his gormless gaze fixed on kate
now youre not to dominate the conversation tonight
turning back to harvey chatterbox to my left
so without further ado id like to propose a toast to susan for making my friend scott complete
the audience whoop and clap
scott gives his best man a hug
and now ladies and gentlemen
it is the turn of the father of the bride to say a few words
and tonight that task will be carried out by the very charming and distinguished brian
more clapping as brian stands
kate glances at harvey who blushes
well thats quite some speech josh
quite something to follow
but i shall try
harvey suddenly stands and clears his throat
nobody really hears
he picks up his glass and a spoon and begins to tap it
people stir and turn to harvey
brian comes to a stop
jean looks on furious
sorry to interrupt
everyone stares at harvey
but you see i cant just sit hear and watch somebody else give my baby girl away
susans my daughter and im her father
not the best by far but her father all the same
a waiter brings harvey a microphone
its arrival slightly throws him
i should have prepared something but
i guess it reminds me of a joke
harvey continually knocks the mic against his chest causing terrible feedback
then harvey drops the mic
jean stands up
for gods sake harvey dont make a scene
harvey stares out at the party
they all stare back at him
he glances down at kate who smiles back
harvey lifts the microphone up off the table and raises it to his lips
i want to make a scene
im tired of being embarrassed
beat if we cant make a scene on the day of our daughters wedding then when can we
i want to make a scene
i want to shout
i wanna tell the world how lucky it is to have our suzie in it
i wanna tell scott how damn lucky he is
people start to clap
smiling and also if he ever hurts her i know people in north of london
scott i swear you have found in susan a bright and passionate person
and a loyal friend
and i can see from the way she looks at you
from the way she is with you that she is
beat and i thank you and welcome you to the family
harvey and scott share a look
the room applauds loudly
and finally if i can linger a moment longer
i would like to turn it back over to brian with a note of
beat thank you for being there for my baby girl
thank you for being there when i wasnt
brian nods to harvey before standing and raising his glass
if you would all please join harvey and i in a toast
beat to susan and scott
susan and scott
everyone claps loudly
susan shares a gentle smile with her father
harvey sits and looks at kate anxiously
kate smiles and nods
she indicates to the rest of the table
harvey turns to their now animated young neighbours who all sit clapping
ladies and gentlemen the first dance
the band strike up as susan and scott take to the dance floor
they dance a slow dance
harvey and kate sit watching
after a while susan looks over for her father
harvey hesitates before kate encourages him up
she plucks a flower from the table display and places it in his lapel
harvey joins susan and scott on the dance floor
shaking scotts hand he leads susan into a dance
thanks for coming back dad
thanks for having me back
kate looks on as harvey dances happily with his daughter
feeling something she turns to find the eight year olds head slumped against her shoulder as he sleeps soundly
kate smiles at her lot
back on the dance floor harvey encourages brian to take over the dance with susan
harvey turns away and is joined by uncle fred and gang
they all chat animatedly
uncle fred pushes harvey into a dance with his wife
a boogie strikes up
kate looks on as harvey dances and reunites with his extended family
she sees the delight in his face
she looks around at all the happy faces
its time perhaps to let the family celebrate alone
extricating herself from the sleeping boy she pushes two chairs together and makes a bed for him
covering him in a jacket she glances back at the dance floor before turning to leave
back on the dance floor a boogie is in full swing
harvey caught up in the fun energetically swings aunt maddie around
he suddenly catches himself and turns to his table to look for kate but finds it empty save for a row of dozing children
harvey makes his excuses and turns away looking for kate amongst the crowded room
kate retrieves her coat and makes her way down the hall towards the bank of elevators
harvey hurries to the exit
on turning into the hall he sees kate standing in the distance
just then she steps forward and out of sight
kate stands in the empty elevator waiting for the doors to close
she stares at her feet
just then we hear a burst of a piano being played
kate looks up to see across the hallway in an empty conference room harvey seated at a grand piano
he smiles a showmans smile before giving it another old school burst
he stops again
just then the doors begin to close
kate reaches forward and presses a button opening them
harvey starts up again but this time he plays something sincere beautiful
kate listens before slowly stepping out of the elevator
she walks towards him joining him at the piano
harvey slides along the seat and indicates for kate to join him
she does so and listens as harvey plays beautifully
he finally brings the piece to an end
one of yours
harvey smiles at kate
you are very kind
beat shearing doing rogers
you play it very well
bows his head a little with a smile well thank you ms
youre most welcome mr shine
they share a little smile
me thinks you were leaving
indeed i was sire
because you looked happy
harvey looks quizzically at kate
you should be with your family harvey
but you know maybe i want to be with you
beat sings you make me happy when skies are grey
for making me come here
they share a look before both looking away
just then a vacuum cleaner sounds
they both look up as a cleaning lady vacuums the floor nearby
hey kid theyre playing our song
in the background we hear clapping and cheering coming from the reception
a funky number starts up
harvey takes kates hand
excited come on
i want you to meet people
i want them to meet you
harvey leads a slightly reluctant kate back down the hall towards the reception
the band let rip on a funky tune
the congregation fill the dance floor
harvey leads kate back into the room and heads straight for the dance floor
as they pass relatives along the way harvey introduces them to kate
much hugging and kissing ensues
harvey and kate dance a boogie
uncle fred and aunt maddie join them
uncle fred steals kate from harvey and twirls her off
montage fun and frolics on the dance floor
harvey is at the center of it all
he initiates a horah
a congo line
kates face says it all shes having a ball
the sleeping kid sleeps
close up on the m
ladies and gentlemen
the bride and groom are about to leave
please join me outside to send them off in style
harvey and kate join the rest of the congregation outside on the steps of the hotel
harvey looks on as his daughter and son in law head to an awaiting car
susan stops and throws the bouquet behind her
it is caught by aunt maddie who in turn throws it and it is caught by harveys all grown up niece
she blushes profusely revealing an impressive set of braces on her teenage teeth
susan kisses her mother and brian goodbye
and is about to get into the car when she stops and hurries over to harvey
she hugs him tightly
pulling away she turns to kate
be gentle with him
kate nods as susan turns to leave
to kate sorry
as the car pulls away everyone cheers
harvey looks on
his eyes momentarily lock onto his ex wifes
they share a conciliatory look
as harvey watches his daughters car disappear down the street kate looks at him
he turns back
yes i am
harvey looks around
you wanna get out of here
harvey and kate walk
the streets are quiet
there is already a hint of dawn in the sky
rubbish trucks manoeuvre
they turn into the courtyard of sommerset house and take a seat on some chairs
the sky lightens
i dont think ive stayed up all night since i was a student
they stare out over the courtyard
harvey looks at kate for a beat
you got sad
kate looks back at harvey and tries to read him
she looks down at her lap then up out over the courtyard
oh i dont know
my uniforms green
the sun begins to creep above the buildings
harvey and kate look out across the courtyard
i was pregnant once
beat i didnt have it
didnt give it a moments thought
beat thats what smart girls did
i do sometimes wonder what theyd be like today
beat whether theyd be smart
beat i dont know its silly
harvey looks at kate in the morning light
kate blushes and looks away
i dont know why i just told you that
beat im glad
harvey looks away then back
meet me here tomorrow
exactly here at these chairs
kate smiles determinedly trying to keep it light
what about your flight harvey
i dont want to leave
beat guess why
i wanna be with you
kates blush deepens she looks away and laughs
shut up harvey
kate glances at harvey trying see the truth in his eyes
you say that now but wait until tomorrow
today is tomorrow
harvey we know nothing about each other
a bit older yes
beat i can be mean
so can i
so can i
kate cant help but smile
she glances towards the street
standing i should be going
i know enough to know ill be here
waiting at this chair
kate looks at harvey then again towards the street
i mean it
beat ill be here
kate smiles a little smile
she suddenly believes him
she steps backwards
harvey gets up and joins her
they look at each other
harvey suddenly leans in and kisses kate
pulling away cant help smiling sorry
can i have something until tomorrow
kate reaches for her purse and pulls out a photo
she gives it to harvey
stepping backwards i must go
she turns and leaves hurrying to catch a bus
harvey stands holding an old library card
he looks down
on it is a faded photo of toothy young girl no older than eleven
harvey looks up and smiles
kate takes a seat on the top deck of a bus
taking a moment to catch her breath she looks out the window
turning back she allows herself a smile
harvey with a croissant lodged in his mouth and a cup of coffee in hand buys a morning paper
he turns and crosses the road skipping up the steps of his hotel
harvey enters and waving to a slightly bemused concierge heads to the bank of elevators
im afraid theyre both out of order sir
harvey glances at the sign then over to the stairwell
i guess ill walk then
harvey a man seemingly impatient to start a new life runs up the steps
surprised at first by his agility he begins to slow
he stops to catch his breath
suddenly his spare hand holds tight onto the bannister
unsteady harvey sits down
close up on harveys face confused
he tries to stand but again is forced back down
he begins to place his coffee on the stair next to him but suddenly shudders grabbing his shoulder
the coffee topples spilling down the steps
frightened and confused harvey sits alone in the stairwell
just then a door opens and the african porter from before comes through carrying a tray
he sees harvey
sir are you ok
harvey looks up in a daze then shakes his head
kate with a skip in her step walks through the bustling mid day streets of london
she stops off and buys a bag of cherries from a fruit veg vendor
as the porter and concierge talk to a medic harvey sits in the back of an ambulance
the door is closed
kate sits waiting expectantly on the same chairs they had sat on earlier
she applies some lipstick
harvey sits attached to various monitors and such surrounded by doctors and nurses
he looks agitated and confused
ive got to go
ive got to be somewhere
sir i need you to stay calm
it looks to me like arrhythmia an irregular heart beat
ts thats what ive been trying to tell the nurse
ive had it since i was a kid
i take primax
i guess ive been forgetting to take it recently
ive been under alot of stress thats all
well ok then we probably know where were at
but i need to check all possibilities
as time passes we watch as kates expression slowly turns from expectant to resigned
i know its arrhythmia
please i have to be there
sir im sure it is
but my job is to make sure its not that
i wouldnt be doing my job if i didnt check out absolutely everything
beat nurse well do an ekg followed by bloods
and can you arranfe a monitored bed for him for tonight
as another pad is attached to his chest harvey looks beaten
kate looks on as some kids play in the fountain nearby
she self consciously smooths a fold in her skirt then looks at her watch
she looks down at the brown paper bag of cherries
suddenly a resigned smile flashes across her face shes been here before nothing new
kate gets up and leaves
we watch her walk away
sound of a vacuum cleaner
open on a close up of kates face it says it all
kate vacuums her mothers floor
she turns it off and unplugs it
coiling up the cord kate puts the vacuum cleaner into a cupboard under the stairs
calling out ok mum thats me im done
maggie comes out of the kitchen
why dont you stay and have some lunch
i cant ive got to go
beat not to pry or anything but why is there a large smoked ham under the stairs
oh that yes
the neighbour gave it to me
the polish neighbour
beat so probably not a mass murderer
are you sure youre going to be alright
of course i will
ill be fine
men who needs them
remember weve got greece to look forward to
resigned kate hugs her mum
kate exits her mothers house and passes paddy the postman
looking lovely as ever
resigned thank you
kate walks off down the street
harvey stands at a counter in a busy reception area
he has his phone lodged in the crook of his neck
in front of him lies an open phone directory
its some sort of statistics agency
that sounds right
yes based out at heathrow
listens thank you
turns to a receptionist miss could i borrow your pen
the receptionist obliges as harvey scribbles down a number on an old envelope
thanks thanks alot
a phone rings behind the counter
oonagh picks up
beat hold on
calling out kate its for you
some guy called harvey
kate stands nearby holding a clipboard about to head out onto the floor
she looks at oonagh
she thinks for a beat then shakes her head silently gesturing she not there
oonagh a little perplexed goes back on the phone
um im sorry
shes not here
harvey phone to ear thinks for a beat
he knows shes there
oonagh pulls the phone away and gestures again to kate
kate shakes her head
oonagh reluctantly lifts the phone to her ear
im sorry shes busy
beat she wont come
oonagh hangs up looking at kate
kate shrugs defensively before turning to go
we hold on kates confused face as she walks away
harvey having hung up lowers the phone from his ear
he looks around the room
seated across the way an old man stares back at him
a receptionist arrives with some forms
if i could just get you to sign these youll be all done
harvey signs a form
beat and thats it
harvey glances at the receptionist she is roughly kates age
just then his phone rings
he picks up hopefully
hey harvey its marvin
where are you
turns from the counter oh im still in london marvin
well you get yourself back here my friend
ive got some great news

the samuelson account
none of the kids could handle it
they couldnt nail it
they ended up picking one of your old tunes
they want you to come back and update it
beat we need you back harvey
your old rooms here waiting for you
harvey looks around the room at the lonely figures waiting
a young boy fidgets
next to him sits a young man lost in thought
well thats great marvin
yeah its great
i mean look i know when to eat humble pie
so look hey when can you get back here
harvey glances back at the old man
the old man continues to stare back
something changes in harvey
im not coming back
im quitting marvin
what you mean you quit
harvey fuck you man you need us
no you know i dont
as you said its my last chance
beat look i gotta go
harvey hangs up
a smile breaks across his face
harvey exits the hospital
calling out taxi
a taxi pulls up
as quick as you can
harvey gets in as the taxi speeds away
aggie manning the booth attends to some passengers
a taxi pulls up
harvey hurries out
harvey approaches the booth
excuse me im looking for a kate
aggie eyes harvey a little warily
who wants to know
beat more than a friend
aggie tuts and calls behind her
theres a man here looking for kate says hes more than a friend
more than a friend
oonagh comes out from the office eyeing harvey suspiciously
youre the american
long beat she likes you
i can tell
beat now dont you go messing her around
dont you hurt her
oonagh continues to eye harvey
shes not here
shes left for the day
beat but you might find her at her class
looks at her watch i think it starts around now
down on the southbank
at the national
yes i know
oh you do do you
beat well go on
go get her
harvey turns and hurries away
oonagh and aggie share a smile
the blood oozes from his wound like dark chocolate on a warm summers day
kate sits listening in a daze as mild mannered mike unleashes his latest
harvey alights from the taxi paying the driver
everyone gathers their things as the class wraps
harvey hurries towards the southbank
kate comes down from the upper terrace of the national saying her good byes to her classmates
in her hand she holds a book
as she turns she sees harvey coming to a stop in the distance
she momentarily falters before approaching
youre still here still in london
beat kate i just wanted to apologise and explain
no you dont have to explain its fine no but i do i dont need to hear its fine seriously
but i want to
comes out i had to go to hospital
no its nothing im fine i just forgot to take my pills

how do you know what it is

smiling well young men get it too
kate cant help but smile

kate takes a breath and gives him the practical response shes gone over in her head

beat i live in willesden
and you live in white plains
and were not teenagers so you know monday morning and life kicks in all that jobs and family and brown envelopes with bills in it was a lovely day and
i wont forget it but its not exactly real life
it can be
no harvey its not
kate i want this
i want you
a button is pushed in kate
but its not just about you is it
beat you dont know anything about me
look at me
i expected you not to show for gods sake
i think i even wanted you not to be there its easier that way
beat you you just dive in wherever deep end whoosh
but im not your bloody swimming pool harvey
starting to break
and i am not going to do it im not going to do it because it will hurt
not right now maybe but soon there will be a its not quite working is it or a i need some space or whatever it is and itll end and
itll hurt and i wont do it i wont and
oh fuck i dont want to cry
i dont want this
kate turns and walks away standing by the balustrade looking down at the river below
she takes a seat on a bench
harvey gives her her space
then slowly he approaches leaning against a tree nearby
i think its actually easier for me to be disappointed
i think im actually angry at you for trying to take that away
just then kates phone rings
she reaches into her bag and takes it out
she stares at the phone thinking for a beat before answering
firmly mum i love you but not now
she hangs up
should i take that as a hopeful sign
kate cant help but smile
if you just give me a little wider smile
smiling laughing oh shut up harvey
kate collecting herself looks up at harvey
so hows this going to work mr shine
i have absolutely no idea
beat but it will
beat i promise you that
kate stares at harvey for the longest while
shall we walk
kate gathers up her things stands and joins harvey
they begin to walk
after a short while kate stops puts her hand on harveys shoulder and takes off her shoes
harvey glances down at kates feet then up at her
i think youre my kinda girl
harvey and kate smile
and as they walk away from us we hear
why dont you ask me those questions
you know from the airport
when i wouldnt stop
oh the questionnaire
place of residence
im in transition
we watch as harvey and kate disappear into the sea of london
