href b b barrylyndon screenplay by stanley kubrick based on the novel by william makepeace thackeray february brief shot of duel
my father who was well known to the best circles in this kingdom under the name of roaring harry james was killed in a duel when i was fifteen years
james talking with a suitor roderick at a distance
my mother after her husbands death and her retirement lived in such a way as to defy slander
she refused all offers of marriage declaring that she lived now for her son only and for the memory of her departed saint
mother and son walking together
my mother was the most beautiful women of her day
but if she was proud of her beauty to do her justice she was still more proud of her son and has said a thousand times to me that i
was the handsomest fellow in the world
mother and son entering church
the good souls pleasure was to dress me and on sundays and holidays i turned out in a velvet coat with a silver hilted sword by my side and a
gold garter at my knee as fine as any lord in the land
as we walked to church on sundays even the most envious souls would allow that there was not a prettier pair in the kingdom
the dugan family
my uncles family consisted of ten children and one of them was the cause of all my early troubles this was the belle of the family my cousin miss dorothy
dugan by name
a sprawling run down irish manor house with large garden stables barn and farm
idealized images of dorothy
that first affair how well one remembers it
what a noble discovery it is that the boy makes when he finds himself actually and truly in love with some one
a lady who is skilled in dancing or singing never can perfect herself without a deal of study in private
so it is with the dear creatures who are skilled in coquetting
dorothy for instance was always practicing and she would take poor me to rehearse her accomplishments upon
dorothy talking with the exciseman
or the exciseman when he came his rounds
dorothy talking to the steward
or the steward
dorothy sitting under a tree with the curate reading a book
or the poor curate
dorothy talking to the apothecarys lad
or the young apothecarys lad from dugans town whom i recollect beating once for that very reason
roderick fighting with apothecarys lad
the torments of jealousy she made me endure were horrible
dorothy like a greyhound released from days of confinement and given the freedom of the fields at last runs at top speed left and right back and forth returning every
moment to roderick
she runs and runs until she is out of breath and then laughs at the astonishment which keeps roderick motionless and staring at her
after catching her breath and wiping her forehead she challenges roderick to a race
i accept but i insist on a wager
the loser must do whatever the winner pleases
do you see the gate at the end of the field
the first to touch it will be the winner
they line up together and start on a count of three
dorothy uses all her strength but roderick holds back and dorothy touches the gate five or six paces ahead of him
i was certain to win but i meant to lose to see what she would order me to do
dorothy catches her breath thinking of the penalty
then she goes behind the trees and a few second later comes out and says your penalty is to find a cherry colored ribbon which i have hidden somewhere on
you are free to look for it anywhere you will and i will think very little of you if you do not find it
they sit down on the grass
roderick searches her pockets the fold of her short bodice and her skirt then her shoes then he turns up her skirt slowly and circumspectly as high as her garters
which she wears upon the knee
he unfastens them and finds nothing he draws down her skirt and gropes under her armpits
the tickling makes her laugh
i feel the ribbon
then you must get it
roderick has to unlace her bodice and touch her pretty breasts over which his hand must pass to reach it
why are you shaking
with pleasure at finding the ribbon
one hundred english troops a few mounted officers a small military band fifty local people
the dugan family roderick and his mother captains best and grogan
roderick admires the troops in their splendid uniforms
about this time the united kingdom was in a state of great excitement from the threat generally credited of a french invasion
the noblemen and people of condition in that and all other parts of the kingdom showed their loyalty by raising regiments of horse and foot to resist the invaders
how i envied them
the whole country was alive with wars alarums the three kingdoms ringing with military music while poor i was obliged to stay at home in my fustian jacket and sigh
for fame in secret
dorothy and roderick entering
once the officers of the kilwangen regiment gave a grand ball to which dorothy persuaded my to take her
several cuts depicting the evening
dorothy ignores roderick dances chats laughs drinks punch and finally strolls outside with captain best
roderick makes a half hearted try at dancing with miss clancy
i have endured torments in my life but none like that
some of the prettiest girls there offered to console me for i was the best dancer in the room but i was too wretched and so remained alone all night
in a state of agony
i did not care for drink or know the dreadful comfort of it in those days but i thought of killing myself and dorothy and most certainly of making away
with captain best
the guests leaving and saying their goodbyes
at last and at morning the ball was over
dorothy and roderick on horseback together
sure its a bitter night roderick dear and youll catch cold without a handkerchief to your neck
to this sympathetic remark from the pillion the saddle made no reply
did you and miss clancy have a pleasant evening roderick
you were together i saw all night
to this the saddle only replies by grinding his teeth and giving a lash to daisy
mercy you make daisy rear and throw me you careless creature you
the pillion had by this got her arm around the saddles waist and gave it the gentlest squeeze in the world
i hate miss clancy you know i do
and i only danced with her because because the person with whom i intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night
i had not been in the room five minutes before i was engaged for every single set
were you obliged to dance five times with captain best and then stroll out with him into the garden
i dont care a fig for captain best he dances prettily to be sure and is a pleasant rattle of a man
he looks well in his regimentals too and if he chose to ask me to dance how could i refuse him
but you refused me dorothy
i can dance with you any day and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner
besides roderick captain bests a man and you are only a boy and you havent a guinea in the world
if ever i meet him again you shall see which is the best man of the two
ill fight him with sword or with pistol captain as he is
but captain best is already known as a valiant soldier and is famous as a man of fashion in london
it is mighty well of you to fight farmers boys but to fight an englishman is a very different matter
roderick falls silent
they come to an old high bridge over a stream sufficiently deep and rocky
suppose now roderick you who are such a hero was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side
id draw my sword and cut my way through them
what with me on the pillion
would you kill poor me
well then ill tell you what id do
id jump daisy into the river and swim you both across where no enemy could follow us
jump twenty feet
you wouldnt dare to do any such thing on daisy
theres the captains horse black george ive heard say that captain bes she never finished the word for maddened by the continual recurrence of that odious monosyllable roderick shouts hold
tight to my waist
and giving daisy the spur springs with dorothy over the parapet into the deeper water below
the horses head sinks under the girl screams as she sinks and screams as she rises
roderick lands her half fainting on the shore
various cuts showing illness and convalescence
roderick feverish the doctor taking his pulse
mother brings a tray of food
i went home and was ill speedily of a fever which kept me to my bed for a week
dorothy visiting him
dorothy visited me only once but i quitted my couch still more violently in love than i had been ever before
the air is fresh and bright and the birds sing loud amidst the green trees
roderick is elated and springs down the road as brisk as a young fawn
he encounters an orderly whistling roast beef of old england as he cleans down a cavalry horse
whose horse fellow is that
the horse belongs to my captain and hes a better fellow nor you any day
i did not stop to break his bones as i would on another occasion for a horrible suspicion had come across me and i made for the garden as quickly
as i could
roderick see captain best and dorothy pacing the path together
her arm is under his and he is fondling and squeezing her little hand which lies closely nestling against his arm
some distance beyond them is captain grogan who is paying court to dorothys sister mysie
the fact is that during the week of my illness no other than captain best was staying at castle dugan and making love to miss dorothy in form
no dorothy except for you and four others i vow before all the gods my heart had never felt the soft flame
ah you men you men john your passion is not equal to ours
we are like like some plant ive read of we bear but one flower and then we die
do you mean you never felt an inclination for another
never my john but for thee
how can you ask me such a question
raising her hand to his lips
roderick rushes into view drawing his little sword
i pulled out a knot of cherry colored ribbons which she had given me out of her breast and which somehow i always wore upon me and flung them in
captain bests face and rushed out with my little sword drawn
shes a liar shes a liar captain best
draw sir and defend yourself if you are a man
roderick leaps at captain best and collars him while dorothy makes the air echo with her screams
captain grogan and mysie hasten up
though roderick is a full growth of six feet he is small by the side of the enormous english captain
best turns very red at the attack upon him and slips back clutching at his sword
dorothy in an agony of terror flings herself round him screaming captain best for heavens sake spare the child he is but an infant
and ought to be whipped for his impudence but never fear miss dugan i shall not touch him your favorite is safe from me
so saying he stoops down and picks up the bunch of ribbons which roderick had flung at dorothys feet and handing it to her says in a sarcastic tone when
ladies make presents to gentlemen it is time for other gentlemen to retire
good heavens best
he is but a boy and dont signify any more than my parrot or lap dog
maynt i give a bit of ribbon to my own cousin
roaring im a man and will prove it
you are perfectly welcome miss as many yards as you like
your father was a tailor and you are always thinking of the shop
but ill have my revenge i will
roddy will you see me insulted
indeed miss dorothy i intend to have his blood as sure as my names roderick
ill send for the usher to cane you little boy but as for you miss i have the honor to wish you a good day
best takes off his hat with much ceremony and makes a low bow and is just walking off when michael rodericks cousin comes up whose ear has likewise been caught
by the scream
john best whats the matter here
ill tell you what it is mr
i have had enough of miss dugan here and your irish ways
i aint used to em sir
good humoredly well well
what is it
well make you used to our ways or adopt english ones
its not the english way for ladies to have two lovers and so mr
dugan ill thank you to pay me the sum you owe me and i resign all claims to this young lady
if she has a fancy for school boys let her take em sir
best you are joking
i never was more in earnest
in a towering rage you you
hang you for a meddling brat your hand is in everybodys pie
what business had you to come brawling and quarreling here with a gentleman who has fifteen hundred a year
michael runs after best
gasps oh i shall die i know i shall
i shall never leave this spot
whisper to dorothy the captain is gone
dorothy giving him an indignant look jumps up and walks towards the house
in a soothing tone to roderick this is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family
shouts after michael the man that marries dorothy dugan must first kill me do you mind that
shouting back from a distance pooh sir
kill you flog you you mean
ill send for nick the huntsman to do it
you are a gallant lad and i like your spirit
but what dugan says is true
its a hard thing to give a lad counsel who is in such a far gone state as you but believe me i know the world and if you will
but follow my advice you wont regret having taken it
dorothy dugan has not a penny you are not a whit richer
and my poor boy dont you see though its a hard matter to see that shes a flirt and does not care a pin for you or best either
dorothy might love me or not as she likes but best will have to fight me before he marries her
faith i think you are a lad thats likely to keep your word
he looks hard at roderick for a second to two then he walks away humming a tune looking back at roderick as he goes through the old gate out of
when grogan is gone roderick is quite alone and he flings himself down on the bench where dorothy had made believe to faint and had left her handkerchief and the
ribbons and taking them up hides his face in them and bursts into a passion of tears
i must have sat for some hours bemoaning myself on the garden bench for the dinner bell clanged as usual at three oclock which wakened me from my reverie
as roderick passes the courtyard he sees the captains saddle still hanging up at the stable door and his odious red coated brute of a servant swaggering with the scullion
girls and kitchen people
the englishmans still there master roderick
hes there in the parlor
go in and dont let im browbeat you master roderick
roderick enters and takes his place at the bottom of the big table the butler speedily brings him a cover
hello roddy my boy
up and well
hed better be home with his mother
dont mind her
its the cold goose she ate for breakfast didnt agree with her
take a glass of spirits mrs
dugan to rodericks health
it is evident that his uncle doesnt know of what happened but michael who is at dinner too and harry and almost all the girls look exceedingly black and the
captain foolish and miss dorothy who is again by his side ready to cry
captain grogan sits smiling and roderick looks on as cold as stone
his uncle is in high good humor
dorothy divide that merry thought with the captain
see wholl be married first
jack best my dear boy never mind a clean glass for the claret were short of crystal at castle dugan take dorothys and the wine will taste none the worse
dugan and ladies if you please this is a sort of toast that is drunk a great deal too seldom in my family and youll please to receive it with
all the honors
heres to captain and mrs
john best and long life to them
kiss her jack you rogue for faith youve got a treasure
spring up his already
hold your tongue you fool hold your tongue
shouting he has already been slapped in the face this morning captain john best hes already been called a coward captain john best and this is the way ill drink
heres your health captain john best
roderick flings a glass of claret into his face
the next moment he is under the table tripped up by harry who hits him a violent cuff on the head as he goes down he hardly has time to
hear the general screaming and scurrying that is taking place above him being so fully occupied with kicks and thumps and curses with which harry is belaboring him
you great blundering marplot you silly beggarly brat a thump at each hold your tongue
when roderick gets up from under the table the ladies are all gone but he has the satisfaction of seeing the captains nose is bleeding as his is best is
cut across the bridge and his beauty spoiled forever
in heavens name what does all the row mean
is the boy in fever again
turning to his father the fact is sir that the young monkey has fallen in love with dorothy and finding her and the captain mighty sweet in the garden today
he was for murdering jack best
bristling up and ill tell you what mr
dugan ive been insulted grossly in this house
i aint at all satisfied with these here ways of going on
im an englishman i am and a man of property and i i if youre insulted and not satisfied remember theres two of us best
on which the captain falls to washing his nose in water and answering never a word
in dignified tone mr
best may also have satisfaction any time he pleases by calling on roderick james esquire of jamesville
his uncle bursts out laughing and in this laugh captain grogan joins
captain grogan i beg you to understand that for my cousin harry who has been my best friend through life i could put up with rough treatment from him yet
even that sort of treatment i will bear from him no longer and any other person who ventures on the like will not like the cost
best knows that fact very well and if hes man hell know where to find me
it is getting late and your mother will be anxious about you
one of you had better go home with him
turning to his sons or the lad may be playing more pranks
both of us ride home with best here
im not afraid of highwaymen
my man is armed and so am i
you know the use of arms very well best and no one can doubt your courage but michael and i will see you home for all that
why youll not be home till morning boys
kilwangans a good ten miles from here
well sleep in bests quarters
were going to stop a week there
and in another week my boy
and here harry whispers something in the captains ear
ill go home with the boy
grogan walks with roderick
a pretty days work of it you have made master roderick
knowing your uncle to be distressed for money and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a year into the family
best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so
he takes a girl without a penny a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past and missing them
all and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father
and so i am
and this is the return you make for his kindness
didnt he harbor you in his house when your father died and hasnt he given you and your mother rent free your fine house of jamesville yonder
mark this come what will of it i swear i will fight the man who pretends to the hand of dorothy dugan
ill follow him if its into the church and meet him there
ill have his blood or he shall have mine
will you take my message to him and arrange the meeting
well if it must be it must
for a young fellow you are the most bloodthirsty i ever saw
no officer bearing his majestys commission can receive a glass of wine on his nose without resenting it fight you must and best is a huge strong fellow
hell give the better mark
i am not afraid of him
in faith i believe you are not for a lad i never saw more game in my life
give me a kiss my dear boy
youre after my own soul
as long as jack grogan lives you shall never want a friend or a second
he was shot six months afterwards at minden and i lost thereby a kind friend
but we dont know what is in store for us and thats a blessing
mother greeting roderick and captain grogan
in spite of my precautions to secrecy i half suspected that my mother knew all from the manner in which she embraced me on my arrival and received our guest
his mother looks a little anxious and flushed and every now and then gazes very hard into the captains face
but she would not say a word about the quarrel for she had a noble spirit and would as lief have seen any one of her kindred hanged as shirking
from the field of honor
roderick waking up
i never slept sounder in my life though i woke a little earlier than usual and you may be sure my first thought was of the event of the day
for which i was fully prepared
roderick at table with paper and ink
and now i sat down and wrote a couple of letters they might be the last thought i that i should ever write in my life
see him write dearest mother
then i went down to breakfast where my mother was waiting for me you may be sure
we did not say a single word about what was taking place
roderick eats his breakfast with a good appetite but in helping himself to salt spills it on which his mother starts up with a scream
thank god its fallen towards me
and then her heart being too full she leaves the room
they have their faults those mothers but are there any other women like them
there is an elegant silver mounted sword that hangs on the mantelpiece under the picture of rodericks late father
a pair of pistols hang on each side of the picture
roderick takes down the sword and pistols which are bright and well oiled and collects flints balls and gunpowder
captain grogan and orderly arrive
have you taken my message to him
the meeting is arranged
captain best is waiting for you now
my mare is saddled and ready whos the captains second
your cousins go out with him
roderick and grogan and the orderly ride off
i didnt take leave of mrs
the curtains of her bedroom windows were down and they didnt move as we mounted and trotted off
they ride their horses at a leisurely pace
thats a very handsome sword you have there
it was with this sword that my late father harry james god rest his soul met sir huddelstone fuddelstone the hampshire baronet and was fatally run through the neck
he was quite in the wrong having insulted lady fuddelstone when in liquor at the brentford assembly
but like a gentleman he scorned to apologize
and now you risk the same fate
if you are killed your mother is all alone in the world
i am harry james son and will act as becomes my name and quality
harry michael and the captain are already there
best flaming in red regimentals a big a monster as ever led a grenadier company
the party are laughing together
to captain grogan i hope to spoil this sport and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bullys body
oh its with pistols we fight
you are no match for best with the sword
ill match any man with the sword
but swords are today impossible captain best is is lame
he knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night as he was riding home and can scarce move it now
not against castle dugan gate that has been off the hinges these ten years
it must have been some other gate
they alight from their horses and join and salute the other gentlemen
i have just explained to mister james that captain best is lame and that swords are impossible
harry comes up to shake roderick by the hand while captain best takes off his hat and turns extremely red
and very lucky for you roderick my boy
you were a dead man else for he is a devil of a fellow isnt he grogan
a regular turk
i never yet knew the man who stood to captain best
hang the business
i hate it
im ashamed of it
say youre sorry roderick
you can easily say that
if the young feller will go to dublin as proposed
im not sorry ill not apologize and ill as soon go to dublin as to hell
grogan takes him aside
look here roderick my boy this is silly business
the girl will marry best mark my words and as sure as she does youll forget her
you are but a boy
best is willing to consider you as such
dublins a fine place and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month here are twenty guineas at your service
make best an apology and be off
a man of honor dies but never apologizes
ill see the captain hanged before i apologize
with a laugh to grogan theres nothing else for it
take your ground grogan twelve paces i suppose
in a big voice ten sir and make them short ones do you hear captain grogan
dont bully mr
here are the pistols
with some emotion to roderick god bless you my boy and when i count three fire
this is not one of my pistols
they are all right never fear
its one of mine
yours will serve if they are needed for the next round
roderick fire at his neck hit him there under the gorget see how the fool shows himself open
michael who has not spoken a word harry and the captain retire to one side and harry gives the signal
it is slowly given and roderick has the leisure to cover his man well
captain best changes color and trembles as the numbers are given
at three both pistols go off
best gives a most horrible groan staggers backwards and falls
crying out hes down
running towards him harry lifts him up michael takes his head
hes hit here in the neck
laying open his coat blood is seen gurgling from under his gorget
how is it with you
the unfortunate man does not answer but when the support of harrys arm is withdrawn from his back groans once more and falls backwards
with a scowl the young fellow has begun well
you had better ride off young sir before the police are up
they had wind of the business before we left kilwangan
is he quite dead
then the worlds rid of a coward
its all over with him roddy he doesnt stir
he gives the huge prostrate body a scornful kick with his foot
we are not cowards grogan whatever he was
lets get the boy off as quick as we may
your man shall go for a cart and take away the body of this unhappy gentleman
this has been a sad days work for our family roderick james and you have robbed us of fifteen hundred a year
it was dorothy did it
roderick takes the ribbons she gave him out of his waistcoat and the letter and flings them down on the body of captain best
take her those ribbons
shell know what they mean thats all thats left of her of two lovers she had and ruined
and now in heavens name get the youngster out of the way
ill go with you
they mount up and gallop off
upon seeing roderick and harry ride up his mother who has been waiting outside rushes to her son with wild screams of joy
he dismounts and she kisses and embraces him
i need not tell you how great was my mothers pride and exultation when she heard from harrys lips the account of my behavior at the duel
still much excitement and hustle and bustle
the boy must go into hiding for a short time anyway
dublin is the best place for him to go and there wait until matters are blown over
but the poor lad has never been away from home
he will be as safe here as in dublin
i wish that were true auntie dear but im afraid the bailiffs may already be on their way from kilwangan
his mother is rushing about and packing a valise
harry sits on the bed
harry persisted in the necessity of instant departure in which argument as i was anxious to see the world i must confess i sided with him and my mother was
brought to see that in our small house in the midst of a village escape would be impossible and capture would be impossible to avoid
his mother takes out a stocking from her escritoire and gives roderick twenty golden guineas
gravely roderick my darling my wild boy i have forebodings that our separation is to be a long one
i spent most of all night consulting the cards regarding your fate in the duel and all signs betoke a separation
here is twenty guineas all that i have in the world and i want you to keep your fathers sword and pistols which you have known to use so like
she hurried my departure now though her heart i know was full and almost in half an hour from my arrival at home i was once more on the road
again with the wide world as it were before me
his mother cries
no lad of seventeen is very sad who has liberty for the first time and twenty guineas in his pocket and i rode away thinking i confess not so much
of the kind of mother left alone and of the home behind me as of tomorrow and all the wonders it would bring
roderick happily riding down the road
i had no doubts of the future thinking that a man of my person parts and courage could make his way anywhere
so i rode on singing to myself or chatting with the passersby and all the girls along the road said god save me for a clever gentleman
farm girls in the fields flirting with him
as for thoughts of dorothy dugan there seemed to be a gap of a half a score of years
a well armed gentleman dressed in green and a gold cord with a patch on his eye and riding a powerful mare puts his horse alongside
good day to you young sir
where are you bound for
after a long look at his companion that is none of your business
is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel
pulling out a pistol not at all sir
i have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution and are ready to do it again
at this a pock marked man coming up the well armed gentleman spurs into his bay mare and leaves roderick
a little later on as i rode towards kilcullen i saw a crowd of peasant people assembled round a one horse chair and my friend in green as i thought
making off half a mile up the hill
a footman howls at the top of his voice
but the country fellows only laugh at his distress and make all sorts of jokes at the adventure which had just befallen
sure you might have kept him off with your blunderbush
o the coward
to let the captain bate you and he only one eye
the next time my lady travels shed better leave you at home
what is this noise fellows
roderick rides up amongst them and seeing the lady in the carriage very pale and frightened gives a slash of his whip and bids the red shanked ruffians keep off
pulling off his hat and bringing his mare up in a prance to the chair window
what has happened madam to annoy your ladyship
oh i am grateful to you sir
i am the wife of captain oreilly hastening to join him at dublin
my chair was stopped by a highwayman this great oaf of a servant man fell down on his knees armed as he was and though there were thirty people in
the next field working when the ruffian attacked not one of them would help but on the contrary wished him good luck
sure hes the friend of the poor and good luck to him
was it any business of ours
shouting be off to your work you pack of rascals or you will have a good taste of my thong
oreilly have you lost much
everything my purse containing upwards of a hundred guineas my jewels my snuff boxes watches
and all because this blundering coward fell to his knees
be fair maam them wasnt so much
didnt he return you the thirteen pence in copper and the watch saying it was only pinchbeck
dont be insolent or ill report you to the captain
he shuffles a few steps away and frowns in the direction that the captain has vanished
that fool didnt know what was the meaning of a hundred pound bill which was in the pocket book that the fellow took from me
i am riding to dublin myself and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you i shall do my best to protect you from further mishap
but i shouldnt like to put you to such trouble mister
they stop at the inn
very gallantly as you have been robbed of your purse may i have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur
before reaching your home
smiling thats very kind of you mr
he gives her two gold pieces
roderick and mrs
oreilly finishing their meal
we will hear dialogue underneath rodericks voice over
how different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at kilwangan assemblies
in every sentence she mentioned a lord or a person of quality
to the ladys question about my birth and parentage i replied that i was a young gentleman of large fortune that i was going to dublin for my studies and
that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum
you must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in dublin where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound
i hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house where captain oreilly will welcome with delight my gallant young preserver
paying the bill
perhaps had i been a little older in the worlds experience i should have begun to see that madame oreilly was not the person of fashion she pretended to be
but as it was i took all her stories for truth and when the landlord brought the bill for dinner paid it with the air of a lord
indeed she made no motion to produce the two pieces i had lent her
they ride by
and so we rode on slowly towards dublin into which city we made our entrance at nightfall
the rattle and splendor of the coaches the flare of the linkboys the number and magnificence of the houses struck me with the greatest wonder though i was careful to
disguise this feeling
we stopped at length at a house of rather mean appearance and were let into a passage which had a great smell of supper and punch
captain oreilly a stout red faced man without a periwig and in a rather tattered nightgown and cap
roderick and mrs
ohiggins i cannot say how grateful i am for your timely assistance to my wife
i am only sorry that i was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyships money and pearls
ohiggins we are in your debt and rest assured sir you have friends in this house whenever you are in dublin
pours a glass mister ohiggins i wonder if i know your good father
which ohiggins do you know
for i have never heard your name mentioned in my family
oh i am thinking of the ohiggins of redmondstown
general ohiggins was a close friend of my wifes dear father colonel granby somerset
ah i see
no im afraid mine are the ohiggins of watertown
i have heard of them
there are relics of some mutton chops and onions on a cracked dish before them
my love i wish i had known of your coming for bob moriaty and i just finished the most delicious venison pasty which his grace the lord lieutenant sent us
with a flash of sillery from his own cellar
you know the wine my dear
but as bygones are bygones and no help for them what say ye to a fine lobster and a bottle of as good claret as any in ireland
betty clear these things from the table and make the mistress and our young friend welcome to our home
captain oreilly searches his pockets for some money to give to betty
im sorry mr
ohiggins but i dont seem to have any small change
may i borrow a ten penny piece to give to the girl
i have some money my dear
here betty go to the fishmonger and bring back our supper and mind you get the right change
she takes out one of the golden guineas roderick gave to her
they are eating
our supper was seasoned if not by any great elegance at least by a plentiful store of anecdotes concerning the highest personages of the city with whom according to himself
the captain lived on terms of the utmost intimacy
not to be behind hand with him i spoke of my own estates and property as if i was as rich as a duke
the couple wishing roderick goodnight
had i been an english lad the appearance of the chamber i occupied might indeed have aroused instantly my suspicion and distrust
but we are not particular in ireland on the score of neatness hence the disorder of my bed chamber did not strike me so much
was there a lock to the door or a hasp to fasten it to
dress lying over bed
though my counterpane was evidently a greased brocade dress of mrs
and my cracked toilet glass not much bigger than a half crown yet i was used to these sort of ways in irish houses and still thought myself to be
in that of a man of fashion
drawers full of junk
there was no lock to the drawers which when they did open were full of my hostess rouge pots shoes stays and rags
in the middle of the night mrs
oreilly comes to rodericks room on a flimsy pretext and in the course of events he has his first woman
roderick captain and mrs
i neednt ask whether you had a comfortable bed
young fred pimpleton slept in it for seven months during which he did me the honor to stay with me and if he was satisfied i dont know who else
roderick captain and mrs
oreilly their friends
after breakfast we drove out to phoenix park where numbers of the young gentry were known to mrs
oreilly to all of whom she presented me in such a complimentary way that before half an hour i had got to be considered as a gentleman of great expectations
and large property
i had little notion then that i had got amongst a set of impostors that captain oreilly was only an adventurer and his lady a person of no credit
the fact was a young man could hardly have fallen into worse hands than those in which i now found myself
an evening of gambling
their friends were always welcome on payment of a certain moderate sum for their dinner after which you may be sure that cards were not wanting and that the company
who played did not play for love merely
various cuts of the characters present
what could happen to a man but misfortune from associating with such company
and in a very very short time i became their prey
roderick loses two hundred guineas to captain oreilly in a single hand
we see captain oreilly cheat but roderick does not
he pays him the gold guineas remaining from the sum his mother gave him
i shall have to write out a note for the rest of it captain oreilly
roderick exits to the street
the sound of the gambling can still be heard in the street
he is soon joined by councillor mulligan
master roderick you appear a young fellow of birth and fortune let me whisper in your ear that you have fallen into very bad hands its a regular gang of
swindlers and a gentleman of your rank and quality should never be seen in such company
the captain has been a gentlemans gentleman and his lady of no higher rank
go home pack your valise pay the little trifle you owe me mount your mare and ride back again to your parents its the very best thing you can do
roderick does not reply and walks slowly away from him down the street
into a pretty nest of villains indeed was i plunged
when i returned to my bed chamber a few hours later it seemed as if all my misfortunes were to break on me at once
valise open wardrobe lying on the ground and rodericks keys in the possession of oreilly and his wife
whom have i been harboring in my house
who are you sirrah
sirrah i am as good a gentleman as any in ireland
youre an impostor young man a schemer a deceiver
repeat the words again and i run you through the body
i can play at fencing as well as you mr
you change color do you
your secret is known is it
you come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the ohiggins of castle ohiggins i introduce you to the
nobility and gentry of this methropolis i take you to my tradesmen who give you credit
i accept your note for near two hundred pounds and what do i find
he holds up the name roderick james printed on the linen
not master ohiggins of watertown but roderick james of the devil only knows where
captain oreilly gathers up the linen clothes silver toilet articles and the rest of rodericks gear
hark ye mr
oreilly i will tell you why i was obliged to alter my name which is james and the best name in ireland
i changed it sir because on the day before i came to dublin i killed a man in deadly combat an englishman sir and a captain in his majestys service
and if you offer to let or hinder me in the slightest way the same arm which destroyed him is ready to punish you
so saying roderick draws his sword like lightning and giving a ha ha
and a stamp with his foot lunges it within an inch of oreillys heart who starts back and turns deadly pale while his wife with a scream flings herself between
dearest roderick be pacified
oreilly you dont want the poor childs blood
let him escape in heavens name let him go
sulkily he may go hang for me and hes better be off quickly for i shall go to the magistrate if i see him again
his wife sits down on the bed and begins to cry
roderick riding down the street with his valise
where was now a home for the descendant of the james
i was expelled from dublin by a persecution occasioned i must confess by my own imprudence
i had no time to wait and choose
no place of refuge to fly to
there was a score of recruiting parties in the town beating up for men to join our gallant armies in america and germany
roderick approaches a captain and a sergeant who quickly make him welcome
i will tell you frankly sir
i am a young gentleman in difficulties i have killed an officer in a duel and i am anxious to get out of the country
but i neednt have troubled myself with any explanations king george was in too much want of men to heed from whence they came and a fellow of my inches
was always welcome
indeed i could not have chosen my time better
a transport was lying at dunleary waiting for a wind
i never had a taste for any thing but genteel company and hate all descriptions of low life
hence my account of the society in which i at present found myself must of necessity be short
the reminiscences of the horrid black hole of a place in which we soldiers were confined of the wretched creatures with whom i was now forced to keep company of
the plowmen poachers pickpockets who had taken refuge from poverty or the law as in truth i had done myself is enough to make me ashamed even now
roderick sits very disconsolately over a platter of rancid bacon and moldy biscuit which is served to him at mess
when it comes to his turn to be helped to drink he is served like the rest with dirty tin noggin containing somewhat more than half a pint of rum
the beaker is so greasy and filthy that he cannot help turning round to the messman and saying fellow get me a glass
at which all the wretches round him burst into a roar of laughter the very loudest among them being mr
toole a red haired monster of a man
get the gentleman a towel for his hands and serve him a basin of turtle soup
roars the monster who is sitting or rather squatting on the deck opposite him and as he speaks he suddenly seizes rodericks beaker of grog and empties it in midst
of another burst of applause
whispers if you want to vex him ask him about his wife the washerwoman who bates him
is it a towel of your wifes washing mr
im told she wiped your face often with one
whispers ask him why he wouldnt see her yesterday when she came to the ship
and so i put to him some other foolish jokes about soapsuds hen pecking and flat irons which set the man into a fury and succeeded in raising a quarrel
roderick and toole fight with cudgels
roderick gives him a thump across his head which lays him lifeless on the floor
this victory over the cock of the vile dunghill obtained me respect among the wretches among whom i formed part
our passage was very favorable and in two days we landed at cuxhaven and before i had been a month in the electorate i was transported into a tall and
proper young soldier and having a natural aptitude for military exercise was soon as accomplished at the drill as the oldest sergeant in the regiment
roderick learning the soldierly arts musket drill manual of arms bayonet marching
the cuxhaven troops are drawn up to receive a new regiment arrived from england
roderick sees marching at the head of his company his old friend captain grogan who gives him a wink
six weeks after we arrived in cuxhaven we were reinforced by gales regiment of foot from england and i promise you the sight of grogans face was most welcome to
me for it assured me that a friend was near me
roderick and grogan
grogan gave me a wink of recognition but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters and
then shaking hands with me cordially gave me news which i wanted of my family
i had news of you in dublin
faith youve begun early like your fathers son but i think you could not do better than as you have done
but why did you not write home to your poor mother
she has sent half a dozen letters to you in dublin
i suppose she addressed them to me in my real name by which i never thought to ask for them at the post office
we must write to her today and you can tell her that you are safe and married to brown bess
roderick sighs when grogan says the word married on which grogan says with a laugh i see you are thinking of a certain young lady at duganstown
is miss dugan well
theres only six miss dugans now
has she died of grief
she took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband
she is now mrs
was there another mr
no the very same one my boy
he recovered from his wound
the ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him
it was only made of tow
do you think the dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a year out of the family
the plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way for the cowardly englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of
but hit him you certainly did roderick and with a fine thick plugget of tow and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to
we told your mother the story afterwards and a pretty scene she made
he has paid off your uncles mortgage
he gave dorothy a coach and six
that coward of a fellow has been making of your uncles family
faith the business was well done
your cousins michael and harry never let him out of their sight though he was for deserting to england until the marriage was completed and the happy couple off on
their road to dublin
are you in want of cash my boy
you may draw upon me for i got a couple of hundred out of master best for my share and while they last you shall never want
roderick on the march
our regiment which was quartered about stade and luneberg speedily had got orders to march southwards towards the rhine where we would fight the famous battle of minden
it would require a greater philosopher and historian than i am to explain the causes of the famous seven years war in which europe was engaged and indeed its origin
has always appeared to me to be so complicated and the books written about it so amazingly hard to understand that i have seldom been much wiser at the end of a chapter than at the beginning and so shall not trouble you with any personal disquisitions concerning the matter
various cuts featuring roderick marching cooking at open fires gambling resting in a farm yard officers riding by shivering in his blanket
roderick and his company
were these memoirs not characterized by truth i might easily make myself the hero of some strange and popular adventures
officers ride by in smoke
troops marching to the attack
but i saw no one of the higher ranks that day than my colonel and a couple of orderly officers riding by in the smoke no one on our side
a poor corporal is not generally invited into the company of commanders and the great
but in revenge i saw i promise you some very good company on the french part for their regiments of lorraine and royal cravate were charging us all day and
in the sort of melee high and low are pretty equally received
i hate bragging but i cannot help saying that i made a very close acquaintance with the colonel of the cravates
roderick firing his musket
he bayonets a french colonel amidst shouts and curses
and finished off a poor little ensign so young slender and small that a blow from my pigtail would have dispatched him
roderick kills a french ensign with a blows from the butt of his musket
and in the poor ensigns pocket found a purse of fourteen louis dor and a silver box of sugar plums of which the former present was very agreeable to me
roderick taking money and the box of sugar plums from the ensign
if people would tell their stories of battles in this simple way i think the cause of truth would not suffer by it
all i know of this famous fight of minden except from books is told here above
captain grogan is shot cries out and falls
a brother captain turns to lieutenant lakenham
grogans down lakenham theres your company
that was all the epitaph my brave patron got
roderick kneels above grogan
i should have left you a hundred guineas roderick but for a cursed run of ill luck last night at faro
he gives roderick a faint squeeze of the hand and as the word is given to advance roderick leaves him
when we came back to our ground which we presently did he was lying still but he was dead
some of our people had already torn off his epaulets and no doubt had rifled his purse
short cuts to voice over
roderick and british troops rape pillage and burn
after the death of my protector captain grogan i am forced to confess that i fell into the very worst of courses and company
in a foreign country with the enemy before us and the people continually under contribution from one side or the other numberless irregularities were permitted to the troops
it is well for gentlemen to talk of the age of chivalry but remember the starving brutes whom they lead men nursed in poverty entirely ignorant made to take pride
in deeds of blood men who can have no amusement but in drunkenness debauch and plunder
it is with these shocking instruments that your great warriors and kings have been doing their murderous work in the world
the year in which george ii died our regiment had the honor to be present at the battle of warburg where prince ferdinand once more completely defeated the frenchmen
lieutenant lakenham is shot falls and cries for help
during the action my lieutenant mr
lakenham of lakenham was struck by a musket ball in the side
he had shown no want of courage in this or any other occasion where he had been called upon to act against the french but this was his first wound
and the young gentleman was exceedingly frightened by it
here you roderick james
i will pay you five guineas if you will carry me into the town which is hard by those woods
roderick and another man take him up in a cloak and carry him towards the nearby town of warburg
in order to get into the house roderick and the other man are obliged to fire into the locks with their pieces which summons brings the inhabitants of the house
to the door a very pretty and black eyed young woman and her old half blinded father
they are at first unwilling to accommodate the guest but mr
lakenham speaking to them in german and taking a couple of guineas out of a very full purse speedily convinces the people that they have only to deal with a
person of honor
they carry lieutenant lakenham to bed and receive their five guineas
we put the patient to bed and he paid me the stipulated reward
a young surgeon who desired nothing better than to take himself out of the fire of the musketry came presently to dress the wound
in his german jargon roderick pays some deserved compliments to the black eyed beauty of warburg thinking with no small envy how comfortable it would be to be billeted there
he starts back to the regiment with his comrade when the man interrupts his reverie by suggesting they divide the five guineas
i should get half
your share is one guinea
roderick gives him one guinea
he gave you five guineas and i bloody well expect half
go to the devil
the private lifting his musket hits roderick a blow with the butt end of it which sends him stunned to the ground allowing his comrade to take the other four
guineas from his pocket
recovering his senses roderick bleeding with a large wound in the head has barely time to stagger back to the house where he had just left the lieutenant when he
falls fainting at the door just as the surgeon exits
roderick is carried by the surgeon and the black eyed girl into another bed in the room where the lieutenant has been laid
languidly in pain who are you putting into that bed
we have the corporal wounded to you bringing
turn him out
schicken sie herrn koporal weg
lischen brings roderick a refreshing drink and as he takes it he presses the kind hand that gave it to him nor does this token of his gratitude seem unwelcome
i found lischen the tenderest of nurses
whenever any delicacy was to be provided for the wounded lieutenant a share was always sent to the bed opposite his and to the avaricious mans no small annoyance
lischen serving food
various cuts representing different days
lakenham behaving as rottenly as roderick describes nor was i the only person in the house to whom the worthy gentleman was uncivil
he ordered the fair lischen hither and thither made impertinent love to her abused her soups quarreled with her omelettes and grudged the money which was laid out for his
maintenance so that our hostess detested him as much as i think without vanity as she regarded me
roderick making lover to lischen while lieutenant lakenham sulks in the next bed
for if truth must be told i had made very deep love to her during my stay under her roof as is always my way with women of whatever age
or degree of beauty
do not think me very cruel and heartless ladies this heart of lischens was like many a town which had been stormed and occupied several times before i came to
invest it roderick sitting up in bed
lischen has just served him his supper
enter a british officer an aide who carries a notebook and a surgeon
in a brief scene to be written we learn that a sudden movement on the part of the french requires the british army to follow them
the town is to be evacuated except for some prussian line of communication troops whose surgeons are to visit the wounded in the place and when they are well they
are to be drafted to their regiments
i began to reflect how pleasant my quarters were to me and that i was much better here than crawling under an odious tent with a parcel of tipsy soldiers
or going the night rounds or rising long before daybreak for drill
i determined that i never would join mine again
roderick stands by the window watching english troops and wagons leaving the town
roderick walks into lakenhams room attired in his full regimentals and with his hat cocked over his left eye
im promoted lieutenant
ive come to take my leave of you
i intend to have your papers and purse
you great scoundrel
you mutinous dog
what do you mean by dressing yourself in my regimentals
as sure as my names lakenham when we get back to the regiment ill have your soul cut out of your body
with this roderick puts his hand under his pillow at which lakenham gives a scream that might have called the whole garrison about his ears
roderick threatens him with a knife at his throat
hark ye sir
no more noise or you are a dead man
roderick taking his handkerchief binds it tight round his mouth and pulling forward the sleeves of his shirt ties them in a knot together and so leaves him removing the
papers and the purse and wishing him politely a good day
lischen waiting outside the house with a saddled horse throws her arms around him and makes the tenderest adieu
roderick mounts his newly purchased animal waves his hat gallantly and prances away down the street
roderick happily riding along a wooded country road rounds a blind bend and sees suddenly before him about two hundred yards away a company of prussian infantry resting along the
sides of the road together with a dozen mounted dragoons
a quick calculation tells him that is is better to proceed than to turn back and he rides into their midst approaching a group of officers
he presents himself as lieutenant lakenham and asks for directions to join his regiment
he is told that he is riding in the wrong direction and is shown a map
during the explanation captain galgenstein approaches with an open smiling countenance introduces himself and says he too is bound for the same place and asks if roderick will honor him
with his company
to avoid suspicion roderick readily accepts the offer and the two men mount up and ride off together
roderick and galgenstein riding together
dialogue under voice over
my companion treated me with great civility and asked me a thousand questions about england which i answered as best i might
but this best i am bound to say was bad enough
i knew nothing about england and i invented a thousand stories which i told him described the king and the ministers to him said the british ambassador in berlin was
my uncle and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him
what is your uncles name
with a laugh oh yes of course ambassador ogrady
roderick and captain galgenstein
their horses heads together jogging on
they pass a party of recruits under the armed guard of a red coated hanoverian sergeant
he exchanges signs of recognition with captain galgenstein
it hurts my feelings to be obliged to commune with such wretches but the stern necessities of war demand men continually and hence these recruiters whom you see market in
they get five and twenty thaler a man from our government for every man they bring in
for fine men for men like you
he adds laughing they would go as high as hundred
roderick and captain galgenstein approach a very lonely looking place
this is a very good inn
shall we stop for dinner
this may be a very good inn for germany but it would not pass in old ireland
corbach is only a league off let us push on for corbach
do you want to see the loveliest woman in europe
you sly rogue i see that will influence you
the place seems more a farm than an inn yard
the people are great farmers as well as inn keepers
they enter by a great gate into a court walled round and at on end of which is the building a dingy ruinous place
a couple of covered wagons are in the courtyard their horses are littered under a shed hard by
lounging about the place are some men and a pair of sergeants in the prussian uniform who both touch their hats to the captain
the inn has something foreboding about it and the men shut the great yard gates as soon as they enter
explaining the gate parties of french horsemen are about the country and one cannot take too many precautions against such villains
the two sergeant take charge of the horses the captain orders one of them to take rodericks valise to his bedroom
roderick promises the sergeant a glass of schnapps for his pains
they enter into supper
a dish of fried eggs and bacon is ordered from a hideous old wench that comes to serve them in place of the lovely creature which had been expected and
the captain laughing says well our meal is a frugal one but a soldier has many a time a worse
taking off his hat sword belt and gloves with great ceremony galgenstein sits down to eat
roderick puts his weapons securely on the old chest of drawers where the captains is laid
the hideous old woman brings in a pot of very sour wine at which and at her ugliness roderick feels a considerable ill humor
when she leaves wheres the beauty you promised me
laughing and looking hard at roderick it was my joke
i was tired and did not care to go farther
theres not prettier woman here than that
if she wont suit your fancy my friend then you must wait awhile
this increases rodericks ill humor
sternly upon my word sir i think you have acted very coolly
i have acted as i think fit
sir im a british officer
its a lie
youre a deserter
youre an impostor sir your lies and folly have confirmed this to me
you pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you dont know
will you join and take the bounty sir or will you be given up
springing at him like a tiger
but agile as he is galgenstein is equally on his guard
he takes two pistols out of his pockets fires one off and says from the other end of the table where he stands dodging roderick as it were
advance a step and i send this bullet into your brains
the door is flung open and the two sergeants enter armed with musket and bayonet to aid their captain
the game is up
roderick flings down a knife with which he had armed himself for the old hag on bringing in the wine had removed his sword
prussian troops on the march
roderick is now one of them
captain galgenstein rides by
at the close of the seven years war the prussian army so renowned for its disciplined valor was officered and under officered by native prussians it is true but was
composed for the most part of men hired or stolen like myself from almost every nation in europe
the deserting to and fro was prodigious
prussian punishment gauntlet
the life the private soldier led was a frightful one to any but the men of iron courage and endurance
the punishment was incessant
i was not near so unhappy in spite of all as i had been on my first enlisting in ireland
at least there will be no one of my acquaintance who will witness my shame and that is the point which i have always cared for most
rape pillage and burn
brief thematic repeat of british army version
i reasoned with myself thus now you are caught there is no use in repining make the best of your situation and get all the pleasure you can out of
there are a thousand opportunities of plunder offered to the soldier in war time out of which he can get both pleasure and profit make use of these and be
prussians against austrians or french or saxons
i do not intend to make a history of battles in the prussian any more than in the english service
i did my duty in them as well as another and there was not a braver cleverer handsomer and i must own wickeder soldier in the prussian army
i had formed myself to the condition of the proper fighting beast on a day of action i was savage and happy
roderick saves captain galgensteins life
roderick is decorated by colonel bulow for his heroism in saving captain galgenstein
colonel bulow gives roderick two frederic dor in front of the regiment
you are a gallant soldier and have evidently come of good stock but you are idle dissolute and unprincipled you have done a deal of harm to the men and
for all your talents and bravery i am sure you will come to no good
i hope colonel bulow is mistaken regarding my character
i have fallen into bad company it is true but i have only done as other soldiers have done and above all i have never had a kind friend and
protector before to whom i might show that i was worthy of better things
the colonel may say i am a ruined lad and send me to the devil but be sure of this i would go to the devil to serve the regiment
captain galgenstein looks pleased with rodericks performance
soon after the war ended our regiment was garrisoned in the capital the least dull perhaps of all the towns of prussia but that does not say much for its
roderick enters and approaches the captains sergeant
private roderick james
first hanoverian guards
captain galgenstein sent for me
you may wait
thank you sir
roderick stands stiffly
we can make out the sound of loud talking behind the closed door
enter a private huffing and puffing
sergeant the wagon has arrived with the captains furniture but the driver says he is not supposed to unload it
is it possible for you to talk to him
exit the sergeant muttering
roderick now alone in the office walks closer to the door so that he can hear what is being said
give him his discharge
you are a model of probity
youll never succeed to my place my dear nephew if you are no wiser than you are just now
make the fellow as useful to you as you please
you say he has a good manner and a frank countenance that he can lie with assurance and fight you say on a pinch
the scoundrel does not want for good qualities
as long as you have the regiment in terrorem over him you can do as you like with him
once let him loose and the lad is likely to give you the slip
keep on promising him promise to make him a general if you like
what the deuce do i care
there are spies enough to be had in this town without him
roderick hears the sergeant returning and walks back to the door
then the office door opens captain galgenstein looks out sees roderick smiles and say good morning private james
please come in
i should like you to meet my uncle herr minister of police galgenstein
how do you do sir
the minister nods
the captain was the nephew and heir of the minister of police herr galgenstein a relationship which no doubt aided in the younger gentlemens promotion
your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us
if you succeed depend on it your reward will be your discharge from the army and a bounty of guineas
what is the service sir
there is lately come to berlin a gentleman in the service of the empress queen who calls himself the chevalier de belle fast and wears the red riband and star
of the popes order of the spur
he is made for good society polished obliging a libertine without prejudices fond of women of good food of high play prudent and discreet
the captain smiles at roderick
he speaks italian and french indifferently but we have some reason to fancy this monsieur de belle fast is a native of your country of ireland and that he has
come here as a spy
the captain rises and begins to pace back and forth
naturally your knowledge of english makes you an ideal choice to go into his service
of course you will not know a word of english and if the chevalier asks as to the particularity of your accent say you are hungarian
the servant who came with him will be turned away today and the person to whom he has applied for a faithful fellow will recommend you
you are a hungarian you served in the army and left on account of weakness in the loins
he gambles a great deal and wins
do you know the cards well
only a very little as soldiers do
i had thought you more expert
you must find out if the chevalier cheats
he sees the english and austrian envoys continually and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house
find out what they talk of for how much each plays especially if any of them play on parole
if you are able to read his private letters though about those which go to the post you need not trouble yourself we look at them there
but never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes and by what channel or messenger
he sleeps with the keys of his dispatch box with a string around his neck twenty frederics if you get an impression of the keys
does this assignment interest you
yes minister i am interested in any work in which i can be of service to captain galgenstein
the minister studies roderick coldly
roderick now dressed in civilian clothes admires a beautiful carriage waiting at the door
then he enters
you are the young man who m
de seebach recommended
here is my letter
roderick bows and hands him a letter from that gentleman with which the captain had taken care to provide him
as the chevalier reads the letter roderick has the leisure to examine him
he is a man of sixty years of age dressed superbly wearing rings diamonds and laces
one of his eyes is closed with a black patch and he wears a little white and red paint and a pair of moustachios which fall over his lip
the chevalier is seated at a table near the window to read the letter
your name is lazlo zilagyi
you come highly recommended by herr seebach
herr seebach was a very kind employer
for whom else have you worked
no one sir
before that i served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins
who else can give me information about you
only the agency of servants
the chevalier puts the letter down looks at roderick for a few seconds and then smiles
you will do
i will give you
i do not provide your clothing you will sleep at home and you will be at my orders every morning at seven oclock
he notices roderick begin to tremble and look peculiar
is there something wrong
he goes up to roderick
it was very imprudent of me but when i saw the splendor of his appearance the nobleness of his manner i felt it impossible to keep disguise with him
you who have never been out of your country know little what it is to hear a friendly voice in captivity and theres a many a man that will understand
the cause of the burst of feeling which was about to take place
the chevalier takes roderick by the shoulder
as he speaks bursting into tears sir i have a confession to make
i am an irishman and my name is roderick james
i was abducted into the prussian army two years ago and now i have been put into your service by my captain and his uncle the minister of police to
serve as a watch upon your actions of which i am to give information to the same quarter
for this odious service i have been promised my discharge and a hundred guineas
sobbing roderick falls into his arms
they think to catch me do they
why young man my chief conspiracy is a faro bank
but the king is so jealous that he will see a spy in every person who comes to his miserable capital in the great sandy desert here
roderick and the chevalier walking
and i think he was as much affected as i was at thus finding one of his kindred for he too was an exile from home and a friendly voice
a look brought the old country back to his memory again and the old days of his boyhood
id give five years of my life to see the old country again the greenfields and the river and the old round tower and the burying place
roderick and the chevalier walking
my lad i have been in every service and between ourselves owe money in every capital in europe
i have been a rolling stone
play play has been my ruin
that and beauty
the women have made a fool of me my dear boy
i am a soft hearted creature and this minute at sixty two have no more command of myself than when peggy odwyer made a fool of me at sixteen
roderick and the chevalier walking along the bank
the cards are now my only livelihood
sometimes i am in luck and then i lay out my money in these trinkets you see
its property look you and the only way i have found of keeping a little about me
when the luck goes against me why my dear my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and i wear paste
do you understand the cards
i can play as soldiers do but have no great skill
we will practice in the mornings my boy and ill put you up to a thing or two worth knowing
quick cuts roderick being taught the profession of cards and the dice box
roderick minister galgenstein and captain galgenstein
i carried my little reports to captain galgenstein at the garden house outside the town where he gave me rendezvous
these reports of course were arranged between me and the chevalier beforehand
i was instructed and it is always the best way to tell as much truth as my story would possible bear
dialogue comes up from under voice over
he goes to church regularly he is very religious and after hearing mass comes home to breakfast
then he takes an airing in his chariot till dinner which is served at noon
after dinner he writes his letters if he has any letters to write but he has very little to do in this way
his letters are to the austrian envoy with whom he corresponds but who does not acknowledge him and being written in english or course i look over his shoulder
he generally writes for money
he makes his party with calsabigi the lottery contractor the russian attaches two from the english embassy my lords deuceace and punter who play a jeu denfer and a few
he wins often but not always
lord deuceace is a very fine player
the chevalier elliott the english minister sometimes comes on which occasion the secretaries do not play
the chevalier is at play against several gentlemen including the prince of turbingen while roderick signals the cards
it was agreed that i should keep my character of valet that in the presence of strangers i should not know a word of english that i should keep good
lookout on the trumps when i was serving the champagne and punch about and having a remarkably fine eyesight and a great natural aptitude i was speedily able to give my dear benefactor much assistance against his opponents at the green table
several cuts of playing and cheating to illustrate voice over
simplicity was our secret
everything successful is simple
if for instance i wiped the dust off a chair with my napkin it was to show that the enemy was strong in diamonds if i pushed it he had
an ace king if i said punch or wine my lord
hearts was meant
if wine or punch
if i blew my nose it was to indicate that there was another confederate employed by the adversary and then i warrant you some pretty trials of skill would take
the prince of turbingen although so young had a very great skill and cleverness with the cards in every way and it was only from hearing ritter von brandenburg who
came with him yawn three times when the chevalier had the ace of trumps that i knew we were greek to greek as it were
the prince loses a big hand and in a fury throws down his cards
he stares at the table then at the chevalier
chevalier though i cannot say how i believe you have cheated me
i deny your graces accusations and beg you to say how you have been cheated
glaring at roderick i dont know
your grace owes me seventy thousand frederics which i have honorably won
chevalier if you will have your money now you must fight for it
if you will be patient maybe i will pay you something another time
your grace if i am so tame as to take this then i must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation
i have said all there is to be said
i am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish
roderick captain galgenstein and minister galgenstein
was he cheated
in so far as i can tell these things no
i believe the chevalier won the money fairly
what are the chevaliers intentions
i am not sure
the prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money he would have to fight for it
a meeting with the prince of turbingen is impossible
the prince left him only that choice
the captain and the minister walk a few steps away and speak in whispers
then they return to roderick
will you be able to return here tomorrow without arousing suspicion
tell them i intend to demand satisfaction from the prince
but they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost
have no fear
it will come out well for me
i believe they will deport you
i have faced that problem before
but if they send you away then what is to become of me
with a smile make your mind easy you shall not be left behind i warrant you
do take a last look at your barracks make your mind easy say a farewell to your friends in berlin
the dear souls how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country and out of it you shall go
but how sir
roderick captain galgenstein and minister galgenstein
the king has determined to send the chevalier out of the country
when is he to go
has he sent the challenge yet
not yet but i believe he intends to
then this must be done tomorrow
what is to be done
you say he drives after breakfast and before dinner
when he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box and the coachman will get his orders to move on
and his baggage
that will be sent after him
i have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers you say and at noon after parade shall be at the inn
you will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair and will wait for me at the chevaliers rooms until my arrival
we must force that box
you are a clumsy hound or you would have got the key long ago
action as per voice over
at ten oclock the next morning the carriage of the chevalier de belle fast drew up as usual at the door of his hotel and the chevalier came down the
stairs in his usual stately manner
looking around and not finding his servant to open the door
where is my rascal lazlo
standing by the carriage i will let down the steps for your honor
no sooner does the chevalier enter than the officer jumps in after him another mounts the box by the coachman and the latter begins to drive
what is this
touching his hat you are going to drive to the frontier
it is shameful infamous
i insist upon being put down at the austrian ambassadors house
i have orders to gag your honor if you cry out and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not
but the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand
your honor must lower his voice
whispering all europe shall hear of this
as you please
both lapse into silence
the coach drives by
suddenly boom the alarm cannon begins to roar
do not be alarmed
the alarm cannon only signals a deserter
the coach drives by and action as described
hearing the sound of the alarm cannon the common people came out along the road with fowling pieces and pitch forks in hopes to catch the truant
the gendarmes looked very anxious to be on the lookout for him too
the price of a deserter was fifty crowns to those who brought him in
the black and white barriers came in view at last hard by bruck and opposite them the green and yellow of saxony
the saxon custom house officers came out
i have no luggage
the gentleman has nothing contraband
the prussian officers grinning hand the chevalier the purse and take their leave of their prisoner with much respect
the chevalier de belle fast gives them three frederic a piece
gentlemen i wish you a good day
will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning and tell my man there to send my baggage on to three kings at dresden
then ordering fresh horses the chevalier set off on his journey for that capital
i need not tell you that i was the chevalier
roderick reading a letter over his breakfast in bed
from the chevalier de belle fast to roderick james esquire gentilhomme anglais
at the hotel des trois couronnes dresden saxe
my dear roderick this comes to you by a sure hand no other than mr
lumpit of the english mission who is acquainted as all berlin will be directly with our wonderful story
they only know half as yet they only know that a deserter went off in my clothes and all are in admiration of your cleverness and valor
action as per description in letter
as i lay in my bed two and a half hours after your departure in comes your ex captain galgenstein
in his imperious dutch manner roderick
are you there
the rogue is gone out
action as per voice over
straightaway he makes for the red box where i keep my love letters my glass eye which i used to wear my two sets of paris teeth and my other
private matters that you know of
he first tries a bunch of keys but none of them fit the english lock
then he takes out of his pocket a chisel and hammer and falls to work like a professional burglar actually bursting open the little box
now was my time to act
i advance towards him armed with an immense water jug
i come noiselessly up to him just as he has broken the box and with all my might i deal him such a blow over the head as smashes the
water jug to bits and sends the captain with a snort lifeless to the ground
then i ring all the bells in the house and shout and swear and scream thieves
until the whole household comes tumbling up the stairs
where is my servant
who dares to rob me in open day
look at the villain whom i find in the act of breaking my chest open
send for the police send for his excellency the austrian minister
all europe shall know of this insult
we saw you go away three hours ago
why man i have been in bed all morning
i am ill i have taken physic i have not left the house this morning
where is that scoundrel lazlo
where are my clothes and wig
i have it i have it
lazlo is off in your honors dress
and my money my money
where is my purse with forty eight frederics in it
but we have one of the villains left officers seize him
more and more astonished its the young herr galgenstein
a gentleman breaking open my trunk with hammer and chisel impossible
herr galgenstein was returning to life by this time with a swelling on his skull as big as a saucepan and the officers carried him off and to make a
long story short poor galgenstein is now on his way to spandau and his uncle the minister of police galgenstein has brought me five hundred louis with a humble request that i would leave berlin forthwith and hush up this painful matter
roderick the chevalier and the duke of wurttemberg
the chevalier de belle fast was in particularly good order with the duke of wurttemberg whose court was at this period the most brilliant in all europe
the duke of wurttemberg chatting with ballet dancers who will perform at the party
he spent fabulous sums on the ballets and operas
all the ballerinas were pretty and they all boasted that they had all at least once made their amorous sovereign happy
roderick and the chevalier kissing hands hobnobbing with the nobility and dancing minuets
there was not a party of the nobility to which the two irish gentlemen were not invited and admired nor where we did not make the brave the high born
and the beautiful talk to us
there was no man in europe more gay in spirits more splendid in personal accomplishment than young roderick james
roderick and the chevalier in a comfortable coach on their way home to bed pass troops marching out on early parade
roderick sinks back into the comfortable cushion and yawns
what a delightful life did we now lead
i knew i was born a gentleman from the kindly way in which i took to the business as business certainly it is
roderick in a tub being washed by a servant
for though it seems all pleasure yet i assure any low bred persons who may chance to read this that we their betters have to work as well as they
though i did not rise until noon yet had i not been up at play until long past midnight
his hair being done
i came into it at once and as if i had never done anything else all my life
i had a gentleman to wait upon me a french friseur to dress my hair of a morning
a candle lit supper
i knew the taste of chocolate as by intuition almost and could distinguish between the right spanish and the french before i had been a week in my new position
action and cuts as voice over
i had rings on my fingers watches in both my fobs trinkets and snuff boxes of all sorts and each outvying the other in elegance
i had the finest natural taste for lace and china of any man i ever knew
i could judge a horse as well as any dealer in germany
i could not spell but i could speak german and french cleverly
roderick being fitted for clothes
i had at least twelve suits of clothes three richly embroidered with gold two laced with silver one of french grey silver laced and lined with chinchilla
i had damask morning robes to which a peacocks tail is as sober as a quakers drab skirt
action as voice over
i took lessons on the guitar and sang french catches exquisitely
where in fact was there a more accomplished gentleman than roderick james
action as per voice over
how have we had the best blood and the brightest eyes too of europe throbbing round the table as i and the chevalier have held the cards and the bank
against some terrible player who was matching some thousands out of his millions against our all which was there on the baize
roderick dealing a faro bank
our principles were play grandly honorably
be not of course cast down at losing but above all be not eager at winning as mean souls are
action as voice over
when the duke of courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags what did we ask
sir we have but eighty thousand florins in bank or two hundred thousand at three months if your highness bags do not contain more than eight thousand we will meet
and we did and after eleven hours play in which our bank was at one time reduced to two hundred and three ducats we won seventeen thousand florins off him
four crowned heads look on at the game and an imperial princess when roderick turns up the ace of hearts bursts into tears
roderick and a girl
nor need i mention my successes among the fairer portion of the creation
one of the most accomplished the tallest the most athletic and the handsomest gentleman in europe as i was then a young fellow of my figure could not fail of
having advantages which a person of my spirit knew very well how to us
making love to a masked lady
black eyed sczortarska
do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight
he brought me in his carriage and he will call for me at midnight
and he doesnt care about me
he is only curious to know who you are
if his love were like mine he would not permit you to come here
he loves me as i love you
will he wish to know the details of this night
he will believe that it will please me if he asks about it and i shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him
roderick takes from his portfolio a little jacket of very fine transparent skin eight inches long and closed at one end and which by way of a pouch string at
its open end has a narrow pink ribbon
he displays it to her she looks at it and laughs
i will put in on you myself
she puts it on out of shot
there you are dressed by my hand
it is nearly the same thing but despite the fineness and transparency of the skin the little fellow pleases me less well in costume
it seems that this covering degrades him or degrades me one of the other
both my angel
it was love who invented these little jackets for he had to ally himself with precaution
roderick making love to the countess von trotha
enter the count in the uniform of a colonel
i entered here monsieur at a bad moment for you it seems that you love this lady
certainly monseigneur does not your excellency consider her worthy of love
perfectly so and what is more i will tell you that i love her and that i am not of a humor to put up with rivals
now that i know it i will no longer love her
then you yield to me
on the instant
everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you
very well but a man who yields takes to his legs
that is a trifle strong
take to your legs low irish dog
roderick smiles at him
your excellency has wantonly insulted me
that being so i conclude that you hate me monseigneur and that hence you would be glad to remove me from the number of the living
in this wish i can and will satisfy your excellency
rodericks sword duel with the count
details to be worked out
roderick watches the chevalier play with a prussian officer lieutenant dascher
it was my unrivaled skill with sword and pistol and readiness to use them that maintained the reputation of the firm
towards the end of the game dascher seeing that he is losing makes an unfair stroke so obvious that the marker tells him so to his face
lieutenant dascher for whom the stroke wins the game takes the money which is in the stake bag and puts it in his pocket paying no attention to the markers
adjurations or to rodericks
roderick who is without his sword reaches for a billiard cue and swings it at daschers face
he wards off the blow with his arm drawing his sword and runs at roderick who is unarmed
the marker a sturdy young man catches dascher around the waist and prevents murder
i see that you are without your sword but i believe you are a man of mettle
will you give me satisfaction
i shall be delighted but you have lost and you must pay me the money before we meet for after all you cannot pay me when you are dead
i will undertake to pay you the louis but only tomorrow morning at the meeting
on the field there are six people waiting with dascher and his seconds
dascher takes louis from his pocket and hands them to roderick saying i may have been mistaken but i mean to make you pay deadly for your brutality
roderick takes the money and puts it in his purse with the utmost calm making no reply to the others boasting
privately it is distasteful to kill a scoundrel that should be work for a hangman
to risk ones life against such people is an imposition
laughs i risk nothing for i am certain to kill him
perfectly certain because i shall make him tremble
he takes his station between two trees about four paces apart and draws a pair of dueling pistols
you have only to pace yourself at ten paces difference and fire first
the space between these two trees is the place where i choose to walk back and forth
you may walk too if you wish when it is my turn to fire
no one could have explained his intentions more clearly or spoken more calmly
but we must decide who is to have the first shot
there is no need of that
i never fire first and in any case you have that right
dascher places himself at the specified distance
roderick walks slowly back and forth between the two trees without looking at him
dascher takes aim and fires missing
with the greatest composure you missed me sir
i was sure you would
the others think he is mad and had expected some kind of discussion between the parties but not a bit of it
dascher takes careful aim and fires a second shot again missing roderick
without a word but in a firm and confident manner roderick fires his first shot into the air
dascher looks amazed
then aiming at dascher with his second pistol he hits him in the center of the forehead and stretches him out dead on the ground
roderick and chevalier traveling in their coach
thus is will be seen that our life for all its splendor was one of extreme difficulty and danger requiring high talents and courage for success and sudden and unexpected
they meet a four wheel carriage drawn by two horses carrying a master and a servant
the driver of the four wheel carriage wants rodericks driver to make way for him
rodericks driver protests that if he does he will upset his master in the ditch but the other insists
roderick addresses the master a handsome young man and asks him to order his driver to make way for him
i am posting monsieur and furthermore i am a foreigner
monsieur here in saxony the post has no special right and if you are a foreigner you must admit that you have no greater claim than mine since i am
in my own country
at that roderick gets out and holding his drawn sword tells the stranger to get out or to make way for him
the stranger replies with a smile that he has no sword and that in any case he will not fight for such a silly reason
he tells roderick to get back in his chaise and he makes way for him
roderick and the chevalier running a faro bank when an important lady suffers a huge loss
the ladies were passionately fond of play and hence would often arise no small trouble to us for the truth most be told that the ladies loved to play but
not to pay
the point of honor is not understood by the charming sex and it was with the greatest difficulty that we could keep them from the table could get their money
if they lost or if they paid prevent them from using the most furious and extraordinary means of revenge
on this evening the lady of high rank after i had won a considerable sum in diamonds and pearls from her sent her lover with a band of cut throats
to waylay me
roderick and the chevalier are sound asleep in their carriage when they are awakened by a violent jolt upon which the carriage overturns in the middle of the road
the chevalier is underneath and screams from the pain in his right arm which he thinks is broken
their servant forces the door open to help them out telling them that the two postilions have fled
roderick easily gets out of the carriage through the door which is above him but the chevalier unable to move because of his disabled arm has to be pulled out
his piercing shrieks make roderick laugh because of the strange oaths with which he interlards his prayers
from the carriage roderick takes his dueling pistols and sword
roderick tells his servant to mount and to looking for armed peasants in the vicinity money in hand he leaves
the chevalier has lain down on the hard ground groaning and in no condition to resist robbers
roderick makes his own preparations to sell his fortune and his life at the highest price
his carriage is close to the ditch and he unhitches the horses tieing them to the wheels and the pole in a circle and stations himself behind them with weapons
in this predicament roderick cannot help laughing at the poor chevalier who is writhing like a dying dolphin on a seashore and uttering the most pitiful execrations when a mare
whose back was turned to him take it into her empty head to empty her bladder on him
there is nothing to be done he has to put up with the whole stinking rain and to forgive rodericks laughter which he has not the strength to hold in
the chill wind and the silence are suddenly broken by an attack which is half hearted and uncertain by the ladys lover and his hesitant band of six cut throats
some falter and run away as soon as roderick fires his pistol
the leader and two heartier followers engage roderick
during the fight they mortally wound the helpless chevalier and two of them are killed
after they flee roderick kneels by the chevalier who utters some appropriate last words then dies
his servant finally arrives at full gallop shouting at the top of his voice and followed by a band of peasants each with his lantern come to his rescue
there are ten or twelve of them all armed with muskets and all ready to obey his orders
rodericks carriage arrives
after making suitable arrangements for the chevaliers burial in proper accord with his church i traveled to spa which was now in season alone to continue my profession which formerly
had the support of my friend and mentor
crowds surround roderick
i was by this time one of the best known characters in europe and the fame of my exploits my duels my courage at play would bring crowds round me
in any public society where i appeared
attractive women alone while men are at the gaming table
the passion for play is stronger than the passion for gallantry the gamester at spa has neither time to stop to consider the merits of a woman nor the courage
to make sacrifices for her
the countess of cosgrove walks beside her husband sir william cosgrove who is in a wheelchair
they are accompanied by their young son lord brookside and two servants
in evoking the recollections of these days i have nothing but pleasure
i would if i could say as much of a lady who will henceforth play a considerable part in the drama of my life i mean the countess of cosgrove
whose fatal acquaintance i made at spa very soon after the tragic events which caused me to quit germany
closer shot of the countess
victoria countess of cosgrove
a countess and a viscountess in her own right
closer shot of sir william cosgrove
she was the wife of her cousin the right honorable sir william reginald cosgrove knight of the bath and minister to george ii and george iii of several of the
smaller courts of europe
closer shot of young lord brookside walking behind them in the care of his governor
she was the mother to viscount brookside a melancholy deserted little boy about whom his father was more than indifferent and whom his mother never saw
shots of sir william cosgrove being wheeled in and at play with roderick and some other gentlemen
i made sir william cosgroves acquaintance as usual at the play table
one could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime for though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases a cripple wheeled
about in a chair and suffering pangs of agony yet you would see him every morning and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth
hang it mr
roderick james you have no more manners than a barber and i think my black footman has been better educated than you but you are a young fellow of originality
and pluck and i like you sir
because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own
laughter at the table
i am obliged to observe sir william cosgrove that since you are bound for the next world much sooner than i am i will depend on you to get comfortable
quarters arranged for me
indeed you are right sir
look at me
marriage has added forty years to my life
i am dying a worn out cripple at the age of fifty
when i took off lady cosgrove there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself
fool that i was
i had enough with my pensions perfect freedom the best society in europe and i gave up all these and married and was miserable
take a warning from me mr
roderick and stick to the trumps
do anything but marry
would you have me spend my life all alone
in truth sir yes but if you must marry then marry a virtuous drudge
laughing the milkmaids daughter
well why not a milkmaids daughter
no man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wifes sake on the contrary if he selects the animal properly he will choose such
a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure but a comfort in his hours of annoyance
for instance i have got the gout who tends me
a hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power
my wife never comes near me
what friend have i
none in the wide world
men of the world as you and i are dont make friends and we are fools for our pains
polite laughter at the table
my lady is a weak woman but she is my mistress
she is a fool but she has got the better of one of the best heads in christendom
she is enormously rich but somehow i have never been so poor as since i married her
i thought to better myself and she has made me miserable and killed me and she will do as much for my successor when im gone
there is a reflective silence at the table
has her ladyship a very large income
this question causes sir william to burst out into a yelling laugh joined by the rest of the table and makes roderick blush not a little at his gaucherie
a beautiful scene lit by the flambeaux held by a dozen footmen
a small orchestra playing in a temple of love some dancers people gambling and lounging along a line of trees
roderick approaches the countess
despite my friends strong warning
i resolves to become acquainted with his lady
sir william cosgrove was dying
his widow would be a rich prize
why should i not win her and with her the means of making in the world that figure which my genius and inclination desired
when i determine i look upon the thing as done
charming lady tell me the truth and earn my gratitude
have you a lover
the countess laughs
have you had one
but for a time
a passing fancy
not even that
how can i believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you
have you not a man whom you value
that man has perhaps not yet been born
you have not met a man worthy of your attention
many worthy of attention but valuing is something more
i could value only someone whom i loved
then you have never loved
your heart is empty
your word empty makes me laugh
is it fortunate or unfortunate
if it is fortunate i congratulate myself
if it is unfortunate i do not care for i am not aware of it
it is nonetheless a misfortune and you will know it when you love
but if when i love i am unhappy i will know that my empty heart was my good fortune
that is true but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love
it is only too possible
love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult and it is even more difficult to make it last
i agree but god put us on earth to take that risk
a man may need to do that and find it amusing but a girl is bound by other laws
i believe you and i see i must hasten to leave for otherwise i shall become the unhappiest of men
by loving you with no hope of possessing you
you want my heart
it is my only object
to make me wretched in two weeks
to love you until death
to subscribe to all your commands
the amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing if it is true that you love me
deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me
if i do not know it i am innocent
but you deceive me nonetheless if i believe you for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer
roderick laughs and kisses her
be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are
with a woman who is completely charming be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition and who regardless of her rank will show me some kindness tonight
and if she does not choose to show you some kindness
then i will respectfully take leave of her
you will do as you please
it seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other
do you not agree
yes but i am afraid of being deceived
and for that reason you want to begin where people end
i ask only a payment on account today after that you will find me undemanding obedient and discreet
he kisses her again
coach and four moves slowly along
she gently struggles as he tries to undo her dress
will we always leave it at this
always my dear one never any further
love is a child to be pacified with trifles
a full diet can only kill it
i know better than you do
love wants a more substantial fare and if it is stubbornly withheld it withers away
our abstinence makes our love immortal
if i loved you a quarter of an hour ago now i should love you even more
but i should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires
let us give each other complete happiness and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires they will each time be born anew
my husband has convinced me of the contrary
sir william cosgrove is a man who is dying and yet i envy him more than any man in christendom
he enjoys a privilege of which i am deprived
he may take you in his arms whenever he pleases and no veil keeps his senses his eyes his soul from enjoying your beauty
she silences him with her fingertips
shall i tell you something i believed what was called love came after the union and i was surprised when my husband making me a woman made me know it
only by pain unaccompanied by any pleasure
i saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead
and so we became only friends seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other yet on good terms for a while as whenever he wanted me i was
at his service but since the offering was not seasoned with love he found it tasteless and seldom demanded it
o my dearest love
i beg you
stop believing in your experience
you have never known love
my very soul is leaving me
catch it on your lips and give me yours
they kiss ardently
to make a long story short her ladyship and i were in love six hours after we met and after i once got into her ladyships good graces i found
innumerable occasions to improve my intimacy and was scarcely ever out of her company
action as per voice over
i shall never forget the astonishment of sir william cosgrove when on one summer evening as he was issuing out to the play table in his sedan chair her ladyships
barouche and four came driving into the courtyard of the house which they inhabited and in that carriage by her ladyships side sat no other than the vulgar irish adventurer as she was pleased to call me
sir william makes the most courtly of bows and grins and waves his hat in as graceful a manner as his multiplicity of illness permits and her ladyship and roderick
reply to the salutation with the utmost politeness and elegance on their part
making ardent love
without you my dearest i might have died without ever knowing love
god of nature
bitterness than which nothing is sweeter sweetness than which nothing is more bitter
divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes
let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that i am happy
as soon as i saw you loved me i was pleased and i gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me being certain that for my part
i would never love you
but after our first kiss i found that i had no power over myself
i did not know that one kiss could matter so much
we then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that from time to time her ladyship cried out oh my god
is it true i am not dreaming
roderick enters and approaches a table at which sir william cosgrove who is drunk is at play with several other jovial fellows
sir william cosgrove with his complication of ills was dying before us by inches
he was continually tinkered up by doctors and what with my usual luck he might be restored to health and live i dont know how many years
if cosgrove would not die where was the use of my pursing his lady
but my fears were to prove groundless for on that very night patient nature would claim her account
good evening mr
james have you done with my lady
i beg your pardon
come come sir
i am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool
i think sir william cosgrove you have had too much drink
your chaplin mr
hunt has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter of which she is a considerable expert
sir william cosgrove greets this line with a yell of laughter
his laugh is not jovial or agreeable but rather painful and sardonic and ends in a violent fit of coughing
gentlemen see this amiable youth
he has been troubled by religious scruples and has flown for refuge to my chaplin mr
hunt who has asked for advise from my wife lady cosgrove and between them both they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith
did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple
faith sir if i want to learn good principles its surely better i should apply for them to your lady and your chaplin than to you
laughing but pretty red he wants to step into my shoes
he wants to step into my shoes
roderick stares at him coldly
well if my intentions are what you think they are if i do wish to step into your shoes what then
i have no other intentions than you had yourself
lady cosgroves wealth may be great but am i not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily
her rank is lofty but not so lofty as my ambition
i will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my lady cosgrove as you ever showed her and if i win her and wear her when you are
dead and gone corbleu knight do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me
is it not a pleasure gentlemen for me as i am drawing near the goal to find my home such a happy one my wife so fond of me that
she is even now thinking of appointing a successor
isnt it a comfort to see her like a prudent housewife getting everything ready for her husbands departure
i hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon knight
not so soon my dear as you may fancy perhaps
why man i have been given over many times these four years and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation
who knows how long i may keep you waiting
sir let those laugh that win
i am sorry for you mr
im grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting
had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic
what are the odds gentlemen that i dont live to see mr
james hang yet
there is laughter around the table and sir william starts dealing the cards
dies at spa in the kingdom of belgium the right honorable sir william cosgrove knight of the bath member of parliament for cosgrove and devonshire and many years his majestys
representative at various european courts
he hath left behind him a name which is endeared to all his friends for his manifold virtues and talents a reputation justly acquired in the service of his majesty
and an inconsolable widow to deplore his loss
sir williams keels over dead
the wedding of roderick and the countess
the service is preformed by reverend hunt her ladyships chaplain
a year from that day on the fifteenth of may in the year i had the honor and happiness to lead to the altar victoria countess of cosgrove widow of
the late right honorable sir william cosgrove k
i had procured his majestys gracious permission to add the name of my lovely lady to my own and henceforward assumed the title of james cosgrove
the wedding reception
roderick and the countess are approached by young lord brookside aged
my lord brookside come and embrace your papa
brookside walks slowly towards them and shakes his fist in rodericks face
he my father
i would as soon call one of your ladyships footmen papa
roderick laughs as the countess unsuccessfully tries to get the boy to shake hands
lord brookside you have offended your father
mother you have offended my father
it was a declaration of war to me as i saw at once though i declare i was willing enough to have lived with him on terms of friendliness
but as men serve me i serve them
who can blame me for my after quarrels with this young reprobate or lay upon my shoulders the evils which afterwards befell
three carriages each with four horses proceed along the picturesque track
after we had received the congratulations of our friends in london i and victoria set off to visit our country estate castle hackton where i had never as yet set
roderick and his lady
the first days of a marriage are commonly very trying and i have known couples who lived together like turtle doves for the rest of their lives peck each others
eyes out almost during the honeymoon
i did not escape the common lot
in our journey westwards my lady cosgrove chose to quarrel with me because i had pulled out a pipe of tobacco
lady cosgrove was a haughty woman and i hate pride and i promise you that in this instant i overcame this vice in her
roderick blows smoke into the countess face
she is shocked into an apprehensive silence
young lord brookside with his governor glowering and petulant
a parrot in a cage on his lap
as the carriages drive past there is a band floral arches flags church bells ringing
the parson and the farmers assemble in their best by the roadside and the school children and the laboring people are loud in their hurrahs for her ladyship
roderick flings pennies among the cheering tenants from two bags of coppers stored in the carriage for the occasion
fifty or so servants have turned out to greet their mistress and their new master
the land steward who is the senior servant introduces the others the clerk of the kitchen clerk of the stables head gardener ladies in waiting butler valet chef cook
i had not arrived at the pitch of prosperity and having at thirty years of age by my own merits and energy raised myself to one of the highest social
positions that any man in england could occupy i determined to enjoy myself as becomes a man of quality for the remainder of my life
roderick and his beautiful horses
roderick and some companions fishing
roderick and his friends riding
roderick and friends shooting
roderick having his portrait painted by a miniaturist
but it was not meant for me to finish my life as a man of quality and position
indeed i am one of those born clever enough at gaining a fortune but incapable of keeping one for the qualities and energy which lead a man to accept the
first are often the very causes of his ruin in the latter case indeed i know of no other reason for the misfortunes which finally befell me
at the end of the year lady cosgrove presented me with a son patrick cosgrove i called him in compliment to my royal ancestry but what more had i to
leave him than a noble name
two coaches pull up and the countess and roderick exit
servants remove their luggage and baby patrick
we spent the season in london at our house in berkeley square
the countess alone and depressed
her ladyship and i lived for a while pretty separate when in london
she preferred quiet or to say the truth i preferred it being a great friend to a modest tranquil behavior in woman and a taste for the domestic pleasures
several cuts of the countess caring for the infant patrick
besides she was a mother and had great comfort in the dressing educating and dandling of our little patrick for whose sake it was fit that she should give up
the pleasures and frivolities of the world so she left that part of the duty of every family of distinction to be performed by me
roderick arriving with a party of friends escorting a beautiful woman
countess crying and having an argument with roderick
live dialogue under voice over
her ladyships conversations with me were characterized by a stupid despair or a silly blundering attempt at forced cheerfulness still more disagreeable hence our intercourse was but trifling and my
temptations to carry her into the world or to remain in her society of necessity exceedingly small
a drunken roderick rudely demands his lady to entertain their guests
she rushes from the room in tears
dialogue starts scene goes under for voice over then ends scene
she would try my temper at home too in a thousand ways
when requested by me to entertain the company with conversation wit and learning of which she was a mistress or music of which she was an accomplished performer she would
as often as not begin to cry and leave the room
my company from this of course fancied i was a tyrant over her whereas i was only a severe and careful guardian of a silly bad tempered and weak minded
roderick strolling arm in arm with his countess
despite the utter distaste with which i now regarded lady cosgrove and although i took no particular pains to disguise my feelings in general yet she was of such a
mean spirit that she pursued me with her regard and would kindle up at the smallest kind word i spoke to her
roderick and accountant
her ladyship is signing various documents and orders for payment
and in these fits of love she was the most easy creature in the world to be persuaded and would have signed away her whole property had it been possible
and i must confess it was with very little attention on my part that i could bring her into good humor and up to the very last day of our
being together would be reconciled to me and fondle me if i addressed her a single kind word
such is female inconsistency
roderick and the countess fighting about her refusal to sign some papers
live dialogue under voice over
she was luckily very fond of her youngest son and through him i had a wholesome and effectual hold on her for if in any of her tantrums or fits
of haughtiness she pretended to have the upper hand to assert her authority against mine to refuse to sign such papers as i might think necessary for the distribution of our large and complicated property
roderick picks up baby patrick
i would have master patrick carried off to chiswick for a couple of days and i warrant me his lady mother could hold out no longer and would agree to
anything i proposed
the countess rushes to the window to see the child being put into a carriage
lady cosgrove and i did not quarrel more than fashionable people do and for the first three years i never struck my wife but when i was in liquor
roderick throws a knife at young brookside
the knife digs into an expensive antique chest just missing the young brooksides head
when i flung the carving knife at brookside i was drunk as everybody present can testify but as for having any systematic scheme against the poor lad i can declare
solemnly that beyond merely hating him i am guilty of no evil towards him
the countess discovers roderick making love to the childs nurse
do what one would to please her my lady would never be happy or in good humor
and soon she added a mean detestable jealousy to all her other faults and would weep and wring her hands and threaten to commit suicide and i know not what
she screams and shouts something about suicide
her son brookside comes running in and consoles her
her death would have been no comfort to me as i leave any person of common prudence to imagine for that scoundrel of a young brookside who was about to
become my greatest plague and annoyance would have inherited every penny of the property
roderick bored and distracted sits before a stack of bills and papers with his accountant
humble people envy us great men and fancy that our lives are all pleasure
but the troubles of poverty the rascality of agents the quibbles of lawyers are endless
my life at this period seemed to consist of nothing but drafts of letters and money brokers relative to the raising of money and the insuring of lady cosgroves life
and innumerable correspondence with upholsterers decorators cooks horsekeepers bailiffs and stewards
birthday fete for patrick who is now five years old
gaily colored tents ponies a puppet show expensive presents
my own dear boy patrick was now five years old and was the most polite and engaging child ever seen it was a pleasure to treat him with kindness and
distinction the little fellow was the pink of fashion beauty and good breeding
in fact he could not have been otherwise with the care both his parents bestowed upon him and the attentions which were lavished upon him in every way
brookside and roderick
whereas young brookside had grown to be a very nasty and disrespectful fellow indeed
in my company he preserved the most rigid silence and a haughty scornful demeanor which was so much the more disagreeable because there was nothing in his behavior i could
actually take hold of to find fault with although his whole conduct was insolent and supercilious to the highest degree
brookside sitting alone reading a book
in addition to this the lad was fond of spending the chief part of his time occupied with the musty old books which he took out of the library and
which i hate to see a young man of spirit pouring over
brookside and the countess
the insubordination of that boy was dreadful
he used to quote passages of hamlet to his mother which made her very angry
brookside quoting hamlet
the countess begins to cry and leaves the room
roderick caning young brookside
as it is best to nip vice in the bud and for a master of a family to exercise his authority in such a manner as that there may be
no question about it i took every opportunity of coming to close quarters with master brookside
many guests around the table
he always chose the days when company or the clergy or gentry of the neighborhood were present to make violent sarcastic and insolent speeches
brookside begins to fondle and caress patrick
dear child what a pity it is i am not dead for your sake
the cosgroves would then have a worthy representative and enjoy all the benefits of the illustrious blood of the james of duganstown would they not mr
roderick caning brookside again
the boy bears the punishment without crying
rodericks reunion with his mother
present are the countess patrick lord brookside and others
james flings herself into her sons arms with a scream and with transports of joy which can only be comprehended by women who have held in their arms an only
child after a twelve year absence from him
roderick and mother feeding patrick
roderick and mother playing with patrick in the garden
mother at dinner with the family in a strained atmosphere
roderick and his mother talk in whispers near the bed of the sleeping patrick
ah roderick its a blessing to see that my darling boy has attained a position i always knew was his due and for which i pinched myself to educate him
little patrick is a darling boy and you live in great splendor but how long will it last
your lady wife knows she has a treasure she couldnt have had had she taken a duke to marry her but if one day she should tire of my wild
roderick and his old fashioned irish ways or if she should die what future would there be for my son and grandson
roderick and his mother
you have not a penny of your own and cannot transact any business without the countess signature
upon her death the entire estate would go to young brookside who bears you little affection
you could be penniless tomorrow and darling patrick at the mercy of his stepbrother
roderick and his mother
i shall tell you a secret i shall not rest until i see you earl of duganstown and my grandson a lord viscount
she smooths down rodericks hair
this head would become a coronet
roderick and mother slowly walking and talking
young patrick ahead of them sitting in a small cart pulled by a lamb
these things entail considerable expense and you will need your ladys blessing but the young boy forms the great bond of union between you and her ladyship and there is
no plan of ambition you could propose in which she would not join for the poor lads benefit and no expense she will not eagerly incur if it might be any means be shown to tend to his advancement
you have important friends and they can tell you how these things are done
standing away from the play tables roderick chats with lord west a fat giant of a man
and to be sure i did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done and this was the distinguished solicitor and former government minister lord west whose acquaintance
i made as i had so many others at the gaming table
do you happen to know gustavus adolphus the thirteenth earl of crabs
by name only
well sir this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of his majestys closet and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy
i should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the viscounty which you propose to get
roderick having lunch with lord west and the earl of crabs
and for a five hundred guinea fee paid to his city law firm lord west kindly arranged a meeting with that old scamp and swindler gustavus adolphus the thirteenth earl
cosgrove when i take up a person he or she is safe
there is no question about them any more
my friends are the best people
i dont mean the most virtuous or indeed the least virtuous or the cleverest or the stupidest or the richest or the best born but the best in a word
people about whom there is no question
i cannot promise you how long it will take
you can appreciate it is not an easy matter
but any gentlemen with an estate and ten thousand a year should have a peerage
roderick being introduced to three noblemen including the duke of rutland
the striving after this peerage i consider to have been one of the most unlucky dealings at this period
i made unheard of sacrifices to bring it about
i can tell you bribes were administered and in high places too so near the royal person of his majesty that you would be astonished were i to mention what
great personages condescended to receive our loans
roderick gives a beautiful diamond to a fat princess on her birthday
he is applauded by the other guests
i lavished money here and diamonds there
roderick and the seller riding over a prospective property

i bought lands at ten times there value

i gave repeated entertainments to those friends to my claims who being about the royal person were likely to advance it

i purchased pictures and articles of vertu at ruinous prices
roderick laughing and paying a bet
i lost many a bet to the royal dukes his majestys brothers
reviewing the company of troops
roderick the earl of crabs the countess patrick and brookside several princes and noblemen and the duke of rutland
one of the main causes of expense which this ambition of mine entailed upon me was the fitting out and arming of a company of infantry from the hackton estates
which i offered to my gracious sovereign for the campaign against the american rebels
these troops superbly equipped and clothed were embarked at portsmouth in the year
george iii meeting people and stopping to talk to roderick
present also is the duke of rutland
and the patriotism of the gentlemen who raised them was so acceptable at court that on being presented by my lord crabs his majesty condescended to notice me particularly and
said thats right mr
cosgrove raise another company and go with them too
crabs was really one of the most entertaining fellows in the world and i took a sincere pleasure in his company besides the interest and desire i had in cultivating
the society of the most important personages of the realm
roderick clumsily tries to engage in conversation with the famed dr
johnson on the subject of a book or play of the day and is rebuffed for his trouble
if i were you mr
cosgrove i should mind my horses and tailors and not trouble myself about letters
laughter roderick bristles
johnson i think you misbehave most grossly treating my opinions with no more respect than those of a schoolboy
you fancy sir you know a great deal more than me because you quote your aristotle and plato but can you tell me which horse will win at epsom downs
can you shoot the ace of spades ten times without missing
if so talk about aristotle and plato with me
roars do you know who youre speaking to
hold your tongue mr
boswell i had no right to brag of my greek gentlemen and he has answered me very well
pleased do you know ever a rhyme for aristotle
laughing port if you please
waiter bring on of captain james rhymes for aristotle
and we had six rhymes for aristotle before we left the coffee house that evening
henri this is mr
james cosgrove who wishes to arrange a dinner party next week for sixty guests
i am at your service mr
how much do you wish to spend
as much as possible
as much as possible
yes for i wish to entertain splendidly
all the same you must name an amount
it is entirely up to you
i want the best
may i suggest five hundred guineas
will that be enough
last month the duke of suffolk spent no more
all right five hundred guineas
roderick is seated at a large table stacked high with bills and letters his accountant is seated next to him aided by a bookkeeper
roderick looks at each bill and his accountant explains the charge
the life i was leading was that of a happy man but i was not happy
roderick walking with big strides leads brookside by his ear
little patrick runs alongside pleading for his brother
papa please dont flog brookside today
it wasnt his fault really is wasnt
roderick ignores him
by now young brookside was of so wild savage and insubordinate a nature that i never had the least regard for him
as he grew up to be a man his hatred for me assumed an intensity quite wicked to think of and which i promise you i returned with interest
he drags brookside into his study slamming the door behind him
brookside enters with a pistol
grinding his teeth look you now mister roderick james from this moment on i will submit to no further chastisement from you
do you understand that
give me that pistol
take heed mister james
i will shoot you if you lay hands on me now or ever again
is that entirely clear to you sir
roderick stares hard at him then he laughs and sits down
i decided at once to give up that necessary part of his education
in truth he then became the most violent daring disobedient scapegrace that ever caused an affectionate parent pain he was certainly the most incorrigible
brookside smashing a chair over the head of his governor reverend hunt
twice or thrice reverend hunt attempted to punish my lord brookside but i promise you the rogue was too strong for him and leveled the oxford man to the ground
with a chair greatly to the delight of little patrick who cried out bravo brooksy
thump him thump him
brookside and patrick
with the child brookside was strange to say pretty tractable
he took a liking to the little fellow i like him the more he said because he was half a cosgrove
another day it was patricks birthday we were giving a grand ball and gala at hackton and it was time for my patrick to make his appearance among us
there is a great crowding and tittering as the child comes in led by his half brother who walks into the dancing room in his stockinged feet leading little patrick
by the hand paddling about in the great shoes of the older
very loudly dont you think he fits my shoes very well sir richard wargrave
upon which the company begins to look at each other and to titter and his mother comes up to lord brookside with great dignity seizes the child to her breast
and says from the manner in which i love this child my lord you ought to know how i would have loved his elder brother had he proved worthy of any mothers affection
brookside is stunned by his mothers words
madam i have borne as long as mortal could endure the ill treatment of the insolent irish upstart whom you have taken into your bed
it is not only the lowness of his birth and the general brutality of his manners which disgusts me but the shameful nature of his conduct towards your ladyship his
brutal and ungentlemanlike behavior his open infidelity his habits of extravagance intoxication his shameless robberies and swindling of my property and yours
it is these insults to you which shock and annoy me more than the ruffians infamous conduct to myself
i would have stood by your ladyship as i promised but you seem to have taken latterly your husbands part and as i cannot personally chastise this low bred ruffian
who to our shame be it spoken is the husband of my mother and as i cannot bear to witness his treatment of you and loathe his horrible society as if it were the plague i am determined to quit my native country at least during his detested life or during my own
bursting into tears lady cosgrove leaves the room
roderick loses control and rushes at brookside knocking down lords dukes and generals left and right who try to interfere
the company is scandalizes by the entire incident
action as per voice over
roderick is shunned
if i had murdered my lord i could scarcely have been received with more shameful obloquy and slander than now followed me in town and country
my friends fell away from me and a legend arose of my cruelty to my stepson
my reception at court was scarcely more cordial
on paying my respects to my sovereign at st
james his majesty pointedly asked me when i had news of lord brookside
on which i replied with no ordinary presence of mind sire my lord brookside has set sail to fight the rebels against your majestys crown in america
does your majesty desire that i should send another company to aid him
the king stares at roderick turns on his heel and quickly leaves the presence chamber
roderick is approached by the duke of rutland who takes him aside into an alcove
speaking very quietly let me tell you sir that your conduct has been very odiously represented to the king and has formed the subject of royal comment
the king has said influenced by these representations that you are the most disreputable man in the three kingdoms and a dishonor to your name and country
roderick begins to sputter
hear me out please
it has been intimated to his majesty that you had raised the american company for the sole purpose of getting the young viscount to command it and so get rid
and further that you had paid the very man in the company who was ordered to dispatch him in the first general action
thus it is that my loyalty is rewarded and my sacrifices in favor of my country viewed
as for your ambitious hopes regarding the irish peerages his majesty has also let it be known that you have been led astray by that lord crabs who likes to
take money but who has no more influence to get a coronet than to procure a popes tiara
and if you have it in mind to call upon lord crabs you will be disappointed
he left for the continent on tuesday and may be away for several months
roderick and lord west
i insist upon being allowed to appear before his majesty and clear myself of the imputations against me to point out my services to the government and to ask when
the reward that had been promised me the title held by my ancestors is again to be revived in my person
there is a sleepy coolness in the fat lord west
he hears roderick with half shut eyes
when he finishes his violent speech which he has made striding about the room lord west opens one eye smiles and says gently have you done mr
cosgrove ill answer you point by point
the king is exceedingly averse to make peers as you know
your claim as you call them have been laid before him and his majestys gracious reply was that you were the most impudent man in his dominions and merited a
halter rather than a coronet
as for withdrawing your support from us you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please
and now as i have a great deal of occupation perhaps you will do me the favor to retire or tell me if there is anything else in the world
in which i can oblige you
so saying lord west raises his hand lazily to the bell and bows roderick out
roderick and his accountant going over the bills which he has heaped on the table
the news of his majestys disregard were not long in getting around and in a very short time all the bills came down upon me together all the bills i
had been contracting for the years of my marriage
i wont cite their amount it was frightful
i was bound up in an inextricable toil of bills and debts or mortgages and insurances and all the horrible evils attendant upon them
roderick walking alone
was it my own want of style or my want of a fortune
i know not
now i was arrived at the height of my ambition but both my skill and my luck seemed to be deserting me
everything i touched crumbled in my hands every speculation i had failed every agent i trusted deceived me
my income was saddled with hundreds of annuities and thousands of lawyers charges and i felt the net drawing closer and closer around me and no means to extricate myself
from its toils
all my schemes had turned out failures
roderick at the gaming table
my wifes moody despondency made my house and home not over pleasant hence i was driven a good deal abroad where as play was the fashion in every club tavern
and assembly i of course was obliged to resume my old habit and to commence as an amateur those games at which i was once unrivaled in europe
roderick loses a large amount of money
i had a run of ill luck at play and was forced to meet my losses by the most shameful sacrifices to the money lenders and was compelled to borrow
largely upon my wifes annuities ensuring her ladyships life which was the condition for every loan against her property
roderick and the broker
your wifes life is as well known among the insurance societies in london as any woman in christendom and im sorry to say there is not one of them willing
to place another policy against her ladyships life
one of them even had the impudence to suggest that your treatment of the countess did not render her life worth a years purchase
roderick buying a horse
in the midst of my difficulties i promised to buy a little horse for my dear little patrick which was to be a present for his eighth birthday that was
now coming on
i may have had my faults but no man shall dare to say of me that i was not a good and tender father
roderick admires the horse
it was a beautiful little animal and stood me in a good sum
i never regarded money for that dear child
the horse kicks off one of the horse boys who tries to ride him
but the horse was a bit wild and he kicked off one of the horse boys who rode him at first and broke the lads leg
roderick riding the horse
the horse boy lies in the back of a wagon
but he was a beautiful animal and would make a fine horse for patrick after he had a bit of breaking in
roderick dismounts and gives the horse to one of the horse boys
timmy take the injured lad to see the doctor and then bring the horse to doolans farm and tell him to break him in thoroughly
tell him its for little patrick and that ill be over to see him next week
one more thing and listen well i dont want little patrick to know where the horse is being kept
its going to be surprise for his birthday
patrick rushes out to greet his father
roderick picks him up in his arms and kisses him
did you buy the horse papa
now just have a little patience my boy
your birthday isnt until next week
but i will have it on my birthday wont i
well well just have to wait and see wont we
he walks up the steps holding patrick who hugs and kisses him
my son little patrick cosgrove was a prince his breeding and manners even at his early age showed him to be worthy of the two noble families from whom he
was descended and i dont know what high hopes i had for the boy and indulged in a thousand fond anticipations as to his future success and figure in the world but stern fate had determined that i should leave none of my race behind me
roderick is drunk
patrick is brought in by his governor hunt to say good night
his kisses his mother first then approaches roderick
kissing him good night papa
good night my little darling
one of the boys in the stable told nelly that youve already bought my horse and that its at doolans farm where mick the groom is breaking it in
is that true papa
angered what the devil
what kind of fools do we have here
pottle who told the lad this story
i dont know sir
then its true
oh thank you papa
he hugs his father
promise me patrick that you will not ride the horse except in the company of your father
unconvincingly i promise mama
i promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to doolans farm to see him
roderick is awakened by his valet and hunt the governor
im sorry to disturb you sir but mr
hunt has something important to tell you
i think master patrick has disobeyed your orders and stolen off to doolans farm
when i went to the lads room this morning his bed was empty
one of the cooks said she saw him go away before daybreak
he must have slipped through my room while i was asleep
roderick in a rage taking a great horse whip gallops off after the child
roderick comes upon a sad procession of farmers moaning and howling the black horse led by the hand and on a door that some of them carry little patrick
he lies in his little boots and spurs and his little coat of scarlet and gold
his face is quite white and he smiles as he holds a hand out to roderick and says painfully you wont whip me will you papa
roderick bursts out into tears in reply
some doctors around the bed roderick and the countess anxiously waiting upon them
the doctors were called but what does a doctor avail in a contest with the grim invincible enemy
such as came could only confirm our despair by their account of the poor childs case
his spine was injured the lower half of him was dead when they laid him in bed at home
the rest did not last long god help me
he remained yet for two days with us and a sad comfort it was to think he was in no pain
roderick countess and patrick
weakly papa i beg you and mama to pardon me for any acts of disobedience i have been guilty of towards you
weeping oh my little angel you have done nothing for which you need pardon
where is brooksy
i would like to see him
your bother is in america fighting the rebels
is he all right papa
yes hes fine
brooksy was better than you papa he used not to swear so and he taught me many good things while you were away
patrick takes a hand of his mother and of roderick in each of his little clammy ones
i beg you not to quarrel so but to love each other so that we might meet again in heaven where brooksy told me quarrelsome people never go
his mother is much affected by these admonitions and roderick is too
patrick gives roderick a ring from his finger and a locket to his mother
he says that these gifts are so that they will not forget him
at last after two days he died
there he lay the hope of my family the pride of my manhood the link which kept me and my lady cosgrove together
i wont tell you with what splendor we buried him but what avail are undertakers feathers and heralds trumpery
roderick enters the stable and after a few seconds we hear a pistol shot
he exits rapidly the smoking pistol still in his hand
the countess praying
waking up screaming
fits of crying
lady cosgrove always vaporish and nervous after our blessed boys catastrophe became more agitated than ever and plunged into devotion with so much fervor that you would have fancied her
almost distracted at times
countess sees visions
she imagined she saw visions
she said an angel from heaven told her that patricks death was a punishment to her for her neglect of her firstborn
then she would declare that brookside was dead
roderick and his accountant
bills bills bills
by now my financial affairs were near to ruin
i could not get a guinea from any money dealer in london
our rents were in the hands of receivers by this time and it was as much as i could do to get enough money from the rascals to pay my
wine merchants their bills
our property was hampered and often as i applied to my lawyers and agents for money would come a reply demanding money of me for debts and pretended claims which
the rapacious rascals said they had on me
roderick greets her
servants unload her bags
my mother was the only person who in my misfortune remained faithful to me indeed she has always spoken of me in my true light as a martyr to the
rascality of others and a victim of my own generous and confiding temper
mother supervising kitchen staff
she was an invaluable person to me in my house which would have been at rack and ruin before but for her spirit of order and management and her excellent
economy in the government of my rapidly dwindling household staff
roderick and his mother
if anything could have saved me from the consequences of villainy in others it would have been the admirable prudence of that worthy creature
action as per voice over
she never went to bed until all the house was quiet and all the candles out you may fancy that this was a matter of some difficulty with a man
of my habits who had commonly a dozen of jovial fellows to drink with me every night and who seldom for my part went to bed sober
actions as per voice over
many and many a night when i was unconscious of her attention has that good soul pulled my boots off and seen me laid by my servants snug in bed
and carried off the candle herself
action as per voice over
and been the first in the morning too to bring me my drink of small beer
it was my mothers pride that i could drink more than any man in the country
roderick and his mother holding a letter before a fire which slowly brings out the writing in lemon juice between the widely spaced lines of directions to her milliner
my mother discovered that always before my lady wife chose to write letters to her milliner she had need of lemons to make her drink as she said and this
fact being mentioned to me kind of set me a thinking
reading letter aloud this day three years ago my last hope and pleasure in life was taken from me and my dear child was called to heaven
where is his neglected brother whom i suffered to grow up unheeded by my side and whom the tyranny of the monster to whom i am united drove to exile
and perhaps to death
i pray the child is still alive and safe
come to the aide of a wretched mother who acknowledges her crime her coldness towards you and now bitterly pays for her error
what sufferings what humiliations have i had to endure
i am a prisoner in my own halls
i should fear poison but then i know the wretch has a sordid interest in keeping me alive and that my death would be the signal for his ruin
but i dare not stir without my odious hideous vulgar gaoler the horrid irish woman who purses my every step
i am locked into my chamber at night like a felon and only suffered to leave it when ordered into the presence of my lord to be present at his
orgies with his boon companions and to hear his odious converse as he lapses into the disgusting madness of intoxication
roderick and the countess and mother at a silent dinner
it was not possible to recover the name for whom the note was intended but it was clear that to add to all my perplexities three years after my poor
childs death my wife whose vagaries of temper and wayward follies i had borne with for twelve years wanted to leave me
i decided it best not to reveal to her ladyship our discovery that we might still intercept and uncover further schemes with might be afoot
a few cuts showing mother keeping an eye on the countess
yet i was bound to be on my guard that she should not give me the slip
had she left me i was ruined the next day
i set my mother to keep sharp watch over the moods of her ladyship and you may be sure that her assistance and surveillance were invaluable to me
if i had paid twenty spies to watch her lady i should not have been half so well served as by the disinterested care and watchfulness of my excellent mother
roderick walking with the countess
my lady cosgroves relationship with me was a singular one
her life was passed in a series of crack brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me
we would quarrel for a fortnight then we should be friends for a month together sometimes
one day i was joking her and asking her whether she would take the water again whether she had found another lover and so forth
she suddenly burst out into tears and after a while said to me roderick you know well enough that i have never loved but you
was i ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy
ever so angry but the least offer of good will on your part did not bring me to your side
did i not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of england upon you
have i repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it
no i loved you too much and too fondly i have always loved you
from the first moment i saw you i saw your bad qualities and trembled at your violence but i could not help loving you
i married you though i knew i was sealing my own fate in doing so and in spite of reason and duty
what sacrifice do you want from me
i am ready to make any so you will but love me or if not that at least you will gently us me
roderick kisses her
i was in a particularly good humor that day and we had a sort of reconciliation
roderick and his mother
depend on it artful hussy has some other scheme in her head now
the old lady was right and i swallowed the bait which her ladyship had prepared to entrap me as simply as any gudgeon takes a hook
arrival of mr
newcombe the money broker
i had hired a money broker especially to find some means of my making a loan
after several months without success it was with some considerable interest that i received his visit
roderick and the money broker mr
i have good news for you mr
the firm of bracegirdle and chatwick in the city of london are prepared to lend you pounds pledged against your interest in the edric mines
they will redeem the encumbrances against the property which amount to some pounds and take a twenty year working lease on the mines
they will lend you the pounds against the lease income which they will apply to the loan as it comes in and they will make a charge of per annum
interest on the outstanding loan balance
newcombe i have made some difficult loans during the past few years at very onerous terms but a year interest seems very stiff indeed
considering your financial circumstances mr
cosgrove it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you
i think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity
but obviously if you would reject this offer i shall keep trying to find a better one
after a pause i am prepared to accept the terms mr
there are a few other points we should discuss
the loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyships signature and provided that bracegirdle and chatwick can be assured of her ladyships freewill in giving her signature
provided that they can be assured of her ladyships freewill
are you serious
may i be quite frank with you
yes of course
mister bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life and meditated a separation in which case she might later repudiate any
documents signed by herself while in durance and subject them at any rate to a doubtful and expensive litigation
they were quite insistent on this point and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyships perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their
when i asked them in what form they would accept her ladyships assurances they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent
by word of mouth in their presence at their counting house in birchin lane london
i requested they come here and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to london but they declined saying that they did not wish to incur the
risk of a visit to castle hackton to negotiate as they were aware of how other respectable parties such as messrs
sharp and salomon had been treated here
roderick and his mother
depend on it there is some artifice
when once you get into that wicked town you are not safe
there are scores of writs out against you for debt
if you are taken in london and thrown into prison your case is hopeless
mother dear we are now living off our own beef and mutton
we have to watch lady cosgrove within and the bailiffs without
there are certain situations in which people cannot dictate their own terms and faith we are so pressed now for money that i would sign a bond with old nick
himself if he would provide a good round sum
with this money we can settle our principal debts and make a fresh start
roderick you must listen to me
as soon as they have you in london they will get the better of my poor innocent lad and the first thing that i shall hear of you will be
that you are in trouble
you will be a victim of your own generous and confiding nature
roderick and the countess
why go roderick
i am happy here as long as you are kind to me as you now are
we cant appear in london as we ought the little money you will get will be spent like all the rest has been
let us stay here and be content
she takes his hand and kisses it
mother and roderick
i believe she is at the bottom of it the wicked schemer
rodericks carriage moving along
we did not start in state you may be sure
we did not let the country know we were going or leave notice of adieu with our neighbors
the famous mr
james cosgrove and his noble wife traveled in a hack chaise and pair
the countess lays her head on rodericks shoulder and smiles
when a man is going to the devil how easy and pleasant a journey it is
the thought of the money quite put me in a good humor and my wife as she lay on my shoulder in the post chaise going to london said it
was the happiest ride she had taken since our marriage
the carriage stops and they disembark
one night we stayed at reading
roderick and his wife at dinner
my lady and i agreed that with the money we would go to france and wait there for better times and that night over our supper formed a score of
plans both for pleasure and retrenchment
you would have thought it was darby and joan together over their supper
roderick and his wife making love
when i recollect lady cosgroves smiles and blandishments how happy she seemed to be on that night
what an air of innocent confidence appeared in her behavior and what affectionate names she called me
i am lost in wonder at the depth of her hypocrisy
who can be surprised that an unsuspecting person like myself should have been a victim to such a consummate deceiver
the coach drives up
we were in london at three oclock an half an hour before the time appointed
roderick and the countess looking for the office
i easily found out mr
tapewells apartment a gloomy den it was and in an unlucky hour i entered it
they climb up dirty backstairs lit by a feeble lamp and the dim sky of a dismal london afternoon
the countess seems agitated and faint
when they get to the door she stops in front of it
roderick dont go in
i am sure there is danger
theres time yet let us go back anywhere
the countess has put herself before the door in a theatrical attitude and takes rodericks hand
he pushes her away to one side
lady cosgrove you are an old fool
she jumps at the bell which is quickly answered by a moldy looking gentleman in an unpowered wig
say lady cosgrove is here
she stalks down the passage muttering old fool
tapewell is in his musty room surrounded by his parchments and tin boxes
he advances and bows begs her ladyship to be seated and points towards a chair for roderick which he takes rather wondering at the lawyers insolence
the lawyer retreats to a side door saying he will be back in a moment
in the next moment he reenters bringing with him another layer six constables in red waist coats with bludgeons and pistols and lord brookside
lady cosgrove flings herself into the arms of her son crying and whimpering and calling him her savior her preserver her gallant knight
then turning to roderick she pours out a flood of invective which quite astonishes him
oh fool as i am i have outwitted the most crafty and treacherous monster under the sun
yes i was a fool when i married you and gave up other and nobler hearts for your sake yes i was a fool when i forgot my name and
lineage to unite myself with a base born adventurer a fool to bear without repining the most monstrous tyranny that ever woman suffered to allow my property to be squandered to see women as base and low born as yourself
for heavens sake be calm
tapewell bounds back behind the constables seeing a threatening look in rodericks eye
the countess continues in a strain of incoherent fury screaming against roderick and against his mother and always beginning and ending the sentence with the word fool
you didnt tell all my lady i said old fool
i have no doubt that you said and did sir everything that a blackguard could say or do
this lady is now safe under the protection of her relations and the law and need fear your infamous persecutions no longer
but you are not safe and as sure as i am a man of honor i will have your hearts blood
take down his words constables swear the peace against him
i would not sully my sword with the blood of such a ruffian
if the scoundrel remains in london another day he will be seized as a common swindler
wheres the man who will seize me
he draws his sword placing his back to the door
let the scoundrel come
you you cowardly braggart come first if you have the soul of a man
the countess and the bailiffs move away
we are not going to seize you
my dear sir we dont wish to seize you we will give you a handsome sum to leave the country only leave her ladyship in peace
and the country will be rid of such a villain
as brookside says this he backs into the next room
the lawyer follows him leaving roderick alone in the company of the constables who are all armed to the teeth
i was no longer the man i was at twenty when i should have charged the ruffians sword in hand and sent at least one of them to his account
i was broken in spirit regularly caught in the toils utterly baffled and beaten by that woman
was she relenting at the door when she paused and begged me to turn back
had she not a lingering love for me still
her conduct showed it as i came to reflect on it
it was my only chance now left in the world so i put down my sword upon the lawyers desk
roderick puts his sword down on the lawyers desk
gentlemen i shall have no violence you may tell mr
tapewell i am quite ready to speak with him when he is at leisure
roderick sits down and folds his arms quite peaceably
i was instructed to take a lodging for the night in a coffee house near grays inn and anxiously expected a visit from mr
tapewell talking to roderick
i have been authorized by lady cosgrove and her advisors to pay you an annuity of pounds a year specifically on the condition of you remaining abroad out of the
three kingdoms and to be stopped on the instant of your return
i advise you to accept it without delay for you know as well as i do that your stay in london will infallibly plunge you in gaol as there are
innumerable writs taken out against you here and in the west of england and that your credit is so blown upon that you could not hope to raise a shilling
i will leave you the night to consider this proposal but if you refuse the family will proceed against you in london and have you arrested
if you accede a quarter salary will be paid to you at any foreign port you should prefer
tapewell i do not require a night to consider this proposal
what other choice has a poor lonely and broken hearted man
i shall take the annuity and leave the country
i am very glad to hear that you have come to this decision mr
i think you are very wise
there is a knock at the door and roderick opens it
brookside enters with four constables armed with pistols
the dialogue for this scene has to be written
brookside has gone against the bargain and has decided to have roderick arrested upon one of the many writs out against him for debt
tapewell is surprised and complains weakly that brookside is acting in bad faith
brookside brushes aside his objections
roderick is defeated and meekly sits down in a chair
the following lines are read over roderick being shackled and led out of the room
james cosgroves personal narrative finishes here for the hand of death interrupted the ingenious author soon after the period which this memoir was compiled after he had lived nineteen years
an inmate of the fleet prison where the prison records state he died of delirium tremens
his mother now very old and hobbled with arthritis enters the prison carrying a basket on her arm
his faithful old mother joined him in his lonely exile and had a bedroom in fleet market over the way
she would come and stay the whole day with him in prison working
signing a payment draft the countess sighs and gazes out of the large window
the countess was never out of love with her husband and as long as she lived james enjoyed his income of pounds per year and was perhaps as happy in
prison as at any period of his existence
brookside tearing up the payment draft presented to him by his accountant
when her ladyship died her son sternly cut off the annuity devoting the sum to charities which he said would make a nobler use of it than the scoundrel who
had enjoyed it hitherto
roderick now grey haired blacking boots
when the famous character lost his income his spirit entirely failed
he was removed into the paupers ward where he was known to black boots for wealthier prisoners and where he was detected in stealing a tobacco box
roderick and his mother
action as per voice over
his mother attained a prodigious old age and the inhabitants of the place in her time can record with accuracy the daily disputes which used to take place between mother
and son until the latter from habits of intoxication falling into a state of almost imbecility was tended by his tough old parent as a baby almost and would cry if deprived of his necessary glass of brandy
it was in the reign of george iii that the above named personages lived and quarreled good or bad handsome or ugly rich or poor they are all equal now
