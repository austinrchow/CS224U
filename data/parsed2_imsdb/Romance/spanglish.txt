brooks a shape fills the lower portion of the screen
it is a mans back
a perfect back
good dark color slim muscular
latin music plays
if you understood the words you would hear love confronted and considered in a very specific way
we are in a mexico city suburb
the day is hot small beads of sweat are seen on the mans back the first indication that we are in slow motion
perfect red fingernails come into view
and now a womans hand goes beautifully to work
part sensual back scratch part massage
the hand cups bits of the mans back a strong thumb probes his spine a long finger teases the very top of his ass in a cute finger pirouette and
then continues down and as the hand rises once more to the top of his back for another trip down his upper body
main titles begin full titles minute after minute of titles with some key dissolves helping us to represent some minutes of time passage as the hand continues to scratch and
rub the man making sounds of pleasure
the hand is getting tired
flirtatious no more this is getting to be work
the unseen woman shakes the hand vigorously the man says a single sound urging her to continue the exhausted hand complies then stops then the unseen woman changes hands as
the new hand wearing a wedding ring goes to work then it too stops to rest
the man says something in spanish
important for us because it will establish that there will be no subtitles and yet we understand perfectly that he is asking her to continue
she replies in spanish lightheartedly with a small and pretty laugh that her hands are tired
the man tells her to continue
she continues the rub now desultory and resentful
she stops for another rest
the man wants more and grabs forcibly at her hand his own hand coming into view for the first time
she says in spanish with no particular anger you said you would never push me around again
if you do i will somehow break your arm so you can rub your own back as high as you want
note all spanish dialogue will be worked hard to provide something extra for the spanish speaking
working in tidbits or extra exposition jokes etc
for now the mans tone changes placating her to continue
even as she resumes the massage they begin to have a domestic argument in spanish
this is no longer a massage we envy
this back rub going as it does from sex and hope to discord and alienation will be our only full direct knowledge of their marriage
showing us the room and beyond through the window a school bus stopping at the corner on a dusty road
we now see the full figure of the womans back as she looks up with excitement and stops rubbing with the word
when the man protests her stopping she indicates they should both run and meet their daughter
he waves her off
stunned by his disinterest she runs from the room
as cristina six years old and adorable waits patiently to step down
she sees her mother and grins and waves excitedly digging into her little pack to pull out an english book which she displays with pride
now she steps down from the bus and as she walks toward camera narration begins
the voice is of a girl eleven years older than the child we see
to princeton universitys director of admissions in considering me for a scholarship you have asked for and have every reason to expect an essay from me about myself
and as a clever high school graduate i of course realize the subtext of this essay about who i am and why i want to enter princeton is actually to
make clear to you why you should have me
i have gotten tips from friends who have preceded me to college that being a latina with my grades list of activities and relative poverty i am as good as
in if i simply do the dance and work in a word like bipolarization every so often
and while i love dances this dance of self is one i am afraid to master
young girl looks off and lights up i prefer to write about my mother
a drop dead gorgeous latin woman in her early s
as mother and daughter move inside a car pulls up with an ominous man getting out
he nods in another direction calling our attention to a police car parked off the street
the woman does not notice instead shepherding the child to her father
the woman makes a big fuss over the text books the child has
this is one supportive mom
again she is disbelieving that her husband shows no interest especially when the child seems briefly hurt
the womans husband looks from the window and sees the ominous man coming
the woman now does everything humanly possible to distract the child so she does not see what is transpiring
for my mother that afternoon eleven years ago was a watershed not because of my fathers
narrator contd imprisonment but because it was my first day at school
this room is directly across from the husbands room
the woman looks up to see her husband open the suitcase to show the man a huge store of mont blanc pens and high end watches
the man gives her husband some money
all the time the woman is chattering to distract the girl
looking off the woman grows wide eyed as she sees her husband count some money
the undercover cop begins shouting orders
the woman raises her voice to cover the argument in the next room which puzzles her daughter
there was never any pretense that the gorgeous vital clever temperamental animal that was my mother ever for a heartbeat considered having any life of her own
she ignored all her needs and was alive only for me
it was terrific
a long beat at the time
as she watches her daughter chew a cookie
her daughter begins to tell about her day her young mother taking on a glow we have not yet seen
and all the while she eyes the action in the next room
her husband makes a break for the window
the other man points a gun at the ceiling preparing to fire a warning shot
the woman moves ever so quickly to a shelf of her favorite dishes all the while talking to her daughter making much over the kids new school books
it is an impressive charade
and just as the cop shoots at the ceiling in perfect timing she upsets the dishes the resulting noise covering the shot
the woman asks her daughter what she learned today
the daughter says she was taught a little english
mother is impressed as she watches the cop move her husband toward the front door where other police await
her daughter starts to follow her gaze and she distracts her
brandishing the spanish english book and asking her to say something
standing proudly smoothing her skirt
as she clears her throat and says directly into camera
the girl and woman are enormously excited over this word even though outside her lifes mate is being loaded into the back of a police car
note mexican police do not duck the perpetrators head when loading them in the back seat
they just allow the concussion
it seems the mother will save her child the trauma of her father being carted off but the police turn on their siren and the girl turns to see her
father as the car pulls away
the child is stricken
a tear starts to form in her eye
her mother acts quickly
we are about to see powerful emotion reversed by sheer force of will
the mother leans down gives three quick kisses power pecks to the girls cheeks and then an admonition in spanish
sola una sola
haz la mejor possible
so make it a good one
this was my mothers instruction to me
baffled by the edict
holding up one finger
she means it
as she complies
one great tear forming and falling
her mothers thumb wipes it away
but now her eyes well with more tears
her mother gestures she must have strength and resolve
and so she does
a toss of her pretty little head
the eyes clear
as the mother lying in bed with her daughter loses her own fight with tears
managing with difficulty to keep her convulsive sobs silent since her daughter and she are intertwined like pretzels
the girl works on her lesson plan
she is a study in beauty
her mothers daughter
across the small hallway her mother greets and deals with friends and family in a
as the girl works
her dress changing as the days change while different visitors listen hard to her mother across the hall
my mother dealt with our considerable problems of survival by talking
always she discovered her own best thoughts by sifting through her own words
the mother stops talking in mid sentence realizing she has just solved something and makes a note
each night my mother promised me a wonderful life
each night i looked for a new expressive way to tell my mother how much i loved her
the child is ardent
clutching at her heart
kissing her mother
holding her mothers face talking directly into her eyes
the mother enormously pleased is nonetheless thrown by the extremes of it
i just played and did my lessons and every time i looked up my mother was in the process of saving us
her mother selling keepsakes
friends and relatives bringing food clothing toys
desperation in her hands was our weapon
we see her totally intimidating a priest
with this weapon she had her marriage annulled usually impossible for the poor and somehow convinced an associate of my fathers to transport two mexicans north in style
the mother and daughter seating themselves
the mother is enormously nervous with the prospect of flight
she sits the daughter ignores an empty seat and goes on her lap mother hugging daughter daughter hugging the hug
to girl how you doing
accented english hi
how are you
i am fine
she checks her book of english synonyms happy merry joyful glad contented frisky
as they taxi
to mother are you her mother sister
the mother says solo espanol only spanish
the daughter starts to chatter excitedly about the imminent flight
her mother quiets her firmly in order to pray for their safety
as the plane continues to taxi
we hear the mothers prayer in spanish
she then nudges her daughter
who with this gentlest of prods repeats the same prayer
the plane crossing the rio grande
my mothers prayer for us which she made me repeat exactly represented a stunning look into our future
please god let only the bad things change
use this image if ever you want to strike a coin depicting the moment of no return
the child aglow with happy anticipation
the adult brave and enormously anxious
the pilot taken with the mothers looks
how can i reach you
he glances over
this is not lechery it is art appreciation
an errant but decent man awed by the creature he is drawn to
my mother had redefined her own passions
blaming herself for the father she gave me she would never again be lured by a mans rough edges
she had decided that goodness would be her catnip
as she feels him looking at her and turns
with some affection and regret she shakes her head no
as he mouths the word ouch
plane landing on a dirt and grass strip
standing on the tarmac
latin flavored music suddenly gives way to a texas country harmonica riff
the child tries to comfort her apprehensive mother with the one wondrous fact she finds so thrilling
the mother hurries her along in the direction of distant lights
more emphatically texas
the two of them waiting small figures
she raises her fingers like pistols
shoots blows in them and reholsters them
bus traveling the highway
the child looks out sadly
as they disembark
the mother studying a slip of paper
fearing she has made the mistake of a lifetime
the child fascinated by all
at the time i was oblivious to my mothers anguish
she loved and lived to talk
now as if by a witchs spell words were no longer her bridge but her barrier
in a very real sense she feared she had left herself behind
the mother sees something
a street full of stores with signs in spanish
she begins walking the street asking passers by for directions in spanish and is answered
her step lightens
she beams with relief
so far so very very good
an iron gate in front
small courtyard ringed by a second floor horseshoe of apartments
we moved into a place managed by my mothers aunt
my mother worked two jobs in two local stores paying a total of dollars a week
as the mother enters
just ever so barely enough
cristina taking a newspaper from her book bag and seriously pondering then circling grocery coupons
cristina taking a snack from the refrigerator
smiling at the note her mother left
lighting a burner and melting cheese on a tortilla
but we were fine
we had it down
if only i could have stayed six
the camera moves quickly from the child to the courtyard is lit with colored lights and candles
a wedding reception is in progress gorgeous round and full cheeks stretched into a deep explosive smile
back to scene
music plays and we focus on cristina now nearing years of age
dancing with her mother and some other smaller children
the mother eyes the muscular back of a great looking man
who turns and quickly oozes quality sex appeal
she is turned on
they talk in spanish
him saying something hushed like i have been afraid to talk to you
i need oxygen when i look at you
she indicates the six children she is dancing with and offers to include him in some ring around the rosey dance
he indicates the magic of just the two of them
she quickly leads her little flock away
a reed thin fourteen year old boy is staring at them
at first the mother thinks this is adorable
the child eyeing her as if he were a man
she indicates he should join the rest of the children for a dance
as he steps forward and it becomes clear it is cristina he is interested in
before the mom can do anything about it he asks cristina to dance and she readily accepts
satellite virginities falling with alarming speed
the first time held by a male the first time held close the first sexy albeit touchingly awkward gaze from half closed male eyes which utterly confuses cristina
he begins to grind his hips into his dancing partner
it is exactly as if she sees her daughter about to be run down by a car
only this time the thing to do is scare the car
she runs toward the boy he sees the force of nature coming his way and makes a break but she gets him and actually lifts him and throws him to
then pats him on the head maternally and goes back to cristina
somewhat proud of her mom as the boy leaves the scene
that quickly it was clear she could no longer work two jobs and leave me to my own at night
the following morning she did something about it
a boy i never saw again had changed our lives
the mother and her aunt monica take their seats
the bus is filled with domestics
the mother nervous looks over to see and greet
the bride from last nights wedding
to mom este es stone canyon
as they disembark and start walking joining the busload of domestics into the canyon and up the hill
they walk past a perfect country club fairway
grand trees from either side meet each other high over the road
she sees the stuff
the dream that makes you migrate
she is not awed
she is jazzed
to her aunt she does the latin version of oh
at regular intervals in the background one black suv after another has a mother taking kids home from school
monica presses the security intercom
the gate swings open
in the foreground an expanse of turned up dirt
and huge rolls of sod ready to be laid down
a catering truck stands in the driveway
lots of glass french doors stand open to lawn pool and pool house
they look off
deborah norwich clasky a cool beauty in her mid s sits dominating this three generation portrait of the good life
she is wearing a straw hat and killer hawaiian shirt
she is a perfect dresser meaning her clothes seem to say she doesnt care while every article is a true and gifted find
she is drinking from a tumbler which is also of the dont hold your breath while you try to find something as terrific variety
she is flanked by her mother evelyn who is drinking from a stemmed glass with two olives and her year old overweight daughter bernice
who is reading her grandmother idly holding her hand
in the immediate area more rolls of sod wait to be laid
as they stand inside the kitchen not sure what to do next
then deborah gestures that they should join her at the pool
as they start out
three stooges retro
those french doors were not open after all
monica hits first
the women at the pool react
deborah and bernice running
evelyn momentarily attempts to join the rush
she half rises and then thinks better of it
too late in the day for sudden movements
gee whiz in heaven
how are you
a bit hyper dont worry
im not mad
i was looking for decoration to put on the glass so people would stop walking into it and instead of taking what they had in stock which was awful i
ill design something myself which i should have done in the fi
our heroine seeing the blood flow from her aunts nose gestures that monica needs help not conversation
and what difference does that make when your nose is bleeding
shut up deborah
now you got it mom
deborah grabs at paper towels gets an ice pack from the freezer and then grabs some cash from a bowl in the kitchen
she has moment to moment the enormous desire to feel loved that only the seriously hard to love can experience
here take these
second thought was that strange to give you money
i just felt badly that
she pockets the cash
as the group arrives at the outdoor table
evelyn makes half hearted incomplete gestures of shaking hands nodding indicating a seat
each simple act a test which she fails every gesture a bit too late and then some
simply too much for her to manage with the drinks under her belt
in the background workers roll out sod the yard becoming more beautiful even as we look
she is my niece
she and her daughter live in the apartment i manage
yolanda who worked for you lived there before she went back home
thats how i heard about the job
so who am i interviewing
forcefully youre gorgeous
on our gal
as she not understanding the word smiles and nods
translating sotto vistosos
our gal thrown
not knowing how now to react
she doesnt mean it as a compliment
its more of an accusation
this is my daughter bernice and this is my mother evelyn norwich
rising excuse me
glad youre okay
then to other latina good luck
our gal smiles back in appreciation
this involves you
i wouldnt want some kid around for my interview
you understand mom
to bernice strength of character
taste for futility god i love you
she eyes with disapproval her mothers empty glass
then to bernice stop
its just a conversation not an interview
to visitors dont you want to get out of the sun
she indicates a shaded seat
deborah is protected by hat umbrella sun glasses while her guest sits bareheaded enjoying the rays and indicates she is fine
underneath deborahs surface is a russian roulette of deeply felt emotions
at this moment she is earnest and vulnerable
you guys want some lemonade
they demur lets just talk
i have two children
my husband works nights
hes a chef and has his own place
do you work
i helped run a commercial design company until ten months ago when
it was downsized to zip
i have two children
i like the house to be like me in that im very loose and meticulous at the same time
its all about first names and closeness here but i care about the place you know
its what they used to call homemaker
the two visitors exchange a wide eyed look
which deborah sees and understands
to monica im not leaving time for you to translate
monica says in spanish this woman is very strange
the only thing i understand is she has two kids
deborah leans into monica
face to face tender but unblinking
too bad for you that it just never occurred to you to check on how much spanish i know
a solid beat of humiliation then im sorry what i say about you
dont hold it against her
i dont speak any spanish
but im not an idiot i talk for an hour and you say two words
what did you say
monica squirms unusual for her
you got your nose bopped
i got my feelings hurt
as monica paraphrases what has happened her translation is dialed down for the as deborah continues talking i will major in linguistics and make sociology my sub concentration
because it has been my experience that the barriers of
narrator contd language are more than we dare admit
that as much as we translate finally we will never understand each other
my mothers name for example beautiful in spanish becomes leaden and awful when pronounced by a non latin
whats your name
one of my five spanish words
she pronounces flor in the latin way
lots of rrrrs with a curling of the tongue sound at the end
she pronounces it flat like the floor we walk on
throughout the following each of the women sticks to their pronunciation as indicated by the extra rs
what i walk on
it means flower right
deborah is beginning to feel criticized
she takes a beat
eyes everyone with some hostility
directly to flor is there some school of the ear im flunking out of right now
flor says to monica in spanish a tip to pronounce her name
monica warns flor to leave it rest
since deborah is becoming clearly and strangely pissed
what did she say
she feels the tension but so far in her life her own irrepressible personality has served her so she moves forward with surprising and quiet confidence and assurance
she tells her aunt to repeat her words so that now for the first time she is through monica talking directly to deborah
translating she says
if you curl your tongue and let it be loose you will have it
that its hard for americans
she says its great that you try so hard
many people wouldnt bother
an emotional pronouncement her greatest accolade she gets me
she smiles at flor who returns the smile
you want some lemonade
take some lemonade
she pours some for flor and monica
then she closes her eyes and pauses in utter dedication to a final effort florrrrr
it is perfect
flor grins at deborahs victory
claps her hands together
a spanish word sublime
deborah feels relief
free for a moment from the dark corridors of self criticism
she is lighter prettier innocent
wholly and completely attractive
whew dense but stubborn right
an important declaration what you just did with me is just what kids need
patience and encouragement
bernice rises like a shot to take off
to flor look forward to seeing you
as she leaves
absently to bernie love you
then with not a monoseconds break the job is six days a week seven to seven
the kids and all housekeeping how much a week would you like
flor embarrassed a bit by the directness ducks the question
saying in spanish whatever you say
this is an important question
if you ask for too little it means you dont value
too much and youre taking advantage
after monica translates so
flor is dumbstruck by the challenge of this pop quiz but not without some native wit and style to maneuver around it
extremely heavy accent one thousand dollars
deborah falls for it until flor laughs
deborah now a big smile snort of a laugh putting her hand to her face and shaking her head
as monica uses deborahs reaction time to in mid laugh flash four fingers to flor
catching the gesture and secretly indicating to monica they should go for six
firmly six hundred dollars
flor shoots her a look of fear
a tense beat
welcome to the family
deborah kisses her
sort of on the mouth
in the midst of flors delight she is thrown by deborahs kiss
it is the first of many borders to be violated
as flor and monica exit and can finally show their full joy
john clasky driving a smallish suv
he is an upbeat talented successful man with an ego as balanced as a high end watch who loves his wife kids and job
in other words watch out john
as john pulls into the driveway next to a catering truck and exits his suv carrying a large wrapped tray
as john moves quickly through the downstairs he puts the tray on a counter where food servers are working
i brought some dessert
as he moves on we see in the background the workers unwrap and react to a fantastic concoction
a caterer who we may notice looks at him like royalty falls in beside him and whispers to him
she came down to check on the party and realized the gardeners hadnt finished rolling the sod
deborah is wearing a party dress
they are rolling out the last huge cylinder of sod completing the now beautifully manicured backyard
it is hard manual labor involving physical strength
the female caterers are complaining that its too heavy but deborah is undeterred
to catering women we can do it
she falls over the roll
but it gives and they gain momentum
one of the catering women falling down one losing pace
deborah however gains the upper hand
yet even while succeeding she remonstrates herself
great exertion why
and now she wins
the cylinder of grass rolls all the way out and she jumps on the seam in victory
she is dirty spent and triumphant
the components for a solid sexual experience
and in truth as the exhausted caterers half heartedly applaud the bizarre victory she has gotten off
she looks with mothers pride at the lawn
then sees john
can you believe they left without finishing
as she looks at her handiwork john looks at her
he loves the dame
looks great huh
youre not looking
i was getting a kick looking at you look at it
not the answer she wanted
i better get dressed again in case anybodys just a half hour late
she hits a switch at the door and the backyard area is now fully illuminated set up for a dinner party for or so
all details thought about and done to a t
this is the outdoor lighting nobody nails
the twinkling of a half acre
the path to the pool like a runway to heaven
as she looks at it all she has a wistful moment
a replenishing sigh okay
were okay here
then why cant everything be like sod
theres no wait no dung nothing you have to do right and yet its perfect
it covers up all your dirt and makes things immediately pretty
then the miracle if you just give it time it roots and you cant tell it from the real thing
a look to her husband no reaction
nothing to say
well no i dont have anything particular to say
oh john why dont you just take out a knife and kill me all together
somewhat crushed she prepares to exit
howd you get there
hey wait a minute
she turns id like to figure this one out
what would have been the great thing for me to say after you said the sod sentence
thats actually a good question
there you go
i surprise sometimes
i would have liked if after i compared the sod to life if you had said exactly
she turns to leave
but to say that and mean it id have to think the same way you do
some sense of mischief its worth a try
i had something else to tell you
itll come to me
standing in a nicely decorated middle class restaurant cristina totally bilingual speaks to the american hostess with a pronounced and charming accent as her mother standing beside her bounces with
energy and joy
could we have a table for two please
flor says something to her in spanish
the daughter waves it off and when the mother persists she translates
smoking or non smoking
before her daughter can translate
the hostess laughs
they are seated at the two ends of a banquette and each automatically picks up her place setting and scootches closely together
cristina picks up a menu and points to the prices
flor scoffs says shes making six hundred dollars a week
then looks at the prices and does a take
the hostess returns cristina points to the menu
this is just for the starter
flor encouraging her daughters spirit of adventure places her hand over the prices in the menu
and those men would like to buy you a drink
the daughter translates
the hostess points out the early s well dressed quite nice looking businessmen
flor addresses the men who are several tables away
cristina moves uncomfortably but responds to her mothers nudge to translate
to men this is very embarrassing but whats wrong with you
im with my daughter for gods sake
then hostess flor and finally cristina laugh
cristina relishes getting back to ordering from the menu
in a moment that is a bit noteworthy
and i would like to begin with the jumbo shrimp
enjoying the canyon
as she walks the mile plus from the bus stop to work
one of a straggly line of domestics
deborah jogs into view
see you up there
deborah runs past
she is clearly upset
she is also more than a stay in shape jogger
she is an athletic woman fueled by an ever flickering pilot light of anxiety
this makes her seriously quick
she is highly aware of passing everybody
she needs to pass everybody
her voice trails behind her as she announces to all as she approaches
left please left left
john enters his sons room
think seriously about getting up
you dont have to get up yet but are you thinking seriously about it
bernice is making french toast doing something novel with the filling and the last cooking process
some great idea which will have us making a mental note to try it at home
john opens georgies door again
georgie gets up
yeah good morning
you as mad at me as mom cause of what happened
aware his answer will have repercussions but integrity wins
no georgie im not
are you mad at me
as flor enters from outside
morning good to see you
she notices the french toast
bernice holds out one slice on a spatula indicating flor should just tear a piece off which she does
one taste and she marvels her mouth dropping open at this kids ability to make something mundane special
her mother enters on her way upstairs
she is thoughtful tense and sweaty her run having failed to exorcise her current demon
she greets flor and then shakes her head making a vain attempt to communicate her troubled mood to flor in some sort of sisterhood based on life being a fucker
bernice prepares a plate for her mom while in the b
a golden retriever named chum approaches flor from behind with a ball in its mouth
flor is checking out the kitchen
whats in each drawer etc
deborah is impressed by the self starter display and indicates same to bernice
i had an idea for a breakthrough in french toast so i made breakfast
i dont want to be teased about it
no tough love
just try it and if by any chance you have a positive reaction
mean ol me
i cant play right now
i have to do something about your brother
i had an idea for a recipe
when has that happened
i got up early to do this
at least taste it for gods sakes
oh its good
oh god its rich oh god its good
sudden alarm by the way you could do without this
the approval rug pulled out from under her bernice looks at her mother
but deborah is unaware of having hurt her daughter because her attention has been diverted so that deborah and the camera lose focus on bernice as the teenager distraught moves
from the room
never do fetch
chum is nudging flor with the ball and flor was about to accommodate him by taking it before deborahs warning shout stopped her in mid sentence
i mean it never
on flors stunned reaction to the outburst
im not mad
im thinking of you
this is me being nice
then using her hands to demonstrate
just no taking ball from dog
broadly trust me on that one
close up on chum going nuts with deborahs hand passing in front of his face ignoring how urgently he offers the ball
you and me
we are fine
just a tip
she gives her waist a little squeeze girlfriends
flor is totally confused could you make some coffee
deborah directs her to the most complicated cappuccino machine italian overpriced artists ever devised
deb in the shower
you have never seen so many shampoos conditioners and bath balms
never seen so huge a sponge
such fluffy towels
skylight over the shower allows a beam of gods warmth
there is a fireplace in the bathroom
the only significance of this being that these people have a fireplace in their bathroom
the woman who made it all happen is putting in a contact lens
she is upset
we see that she has one blue eye and one brown
this isnt an argument honey
yes it is
so stop being so maniacally calm
because i understand your side
i cant be wrong about that too
this is a fight
were having a fight
yo i feel anger
deborah turns from the sink revealing one brown eye and one blue
she blinks realizes one lens is not in and turns back to the sink
can i have a moment
john exits into the
as john awaits his wife
a beat and she enters with two blue eyes
even though she is attempting reason and self control her voice is filled with tension and goes from loud to borderline yelling
lets get someplace here
as flor works methodically orienting herself
she is able to hear their totally foreign words and though their volume registers on her a bit basically she remains blithe
loading a dishwasher memorizing where everything is
you mister are crazy making
i cant take this calm thing youve
its like this is your way of letting me know theres something deeply wrong with me because im not calm
calmly lets not go all over the place
shouted burst if youre going to talk to me please have the decency to raise your voice
a beat then sudden urgency and change of tone lets make a break for it
what are you talking about
he signals her with his eyes and head and then takes a large but tentative step away from the spot where he was standing
then additional faster steps
he gestures with enormous energy for her to follow him to his new spot in the room
she eyes him suspiciously
just for a second
she walks to him
he puts an arm around her shoulder
and gestures back to where they were standing
he talks in an almost hushed conspiratorial voice
we dont have to be those people
theyve been masquerading as us for a while here
ill distract them you make a break for it and ill meet you outside
youre ridiculing me because i care about this
i mean this
lets get away from those two in case theyre as miserable as they look
like a southern coach come on baby
he is looking at her with wit and conviction
trying to squirt lighter fluid at the flame of their love
deborah looks up at him
intimacy of a different sort
let me ask you a question
let me change the subject
forget for a moment that you wont support me with georgie
reasonably well i dont think
she makes a noise of frustration to stop him
john is rendered still and intimidated by her conduct but he is man enough for his jaw to set
to pause for a beat as he looks her straight in the eye
and walks back to the spot they occupied previously
heres the question
its been on my mind more and more
do you do that calm thing for the purpose of infuriating me
genuinely puzzled what
on her exasperated look why would anyone do something to someone they love for the purpose of messing them up
unconvinced distant okay
he hates that look of isolation on her face
he needs to make her feel better
deb since high school weve been able to read each other
take advantage of it
the answer to the question is absolutely not
now take a look and tell me if you believe me
she looks at him
with a finger motion he directs her gaze to his eyes
close on johns eyes
open smiling trusting
trying to get a laugh out of her
studying questioning probing doubting exhausted
i think you just want me to feel badly about myself
john enters not seeing flor goes to the sparkletts water container and fills a cup
he is shaken
to himself great god in heaven save me
boy meets girl
he turns with a start to see flor smiling at him
his first word is inadvertent
i didnt know deborah had found someone
you work here
youre going to help with the house and kids
you work here and you dont speak any english at all
the sound of feet on the stairs
deborah and georgie enter
all she has to do is dial and press two for spanish
even before she enters flor
to john enunciating the name this is flor
pronouncing it perfectly hi flor
deborah reacts grabs some coffee and pushes georgie along
to deborah look ill take georgie to school
im doing it
show flor the ropes
flor is trying to figure out whats expected of her then deborah gestures impatiently for her to fall into step and come with her
the biggest baddest blackest suv
there is some subtle custom work so the vehicle impacts us in ways we cannot quite fathom
deborah is wiping away a tear as she gets in and shares a woman to woman moment with flor
fuckin hombres huh
flor nods uncertainly
a small voice from the back seat
i just didnt want to sing last night
well you said you would
you said you wanted to
i asked you five times
then when i have the whole party paying attention you refused
as she puts the car in gear
georgie sings insanely well
but hes just two lines into an old blues standard it doesnt do any good now georgie
she presses a button on her dash and a glass partition comes up between front and back seat thereby cutting him off in mid song
flor is utterly baffled by the notion of putting a divider between parent and child
but deborah is calling for her to pay attention to the cars navigation screen
a spanish voice says route guidance system starting
ive programmed it for spanish
look it will take you anywhere and then back home
if you figured out how to make coffee on that thing its all downhill
the male spanish voice talks about imminent left turns
flor is thrown by the amount of oddness
all the while georgie is singing his little heart out in the back seat
flor amused by the boy suppresses a smile
maybe the first time in her life shes had to suppress joy
but deborah never misses anything
this is stop gap
you kiddo youre going to have to learn english
the theory that nobodys sexier than when they are seen doing what they do best applies here
in the background johns number two peter the sous chef being bossy and anal as he organizes his cooking and gwen who spends most nights trying not to show her
enormous affection for john
at the moment johns work is a strange mixture of art and cloddishness
the hands blur with expertise
but he keeps dropping items
each time a latin kitchen worker alex dives on the spillage
at one point they bump
sharply to alex not the best place to stand fella
to alex no
youre the new helper huh
i didnt mean to
its me being bugged
two people head for john almost simultaneously
peg an arty looking woman in her late s
wild scraggly gray hair enters lugging an ice chest and the maitre d
you are going to be so happy
the maitre d enters
i have something very important to tell you
john makes a no brainer of a decision pointing to the woman who promised happiness
she hefts her ice chest up on the counter
perfect cod this is john john perfect cod
best one ive seen all season and he was swimming twenty minutes ago
the fish is that special a sentence that kicks out for a writer the right brush stroke for an artist
you get it
to alex you want to learn something
you want to pack it away
the kid nods
he picks up the fish
put it in the cooler but not on its side
in the same position it swims
important added thought and check the ice pack
make sure it can drain away
if it cant the chlorine can hurt the flesh
do all that and nobody can put a fish in the fridge better than you
and thats a solid start
first day and you already did something perfect
smiling yes i understand
he whispers in johns ear
what buddy what
victor spotted a food critic
the new york times
ill bet they sent her out just for us
hands john a slip heres what she ordered
look if youre nervous take a walk
i dont need a walk
ill walk with you
i know a breathing thing
what do you think im worried about
how ill cook
thats not the problem
looks at slip then to alex the lady wants fish
get the fish
he starts to prepare for cooking
i worked in a kitchen once in new york that got four stars
it was like a line formed for the chance to become an asshole
peoples accents changed
the heart went out of the place
w barely understated passion i agree with everything youve said
i admire you for your feelings
i hope to adopt them as my own
as he works
lets be clear here
this is that sequence that either kicks out or doesnt
no food channel
no simple knife stuff
something casually brilliant
smart and gifted as he prepares the critics meal
he is talking quickly
almost to himself
i dont know what to root for
the thought of one star makes me nauseous
but with four theres no place to go but oh my god they took away a star
three and a half
thats what you want
three and a half you feel disappointed that you just missed out on four
you know what you want
three and a quarter
a eureka moment that would be perfect
getting off on it it would mean youre good
but youre not good enough to feel disappointed that you just missed out on excellent
but nothing truly bad happened you still got your three and a quarter stars
which encourages you to try and improve
and you still get enough respect so that you can get good people to work with you
business is good but not crazy
youre right there underneath the radar where you get to mind your own business
thats a solid life
he tastes a sliver of the food dish he is preparing
with professional honesty and some regret aw man
this is amazing
no three and a quarter here
evelyn having a glass of white wine and a sandwich is talking to bernice in the kitchen also including flor though she is only catching a word here or there
well im in the vitamin section and this little hip hop girl
whats her name
grammys adorable big voice
oh shes famous
the kids know her
oh little blue shoes
flor looks concerned over evelyns displeasure with herself a fact picked up by the older woman
it is actually a small
but resonant good natured affectionate moment between the lush and the latina
god bless the language barrier it keeps you from being bored with me
spoken to directly like this flor is confused
anyway she said arent you evelyn wright
first of all that she recognized me from the old covers and then she
oh please her name
it makes the story so much better
she said genuinely stirred whenever i think everything is
aside pardon my french
pardon her french back to quote a mother hmmmhmmm
i put on one of your records
evelyn looks transparently vulnerable for a second
bernie squeezes her grandmothers hand
just such a lovely thing to come from the blue
deborah enters carrying a load of packages
with lightning speed her eye picks out
the glass her mother is drinking from
its not even noon
defensively its almost two oclock
god where is this day going
flor could you come with me
grandma tell mom what happened
very deliberately no
deborah leads the way out
but flor stops before following her out to give evelyn a gesture of support and appreciation
john is in bernies room helping her with her homework
they lay at right angles to each other
he is testing her
this is going to work
i dont know anything
free your mind
the president whose policies many consider responsible for the great depression
i dont know
name a vacuum cleaner
and this vacuum whooshed all this money out of everyones pockets
i no longer know nothing
and hoover was followed in office by
im just drawing blanks
its my own fault i spent my time on math which im lucky if i dont flunk anyway and
the guy we are looking for is not a ruse
whats ruse mean
so this president was not a ruse
he was the real thing
she looks at him blankly ruse
enjoying her fathers absurdity rusevelt
if id ever heard of the word before that would lock it in
its so stupid it might work anyway
deborah enters followed by flor
they are carrying several boxes of clothes
surprise new clothes
as she looks at a sweater
whatd i do right
bernice tries on the sweater over her t shirt
and mirth ends
the sweater is tight
bernice picks up a blouse and then skirt and checks the size
as they are coupled by the camera angle as each catches on and is dumbfounded
whose style wit and grace should not have to be used to deflect such trauma
but so be it as though mightily stung thanks mom
im glad you didnt get here a little earlier or else i wouldnt be able to tell you that your gift is a ruse
please excuse me
she exits to her bathroom
flor one step behind john and deborah who are moving quickly down the stairs
deborah feeling the futility of anyone understanding her point even as she makes it
shes right between the two sizes
i thought about it
what am i supposed to do encourage her
what is it
or motivate her to get herself in shape
flor tries to slide by
something surreptitious in her behavior
deborah suddenly turns to flor
she holds out her hand in a we women understand gesture
flor does not waver
just meets her eyes
me puedo ir
a bit nonplussed sure
ill drive you to the bus stop
and that fast they are gone
as john gets in his seat
then sees flor approaching the door and hops out to open her door
apologizing as he goes
as he moves back to his side of the vehicle
a shout shiiiiiiit
flor hears this from inside and nods in agreement
as they drive down the canyon
he is wildly frustrated
even if flor were not there he would be talking to himself anyway in the manner of bag ladies and all of us
i am running out of excuses for the lady of the house
flor doesnt understand his words
yet fully agrees
but then john takes rein of his emotions
but you know you gotta watch out for the times you think youre absolutely right
but man bernice has finals tomorrow
she didnt need this one
and just that look on her face when she got the gifts now his voice cracks he grows wet eyed like for a second she thought all her problems with
her mother had been solved
flor is flabbergasted
she peeks to see if he is actually crying
at first her heart is touched by john but then there is distinct disapproval a real roll of the eyes that the macho meter can read that low
he looks at her and she faces front quickly
my mother did not understand her male boss
his heart was good and he was rare in not flirting with her
but they were starkly different
privacy and dignity were the same word to my mother
naturally when she found herself sitting next to a man who cried over his childs hurt she had no idea how to process the event
meanwhile he has stopped for traffic near the end of the canyon
flor takes the opportunity to bolt
she opens the door and starts to get out though the car is still rolling a bit
what are you doing
let me take you all the way
reluctantly she re enters the car
it rolls another ten feet to her bus stop and she gets out again
how weird was this ride
no es nada
he doesnt quite know what that means
indicates same in a little helpless gesture
as flor is dropped off
the goodbye awkward
the job was taxing her
she had no template for confusion let alone frustration
while waiting for the bus flor suddenly turns and runs a few yards
and then back
and waves off the looks from her colleagues many of whom are overweight
many of them adorable
all puzzled for the moment as they watch flor unsuccessfully try to shake off her day
as flor enters kisses her daughter
distraught and distracted
she walks immediately to the refrigerator and takes out a chocolate cake and a bottle of milk
she cuts a huge slice of cake and puts it in front of her startled daughter
in spanish riding her on being too thin
the daughter gestures at her mothers own slim figure
it was so unusual for my mother to ask my help that i realized immediately she was losing her battle to be uninvolved with the claskys
flor asks her daughter how to say something in english
try it on
flor asks again in spanish
trying to find a precise phrase
the nuance important to her
please try it on
flor knows the word please
its not what she wants
what she wants is a way to say try it on in a manner which is not a request
or order but is rather friendly and caring
her daughter works on the problem
just try it on
thickly accented just try it on
small accent just try it on
improvement each time just try it on
just try it on
shes got it
our culture embraces fullness in a woman
you the women of the admissions committee as intelligent as you are have no idea how casual and complete such acceptance is back home in the land of the size
flor is the only one waiting
an empty bus stops and she gets on
as we see deborah cross sunset blvd
overtake and pass two ucla men running at a good clip as flors bus stops
as she strides purposefully up the street
this is one of the cultural differences between us which i wish to explore academically at princeton
american women i believe actually feel the same as hispanic women about weight
the house asleep
flor walks carefully up the steps
a desire for the comfort of fullness
bernie asleep on the bed
the solid sleep earned by a few hours of sobbing
she looks touchingly pretty and decidedly round
flor looks for finds and carries out the new clothes deborah had given her daughter
and when that desire is suppressed for style and deprivation allowed to rule
two young athletic men and one woman considerably ahead of her on the steep incline
they turn and look confused at deborah who is so far behind them she has no need to pass
they turn away
deborah struggles to turn it on and does so
huffing to just behind them where she utters one more strained left
and then passes
dieting exercising american women become afraid of everything associated with being curvaceous such as wantonness lustfulness sex food motherhood
all that is good in life
flor at work on a sewing machine
opening seams moving buttons even steaming where the buttons have been changed
flor is in the room
having put the altered clothes back in place
bernies alarm clock rings
she wakes and sees flor
buenas dias flor
flor holds up the new clothes and indicates that they are beautiful
well taste she has
bernie starts her morning routine
her back to us when damn good english just try it on
bernie though her back is to us does a take then turns grinning
when did you learn to
cutting her off just try it on
it doesnt fit
flor clearly doesnt understand
just try it on
flor extends a blouse and skirt
ill show you
she steps behind a closet door to try the clothes on muttering pessimistically before she does so
camera stays on lovely way to start the day
worlds most trim mexican learns her first sentence and uses it to watch me grrrrunt my way into
bernie open mouthed steps out wearing the clothes which fit like a glove
then laughs at bernies reaction as she keeps checking the waist and looks into the mirror
to see bernie in the foreground as flor looks on
nods approval and leaves
the fit of the clothes is as mystifying as it is nice
she picks up another shirt
checks the size tag and then studies it a bit
as bernies fingers find the barely visible holes where the buttons have previously been
flor at work
chum ball in mouth comes to her and nudges her
to dog lo siento
chum momentarily depressed walks away
she is a bit overwhelmed her voice breaking a bit even with one word
bernie moves to embrace her
as john comes down the stairs
he looks apprehensive
from the den comes the sound of singing
it stops him from going out the front door as he turns to check it out
john finds evelyn and georgie in their night clothes
they are singing an old song
something like lush life something preposterous for a nine year old boy
but you cant knock the quality of the voices
they see him and stop
every time he has a nightmare i teach him one of my old songs
that way the nightmares have a purpose
but i dont have to sing it for anyone
youre clear on that
how many did you sell of this song
embarrassed in front of john he likes to know that stuff
to georgie she was huge
seventy six thousand
which is great for a jazz album
they resume harmonizing
as john leaves the song lyric making some comment on as john growing tense walks toward the front gate
chum proffers a ball and accepts defeat as he bends down to pick up the new york times
johns body chemistry launches a surprise attack
anxiety and dread
he takes his newspaper to a wire bench in the front driveway
he finds the section
opens to the page
and just like that his life changes forevermore
georgie is going up the stairs
flor putting out breakfast food
strangely i am okay
to flor deborah around
john nods and heads upstairs
he looks in bernies room
she is loading her backpack for school
georgie enters the scene
a kid offered me a trade
let me show you
he starts to follow him to his room
he can wait
let him wait
yours is obviously important
you dont even know how important the trade is
let me just do georgie
he hands her the newspaper
we move with john and georgie to georgies room where he goes to his collectibles
he holds up a card
he says hell give me any three silvers for him
i dont know
this is the one you started with
you really want to give up your first card
note this is an involved discussion on both their parts
nothing in john thinks it is trivial
thats why i needed you
this is your favorite
i think hed go higher
but its not numbers
they are interrupted by a never quite heard before sound of exultation
flor and evelyn jolted
they exit to follow the sound
as they enter holding the paper
she has been smacked in the heart by gleeful and prideful emotions
it is disorienting for her to experience the rush of pleasure
for gods sake
why did you
crazy father why
why arent you screaming
im getting there
just the stunned thing has to get dealt with
reading from newspaper john clasky who at made his mark on the new york restaurant scene when jammed lived up to and survived its silly name has re emerged as
a young and confident veteran taking chances with his combinations in so subtle a manner
if he gave me six
catching her excitement wait a minute your sisters talking
evelyn indicates to flor that the good news is about john
and so she studies him a bit
beginning with the succession of appetizers each one with its own stunning and fully realized agenda is constantly yet casually daring
emotional and earnest aside ah dad
this is so great
to others now heres the thing
she tears up
evelyn rubs bernies back
looks at flor and taps her heart
flor indicates she should leave and does
bernice continues reading with a lovely sense of mission and moment
john is taken with his daughters delivery
eating at this perfect smaller passionate restaurant inspires ones own abandonment of caution
to wit john clasky is the best chef in the united states
genuinely enthusiastic look how great you read it
massive irony perfect dad
evelyn and bernice hug him
oh my god you even look different to me
what are you talking about
i wonder what mom will do
deborah is ripping johns clothes off
shreds of cloth
john is laughing happy
what is this
i dont know
she rips at her own clothes and then exclaims in passion
flor walks to the news stand as if to buy something changes her mind and leaves the frame only to return a half beat later where she reads to the
dealer from a note
heavily accented new york times
cristina standing translating the review into spanish for her mother
as she comes to the last sentence
john clasky es el mejor chef en los estados unidos
easily ah bravo
the claskys are engaged in sex
johns brief sounds are exuberant
they shift position so that deborah is on top bringing deborah into a close single
suddenly her smile fades she hits the skids
oh damn it what am i going to do
everything seems so surely pointless
this is weird
and then the small distinctive sound of debs climax
then in a relatively small voice
good good good
she falls off him
an arm across her eyes lying on her back down the bed from him
puzzling over what just happened
a few false starts forming his thought
from the vortex of depression yeah
he scoots to her side
you know i guess i got used to you getting a little blue after intercourse
something else i do wrong
she grabs something and starts walking toward the bedroom
youve gotta stop walking away
turning if i stay i will say awful things to you that i might not even mean
she exits to the bathroom
very upset as he drives
then comes to the red light at the end of the street and sees flor walking with others
an awkward beat as he waits for the light to change and they acknowledge each other
the light remains red
she confers with another woman
to woman yo lei la critica buena
the woman tells flor how to say it in english
parroting woman i read your good review
still the light doesnt change
the light changes
not so far
how you doing
the light has changed cars are beeping
she is about to let him go off but realizes he will wait for her answer
i do fine
he nods and drives off
as he enters
the phone is going off the hook
as he passes the maitre ds desk
their conversation is strangely hushed and very very quick
should i stop answering
were booked for two months solid
no no no no no
i want to keep some walk in business
i want this to stay neighborhood
there would be riots
you should hear the desperation in their voices
best day of my life
well serve a full menu at the bar then
then where do i put the people waiting for a table
it wont work
do this for me
theres no way
do this for me or ill set my hair on fire and start punching myself in the face
that was an unusual way for me to make myself understood
but youll do the bar thing
yes of course john
i need to talk to you
they walk into the cooling room
again there is a kind of strange rapidity to the conversation sparked by john
ive gotten a fantastic offer for my own place
everybody wants to back me since the paper came out
whats your reaction
because ive had this very unusual reaction
ive had a hard on almost all day and it wont go away
like im riding on the back seat of a bus with bad shocks and every other passenger is a gorgeous woman with a yellow sports top whose leaning over
its like every dream i ever had and some even i didnt have the balls to dream
so youre considering taking it
he looks at him okay heres the thing
i cant lose you and still keep the hours im keeping
i cant do my life unless i can hold onto you
sudden thought i think i just gave you an incredible bargaining position
as john and deborah lay next to each other
so you gave away twenty percent of the restaurant without talking to me about it
if i didnt do it id have been coming home just to sleep
trying to make livid more attractive remember the other day when you asked me the perfect response to something i said
im asking you now
what would you like my response to be to your giving away twenty percent of the business without asking me
with great enthusiasm youre ma man
so that would be
my dream response from you yes
measured im not quite there
actually i just had this flash that the reason women in the old days used to faint was to avoid doing acts of violence against men
a beat then and i was all worried about figuring out the timing just to talk to you about renting a place for the summer
well i think you got your timing
a man is parked at the gate in an open convertible
he is great looking
we hear deborahs excited voice over the gate speaker
be right out
as deborah calls behind her as she opens the door
mom you want to come
the realtors here
okay see you later
she clicks the gate open and walks to the man
perfect year old great looking surfer sort
deborah does the very slightest of takes at his looks
as she gets in
theres one great rental that just came on
so were starting at the top
as they pull away
deborahs hair whips across her face
ill never be one of those girls whose hair blows perfectly in a convertible
move your seat forward
puzzled she uses the electric lever and the seat budges forward
a little more
the realtor uses his switches and raises his window a bit
her window a bit less and monkeys the position of the half windows in back
deborah turns around checking out the odd tweaking and then faces forward
her hair blows perfectly and beautifully behind her
oh you must be trouble
on his small laugh
as they move toward the house
seeing the beach beyond
pretty fabulous beautiful
what word is the same in spanish
taking it as a compliment thanks
as deborah flor and evelyn enter
they carry boxes of stuff
i dont care if its a rental
this place is getting a fixing
she leads flor to a small bedroom
to flor with gestures this will be yours
flor doesnt understand
certainly doesnt want to
did you ask her if she could live in
theres no buses from her to here
theres no question
double come on
deborah uses her hand as if weighing something momentous like the law vs
the bible then with heavy sarcasm
the barrio carbon beach
the barrio carbon beach
what to do
to flor dont worry
im putting nicer stuff in here too
when flor gives no indication of anything just standing somewhat stupefied
deborah takes her by the hand and leads her out
as they move through a little courtyard area toward the street
you must learn english
why wont she learn english
im going to have to learn you must learn english in spanish
i think flor is perfect and we should do all we can to keep her from changing
gee you took the words right out of my mouthay
as she leads flor along the highway side of carbon beach passing houses until she sees a hispanic man washing someones car in a driveway
evelyn is many steps back
do you speak english
yes i do
would you translate for me
he looks at flor
he speaks to her in spanish
a lavish poetic compliment
flor in full control says in spanish
would you please just find out what she wants
evelyn joins them
wait till i say something before you start in
he looks at her i rented a house here for the summer and now she must sleep at the house because of the bus schedule
he translates along with deborahs speech
she turns to deborah
flor talks briefly in spanish
she cant because of her daughter
you have a daughter
you have a whole daughter you havent mentioned
to evelyn its a little crazy that i dont know that
the man translates
to man dont translate asides
the man says in spanish to flor
you work for her
flor answers just tell her that i cant live here
deborah doesnt like that the man has initiated more conversation
she cant live here
beat then big decision her daughter can also live with us for the summer
the man tells flor
she answers directly to deborah
big decision no sorry
the man asks flor who speaks in spanish
i dont know
she just doesnt want to
will you please just tell me what she said
she said i just dont want to
if she didnt tell us about her child she has to have a deep sense of privacy
we can figure out how she can still live at home
hell i dont mind driving her at night
lets spare the world you on the roads
to flor well what do we do
the hispanic man translates the last sentence
deborah and flor stare at each other
deborahs next words are somber and have enough body language to transcend the need for translation
the jig is up
big decision im sorry my friend this is what i need
its just for the summer
i dont want to lose you
flor indicates there is no need to translate
enormous decision yo vivo aqui
shell live here
the man says something in spanish to flor as she starts to walk away and she is thrown enough by the statement to actually stumble as she looks back at
then before deborah can admonish him
i said god protect you from that boss
as cristina trying to suppress her grin skips quickly down the stairs moving towards a truck from johns restaurant
flor follows tight lipped resolved
they each carry many clothes on wire hangers
a group of girls on the balcony literally cheer cristina on
accented cristina grins hugely back at them
the two women in the truck and then
as the truck leaves the tunnel and all is cliffs sand and waves
cristina taking it in unaware that her mothers eyes never leave her
she gasps frequently
major giant organic gasps of wonder and pleasure
this is awe as an active physical exercise
the moving shot dramatizes the crossroads of the mother daughter relationship as the two shot finds flor becoming first blurred then lost as we focus on cristina exclaiming over each
over this incidental dialogue the first time one sees natural beauty which is owned by others confounds the senses
i had never imagined the word money could be associated with anything but the anxiety of not having enough
i didnt know god had a toy store for the rich
the truck in the driveway
the women walking through a front door into a court yard
georgie in a swim suit talking to chum in the manner of people trying to excite dogs
who wants to go swimming
yes who wants to go swimming
the dog goes crazy with excitement then droll for a nine year old georgie turns to his grandmother who is sunning herself and reading and addresses her in precisely the
evelyn has a drink in hand
to grandmother who wants to go swimming
but i promise ill go in the summer after next
john enters the scene
you want to go swimming
oh yeah youre off
what do you think wet suits
wet suits are for wimps
yeah youre right
let me get mine
to dad youre good
behind flor and cristina as they move toward the claskys and their destiny
flor behind her daughter
as her eyes pop on seeing the clasky beach house
as her eyes pop on seeing the stunning twelve year old enter her home haloed by the sun
again flor less distinct in the background
bernice just outside the open patio door is putting on a shirt over her bathing suit as she looks at cristina and emits a small prescient moan
to flor look at this child
flor you could make a fortune at surrogate pregnancy
flor looks to her daughter for some understanding of what deborah said
cristina is as nonplussed by the remark as her mother
its good to see you
to flor indicating cristina great
to cristina hi
this is my daughter bernice
and out there
are georgie and
as she turns to gesture toward her mother and son evelyn has almost reached them
im so glad to meet you
im a fan of your mothers
as all acknowledge each other deborah tugs at bernies top which is half tucked in
kidding around but right on no comparisons please no comparisons
evelyn shoves her granddaughter for the self deprecation
flor says something to her daughter in spanish
my mother says its best if we get out of the way and put our things away
have you ever been to the beach here
ive never been anyplace but mexico and texas
john goes to a big toy box and opens it up
it is filled with beach paddles frisbees and boogie boards
heres the most important place in the house
grab this stuff whenever you want
delighted thank you
thank you so much
very little accent
to flor sin acento
her mom not crazy about the lack of accent to begin with nods
to deborah thank you
theres an a
total fluency class where they work you pretty hard at sounding american
flor doesnt want her daughter to have an extended conversation with deborah of which she doesnt understand a word
i am thrilled to be here
deborah has re decorated the room with casual brilliance
flor is tense
her daughter giddy
excited over the sheets the tv the pile of towels
she goes to work on her mother to go swimming
wanting her to appreciate the fun element of being here
the spirit of the kid such that flor relents
flor and cristina two sea nymphs lit by the floodlights from the beach homes
john and georgie in the waves
they get to shore
john sees the two females
dashing in the water in their bathing suits
he remains hidden in a very shallow wave as they run in
then once they are in he starts taking off his wet suit hurriedly
as he suffers the cold georgie enjoying every moment
wave lights still shining
on a dune sits cristina looking out
as deborah steps out on the deck and sees cristina
in a loud whisper hey cristina
what are you doing up
cristina looks around then up
i was just excited
would you believe i had to talk my husband into this
no reply then more pointedly would you believe i had to talk my husband into it
do you hear me
a shy laugh i didnt know what to say
still calling down do you want to come with me
im going to the flea market
i dont know what that
its the rose bowl
miles actual miles of great things for sale for gods sake
we can have brunch in pasadena
i dont want to wake my mother so early
ill leave her a note
ill as flor wakes
she goes to cristinas bed
atop the bed is a note
she picks it up
i decided to steal your daughter for a bit
with great energy born of bottled fury flor begins to go through her daughters things
finding her backpack and extracting a spanish english dictionary
as her finger points to steal
robar and then she flips some pages feverishly
her finger indicating daughter
hija stop thanking me
i love having the company
it was an adventure which ill remember
your english is genius
do you dream in spanish or english
just recently ive had a dream in english
what was it
i am so sorry
i uh cant tell
this is so uncomfortable
you could have just said you didnt remember
i uh guess so
but i do
look whos sensational
evelyn is sitting on the patio making sangria
she is pissed
she shows her the letter
evelyn reads it and hands it back
she is about to offer something
flor waves it off and enters the house
john comes in from the beach with his kids
evelyn hands him the letter
shes wild eyed over this
john moves after flor as bernie reads the letter
then quickly sorry about the word georgie
you want to know what happened
no thank you
he indicates his watch then holds his fingers together
they should be back soon
flor starts to cry
she sits in a chair
he sits not far from her
embarrassed she says in spanish to please leave her alone
she turns from him
he walks to the wet bar and gets a bottle of water
her crying soft in the
he walks to her sits near her and offers her the glass of water which she takes
deborah made a mistake
i understand how you feel
do you understand me at all generally
is simpatico the word
he pats her on the back
she looks at him
is he coming on
his kind eyes
this is real eye contact
two vaguely humiliated people finding real company for an instant
without thought she duplicates his gesture and pats his back
and when he seeks to add another pat he misses because she is out of her chair
this is as intimate as john has been with another woman since he was married
he calls out to stop her
un momento huh
she stops and turns to him
im really sorry this is happening
i just want you to know that
i am real sorry
he taps his heart as an indication of sincerity then a flash of worry that he has inadvertently come on to her
i didnt mean
he makes a gesture of ardent love
makes a person to person innocent gesture
she finds herself smiling
well the good thing about being an idiot is that every once in a while you cheer people up
got to get to work
as he exits
thinks about johns demeanor smiles again shakes it off as her mind fills with concern for cristina
deborahs suv loaded at the curb
she and cristina begin to carry things in
note cristinas hair has been restyled
evelyn bernie and flor are gathered in the living room
all staring at her
something bad happen
enormously anxious on reading her mothers mood
cristina tell your mother i just played around with your hair
she can put it back
no hurt feelings
not right now
flor puts an arm around her shoulder leading her off and speaking to her forcefully in spanish
you cant just take someone elses
nuh uh mom
dont go there
or ill go there and you know where there is
evelyn stops on a dime
deborah crosses to bernice who is highly concerned about flor and puts an arm around her
a pleasant surprise
can you believe what flor is making this into
shoot me if i ever get that hard to deal with
bernice unseen by mom does a long muted mock scream
music in action purpose energy
flor is dictating in spanish as cristina writes it down in english on a pad
cristina enormously uncomfortable
the pad in effect lends subtitles to flors words
cristina winces with the words she records even while punctuating perfectly
you cannot take my child without my permission
and if you had asked me i would not have given permission
is this why you did not ask
because you knew this
you have no rights over my private life
reaching a decisive conclusion
if you have any disagreement with this i no longer wish to work here
this is awful news
for a decisive nod of affirmation
she adjusts her daughters hair to the way it was takes the note and exits
flor enters in something of a fury and holds the letter out to deborah who hates being cornered in this manner
she actually places her hands behind her so as to avoid the note
flor shakes the letter at her
showing cristina hidden but looking on
like a stage prompter in the wings
flor with enormous emphasis stabs her finger at her own chest
you are not yourself
this was written in anger
you sleep on it and then if you still want me to have it fine
i dont think you will once calm and rational thought returns
just sleep on it
deborah exits to a bathroom and closes the door
leaving flor in the hall with the letter
cristina reveals herself and explains the situation to her mother
the last word we hear before scenes end is manana
deborah surreptitiously finishing putting on her running clothes and is making for the door when the alarm clock goes off and john awakens
she didnt even want us to know she had a daughter then on the first day you take the kid without asking
i think thats
starting to lose it what
slow and emphatic dumb
she looks at him
he has been atypical
her immediate emotional cocktail is panic fury and deep deep hurt
her words are slow
her voice ragged
when is anyone in this damn house or this damn life going to consider my feelings
i just tried to make a lovely kid feel welcome
theres no reason to rake it over
i let it go
and gave flor the room to let it go
which im sure she has
so get on board
she opens the door and almost runs into flor who is standing immediately in her way holding the letter
deborah stands over cristina who is writing in spanish a note deborah is dictating
as john passes through the room
i am deeply and sincerely sorry to have upset you
especially in light of the deep connection as women i believe us to have
sotto to john and to think i was worried about flor living here with her kid
john is talking to all three kids in an effort to lift the overall atmosphere
in the background we see deborah handing flor her letter
cristina taking sidelong glances
relieved to see them shake hands flor engaging hug flor reluctant
so heres the idea
i want to make a serving platter for serving fish using sea glass like this
he holds out some sea glass
i used to hunt for this stuff every free minute when i apprenticed in italy
this is bits of broken glass that the ocean sand blasts over the years
great looking huh
so you guys go hunting and ill pay cents for any piece a dollar for anything as big as this and five dollars for any color that isnt brown clear
do we have to do this
to georgie oh come on
georgie and bernice start off
come on cristina go get em
her eyes widen and off she runs intoxicated with being included and having the chance to make money
the kids combing through pebbles
georgie becoming bored and stopping
lots of people on their decks
hot tubbing sunning partying
rich people forming new yorker cartoons in the background as cristina continues to doggedly collect her sea glass
at one point she comes upon a teenage couple making out near a mass of pebbles and politely asks them to roll over so she can search the area
cristina collecting sea glass
illuminated by the surf lights of the beach homes cristina plugs away
john exits his door and steps to his car
as he is about to get in
he looks up and steps around to where she is
there is a battered wood table along the side of the house
she overturns a large bucket and a small mountain of sea glass spills on the table
feeling horrible no
you dont have to pay
dont worry please
instead of a platter ill just build a sea glass building and serve fish inside
why dont you count it and
i didnt sleep
so whats the damage
her eyes locked on his
dead serious it depends on whether you consider these four a color other than green brown or clear
she takes them from her pocket
well this one is borderline
oh my god you found a blue
nobody finds a blue
you know how a blue happens
i mean before the ocean blasts it for years
somebody had to throw away an old milk of magnesia bottle
you know what milk of magnesia is
he smiles broadly
the kids a trip
he likes her
so how much for the whole deal
unable to look at him eleven hundred and one dollar
well finish dealing with it when i get home from work
flor asleep cristina awake alert
she hears john enter
she moves slowly so as not to awaken flor
as she enters from the back room and sees that john is walking into the kitchen
her eye goes to the hall table on which there sits a fat envelope with her name on it
john enters the bedroom to find a note from deb that she will be late
he is disappointed
not aware of being observed
opens the envelope and takes out a thick wad of cash
as she goes about hiding it
she is jolted by her mothers whispered incredulity
the wad of money in her hand
the best chef in america has just fixed himself a snack as a salve to his spirits
its a little like dagwood bumstead as a culinary genius
this is a snack we will remember and copy
john is approaching a perfect moment
and this is a guy who appreciates simple pleasures to the fullest
he carries the brilliant snack to the living room and is just about to take his first bite when he hears emotional spanish voices approaching
he looks up
as they enter
cristina translating her mothers words
my mother wishes me to represent exactly what she says nothing else
and so for the remainder of the scene flor will speak in spanish and cristina will not only translate but render her mothers emotion sometimes including body language
it is not only a translation but a reenactment
may i talk to you
you mean your mother
not comfortable breaking the rule of only speaking for her mother
she faces him her back to flor
looking at flor sure you can talk to me
cristina begins translating as her mother speaks in spanish
i dont have to sleep first
flor waves the money
cristina waves an empty hand as she speaks for her mother
did you give this money to my daughter
i made this little deal
with all the kids to
flor advances on him past her daughter so cristina now translates from the background
you dont tell or ask the mother when you give a child a fortune for looking on the beach for stones
what is the word for this
on hearing the translation of sea glass an exasperated flor turns so that her back is to john as cristina admonishes him
not a name for the stones
a name for the act
what you did
as she spits out the word to her daughter
as his eyes shift to cristina fearing the word he will hear
engreidos going to be rough
reluctantly taking the emotional stance of her mother to deliver the word
briefly being herself its hard to translate
she takes half a beat
finds the word and now spits it out
john gets up and takes a conciliatory step toward flor so that now cristina is in the middle looking up at them as she translates for john i had no
idea it would amount to that kind of money
i thought sort of tops fifty dollars
fifty dollars is a lot of money
he has no idea where to take it from here the two females look as he searches for the right thing to say
sighing to himself ah shit
that fast cristina translates
before flor can react
john talks directly to flor
quiet compassionate a bit beaten
i get why you are upset
it might not look it but i am good at getting things
doing something about it is something else
i was going to talk to you before i actually gave her the money
but maybe i should have checked before i started the whole thing
he smiles they dont i know what its like when you feel your kid is being messed with
i get the message
it wont happen again
im sure wed all like
flor lets it out
her daughter hard pressed to keep up
if this was small enough to be helped by some little apology i would be a fool to bring it up
i need to say more no matter what the result
i need to be impolite
you leave someone elses child alone
its simple no
it is too easy for children to feel contradictions
it encourages questioning their parents
and that makes them less safe
your wife takes her for rides and changes her hair
you give her money
this next sentence cristina translates with alarm and adds her own question mark
take back the money
flor hands john the envelope under her daughters wrenching gaze
they begin to exit
but flor turns inadvertently bumping into her daughter
her voice softens
i did not mean to be angry to you only emotional
they turn to leave
john speaks with sudden volume and muscle
what about hypocritical
cristina turns back
her mother asks her for a translation and she complies
flor then wearing the same confused expression
yeah you heard me
its not like you didnt do the same thing
hard on the translation no
so go lecture yourself
you wont need a translator for that one
i mean what am i lately
a recycling bin
just anyone dump in your garbage and hope i make something useful out of it
flor is confused and getting pissed but he is moving now and pointing a finger at her
yes you did the same thing
you think i didnt know about altering those outfits for bernie
she tells me her stuff
so am i missing something
is there a real difference between that and what you are complaining about
cristina waits for a comeback from her mother to translate
but doesnt get one
instead her mother is a bit mortified and considerably humbled
the pie smack into the face
im still not sure i did the right thing keeping it to myself
it felt disloyal to deborah
but my daughter really needed someone to be kind to her right then
i am very embarrassed
you are very right
something strikes him he softens disoriented ill tell you its pretty wild to say something and have the other person just concede the point
im dazed here
i will leave whenever it is good for you and
come on man
but how can i work for you after we talk like this
you cant quit even if you want to and you know why
yes you do
flor is worried as john looks right at her
is he coming on
because then cristina will blame herself for costing you the job
and that guilt
i dont know if you know about guilt
cristina doesnt have to check with her mother on this one
culpa guilt si
we are catholics
after her daughters translation culpa si
por dios si
on her own we know
big nod we know
john gestures that there is nothing to be done
so welcome back
extends her hand
good night mr
good night as they exit
their backs to john daughter following mother
flor speaks to her daughter
an aside no te puedo tener haciendo esto por mi
ahora tengo que aprender ingles
over her shoulder to john as they move i cant have you doing this for me
i must learn english now
no dije eso por ti no por john
that translates to no i meant that for you not john
but cristina does not translate the line
you have a wonderful mother
a spanish commercial for learning english in a hurry is on television
flor on the phone ordering it
learning english would cost five hundred and ninety nine dollars down and monthly payments of one hundred and ten dollars
which represents percent interest
mexicans marketing mexicans
but not a penny was wasted
as flor takes a package from the box
my mother showed an extraordinary facility for learning the language
flor listening to the tapes as she does laundry
as well as a totally committed obsessive work ethic which blocked out all else
she was her daughters mother
as flor silently mouths some english while listening to a tape chum nudges her with a ball and without thinking she takes it from his mouth and tosses it
realizing with alarm a beat too late that she has broken the rule
flor sitting on the sand
listening to her tapes
continually forced by chums obsessive persistence to throw him the ball
as john arrives
he bumps the walls on entering
as john enters the house clearly drunk
there is the sound of skittering paws as chum approaches
cheering hey boy i can use some up company
but chum feverishly digs his snout against a nearby piece of furniture and retrieves a tennis ball and rockets away
john follows weaving a bit
as john enters the room to find chum proffering the ball to flor who is watching one of video language tapes
she tosses the ball without a look or a thought
then starts when she sees john standing there
he cheers seeing her predicament
when she speaks english at this point her words are halting
you gotta do something about chum
your arms going to go
she waves it off and hurries to get her tape and get out of his way
chum complicates the task proffering the ball
flor wearily throws it
dont you sleep anymore
you get more if you keep at it
youre doing fantastic
now i am like a three year old
your wife go out
she say where
on his reaction sorry
i just forgot she was going out
dont be a smart ass
jolted by his own remark uh oh
well you and i communicate mostly in apologies anyway
i should be whipped
i should be stoned its been a while i meant to say i think dont be smart dont be kind dont be sensitive dont be beautiful
i meant to say hi flor good night flor
that show youre watching is going to be a hit
he staggers out
flor watches his lonely back for a beat and then urgently gestures chum to join him
chum is reluctant but relenting runs and accompanies his appreciative master
flor now alone finds herself staring at a framed picture of john in the den
he is younger and smiling
she studies the picture and then blinks when she realizes her own emotion and purposefully goes back to her lessons
cristina and bernice waiting in line at the mexican fast food place on p
with the towering signature mexican male figure on its roof
deborah is parked curbside in the suv
howd you get your mother to let you go with my mother
well your mother just said she could use my help on a few errands while youre in class
then unconsciously moans
just that i hate summer school
why do you go then
looks at her im not sure i can explain to you the concept of not doing well in a class
in this case math
and the system kind of insists on the illusion that youve learned math so they make you go to summer school
it helps them avoid facing that they have failed in their mission
what do you mean they failed
forgive me i dont have a real sense of humor
looking skyward thank you god
on cristinas reaction joking
the joke is
as they get in the car
bernice doing a little stutter step offering cristina the front seat
as they get in
deborah privy to the conversation now
that youre better at everything than i am
and i was thanking god for there being this one thing where i might have my nose in front
deborah cant think of what single thing bernice could possibly feel superior about
she is genuinely puzzled
and that thing is
bernice deeply resents the question
she turns to her mother
ruefully to self that one even she knows is funny
cristina gives bernice an appreciative push from behind
deborah for some reason feels she deserves credit for their connection
look at you girls
deb working an outfit
her mother eyeing her
cristinas already read on her own everything on bernices summer reading list
and shes two grades behind
imagine if she went to bernices school
and theyd kill to give her a scholarship
talk to flor
shes so open to new things
deborah and cristina standing in a grass bordered parking lot
deborah feigning upset tearing into her bag but her focus is elsewhere as she periodically looks off
she is clearly stalling
cant find my keys
another woman arlene folsom calls to her
acting surprised hi arlene
to cristina come on
they walk to greet arlene
this is cristina
the girl im always raving about
this is arlene folsom
the school director
barbara boxer couldnt do it better hello
a pleasure to meet you ms
i couldnt believe how beautiful the grounds were as we drove in
i just think the balance of the buildings to open ground is so wonderful and must have been very difficult to achieve
deborah smiles with pride at the elegant first impression cristina is making
all are grinning
the two adults suspiciously so
sharing their delight
would you like a little tour
first showing cristina in foreground and her pov of this drop dead gorgeous rich kids school in the background and then we move closer on cristina
we see lust in her reaction
the experience was literally mind boggling
my mind did boggle
my cranial cells stunned
even if i had enough sense of wonder to imagine such a school existed my sense of fairness made it unthinkable that any school could offer this much more than
this is the last day of the summer rental many packed cartons on the floor
deborah flor and cristina engaged in a momentous conversation
note throughout the following and quite beside the point we see flor periodically make the motion of throwing the ball
but we do not cut to chum rather we just hear his claws skittering after the ball as we maintain focus on the momentous conversation
nuh uh flor you are not pinning this one on me
ive got to finish packing up
no longer sure of herself or anything i just dont
out of space this school wants her to go for free
we ran into the school head
they want diversity
cristina knocked her out
i had nothing to do with it
by the way the scholarship is worth twenty thousand dollars
and early registration is tomorrow
it is too far from our home
you could move in with us in town
never thank you
okay then dont
by the way
the phrase is no thank you
flor has her earphones on listening to her english tapes
but she is enormously upset as she watches her daughter passionately pray in english
soon taking off the ear phones
please dear god
enter my mothers heart and make her understand what this school would mean
summer session l
ninety percent hispanic
through flors pov the place is seen not as crowded and worn but as vibrant with community
highly anxious and out of place she sees the upper scale students
five percent latino
no brochure can do it justice
overwhelmed by the implications flors eyes tear
flor sits on her bed no thought of sleep
john enters home from work
as he passes flors door it opens and she steps out
before she can continue on she sees evelyn at the foot of the stairs carrying a glass of port
hi flor want some port
no thank you evelyn
going up stairs thanks for never judging me
thats whats killing me
she sees flor approach john
evelyn looks thoughtful
john is about to pour himself a stiff drink
flor startles him
may i talk with you
she nods deborah will be home soon
i just talked to her
i need real talk
is it okay
john does not answer immediately
the brief pause is noted
as they exit to beach with a nervous laugh you have me a little worried
he glances back hoping to have his fears assuaged they are not
she stands gorgeous
the wind gusts periodically blowing her dress against her body
he tries not to notice
you know about cristina and your great school
oh its happened
is it driving you nuts
i have no idea what to do
such an important thing
its a good school
so you like it
i hate the damn school
but thats because they keep sending my daughter home anxiety ridden mostly over geometry
i mean you get bernice
in a decent world her school should let her know how great she is right
so dont ask me
im worried about my own kid there
you dont have to worry about bernice
nothing is going to change that heart
he looks at her
out of nowhere overwhelmed by someone echoing and affirming his deepest most private thoughts about his daughter
it is odd
being this deeply touched before he knows what hit him
he makes little adjustments until the moment passes
then its great to hear someone else say that out loud
hard to explain
i get it
then deeply with core feelings a lament ah man
caring it will be okay
no i was thinking about you
instantly alarmed your ah man was for me
you think i am in trouble with cristina
its just tough to be sane
john contd to know youre not just making something out of nothing
that when you think youre at some crossroads you are
she takes this in nods i never know a man who can put himself in my place like you do
how do you become that man
i dont know
you introduce two jews in the desert and wait five thousand years
then bingo somebody else who can see trouble coming but cant do anything about it
i dont understand
i want to
i dont know what im talking about
a sustained gust of wind which celebrates her shape in a way which cannot be ignored
will you sit down
get out of the damn wind
so you going to send her
i dont know
but it does not feel good
i think if she goes there it will be one of two things
either she will be odd
or she will make herself the same as them
in wonderment that is exactly the way i felt about bernice going there
john contd i wasnt able to think it that clearly
but thats how i felt
so between odd and the same
you gotta root for odd dont you
yes you gotta
camera begins to pull back
early in the move johns words stop the movement
this was a crummy summer
flor nods ruefully
then suddenly off a glance at him
not all crummy
suddenly there is a bit of danger
she rises quickly changing mode
thank you good night
i go sleep
you speaking english
nice meeting you
she gulps and exits
as the camera pulls back
ending the summer at the rented house
as we transition to
through the unusual center window we see flor and cristina
flor at this moment is assimilating against every fiber in her body
cristina is excited certain her life is taking an incandescent turn
quite a contrast
as the bus stops
bernice is across the street along with some other kids and deborah who is wearing her running clothes
flor and cristina exit the bus
calling you just made it
i was getting worried
deborah has a backpack loaded with books which she hands to cristina
i picked up your books yesterday
by way of explanation to flor this is one of bernies old
cristina taking it
oh thank you
as she shoulders it and almost falls over
impressed with the heft this is a great school
to cristina i got you a little first day at a new school present
a school bus appears and heads toward them putting a certain deadline pressure on the transaction
its from me and
to flor okay
it is a big day
flors uncertain reaction is taken as a yes
dry what did we get her
deborah hands cristina a locket
then noting flors expression
to cristina its from all of us
your mother too
to cristina its not from me
deborah does a good natured take accepting flors reaction as if it where an eccentricity
as cristina and bernice board the bus cristina generally says goodbye to both women thereby depriving flor of her own moment of passage with her daughter
have a great year girls
for flor this is so great
it fills your heart doesnt it
deborah turns and sees flor has already started doggedly up the hill
walking up the hill blinking in disbelief at her own fury
deborah in the background feeling a bit abandoned
flor keeps walking toward the camera
there is a terrible crisis which comes when your own personality is not equal to the challenge you face
when being who you are no longer works
deborah has started to jog
as she approaches flor she calls for a clear path well in advance
flor does not alter course though she does start to walk faster
deborah is close behind now
suddenly flor breaks into a run
she is lithe and quick
a blink of confusion
then something resembling innate satisfaction as she quickens her gait and
the race is on
strangely she is interpreting this as closeness
she is genuinely warm
to flor why am i not surprised youre competitive
deborah looks up the street at a delivery truck
oh theyre delivering my table
flor stays on task
forces her stride
she just needs to win so very much
to her current surprise thats everything
you are fast
better pace yourself though
flor even more upset and provoked by the words now lets it all out
realizing she may not be a certain winner
she is concerned as she goes after the rabbit
showing the delivery truck as finish line in the distance
flor fueled by desperation
deborah relentlessly gaining exhilarated
decidedly anti climactic
deborah draws even passes her arrives at the house with a large margin of victory
calling back i love you for trying
she exits into her home
bent over hands on knees sweaty gasping for breath
flor finally straightens up and there being no other course continues her walk up the hill to work
when people exist under one roof a tiny society forms
the stuff of
narrator contd novelas masters and servants unconsciously dancing in lock step so that when things go wrong traumas converge
as john moves past evelyn on his way to work
she looks at him a little wild eyed as they both stand in the doorway
straining a bit for breath
you feel okay
ive given up drinking
he looks at her she sadly nods affirmation i had to do it john
i need every brain cell to watch out for all of us
given the current climate
john i think youre great and im going to act accordingly
totally confused good deal
flor cooking alongside monica a table is set for ten
a banner proclaiming bienvenida mama
my great aunt monica had finally managed to get her mother to los angeles and my mother was making a party
bernice sitting amidst cristina and two other golden girls as they arrive at the clasky home
i was with my friends who had helped me understand real optimism
as they pull in the driveway
cristina and her friends exit the car and squeal loudly at each other with the excitement of having it all
bernice exits last
she is not squealing
as deb finishes dialing a call
cristina looking on
her two friends watching a movie in the family room
a clock prominently reads nine p
into phone flor
look sorry to call you so late but theyre still studying and im going out but i promised to get her back so if you want me to cut off
the school work fine
whatever you want me to do
you think about it
she holds on to give flor time and hey if youre tired or want to play let her sleep here and ill get her back there tomorrow
you still want to think about it
she hangs up
and exchanges a mischievous look with cristina
as flor hangs up
though it is possible to judge harshly my conduct toward my mother in my first year at school almost all professional literature excuses my behavior as developmental since i was
entering an age where rebellion and narcissism were to be expected
and i was being mentored
monica and her newly arrived mother are there along with the bride from an earlier scene and some of the girls who saw cristina off to malibu
women cooking in the kitchen
she tells the girls in spanish that cristina may not make it
they are disappointed
flor thinks then says something to monica who nods in agreement
as evelyn stands there
a little in the shadows
deborah somewhat dolled up moving through the interior of the house
as deborah leaves the house in a hurry
calling out wait
deborah turns startled
i need to talk to you privately honey
cant now mom
i was looking all over for you
keep an eye on the kids
you know my secret cell number
just give me a moment to talk here
what is it
are you buzzed
i gave up drinking weeks ago
on deborahs reaction yes
nobody noticed which shows i probably conducted myself pretty well as a drunk
but duty called and im sober so may i say just one thing
deborah youre going to lose your husband and youll never find someone as good
there will only be men who you know are cheap and shallow and have no real warmth in their souls
you may have gotten by on those surfaces once but now youve been spoiled by a good man and you can no longer glide on such thin ice
if you do not act quickly you will soon cement an awful fate for yourself
a life with no hope of repair which has already begun to turn desperate and dumb
she grabs a deep breath and then turns and walks to the house
to herself if were out of coffee its over for me
suddenly a sharp horn is heard
then turns to see her daughter calling to her from the drivers seat of the youve done it again mom made me hate myself
one of the things i can count on
honey lately your low self esteem is just good common sense
deborah considers that last thought for a long beat before she drives off
flor walking from the beginning of the hill
she looks off to see johns vehicle approaching
who doesnt see her
we can see his cars digital clock reading
as he drives past her
as john enters
evelyn in an adjoining room moves to intercept him
john better wait a minute
but john hears debs crying from upstairs
concerned what the hells wrong
in all futility can i urge you not to go up there
but he is already moving quickly up the stairs
as he turns at the top of the stairs we see the door close to bernices
to herself denouement
john enters the room on the double
passes deborah without knowing it
she is partially obscured by the drape or some such
as he passes
camera holds on deborah
she is a mess
goopy tear stains
seeing him and his concern brings her grief to a higher ground
a sinner humbled by goodness
a trembling lip of childlike vulnerability
where are you
he is about to leave the room
she is about to let him but an instinct leads her astray once more
here i am
stay there john
i suddenly get what i have to do
i just have to get the guts
is it absolutely necessary to make it this
can you just say it
not so easy
tender ready for the big healing yeah
we can talk
do i ever hope so
ive been seeing another man for the last eleven weeks and it was nothing and i ended it tonight
at first it was just keeping an eye on the real estate market
then it was
me being insecure and looking for some ridiculous vali
a shock victim
he holds up a hand to stop her
go hold on
im missing what youre saying
you cant just keep talking and expect me to follow it when you start the way you did
just what did you hear
well there was the crack in the planet
that was noisy
she looks at him
a solid beat
theres an actual noise in my head
briefly he does the noise
slowly i met him about
john holds up a hand to stop her
he needs to gather himself to hear this
as he waits he grows flushed and stunned with dread
finally a word
she takes that as a cue to start
i met him
he puts up his hand
if you talk that fast
ill never hear you
theres a lot going through my mind
have you said yet whether you slept with him
so far ive just been talking about a flirtation because the really important thing for you to know
have you said yet whether youve had sex with someone else
because i really am missing most of your words
so help me out here
ive been trying to explain that for the first ten weeks there was almost nothing to
sincerely checking but wild you still havent said right
is this your way of
this is my way of
this is my way of asking you whether
staggering on the threshold of a diminished future
oh man once i ask it
give me a second
several beats then some conversational good manners for keeping her waiting im just trying to figure out whether theres any way to avoid knowing
no damn quickly closing this argument with himself theres not
to her okay youre on
real short answer huh
have you had sex with another
i know youre very angry
considering then repressed answer ahhhh
im getting there yes
on his look i think if you let me tell you the full everything of this wed be in a position to deal with it better
because eleven weeks ago when
you dont believe that i miss your words
i get three or four tops
and then just see your mouth moving with nothing coming out and then i spin out and theres this noise
but theres no way to miss a yes or no
core simple eight years old really
this gets her i made up my mind that i would answer every question you had
ill answer anything and everything and more
perplexed what other questions could there be
are you really that much nicer than me
well you dont set the bar real high
he get up and starts to exit
please please please
i think if you listen to exactly what happened and then do whatever you need to
just let me tell you everything
the doorbell rings
its quite late
deborah wondering whats up
she looks out the window
oh its just flor
as flor enters the clasky house
flor sees evelyn in the living room
what are you doing here
i want cristina
i want to talk to mrs
i want to quit
i dont think you can do any of it right this minute
deborah can barely look at him
then when i was driving back tonight after i ended the whole yuck thing
i was feeling human
im done with whats his name
and now it can be like it never happened and then i thought that the only hope was that i own that it did happen and that i take my
because if im walking around with what i did and you dont know what i did
there is a real limit to how close we can be
youre with me and im this person who has this bad secret and we arent really on the same page ever again
so the reason i took this chance in telling is because i want us to be good
i want us to be close
i want to feel like youre not nuts to be in love with me
so what i think is we should talk till we pass out
talk till were so sick of each other that theres nothing left to do but take the first step out of hell
so please lets not leave this room until youve heard and said everything
please say okay
she awaits his answer
he has heard barely a few words
ive got to get out of here
because you keep talking
as she starts to follow him stay put
just before he exits
youve got to say something
you are a terrible wife
evelyn stands in the doorway with flor
they are looking at cristina and her two friends sleeping together
i dont think you want to wake her when youre this upset and the other kids are right there and
flor makes a noise of frustration and retreats from the room
as they arrive at the interior entrance john comes down the stairs just as flor opens the front door
where you going
i have finally
ill drive you
its past midnight here
if you truly dont know why i say no let me at last say the reason
at least that will be a relief
have you no idea that i
before she can there is the sound of scratching toes on the floor and a ball comes into lower frame with a dogs snout
flor loses her thought and tosses the ball
as chum now the only happy creature in the house fetches it and returns
look i have to get out of here right now
john exits to driveway
flor makes one last toss
these tosses have not made a dent in her anger and frustration
another toss and flor follows john out the door
no longer happy
he has lost his only easy mark
he stares at the closed door
the ball drops from his mouth to the floor
john is at the car but flor heads for the gate
as decisive as weve seen him im taking you
with anger why
because if i dont ill worry about you and i cant handle that right now okay
flor emits a crooning sound
stunned and worried i never made that sound over a man before
flor shudders at her own sappiness as john opens the passenger door for her
very much into his own torture he nonetheless grabs her arm and guides her up and in
she catches and appreciates his automatic gracious manners while he is clearly fucked up
she is impatient with his solicitousness almost slapping his hands away as he makes sure her skirt doesnt get crushed in the door
the frustration roiling in her
deborah watching them
her cuckolded husband closing the door behind her gorgeous soon to be ex housekeeper
she trembles under the force of imminent justice
two pissed off people
as the car starts and flor looks back she lets out a guttural and explosive shout
a quick and mighty vent arrchhhhhyeeeeiii
for john the first clear thing he has heard in a while
teach me that word sometime
i can really use it
there is almost a moment of relaxation
then the anger fires an immediate need
she leans across the seat to deliver an urgent message to him
the words come out exponentially too forcefully
i quit this job
his spontaneous and forceful reaction surprises her
i quit this job
as he turns onto sunset
thats the bus stop
ill take you home
drop me at a bus
oh shut up and stop telling me what to do
then lets do something besides driving me home where my daughter isnt
well do something
and im supposed to figure out what because im a housekeeper and you dont have to think
oh dont do the class thing man
you dont know where i come from
alright i know
but i cant be responsible no more for making sure nothing happens
thats another terrible job i quit
what are you talking about
i take responsibility for anything within a block
you have nothing to worry about
thats my job
so youre going to figure out what we do right
big man figure out
she points to a mall
he looks at her and pulls in
as she leaves the car and goes into a drug store
john sober faced looks at flor making an attractive and zestful beeline toward an hispanic market
this could be where it hits him that hes on a date
its too late to duck
as flor enters the market
she calls to the young shop girl as marine medics for morphine
the shop girl directs her to the make up counter where she starts shopping
lip gloss blush eye stuff
she starts applying it at the check out counter
as she runs back to the car
as she enters there is a fury to her which he almost matches
this is me when im not working
you have never seen me
well you look familiar
so parodying him man where we heading
i dont think i can handle public
lots of people right now is
you were going to figure this out
as they enter the main restaurant
ive never seen your place
he heads for the kitchen
im going to cook beautiful
on a dime correction im going to cook beautifully
we both were not normal because we are angry and we act like we are angry with each other and we are not
i am not
i am glad to be with you
it feels comfortable to be with you
if i just left the job and never spoke with you it would have been sin
he stands next to her and for want of a better physical expression pats her on her back
she eyes him almost critical about the lame extent of his aggression
he cant quite look at her
he pats her again
the pat is becoming a rub
he cups her back
slides his hand
she responds just a bit
i think im inventing a horrible new way of making out
not so horrible
his hand keeps going
he now hugs her to him even though they both still face front
like a loving couple on a walk to the market
his hand squeezes her shoulder
my hand is the only sane part of my body
every other part wants to jump off a cliff
digging this almost growing a sense of humor if the other hand could cheer up you could lift me up and carry me off
he takes his hand from around her
it is a bit awkward
i dont know how to handle that one
i think i already broke my record for smooth
i dont understand
im not making sense
but i can get you fed
he goes to the kitchen
she begins to explore a little
she goes to a cabinet and opens it to find a cd player
she digs in her purse and takes out a cd
as john starts cooking up a storm
there is some velocity to his cooking
he still seethes
then reacts as spanish music starts to play
he clears his throat as if he must make a speech
then does so again
some vocal spasm paying tribute to the increasingly intoxicating tension he feels
flor is lighting the candle at each of the twenty tables
he is cooking
he is talking to himself
nothing to be nervous about
you are not on a date
calls out hey flor
what are you doing
she enters the room
dancing a bit
just lighting candles and picking music
notices his cooking oooh
she gets up on one of the counters and sits there her feet dangling
sings along a bit in spanish
he is uncomfortable anew
the nervousness mounting
you want a drink
she considers the question totally
he is busy cooking
not realizing how weighty she considers his question
finally aware she has not answered and looks at her
she regards him levelly
then makes her decision
he gets out a bottle of vodka
dont think you should either
then excuse me because if i had the equipment id inject the vodka
he starts to pour
he stops i think it is so important that we are each clear headed
he looks at her
he puts the vodka away
we have not seen her smile like this for quite some time
it is very good that you did not ask why
quietly keep things real right
impressed i wouldnt have put it so well
they sit at a small table in the kitchen
finishing the greatest late night meal in the history of western man
i will remember every taste
tell you the truth
i wanted a shot at cooking for you
shy his heart im very glad you liked it
its something watching you
he looks up at her
she has not been seen like this for a very long time if ever
lit up by a man
well if its anything at your end imagine over here
the last thing you want to hear is somebody going off on your looks
dont be crazy
tell me every detail
okay flor yes i will
they should name a gender after you
looking at you doesnt do it
staring is the only thing that makes sense
and trying not to blink so you dont miss anything
she squeals with laughter
he laughs a little himself and in so doing loses his courage
he looks down at his hands
shyness again belting him a good one
still looking down
its just that you are drop dead crazy gorgeous
so much so that i am really considering looking at you again before we finish up here
and now he looks at her
the half second before being swept away
we have to dance or kiss
he kids just a bit clowning at weighing the two options and then her face
you sure youre not mexican
smiling he likes this what do you mean
i meant you talk like a spanish song
you kiss like a spanish fly
on her confusion joking around
i dont know what im talking about
yes you do
she breaks and heads for the dining room
john has a moment to consider
he does not have his wits about him
a condition every bit as fearsome as liberating
as flor rummages for another cd enjoying every minute
she places the disk in the player and exits
as she returns
you see what a good thing to tell you how you talk like a mexican song
she begins to translate the lyrics
when i kiss you entire oceans rush through my veins
he is wildly uncomfortable gardens of flowers blossom in my body
he starts to make a comic gesture of awkwardness to get past the event
she shakes her head at him
driving the words pointing emphatically
she will not have her poetry laughed at
and you wander along my fertile soil picking its ripe fruit
a nightingale undresses on my tongue
and under its wings
she stops cold
though just seconds long this still constitutes the first depression of her life
i dont know what i just took out of you but tell me how to get it back in there
the downcast eyes rise to see him
then respect this
he looks at her
it is a kiss without an author
god at the controls
there is a beat then
heres something i never asked anyone
did nightingales undress on your tongue
flor looks at him with enormous warmth
her arms looped around his neck
aware of the music
did they on yours
a long beat of reflection then sincere and surprised yeah
the small house turned restaurant
little flickers of light
my mother never told me the details of her visit to the restaurant
but she often referred to it as the greatest conversation of her life
they are lying post coitally in each others arms on a sofa just inside the dining room
they are covered by a table cloth
they hold hands above the cover
each private but still somehow in contact
oh johnny why is everything so damn confusing
flors pleasure zone is rocked
she smiles at his first spanish word
she is wrestling with large feelings of pleasure and large ominous thoughts
a beat is your mind racing
i would say my mind has evaporated
but that there are remnants still standing waiting to fall
it feels pretty good
you think that will last
its already gone
i understand what you mean
i dont understand what i mean
that its getting late
that responsibilities have entered your brain
dont hide that from me
and really one large reason we are here is because you respect me as a mother and i respect you as a father
he is looking at her
she is disconcerted
youre a great and wild mother
you are a beautiful father
she looks at him
when cristina was young i would say i want to take any man who wants me to the park and i will tell whether i want him from the way
he is with cristina
i wish you had been in the park then
a beat any reaction
john considering and then the answer comes to him
you know i always think about when you
oh theres no point
i talk too much
a bit of emotion because i dont know if we ever talk again
how do you get there
yes you do
im being honest
indicates their bodies look at us i think i call it honesty
what are we going to do go home let our hearts go back in our bodies see each other a few more times
make a tragedy out of us
she kisses him again
starts to cry
looks at him
emits a small cooing sound
sudden energy there are some mistakes you cannot risk when you have kids
please are you ready to go
then stay put for a second
once our feet touch that floor im going to get too many brain cells back
so dont be in such a hurry
that floor flor is going to eat us alive
she settles back he is energized so you think it was a mistake up to now
she nods yes thats rough
she nods again
trying to gut things out
but as her foot touches the floor she must say one last thing to him
i love it
deborahs face is bleached from crying
the tear ducts of her now brown eyes are parched dry
evelyn sits eyeing her as she looks through the window at the pre dawn emptiness of stone canyon
in her current shape she would give pause to a staff worker at promises
a shock victim walking through the rubble after the bomb has dropped
deborahs voice is scratchy when she speaks
tell me again why i cant call him on the cell
besides that he turned it off
forty messages start to look needy
mother youre enjoying this
definitely not in the way you think
staggered you are enjoying it
rising honest i am enjoying actually being of use to my daughter
i am enjoying the fact that i really know how to advise you and the miracle that you are so deeply disoriented that you are gobbling up everything i say
deborah nods in agreement then looks at her mother in a somewhat new way
as if evelyn were an actual person instead of an upsetting extension of herself
vulnerable theres one thing id like to say to you about you and me
you dont have to
i want to
quite vulnerable and appealing you were an alcoholic and wildly promiscuous woman during my formative years so that i am in this fix because of you
it is your fault
i just needed
gestures heart to heart that moment for us
you have a solid point dear
but right now the lessons of my life are coming in handy for you
theres a car coming
evelyn moves to her
hes got to tell me everything
evelyn shakes her head no
wild eyed yes
do you know that right now you are your own worst enemy
that you cant trust one thought in your brain
then trust me and only allow yourself to say one thing to him
im so glad youre back
babbling but ive got to know whether he touched her where he touched her how he touched her if they broke a sweat what they said who made the first
move how they left it if anyone loves anyone or has an intention of making contact in the future what she wore how he felt afterwards whether anyone mentioned me
a wail whether they held hands when they left
the distinct sound of a door opening and closing from downstairs
just those words i said
if you want a prayer of coming out of this
i know youre right
a small voice i forgot the sentence you said i should say
im so glad youre back
do i have to wait here
he may not come up here
go to him
why wouldnt he come up here
do i need a little makeup
you need a hose but you dont have the time
its fine that you look like that
you can use genuine
thank you mom
she takes a breath exits
she pauses at the top of the stairs
then unable to help herself runs down them at breakneck speed
john turning a light on when deborah bursts into the room
im so glad to see you correcting self that youre back
john looks up at her not knowing what to say
he is thrown
his demeanor has changed
its late deborah
the wrong words start to form
she stops herself
well i just wanted to say
what i said
she is on the stairway
he turns to go in the opposite direction
way too loud uhhhh
he turns back to her
she stops herself from straying into untried words but gestures whether he is coming upstairs to bed
a beat then i cant sleep upstairs with you
just cant for now
this rocks her
panicked she grabs at her life preserver
im just so glad youre back
deborahs suddenly classy demeanor provides just the barest of footings for them
he looks at her directly for the first time since she told him
then goes back up the stairs
evelyn who has been standing close to the doorway stands clear to let her enter
as deborah flies in wildly vulnerable her breath racing
i am literally choking on unsaid words
if this were a restaurant ten people would have their knuckles in my sternum
the fact that you didnt just make things worse should fill you with hope
in her current state she has to process that one
her breath slows
the first time weve seen this room since flor was working the sewing machine
he is down longing and finality make for a brutal cocktail
he rubs his head and sits near the sewing machine
he glances over and sees flors spanish english dictionary
there is a knock on the door
deb im done tonight
i dont think we can jam anything else in
its me dad
he springs from the bed and opens the door
whats up honey
just thought id check that you were back and okay and all
feigning innocence because
mom was crying for six hours straight and grandma was in with her all that time mostly saying hell be back
hell be back
ive got to get back to georgie
i just hate that you had that kind of a night
its good for me to worry about something that really matters instead of the stupid stuff thats usually on my mind
a big grin surviving
youre fantastic bernie
i love you
its a slant
pause then hey
i know theres a lot you went through but i knew all along that grandma was right about you coming back
i mean totally knew it so i wasnt that worried
but still i
some emotion out of hiding i really appreciate it dad
stop staring at me
you dont know what to say
i dont know what to say
just what you taught me
flor purposefully walking up the hill
as flor enters
walks through a few empty rooms
then once in the kitchen she sees the children and evelyn are swimming in the pool
she opens the glass door monica bumped into on interview day
evelyn bernice and georgie are in the pool
cristina wearing a bathing suit is on a chaise reading
is it okay if we dont leave right away
the others call greetings
save evelyn who studies the situation and gets out of the pool
flor is awkward
no idea how to handle this
so she goes direct
as cristina begins to protest no
and we must say goodbye
i dont work here anymore
she then talks spanish to cristina
admonishing her not to embarrass them
something about flor being prepared to go nuts all over her daughter if she hurts their dignity
but it is said with total calm
do i have to get out
i think you are a wonderful boy
like you are
there are no monsters
bernice climbs out of the pool
meanwhile a flabbergasted cristina is staring at her mom who gives quiet two and three word proddings in spanish
severely to georgie i cant believe you didnt get out
to flor i dont want to get you wet
get me wet
rushing to hug her thanks
bernice hugs her
evelyn hugs cristina
to bernice youre a beauty
despite herself bernice starts to cry
moans to herself over the display
now in the background we hear a subliminal human voice
incrementally it will grow louder and be recognizable as deborah calling flor from the master bedroom window
bit by bit the others will become aware of this as flor ignores it
bernice goes to embrace cristina
my last chance to have some of you rub off on me
cristina doesnt understand im sorry youre so sad but this could have been so much worse
from her depths how
and now deborah calling flor is getting hard to ignore but flor manages
to cristina why dont you run upstairs and say goodbye to deborah
flor flashes a look of thanks
ill be in front
upset cristina runs off
she kisses bernice
and walks toward the house
as she passes under the bedroom
please come see me
and then a crying cristina appears on the deck
flor glances up and keeps moving underneath the deck where she faintly hears the beginning of their exchange its okay honey
well see each other at school
im going to keep an eye on you
flor enters the house
she stands waiting
walks to the hallway and cranes her head to see into rooms wondering if john is there
finally as she passes the stairwell she sees cristina on an upper landing and says in spanish that cristina should get her things and meet her out front
cristina agitated moves off to comply
then deborah appears in the same spot
please stick your head in here for a minute
flor nods and starts up the stairs
deborah holds open the door while flor walks inside
then closes it
whats with avoiding me am i this horrible person
as flor just looks at her
its a ridiculous question but sometimes im ridi
its a good question
a fine question
beat then i was just thinking to answer
werent we close
like a shot no
truly hurt well im very very disappointed to hear that
it makes me feel like a fool
compassion forces a crumb we werent close
but we were connected
in a bad way
strangely soothed you know something i think were saying the same thing
look as long as were doing closure
what did you and my husband john do last night
flor pauses for less of a beat than we would have imagined
i can only tell you what i did
that will be sufficient
these are tender feelings i became sure of what an incredibly lucky woman you are and i must make myself not envy you which is hard
no its not hard
i am exhausted
same here believe me
deborah would hug
but its only an eighth of a gesture because flor has turned to exit calling for her daughter to hurry as she goes
as she exits the house and moves to the gate where she punches in the exit code
as it swings open to reveal john
as she moves alongside him and the gate closes behind her
i was hanging out here waiting
cant give you guys a lift
flor shakes her head no
she looks away for a beat so the next thing she does is a considered action
she leans forward and kisses him on the lips
john looks at her
this is killer
on her confusion incredibly hard
the gate opens and a sniffling cristina is holding an armful of loot
reading flor let her have it
bites back some emotion and turns from him
i am very sorry we will not see each other as frequently
she offers her hand which john shakes while patting her on the back
they turn and begin walking down the street
the women walking toward camera john briefly in the background
as they begin their walk flor begins talking in spanish
the first minute we were alone my mother told me that i would no longer go to the private school
i wont be able to forgive you
it will be the end
i wont let you
and then cristina moves her hysterics to spanish as she stops walking and her mother takes her hand and pulls her along with enormous dedication
camera begins a pull back
cristina dropping presents
picking them up
one of them left by the wayside
cristinas conduct violating tacit zoning laws
so we can see their faces in the struggle
as they wait
flor talks sharply to cristina to control herself
my mother changed our lives once more
this time because she saw in me to her great alarm a character flaw of some size
she has taught me to be a watch dog of my character to control my ambition
i am not quite there
one last yelp from cristina as the bus arrives
almost empty its saturday
mother and daughter sit together by the giant window in the center of the bus
cristina eyes her mother who is bearing her own heartbreak with stoic dignity
the girl is becoming less inconsolable and more in need of mothering
for that reason should you choose to grant me your scholarship my mother at my request will be relocating to the new york metropolitan area so that she can stay
close during my time at princeton
cristina moves closer to flor who senses it immediately and wraps her in her arms
kisses her head
i hope my essay has done her justice
i love her with all my heart
