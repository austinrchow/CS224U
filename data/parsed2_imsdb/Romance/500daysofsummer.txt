written by scott neustadter michael h
weber first draft with a girl
when all is said and done up comes a single number in parenthesis like so for a few seconds we watch a man s and a woman s on a
their names are tom and summer
neither one says a word
close on her hand covering his
notice the wedding ring
no words are spoken
tom looks at her the way every woman wants to be looked at
a distinguished voice begins to speak to us
this is a story of boy meets girl
the boy is tom hansen
he sits at a very long rectangular conference table
the walls are lined with framed blow up sized greeting cards
tom dark hair and blue eyes wears a t shirt under his sports coat and adidas tennis shoes to balance out the corporate dress code
he looks pretty bored
the boy tom hansen of margate new jersey grew up believing that hed never truly be happy until the day he met his
pre teen tom sits alone on his bed engrossed in a movie
his walls are covered in posters of obscure bands
from the tv we hear elaine
this belief stemmed from early exposure to sad british pop music and a total misreading of the movie the graduate
the girl is summer finn
she files folders and answers phones in a plain white office
she has cropped blonde hair almost like a boys but her face is feminine and pretty enough to get away with it
the girl summer finn of shinnecock michigan did not share this belief
teenage summer stares at herself in the mirror
her hair extends down to her lower back
since the disintegration of her parents marriage shed only loved two things
the first was her long blonde hair
she picks up scissors from the counter and begins to slice
the second was how easily she could cut it off
and feel nothing
on the right side of the screen tom continues to listen to some boring presentation
on the left summer answers a call takes a message and walks out of her cubicle down a long narrow hallway
tom meets summer on january th in a san francisco office building
in an instant he will know shes the one hes been looking for
cu summer opening the door to the boardroom about to come face to face with tom for the first time
this is a story of boy meets girl
but before they do you should know up front this is not a love story
a year old girl rides her bicycle down the block
she arrives at an apartment complex jumps off the bike and races up the front stairs
she rings the doorbell
paul and mckenzie open the door
these are toms best friends since birth
paul is a doctor and wears hospital scrubs
mckenzie works in the cubicle next to tom
i didnt know who else to call
the girl removes her bike helmet
you did the right thing
where is he
tom is in the kitchen breaking things and basically going insane
about to smash a plate on the floor hes interrupted
what are you doing here
im here to help you
help me how
first put down the plate
tom slowly obliges
now come here and sit down
tom sits next to the young girl
paul and mckenzie sit on either side of them
the key is not to panic
i think im gonna be sick
she hands him a glass of water
tom drinks it down
what is that
grimacing at the taste more
he gulps another down
does mom know youre here
its gotta be past
dont worry about it
start from the beginning
tell us what happened
tom takes a deep breath
tom and summer eat sandwiches in the park
we spent the whole day together
tom and summer walk through the stalls
we went shopping
tom and summer seated outside drinking coffee
he reads the newspaper she reads a novel
we had coffee
tom and summer walk out of a movie theatre
we saw a film
tom and summer shop for music
tom excitedly shows summer a ringo starr solo album
we bought music
i thought it was a great day
and then what happened
tom and summer in a booth ordering dinner
to waitress um
you know what
lets go crazy ill have both
to summer god i love eating pancakes at night
its like the greatest thing ever
how great is this
i think we should stop seeing each other
just like that
just like that
did she say why
this whatever it is
you and me
do you think this is normal
i dont know
who cares about normal
arent you happy
all we do is argue
that is such a lie
maybe she was just in a bad mood
a hormonal thing
to rachel what do you know about pms
more than you
oh my god
this cant be a total surprise
i mean weve been like sid and nancy for months
summer sid stabbed nancy seven times with a kitchen knife
weve had some disagreements but i hardly think im sid vicious
so im nancy
the waitress comes out with the food
tom and summer stop their discussion until the meal is served and the waitress leaves
summer starts to eat
lets just eat and well talk about it after
without another word she goes back to her pancakes
tom watches her eat like this is the worst travesty in the history of mankind
mouth full mmm youre so right
these are great
tom looks at his food in disgust
he may never eat again
tom stands up to go
youre still my best fr silence for a few beats
i dont know what im gonna do
youre gonna be fine
im gonna throw up
tom drinks more vodka
come on hansen
youll be ok
youre the best guy i know
youll find someone
you know what they say
theres plenty other fish in the sea
sure they do
they say that
well theyre wrong
its not true
ive fished in that sea
ive jumped in and swam in that sea
im fucking aquaman
to rachel sorry
what i mean is
there are no other fish
this was my fish
paul and mckenzie share a very concerned look
tom walks alongside his friend paul
out of nowhere he says im in love with summer
i love her smile
i love her hair
i love her knees
i love how one eye is higher up on her face than the other eye
i love the scar on her neck from this operation she had as a kid
i love how she looks in my clash t shirt
i love how she looks when shes sleeping
i love the sound of her laugh
over black play the middle of every little thing she does is magic by the police
i love how i hear this song every time i think of her
i love how she makes me feel
like anythings possible
like i dont know
like life is worth it
paul and tom
for real paul
im madly in love with that girl
paul is silent for a beat
tom as we saw him earlier
in the boardroom
mckenzie is in mid presentation
now i know this may be a little risque
but if new hampshire greetings wants the jump on those conservative right wing neo nazis at hallmark maybe playing it safe is the wrong approach
the nuclear family is dead and we need a new holiday to recognize that
mckenzie holds up a home made photoshopped family portrait of martina navratilova ellen degeneres and the kid from jerry maguire
other mothers day
the co workers nod and digest this idea
vance is the head of the department
thats an intriguing idea mckenzie
along with grossmans magellan day id say weve got some potential here
what do you think hansen
could you write up some prototypes for these
tom is about to answer when
the door opens
excuse me mr
theres a call for you on line
and in walks this girl
weve met her by now but tom hasnt
this is the first time
his eyes go wide and from that moment on he cant take them off her
to the table everyone this is summer my new assistant
summer just moved here from
well summer everyone
excuse me i have to take this
nice to meet you all
summer gives a little wave before following vance out
she doesnt notice tom whose face looks like hes just seen god
tom trying to work
he turns to mckenzie
what do we know about this new girl
the new girl
in vances office
i hear shes a bitch from hell
patel tried to talk to her in the copy room
she was totally not having it
maybe she was just in a hurry
and maybe shes some uppity better than everyone superskank
shes pretty hot
that makes me so mad
why is it pretty girls always think they can treat people like crap and get away with it
like just cause she has high cheekbones and soft skin
and really good teeth
and maybe the worlds most perfect breasts
just cause of that stuff she can walk around like shes center of the universe
as explanation women
you know what
we havent even met and i cant stand her already
tom is listening to headphones
summer enters the elevator and tom actively puts on a show to ignore her
summer hears the music
tom pretending not to hear or care gives her an unenthusiastic wave
i love the smiths
tom still pretending takes off his headphones
i love the smiths
you have good taste in music
a beat as tom processes this information
you like the smiths
to die by your side is such a heavenly way to die
the elevator doors open and she gets off
accidentally out loud oh my god
the office sings happy birthday to a female co worker
when they get to the part about her name tom is the only one who knows it everyone else just there for the cake
song over everyone digs in
tom finds himself standing next to summer
so uh summer
hows it going so far
the city or the firm
still getting situated
how long have you worked here
oh you know
did you always want to write greeting cards
are you nuts
i dont even want to do it now
what is it you want to do
i studied to be an architect actually
thats so cool
eh you know
same old story
moved to the city to work for a company
company went under
needed a job
my friend worked here
got me this
and are you any good
points to a framed card well i wrote that one
today youre a man
mazel tov on your bar mitzvah
its a big seller
i meant are you any good as an architect
i doubt it
well id say youre a perfectly adequate
greeting card writer
why thank you
thats what they called me in college
perfectly adequate hansen
they used to call me anal girl
tom does a spit take and almost chokes
i was very neat and organized
theres an awkward silence
anyway i should get back
ok well ill see you around
she walks back to her cubicle at the other end of the hall
tom watches her walk away completely enamored
he sits down at his desk and sets out to work
but before he does his eyes fall on a sketch he drew of a house
its dated and its the only architecture sketch on his wall
tom is playing playstation with rachel
and it turns out shes read every graham greene novel ever published
her desk is lined with magritte posters and edward hopper
were so compatible its insane
it doesnt make sense
shes not like i thought at all
just cause some cute girl likes the same bizarro music you do doesnt make her the one
of course it does
sarah s tom and rachels mother stands in the doorway
pause and come eat
tom enters the living room area and sits down next to his stepdad martin s a quiet professorial southern gentleman type
angle on rachel and sarah
he met a girl
sarah grows serious too
the wright brothers galileo heavens gate neil armstrong
when one strongly believes in something it takes overwhelming contradictory evidence to change their minds
little tom age mesmerized by a vinyl album cover of olivia newton john in xanadu
tom had always been a devout believer in the idea of true love
the evidence did not support him
little tom stares at a little girl who has the same hairstyle and dress as newton john on that cover
tom draws a picture
its a boy and a girl with a giant heart over them
he stands up and walks over to the girl putting the picture on her desk
not a word is spoken
satisfied he returns to his seat and waits to see what happens
exhibit a lisa rayner
the little girl stands up and walks the picture over to tom is mortified
the other boy eats the drawing
a blonde cheerleader leads the crowd in a cheer
pan across to find teenage tom finishing making out with a homely high school girl
he says goodbye and walks off looking back longingly
exhibit b wendy wilson
once tom is out of frame a second boy approaches wendy
then they start making out
college tom sits next to his girlfriend rebecca myles
his smile gleams
im so glad we decided to go away together bec
i know weve only been dating a few months but its been
exhibit c rebecca myles
and now you and me days in mexico
best spring break ever
across the aisle rebecca makes eye contact with three college i think we should see other people
younger tom sits in the passenger seat
raven haired amanda drives
exhibit d amanda heller
last week you said you loved me
i know its sudden but
no this cant be
everything was going so great
i dont understand
she puts a disc into the cd player
because youre like the biggest music nerd ive ever met i think this should really help explain where im coming from
a pop song begins to play on the stereo
they listen for a few beats
tom is confused
you remember how much i loved this song when you first played it for me
its all you wanted to listen to for weeks
and i still like it dont get me wrong
when i hear it now i dont feel the same
still confused ok
i press the skip button
still tom doesnt understand
what does this have to do with
id rather listen to something else
and with that it slowly sinks in for him
this is a great fucking song
tom removes his headphones and sits defeated with mckenzie and paul in a booth
me and summer
was it ever on
but it could have been
in a world where good things happen to me
yeah well thats not really where we live
so what happened
you ready for this
tom is alone
the door opens
in walks summer
so there we are
nine more floors to ride
plenty of time
this is my chance
if not now when right
they ride in silence for a few beats
so how was your weekend
it was good
the friends wait for more
you believe that shit
i think i missed something
it was good
she didnt say it was good
she said it was good
emphasis on the good
she basically said i spent the weekend having sex with this guy i met at the gym
what the hell is wrong with you
dude you got problems
shes not interested in me
theres nothing i can do
it was good
and some other things
like what she said hey instead of hi cause that totally means shes a lesbian
i gave her all sorts of chances
tom types at his desk
summer approaches the cubicle tom shares with mckenzie
im going to the supply room
anyone need anything
i think you know what i need
theres a beat
oh ok sure no prob
the office is emptying out
only a few people remain but tom and summer are two of them
tom takes this opportunity to put a cd in his computer and play the song really loud
its i want to know what love is by foreigner
no reaction from summer
tom turns it up
tom turns it down defeated
tom is there
do you want to go out with me
summer says nothing
and the priest says but were already out
they both laugh
that is hilarious
and when she walks away he smacks his head a few times with his palm
not once did she take the bait
im done with her
toms friends all look at him like hes crazy
tom sits at his desk with headphones on trying to work
but with summer down at the end of the hall hes having a hard time concentrating
mckenzie shares a cubicle with tom
bucks all you can karaoke at the well
no way mckenzie
take me down to the paradise city where the grass is green and they got big titties
they wont let you back in there after last time
i wasnt that bad
not at all
you just threw up on the stage tried to fight the bartender and then threatened to burn the place down before passing out on the sidewalk
quiet night for you
you saved my life that day
we are not going back there
this is a work thing tommy
it wont be like that
the whole office is going
i really cant
even if i wanted to
theres a lot of stuff i gotta take care of
youre not listening to me
the whole office is going
tom looks over to where summer sits
and realization dawns on him
summer is in a back booth with some co workers when tom walks in to the crowded place
mckenzie has the microphone and hes singing every rose has its thorn by poison
hes real into it and well its kinda sad
tom waves to mckenzie and walks over to the booth
they said you werent coming
you asked if i was coming
my plans got cancelled
tom is at a loss
theres yet another awkward silent beat between them
thankfully its interrupted by
already drunk goddamn that song is brilliant
whats up hansen
summer sees the next song come up on the screen
ooh thats me
she downs a shot and jumps up on stage
into mic ok
im the new girl so no making fun of me
her co workers whistle and cheer her on
she takes a deep breath as the opening bars of born to run begin to play and summer starts to sing
tom sees summer as the actress in whatever nonsensical karaoke video accompanies the song its something to do with an old convertible the sunset and a midget in a tuxedo
tom sits in the booth with mckenzie doing a shot as summer chats with co workers at another table
tom cant help but stare at summer
she notices and waves
he smiles hopeful that shell come over
he hides his disappointment
tom walks back to his table with drinks
summer is there in mid conversation with mckenzie
you were great up there by the way
well you cant go wrong with the boss
sitting down i hear that
hey did you know tom heres from jersey
lived there til i was
i named my cat after springsteen
whats his name
that makes sense
shes really cute when she laughs
so you got a boyfriend
tom shoots daggers at mckenzie for that comment
mckenzie mouths what
summer sees nothing
dont really want one
i dont believe that
you dont believe a woman could enjoy being free and independent
are you a lesbian
no im not a lesbian
im just not comfortable being somebodys girlfriend
i dont want to be anybodys anything you know
i have no idea what youre talking about
it sounds selfish i know but
i just like being on my own
relationships are messy and feelings are always getting hurt
who needs all that
were in one of the most beautiful cities in the world
summer contd i say lets have as much fun as we can afford and leave the serious shit for later
what if you meet someone and fall in love
you seriously believe in that stuff
of course i do
a real romantic
oh you have no idea
there was this one girl to tom i gotta tell this story tom elbows mckenzie hard in the ribs to shut him up
summer hold on
you dont believe in love
i dont even know what that word means
i know ive never felt it whatever it is in all those songs
and i know that today most marriages end in divorce
like my parents
well mine too but oh yeah and i read in newsweek there were these scientists who found that by stimulating a part of the brain with electrodes you can make
a person fall in love with a rock
is that the love youre talking about
why whats your take on it
an animation sequence real quick
an explosion of many on tom i think its
kind of a huge thing
looks like were gonna have to agree to disagree on that one
mckenzie senses some discontent
so uh whos singing next
re singing id say its your turn loverboy
i dont sing in public
sure you do
i see you lip synching to your headphones every morning on your way in
you really do
i like it
takes a lot of self confidence to look ridiculous
cant help himself self confidence
tom elbows him in the ribs again
anyway im not near drunk enough to sing in front of all these people
it would take at least ten shots to get me to sing
ten minutes later
tom is up there singing the clashs magnificent seven
you wouldnt think so but tom is a rock star up there
hes dancing like jagger hes got everyone in the bar singing along to the audience participation parts
its a sight to behold
summer is all smiles watching
tom and summer back at the table
summer is humming something
thats not it
what is that then
i have no idea
theyre both having a good time
i used to watch it every week
why cant we think of the stupid a team theme song
this is gonna bother me for weeks
they share another laugh and then it gets quiet
in that good way
angle on mckenzie wasted singing the shit out of proud to be an american
he really means it
at any minute he might start to cry
and id proudly stand up
aggressive drunk i said stand
back on tom and summer
oh here we go
tom helps a nearly comatose mckenzie exit the place
summer is with them
to summer this guy
hes the best
ok lets get you in a cab
im gonna walk
i live right down that street
or that one
is he gonna be ok
hell be fine
a cab arrives
tom and summer help mckenzie inside
beat to summer he likes you
ok goodnight mckenzie
likes you likes you
tell her tom
tom shuts the door on mckenzie as fast as he can
now its just tom and summer
tom talks a mile a minute to try and erase mckenzies last exchange from her mind
sorry you had to see that
happens every time we come here
something about that guy and singing for people
i dont know
but at least he didnt is that true
you know what
i like you
of course i do
as a friend
as a friend
just as a friend
the wheels are spinning in toms head
whats the right answer here
i havent really thought about
id like us to be friends
is that ok
tom was clearly hoping for her to say something else
he hides his disappointment the best he can
oh yeah totally
you and me
well im that way
good night tom
tom watches her walk away for a beat before he turns to go the other way
under his breath friends
thats just great
well done hansen you idiot
tom walks a few more steps
and then seemingly out of nowhere without his even noticing summer has wrapped her arms around him and pulled its unbelievable
theres a few seconds where tom isnt sure if hes dreaming or not
but then he realizes suddenly out of the blue his best case scenario really is actually happening
fade up you make my dreams come true by hall and oates
its the greatest morning of all time
tom walks down the street
or more accurately tom struts down the street
hes pointing at people as he passes winking doing a little shuffle
he is the man
he checks out his reflection in a window
a young paul newman stares back
people wave as he passes they clap they give him thumbs up
a parade forms behind him
the postman a police officer the hot dog vendor ronald mcdonald and mayor mccheese everybody loves tom today
hall and oates themselves walk with tom singing the song
cars stop at crosswalks to let tom go by
the drivers also pump their fists in celebration of toms achievement last night
he walks on the man
we notice the sidewalk lights up every time he touches the pavement like in billie jean
cartoon birds fly onto toms shoulder
he smiles and winks at them
tom passes summers office whistling hall and oates
she sees him and immediately lights up
vance pokes out of his corner office
summer i need oh hello hansen
and theyre all business
as tom turns to go however summer gives him a little coy smile that would be enough to make anyones day complete
tom gives her the international signal for ill call you later in return
vance sees none of it
tom walks to his cubicle still on top of the world
tom answers the door
its paul in hospital scrubs
you son of a bitch
he walks inside without waiting for an invite
last night karaoke night
the same girl youd been whining and crying and bitching about for weeks now
i have not been
the same girl you said was way out of your league and youd have no chance with no matter what
did you bang her
no paul no jobs
im still unemployed
we just kissed
come on level with me
as your best friend who tolerated a whole month of talk talk talk about this girl nothing but summer this summer that summer summer summer i mean you were practically
suddenly the sound of a toilet flushing is heard
from the bathroom emerges summer dressed to go out
hi im summer
summer wow what an unusual name
im sure id remember that if i had heard it before
tom how come youve never mentioned you knew such a lovely little lady
off toms nasty look or perhaps you have and ive just forgot
to summer i mean with all the women in toms life its hard to keep track
not helping ok well i was just
not sure what else to im a doctor
nice to meet you
anyway im leaving now
pretend i was never here
tom talk to you later
hey if any jobs open up
tom quickly shuts the door on paul
if you heard
you ready to go
im stalking starving
tom realizes shes heard it all
tom and summer eating not really talking much
at another table tom sees a very unattractive couple feeding each other food
check them out
she has no reaction
that is hot
summer keeps eating
i am very turned on right now
sometimes you can be so judgmental
i mean who are you
just mind your own business
summer goes back to eating
tom cant believe she snapped
an equally unattractive couple go at it in a booth
pan across to find tom and summer early in their relationship in a booth across the room watching in hysterics
too soon to say
its all in the dismount
if were lucky there wont be a dismount
summer her cheeks flushed already from laughing loses it again
they are having a great night
i cant believe them
i have like zero patience for pda
i hear ya
if i want to watch people make out i have big windows and binoculars at home
that would be wrong
they laugh some more
she is in hysterics
this is fun
i mean i just want to say up front im not looking for anything serious
tom is a little surprised
are you cool with that
it freaks some guys out when i say that
still confused not me
lets just have fun
hang out no pressure no labels no obligations
tom is visibly disappointed by this but he tries to hide it
wanna hold my hand under the table
summer and tom come bounding in lip locked and all over each other
they fall on his bed and begin undressing each other
suddenly tom stops
back in a sec
he walks into the hallway out of her sight
he looks into the hallway mirror
dont get too excited
shes just a girl
theres lots of them
who look like that
and like what you like
he takes a few deep breaths
are you calm
then its time to go back in
we watch from behind as he re enters his bedroom
where summer waits
under the covers
oh sweet jesus
tom cant help but do a little celebration dance
sex has been had
summer is asleep
tom lies next to her
he still cant help but be ecstatic
he is pumping his fists in the air and silently shouting woo hoo
into camera i fucking hate summer
cu summers smile as before i hate her crooked teeth
cu summers hair as before i hate her s haircut
cu summers knees as before i hate her knobby knees
cu summers eyes as before i hate her lopsided asymmetrical cock eyed head
cu summers neck as before i hate that centipede shaped scar
cu summers breasts as before i hate her
cu summer asleep as before i hate the way she sleeps
i hate the way she laughs
over black play the middle of every little thing she does is magic
reverse angle on a trolley full of people terrified of this raving lunatic
son youre gonna have to exit the vehicle
tom passes summers desk
a new secretary sits there
he notices in the trash a reprint of an avant garde surrealist painting of two dogs humping
he stops and retrieves it from the bin like its some family heirloom
he gives the secretary a dirty look for tossing it
cu the same painting
angle on summer and tom looking at it curiously
cu a second painting which is nothing but red
angle on summer and tom looking at it with the same expressions
in a way it speaks so much by saying
i feel the same way
cu a third painting which could only be well poop
angle on summer and tom still perplexed but trying
they say nothing until you wanna go to the movies
the marquee reads part vampire
the theater is packed
everyone is laughing and screaming and throwing popcorn
tom and summer are having a great time
summer and tom stand on san franciscos most interesting street corner where the ultra modern transamerica building stands next to the ancient columbus tower
a lot of people have problems with this but to me it makes both structures so much more beautiful side by side like that
summer and tom in front of the famed roman style structure
the guy who made this maybeck he is a god
summer and tom sit on the steps which offers a stunning view of the citys architectural marvels
it just makes you feel
they really do seem at peace
tom and summer in front of the gargantuan mirrored building
see now this is torture
over there thats st
the beauty of st
patricks is its humility
with this giant mirror thing deflecting all the attention away its too humble
no one even knows its there
how would you change it
theres a million things
first theres no need for this much glass
you could easily
dont talk about it
summer gives him a pen from her purse and the underside of her arm
tom thinks about this
then he starts to draw a sketch on her skin
we catch her watching his face as he draws
shes attracted to his enthusiasm
see this beam it steps on the landscape
but if we moved it
tom and summer who have ridden together to work stand outside the building
you wanna no you go first
it doesnt matter to me
whatever you want
a co worker passes
like nothings up hey
summer joins the co worker and walks in
to co worker so hows it going
she turns back to look at tom on the way
she sticks out her tongue to be cute
co worker doesnt see
tom is crazy about her
tom at his cubicle with the one architecture sketch
the phone rings and he picks it up
summer is on her cell phone in the office copy room
she begins to sing the theme song to the a team
mckenzie enters and sees her singing into the phone
turns without a word and leaves
tom listening to her sing
mckenzie comes over
your girl is losing it
tom is too wrapped up in the phone call to acknowledge him
the smile on his face is the biggest weve seen yet
we just see the curtain but we can see their silhouettes behind it
summer and tom are trying to have sex in the shower
theyre trying to stable themselves grip something so as not to fall elbows are flying its a mess
this is not at all as easy as it looks
the curtain rips and the bar comes crashing down
they fall on top of each other laughing
tom and summer wander through the aisles
theres no way
you may as well just say piggies
i told you
i love ringo
cause nobody loves ringo
thats what i love about him
summer drags tom into the curtained off porn section
she picks up a box
this got great reviews
tom and summer get comfortable
both are excited and looking forward to this
the movie starts the credits roll
tom and summer start to make out a bit both keeping an eye on the tom and summer watching the movie
theyve even got popcorn
tom mckenzie and paul are having a drink
so whats going on with you and summer
i dont know
is she your girlfriend
i wouldnt say that
what would you say
like are we going steady
come on guys
its not an unreasonable question
mckenzie do you have a girlfriend
no i do not
in fact girls are repulsed by me
paul how about you
why yes in fact i do
her name is robyn
see tom its easy
it is when youve been with the same girl since high school
youve been seeing this girl what two months now

we know how we feel
we dont need to label it
that stuff is very
youre so gay
well let me ask you this then
do you want her to be your girlfriend
tom takes a second to think about this
i dont know
i heard her hansen
shes not the girlfriend type
youre gonna need to discuss it
itll be fine
have you made her a cd yet
you really need to have that talk
rachel is playing field hockey on the th grade team
tom is watching from behind the players bench
a whistle blows and rachel comes back and sits down
you were saying
my thinking is
why rock the boat
things are going well
if we start putting labels on it thats like the kiss of death
like saying to a girl i love you
i know what you mean
thats what happened with me and sean
who the hells sean
my boyfriend before mark
who the f
i need solid female advice
yeah but you know me
this is the kinda stuff that always gets me in trouble
so basically you do want to ask the question are we boyfriend girlfriend
youre just afraid youll get an answer you dont want and that will shatter your illusions of how good everythings been these past few months
is that about right
something like that
thomas tell me this
is it worse to get the wrong answer now
or find out in a month she has a date coming up with lars from norway
hes a professional surfer with brad pitts face and jesuss abs
that son of a bitch
you see what i mean
the whistle blows again and rachel gets up to go back on the field
coach no wait
i need her
shouting to rachel rachel what do you think i should do
calling back just dont be a pussy
on tom we
tom and summer driving on the golden gate
tom is very conflicted and we can see it in his face
theyre silent a few beats before hi
are you ok
he clenches his teeth
summer ive gotta ask you something
he takes a deep breath
hes about to go on when wait
summer finds on the radio a particular song
waiting in vain by bob marley if you must know
oh my god
we cant talk during this song
its too beautiful
and it is
toms hand is on the gear shift
she puts hers there and locks it with his
tom listens and tom watches summer listening
theres something about this moment the way she sings along the way her eyes close during certain notes the way her smile rises and falls like she could cry at
any minute from being overwhelmingly happy or just simply overwhelmed
tom is powerless to stop his feelings for this girl
marley sings in life i know theres lots of grief but your love is my relief
we know as well as he does he will ask nothing tonight
tom and summer are in a large circle of people at a party
time cuts reveal that summer is talking with laughing with drinking with and possibly flirting with many of them
tom notices smiles pretends it doesnt mean anything but hes clearly jealous not in a sexual way but of the attention theyre getting from her
its been a while
he misses that attention
tom starting to get that unshaven unkempt look wanders through the self help section
he leafs through some of the titles
he grabs just about every one of them
tom has more than fifty self help books on a shelf by his bed
he reads from one called six steps to getting over him
so he broke your heart
youve been sad and depressed for weeks
perhaps youve turned to drinking or even drugs
and nothings helped
should you binge on rocky road and watch soaps all day
tom sits in his bed eating ice cream
he continues to read
no you should not
he slowly puts the ice cream down
through extensive research we have found the six most effective ways to get over that lost love and make room in your heart for a new man to fill
those steps are tom jogs
the bodys release of endorphins will assuage the brain and provide a genuine sense of accomplishment and success
cars pass him at top speed
bicycles breeze by him
a child on a big wheel soars past
he may as well be jogging in place
tom is taking a yoga class
physical and mental relaxation
channel all of your energies to the core of your being for a new understanding of the self and others
this shit is really fucking hard when youre as inflexible as tom
everyone else in the class seems at peace
tom cant even get the breathing right
tom feels good about himself as he gives out food to the homeless
you are not alone in your pain
next in line is a homeless couple holding hands
tom spirits immediately fall
even these two somehow found each other
tom stands in the center of a fashionable ladies shoe store
you know you want to
angle on tom just sorta standing there
he doesnt really want new shoes
tom backpacks alone in the forest
take some time to see another environment
its a beautiful world
it will be for you again someday
this is it hes finally found some peace
tom looks up to the tops of the trees where the sunlight is peeking in and takes a deep breath
information bubbles pop up on the screen to point out that tom is standing in poison oak
theres a rusty bear trap a step ahead of him
a giant poisonous snake creeping up behind him
a tick on his leg
and in the distance a hunter has tom sized up in his rifle sight
tom starts to itch
tom is painting the walls of his now nearly bare apartment
hes focused on his task and in fact seems pretty good at it
by taking these few steps you will have discovered your inner strength and should be ready to move on
i bet you can hardly remember his face at all
we pull back to reveal tom has painted a giant mural of summer on his wall
he looks at the self help book and dropkicks it
summer and tom stand by the bar
i just dont get womens fashion nowadays
everybody with the tattoos the giant hoop earrings those annoying hats
explain this to me
people think it looks good
i like how you dress
what if i started wearing berets and got a huge butterfly tattoo on my leg
a tall well built good looking douchebag guy has suddenly appeared next to them
to summer hey
tom and summer stop talking
hows it going
tom puts his hands in his pockets and watches this exchange go down
not sure what else to do
at this point hes more amused than concerned
you live around here
yeah not too far
ive never seen you here before
youre not too perceptive
tom smiles to himself
this guys a tool
nothing to worry about
so uh let me buy you a drink
no thank you
as she answers summer gives a quick glance over to tom
the guy notices
up to this point he had not connected the two of them together
are you with this guy
tom realizes he has to sort of say something now
to summer come on one drink
what are you drinking
sorry no thank you
tom is pleased
and now hes pissed
hey buddy to the douche dont be rude
im flattered im just not interested
now why dont you go back over there and leave us alone ok
its a free country
summer and tom make eye contact again as if to say now what
after a beat so you and him huh
i cant believe that
is this guy really your boyfriend
and that question hangs in the air
tom panicked decides to cut the silence
all the pent up uncertainty and confusion coupled with the challenge to his manhood in front of the woman he loves all manifests in one single solid almost automatic right
cross to the good looking douchebags face
which connects spot on and sends the douche reeling
both douche and tom wince at the pain douches chin toms fist
theres a beat of calm where tom is actually sorta surprised
and then the douche spins around and starts pummelling tom
having been thrown out summer and tom exit the place
tom is a bloody mess granted but feels pretty great about it
did you see that punch
i dont know where it came from
i havent punched someone since josh greenberg in fifth grade
guess im gonna have to throw out this shirt
summer starts walking ahead and tom notices for the first time shes furious
what is it
i cant believe you
you were so completely uncool in there
youre mad at me
i just got my ass kicked for you
oh that was for me
you were what protecting me
next time tommy dont
i fight my own battles
come on that guy was an asshole
you didnt have to hit him
why didnt you just let me handle it
i dont know
this is why i dont want a serious relationship
what was that
look i like you tom
i like this
what weve been doing
but maybe its gone too
i told you all along what i dont want and its
tom waits for more
it doesnt come
can we talk about this tomorrow
he doesnt know what to do or say or think
neither of them say a word as they go their separate ways
calling to her i just got my ass kicked
only the crowd outside the bar hear this
to onlookers i got one good shot in
tom is in the photocopy room with a bandage on his nose
summer walks in not realizing he would be there
she stops short
nothing else is said
wait are you still mad at me
rolling her eyes tom
holy shit you are
i cant believe you
re copies are you almost done
im all done
he starts to walk out
you know what
sometimes you really dont make any sense
tom walks out
he looks back but she isnt looking
when she looks back at him hes gone
tom about to leave the office
passes summers desk
shes on the phone
he wants to stop and say something but shes busy
he walks on
she never knew he was there
summer packed up to go walks over to toms cubicle but hes already gone
left tom tosses and turns in his sleep
right summer lies awake staring at the ceiling
left tom picks up the phone
is about to dial when he stops himself and hangs up
right summer looks at her phone willing it to ring
tom is awakened by a buzzer
he hits the sleep button but the buzzing isnt coming from his alarm
its his door
he gets up concerned and goes to answer it
say youre sorry
say youre sorry for acting like a jerk
im sorry for acting like a jerk
we dont have to label what were doing
i need i know consistency
i need to know you wont wake up tomorrow and feel a different way
i cant promise you that
anyone who does is a liar
i can only tell you how i feel right now
or i can show you
she comes in and kisses him
he thinks about it for a second
is this enough to assuage his doubts
damn it she wins again
he shuts the door in our faces
tom and summer in the wee hours
have you ever had a real boyfriend
you know what i mean
more than one
tell me about them
oh no way
cause theres nothing to tell
come on im interested
you wanna have the relationship history conversation
you sure about that
i dont know
i can take it
well in high school there was markus
insert still photograph of markus
or at least how he appears in toms mind
arm cocked about to throw the winning touchdown pass
quarterback slash homecoming king
he was a rower
what happened to markus
he works for the republican party
just not for me
well for a short time in college there was kurt
insert still photograph of kurt
as tom envisions him
playing the guitar on stage in motley crue
that didnt really go anywhere
my semester in rome
aka the puma
insert still photograph of the puma
a swarthy italian posing in front of a vespa moped in tight gucci pants his boner clearly trying to escape
yeah cause you know
tom has no idea
and he doesnt want to know
and thats it
the ones that lasted
why didnt they work out
nothing happened really
its what always happens
silent for a few beats
did he want to hear that
tom unshaven un showered walks by himself
he turns a corner and sees summer walking towards him
as she gets closer he sees its not her after all and breathes a sigh of relief
tom watches tv
an advertisement for toothpaste comes on
tom could swear the actress was summer
a trolley going the other direction passes by
every passenger on it is summer
tom is a fucking mess
tom and an attractive girl we havent seen before walk towards an outdoor cafe
her name is allison
its clear right away that tom cant wait for this night to end already
so how long have you known paul and robyn
since grade school
no way really
well im glad you called
they spoke very highly of you
tom and alison eat
hows it going
youve been pretty quiet
im pretty quiet too
its nice sometimes to be comfortable enough that you can just sit and eat and not have to say anything you know
do you want to try some
alison looks at her food
tom realizes hes been difficult starts to feel kinda bad
theres this girl
im not usually like this
i wasnt before
long story short she wrecked me
i dont know if you can tell but it was pretty recent and im still kinda thinking about her
well maybe you should think about
who could cheer you up
i cant get her out of my head you know
i see her everywhere
shes all i think about
and its horrible
cause i totally didnt see it coming
i thought things were fine
so now i keep going through every day in my mind every second really
what went wrong
is it my fault
could i have prevented it somehow
summer and tom stand on the street corner looking at the buildings
a lot of people have problems with this but to me it makes both structures so much more beautiful side by side like that
tom keeps talking
summer turns and looks directly at the
while you continue to talk about buildings and whatever other bullshit interests you ill just nod my head and pretend to listen while secretly dreaming about the many ways i
can one day rip out your heart and eat it like the rabid vampire i am
tom and alison
maybe there were things i could have said or done you know
from the scene in which tom and summer first slept together
hes sleeping like a baby probably the best sleep hes had in a long while
summer lies next to him
bored and unfulfilled
tom and alison
alison is desperately trying to get a drink
christ i dont know maybe she was never that interested in me to begin with
tom and summer ride in silence for a few beats
how was your weekend
winks at him it was good
if im acting strange thats why
im sure its tough getting over an ex girlfriend
actually she was never my girlfriend
now alison is really confused
and its right around the part where tom starts totally cracking up
i thought id have figured it out by now you know
where im going where i want to end up who with
all that stuff
i still dont know anything
and the thing is
when i was with summer none of that mattered
i never even noticed how much of my life was missing
isnt that weird
you were in love thats what it does
but now that you know where the holes are you can start to fill them
hey ive been talking non stop
well i grew up so what do you think
did i do something
did i not do something
what can i do now
alison contd you wanna get out of here
i know this great
suddenly excited oh
you know what we should do
tom is yes on stage singing another song by the clash train in vain
not so much singing as having a nervous breakdown to music
you said youd stand by your man
so tell me something i dont understand
you said you loved me
and thats a fact
and then you left me said you felt trapped
alison sits by herself in a booth trying to hide her face
you didnt stand by me
not at all
you didnt stand by me im talking about you summer
on alison having the worst date ever
tom is getting dressed for a big fancy night out
a punkish pop song plays in the b
that he occasionally boogies down to
he tucks his shirt into his pants
he ties his tie
he brushes his teeth with aplomb
he looks for finds and plucks a grey hair from his head
he makes some faces into the mirror
satisfied he grabs his coat and hits the street
tom walking in the spring air feeling good
the phone rings
summer on the cell as she enters her apartment
she looks like shes coming back from the gym
hey its me
you having a good day
i am thank you
listen about tonight
i think i might just stay in and go to bed early
im just really tired and ive gotta go in early tomorrow
would you be super mad at me if we went out this weekend instead
you dont want to just maybe go to dinner
i mean youve gotta eat right
im not really that hungry
and this place is fancy right
touching his tie sorta
id rather not
seriously do you mind
tom is standing still now no longer moving
hes trying to keep his frustration from being audible
hey no thats cool
whatever you want to do
so well talk tomorrow alright
good night tom
but the line is dead
toms head sinks into his chest
yet another frustrating night
i just got lucky i guess
we met in elementary school
we had the same class schedule in the th grade and we just
shit i dont know
as long as shes cute and shes willing right
actually cute is a strong word
thats a pretty complex question
philosophers poets scientists everybody has a theory dont they
rachel contd i kinda like what nietzsche said there is always some madness in love but there is also
always some reason in madness
think about it
although nietzsche also said kill the jews
so theres that
ive been happily married for years
shes the light that guides me home
yes it is from one of our cards
no someone else wrote it
doesnt make it less true
ok im sick of this love shit
weve been fed this nonsense for generations to the point where its now genetically encoded in our very beings
and what does it mean
give me a break
im just saying
i really need some ass
you got nothing
i wouldnt say the girl of my dreams no
the girl of my dreams would have a better rack
probably different hair could like sports a little more
robyns better than the girl of my dreams
you know why
cause shes real
he says nothing
just stands there
we go right animation
a quick second recap of the earlier color sequence
tom is wandering through the office whistling
hansen dont you have like twenty bar mitzvah cards to write
what are you working on
but ive run out of ways to say it
good job well done way to go
i got nothing
why dont you try
everyday you make me proud
but today you get a card
thats not bad
tom walks by the room marked weddings and anniversaries
hes about to keep going when he pauses
all of the people who work in here are middle aged women
currently they are standing around one desk where tom sits writing everyones cards
this is good millie
to my wife the love of my life
i love you
thats very nice
i was thinking though why not try something like
everyday that we dont meet is meaningless and incomplete
you know spice it up a little
the women clutch their heart like they might faint
workers are again all gathered around tom
did you try
whoa perfect yes
what else you got
tom says something totally in yiddish
no one knows what the hell he just said except for one employee who bursts out in tears of joy
tom passes summer at her desk
he waves back
hes so in love with her
angle on tom writing furiously at a computer terminal
aint no woman got what you got sista girl
happy birthday to the lean sheen and sizzly mocha queen
the african american mahogany writers are impressed
somethings gotten into you son
its pretty cool
tom and summer in line to buy tickets
you really want to see this
it sounds amazing
its like all stabbing and shit
all you take me to are sappy little romances
i want to see some open wounds damn it
i want carnage
suddenly tom sees something at the front of the line
and here they come toms mom and step dad sarah and martin
toms face registers a noticeable panic
sarah and martin are delighted at this coincidence
sarah hugs and kisses her son
looking at summer hi mom
maybe this will be ok
mom martin this is summer
weve heard so much about you
its so good to finally meet you
sarah hugs summer
and now martin weighs in with his own hug
tom notices summers face growing increasingly concerned
why is he hugging me
to tom is this the girlfriend
tom is caught like a deer in headlights
what can he do
well this is the girl friend ive told you about
i dont know if girlfriend is the right word
you going to see the serial killer one
yes we are
should we save you seats
again this has become incredibly awkward for tom and for summer
well see you inside
when theyre out of earshot tom sees that summer is distraught
sorry about that
you wanna go do something else
we can totally bolt
did you tell them i was your girlfriend
i never used that word
they seemed to think
i mean why is your step dad giving me a hug
does he hug all your friends
theres that word again
summer looks at tom like shes disappointed or even angry at him for something
then she walks ahead of him into the theatre
hes forced to follow
answer less as conflicted as ever
why is none of this easy
summer tom sarah martin in a row
summers face is cold emotionless
tom tries to look at her to make eye contact something
she knows hes looking but it doesnt make her head turn his way
tom gives up and watches the movie
angle on the movie screen
we see a black and white film
its a man racing down the street fleeing from an unseen assassin
when he turns around we see the man is tom
bullets fly and hes hit repeatedly in the back while running away like belmondo in breathless
he dies an elaborate violent horrible on screen death
rave music blares
tom stands off to the side looking miserable
summer is on the dance floor
though shes not really dancing with anyone in particular shes dancing with everyone
finally she comes over white shirt dripping with sweat and clearly a little high on one thing or another
youre not having any fun
youre having enough for both of us
i havent danced in ages
i wanna dance with you
where were you an hour ago
i might have danced then
ive been standing here by myself this whole time and you didnt look over once
so youre pissed
im not pissed
you know i hate this shit
then why are you here
this is what you wanted to do so
were doing it
yeah well i didnt need a chaperone
youre a buzzkill standing there pouting
thats real nice
he walks off
she feels some guilt for a second
but when he doesnt turn around she just shakes it off and starts dancing again
tom is outside in the rain
we can still hear the music blaring from the club
summer is in there
tom is alone
he cant believe its come to this
fade up you make my dreams come true by hall and oates
the worst morning ever
tom walks down the street
or more accurately tom sulks down the street
though its sunny and warm tom is a sad broken man and the world is an awful place
theres still hall and oates following tom almost trying to cheer him up
he checks out his reflection in a window
ron howards brother clint looks back
tom walks by a couple making out on a bench
he walks by a sign that says today only free beer
he doesnt even stop
cartoon bird returns but tom swats it away
the worlds most beautiful woman stops to ask him for directions
he doesnt even look up
toms parade of supporters the postman mayor mccheese all of them shake their heads and give him disapproving looks
the cartoon bird takes a cartoon shit on toms shoulder
tom tries to kill the bird
cant even manage that
he passes summer desk on the way in
shes no longer there
he miserably sits down at his desk tries to work but he ends up just staring into space
tom has been called into the principals office
you wanted to see me mr
has something happened to you recently
what do you mean
a death in the family someone taken ill
anything like that
look i dont mean to pry
does this have something to do with summer leaving
faking badly your
the reason im asking
lately your work performance has been
a little off
im not following
for example heres something you wrote last week
reads from a card on his roses are red violets are blue
fuck you whore
most shoppers on valentines day mr
are you firing me
no no no
youre one of our most
well im sorry
things for me have been a little difficult
i understand that
i was just thinking
perhaps you could channel your energy into
he hands him some sympathy cards
funerals and sympathy
misery sadness loss of faith no reasons to live
its perfect for you
now back to work you go
he quickly ushers him out of the office
tom wakes up
he gets his bearings and then quickly rolls onto the floor and begins a brief push up routine
most days of the year are entirely unremarkable
they begin and they end without creating a single lasting memory
most days have no real impact on the course of a life
the phone rings
tom stops his push ups to answer it
may th was a saturday
tom walks in to find paul and mckenzie at a table
they look extremely nervous
whats going on
neither one answers him
they look at each other
we have news
its about her
do i want to hear it
thats what we wanted to ask you
lately youve been
youve been much much better
so maybe its best we dont ever bring her up again
just let sleeping dogs lie
leave those dogs alone tom
you guys look im
i appreciate what youre saying and thank you really for putting up with me these past few months
ive been crazy
but ive accepted the fact that she and i were just two very different people who wanted very different things
i wanted to get serious
shit i loved her
and i know now she just isnt the kind of girl who can settle down with one person and be happy
the way i wanted
and she probably never will
there was nothing i could do
mckenzie and paul just sit there
now more uncomfortable than ever
on tom we tom comes charging out of the place with his friends following behind
theres no fucking way
it cant be
how do you know
on toms pained face we
tom is going apeshit in his room
hes ripping down posters taking pictures out of frames and tearing them apart
he punches the wall
he drinks an entire bottle of red wine
he tries to find something to kick and cant
he throws his cell phone off his balcony
finally he collapses on the bed
the half destroyed alarm clock goes off
tom hits the off button
same exact thing
tom in a robe and boxer shorts buys milk oj cigarettes jack daniels and twinkies
the clerk eyes him suspiciously
tom sees a couple kissing on the sidewalk
he sees another couple entwined on a bench
its killing him
he sees a third couple walking towards him holding hands
jesus christ people
get a room
they look at this lunatic in his robe and quickly walk away
we pan across to see tom is wide awake
he probably hasnt slept in a day or so
he has no reaction to the alarm
tom actually wanders in to work wearing sunglasses and the clothes he slept in
people pass and say hello
he cant muster responses
at his desk tom
ive been calling every five minutes
are you ok
do you need anything
im out of twinkies
well lets go
tom sits next to mckenzie and across from vance
hes in his usual boardroom position which is to say near comatose
a female co worker s stands at the front of the room in mid presentation showing slides that have something to do with a cat in various poses
first we see cat reaching up for out of reach milk bowl
this one says go for it
she clicks to the next slide
cat hanging from tree branch
this one says dont give up
we see cat considering a giant leap
and this one says you can do it
we have a whole line of inspirational cards featuring pickles my cat
i think people will really enjoy them
she takes her seat
good job rhoda i agree
really inspirational stuff
now whos next
we havent heard from sympathy in a while
reacting to his name hmm
the winter collection
you have anything to contribute
i really dont
you have nothing
well i wouldnt say nothing
actually thats about right
well come back to you
mckenzie you know what
can i say something about the cat
this here is and rhoda you know i mean no disrespect
this is total shit
dont give up
you can do it
he points to the screen still showing the cat about to leap image
this isnt inspirational
he tries that jump im writing a sympathy card for that cat
thats the last thing i want to be doing with my life
its bad enough writing these things for people
hansen this is a place of business
we dont cut down our co workers thats cause were liars
its what we do here
why dont we level with people
stop feeding them nonsense
were a greeting card company
yes but think about it
why do people buy these things
not to say how they feel
theres paper and pens for that
people give these cards when they cant say how they feel
or theyre afraid to
and we provide the service that lets em get away with that
tom is getting excited
the rest of the room is growing uncomfortable
i say to hell with it
lets level with america
or at least make them speak for themselves
i mean seriously whats this
picks a card off the im sorry to hear your grandmother has passed
what the hell
lets give em some truth
something like sorry to hear about your grandmother
heres a card so i get some credit in your time of need
im sure it makes up for the fact that grandmas dead
vance and the card writing team are appalled
think about it
picks up another card congratulations on your new baby
congratulations on your new baby
guess thats it for hanging out
nice knowing ya buddy
hansen sit down
picks up a card wait whats this
look at this one with all the hearts
lets open it up
happy valentines day sweetheart
i love you
oh thats nice
if someone gave me this card mr
i would eat it
tom recognizes hes losing his shit
he takes a seat on the boardroom table
its these greeting cards sir these cards these movies these pop songs
theyre responsible for all the lies the heartache everything
everyone shifts in their seats
i think we do a bad thing here
people should be able to say how they feel how they really feel without some strangers putting words in their mouths
a card is a nice thought but it shouldnt do the dirty work for you
you love someone tell them yourself in your own words
maybe its not love at all
maybe theres no such thing as love
yeah i made it up so what
tom gets up and walks to the door
its all crap
we make and peddle crap
and sometimes people believe in this crap
i just cant do it anymore mr
theres enough bullshit in the world without my help
and with that he gets up and walks off
the room is pretty stunned
mckenzie tries to start a clap
it doesnt really take
tom comes outside with some boxes
he stands out in front of the building
his face says one thing
did i just do that
and then we tom and his friends on the sidewalk outside the deli
theres no fucking way
it cant be
how do you know
we broke up last august
and you said she was single at christmas
and now shes
now shes getting married
im so sorry tom
it doesnt make sense
where did they meet
is it someone we know
so everything she said
all that stuff about
it cant be
i know her too well
she wouldnt do that
his friends say nothing
and with that he storms off
let him go
angle on tom walking away from them
literally his entire universe falls apart
fx buildings come crumbling down
the whole city turns to rubble
hes the only constant as the world around him is erased brick by brick beam by beam as if by an unseen force and reduced to nothing
and we fade up those famous opening bars of hava nagila
cu on a circle of people holding hands some young some old tom right in the mix trying hard to smile
has he joined a cult
we are toms sister rachels bat mitzvah
tom and his family have formed a traditional hora
they dance in a big circle and clap their hands
a chair is brought to the center and rachel is lifted high above the circle by tom his step dad and some others
rachel is standing by a cake with a microphone
your apple pies are really great
so uncle sid and aunt ro come light candle number eight
angle on tom sitting with his mom sarah at the table
mom looks at her son knowing something is wrong
tom catches her looking
tom being accosted by two more aunts
i cant believe that
i cant believe it either
what are you
you should be married now
with a family
what are you waiting for
the right girl i guess
theres girls everywhere
i bet you have to beat em off with a stick
oh youd be surprised
actually squeezing his look at this punum

my friend mimi has a granddaughter

angle on tom alone at the table
the band plays lady in red and everyones dancing

angle on rachel dancing with a boy
so this is a big day in your sisters life

rachel arrives in the nick of time
she drags him to the dance floor

who knows someday one might turn out to be your true love
are you making fun of me now
no im serious
i got news for you rach
that true love stuff
its make believe
well thats not very romantic
its the new me
the song ends
go play with your friends
youll be ok
i know you think she was the perfect girl for you
i think youre just remembering the good stuff
but what do i know right
she blows him a kiss and then runs off and joins her girls
tom watches her go
tom is wide awake sitting fully dressed on his bed putting his shoes on
he holds the phone up to his ear
summer is half asleep under the covers
the phone lays at her side and she angles towards it
are you still sleeping
im getting up
what time is it
are we still hanging out today
ill meet you at liberty in
i might need
tom and summer are having a picnic
if it looks familiar its cause we saw them here on page
this is that fateful day tom described to his sister and his friends
the day it all finally fell apart
so how was last night
it was fine
just a work thing
where did you guys go
didnt get home until after though which is way too late for a stupid work function
how was your night
not much more to say
stay with them for a few extra beats of silence
tom and summer shopping at the fruit market
unless we were looking for trouble we wouldnt see any
but since we are we might notice she lags behind him as they walk through the aisles
his hands are in his pockets
but only if were really looking
tom almost with a full beard is redecorating his apartment again
we see him rearranging the furniture in the room
he hangs some new pictures
he uses a pencil on the wall to mark for a bookshelf
then he uses a ruler to make sure his marks are even
he draws a faint line on the wall to mark where he needs to nail something
that day again
as weve seen before tom reads a newspaper
summer reads a novel
its playing at
you want to go
i dont know
you wanna maybe go back to your place or i want to see it
unless you dont want to
no i will
a few more silent beats
somethings in the air
tom and summer watching the film
tears begin to well in summers eyes
they soon turn to audible sobs
tom turns to look at her to offer some sort of comfort believing it to be a response to the movie
she doesnt look back
tom drawing a straight line on his wall
and then he stops
he looks at the line hes drawn
he extends it a little bit
he draws another
he begins to furiously draw on the wall
from out of nowhere inspiration has hit
an image starts to form
a pretty impressive looking futuristic skyscraper almost shaped like a tear drop
same day from the past
they walk out at first everythings alright
its exactly as we saw on page
but soon after that she begins to cry again
serious real sobbing
he goes to hug her
he hugs her
its unclear if she hugs back
hey sum its just a movie
im sorry tom
is everything alright with you
she smiles tries to pull herself together
im being ridiculous
this happens to me every time i watch hoosiers
lets go for a walk ok
lets get some air
or go to sister rays
tom and a much more in control summer walk down the aisles
he grabs one
it pains me that we live in a world where no ones ever heard of spearmint
ive never heard of them
and its painful
he grabs a ringo starr album and shows it to her just as weve seen on page
she smiles and they continue on down the aisles
in cu tom goes to hold summers hand
but something happens
it could be a total coincidence but just as his hand approaches hers in slo mo she moves it away and keeps it at her side
tom puts his hands in his pockets unsure if theres something to read in that
tom sketches intensely
the landscape the skyline the works
hes in the zone
again that fateful day continues
tom and summer outside
i think im gonna call it a day
you wanna maybe
get some dinner or something
ive got pasta at home
are you hungry
im pretty hungry but ooh
ive got a great idea
lets get breakfast
summers resistance is futile
and the rest as they say is history
fade up number two by the pernice brothers
which plays tom shaves
makes himself look presentable
tom now clean shaven and looking like he did when we first met him sketches on his bed with one hand while holding a phone with the other
tom sits on a street corner drawing new additions to the citys skyline
tom sits with his feet up on a table headphones on his ears reading one of many taschen books on innovative building design
tom drops off his portfolio with the security guard in the lobby of a high rise
tom and his mom and step dad cheer on his sister playing soccer
its a nice temporary distraction for him
tom getting bad news on the phone
he has a list written on his wall which is now composed of a dynamic cityscape of futuristic looking structures
he crosses abrams and abrams off the list
we notice several others are also crossed off
tom has his car on the side of the road and is out measuring the distance between the beams of the bridge
a little faster this time
tom getting more bad news from the answering machine crossing off yet another firm from the list
he sits on the bed with his shoulders slumped
for a beat lost in thought
then as if to shut those thoughts out whatever they were he turns on the tv and joylessly watches the nothingness
on the left tom alone on a bus
looking out the window
on the right summer
in her wedding dress
the veil is lifted
and shes a bride
tom in a suit exits a building after another dismal interview
we can see he is frustrated but not deterred
in the distance his favorite spot in the city where he took summer ages ago
tom walks over and sits down on a bench
he stares off lost in thought
and then from out of nowhere theres her voice
summer sits like an apparition on a neighboring bench
she may have just sat down she may have been there for hours
tom isnt sure if shes real
he doesnt quite know what to do
re suit where you coming from
how long have you been sitting there
tom finds it hard to look at her
i come here a lot
i always loved this place ever since you brought me here
the mention of their past makes the atmosphere frosty
i should probably say congratulations
but only if you mean it
i dont know if i do honestly
i hope youre happy
you really do
they both laugh a little
the tension begins to dissipate
how are you tom
yeah i quit the office
what are you doing now
so whos the guy
who my guy
dont tell me
i dont want to know
no really i dont
more awkward silence
this one goes on a beat longer
and its amazing to me
youre not only someones girlfriend your someones wife
pretty crazy huh
ill never understand that
tom whats different now
how could things change so quickly
i dont know
it just happened
thats what i dont get
what tell me
i woke up one day and i knew
tom says nothing
i knew i could promise him id feel the same way every morning
in a way that i
i never could with you
and theres not much else to say after that
tom gets up to leave
you know what sucks
realizing that everything you believe in is complete bullshit
destiny soulmates true love
all that stuff
its nothing more than silly childhood fairy tale nonsense isnt it
tom dont go
i should have listened to you summer
you were right all along
summer takes a beat to let this hang there
i was right
and then out of nowhere she begins to hysterically laugh
this is funny
tries to stop but it only makes it worse
nows shes completely cracking up
what are you laughing at
and she cant stop
shes totally lost control
trying himself not to youre a crazy person
youre the crazy person
what are you talking about
one day im reading a book at the corner deli and this guy sits down and starts asking about it
now hes my husband
this is funny to you
what would have happened if i went to the movies instead
if i went somewhere else for lunch
if i showed up to eat ten minutes later
tom it was meant to be just like you said
and as it was happening i knew it
i could feel it sure as the sun
and i kept thinking to myself holy shit
tom was right
you were right about all of it
it just wasnt me you were right about
tom is speechless
summer takes his hand
we may notice her wedding ring
we may also notice that this is the same exact shot as the first scene of the screenplay
we hold it for a few seconds more
and then the hands separate
anyway i should probably be getting back
it was good to see you
im glad youre well
summer gets up and starts walking away from him
after a summer
she stops and turns back
he takes in her face most likely for the last time ever
i really do hope youre happy
see you later
and she walks away
the camera tracks away with her leaving tom alone in the park getting smaller and farther away every second
tom in a suit with a hefty batch of architecture sketches at his side waits in the foyer of allen prince and gethers architecture
from the room we can tell this firm is big time
we notice before he does a very cute girl sitting in a another chair also waiting
he smiles back
are you here to interview
are you interviewing
for the position
why are you
it would appear
gee this is a little awkward
yes it is
well i hope you dont get it
i hope you dont get it
they both laugh
theres a silence for a few beats
and its during this time that something weird comes over tom and we can visibly see it in his face
he likes the look of this girl
this girl is cute
hed like to talk more with her
and honestly hes a little surprised by it
are you from
grew up not too far from here
atherton near stanford
i know atherton
have i seen you before
i uh dont know
i dont think so
do you go to st
not to pray or anything but to stand outside
i love that church
its like my favorite structure in the city
if only it wasnt near that horrible mirrored thing
i totally agree
i think ive seen you there
i didnt see you
you probably werent looking
a man comes out
come on back
he starts to go
but halfway through the doorway he pauses and looks back at the girl
if tom had learned anything
it was that you cant ascribe great cosmic significance to a simple earthly event
thats all anything ever is
nothing more than coincidence
second clip of the colored sequence
but its there
it took a long time but tom had finally learned
there are no miracles
theres no such thing as fate
nothing is meant to be
he was sure of it now
tom turns back around
to girl excuse me
when this is over
would you like to maybe
grab a cup of coffee or something
im sorta supposed to meet someone
he turns back around and shakes that off tries to refocus on the task at hand
a job interview
and then he hears
tom turns back around
ill wait for you here or you wait for me or
shes cute when she laughs
well figure it out
extends hand to shake my names tom
nice to meet you
she puts out her hand to meet his
and on his face
