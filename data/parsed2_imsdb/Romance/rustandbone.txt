written by jacques audiard thomas bidegain based on craig davidsons short story collection th august gradually more and more visible in the darkness the face of a child sam
he is years old blond pale and miserably thin
as we move in on his eyes we see his lids quickly contracting
under his eyelids vestiges of the days lights and shadows of the days noise
a grim region where the sky hangs low and the wind can knock a man off his feet
on the side of the highway a large muscular man with spiked blond hair ali van versh
he has a big bag in one hand and a cell phone in the other
he talks on the phone as he continues walking its me
i took the kid with me
she cant take care of him anymore
i got into a fight with the guy shes with
i dont know where to go
what do i do with the kid
i cant talk
i dont have any more credit
call me back
he hangs up quickly and turns to sam
his phone rings
he immediately answers
where is it
its so far
how do i get there
i dont know
today or tomorrow
ali lifts sam onto his shoulders with one arm
sam is tiny he looks like a squirrel on his fathers back
there is a map of the french rail system near the toilets in a regional train
while sam pees ali examines it
he follows the lines to plot out their trip
he arrives where france ends at the mediterranean
sam comes out of the bathroom straightening his pants
we dont have any money
a different speed different countryside
ali notices a half empty bottle of evian water left on a tray
he takes it
he searches through the garbage under other empty seats
ali and sam eat leftover sandwiches and fruit and finish off abandoned bottles of water
rain evaporates off the windows
ali has fallen asleep
hes too big for his seat
sam watches the landscape go by and bangs his feet against his seat
ali opens one eye
sams mickey mouse sandals pause then go back to their banging
i said to stop it
the sandals freeze
all of a sudden sam is asleep his eyelids blinking quickly
alis face is turned toward the orange heat of an afternoon sun
ali and sam look at the sea the beaches and hotels
its hot and beautiful
they walk by tanned people in shorts short skirts sandals
in their shapeless grey track pants they look like hoboes
ali drags his sport bag with one hand and sam with the other
ali is on the phone i dont know
a big street that started at the station
yeah by the beach
we just came from there
ali pulls sam away from one of the stairways that lead to the beach
so am i
hes coming to pick us up
sam is extenuated
ali has to heave him up onto a shoulder
a four lane avenue near the outskirts of town
ali is walking on the shoulder of the road with sam piggy back
a horn beeps
a refrigerated truck blinking to get to the side of the road
the window rolls down to reveal a moustache and a cap richard
a couple miles back i saw a blond guy
imitates screeching brakes i stop short
he says no me kurt
another few hundred feet another big blond guy
screech i ask you ali
this time i didnt even understand what he answered
another few hundred feet
ten of them
every kraut and flemish guy on the coast
so i go call your sister
ali is thrown for a loop
uncertain you kidding
to ali is he a little crazy
to sam what
you dont like my truck
yeah i do
pretending to be shocked he doesnt like my truck
i do too like it
worked up sam shrieks holding his hands over his ears screaming i like your truck
the road hugs the seashore
ali watches beaches homes a railway line pass by
voice over we hear richards distant voice
a kitchen with mismatched furnishings
china and cheesy wallpaper
sam devours the cookies and coke that richard gives him
we all got fired after some spanish guy bought out the trucking company
i thought it over discussed it with your sister and figured i could do it on my own
so i bought this truck with my severance pay
ali has finished his cream cheese sandwiches
he gets up and opens the old fridge
oops poor man not those
shell kill you
start with the expired ones on the top shelf
theyre organized by date
first the top shelf then move down
anna brings it home from the supermarket where she works
as soon as they reach their expiration date those idiots throw it all away even if you can still eat it for a week
to sam you want some more
anna empties sams spiderman bag onto the table spilling out old dirty crumpled clothes
with a hint of southern accent is this all you have for him
anna van versh alis sister is in her thirties
she is a huge woman very tall with a pretty face
she wears leggings that make her ass look like a workhorses and a pair of flip flops
at the bottom of the bag anna finds a passport and opens it
it is sams
she remembered his passport
she didnt remember anything
it was already in there
she forgot about it thats all
when they went to amsterdam theyd use the kid to smuggle dope
you got to be kidding
thats what she told me
anna shakes her head in disbelief
how will you tend to the kid
i wont be able to all the time
i work and so does richard
was he in school there
i dont know
you dont know if your kids in school
turns to sam you in school
sam is watching tv
back at your moms place did you go to school
i can try to enroll him at the school
we also need to get him some clothes
he cant go like that
ill ask the neighbors
gives the child her hand come with me to the backyard
i have to feed my babies
evening is falling
at the back of the garden are a home made pen and doghouse
four puppies come running
sam touches them through the chicken wire
you want to pet them
she lifts sam up over the wire mesh
dont step on their tiny paws
theyre just babies
anna shows him how to feed puppies then stands back up
to ali the breeders picking them up next month
brings in some money
otherwise richard and i were thinking a month for you and the kid
is that too much
its not too much but i dont have it
i had to pay for the train
so what are you going to do
i dont know
find a job
you think theres any work around here
you think theres any more here than there
where has that ever been the case
when you told me you were coming down i said we couldnt afford houseguests
what should i have done with the kid
where should i have gone
i have no idea but if you stay here you have to pay your share or else go somewhere else
as far as were concerned its easy we cant
how long were you thinking of staying
i dont know
she makes a tired gesture and goes back toward the house calling richard on the way
ali hears sam in the kennel giggling in delight
he looks around the seedy garden a metal shed leaning to one side whats left of an engine an old orange special moped plastic junk etc
overhead a plane descends on nice its landing lights shining
in the cluttered basement sam is rolled up in a sleeping bag arranged on a pallet and watches his father repair the antique special moped by the light of a
ali wanders through an electronic goods shop pretending to be interested in cameras
through the shop window he can see sam waiting outside in the sun
suddenly sam sees his father run out of the shop trying to shake a security guard hot on his tail
sam watches them disappear into a tiny lane
sam looks around a bit frightened
farther off in a busy shopping districta ali forces his way through hordes of tourists
the security guard grabs him by the hood and forces him up against a wall
they are both dripping with sweat and out of breath
unzip your jacket
empty your pockets
ali keeps his cool
unzip it yourself
ali struggles free and smiles at the guy invitingly
the guard tries to punch him
ali dodges the guard hesitates a moment until ali lets fly a right hook
the guard stumbles
a kick in the face sends him flying into a stall
ali lifts his arms in victory for the benefit of the few stunned passersby
he kisses his own biceps does three steps of a moonwalk and saunters off
sam is walking along the street by the beach amid the terraces and ice cream stores looking for his father
then he sees the moped at the far side of the parking lot where they had left it chained up
he walks toward it
a voice calls out
here i am
ali crosses the street and kneels down in front of sam who is sniffling tears in his eyes
no need to cry
i wouldnt have left you all alone
ali unlocks the moped
in a small side street sam watches ali sell a camera for a few euro notes
on the beach ali and sam eat some mcdonalds
are you happy here
what do you like the most at aunties
is that all
nothing else besides the dogs
the dogs and the truck
the dogs and the truck
sam watches his dads fat fingers assemble the plastic toy from his happy meal
we have it good here
alis fingers stop
sam looks up to find his father watching some girls in swimsuits go by
they go for a swim horsing around and making noise
the logo is in the shape of a sheriffs badge and hangs over some filing cabinets on the wall of a modest office alta securite
no criminal record
you never fucked up
the boss is in his fifties
he sits behind some files
his hair is short and white it looks like hes wearing a helmet
he is squeezed into a cheap suit and wearing a tie
he stares at ali
is that the truth
well be checking anyway
the owner reaches out
ali hands him his tattered paper id
the owner writes down the number
ali is on the picture
what was your last job
i worked in a slaughterhouse
not for long
ever work in security
i was a night watchman in a stadium for months
working for the city
in a parking lot too
i did replacements
ever do any combat sports
karate for years
i even won junior division
and two years of boxing
you gave it up
it was my trainer who gave up
and how are you physically
you stay in shape
you dont smoke
he shakes his head no
the boss notes something in a file
anna and sam are waiting outside the office
the owner kisses anna on the cheek
he asks how richard is doing then shows them to the door
anna looks proud to know him
the door to the fever ray night club
patrons wait bouncers pick and choose
an imposing caucasian maneuvers the red rope
behind him ali van versch and foued latahoui who looks like a lightweight boxer guard the door
ali wears a faded blue alta secu jacket and stiff matching pants
looking well groomed foued is wearing a white shirt and tie
a group of girls passes through the security barrier
foued acts like hes hesitating okay ill let you through because im outnumbered
four against one i dont stand a chance
the girls smile and disappear inside
ali watches them vanish
you say something nice anything
that way when they leave they remember you and you can hit on them
if theyre a little plastered if things didnt go too well for them youre there with a nice thing to say
and it works
but you cant be dressed like that
like a parking lot attendant
they are interrupted by the bouncer
they go running
three guys are fighting like savages
ali and foued clean house
foued gets rid of gawkers
ali delivers a few random punches lifts one of the guys off his feet and grabs another by the collar
while foued chases the rowdy men toward the parking lot ali helps a girl back to her feet
shes a pretty blond must be about or who has taken a punch in the face
it is stephanie
are you okay
breathe out of your mouth
in and out
put your head back
walk a little
walk and breathe
he demonstrates how and takes her by the arm forcing her to walk
she looks groggy
i have to go home
you have friends here
no i came alone
i have my car in the lot
ill be fine
you cant drive like that
im fine i said
you cant drive like that
ill call you a cab
how do i get my car afterwards
seriously ill be fine
we hear a voice from the parking lot
stephanie looks back
you you cunt
she ignores him pretending not to see him
she then notices the blood stains on her t shirt
wheres your car
his head seems to touch the roof of the little fiat and his thighs are too thick for the seat
he glances over at stephanie
keep your head back
he manipulates the knob to push her seat back
he grimaces in pain
did you hurt yourself
he shows her his right wrist
its swelling up
he rests his hand on the wheel
after a beat you often go to the fever
why do you go alone
to find a guy
she turns and looks down her nose at him oh yeah
youre dressed like that just for dancing
how am i dressed
i dont know
he points to her skirt riding up her thighs
yeah so what
you look like a hooker
how would you call it
i dont believe this
pull over here
stop this car on the double
its my car
if i tell you to stop you stop
still no reaction as if she hadnt said a thing
she is about to scream again but remains silent although open mouthed
she finally settles back down on the back of her seat and looks elsewhere
dressed like that its no surprise that
thats enough now
they ride in silence
the fiat stops in front of a small building in a flowery residential neighborhood
they climb out
how will you get back
i dont know
she takes out her wallet
for a taxi
got any ice at your place
he shows her his wrist
wait ill go check
i can come up
even she is surprised by the brusqueness of her response
embarrassed someones up there
ill be right back
she takes a few steps fumbling for her keys
she hesitates then looks back
okay come on up
they enter the apartment
the light is on
simon comes out of the bedroom in his boxer shorts and a t shirt
hes thirty blond and there is something commanding about his look that could be thought to resemble stephanies
he discovers ali and the blood stains on stephanies t what the hell
whats going on
are you okay
yeah im fine
pointing to ali whos he
the bouncer from the fever
he drove me home
what the hell were you doing there
ali opens the refrigerator
what are you looking for
he hurt his hand
simon pulls stephanie into the bedroom
ice cubes in a plexiglas salad bowl
alis hand in the bowl
he looks around
there are photos on the wall stephanie surfing on the back of a killer whale stephanie posing with a group of young people in diving suits in front of the
marineland logo stephanie rising out of the water on niskas rostrum etc
from the nearby bedroom he hears snatches of simons if you decide to go out call me
who were you with there
philippe and christine
i thought you went out to dinner
we decided to go out for a drink after
you get my text messages
why didnt you answer me
stephanie comes back into the kitchen
she has changed her t shirt
she seems tense
is that you in the picture with the orcas
just one orca
her name is niska
is that your job
ali nods vaguely admiringly
i didnt think that
a whore could train whales
well you see
simon is at the door
he is wearing a jean
to ali okay are you done now
can you leave us alone
ali stares him down
you talking to me
its as if alis calm peremptory tone suddenly let simon know who he was dealing with
nothing forget it
in one second stephanie sees simons face undergo a metamorphosis his nervous authority suddenly disappear
she glances at ali as if to say a please go now
he gets up and wipes his hands on a dish rag
okay im going
pointing to a piece of paper on the table i left you my number if ever you need it
she dissolves an aspirin in a toothbrush glass
she checks her lip in the medicine chest mirror
she notices simon watching her from the bathroom doorway
are you okay
are you upset
no im not upset
she drinks the aspirin
i saw your face before
with that guy who dropped me off
i saw your face
i saw how you piped down
i piped down
yes you piped down
pause dont tell me what i should do how i should live my life
dont give me any more orders simon
what does that mean
dont give me any more orders thats all
she turns on the faucet and runs her lips under the water
two rooms adjoining the locker room
two desks and on the walls pictures of the trainers with their orcas laminated posters of various training methods files for each animal
stephanie is in her diving suit sitting in front of louise a year old woman who is reading a document about her internship
a trainer leaves the locker room his backpack slung over his shoulder
he leaves without a word
louise looks up
she has been crying
stephanie looks at her impassive
louise swallows her tears
this isnt fair
no louise there are lots of things you can say but not that
the pools are my responsibility and all i care about are the animals
i have to see to their environment and that starts with their trainers
do you understand
what are you trying to make me believe that i wasnt up to par
lacking in maturity
youre not consistent
weve already discussed that
the foundation of the relationship with the orcas is stability
during your internship youve had your ups and downs
its not your competence that
you know this has nothing to do with my internship
you couldnt care less if i was competent or not
it has to do with that i fucked michael
just say so
and in fact what really bothers you is not that we fucked but that he told me about you
how you think youre so
how youve become such a bitch
thats why youre firing me
thats what you should write in your report
okay are you done
we can stop here
no need to spoil the rest of your internship
louise stands up
the empty stadium above the pool
the trainers walk along the gangplanks busily
in her diving suit stephanie leans over the beach of pool
she taps on the surface of the water
a wave forms whirling around the pool
the whale washes up on the beach beside her
she performs what looks like a daily ritual
she examines the whale caresses it
the whale responds with uncanny gurgles
stock shots of a show at marineland or images which we will film to resemble stock shots wide angle shots from the stadium
the sound equipment blares jump by van halen orcas shoot out of the water the audience applaudsa little kids clutch electric blue dolphin balloons getting splashed by the orcasa images
of the show are relayed on giant video screens orcas shoot by like torpedoes behind the plastic protective wall in front of the main pool etca all at once silence
then surface noise but muted by the cubic meters of watera underwater shots from pool number
overhead the surface shines like a mirror
in pool number a five ton black shadow bides its time it is niska
behind the grate in pool number niska watches her mates diving and surfacing in a spray of bubbles
a mechanical creak then the grate slowly begins to lift
its about to be her turn
niska swims into the big pool slowly at first but then picks up speed
she surfaces disappears for a long beat then again reappears churning up a whirlpool of bubbles
on the other side of the mirror the music blares and the crowd cheers
what looks like a small black and white arrow dives into the pool
we recognize stephanie
she caresses niskas rostrum then kisses it hanging onto her fins waltzing with her up to the surface
her hands look ridiculously tiny on the huge black fins
we see her face mirrored in one of the orcas huge black gentle eyes
a liquid world of greens and blues whirls around them
now with her legs slightly arched on the rostrum stephanie has niska swim around the pool accelerating the water pressure and speed
the plastic wall rushes by a rush of adrenalinea clouds of sediment are lifted as if by a gust of wind
a young male tom joins niska in pool number
niska immediately rushes him as if riled by the intrusion and flattens him against the plastic wall
in the shifting reflections at the waters surface we can make out stephanie and two other trainers faces on the a beach
their palms beat on the water summoning the orcas for their next number
tom gathers some momentum then shoots around niska to jump into first place
he disappears a moment then is back into the water after a dozen meters of aquaplaning
niska then gets into place and takes a running start but just as she is about to shoot out of the water tom appears out of nowhere and forces the
huge female to leap over him
we sense chaos up above
then we see niska crash back into the water with one after the other a piece of the huge video screen that towered over the stage bits of scenery and
all kinds of random objects as if niska had carried away half the platform in her wakea it all seems to fall in slow motion like flecks of snow in a snow globe
something sinks toward usa a body floating weightless and disjointed in a cloud of red
stephanie is on the rim of the pool
all around her the audience panics a loudspeaker orders evacuation louise leans over her
tom and niska
they got in each others way
then louise sees blood spurting from the rips in her diving suit
she tries to find a pressure point
stephanie sees louises face wet with tears stop it calm down
her hand searches for something at thigh level without finding it
ali is wearing his mp headset
he runs down the road to the beach sweat dripping into his eyes
sams toys are lying scattered in the garden his half eaten snack is on the table
ali takes off his headset
there is some noise over at the kennel
he goes and finds sam in the kennel talking to the puppies
what are you doing here
sam jumps and scuttles to the back of the kennel but ali reaches in and grabs him by the arm
sam is covered in mud straw and dog shit
whos taking care of you
ali drags him over to the garage to hose him down
the water is freezing cold
sam hops from one foot to the other and screams
stop it dad
an year old tomboy wearing a skimpy tee shirt comes out of a neighboring house joelle the neighbors daughter
arent you supposed to be taking care of him
what the fuck are you up to
i was next doing the laundry
take a look at him
ill put him in the shower
to sam crying dont go in there
joelle takes sam and disappears inside
ali is drawn to the living room when through the half open door he notices the flat screen turned onto a news channel
onscreen and behind the anchorwoman he recognizes an inset photo of stephanie the same he saw at her place riding on the back of a killer whale
iiiiiisiiiiziiiiiiiisiis il manque une phrase there was an accident at marineland
ali answers without taking his eyes off the screen
i know her
sam pulls off his towel
he watches his father who is riveted to the screen glued to the looping footage of the accident
the silence of an on duty nurses lounge a table a microwave on a mini fridge and louise standing by the window sipping coffee
she is wearing a fleece jacket her hair messily pulled back
she hasnt had any sleep
she hears a scream
she rushes into the corridor
louise rushes into the room
she finds stephanie crawling on the floor dragging her ivs
she hesitates overwhelmed then calls for help
on the linoleum two stumps stick out of stephanies nightshirt two thick bandages surround her thighs that look like two wrapped hams
what did you do with my legs
two nurses arrive
stephanie is back in bed the ivs in her arms
louise rocks her gently
stephanies eyes struggle against sleep
she wants to scream again but doesnt have the strength
she falls asleep in louises arms
she feels eight years old
a series of scenes day and night fade into one another always from the same pov
in the foreground looking our way is stephanies face and behind the visitors who succeed one another
stephanies eyes are shut
she opens them the other trainers from marineland holding bouquets
they are silent and look devastated
they occasionally speak to each other in whispers
stephanie closes her eyes
stephanie opens her eyes louise is seated nearby i stopped by your place
i saw the cleaning woman
she didnt want me to pay her
shes scared to come here
she sends her regards
she closes her eyes
she opens them
a blonde pretty woman in her fifties is sitting behind stephanie her face is close to hers
it is her mother
she speaks with a slight accent
i spoke to your brothers
they wanted to talk to you but i didnt think it was the right time
well all come with hugo during the next school break
i was afraid i might lose you
i dont know what id have done
it may seem selfish
in any case youve always done whatever you wanted
but this time i was so scared that i dont think ill ever be scared again
her eyes close
her eyes reopen
the surgeon and his assistants
the orthopedist and his assistants
her eyes close
her eyes open
simon is there looking stiff and ill at ease
he tries not to make any noise as he puts a bunch of keys on the night stand
he leans over and kisses her hair
her eyes close
its her mother again but this time accompanied by a tall uncomfortable looking blond teenage boy
she leans over to kiss her
in german hugo wanted to say goodbye to you
were leaving tomorrow but well pray for you honey
her eyes remain open
the bluish light at the bottom the main pool at marineland
a diver is raking its bottom wiping away sludge composed of micro algae paint chips and fish bones
he examines the replacement mud and then inside the drain the mud being replaced
he digs his hand into the sediment and feels something there
he surfaces and deposits his find on the rim of the pool it is one of stephanies diving flippers with her foot cut off at the ankle
stephanie wakes up with a start in her handicapped bathtub
she tries to grab the bars but cant find them
she rolls over on herself like a floating log
there are several rows of parallel bars with amputees hanging on to them as they relearn to walk with their prosthetics
most of them are old
nurses help them along
from her wheelchair stephanie watches looking glum and as if at a great distance
her hair is greasy and her face swollen by her medication and induced sleep
she looks through the big window that opens onto the exterior
outside amputees smoke and chat
she notices one group livelier than the rest
at its center a guy is smoking a cigarette he holds in a pincer in the place of his hand
his name is gilles
four of them are smoking a joint in gilles megane
outside evening is falling over the convalescent centers parking lot
stephanie is sitting up front
she passes the joint to gilles who takes it in his chrome pincer
she notices the scar that deforms his face and one side of his mouth
there is a couple in the backseat making out raphael his arms are missing and his sleeves are pinned up at his shoulders and julia
to stephanie want me to tell you something
you havent finished mourning thats all
mourning my legs
he sounds as serious as a civics teacher
she looks at him incredulous
raphael sticks his head up front
pass me the joint
gilles pincer and joint go for raphaels lips
he takes a long hit
they were a part of you
when a man dies he gets buried
theres a ceremony a prayer
now a piece of you ended up in a hospital trashcan without a prayer without any time for meditation
she is dumbstruck
she cannot believe what shes hearing
in the backseat raphael exhales some smoke into julias open mouth
gilles contd you have to think about it symbolically
yeah its really symbolic
i know where my arm is
we buried it under a nice oak tree behind my house in the scrubland
my wife and kids came and we sang
stephanie has a fit of the giggles
a bit vexed you think im kidding
no its the grass
she laughs so hard she cries
shit its a laugh riot up there
to gilles can you take us home
she looks back and between the seats notices the girl toying with raphaels fly
im too beat
ill take a nap then go
to stephanie how are you getting home
a hyperbrico diy store in an industrial zone in cannes
its windows shine in the night like an aquarium
ali and kadhi a huge guard accompanied by a dog make their rounds
they open doors with a magnetic key each time recording their passage on electronic terminals
a bit before midnight someone knocks at the main entrance
ali goes to look
its a guy in a leather jacket and baseball cap with a backpack and a shoulder bag
what do you want
to come in
the guy takes out a card and presses it against the glass door its the business card of alta secu the security agency
hey kadhi come here
kadhi comes over and looks at the guy
are you martial
give me your keys
the boss told me he was coming
he works for the company
ali hands him the bunch of keys
ali goes down an aisle looking for something and finally finds what he was looking for a folding ladder
martial has spread out his material in a stock room at the back of the store at the end of a corridor formed by palettes precision tools drills electronic mini
cameras still in their wrapping cases equipped with antennae packs of batteries
a small radio is playing a night program on radio monte carlo
equipped with a small headlamp martial carefully cuts a hole in a cardboard box with his leatherman scissors
he conceals a tiny camera inside
ali arrives with the ladder over his shoulder
will this do
put it down there
martial climbs the ladder to place the box high on a shelf
imagine youre the manager of a big store like this and the union reps have been busting your balls
what do you do
you think thats how it works
what do you do before you fire them
he checks to make sure the lens is aligned with the hole then checks the screen and reception on a small pocket monitor
well beforehand you try to see how long they spend in the restroom if they take extra long coffee breaks smoke on the premises steal from the stockroom rip customers
off with the sales receipts
when you know all that you put the pressure on them and you fire the ones who dont leave
can you give me a stroll down the aisle
walk down the aisle
no further down like you came out of that door there
ali twice passes within the cameras field of vision
martial climbs down his ladder
okay then ill be getting back
martial pulls a euro bill from a jacket pocket
angle on the bill in alis hand
ali is in the security room reading a kickboxing magazine
a small radio is playing a late evening program
outside in the parking lot kadhi smokes while walking his dog
the dog takes its time
ali watches kadhi pull on the leash
alis cell phone rings
the screen reads a unknown
we met at the fever
ali is taken by surprise
how are you doing
her speech sounds slow and thick
you know what happened to me
i saw the papersa the news on tva how are you
sniggering how do you think i am
ali is at a loss to answer

every day and every night
i dont know how to manage
the speciale putt putts in the early morning light
ali drives through a neighborhood of chain stores conforama courtepaille leroy merlin
a gated community made up of four story buildings lawns bougainvillea and lavender
it looks pretty as a picture and squeaky clean
the door opens automatically
he is surprised
he hears a tired voice from inside
she is waiting in her wheelchair holding the remote control
she activates it and the door closes behind ali
her hair is mid length her face has thickened and there are bags under her eyes
she is wearing a baggy nike t shirt with burn marks here and there and a pajama bottom whose legs hang limp
have you been waiting long
i just got here
was that you who rang before
she looks exhausted but feverish
he sits down on a small couch
want something to drink
i only have instant
it takes two tries to activate the wheels on her wheelchair
need any help
she answers with a growl as much for him as for her wheelchair then goes into the kitchen
he sees her pajama legs flap like rags he hears the noise of the tap
have you been living here long
i dont know
three or four months
she comes back
are you alone
you got no one to help you
help me what
no for the cleaning and everything
yeah there are people
they come and go
she manages to navigate from the living room into her bedroom
he stays in the living room
he hears a kettle whistle in the kitchen
he goes into the kitchen and pours water into the glass mug
he finds her hunched over in her wheelchair
she is nodding off high on her medication
hey are you okay
he opens the window
does it stink here
yeah a little
he opens the curtains and looks outside
it is getting hot out
the automatic sprinklers have gone on
lets go out
no answer hey you hear me
lets go out
leave me alone
where are your clothes
he opens the closet
when they come out of the buildings lobby the sun hits him on the head like a bad hangover
ali hands her a pair of sunglasses
where should we go
i dont know
youre the one who wanted to go out
should we go to the ocean
i dont care
he tries to push the wheelchair but she stops him stop it
i want to puke
he notices that his moped is attached in the middle of a sprinkler area
he goes to free it and gets splashed
heavy chain padlock
he comes back with soiled hands
when he comes back shes gone
he sees the wheelchair moving toward the seafront avenue
he goes to join her
they are sitting at a table on a terrace facing the beach
they remain silent
she looks at his huge fists black with axle grease
i want to go in
i feel like swimming
you dont want to
you dont feel like swimming
she looks daggers at him
you dont have a bathing suit
do you realize what youre saying
who the fuck cares
theres no one here
he wavers a moment then finally crosses the seafront avenue
stephanie is at the top of the steps in her wheelchair
ali is talking with the beach boy when he notices her
ali and the beach boy carry her to the deck chair area
ali rents the whole shebang parasol beach towel deck chair and a small tube of sunscreen
sheltered under a parasol she pancakes her face with cream and watches him dive in wearing his boxers and noisily and clumsily crawl some laps
his body is pink and white
huge and buff
then she looks out to sea the listless waves washing in and out
the fresh feel of it all makes her want to drink it all in
he comes back enthusiastic and dripping wet
she looks around
the beach is deserted other than for a far off elderly couple broiling in the sun
actually i think i will go in
he looks at her
she covers herself with a towel and wiggles out of her pants revealing what remains of her legs
her stumps are white with terrible scars at their extremities
you have to carry me
makes a gesture
how like this
he lifts her up and carries her to the water
he takes her far enough in until she begins to float
dont let me go
not right away
do it gently
she feels unsure of herself
he lets go of her gradually
she starts to sink then crawls forward with power and grace
she stops but has to paddle like a dog to tread water
he joins her
she grabs onto him
i cant stop
if i do i sink
this is bothering me
she takes off her t shirt and hands it to him
her breasts press against alis chest
okay you can let go
she lets herself go and crawls like a pro
he stays put holding her t shirt
twenty five meters later her head emerges
he hears a burst of laughter
half asleep in a deck chair he looks up from time to time to see how shes doing
she calls out to him
she is sitting in the water
she motions for him to come and get her
he helps her out and takes her into his arms
she hangs on to him still out of breath
you swim like a real pro
she shuts her eyes
fuck thats good
the beach is crowded now
ali carries her back to the deck chairs
some bathers watch them go by others look away
they are stretched out in their chairs
she has wrapped her lower body in a beach towel
she rolls onto her back
he sees her breasts pointed heavenward
a decrepit simple functional but reasonably clean workout room
guys of every color work the punching bags lift weights do chin ups
from the gym next door we hear the booming music of an aerobics class
in a small ring at floor level ali and foued loaded down with protective gear pound each other
each of their blows lands right on target
they repeat the same series of moves several times at varying speeds
ali and foued are dripping wet
they have towels around their necks
they fill their small plastic bottles at a faucet in the workout room
through a large window in the corridor ali watches the aerobic class going on in the gym legs and feet moving in rhythm red faces sweaty underarms butts boobs and
the braid of the instructor who uses it to beat the measure as she swings it from one shoulder to the other
i have to get back
i need to train
ali nods without actually looking at him
outside ali has unwrapped the sandwich his sister had prepared for him
a bit farther off the aerobics instructor is smoking in the sun
she has a short buff body
she smokes her cigarette like someone who counts them out sparingly
they remain like that a while he chewing ands she smoking
a cell phone vibrates
through a narrow transom a ray of sun slices through the dark equipment room
they havent bothered undressing
ali and the aerobics instructor are making love on a pile of workout mats
alis cell phone continues to vibrate goes silent vibrates again
we hear a crackling voice
im still at the gym
i said im leaving
he hangs up
sam is playing alone perched up on monkey bars in the schoolyard
through a wide window he sees his father racing down a corridor that runs alongside the schoolyard
the principal is waiting for him at the door
ali spurts out some quick apologies
sam slowly slides off the structure
we hear the noise of his hands skidding on metal
the moped wheezes and sputters
ali and sam are heading back home along the beach
ali is so big the moped looks like a kids bike
behind him on the luggage rack he can feel sam leaning into him
sams hand rummages in his coat pocket for a box of choco bn cookies
ali takes one too
to their left a train noisily speeds by
louise has a set of keys
she enters stephanies apartment with the mail
made up and well groomed she looks older than she actually is
stephanie answers from the bathroom
im in here
louise puts the mail on the living room table and enters the bedroom
stephanie wheels herself out of the bathroom her hair wet and her body wrapped in a towel
shit youre not ready
the appointment is in a half hour
what do you mean
youre a freaking pain
i have to get back to work
come on let me help you
she grabs the arms of the wheelchair and pushes stephanie toward the closet
let go of me
stop i can manage alone
okay so manage then
she lets go of the wheelchair and leaves the bedroom
louise briskly pushes stephanies wheelchair across the residence garden
the warning lights on her are blinking in front of the gate
stephanie hangs onto louises neck
louise lifts her out of her wheelchair as best she can and into the passenger seat
louise bends down to buckle stephanies seat belt
annoyed i can do the seat belt
in front of the open trunk louise struggles to fold the wheelchair
cant you call them to tell them were going to be late
in cu the brochures of prosthetic manufacturersa we see pictures of the various models go by
stephanie is in the doctors office with doctor vitias
he is in his fifties and is wearing a white jacket
well order two pairs of prosthetic devices one for everyday life and one for the sport you do
stephanie pages through the various brochures
dont you have something simpler classier
what do you mean by classier
i dont know
like a wooden leg with a piece of rubber at the end
smiling no sorry
we dont make those models anymore
louise shuts her eyes visibly exasperated
or just a plank
a plank with wheels and straps
and irons to move forward with
furious can you cut it out
if i want
ive had enough of your schtick you hear me
stephanie shuts up
vitias still looks patient as job
sitting on an examination table stephanie waits for the resin bands wrapped around her stumps to dry
louise is sitting on a stool across from stephanie
their eyes meet
go if you wanta ill take a taxi
i told them i was with you
and that works
if you tell them youre with me do they let you do what you want
if ever you want a day off just tell me
ill write you a note
louise looks at her
shes not going to let her get on her nerves
there is a knock at the door
a nurse enters
she checks the resin bands looks at her watch
more minutes just to make sure
then doctor vitias will come for you
she smiles and closes the door
the two young women are again left alone
stephanie stretches out her hand
louise takes it
and they remain like that
in close up on the screen of a small dvd player amateur images of two bare chested guys fighting in the garden of a suburban house
it looks like a wild boxing match free for all vale tudo in which anything goes
in the bricorama security room ali kadhi and martial excited are bent over the screen
a few blows to the face have one of the combatants ko on the lawn
look at the next one
watch how he whacks him
a change of scene on the small screen a courtyard between two tower blocks with new combatants but with the same amateur images and the same violence
pointing to the screen
i know him
i fought him twice in nationals
hes not bad
he was at the boxing club in marseille
martial watches ali fascinated by the images as if he were sizing him up
an apartment in a golfe juan housing project
after dinner time
kids are playing women doing the dishes
on the living room couch under a tapestry of a lion hunt in technicolor martial blows on his glass of tea
his cousin is sitting across from him
ali is on a stool at the end of the table
he says hes done thai boxing
he can fight
hes not afraid of taking punches and hes white
the cousin turns to ali
he takes his time sizing him up
is that true
you like to fight
okay so i organize the fights
i pick the fighters
i see if the moneys there
i collect the dough
i take a third of the bets
the rest goes to the winner
a third of how much
we dont fight for less than
ali does the division in his head
to martial theres something i dont get how much do you take
i dont know
you tell me
how much do you need
ill take of what you win
and how much does your cousin give you
oh i introduced you to him didnt i
the cousin stands up
they all shake on it
ali is in a corner of the living room sitting in front of annas old pc and watching some fight videos hes found
anna rushes into the room
keep sam with you for minutes
she hurries to find some papers in the drawer of a commode
ali hasnt budged
i dont want your son in the garden
yeah i heard
he gets up and goes to get sam who is playing behind the house
anna finds her papers and leaves in another direction
i want to show you some stuff
he lifts sam up with one arm and goes back to the computer
look how they fight
he clicks on an image and the fight continues
the audiences noise as well
sam watches intrigued
ali commentates pointing to guys onscreen
look at him in red
see how strong he is
is he the good guy
no hes the bad guy
look how he tries to grab his legs
his phone vibrates
he takes it from his pocket
why is the red one the bad guy
i dont know
look and tell me who wins
he turns down the sound settles sam on the stool and gets up to go speak
into the phone so
what did he say
sam watches the fight in silence
dogs bark in the garden
sam feels something coming
he looks out the window then goes running
ali hasnt noticed a thing and continues his phone conversation
what is this bullshit
what do you mean a tournament
martial is leaning on the bar of a noisy arab cafe betting office talking into his phone
last one standing gets the money
i know but he says its better that way
do you think youre in a position to negotiate a percentage
where did you get that idea from
he gave me a website if you want to see the others
he takes out a small spiral notebook
from the living room ali hears sam screaming in the garden
tell him to give the website to his mother
all i see is me doing more fights and him making more dough
ali goes to the window
outside near the kennel sam has lunged at a guy in a jumpsuit who is helping anna get the puppies into a metal cage
sam is screaming
anna tries to take him into her arms
sam clutches the bars of the cage
the puppies bark
anna finally manages to rip sam free and drag him back into the house
into the phone hes changing the rules and so am i
i couldnt care less
anna storms into the living room
sam is shrieking having a tantrum
he kicks and bites
im on the phone
what the hell
i asked you to watch him for minutes
into the phone ill call you back
ali hangs up
outside the kennel keeper rolls the cage across the garden
anna hugs sam in her arms
to sam hes taking them to the country
theyll be so happy there
leave me alone
theyre my babies
sam refuses to calm down
anna looks at her brother
what are you doing
are you his father or not
youre such a pain in the ass
dont talk to me like that
ali rips the child from his sisters grip
stop it now
i said stop
calm the fuck down
let go of me
sam kicks out
ali shakes him
cut it out dammit
youre such a pain
he flings the child away
sams head hits the coffee table
anna rushes over and picks up sam who has stopped crying
hes been knocked out
anna is frightened
she examines his scalp she strokes his head
a cut on his head begins to bleed
she kisses the wound
ali comes over upset
dont touch him
dont touch him i said
you know what
youre a bad person
huddled against annas breasts sam opens his eyes
the day is over
the beach boy has already packed away most of his paraphernalia
in the water ali and stephanie are out with some of the last swimmers
faithful to what by now seems to have become a habit he carries her piggyback to their lounge chairs
they come out of the water in the middle of a discussion
what kind of boxing
do you use your feet
no just fists i think
we bash each others faces and whoevers still standing at the end wins
hey youre strangling me
he puts her down on her chair
is it the first time youre doing this
and youre not scared
how much do they pay you for this
i dont know
youre doing that for euros
youre going to get whacked on the face and risk your health for euros
risk my health
what are you talking about
why are you getting so worked up
ill give you the
cancel it and ill give it to you tomorrow
you can give it to me if you have too much money but i said i was doing it and i am
if its not for money why then
i didnt say its not for the money
why are you doing it
oh stop driving me crazy
im doing it to fight
why did you clown around on your fish
for the fun of it right
yeah and look how i ended up
you turn on the waterworks when you feel like it
she dries her eyes
he begins to pack things up
your fight if you do it
you think i can come along
a narrow road
down below a town
the mercedes vito with the tinted windows lifts a cloud of dust
stephanie is in the back seat and has to hold on to the overhead strap to avoid hurting herself
at the end of the road is a gate guarded by two huge homies
they signal martial to over
he rolls down his window and the two homies peer inside
they see ali and stephanie in the back
surprised stephanie looks at ali watching for his reaction
he looks elsewhere
the gate opens
martial drives in
ali and stephanie are alone in the car
through the tinted windows they can see a concrete yard with boats dry docked around it and buildings with satellite dishes studding every balcony
some men are over in one corner discussing martial his cousin and some other mean looking guys
in the shade a bit to one side and surrounded by his fans is a bare chested muscle bound north african
he warms up wagging his head from left to right
under his breath motherfuckers acting like hes on canal plus
who are the other guys
i dont know
guys with money
martial comes back with a wad of banknotes and slides into the passenger seat
fall against the big one in black shorts
i told you
theyre big guys
and the bets
how much is there
a little over for the time being
but itll go up during the final match
what do i do
stay in the car
to ali you ready
the blazing sun is melting the asphalt
a coin bounces between pairs of basketball shoes
the cousin picks it up
he points to ali and the guy in the black shorts
you and you
ali pulls off his t shirt staring down his adversary
martial takes the t shirt and leans over to ali
if you get into trouble dont insist just fall
ali doesnt flinch
the cousin the bettors and the other fighters move away
stephanie watches the faces leaning over the balconies overhead
she hears the spectators hostility and cheers
a circle has formed around the fighters
she sees the shadow and only the shadow of his opponents fist barely miss alis face
then things speed up
ali uses his feet knees and fists
when his opponent begins to totter to one side ali hangs onto him like a pit bull
when he falls ali pounds on his face with his fists and elbows
the a ref has to enlist cousins help to pull ali away
ali returns to his place in the car
stephanie looks at him he cant sit still
i have to go
another combat begins while ali jogs around the hangar
stephanie watches other combats whether featuring ali or not
she sees feet dancing on the concrete
she sees the banknotes in peoples hands
she sees heads leaning over balconies
she sees an opponents fist hit ali behind the ear
she sees another of alis opponents get back to his feet and alis fist split open his nose like a ripe fig
she sees another opponents head bounce off the concrete
she sees a tooth roll across the concrete like dice in a crap game
she sees ali perform three steps of a moonwalk and kiss his own biceps
a cloud of dust a narrow bumpy road
martials car is headed for the town below
cu on a long cut behind alis ear
stephanies fingers use a kleenex instead of cotton
bare chested with a towel around his neck ali leans forward to make his wound more easily accessible
its nothing just a cut
to martial got anything to disinfect it with
to ali keep this on it
its the only one i have
ali looks up at her
you liked it
he again lowers his head
put this on it
its the only one i have
ali straightens up covers himself with the towel and remains like that invisible out of breath clearing his throat and spitting out the window
stephanie observes the welts on his body
a big service station appears a bit farther down the road
ali sits back up
pull over here
ill go rinse off my face
puts out his hand give me
martial uses his turn signal
behind the wheel of his stopped car martial counts the bills spread out on his lap
have you known him for long
no not very
alone in the back seat stephanie looks out at the service station
what do you want to know
if i knew him before the accident
martial looks back
you find it weird that were together
you wonder what hes doing with me
no since you know him i just wanted to know if youve seen him like that before
martial finishes counting the bills
he freaks me out
he takes his share and hands stephanie the envelope
she looks at the envelope without taking it
why are you giving me that
its for ali
so why give it to me
he looks at her suddenly surprised
hey you make it complicated
either you take it or you dont
and either i talk or i keep my mouth shut
he tosses the envelope at her
she looks away
ali finally gets back into the car with a big box
its a toy a green john deere tractor with all the accessories
for my kid
you have a kid
the afternoon sun has the entire coast sparkling
ali is on his moped with the box between his knees driving up the coastal road
he looks splendid wearing new clothes
he finally sees what he was looking for a group on the beach anna richard and their neighbors having a picnic
cu ali and anna are off to one side talking
you see what youre like with him
youre not around and when you are you scream at him
damn you hit him
why did you take him along if you act like that
you should have left him
cut the shit
hes not dead
i didnt do it on purpose
im sorry about it
anna avoids his glance
he rummages in his pocket pulls out the envelope of money and hands it to her
what i owe you plus the next few months
you can count it
she looks at the bills
where did you get this
pointing to his new clothes same place
i won a fight
what kind of fight
is that the only job you could find
is that why you have marks on your face
hey will you take the money or not
why are you looking at me that way
he leaves her with the envelope and trots over to the rest of the group
they are packing away ice chests and folding things up
sam and his little friends are playing in the sand with the john deere tractor
sam has a bandage on his forehead
ali sits down in the sand next to him
pointing to the tractor you like it
sam continues to play ignoring him
behind them richard is folding up parasols with the help of che a bearded neighbor who is also there with all his family
have you eaten
yeah yeah im fine
you dont want to drink something before i pack up
ali shakes his head a no
he looks at joelle ches daughter a tomboy with boobs
to sam you want to go for a swim
ali and joalle take turns tossing sam into the waves
the child laughs so hard he swallows water
ali takes sam into his arms
give me a kiss
i dont want to
give daddy a kiss
using a deep voice give daddy a kiss
deep voice too
ali kisses him and hugs him tight
a nearby house
evening is falling
ali and joalle make love in her bedroom
his cell phone rings
the screen reads stef
he doesnt answer
joalle comes noisily
ali puts his hand over her mouth
through the window we see sam in annas garden playing with his new tractor
richard is hanging towels and swim suits on the line to dry
sitting on the couch in a t shirt and boxers stephanie finishes her dinner watching tv distractedly
balancing on her stumps she puts her plate in the dishwasher
then supporting herself on her hands she leaves the kitchen wiggling her way into the bedroom
she lifts herself into bed as best she can
evening falls over the bougainvilleas
stephanie watches old people coming home in their wheelchairs or hanging on to their zimmer frames
ali walks up a long standard hotel corridor lined with numbered doors
he stops and knocks at room
he knocks again
finally room opens behind him
martial looks out
they told me
martial motions him in
this one is for the equipment
boxes of equipment are piled up under the window and the small table has been converted into a work surface
a camera is plugged into the tv set
it shows a still picture an empty location one sector of an industrial site filmed from above
i have to watch this
have a seat
you wanted to see me
ali sits on the edge of the bed
martial watches the screen out of the corner of his eye
i need to find a coach
a real one
someone who has me work on my takedowns
foued doesnt know jackshit
just jiu jitsu and rap stuff
you need to ask cousin
his guys must train somewhere
and ill need some time to train
ill talk with alta secu
well be able to work something out
work it out how
ill have my company pay you and ill bill them what you cost me
theyll keep paying you but now youll work directly for me
you wont have to spend your nights there
there is some movement on the screen
he interrupts himself
gray silhouettes cross the screen open a door and disappear before coming back to cross the screen once again
at the mousquetaires
martial rewinds and zooms in on some faces
ill make a copy and youll take it to the owner
ask for steve at security
hell tell you what to do
sam is on richards lap a driving the truck
he is in seventh heaven
in front of them a man is running down the shoulder of the road
look who it is
go on honk
the horn beeps
out of breath in a sweat ali looks back and sees richard and sam in the truck
they slow down and pull up to him
richard lowers his window
were going to school
want to come along
ali shakes his head and continues jogging
the truck disappears
this new gym is large clean and light
in one corner there is a genuine ring and on the other side a piece of tatami
ali is working out with joao a brazilian in a kimono
they try out some foot fist series
on the mat ali shadows and deconstructs joaos gestures
a street near the beach
the weekend is beginning
the streets are crowded
ali is on the phone
where are you
i cant see you
he looks every which way until he sees her a few feet away
she is standing upright in a light pair of pants with her canes hidden behind her back
it takes some time to register
she smiles at him
thats fucking amazing
i was looking for a wheelchair
no more wheelchairs
you could have told me
is it a problem
no i dont know
youre like before
well not exactly
go on lets see
she takes a few steps forward leaning on her canes
he whistles in admiration
i need to get my balance but supposedly that doesnt take long
it must be like walking on stilts
i dont know
ive never walked on stilts before
you look taller
does it hurt
a little but it feels good too
want to go for a swim
pff i dont know
its different today
i dont think i want to get undressed
they are at the kitchen table eating salad
stephanie is in her wheelchair
ali has finished his plate
is this all you have
look in the fridge
there must be some cheese left
you dont have any pate
no i dont have any pate
he gets up and opens the fridge
he takes the cheese sniffs it then takes some yoghurt too
he notices a box of cereal on a shelf and takes it
he returns to the fridge for some milk
she watches her mouth open in suspense
youre a good eater arent you
he begins with the cheese
she shakes her head no and points to a box of biscuits on the shelf
there are crackers up there
do you have a girlfriend
he shakes his head
you dont have anyone
yes but theyre not girlfriends
what are they
he looks at her
you mind talking about this
no i dont care
pause how about you
did you have a lot of boyfriends
i was with simon
no there were others
but not a lot either
i wasnt very
in fact i liked it when guys looked at me
i liked to feel that i turned them on
afterwards i dont know
they bored me
ali looks at her strangely attentive as if he didnt understand or didnt believe her
i dont even know what it looks like anymore
i dont even know if it still works
you dont want to
did i say i didnt want to anymore
of course i still want to
how do you go about it
how do you think i go about it
if i were a guy id say i jerk off to a porn video
im a girl
ali is dumbstruck
okay lets change the subject
she begins piling up plates and silverware
you want to fuck
she is thrown for a loop
you want to know if it still works so lets fuck and that way youll know
he looks at her simply naturally
she has a nervous laugh
just like that
give me that
he takes the plates gets up and puts them in the dishwasher
i dont know if i can like that
whatever you want
you tell me
she wheels herself away from the table and into the bedroom
he remains alone quickly cleaning the table
what do i do
then come here
he enters the room
the shutters are closed
she is in bed under the covers
she watches him sit down on the bed undo his pants and turn toward her
unsure of herself she pulls a face
he slips under the covers spontaneously tries to kiss her but she pushes him away gently
a little nervous do you mind if we dont kiss
he licks her breasts then lies on top of her covering her
she tries to wriggle herself free
youre crushing me
maybe you should stop talking now
okay ill stop
his hands caress her they grab onto what remains of her thighs
he enters her
she is about to scream but lets herself go
she grabs hold of him
ali opens the fridge
he is dressed again
stephanie appears in a robe sitting in her wheelchair
we can tell she feels too shy to look at him
are you okay
how was it
is it still working
i dont really know
its hard to tell after just one try
yeah but i dont have time right now
i have to go
blushing no no
thats not what i meant
i just meant that its too soon to tell
like too many things are happening at once
ali doesnt understand
but did you enjoy it or not
when youre up for it and you cant find anyone ask me
if im oper well do it
if im available
if i can i mean
if youre oper we
she sketches a vague gesture
her throat is constricted she is unable to answer
stephanie uses one of her canes to push open the door to the staff room
the room is apparently empty
louise are you here
is anyone here
she looks over the office she once knew so well and that hasnt seen again since her accident the photos on the wall the diagrams the case histories the animals
up in the bleachers stephanie looks over all the pools the big one as well as the others
suddenly in na a huge but limp black dorsal fin appears
weighed down by her prostheses stephanie has to lie down on the rim of pool na to reach the water
she reaches out and slaps the water with the palm of her hand
nothing really happens a black mass just keeps circling at the bottom of the pool
she slaps again and the black mass swims faster and faster
a wave is formed around the sides of the pool a wave that swells higher and higher
stephanies hand again slaps the water and suddenly niska emerges
niska washes up
stephanie caresses her and weeps softly like someone caught unawares
stephanie looks back to discover louise and three other ex colleagues
they have been there a moment surprised unsettled and ill at ease
i stopped by the office but there wasnt anyone
stephanie stands up with the help of her canes
the guys rush over to help her
they hug and kiss
all four remain like that for a moment
sun and music
the public is beginning to invade the lanes and paths
stephanie louise and the other keepers are on the terrace of the employees cafeteria
they are thrilled and reassured to see her again
at times a hand touches her arm or shoulder
sometimes an acquaintance comes over and kisses her
under the table stephanie types a oper
into her cell phone then looks up and returns to her surroundings
we can imagine the how are you
the let me get a look at you
you look wonderful
all a bit strained but friendly
louise who is sitting next to her leans over to her softly see
it wasnt hard
they smile at each other and return to the conversation in progress
stephanies cell phone vibrates on the table
she discreetly checks the answer and when she looks up exchanges a glance with louise
from that glance we cut to stephanie and louise are out shopping
stephanie holds herself up thanks to the shopping cart she is pushing
we join their conversation already in progress
when i feel like it i send him a text message and ask if hes oper
if he is we hook up
if hes up for it
if hes free
if he is we fuck
is that all
yes thats all
what else do you want
i dont know
is that enough
for me it is
what does he do
stephanie hesitates a moment as if worried about how louise will react
illicit fights in the projects
whatever i say you make a face
just give me a second to react
are you in love
he does me good
the group of trainers has accompanied stephanie to a taxi
stephanie waves good bye
they return her wave
the taxi drives away
the group scatters
a dark cellar
we hear ali and stephanie labor and sigh
a door suddenly opens above and we hear voices
who is it
he looks for his clothes
then goes to the garden where he startles anna i didnt know you were here
you scared me
what were you up to
i was talking
youre not alone
im with a friend
you bring girls back to my place now
shes a friend i said
just then the basement door opens and stephanie appears on her crutches
anna is dismayed
ali motions to stephanie to stephanie let me introduce you to my sister
to anna this is stephanie
you know the girl from marineland
stephanie offers her hand to anna who takes it then realizing what shes doing puts the other to her mouth oh my god
sam arrives with his snack
stephanie looks at him
so thats him
they are sitting around the garden table
anna comes carrying a tray
they were out of grapefruit
i took tropical fruit
she puts some glasses and two tetra packs of fruit juice on the table
through a hole in the oilcloth stephanie can watch sam playing under the table
ill make tea
i have some cookies
you drink tea dont you
this is perfect i swear
before stephanie can even finish anna is already on the way back to the kitchen
you dont want to get going
wait your sister
you freak her out
cant you see
she feels like a cashier with you
pathetic with her tea and cookies
its a pain
stephanie leans on a cane to stand up
what are you doing
im going to help her
no need to overdo it
later sam guides stephanie up the narrow stairs of the house
she has a hard time with her a legs and canes
a childs room with cheap wall paper depicting dolphins
stephanie is sitting on the edge of the bed
so this is where you sleep
its a nice room
sam nods in agreement
he gives her a strange look
why are you looking at me like that
does it scare you
you want to see them is that it
she lifts one of her pant legs to show the prosthesis underneath
sam looks attentively stretches out his hand touches it carefully
does it hurt
stephanie smiles at him
want to touch it
sam reaches out his hand
in cu through the tinted windows of martials mercedes vito the face of a boxer who is lying on the ground and being pummeled
ali is sitting bare chested in the back seat a towel around his neck and a bottle of water between his knees
ali watches the fight
sitting next to him stephanie fills a plastic bag with ice cubes
she hands it to him
he applies it to his eyebrow
she displaces a bloody strand of hair and replaces it with another
we see martial return to the car and open the front door
he puts a wad of money in the glove compartment
ali nods a yes
he opens his door gets half out and empties the bottle of water over his head
stephanie is left alone in the car
she hears the spectators cheers
she closes the window and turns on the air conditioning full blast
his opponents guard is up closed tighter than a safe
behind his fists ali can see the guys frozen stare
and then suddenly he breaks loose a series of feints and a kick behind the ear
he hears himself growl the light becomes electrifying
he is on the ground protecting himself as best he can
he tries to block his opponents arm
he hears himself wheezing and panting like a pair of bellows
he sees his blood splatter his opponent
all of a sudden in your mouth its like it tasted like bone
a taste of rust and bone
because you think bone has a taste
yeah there i did
then through the spectators legs he sees something sunlight reflected off the mercedes door that has just opened on a pair of shoes attached to two prostheses a pair of
shortsa he also sees the heads of the tough guys who turn back to look
he breaks free struggles to his feet spits up a clot of blood and returns to the task at hand
his opponent tries to get up
ali jumps on him to finish the car is driving back into town
martial is driving
the windows are open
ali holds a bag of ice against his cheek bone while stephanie applies her band aids to a cut over his eyebrows
they are talking but we can not hear what they say
all we hear is the noise of the wind against the open windows
ali suddenly breaks out laughing
martial does too in the rear view mirror
stephanie follows suita muzak
ali and martial follow the head of security into the store
some of the personnel are near the cash registers silent hostile and immobile
the morning customers wonder whats happening
the head of security elbows his way through
let them through please
the personnel reluctantly make way
red graffiti on the wall a spying boss is a criminal ali recognizes the place with the palettes up to the ceiling
in the back he also recognizes the manager protected by two guards and being harangued by union representatives
to ali pointing to the manager go get the equipment
i need to see him
were the ones who will call the police
the police and the press
that way theyll know you spy on your workers
the manager looks away accompanied by his two guards
at least have the courage to look at me when i talk to you
the cameras the ripped out cables the phony boxes have been piled up on the floor
it looks more like the crime squad has been at work
ali opens a garbage bag and bends over to retrieve the equipment
what are you doing there
shes a young employee in the store uniform
suspicious packing up
is it your stuff
he notices that shes taken out her cell phone to take a picture
dont you take a picture
you work for them
she continues to manipulate her phone
i said no picture
why shouldnt i
you film us
he straightens up menacingly
im going to slap you
a hand grabs his arm
lets get out of here
and the equipment
forget about it
were fucked here
the cops are going to question the managers and the managers will turn us in
martials fingers slowly play with the hair on his chest
he is lying nude on the bed of his formule hotel room
he smokes and stares at the ceiling
his suitcases and bags are packed all he has to do is close them
he hears knocks next door
he gets up with a sigh pulls on his pants and opens the door
stephanie is waiting in front of room
stephanie looks back surprised
martial motions her in
i have to go away for work
or months i dont know yet
since ali wants to keep fighting i thought maybe you tend to that while im not here
she is thunderstruck
is he okay with that
hes the one who asked me to call you
i guess he trusts you
laughs thrown for a loop yes sure but
i dont know anything about that scene
i dont know those guys
he hands her an old spiral notebook
i wrote it all down here
as for the rest ask me your questions and ill answer them
how do i do the bets
you can count on your fingers cant you
honestly can you see me dealing with those beasts
and you need money to cover the bets and you have money
she looks at him
youre not rich
what did the insurance company give you for your legs
those jobs must have good health plans
am i wrong
a shadow crosses stephanies mind
she looks at the open bags and suitcases without really seeing them
the place looks like its expecting a police raid
where are you going
grenoble then vienne
no in the isa re
was the insurance money your idea
he gives her time to wrap her head around that one
then since she still looks troubled he taps her on the hand
its me i said
im the bad guy
through the door of the club we hear snatches of the introduction to thunderstruck
people are sweating and trying to get into the fever
foued lets martial ali stephanie and khadi through
virile bear hugs and handshakes
the cousins waiting for you inside
table to the left of the bar
ali knows and greets everyone
stephanie is in the middle of the group
she holds herself up on the shoulders of these big caring guys and lets herself be carried along
she feels good the club is hot as a steam bath
loud music blares out of loudspeakers
bodies dance and eyes shine bright
at the table left of the bar cousin and three friends who are with him
another round of bear hugs and handshakes
martial stephanie and cousin regroup face to face
martial speaks cousin listens and at times looks over at stephanie who looks at him too
she notices one of the tattoos on his arm a green and red snake that seems to be slithering out his sleeve
the barman brings two bottles of champagne
ali leans toward her want to boogie
she doesnt understand
loud you want to dance
she looks frightened but then smiles when she sees what hes up to
whatever you say
he goes to the dance floor and begins to rock
he dances badly clumsily
martial pours champagne
the smoking area is located outside and a bit farther off the dope smoking area
behind the smokers we hear noise from the club
cousin is puffing on a spliff
stephanie watches holding her champagne goblet
he offers it to her
she accepts and takes a drag
can i talk to you
she nods yes
theres something id like to know
the fish that ate your legs
she wasnt expecting that
is it true its still there
where else would it be
they didnt shoot it
or put it down whatever
why would they do that
i dont know
when a dog attacks you they kill it
and the fish gets off
dont you mind that the thing that ate your legs is living it up in its shitty fucking aquarium
and i dont want anything to happen to it
now more than ever
he looks at her incredulous but with admiration
imitating her now more than ever
listen to you
he takes another drag
imitating her tututu tu tutu
do i sound like that
we are back inside
ali is working on a girl a bit farther off on the dance floor
stephanie follows cousin through the noise and sticky heat
when she next looks at the dance floor ali is no longer there
ali and the girl are on their way to the exit
ali looks for a friendly face meets stephanies glance and motions that hes leaving
she waves yeah ok i get it
ali disappears with the girl
stephanie is at the bar drinking
she types an sms into her cell phone operational
she hesitates then puts away her cell phone
she hadnt noticed a guy sitting next to her
she also failed to notice that hes been speaking to her for a while now
i cant hear you
loud no problem
what are you drinking
the guy orders
he is blond lean and athletic looking
he might be thought to resemble simon
whats your name
come here often
stephanie is on automatic pilot
when she turns to the room she feels the blond guys eyes locked onto her
she can pretty much tell what hes thinking about the breasts under her t shirt
she answers his questions she returns his smiles
when she finishes her glass and puts it down on the counter he kisses her
she doesnt push him away immediately like a frightened virgin she takes the time to put a good face on it
i dont feel like it
the guy looks disappointed then manages a a good losers smile
okay no problem
its best i go
good night and thanks
he sees her lean over to retrieve her canes and then hobble away
i couldnt know
you couldnt know what
you couldnt know what asshole
foued runs to warn martial khadi and cousin that something is wrong
when martial arrives he sees stephanie collared by a bouncer three times her size
she lashes out with one of her canes while under the bar another bouncer tries to help the blond guy back to his feet
theres a deep gash on his skull
cousin comes to give the bouncer a hand
the shrill screech of the sea gulls and the milky light of a day that looks like its going to be sunless
stephanie drinks her coffee at the only table on the terrace
behind her chairs are still piled up and the waiter is slowly getting to work
a silhouette appears on the sidewalk
its ali in the same clothes as last night
he joins her and takes a seat
did you stay late
i cant remember
afterwards the cousin took us to a club at la colle sur loup
it sucked and it was a
to the waiter a large coffee with milk and bread with butter
you think its good that were having this conversation
that i ask how it was with the girl last night and you answer normal
what do you want me to say
he grimaces at her mood
oh la what
you think its normal leaving with that bimbo in front of me
what would you say if i did the same thing
you wouldnt care
youre pissing me off
whats your problem
wait let me put it differently
what i am for you
sort of a buddy like foued and the others
tell me something do you and your buddies fuck every now and then
thats the difference
her looks at her
dammit stop looking at me that way
how am i looking at you
the waiter arrives with alis order
she tones her voice down a notch
you wanted us to continue
isnt that what you told martial
what are you talking about fucking or fighting
well we have to go about it well
we have to show each other manners and consideration
stop acting like an idiot
do the words bother you
you know what i mean
youve never stopped being tactful with me
he looks away
is that a plan
she waits for his mind to come back before continuing
but not like animals
he smirks with a flick of the chin
cat got your tongue
ali stirs his cup without answering
he feels her eyes on him
im oper now
you made me oper
its because its all youre talking about
softly you are really a dog
he stands up
what are you doing
im getting out of here
im fed up
what im saying bores you
are you acting like a jackass on purpose
arent you being an ass by putting words everywhere
he sits back down
she watches him eat his sandwiches
im the one whos leaving
she gets up
ali finishes his coffee
the buzz of a small electric compressor
in extreme close up the needle of a tattoo machine pricking skin
ink flows a cotton swab wipes
a tattoo slowly appears
lying on a table stephanie is having what remains of her legs tattooed
stephanie is at a tellers window withdrawing a rather large amount of cash
a machine counts out the bills while the employee stuffs wads of them into an envelope
pennants flap in the wind the pennants of a used car dealership
cu car doors opening automatic gearboxes stephanies feet testing pedals bucket seats backseats tinted windows opening and closing etc
a painting of a lion hunt and under it stephanie and cousin on a couch talking shop
leaning over a computer and a cell phone they go over potential adversaries
some kids stick their heads in to see what stephanie looks like
foued wearing protective gear spars with a black cruiserweight
the fight is close the sound of flesh on flesh resounds
outside the ring ali cheers foued on
he notices on the other side of the ring a young thin bearded guy in a lacoste polo shirt buttoned up to his neck leonardini who is following the fight
with the eye of a pro
when ali and joao are later working out on their bit of tatami ali sees foued sitting on a bench with a towel around his neck and talking with leonardini
he saw me at la ciotat
we spoke a few times on the phone
when he has it in for you he never lets up
leonardini is well known
he was a club in strasbourg with a training center
hes taking me on a trial basis for three months
if it works out hell make challenger in the nationals
ali and foued are off to one side in the locker room
so are you going to strasbourg
what do you think
id be an idiot
and when are you leaving
leonardini enters the locker room
leonardini this is my buddy ali
ali van versh
leonardini shakes his hand
pleased to meet you
through the tinted windshield of a nissan pathfinder suv ali watches stephanie wearing a tight t shirt and leaning on her cane talking with cousin and some bettors
the discussion looks intense
stephanie returns to the car
below her pedal pushers her prostheses sparkle in the sunlight
we hear salacious jibes from the surrounding buildings
she opens the car door
how much is there
are you ready
walking with a slow deliberate sway aware of the effect shes having she ceremonially opens the passenger door
the remarks cease
cu a black and red arrow with in industrial characters its the tattoo on stephanies right thigh
alis hand grips and squeezes the thigh
they are making love
the room is half lit
ali growls and grinds his teeth in his sleep
stephanie slowly and noiselessly rolls over to her side of the bed
she gets up and using her hands drags herself toward the bathroom
suddenly feeling like hes suffocating ali awakens
it takes a few seconds for him to realize where he is
his hand sweeps across the bed
where are you
he sits up
she is embarrassed
no dont look
what are you doing
im going to pee
is it early
shit i collapsed
ali slips out of bed naked yawning and groggy
he comes and leans over her
i dont like it when you see me like this
she hangs onto his neck
he lifts her up and both naked he carries her into the bathroom
stephanie is sitting on the toilet while ali pees in the shower
i called the numbers they gave me at the gym
i spoke to an organizer ga nther bower
theres a gala in turin next week
he told me that wed have time to meet there
im going to go
and when do i see him
later in his gym in dortmund
he wants to organize a test match to see what youre worth
to see if youve got the gattlicher zorn
ali comes out of the shower
turn on the water
turn on the water when you pee
he runs some water
he carries her back into the bedroom
she looks at his face the scar on his forehead the scar over his nose
hows your nose
it doesnt seem broken
they look at each other
he puts her down on the bed and lies down next to her
stephanie slides over to him
he lifts her up and places her on her stomach
they remain like that without moving
she looks like a mermaid lolling on a rock
she leans over and kisses him on the mouth
he pulls away surprised
now were allowed
they make love
in cu the tattoo on stephanies left thigh
a red and black arrow with in industrial characters left
the road speeds by
road signs with the names of italian cities
the landscape has changed
wearing her baseball cap and sunglasses stephanie drives with her elbow out the window
on the radio we hear the voice of an italian dj
ali jogs along the sea shore
he sweats huffing and puffing
he stops takes a few steps then continues but soon stops again
it looks as if his feet are weighing him down
traffic speeds by
he stands still and stares into the near distance
a standard hotel lobby
curious stephanie looks at the crowd of fighters the day before the a ultimate tournament muscle bound giants squeezed into tight jackets with bashed in eyebrows collapsed nostrils cauliflower ears
every language can be heard some greet each other some hug they all size each other up
propped up on her cane she heads for a table in a corner of the bar where a man is consulting his cell phone
in german mr
in german yes
in german im stephanie granget
ga nther looks about fifty and has obviously spent many of those years in the ring
settled in a corner in front of their open pcs stephanie and ga nther talk shop
they are about to separate

pointing to her legs what happened to your legs
in another life

i acted like an arrogant business man
im so ashamed

of course you can come tonight
as my guest
bleachers have been set up in a gym surrounding a cage like fenced in ring
inside combatants fight no rules no holds barred
on the floor two wrestlers clasp and elbow each other
one is bleeding from the forehead
below the ring stephanie is mesmerized by this carnival of violence
ga nther leans toward her in german funny huh
in german what
stephanie walks down a corridor
she stops in front of a door and knocks
ga nther opens
he looks surprised
he is barefoot in a pair of trousers and an unbuttoned shirt
he looks at her inquisitively and when she still doesnt ganther in german are you okay

stephanie in german i

he knits his brow
ganther in german got what wrong
stephanie in german you dont understand

ganther in german no you didnt get it wrong
he smiles and opens the door
ganther in german i have someone in my life you know

he draws her inside
the door closes
anna is about to open her cash register when a west indian in a security uniform whispers into her ear apparently asking her to follow him
another cashier is already waiting to take her place
anna joins three other employees waiting in a corridor
they exchange a few words under their breath
anna comes out of an office looking distraught
she has to lean against the wall to hold herself up
a colleague comes to help
i got fired
theres something we want to show you
in the locker room we recognize the girl who had photographed ali while he was trying to reclaim martials camera equipment
the girl says something to anna
when it seems that anna can not believe her ears the girl takes out her cell phone and confronts her with the evidence
anna needs to sit down
out of breath ali pushes open the gate and climbs the stairs
in the kitchen anna and richard are sitting at the table in front of a meal they havent had the appetite to start
you dont seem it
he goes to open the fridge
what are you doing
dont eat here
ali stares at her stunned
dont eat here
what the hell is going on
i was fired this morning
but whats the problem if i eat here
anna stands up
they had cameras in the storeroom
they filmed us when we took the expired food
they fired us
alis head spins
you had your sister fired
how does it feel
how much did you get for that
you get paid per person or a flat rate
nothing to say
i take you in i take care of your son and you have nothing to say
i couldnt know
you couldnt know
you couldnt know what
that you were screwing us out of jobs
that you were hurting people
ali tries to find something to say but his sisters hand delivers a resounding slap
he takes it like a man
a moment passes
ali is red from the slap red with shamea until he suddenly straightens up and knocks over the table
calm down i said
ali looks back
he sees richards grim face at the other end of a hunting rifle
take your stuff and get out of here
we dont want to see you around here anymore
a sudden noise draws their attention sam is watching from the top of the stairs
go to your room
go upstairs immediately
an sms arrives from stephanie aalmost there
i miss you
a ali is lying on his mattress
he puts down the phone
he hears anna and richards voices upstairs
he sits up and begins to stuff things into a bag
a new message arrives aim home
a ali hesitates then turns off his phone and clicks his bag closed
night has fallen
sams nose is stuck to his bedroom window
he sees his aunt sitting at the plastic table in the garden downstairs with her face in her hands
a door slams
sam rushes to the bathroom window
he sees his father stomp down the street never once looking back
sam remains glued to the window pane
alis silhouette moves through the halo of a streetlight before again disappearing into the dark
sam watches him for as far as he can
fade to black
in the half light of the basement a rectangle of light has formed where the door opens onto the street
stephanie looks over alis mess his magazines body building equipment dirty t shirts track suits hanging over a trestle
anna is standing against the light at the door and a bit farther off sam is sitting on the stairs watching them
in his message he said he was in strasbourg
no news since
i dont know what hes doing there or even if hes still there
has he called you
she shakes her head no
did you try the gym
they dont know
if i had an address or a number id give it to you
even if i think its dumb
do you believe me
after what he did to me
sam sees stephanie join anna near the door
shes about to leave
he abandoned his kid
he doesnt give a fuck about anything
all he ever cared about was himself
hes totally selfish
sam watches the two women swallowed up by the light
you dont know him
what did you expect with him
i dont know
fade to black
a frosty landscape with trees that look like theyve been engraved in ink
a group of twelve joggers in blue track suits run across a landscape of gray sky and snow
some shadowbox while running
ali is wearing a wool cap pulled down around his ears
he runs alongside foued
a ring has been set up in the middle of the gym
a few guys have gathered round to watch ali rhythmically pound on his trainers bear like paws
leonardini sets the pace
youre stepping back
ali pounds harder and harder
he times his respiration to match the movement of his fists
young athletes some tall some short some heavyset some not are sitting on refectory chairs to watch tv
ali does too
his hair is cut short and his face is closely shaven
he looks younger
he could be a student
a truck rushes headlong through the countryside
first it is day then night
through the window ali sees a twelve ton scania pull to a stop at the entrance to the parking lot and beep its horn
ali runs out to meet it
richard lowers his window
i cant come in any further or i wont be able to get back out
ali checks out the huge semi
looks like you changed trucks
bosses in fact
im back to being exploited
ali doesnt insist
richard opens his door to let out sam who is already trampling him trying to get out
to sam got everything
your bag your coat your hat your mittens
you havent forgotten anything
now give me a kiss
sam gives him a kiss
richard slips him out and into alis arms
how are things there
she found a job at a school cafeteria
she seems to enjoy it
does she know about today
she says its good for the kid
tell her i cant help out for the time being but that as soon as i have a little money
whens your fight
on the th
richard smiles admiringly
keep us posted if you win
sure i will
okay im off
ill deliver my load in colmar and pick up the kid at around okay
no later because i have to be back tomorrow at
the two men say good bye
sam waves good bye
a path runs through fields and into a clump of fir trees
ali pulls a plastic sled with sam on top
whenever there is a slope he lets sam glide down it and runs after him
snow falls from the trees
he looks up and sees a couple of squirrels jump from branch to branch
sam has never seen any before
sunlight filters through the branches
a group of cross country skiers trudges by
i want to skate too
theyre not skating
no theyre skating
theyre skiing i said
a few steps on skiing
youre annoying me
they take a break at a picnic area where they eat some sandwiches and drink orange soda
his mouth full does auntie still have dogs
no now its chickens
in the garden
yeah in the cage
they lay eggs
but auntie doesnt want me to take the chicks in my room
pointing to his sandwich finished
you want some applesauce
on the way back they find a frozen pond
ali carefully advances on the ice
he tests it
jumps on it
then he lets himself go and glides across the ice
you can go
but not too far
sam starts slipping and sliding
he falls down
he lies on the sled and lets it glide
ali pees behind a tree
sam is far away
come on we have to head back
showing his fingers minutes
and then suddenly instead of gliding the child sinks
he tries to climb out and sinks again
a thin layer of ice is forming over him
ali rushes to the pond but sam is already iced over
he kneels down and then crawls on his stomach toward the hole
sam has disappeared
ali shoves aside snow
he looks everywhere but sees nothing
and then he hears a noise blows like signals coming from under the ice
ali crawls over and clears away snow as best he can
under the ice he sees sams face staring wide eyed
ali begins to pound both his fists on the ice like pistons or pestles
as if pounding on his punching bag
underwater we hear the sound of dull thuds
sam sees his fathers fists pound on the ice
he sees bloodstains
the ice cracks a bloody fist searches the water for him
sam closes his eyes
evening is falling
ali has stretched sam out on the rim of the pond
the child has turned blue
he tries mouth to mouth resuscitation he massages his heart and rubs him down
alis respiration has become a grunt then a groan
he has stowed sam behind the front of his parka and runs as fast as he can
he slips gets back up and runs again
he again breathes into sams mouth
while still running
leaning against the window of the intensive care unit ali sees sams nude tiny body being worked on by doctors
his skin is blue from the cold
there is a tube in his mouth
his ribs rise and fall to the rhythm of a respirator
his mouth spits out brackish water brutally
a door opens and a nurse appears
ali straightens up
well take care of you
come with me
he doesnt understand
then he notices the blood prints his hands have left on the icu window
he looks at his scarred fingers his broken bloodied hands
sam is lying in a hospital bed
his eyes are closed and coils of tubes attach him to control apparatus
ali is at his side
his hands are now wrapped in thick bandages
the disinfectant makes him look like he is wearing yellow gloves halfway up his arms
richard is standing behind him near the window
ali takes sams fingers places them in the palm of his bandaged hand and looks at them
sams eyes begin to dart wildly under his eyelids
his fingers quiver
his eyes open
there are not many people in the corridor at this late hour
richard is bent over a coffee machine
a cup slowly fills up
farther off ali is ko leaning against a wall
richard brings him a coffee
ali takes it clumsily into his damaged hands
richards cell phone rings
he moves away to answer and speaks into it softly
a few moments later he returns to ali and hands him the phone
she wants to talk to you
richard shakes his head
pause do you mind
how is he
he woke up an hour ago
is he injured
no i dont think so
and how are you
i fucked up my hands on the ice
is it serious
how are you
what are you up to
you mean in general
in my life
i wanted to say that
im not asking for anything
ill be going
ill call you back to see how sams doing
give him a kiss him from me
dont hang up
dont hang up
i wont hang up
he was in a coma for hours
for three hours he was dead
i was scared to lose him
his eyes well with tears
dont leave me
i wont leave you
i love you
a child sleeps
his eyes are darting under his eyelids vestiges of light and shadow of noise
sam opens his eyes he is in a hotel room
at the foot of the bed a tv with the sound turned down low is broadcasting a cartoon of mice fighting in polish
stephanie comes and goes picking up things littering the floor and packing their bags
over these images we hear alis voice the human hand contains bones
some monkeys have more gorillas have five in each thumb
for humans its
if you break an arm or a leg after a while calcium gathers around the bone and joins it together
in the end its stronger than before
but if you break a bone in your hand you know itll never fully heal
youll think about it before every fight
youll pay attention
and even if you pay attention the pain will come back
like needles like broken glass
ali is wearing a t shirt
he still bears the marks of yesterdays fight
his eyebrows and hands are bandaged
wake up kiddo
were going home
did you win
he smiles and kisses his biceps
the lobby of a holiday inn the day after an ultimate tournament
much the same ambience as in turin the fighters winners and losers are about to leave
they greet each other pose for photographers answer interviewers sign autographs
alis hands are still bandaged
he is being interviewed along with a kind of viking with a closed eye and broken arm
ali goes to join stephanie and sam outside the hotel where a taxi driver is loading their luggage
a young polish fan calls out ali
he wants a photo
ali lifts sam into his arms and pulls stephanie closer
