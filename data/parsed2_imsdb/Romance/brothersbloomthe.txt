written by rian johnson dawn with her rose red fingers rises over a dusty country road
a car chugs over the horizon
as far as con man stories go i think ive heard them all
of grifters ropers faro fixers tales drawn long and tall
but if one bears a bookmark in the confidence mans tome twould be that of penelope and of the brothers bloom
the car deposits two shabby boys in front of a country house
both in black
each with a suitcase
at ten and thirteen bloom and stephen the younger and the old the two brothers and an oafish foster father sit eating breakfast
had been through several foster families
the foster father slaps bloom upside the head
stephen launches across the table tackling the dad and beating the crap out of him
narrator contd thirty eight all told
bloom stamped on it
it opens and dozens of reports flip by
under the reason for return of minors field we catch different entries behavior inappropriate unmanageable mischief moved them on in life and moving kept them close
the brothers on the porch suitcases in hand
for bloom had stephen stephen bloom and both had more than most
the front door opens and a pair of foster parents eye the brothers suspiciously
a wide dusty main street which the two brothers survey
another home another main street
stephen looked around then summed the burgh up thusly bloom weve hit a one hat town
one car wash
which through some mishap had one leg
the cat sits on a roller skate rowing itself down the street with its one leg
look at that
a group of children flee the school joyfully
one school which meant one tight knit group of local well off kids
the children run out of the candy store all slurping rocket pops
their pocket change bought rocket pops the brothers at the counter
bloom watches the children go while stephen counts out pennies
the brothers stephen slaps the change down angrily and points with a scowl
the children play resplendent with their rocket pops
they were the they
all well loved rooted happy as you please
bloom and stephen sit off to the side of the park none too happy nursing their pixie stix
narrator contd always there
in every town
stephen glares flicks the stix away like a cigarette
the playground bourgeoisies
he storms off
bloom lingers staring silently at the children
the brothers amble down a wooded path
bloom stops staring into the trees
through the dense thicket of foliage
the children playing
and one gleaming eye framed perfectly through a small open patch in the leaves
bloom pushes the leaves aside
standing in the distance on a wide lawn
stephen places his hand on blooms back
bloom stumbles from the trees very much as if hes been shoved and regains his footing and freezes not shielded at all now from the playing kids and the girl
could he simply talk to her
just drop his fears and go
leave his brother in the woods and join the children
the girl makes eye contact twisting a daisy chain between her tiny fingers
blooms adam apple convulses
he turns tail and runs back into the woods
narrator contd no
brothers in bed
bloom gazes window ward
stephen gazes bloom wise shuffling a pack of cards
you shuffle when youre thinking something through
so whatcha thinking
not a thing
this wasnt really true
cause in the root of stephens psyche something now began
a seed of grand epiphany
stephen spreads out a hand drawn flowchart on a stump and talks bloom through it
a fiction made for profit in which both boys played a part
a simple con in fifteen steps
and this is where we start
stephen runs his finger backwards down the connected boxes each neatly numbered stopping at
bloom talks to girl children and the gold haired girl playing
the wall of foliage where the forest begins shimmers
and then as if a curtain had been pulled back from the sky
some barrier within the younger bloom was broken
bloom bursts through the trees and strides across the wide lawn confident glowing stopping face to golden face with the girl
so bloom performed his role in stephens story to a t
box on the flowchart bloom wins the kids trust bloom does indeed sitting and laughing with a circle of kids suddenly a natural born charmer
and being who he wasnt could be as he wished to be
the golden girl smiles at him
from the shadows of an adjacent alley stephen watches pleased
he slinks away
box stephen finds a cave dissolves to stephen scouting out a cave deep in the woods
in the park bloom runs with the kids laughing
box stephen buys supplies dissolves to stephen in a hardware store pointing
a flashlight snow boots and several large coolers are purchased
back in the park bloom says goodnight to the kids and walks homeward in the warm twilight
box stephen scouts church dissolves to stephens eyes poke up from behind a pew in a church
he manages to look devious as he snags a sunday school schedule
bloom enters hears running water from the bathroom
he glimpses down at the flowchart on the bed scanning down to box bloom comes home to find stephen filling the coolers stephen backs out of the bathroom trolling a
hows it going on the playground front
so on to step eleven then
you tell them wait
blooms lip quivers obviously conflicted
must the numbers rattle on
must the fiction end
i think i need more time to win their bloom
theyre not your friends
theyre part of this and this aint real
remember its a con
and when its done weve just got us
and well be moving on
beat so the tale
you tell them theres a bloom holds court with the kids
hermit in the woods
a one eyed steel toothed vagabond
back to bloom and stephen in the attic with blood red eyes
nods thats good
he stopped you coming home from school
and told me of a cave
what kind of cave
a cave of wonders
shut up dave
at noon on every sunday there appears a ball of light which flutters like a butterfly
a will o whisp
it guides you if you can keep up
to where the treasures lay
so wheres this cave
the hermit didnt say
he got this greedy glinting look the filthy red eyed leech
and said hed tell for thirty bucks
something in blooms face falls
the girls bright trusting face looking at him
a moment of silence
then triumphant an excited boy leaps to his feet
well thats just two bucks each
the kids all rejoice and fist fulls of dollars are thrust at bloom
he looks almost crestfallen as his eye catches the girls joyful gaze
so sunday came
children in their bright sunday clothes run through the dark woods led by bloom
and straight from church into the woods bloom led
in the dim light of a cave stephen overturns the coolers of water and retreats into shadow
a flood soaks into the dirt floor as outside the mouth of the cave the group of panting children come into sight
their hearts leapt
there it was
the children look at the craggy mouth of a forboding cave
just like the hermit said
deep in the caves dark maw a spark of light
the children gasp collectively
the girl grabs blooms arm
bloom stares transfixed as any of them
the spark becomes a glowing fluttering point of light which hangs in the mouth of the cave for a tantalizing moment then recedes deeper into the gloom
with a cry the children bloom included dash into the cave
the light glows just around the next corner
the children run after it slipping in the mud laughing turning the corner
and the light glows just around the next corner
they scramble they slip and slide they cant catch the light but theyre all having the time of their lives
holding the girls hand laughing eyes full of wonder
for just one moment bloom forgot himself and ran too fast
he puts on a burst of speed gets ahead of the crowd
narrator contd hed catch the light and find the treasure
turning a corner he alone sees the rather tawdry image of stephen flashlight in hand shooing him back as he turns the next corner
bloom stops running
narrator contd but the moment passed
the other kids and the girl pass him but bloom stands dead still a strange expression on his face
the girl turns back towards him still running and holds out her hand for him to follow
but he doesnt
he stays behind and is soon left alone
they didnt catch the will o wisp but didnt really care
the muddied children walk home laughing while bloom leans against a lamppost
stephen appears behind him counting their money
it seems to me that in the end the perfect con is where each one involved gets just the thing they wanted
yeah i guess so
our fledgling thieves were satisfied
a front door opens revealing a porch full of angry parents holding muddied kids by their ears
the childrens parents less so
the foster parents exchange a glance
stephen is smacked
the wad of money is snatched from a grubby small hand by an angry big one
a telephone slams down
on a form the field reason for return is filled with larceny
two suitcases on a bed are snapped closed and pulled away
the bed sits solid and vacant in the dusty afternoon sunlight
a bitter ending
but theres sweetness in the mix
beneath the bed forgotten a piece of paper
on it the con flow chart
narrator contd the brothers bloom had found their calling
one of the boxes
narrator contd as shown in number six
box cut ohenrys narrator contd cut meant to negotiate percent percentage deal
through a storefront window rows of the childrens muddy sunday clothes hang each tagged
ohenrys was the towns one dry clean shop
and striding out of the store beneath the ohenrys cleaners sign is stephen fifty dollars in hand sucking a rocket pop
the owner leans out of the door looking a little nervous
stephen throws him back a salute
bloom sits against a wall suitcases beside him
boxes of rocket pops and one in each fist
stephen plops down beside him
so hows it feel
blooms eye catches the children and the girl playing in the distance
in truth young bloom wont know for twenty years just how he felt
a child welfare car waiting out on the street
the brothers pick themselves up
narrator contd and so well skip ahead now in our story
stephen tosses his rocket pop
let em melt
the con man team of the brothers bloom suitcases in hand strides down the alleyway
stephen in front
bloom a few steps behind stealing one last glance back at the children playing in the sun
flames spread over a wall of bookshelves
a young man in a nice suit and bowler hat steps in front of the flaming books
he gets the scarab you get the money i get the girl
so in the end everyone gets everything he wants
three gunshots two bloody holes in the nice suit and the young man folds to the ground
a sweaty man named charleston s lowers his gun while behind him the rest of the library roars in flames
wha charleston what oh my god are you
oh god hes dead victors dead
youve killed us
we had it he was right it was all in the bag and now were dead why
why you stupid son of a bitch
the owner of the voice a man a bit younger than charleston in a derby cap snatches the gun away and slaps charleston hard
cause the turk was right
after seeing her after that night on the airstrip after cairo everything changed and he couldnt see the play through that one milky eye but the turk was right about
one thing that theres nothing beautiful about money
this isnt happening
hell never have her now
and ill never see her in scarlet again her chestnut hair but its worth the money and my job and his life and the rest of my life that shes
i cant be here
youre not here
neither of us are
its mowchers gun
mowcher is at the bottom of the spree with a cowl in his neck
charleston gets to his feet
they wont find him for a week and the albino will chalk it up to davey he wont talk
listen to you four months ago you were an investment banker
now youre nothing
the scarabs lost
the moneys gone
itll rot in the peruvian earth
charleston limps to the flaming doorway
the man named charleston you met nine months and a thousand years ago at the hotel bar in jodhpur is dead
if we see each other again itll be as strangers
as for the money
let it rot
he exits leaving mcguire stooped beside the crumpled form of victor
a long beat
the distant roar of an engine tires squealing
then through the smoky doorway steps a beautiful asian woman early s
she gives a nearly imperceptible nod
he pats victor who sits up spitting blood
mcguire looks to victor and the woman for a reaction
mcguire contd wow is the word youre both looking for
the asian woman nods slightly
un wowishly youre a genius stephen
for mcguire is of course stephen
were a genius bloom
just as victor is indeed bloom
tastes like tin foil
so does real blood
buy you a drink
stephen escorts the asian woman out while bloom wipes his lip
a stately house in the middle of nowhere on fire
stephen holds the door of a car open while bloom steps from the flaming house
four months and a thousand years ago
thats kipling isnt it
he stole that from kipling
hazy light over the sprawling city
a low cozy basement level bar
a dozen people crowd it all expectant in a surprise party type way
a turkish gentleman in a white linen suit and eye patch raises his drink when bloom stephen and the woman enter
make way make room for the brothers bloom
the bar bursts into cheers
a dwarf dances on the bar
stephen plays cards with the turk an albino and a small crowd of character types
nine months six countries three faked deaths for one mark
youre a beautiful antique my friend
they clink glasses
one thing baffles me
the entire con would have fallen apart if charleston had walked away
how did you know hed pull the trigger
stephen riffle shuffles a pack of cards
just think of any card
stephen cuts the deck randomly of spades
but if i do it enough eventually itll work on someone
and then itll be the best card trick in the world
the dwarf slips plummets from the bar
stephen kicks a chair across the room into which he lands with a crunch
stephen contd ante up
its true you never work with the same crew twice
except for the uh for her
back at the bar the asian woman
being hit on by a weasly romanian
yeah im pretty big into anime
she almost imperceptibly rolls her eyes
our fifth beatle
she knows the ins and the outs and so far as i can tell speaks three words of english
she taps on the bar
she says no with a look
so shes with you and bloom till the end
just till the wind changes
stephen makes a gun with his finger and shoots at the chink
she flicks a champaign flute to make a ding
and mimes the bullet bouncing off her
where is bloom
in the corner of the bar in a private booth with drawn velvet curtains bloom sits alone playing solitaire
stuck with a queen of hearts he cant play
a beautiful woman in scarlet with auburn hair pokes her face through the curtains
there you are
ive been learning
stephen likes to talk about you
did he tell you the cave story
is it true
what else did he tell you
im not going to tell it as good as stephen
you two kicked around till your early teens then stowed away on a merchant marine freighter and ended up in st
petersburg where you spent five years under the tutelage of a shadowy old swindler named the diamond dog
and he was your fagin and stephen was his artful dodger but it ended suddenly and badly
stephen took his eye out with an antique rapier
why did he do that
and then the brothers bloom lit out on their own to make their fortune as gentleman thieves
she pushes the cards aside and slides clumsily onto the table her face inches from blooms eyes closed expecting a kiss
blooms eyes stay open
you want to know how stephen did it
its not the first thing on my mind
a replay of bloom in front of the flaming bookshelf
he positioned me in the same spot where seven years ago charlestons wife stood and told him she was leaving
the room transforms becomes daylit not on fire seven years ago a wife standing in blooms place
contd he chose my outfit to mirror her suit
sure enough the colors and shape of blooms suit matches the wifes outfit
contd he even phonetically matched my final words to hers
this is the end
charelston youve always been a dunce
everything snaps back to bloom in the flaming room
so in the end everyone gets everything he wants
thats what he does he writes his cons the way dead russians write novels with thematic arcs and imbedded symbolism and shit
and he wrote me as a vulnerable anti hero
and thats why you think you want to kiss me
its a con
he leaves rose lying on the table and sweeps through the bar towards the exit passing stephen
bloom contd i need air
plays a card thats the big
bloom stumbles up stone steps to street level
a thousand year old man sweeps up across the square
bloom sits wearily on the curb bowler hat in hand shirt bright red with fake blood face long as hell
putting the broom aside a moment the old man walks painfully across the street to bloom
standing nearly toe to toe with him the man pulls a huge joyful smile across his grizzled face
he then smears his hand over his mug pulling the smile off his face and rubbing it on blooms mouth
when he takes his hand away bloom plays along and has the same big joyful smile
the old man winks at him and walks back to his broom
as soon as the old man is away bloom drops the smile
stephen paces out into the street
we missed the sunrise
that wouldve been nice
they walk across the street to the tiergarten
berlins central park and zoo dead and brown
the brothers stroll through the woods stephen a few steps ahead bloom trailing behind lost in thought
camel heads poke over a wall with kamelhaus painted on it
stephen throws open the walls gate
to camels back to the swamps
the camels are unimpressed
bloom slouches into a bench
stephen shows the deck of cards to bloom who nods
stephen cuts the deck shows him a card
bloom shakes his head no
stephen contd at least youre honest
bloom stares into space
stephen contd alright lets do this
lets just get it done
so first you say im quitting stephen
then i say
do we have to go through this again
then you make a show of putting on your jacket and say no i mean it this time stephen this time im really out
then you say lets have a drink and in the morning bloom youll have come to your senses stephen pulls a flask unscrews it
re blooms bright red blood stain thats a major design flaw in fake blood by the way
and well be moving on
real blood turns brown after a half hour
listen to me stephen
this scotch costs more than your suit
listen to me
and the flask stopped a bullet from a black powder rifle at appomattox
bloom bats the flask away
a camel catches it tips its camel neck back and gulps it down
thats my new favorite camel
i hate you
i hate this life i hate it i hate that you wont fucking listen to me for one goddamn second
bloom contd i cant wake up next to another stranger who thinks they know me or even wants to know me cause i dont know who im thirty five years
old and i im useless im crippled i dont ive only ever lived life through these roles that arent me that are written for me by you
tell me what you want
so you can write me a role in a story where i get it
youre not listening to me
i want a real
thing i wanna do things how i dont know are gonna work out a i want a
sotto you want an unwritten life
i want an unwritten life
realizes stephen just wrote that line for him aauuugghh god
the camel belches
bloom makes a show of putting on his jacket
bloom contd im going away
somewhere you or even the chink wont be able to track me down so dont try
no more stories
bloom tosses stephen the bowler and storms off
he gets about ten feet then hesitates
bloom contd i love you
the camel nudges stephens jacket looking for more scotch
stephen puts the bowler on its camel head
stephen watches his brother walk off into the rising morning mist lost in thought
his hands mechanically begin shuffling the pack of cards
beautiful green hills surround the walled medieval city of ferentino
title card ferentino italy months later
a tiny red car inches its way across the countryside
it winds its way up and deeper into the city on the hill
the tiny stone porch outside a private apartment
the red cars bumper pulls up parks
on a small wood table empty booze bottles and a loose pack of cards
fingertips spread the cards then the fingertips owner heads for the apartment door
stephen steps in cautiously surveys the apartment
a goddamn mess
empty bottles and glasses very little light
stephen opens the curtains light streams in the window
a groan of displeasure comes from the gloom
bloom stirs passed out in a hammock
unkept beard a few extra pounds
crushed cigar hanging on his lip
a rotund grandmother waddles in cleaning up bottles and berating bloom in a constant stream of angry italian
shes right you know
why are you here stephen
put on your face lets eat
stephen guides a dressed bloom out the door
the grandmother follows them still barking angry italian at bloom
at the last moment she says a few kind words kisses him on the cheek and sends them off
a few tables on a stone walkway overlooking the countryside
the red car parked nearby
stephen eats bloom stares
howd you find me
howd the chink find me
stephens eyes are you joking
howve you been
ive done a lot of thinking the past three months
you dont want out
you think you do but you dont
i want to show you something
im quits stephen
stephen stands strolls off
bloom wearily follows
bloom contd where are we going
sighs well lemme get my jacket
a long private road through a tunnel of trees leads to a ludicrous mansion
our trio watch it from the road
looks like an etching from a bronte novel
stephen flips open a first edition jane eyre
the illustration inside is in fact an exact match right down to a plaster deer in the front yard
bloom contd huh
look at that
im gonna head back to italy
dad died early mom died two years ago after ten years fighting an illness that i cant pronounce
the chink writes a number in the snow with a stick
just when we think shes done she adds several more zeros
bloom contd jesus
stephen pulls bloom into the trees as a cherry red lamborghini roars down the private road does an unruly donut and crunches painfully into a tree kicking up a cloud
of dust and smoke
thumping bass from the audio system turns off and from the dust cloud emerges penelope early s beautiful but in a non lamborghini way
bloom watches her through the trees none too happy
off to the side of the house
they lean on the hood of their rental car an old school cadillac
in the background a tow truck arrives with a brand new lamborghini and leaves towing the old one
what am i doing here stephen
i have one rule and youve never even tested it
stick with me
you know we dont do women i dont and its not a morality thing or a thing its whatever it is it doesnt matter what it is thats just our
so what are we re the rental car did you rent a caddy
stephen nods to the chink
bloom nods appreciatively
bloom contd controversial choice
so no is what im saying
im quits anyway
ill be in italy
the front door of the mansion slams and they watch penelope drag a harp around into the back yard
lived at home her whole life
blooms eyes never leave penelope
an eccentric shut in rich bitch
youre not helping your case
the chink silently hands bloom a retractable spyglass he watches penelope drift atop a hill and sit on a stump
shes bored a seed in the snow
were going to put her through a grand adventure bring her to life
so this is the big plan
lure me back into things with some beautiful intriguing elusive girl stir up old memories with the prospect of redemption and rebirth
bloom watches her play clash songs on the harp
bloom contd im not saying yes
but whats the con
stephen spreads a folded piece of paper on a tree stump with a flowchart on it
bloom doesnt take his spyglass off penelope
its actually pretty simple
were brothers antique dealers perusing the americas for antiquities en route to someplace exciting via luxury steamer say greece
you tie into her and work your magic
penelope plays on
bloom and stephen in armchairs collars loosened drinks drunk
the chinks chuck taylors stick up over the back of a chair
bloom holds the con flowchart
and so thats how it ends in mexico a burst of violence then a moment of truth on the beach
what do you think
bloom idly looks over the chart
youve got something up your sleeve
this is about me right
this might not be something you know but theyve all been about you
maybe thats why theyve none of them been perfect ive never been able to give you what you really want
i want to be outta all this
so by definition this is not going to give me what i want
stephen answers by letting an ace fall from his sleeve
bloom contd this will be the last one
youll let me go
the chinks inert sneakers come to life and shes on her feet silently going to stephens side
i will never approach you to do another con again
to the chink lets make it a red schwinn
bloom stares at on the flowchart bloom meets penelope
a grumpy bloom perched on the red schwinn an ill fitting styrofoam helmet on his head
stephen sits in a lawn chair watching the highway below
the chink sets up a lawn umbrella a chair for herself and a cooler with coronas
there are less painful ways to cut into a mark
wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk
score to beat is
keep your head in the game the chinese judge is tough
this is a banana seat man
he directs this to the chink who blinks with innocent incomprehension and opens two coronas
bloom contd dont give me that blank look you know what a fuckin banana seat is
stephen spots something and blows a whistle
with a grunt bloom launches the schwinn forward
gaining speed bumping over weeds and gopher holes down the steep steep hill
at the bottom of the hill a two lane highway
cruising down the highway a cherry red lamborghini
whose front right fender bloom expertly smashes into
silent and blue
time slows to a crawl as bloom sails through the air arcing over the italian luxury cars hood and past a horrified penelope face frozen mid scream behind the wheel
theres actually a knack to this
you want to avoid dying or breaking anything that wont grow back but you dont want to roll out of it and come up roses
if youre trying to fast track into a marks sympathies theres nothing quite as efficient as having your first conversation be from a hospital bed they put you in
i usually like to try for a dislocated shoulder
several things happen at once
bloom hits the pavement shoulder first hard
the bent bike follows suit
up on the hill stephen and the chink raise score cards
the lamborghini screeches to a stop
everything is still
then the car jolts forward
then again jolts and stops
rolls forward a few feet lazily drifting then jolts and stops
bloom painfully stands as confused by the cars behavior as us
stephen and the chink lower their cards equally confused
one last long beat of silence then the car jolts forward veers drunkenly to the left tips into a ditch and chunks to a stop
the horn blares
bloom looks up to the hilltop for guidance
stephen stares blankly
the chink raises a new score card
penelope sleeps bruised and battered
bloom sits bedside uncomfortably arm in a wimpy sling
bloom leans forward
slurred with sleep and drugs she painfully barely breathes are you alright
bloom consults with stephen and the chink both in scrubs
the chink had it im telling him i know thank you in her report i missed it
this is actually kind of great ill tell you why
the chink lights a cigarette
you missed it
dostoevsky was an epileptic
his seizures were preceded by an enlightened euphoria a sort of opening of his spiritual eye
stephen contd i think the fact that she saw your face the instant before a seizure is a pretty goddamn good foot to start things out on right
bloom stares blankly
the chink burps into her stethoscope
bloom slumps in a chair watching penelope sleep
the next step is to figure out a way to insinuate yourself into their personal life
bloom drifts off then wakes with a start
it is morning
penelope is shaking him
i think they took my car
could you drive me home
she walks away the back of her gown wide open then turns
im penelope stamp
bloom drives penelope gazes stiffly out the window
find a connection with your mark through conversation
bloom contd im sorry about your lamborghini
he notices her playing with the side mirror knob angling it to stare at him while looking out the window
this car is like riding in a huge marshmallow
and still more silence
having now deftly set your hook in the marks psyche this would be the perfect time to tug the line they pull up in the car
a tow truck is dropping off a new lamborghini
get invited in for coffee and tell them the full tale
bloom looks about to launch into something when penelope drops a stack of cash bound in a green rubber band on his dashboard
for the bike and the whole thing
this was a big shit sandwich
the car door slams and shes gone
bloom sits a moment
however there are advantages to playing it cool
letting it lie for a day or two then casually re establish contact
bloom starts driving off and adjusts the passenger side mirror so it points back to the road
as he does he sees penelope in it sprinting after his car
a moment later she appears at his window heaving
i should have
invited you in
bloom and penelope sit in a luxurious stone based kitchen neither touching their coffee
this is how penelope listens she starts with her eyes on bloom then very quickly drifts away into her own thoughts then recognizes shes doing it and makes eye contact
again and gives an overbaked oh yes go on smile nod then does it all again
three or four times
didnt really have anyone except each other growing up and our father was in the antique business he had a shop in charleston
so we stuck together my brother stephen and me we and just took over the shop when dad died
then we realized one day we saw the dealers who were finding and selling us the antiques coming from exotic countries all over the world and there was a almost
a scent they had when theyd come in the dusty shop we worked nine to five in since we were nineteen the air would like before a rain the ions would line up and you could just smell midnight trains to paris and steamer ships and calcutta bazaars and we made the decision we just did it that we want to have that sort of life
so we did and weve been travelling and treasure hunting the world ever since and could you im sorry stop doing that youre im ok
im really bad at talking to people
i told you thats alright
you want me to go
i want to talk to you
she storms out
penelope leans against the window looking out
so what kind of stuff do you do
maybe you should go
im just gonna finish my coffee first
very slowly he sips it
each sip becomes a noisier and noisier slurp
i collect hobbies
i see someone doing something i like and i get books and learn how to do it
in which penelope demonstrates the following with exacting seriousness and skill for bloom playing the piano
the classical guitar
putting the finishing touches on a ship in a bottle
executing a perfect ollie on a skateboard
juggling various items
riding a unicycle
juggling while riding a unicycle
playing ping pong against a wall with ungodly speed
karate chopping through too much wood
playing the accordion
rapping to a drum machine
creating a perfect origami dragon
on blooms shell shock face
is that it
i know a lot of stuff
you just learned this stuff here by yourself
so you just thought so i want to learn this and this and you just did it
how do you plan to use all these skills
im not a planner
i just do stuff
here look at this watermelon
its a camera
you can make a pinhole camera out of anything hollowish and dark
its gotta warp the image though right
no yeah it does
thats what the taj majal taken by a fat tourist with diarrhea and a point and shoot camera can be the flattest dullest heres us at the taj majal oh
lovely lets go stick our thumbs up our asses picture
but you can look at the most menial everyday thing and depending on how your pinhole camera eats the light its warped and peculiar and imperfect
its not reproduction its storytelling
its a lie that tells the truth
i dunno about truth
a photograph is a secret about a secret
the more it tells you the less you know
whats changed between now and twenty minutes ago
cause this is kinda like a conversation
bloom and penelope walk and talk finally rounding the house and ending up at the driveway
well i should uh its late
i meet a lot of people in my job i have to professionally act interested in
its a good feeling to be genuinely interested in someone
are you leaving
are you coming back
well next time im in town
were taking a steamer at noon tomorrow off the docks to the continent for a few months
during this bloom very naturally moves his hand to the small of penelopes back
the edge of his thumb comes to rest on a small slit of exposed skin
penelopes expression does not change but a noticeable blush crosses her still face
when bloom removes his hand the blush falls
bloom contd paris and greece i think
ive gotta get a hat
thanks for the pinhole camera demonstration
and for the good conversation
he drives off
she stands in the doorway watching him go
a jaunty steamer ship docked and ready
bloom watches the access road stephen makes notes the chink whittles
i need another day with her
youll have two weeks on the boat
i need another day to get her on the boat she isnt hooked
that bit i skipped where we were talking in the backyard it was ten minutes on the optics of lensless photography we didnt really talk
it isnt the talking that hooked her
bloom turns from the road
i think youre wrong
a screech of distant tires and a crash
bloom doesnt look
bloom contd contd though every time i say that you end up being comically right
thats her isnt it
penelope pulls a clumsy steamer trunk that never could have fit in her lamborghini which is bent around a pylon
bloom meets her
what are you doing here
she holds out the stack of bills in the green rubber band
you left this money in my kitchen
he doesnt take it
yeah i didnt want it but thanks
beat hey wheres this boat going
the good ship fidele breaks the waves greece ward
bloom and penelope stroll the deck
why did you decide to come
well id never been to greece
or outside new jersey
it just seems like a big leap
from where you were at yesterday to being a world traveler
it looked like fun
i wanted to do it
a new hobby
up ahead bloom spots a large man in a fur collared cape gazing out to sea
he quickly turns penelope away
bloom contd here this way
the chink and stephen play shuffleboard
bloom leads penelope to them
penelope this is my brother stephen
pleased to make your acquaintance
blooms told me about you youre the epileptic photographer
this is my personal secretary and masseuse mrs
a nearly imperceptible glare from the chink
yuengling like the beer
so what are your plans in greece
i dont plan
good for you
the chink hits a damn near impossible shuffleboard shot then gives stephen a pointed deferential giggle bow
the brothers dress for dinner
you named the chink yuengling
i was writing in a bar
and she doesnt drink how does she know a philly beer
she knows a lot of stuff
beat was that who i thought it was on the east deck this morning
yes it was
did he spot you
an ominous glance
several small tables scattered about the moonlit deck bloom and penelope sit with flutes of champagne
penelope in an elegant but understated dress shuffles a pack of cards
you look very nice
she laughs as if at a joke she doesnt think is funny
bloom contd what was your childhood like
i make cameras out of watermelons
penelopes hands move faster
she knows how to shuffle cards
how was it lonely
fishing for an entertaining childhood anecdote that encapsulates my adult issues
well its funny how everyones usually got one
as penelope tells her story she gets fancier with her shuffles
when i turned six i started getting allergies hayfever rashes really bad
so my mom took me into the doctor and he did that test where they use needles to prick a grid on your back with all the different toxins to
see which ones youre allergic to
the next day i came in the doctor lifted up my shirt and my back looked like a patch of oily moldy blackish green double puff marshmallows
i was allergic to everything
so they sealed the house with plastic and a special ventilation system and i spent my entire childhood and adolescence indoors
she pulls the queens out of the deck and lays them face up on the table
it wasnt til i was nineteen they discovered what i was actually allergic to was the aluminum alloy the hypodermic needle was made out of
then i was going to leave but my mom got sick
so i stayed
and she stayed sick a long time
do you feel cheated
penelope does an amazing card trick using the four queens
the trick to not feeling cheated is to learn how to cheat
so i decided this wasnt a story about a miserable girl trapped in a house that smelled like medical supplies wasting her life on a dying person she sometimes hated
it was about a girl who could find infinite beauty in anything any little thing
and do anything she decided to do
and love the person she was trapped with
so i told myself that story until it became true
now did doing that let me escape a wasted life or did it just blind me so i wouldnt want to escape it
i dont know
but either way i was the one telling my own story
so i dont feel cheated
she finishes the trick
a single pair of hands clapping turns their heads
at the far end of the deck alone at a table the large man in the fur collared cape who for reasons unlikely to become clear at the moment will
be called the curator
and a magician is just an actor playing the part of a magician
bloom takes penelope gently by the elbow and guides her up and away
they stroll out onto the moonlit bow of the ship
who is that man
you avoided him earlier on the deck
i dont know but hes carrying a knife up his sleeve and wearing a cape
do me a favor and steer clear of him
a waltz drifts through the air from a band unseen
bloom contd contd i dont suppose in all your hobby acquiring you ever learned how to dance
i went through a phase when i was mildly obsessed with the bolero
give me a minute
he leaves her alone
clouds obscure the moon shadows deepen
a match strikes
the moon re emerges and she is no longer alone on the deck
the curator lights a dapper briar pipe shakes out the match
in french subtitled i didnt mean to startle you
in french subtitled yes you did
in french subtitled apologies but the deck was dark and i had to approach
english its been such a time since ive encountered the brothers bloom
youre in antiques
cheshire grin antiques
i wonder my dear if you know the true nature of the men you travel with
the band strikes up a bolero
the curator flicks his wrist and a long thin blade falls into his hand
the curator contd a little fear might suit you i think
he raises the blade
it is in fact a fine mustache brush which he delicately employs
the curator contd bon soir ma cherie
with that the curator backs into the shadows and is gone
moments later bloom trots up to her oblivious
it isnt a spanish band but theyll do their best
he hands her a single blood red rose
she puts it in her teeth and they dance
if there is a tinge of tension in the air the bolero suits it
the moon ducks behind a cloud once more and they dance on in the dark
bloom wakes with a start
morning light pours in through his porthole
he opens it looks out to sea
his dinner jacket draped over a chair
the rose in its lapel
he fishes it out
runs his fingers over the teeth marks on the stem
then raises an eyebrow at a lump in the breast pocket and pulls out the stack of bills in the green rubber band
the chink and penelope lie on their stomachs on the deck a beer can pinhole camera between them
penelope gives a lesson on how it works
the chink appreciates her
bloom escorts penelope to breakfast
howd you find her
the chi nese uh yeungling
she found us
bloom cooks breakfast in his bathrobe
a few years back when we hit the top of our art dealing game she just appeared
a door opens and slams
the chink sits at his place at the table suitcase beside her smoking a cigarette
contd shes stuck with us
we figure when she gets bored shell vanish with the same lack of noise
like feeding a strange animal bloom pours her coffee
she drinks it without looking at him
i like her
they smile when they see stephen and the chink at a table
their smiles drop when they see the curator sitting with them
bloom glares at the curator but speaks to stephen
bloom contd whats he doing here
i invited him sit down
this ships too small to dance around each other for a week we might as well have it out now
penelope do you know our friend
only as the creepy frenchman
you know languages but not accents my dear
i am belgian
maxmillion melville at your service
also known in certain professional circles as the curator
pleased to make your acquaintance
what do you do
im a curator presently for the national museum in prague
im an epileptic photographer
good for you
what do you do
we have a legitimate antique reselling business
baissez le rideau la farce est jouee
weve gone straight max
pardon but you do not ascend to the grand heights of the brothers bloom only to toss it all and sell terra cotta to blue haired weekend antiquers
eat your waffles
but mademoiselle appears
perhaps she is unawares
eat your waffles fat man
unaware that the brothers bloom are in fact the two most highly respected art smugglers in the western world
weve been on the straight for three years
so thats that
well if that is that then that is indeed that
as you say
penelope snaps her fingers
everyone looks up
your names melville
maxmillion melville esquire
sorry no cause i noticed but i couldnt place it this ship is the fidele which was the ship in melvilles novel the confidence man
so thats weird
everyone glances at stephen a little uncomfortable
bloom paces stephen shuffles cards
i know you like to throw those clever little details in but youve gotta watch that shit with her stephen
she had a lot of time alone in that house and she used it
she did the best double dutch queens ive ever seen up on the deck last night
double dutch queens uses gaffed cards
she had them in her purse and cut them in while i was folding my napkin
thats what im saying
shes different she knows sometimes it feels like she knows everything
doesnt that worry you
but something about her is worrying you plenty
she feels like one of your characters
the day i con you is the day i die bloom
i know that
beat how did you get the belgian on our budget
hes beautiful right
i didnt expect him to actually be belgian
im not sure he is
im to bed
stephen stands to go then pauses
stephen contd contd ive always protected you right
the only real danger in this whole play is that youll actually fall in love with her
look at me
dont fall in love with her
the chink sits smoking her whittled pipe watching bloom alone on the deck
stephen passes her and she stops him with a look
i know what im doing
she hands him a thin piece of paper
he looks it over
stephen contd this came through just now
the paper is a telegram with the fideles imprint received from st
stephen reads it
stephen contd my dear stephen stop word on the wire is the bros b are bound for prague stop am heading there myself would love to see my boys stop
the diamond dog
he crumples the paper looks down at bloom
stephen contd wire him back for me
dear dog stop unless youve lately felt an excess of eyes left in your head kindly stay the fuck away from me and my brother stop regards etcetera
the good ship fidele rounds the rock of gibraltar
bloom and penelope lie on the deck watching dolphins
she says this word like shes eating chocolate smugglers
its like an adventure story
whose idea was it to go straight
stephen always loved the life
then he was almost killed on a run to jakarta two thugs with heads like canned hams worked him beyond all reason
stephen is set upon by two thugs
he rushes them
have at thee you ham headed bastards
and i called it that was it
stephen enjoyed it
he loved the idea that we were internationally infamous art smugglers but i think deep down same as me he felt like we were putting on a persona faking it
telling a story
hed love to die on a job
cornered at midnight on a run to jakarta
thats his dream to tell his story so well it fulfills itself
it somehow would make it finally real for him
thats kinda the thing we all want right
he looks at her in the sun
trying to get something real by telling yourself stories is a trap
trust me on that one
kalamata if it matters
the fidele docked in bright blue water
our intrepid heroes stand aside a dusty road surrounded by their luggage
the curator approaches tips his hat to them
best of luck with the antiquing boys
au revoir chinois
the curator contd to penelope mademoiselle
mes restes doffre
with a wink he is gone
penelope stands apart
my french is a little rusty but i believe he just told you my offer stands
he came out of nowhere last night
penelope taking air on the moonlit deck
the curator dissolves out of the darkness
whatevers in his pipe it made me thick
he brings her face close to hers smoke twisting and speaks unheard words low and fast
what has he got
an th century prayer book
we fly through the city streets
from his museum in prague stashed in the castle
up to the base of the castle through a grated hole in an ancient wall into
a stunning illuminated manuscript lies open on a stone table
the curators hands close it gently and take it away
a book of hours
medieval art bores the crap out of me so i dont know it that well
so thats what he does he makes pieces in his collections disappear then sells them off via a trusted middleman
thats what he does
wonder whos his fence
probably his spanish guy right
asks penelope did he say whos buying
a gentleman from argentina
hes quite sick cancer in his bones and desperate for sentimental reasons to own this piece while he may
hell sell it to a middleman for one million us
a guy will pay two point five
is he legit
thats a relative term
hes telling the truth
im sorry you had to deal with that guy
behind penelope two porters load her steamer trunk into the back of a taxi
bloom contd wheres that cab going
the train station
wheres the train going
penelope contd lets do it
lets just i want to try this
lets be smugglers
i think itd be fun
we should do this
well first off we dont have a million dollars
i do ive got thats whatever
i mean a real reason
this is real its dangerous it could go very bad
i think a little real danger might suit me
im gonna do it
penelope contd so if you want to join my smugglers gang you know ill consider it
she walks off towards the taxi
this is not an adventure story
what are you talking about
it totally is
a train roars through the night towards prague
stephen reclines hat on his face
take it easy
shes having fun thats the point of this
shes making a flag for our smugglers gang man
she made me learn a secret smugglers handshake
this afternoon when she was writing in the observation car
she is getting way too into this
bloom fishes a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket and thrusts it in front of stephens face
on it are written dozens of variations in stylized fonts of penelope the smuggler
bloom contd shes been singing the smuggler song since athens
what smugglers song
you know the one from whatsit the disney thing that smuggler song the were a band of smugglers hey la la la la la we smuggle by night and drink
by day smugglers ho ho ho smugglers
there this isnt
there isnt a smuggler song is there
she made up a smuggler song
with hand motions
the whole point of this was to sweep her off her feet
let her enjoy it
while it lasts
stephen sighs and drops his hat back on his face
footsteps pound by outside
penelope and the chink run past his door
a moment later a uniformed attendant runs past
a beat then the footsteps come back and the girls duck into blooms cabin slamming the door
sacks in their teeth
off blooms quizzical look smuggling
from the snack car
they pull bags of chips and tiny liquor bottles from their sacks
bloom glares at the chink who tries to avoid his gaze
bloom pays the snack car attendant from a stack of euros while the chink gives him counts on her fingers
are you kidding me
im not paying for that
she holds up two fingers the attendant pours two
she says no with a look they drink
she made up the smuggler song
the chink nods
bloom pays for the jameson
bloom contd i thought it was a disney thing
the lights are off
penelope reclines on the bed surrounded by empty tiny gin bottles
bloom sits on the floor both framed in a big window looking out on a breathtaking moonlit landscape rolling hypnotically by
gin is fuckin fruity
have you taken this train before
so this is all like fuckin whatever to you
i usually drink with the chink in the snack car play cards
with the who
thats her smuggler nickname
i think if it were offensive to her shed let us know
do i get a smuggler nickname
bloom quietly slips the stack of cash in the green rubber band into penelopes luggage
i think youre constipated
in your fuckin soul
bloom makes several attempts to form a response to this before giving up
youve got a big load of grumpy petrified poop up your ass im just calling you out on it
yeah im pretending im a smuggler so you know what
im a fuckin smuggler
if thats your thing fuckin tell it like you own it
when youve got a spotlight in front of your feet man fuckin jump into it and dance the shit out of it
stop fuckin thinking so much
enjoy the fuckin ride
a roll of thunder and spectacular flash of lightning ignites the landscape and rain starts to patter
penelope contd whoa
look im not shh
i love thunderstorms
lying on her stomach penelope slowly starts feeling something which makes her undulate
bloom stares confused
penelope contd whoa ha
oh ho ho
ohhhhhh whoooo ha ha ha ha
beneath her the train wheels rhythmically clack and vibrate against the tracks
another flash of lightening the rain falls harder
bloom silently shrinks back in terror
penelope contd oh hooooooooooo ha ha ha ha ha ha ha oh my god ha whoooo
the door to her car latches and bloom is gone
bloom sits drinking and playing cards with the chink
he spaces out she snaps her fingers to wake him up
playing a card thats the big
the train steams onward into the growing storm
our intrepid four stroll the bridge the citys castle looming before them
penelope slumps pale faced in dark glasses
the last time i was in prague i was in love
what was she like
bloom and i will secure us lodging the brothers set their suitcases on the beds
bloom finds the stack of bills in the green rubber band in his
yeungling will scout the castle museum
the chink in ridiculous tourist garb and a property of kgb t shirt takes pictures with one of several cameras around her neck
you will go to the bank that wire should have cleared if you put it in at athens
only movie thugs and russians deal in suitcases of cash
draw a certified check
a cashier hands over an elaborate check which penelope signs and puts in an envelope
a baroque spiral staircase the spine of a high apartment building
our intrepid four ring the bell beside an apartment door
who the hell is that
who is it
its us max
stephen pushes open the door and an instant later a shotgun blast takes out a chunk of the landing beside his head
they all dive onto the floor piling on top of each other
who the hell are you what do you want who the hell
its us bloom max
its stephen and stephen jesus max easy bloom easy whoa christ whoa
the curator stands in the smoky apartment hallway sloppily draped in a ratty bathrobe bottle in one hand and shotgun in the other
he squints at them
the curator contd ah
i have been drinking
a schematic of the castle laid on the kitchen table
the curator looks even worse in the light red rimmed eyes heavy skin on his face
here off the basilica are offices of administration and beneath those an otherwise inaccessible section of catacombs
and the book
so how do you steal the book
the book is already stolen
the stealing is in the bureaucracy in the filing red tape
as far as the museum is concerned the book does not exist
i am the curator i walk in pinch the copy girls baboosh put the book in a briefcase and walk out
tomorrow say at two
today is not a good day
now what about this argentinian
blank then realizes ah the argentine
senor luise belguta rioso
i get his file
penelope and bloom wander into the bedroom looking at an array of beautiful paintings on the wall
gin is slow death man
stephen and the chink poke their heads in leaving
the curator strolls in
well see you back at the hotel
glances at the curator soon
they go leaving bloom and penelope who squints at an unframed oil on canvas of a lonely stone well in a primeval forest clearing
it sits at the foot of an unmade bed
from a private collection on the island of ikaria
who painted it
i dont know
why is it the last thing you see every night and the first thing you see every morning
thats a story
you have a minute
he closes the blinds and sits on a stool in front of the painting
setting the stage
the curator contd my daughter travelled with me when she was very young and id show her the places and the art all the most joyous and terrifying things in
memories of his daughters hand in his flashing against the sun
the curator contd contd i wanted that the world was alive in the most fantastic way for her
to built her a pair of wings
make these things real
but maybe more than any other objet dart she loved to hear shed ask to hear the story of the stone golem
from a painting in a small private collection on the island of ikaria
he motions to the painting and we move into it
as he tells the story the scenes are shown in the painting just as still images which we move across like a picture book
the curator contd contd well rachel like most monsters the golem was once a human
a boy about your age
the curator contd contd and one day the boy was walking home and he quarrelled he fought with a good friend of his
they got very angry and his friend pushed him a certain way and the boy fell and struck his head and died
the boys friend was very sad but also very frightened
so instead of telling the boys parents he did something awful
he pulled the body into a quarry a pit of broken rocks and hid the boy beneath a pile of large stones
years went by and the boys friend became a young man and one day while drinking in town which in his guilt he did quite a lot of he heard
that a well was being built near the forest
with the stones from the quarry
he ran to the quarry to find it nearly empty
no stones no body
he ran to the well where the masons were finishing their work
did they find anything strange in the quarry
he asked expecting maybe hoping theyd arrest him for the awful crime on the spot
but no they said motioning to the well
they left him alone there at the well and he stood looking into it as the sun fell behind the mountains and twilight set the world in a deep still
the last image we land on is the well alone in the clearing
its dark innards loom ominously in the long pregnant silence that follows
then with a piercing roar a living monster of stone lunges out of the well animated and terrifying grabs the friend by the throat and with a crunching of bones
and one last roar pulls him back down into the depths of the well
we pull out of the painting back to the curator sitting very still
the curator contd my daughter died nineteen years ago today
she was six
she went out to play one afternoon and vanished
the curator contd the next morning we found her in a stone well on a neighboring property
i climbed down to her but slipped and broke my leg and while we waited for the rescue team to pull us out she died in my arms
if youve had a child
my whole everything just focused down to one thing to hold her and make her feel safe
but no matter what i said to her i couldnt stop her shaking crying
her last moments on this earth were filled with terror
of a stone golem
he stands opens the blinds pours another drink
the curator contd it was the first painting i acquired
i keep it maybe hoping some night the golem will come for me
bloom trots out ahead of penelope
bloom keeps going anxious to leave but penelope lingers on the staircase
the curator comes out
the curator contd it is you i do business with yes
she gives him the envelope with the certified check
he shakes her hand then deftly adjusts his grip so that just for a moment he holds her hand as you would hold a childs
he lets go and smiles apologetically
penelope and bloom stroll home in silence through crowded vibrant cobblestone streets
you arent constipated
what are you scared of
they walk on suddenly somehow holding hands
as they approach the hotel bloom deftly breaks their hand holding off
penelope notices why
stephen up in the window watching them approach
he recedes into the room
the sun sets against the castle taking us into night
bloom drinks alone sketching penelopes face with a pencil
a smell breaks his concentration
diamond dog carrying a cup and a cane
standing behind him a soft old man in an ashy suit and eyepatch
the diamond dog
how long has it been
sits orders tea
to bloom can you believe that
been a long while
if i call stephen down hell kill you
well then please dont call stephen down
look at you youre terrified
cmon now look
take a look
im an old man with no depth perception
you dont have to be scared of me
the dog plays with a heavy gold lighter making sparks
diamond dog contd its been a funny thing watching you boys take what i taught you and eclipse me
im so proud to be a footnote in the lives of the brothers bloom
and you hate me
the curse of all bad fathers that my presence on this earth after i die will not live on the lips of admiring men but will sink into the murky
backwaters of my childrens psyches
is this profundity
cause you can skip it
piss and vinegar
the dog scoots next to bloom
diamond dog contd when i first took you boys in showed you the ropes haunting st
petes piss and vinegar
i still crave that youthful joy
the dogs hand touches blooms leg
there is something horrible about this
beneath the bar bloom grips the sharp pencil like a knife
dont touch me
you probably wont believe i loved you boys very much
youre going to take your hand away or im going to break your arm theres nothing between
he does but blooms fingers dont loosen on the pencil
but love you know
we know folks like us you can always blink and realize that its a fiction and like peter walking on water or wiley coyote running off a cliff if you
look down in doubt youll fall
thats the price of our lives the wax in our wings
one day stephens going to fall
it may be glorious but hes going to fall hard and he wont be there to tell you what to do and protect you
when hes gone remember me
the dog has moved in very close to bloom his breath hot on his face and his hand comes to rest fully on blooms leg
blooms hand with the pencil quivers about to strike when bloom is pulled from the bar stool by a heavy hand
stephen his eyes burning through the dog
diamond dog contd hello stephen
stephen smashes a bottle from the bar and slashes it across the dogs hand
waiters and porters tackle him the dog howls holding his bleeding hand
bloom stands numb and puts the pencil in his pocket
bloom watches the dog get into a waiting black mercedes
for an instant the cars interior light shows an year old boy behind the tinted glass as the dog slides in and puts his arm around him
the mercedes drives off
right in front of the hotel on the water
bloom sips coffee from a china cup spinning a paper in his hands
stephen joins him with a matching cup
im sorry i wasnt there
you cant always be there
no i guess cant
that was a real tonal shift
the curators tale
on one side of the paper is the sketch of penelope on the other is the con flowchart
the curators tale
castle break in
im a big fan of tonal shifts
i didnt write it for him though
he made it up on the spot
i dont know
bloom flops into bed
he turns and looks at the wall
right on the other side of it
penelope lies in bed looking at the wall also
she closes her eyes
blooms breathing slows
he closes his eyes
then light snoring breaks the silence coming through the wall
bloom smiles slightly
what a cute snore
the snoring deepens slightly
the clock on the wall advances from am to am and through the window the horizon glows with the approach of dawn
bloom lies wide awake on his back red rimmed eyes wide open the guttural snoring ringing in his ears
our four at the curators door
bloom knocks and they all step judiciously back
were a little early
still and silent in the breaking light of morning
and totally empty
picked clean down to the bare walls
the only thing left in the apartment is the painting of the well
broken on the floor
our intrepid four stand in various states of thoughtfulness
penelope stares at the painting bloom at the window
the golem came for him
in my dream
crawled out of the painting and killed him in a horrible way
well at least he had the decency to just skip out on us not do something tacky like fake his own death
poking around the room bloom opens a closet
the curator stands pressed against the back wall in his pajamas
sotto youre a little early
bloom quickly closes it
i dont get it
if he was hightailing it he could have waited eight hours till we traded the million for the book and had some traveling money
back to antiquing
nothing gained nothing lost
to penelope and you got to see prague which is nice
penelopes eyes widen with realization
you should stay in the city for awhile they have these amazing puppet show opera things but stephen raises a hand to shut him up
several empty glasses of wine one full one in penelopes hand
all heads are slumped
its my fault
i cant believe i left you alone with him
the chink hands stephen a piece of paper
he glances at it
the check was cashed yesterday afternoon hed have deposited it in a swiss account
im sorry pen
what a waste
bloom puts his hand on her arm sympathetic
penelope contd that poor man
what a waste
blooms expression turns quizzical
penelope contd that poor argentina man
hell never see the book now itll just rot in the catacombs
what a waste
when penelope lifts her suddenly brightened eyes in a moment of divine inspiration bloom meets her gaze with fear
bloom paces penelope looks up at the castle with binoculars
the chink and stephen stand by
cant you see what happened here there is no book weve been swindled but maybe there is maybe its real we dont know
its not real its a con
its my money im going to find out for sure
he gave us every piece of information we need
she spreads the castle floor plan out on a bench
bloom turns to stephen and the chink with a this is crazy right
expression and gesture
they give him nothing back
wed need to clear the administrative offices
some sort of disruption
the chink strokes her chin in mock thoughtfulness
to bloom cmon
help me break into this castle
itll be fun
a barbie doll set up in the middle of the field explodes in a theatrical plume of fire
several others follow suit
the chink pops up from behind a mound of dirt in her aviator goggles cigarette dangling from her lip
she leans on a detonator plunger
bloom stephen and penelope crouch nearby watching her work
shes an artist with nitroglycerin
its kind of her thing
i feel like i want to know more about her
check the tat
on the back of the chinks neck a few finely scripted lines of chinese
stephen contd an inky wisp of personal information
we transcribed it brought it into a chinese restaurant
whats it say
the literal translation is something about water cranes but essentially it means when youre done with something blow it up
the chink lies on the floor with penelope showing her how to build a tiny remotely detonated bomb
she slices a tiny bit off a brick of dynamite sets it in a petri dish with a detonator and puts the whole thing in a handbag
penelope appreciates her
bloom and stephen hunker over the castle floorplan
theres a smoke detector in these empty rooms in the east tower
so we plant and set off a tiny to the chink tiny tiny tiny charge
the chink clicks a seemingly innocent ballpoint pen
with a beep a tiny poof of fire plumes from the handbag setting it on fire and the smoke rises to the ceiling
stephen contd fire drill ensues offices empty and youll have exactly four and a half minutes to get through the access hatch into the catacombs get the book and get
out before the fire department arrives
penelope and the chink do their elaborate handshake and she gives stephen and bloom a finger snap thumbs up
bloom and penelope up late at the table
going over the floorplan one more time
so straight down the corridor again tell me where
second left third right access hatch behind the copier i need to sleeeeeeep
the abort code if we need to abort is corned beef
for some reason
bloom i need to sleep
he folds up the plans she wraps up the brick of dynamite and bomb components and spots a black leather backpack beside an open handbag on the table
penelope contd is this yeunglings backpack
she gently puts the brick of stabilized nitroglycerin inside the front zipper compartment and sets the tiny petri dish bomb beside the handbag
you know what i feel
all my big talk
but this isnt a story its real
she kisses him
he kisses her back
the pure whole hearted sensuality with which they attack each other and the deluge of almost child like need let loose in this one simple act quickly reaches a point
where as a viewer we no longer feel comfortable intruding with our gaze
fifteen seconds after this point we fade out
the sun arcs into the sky above the castle
bloom half wakes
across the landscape of the bed penelope sleeps
sunlight on her body and her sleeping face
from the next room over
blooms eyes snap open
in his boxers holding trousers and shirt in his teeth bloom swings over the ledge from penelopes window into his
he opens the door for stephen who regards him narrowly
the chink picks up the backpack handbag and petri dish bomb
penelope folds a plastic bag and puts it under her jacket
a little alcove with a good view of the castle
stephen trains his gaze on one set of windows high in the eastern tower
an empty storage room half under construction
the chink walks in wearing the backpack and carrying the handbag
she goes straight for a spot just under a smoke detector
stephen bloom and penelope are joined by the chink
he looks through his binoculars again
they share a brief moment with their eyes and penelope trots off
the chink caught it
she looks at bloom slyly
for the record im still against this
why send her in alone
the chink finds a way to casually smell blooms fingers
because going in alone is a very important thing to do
shes walking into a zero security tourism office during a fire drill and taking a five hundred dollar manuscript replica from a utility crawlspace
worst case scenario a file clerk asks if shes lost
which isnt even going to happen
to the chink shes in position
he spots penelope casually waiting beside an unmarked door
bloom notices the chink looking at him with a knowing grin
she mimes sealing her lips and tossing the key
she then takes the ballpoint pen detonator
out of the handbag dangling at her hip
stephen contd cause nobodys going to know we were ever here
bloom spots the handbag
somethings not right
uh the chink clicks the pen
the black backpack sitting under the smoke alarm beeps
a thunderous explosion blows a massive ten foot wide chunk out of the side of the eastern tower spewing a painfully dramatic ball of fire and debris
our three look up at the tower agape
bloom grabs the binoculars from stephen looks for penelope
panicked tourists stumble away from the descending dust
penelope sees whats happened but holds her ground
the unmarked door opens and a dozen business people pour out
dont do it dont do it penelope dont theyre locking down the castle she wont get in
she takes a step towards the door
bloom drops the binoculars and sprints
a burly security guard trots across the courtyard herding tourists and smoking a cigar
to ze back no panic to ze back
he blocks the office door and sets his cigar down for a moment
penelope spots it
bloom nears the courtyard sees penelope up ahead
penelope deftly spins the cigar degrees
the guard absently picks it up and puts it back in his mouth fire side first
he howls doubles over
she dashes into the door
bloom bursts out of the crowd and lunges for the door but a second security guard stops him
dozens more security guards swarm in
overhead an army helicopter buzzes by
bloom stares into the doorway helpless and scared
water rains down from the ceiling sprinklers
penelope weaves through the halls
cramped ill lit and with its own sprinkler
penelope dashes in shoulders the massive cold war era copy machine and with a herculean effort pulls it away from the wall
im in prague
i burned a mans lips off to break into a castle in prague
revealing an access hatch
penelope shuts the hatch behind her
light from a barred window illuminates a rectangular shape lying on a stone slab
penelope approaches the small book of hours reverently
a full view of the castle reveals just about the worst case scenario
the entire area swarms with army helicopters and tanks soldiers with rifles yellow tape news crews
stephen bloom and the chink sit behind the police line on the bridge with the rest of the crowds
heads in their hands
penelope is broken out of her stupor by heavy footsteps all around her soldiers searching the castle
voices right outside the hatch
she slides the wimpy little bolt shut
she looks up a moldy vent in the muddy ceiling
bloom suddenly stands
wait were fine
if the soldiers find her wandering the halls theyll assume shes a clerk theyll just shoo her out
so as long as she doesnt do anything suspicious shes fine
penelope wriggles on her belly through a tin ventilation duct barely big enough for her
the book encased in the plastic bag hangs from her teeth
sounds of soldiers searching the offices come from below her
up ahead she sees a point of light
with a gleeful grunt she shimmies faster shes nearly made it
a dozen soldiers and the chief of police have their eyes and guns trained on the tin ventilation duct above their heads
it is very very obvious not only that a person is crawling through it but exactly where that person is
the chief of police pointedly coughs to get her attention
a beat of silence
the tin gives way and she plummets
hitting the ground hard then springing to her feet and through some knee jerk primal instinct kicking a nearby soldier in the head
eleven rifles cock and aim at her
and thats how shes caught frozen in a kung fu stance plastic bag in her teeth
she locks eyes with the chief of police
lets the bag drop from her teeth
and opens her mouth to speak
the hubbub has died down considerably soldiers march away from the castle in formation
bloom stephen and the chink sit watching for some sign
three police cars sirens blazing drive down the length of the bridge
the chief of police
as the last one passes bloom sees the chief of police riding shotgun and penelope sitting with a soldier behind caged mesh in the back seat
his face falls
then penelope spots him points and says something
very suddenly the police car stops
the chief of police gets out
nods at our intrepid three
and opens the door for penelope
as she climbs out he motions for the passing soldiers to stand at attention and salute her
he kisses her hand
in czech it has been a privilege madame to behold even briefly such a strong beautiful flower
in czech thank you sir i will not soon forget your kindness
she blushes and smiles then does an unhurried victory strut back to bloom stephen and the chink
the police cars drive off
penelope pulls the book out from under her jacket and sets it on a bench
a moment of victorious silence
clapping her hands she does a little shuffle dance of joy
penelope contd sings were a band of smugglers hey la la la la la we smuggle by night drink by day smugglers ho ho ho
bloom and stephen sit among empty wine glasses
the chink approaches gives stephen a hand gesture
let her sleep
train doesnt leave till eight
that was real
yeah i know
bloom walks pensively through a green park
cat stevens miles from nowhere plays from a nearby radio
his eye catches something
a shiny red apple on a fruit sellers cart
he approaches it slowly face flushed breath shallow eyeing the elderly vendor with a thin semblance of nonchalance
he is going to steal that apple
deftly he passes lifting and pocketing it just as the vendor turns away
bloom has done it
his pale face tightens
and sees a five year old boy
giving him a stare of infinite judgement
bloom turns on his heel and runs hell for leather
the vendor shouts
the little boy chases him pointing and screaming
and bloom sprints apple in hand a joyful smile forming on his lips
stephen bails bloom out
yeah but it was part of an epiphany
the train thunders south towards greece
stephen pokes his head into penelopes car says goodnight
as soon as hes gone a foot dangles down outside the window and taps it
penelope pulls it open bloom shimmies in with two mini bottles of gin
he kisses her
bloom holds a sleeping penelope watching the sun stream through the window and slipping the green rubber band cash into her suitcase
a low horn blows and blooms face darkens
the good ship fidele breaks the waves blowing its horn
stephen stands on the deck
bloom joins him
he strolls off leaving bloom watching the horizon gloomily
our intrepid four sit around a small table except for the chink who lies on a deck chair in a bikini and chuck taylors sunning herself
were rendezvousing with senor riosos guys here on an isolated beach just south of the mexican port town tampico
a simple handoff
penelope and yeungling will stay with the car bloom and i will do the handing
you guys seem a little tense
well im not thrilled they set this in mexico
there could be legitimate reasons but mexicos and i dont want to simplistically vilify an entire country but mexicos a horrible place
so well be careful
the chink fires an automatic pistol eight times into the dead center of a target pinned to a palm tree
she re loads
the beach sprawling below them penelope and bloom meander
the hotel itself feels very old red ruinous stone
is this going to be more dangerous than i think tomorrow
you should sleep at the hotel tonight ill stay with stephen at the beach house
youll need sleep
on the distant beach following the faint rapport of gunfire a palm tree falls over
im really happy right now
right now i am
she kisses him and runs off along the cliff side singing the smuggler song
bloom contd penelope
but shes too far away now and the ocean is too loud
she cant hear him and he cant hear her and in another moment she has vanishes into the green brush and white flowers
behind blooms pained face the sun dips towards the beach
stephen packs for tomorrow bloom stares out the black window drinking
flower in his lapel
stephen picks up the con flowchart
the last box in our last con
let them begin the beguine
hows it feel
shes something special stephen
he stares at his drink
bloom contd can i just have a little more time
just a few days
i want to keep her like this i dont want this to just end
dont make me do this
be angry at me you son of a bitch
dont be pathetic
i told you not to fall for her im not gonna do this
stephen comes very close to blooms face looks him straight in the eye
finds his answer
i dont believe you
he goes back to packing
bloom stands the beach behind him the glowing lights of the hotel before him
bloom knocks on a door
penelope answers in her bathrobe
i know what ive gotta do
ive gotta talk to you
are you wearing shoes
he pulls her out of the room
bloom pulls penelope by the hand but she stops
my brother and i are con men
all things considered we might be the most respected con man team working today
and everything since you hit me with your lamborghini all of this its all fake
its all a con
the waves break angrily on the beach
in the distance stephen finishes his drink on the beach house porch goes inside and turns out the light
no we were going to blow you off tomorrow using the cackle bladder its a term we have actors playing the argentina guys men when we showed up the deal
would go bad they would open fire on us stephen and i would pretend to be shot using blood packets squibs
thats cackle bladder in the old days they put fake blood in chicken bladders so
so youd escape with the chink shed send you off with a little travelling money and that would be that
but thats not how this ones going to end
i love you now and i want to get you out of this
im going to do what i have to do to get you out of this away from all this for good
are you ready
bloom leads penelope down the beach by the hand
stephens gone into town to prep the argentina actors
your moneys at his place
i dont want the money lets just leave
for a moment hes tempted
the dark beach house looms ahead
bloom leads penelope in stumbles in the dark switches on a lamp
click click it doesnt come on
you have to switch it on at the base
stephen sits in an easy chair not looking happy
but not angry
much more sad than angry
so ive told her our whole play
and im here
to take her money back
hows that make you feel
this isnt the ending you wanted
it doesnt matter now
this is the way it ends
so lets get it over with
wheres the money
i ate it
give me the money stephen
i dont want the money
hes not going to keep a single piece of you
im sorry you fell in love with her
but shes a mark
and all of this all of it is a con
every moment you shared with her you were just playing the part of a man falling in love
thats what youre afraid of right
that you dont know the difference
or maybe that there is no difference
that thats what love is
to bloom no
youre too scared to leave
youre scared to ride off into a sunset that isnt painted tarpaulin cause real sunsets are beautiful but they turn into dark uncertain nights
if you were ready for that you wouldnt be here
the money is in my bedroom
right behind me
but in my story you dont get the money or the sunset or the girl
a long beat
the dark bedroom doorway looms behind stephen
lets just go
bloom lunges cracking stephen in the jaw
stephen goes down bloom leaps past him but stephen grabs blooms leg and brings him down
then they are fighting
penelope watches horrified
a frightening brutal brawl that tears the small beach house apart thirty years worth of a fight
until stephen throws bloom to the ground at penelopes feet
upsetting a small table
the chinks pistol lying on the holey paper target falls and strikes the ground
and goes off with a deafening rapport
blood spreads just beneath stephens collarbone
stephen stays standing for a moment shocked
a dribble of blood out of the corner of his mouth
he half grins
tastes like tin foil
and sinks to the ground
blooms eyes glaze
he crawls to his brother
takes him in his arms
penelope watches the brothers holding each other
tears in her eyes but she backs away a step very conscious of not being a part of this moment
bloom looks up at her almost taking a moment to recognize her
he doesnt move from his brother
penelope contd im sorry
for a long moment the brothers bloom lie in each others arms in the middle of the broken room
then bloom stands goes to the window and watches penelope walking off into the distance down the beach
from the darkened bedroom doorway steps the chink her face a mask
lifts his shirt and removes the squib and blood packets
bloom steps outside
a wood patio with steps leading down to the sand
bloom watches penelope now very distant almost gone
stephen comes out pulls out a flask
nothing i think that was the most honest conversation weve ever had
more nothing you actually connected on a few of those punches
did you expect me to do it
to come here tonight end it the way you wrote it
or were you really disappointed i didnt run off with her
i was disappointed
but i wasnt surprised
bloom turns and slugs him in the jaw
stephen falls to the sand
i let you do your monologue but you wanna know why i did it
i did it so shed never want to see me again
to get her away from all this for good
without looking back bloom walks off down the beach in the opposite direction of penelope leaving stephen bleeding in the sand alone in the dark uncertain night
title card months later
penelopes home bucolic on a lazy spring day
at a picnic table at the far edge of the front lawn penelope sits writing with intense concentration on a piece of paper
after awhile she raises her head regarding what shes written thoughtfully
folds it up puts it in her pocket
clicks the seemingly innocent ballpoint pen
the mansion explodes completely
she walks away without looking back
after a beat the plaster deer explodes in a ridiculous fireball
green hills surround the walled medieval city of ferentino
a tiny white car inches its way across the countryside and up into the city
bloom walks up the stone alley to his apartment a bag of groceries in hand
he spots the white car parked out front
loud shouting in italian grows louder until penelope and the grandmother burst out the front door
berating each other with italian curses and hand gestures
penelope sees bloom and freezes
the grandmother keeps up her barrage as she takes the groceries from bloom but as soon as shes behind penelopes back she gives bloom a wink points to her and
gives a thumbs up of approval
bloom and penelope wander the twisty alleyways of the city
how did you find me
how did you find the chink
she gave me her cell when we got to mexico
i didnt even know she had one
i think shes kind of selective in who she gives the number to
they sit with wine and bread
why are you here penelope
why did you decide to stay with your brother instead of coming with me in mexico
everything stephen said that night was true
ive been doing a lot of thinking the past three months
i want you to consider something
she takes a piece of paper from her pocket unfolds it and slides it across the table to him
on it written over and over in a dozen different stylized fonts is penelope the con artist
bloom sets the paper down with a snap
everything stephen said was true
i was just playing you as a mark
everything between us none of it was real
she leans in close to him her hand on his leg
i dont believe you
its obvious even before she kisses him that shes right
bloom dials a pay phone
hes been crying
in a private room a card table is overturned
stephen lies on the ground in a defensive posture a ravishing woman in red lunging at him with a curved dagger
a bearded man with an eyepatch holds her back by the wrists while a monocled man in an antique wheelchair holds his tear stained face in his hands
this whole scene is frozen like a tableau as stephens cell phone chirps away
annoyed the bearded man gives him a go ahead nod
stephen hastily answers it
how quickly can you get to ferentino
bloom fishes out his pocket watch
as hes putting his pocket watch back he finds the stack of green rubber band money in his breast pocket
penelope plays cards with the grandmother
stephen and bloom sit on the little landing outside the apartment
so she comes back wanting to work with us
i think wed be lucky to have her
if you called me to hear my opinion on the matter
which im getting the feeling you didnt
i did what i did in mexico to get her out of all this
i would rather die than bring her into the con
so maybe you want to tell me what im doing in ferentino
you knew shed come back
what did you figure she was good for another million
one point seven five
we will play her again one last con but not for money
im gonna tell you how this ones gonna end
you built us into this youre gonna fly us out end it so shes done with all of us
end it all so it cant start up again
you want me to plan a con whose sole purpose is to blow her off for good
i love her
you owe me this
i dont want to turn her into me
penelope sleeps on a cot against the window
bloom enters wearily
sits in a chair
in the next room over stephen sits in the dark
a lovely tune sung in mandarin chinese plays over this segueing us into
on a television screen images of the shanghai skyline
title card shanghai a wall of monitors which the chink steps in front of singing the climax of the song
beautiful and sad
as the song ends she sees through the spotlight penelope bloom and stephen at a table
the chinks face betrays just the slightest hint of disappointment
the four sit with drinks
so whats the next job
before we do the next job we need to liquidate our assets from the last job
but youve got your money from the last job well thats profit not capital the three of us have already split it up
so step one sell the book of hours
i thought it was fake
with all your random expertise we couldnt risk a flat out fake
it isnt worth two point five million we could maybe catch four hundred grand for it but its real
whod we buy it from
perfect well sell it right back to him
the chink hands him a piece of paper
stephen contd if he wasnt dead
well theres demarco or boyer
or roche if we want to go state side
with minskie out wed have to go deep black market if we wanted to be a hundred percent clear
theres only one place thats deep enough for that
bloom and the chink know exactly what hes talking about and they dont look happy
its like cancer i dont even like saying the word
bloom stephen and the chink drink in a cramped little concrete room adjacent to the bars kitchen
were obviously not going to deal with real russians
theyll be our guys in a phony set up theyll take our phony book and give her phony cash a closed loop
safe and simple
bloom looks to the chink for an opinion
gets a blank face
stephen contd so
we go to st
at the mention of st
petersburg bloom looks sharply at stephen but stephen presses on
stephen contd she does the hand off with our fake russians
but while were driving out of town everything goes bad
he lays a simple flowchart drawn on a napkin three boxes
he points to the first penelope sells book to russians stephen contd we discover we were sold a counterfeit book in the first place which weve now sold to russian
we discover this when the russian mob starts taking us out one by one
he points to the second box red dawn
stephen contd first they ambush our car destroying the money
then they take me out then the chink and finally you bloom in a heroic death that allows penelope to barely escape with her life
devastated but reborn with the knowledge that you loved her so much you died so she could live she drives off into a romantic life of adventure and peril on
the run from imaginary russians
he points to the third box the end
stephen contd what do you think
the blood red sun sets over the city
penelope snores on the bed while our intrepid three unpack
the phone rings
stephen answers it listens hangs up
our russians have arrived
stephen bloom and the chink ride down to the lobby with a red suitcase
whod you get anyway
to play the russians
the elevator doors open revealing the diamond dog
the dog leans against the bar with several lackeys waiting patiently making sparks with his gold lighter
sounds of shouting come from the adjoining dining area
i dont understand
tell me so i understand
three months ago you were ready to blind the old bastard we need someone who can pass for the russian mob to buy our fake book
the dogs got his big store right here in st
alright fuckin stop
you want this to finish in st
petersburg you want this to end with the dog for some what thematic something
fine but dont tell it like a story lets say it
twenty three years ago and i can still smell that blood red apartment of his the smell of that place
i hate him stephen but this isnt that this is i dont trust him
whats he gonna do
steal our fake money
beat ive thought this one out believe me
and we cant end it without him
its gonna be ok
the red leather suitcase on the bar
stephen still the grand architect with your symbols
red for temptation white for salvation
the dog opens it revealing us hundreds
examines it with a loupe
diamond dog contd impressive boys
theres visible cross hatching in franklins eye
sure enough obvious jagged misprints cut into ben franklins eye on the bills
ill be damned
closes case ruskies wouldnt be caught dead handing over a rag bag like this it should be a steel attache
well do the drop off at your store
make it scary think a movie version of the russian mafia but dont hassle her
the dog closes the case and for a moment blooms eyes rest on his bandaged hand
he then takes the case and quickly moves off with his crew
diamond dog contd i look forward to meeting the lady
take care boys
leaving his gold lighter on the bar
the chink leads stephen and bloom around the brown peugeot
our fake russian attack
one small charge will simulate a bullet hit and blow out the back window
the chink points with an extendable pointer to a small nub on the rear windshield
stephen contd so that one bang then we roll off the road
once we get clear of the car the chink sets off the final charge incinerating the car and the money in the trunk
thisll all happen exactly twenty seconds after we cross the main bridge out of town
after the bridge
stephen makes a note in a manila envelope tucks it in his jacket
bloom and the chink walk back to their rooms
the chink is expressionless
youve been awful quiet
she doesnt react
bloom contd im doing this for her
but a door clicks shut and bloom is alone in the hall
penelope in bed
her door cracks open and she sleepily looks up
bloom stands silhouetted in the doorway
tomorrow it all starts
she lifts the sheets
he gets into bed and as she drifts into peaceful slumber bloom is very conscious of holding her for the last time
when her snores begin he has ear plugs ready
the peugeot drives into the heart of the city
bloom stephen and the chink parked in an alley watching a doorway across the street with a pair of binoculars
bloom breathes uneasily checks his watch
she gives the dog the book he gives her the fake money
this is taking too long
just then penelope trots out
metal attache case in hand
on the outskirts of town parked beside a murky little lake
our heroes gather around the metal attache case on the hood
he hassled me
took forever looking the book over haggled the price
wanted to pay me in rubles
stephen smirks then opens it
the moneys there
lets get the hell out of russia
bloom pulls the dogs gold lighter from his pocket takes one last glance at st
petersburg and tosses it down into the lake
the brown peugeot drives towards the climbing sun
the chink drives stephen rides shotgun
bloom and penelope in the back seat
he looks weary
he sees the bridge approaching maybe a half mile ahead
she pulls his head down into her lap fingers in his hair
he breathes closes his eyes
an explosion shatters the front passenger window
blooms eyes snap open he bolts upright
the bridge is still a quarter mile away
in the next moment the car becomes a din of breaking glass screams tires screeching
a black mercedes roars out on to the road machine gun fire blazing from its windows literally shredding the peugeot
the car spins tires flapping and hits a highway embankment full speed launching into the air
a moment of strange silence as the car flips mid air
the brothers lock eyes for a split second
the car slams into the steep grassy embankment manages to flip upright and rolls into a thick forest coming to an abrupt stop against a stout tree
they all four dive out of the car bloom shoving penelope tumbling into the thick forest an instant before the car becomes a roiling ball of flame
bloom lies shell shocked his vision blurry
he vaguely sees penelope passed out beside him stephen on the other side of the car
a dark figure comes trotting into the woods shining a flashlight on the charred car
goes to stephen
reaches down to him
blooms mind flutters away into darkness
slumped against a tree
penelope hunches over him
are you alright
yeungling went to get another car
we dont know
he was gone
bloom stands shakily goes to the charred car
runs his fingers over the dozens of bullet holes
goes to where stephen fell
lying in the grass a manila envelope
penelope contd were going to find him
if he escaped hell contact us
if theyve got him its for ransom
whos got him
the chink pulls up in the green bug headlights catching blooms face against the dark forest depths
a desolate gas station parking lot
bloom sits in the bug loading his revolver with shaky fingers
penelope stands outside
stephen god please whats happening
i dont know what to do
i dont know stephen please
a long black sedan screeches to a halt in the parking lot outside the window bloom bolts out of the car pistol ready
but the chink climbs out of the black sedan
where does she get all these cars
bloom motions for penelope to stay back then goes to meet the chink in the middle of the parking lot
if you know whats happening now would be a really good time to speak up
she sets a suitcase down beside her
bloom takes this in
bloom contd no please
i need your help here now i dont know what to do
the slightest smile communicates all the compassion in the world
but shes leaving
she hands him a small slip of paper their fingers touching for an instant
she gives penelope a quick little call me gesture picks up her case and walks off
a truck blocking our view of her car pulls away and she gets in
bloom looks down at the slip of paper
a short phrase in chinese
bloom contd thanks
the engine turns over and the chinks car explodes in a dramatic fireball
the paper flutters out of bloomss fingers a moment before he and penelope are thrown to the pavement by the shock wave
bloom and penelope lift their heads absorbing what just happened
a busy street which a title card identifies as chicago illinois
on the corner an unassuming chinese restaurant
the chef on the phone
ah ah yes mr
he puts the phone down and goes to the fax machine which is spitting out a facsimile of the chinks slip of paper
bloom on a pay phone scribbling on a piece of paper
so ive got we are all assholes in our own theatrical enterprises
this phrase written on blooms paper
and then it end with goodbye shit head
but it is different meaning in mandarin uh endearing
shit head if you have affection for shit
the bug parked nearby
penelope sits on the curb crying
bloom sits next to her
what did it mean
i dont know
what did it say
were all of us marks in our own cons
and she said goodbye
i still cant believe it
that the chink fell for a car bomb
neither can i
oh oh god do you think she faked it
so the russians would think she was dead
bloom stands paces away
he leafs limply through the manila folder addresses pictures information
a paper with the dogs photo clipped to it
an address in st
the napkin stephen wrote the con flowchart on
the third box the end
penelope contd what do we do now
scrawled on the inside of the manila envelope an unwritten life
blooms face clears
he wipes his eyes
bloom goes to the bug
where are you going
this wasnt russians
this was done by an old mentor of ours who wants us off the map
he has an apartment in st
so this is yeah
ive gotta go back to that apartment to face the dog and get my brother back
thats how im gonna end this
penelopes eyes gleam
she jumps up to the passenger door and bloom stops her with a weary look
we can skip the whole you sending me nobly away and me refusing to leave your side thing
a narrow alley between tall apartments
bloom parks pulls his gun and checks it
if there are shots you run to the car and drive with or without me
a badly lit apartment hallway
bloom approaches a door penelope behind him
his breathing becomes hard
his face contorts
he crumples next to the door
whats in there
tell me who this guy is
blooms breathing steadies
hes just an old man
he tries the knob
blood red walls
dark neglected and to all appearances empty
bloom creeps down the darkened corridor gun outstretched
breathes through his nose chokes
i came back
he kicks open a door revealing a large living space
he lowers his gun switches on the light
sniffs the air
bloom almost laughs
is that what that smell is
a closet door smacks open revealing the business end of a double barrel shotgun
bloom spins gun drawn
then a moment of stillness
the shotgun barrel quivers
its held by the year old boy bloom saw in the dogs mercedes in prague
malnourished and scared
penelope approaches him slowly
in russian its okay
honey its alright
the shotgun sinks to the ground
penelope strokes his hair back from his face
bloom lowers the gun trembling
ask him if anyone else is here
ask him where the diamond dog is
in russian where is the diamond dog
in english the dog of diamonds is gone
bloom does a quick search of the rest of the room
as he does penelope asks the boy one more question in russian and gets a quick answer
get the car started
what about him
she believes him and goes
bloom kneels in front of the boy
bloom contd you dont need to be afraid of him anymore
or angry at him
or ever come back here again
he doesnt concern you anymore
its gonna be ok
the boy nods
bloom hands him the stack of bills wrapped in the green rubber band
the boy snatches it and runs off
bloom trots out of the apartment building and sees two things penelope working the vws starter and a black mercedes speeding down the narrow street towards her
he sprints towards her screaming get out
get out of the car
she sees the approaching merc too late and ducks down
a hand hurls something from the darkened window
it smashes through the bugs passenger side window showering penelope with glass
the mercedes roars off down the street
bloom reaches the bug and throws the door open
penelope lies covered in safety glass holding a russian nesting doll
the seven progressively smaller dolls lie open on the back seat bloom holds the two halves of the final tiny doll and penelope holds a note
its a ransom note
it says they have stephen it says they want the money wired to a specific account they give a bank to do it at and a manager to ask for
penelope contd then an address to come to at two p
in two hours
ill wire the money from my account and well go get stephen
its a lot
ill do it i want to ive got plenty how much are they asking for
one point seven five million
a cold pit opens in blooms stomach
no no no
he punches the dashboard
bloom contd no ill kill him
ill kill him if thats what this is if thats all that this is no no no
what are you talking about
theres another possibility that i should of im a fucking idiot
this might all be a con
by my brother
to get me oh god he wanted me to face the dog to end it and he gets your money
im going to be sick
would he do that
i dont know
yes of course he would
bloom contd to tell a story so well it becomes real
the perfect con
thats his whole goddammit thats what
but you dont know
lets transfer the money
you dont know
son of a bitch
you dont know
this is your brothers life
im gonna wire the money
bloom sits in the car alone
he punches the dashboard again helpless enraged and scared
penelope gets in looks at the address on the note
penelope and bloom sit in the car parked in front of the impressive facade of a closed burned out old theater
the clock on the dashboard reads
im so scared
anything i can imagine finding in there im scared of
im going to be here when you come out
she kisses him
he puts his hand on the door
walks up the stairs to the inky maw of the theater door
goes in alone
a genuinely creepy place
bloom steps lightly deeper into the theater
a few lights flicker on the walls fitfully illuminating the broken dusty seats and bare ruined stage
bloom walks down the aisle trying to keep his voice steady
a spotlight snaps on from the mezzanine right in blooms face
he spins trapped in its glare
a guttural command is shouted in what might be russian
when bloom doesnt respond the spot silently advances a few feet ahead of him towards the stage
bloom gingerly follows it up onto the splintered stage and finally resting on a split in the tarpaulin backdrop
with a wary glance back bloom steps through it
giant fossils of antique stage scenery
utility lights high above cut by scaffolding patch everything in dim jagged forms of light and black
come on out
lets blow this one hat town
then a harsh utility lamp snaps on cruelly lighting stephens face
shockingly bruised and battered old and new blood
bloom cries and rushes towards him
no bloom freeze
stephen is tied to a chair
a dark figure behind him holds the lamp with a black gloved hand
stephen who is it
is it the dog
did penelope wire the money
theyre calling to check right now
the dark figures cell phone rings he holds it to his ear for a moment then flips it closed
something happens in the blackness and stephen shakily stands cut loose
stephen contd stay where you are bloom
im coming to you
he takes a couple wobbly steps
behind him bloom sees the dark figure raising his gun towards stephens back pulling the hammer
and the utility lamp switches off
blooms revolver pops out of his sleeve and hes firing into the blackness
stephen drops flat to the ground
the fiery rapport of a big pistol flashes from the blackness strobing the scene like stage lightning
bloom reloads behind the cover of a heavy flat but stephen lies on his stomach out in the open
bloom contd stephen
but bloom makes a dash for his brother out into the open unloading three more rounds into the dark
the dark figure returns fire on bloom who is sprinting full on his feet in a large pool of light
a sitting duck
stephen launches himself up tackling bloom backwards
just before they fall behind the safety of the flat a red burst of blood flowers from stephens left lower back
bloom sets him down gently and hears heavy footsteps behind him
he turns firing but only sees a blur of dark coat go by through the torn backdrop
bloom runs out on stage tearing the tarpaulin and fires after the dark figure limping up the aisle and away into the lobby
bloom walks back to stephen who lies behind the flat breathing heavy
blood soaking through his shirt
please tell me this is all gonna be ok
tell me thats a squib and thats makeup and that you just gave me what i always wanted and pulled off the perfect con
a long long moment
stephen coughs spits
then a wry grin spreads across his face
you said it not me
he stands the shakiness gone
stephen contd can i get a wow for this one
you son of a bitch
bloom looks like he might hit him but his face breaks and he embraces him crying
the brothers bloom stay like that for a long while holding each other in the spotlights glow
finally stephen pulls away tears in his eyes
he wipes them wipes blood from his lip
tastes like tin foil
alright heres what i want you to do
the chink split
a hint of relief in stephens face
take penelope back to helsinki take that flight to rio
lay low like we said
play out the on the run from vengeful russians thing thatll be fun for her
play it like im dead actually thatll add some gravity to everything thatll be nice
and ill see you when i see you
i hope not
last thing you need is me hanging around
anyway how could i top this
bloom hugs him again
i love you
he turns to go
think of any card
stephen pulls out a pack of cards
stephen cuts to the queen of hearts
bloom contd stephen
grins thats the best card trick ive ever seen
i just wish you had a bigger audience
youre the only audience ive ever needed
stephen watches him go
rumbling towards finland
in the bug bloom sleeps in penelopes arm while she drives
she looks at his hand on hers his shirt cuff bright red with stephens blood
she strokes his shoulder sadly
off blooms sleeping face
stephen pulls a chair out onto the stage sets it right in the spotlights glare
trembling as if it takes all his last strength in the world
looks at the queen of hearts moves his fingers over it
then slides is up his sleeve
blood trickles down his hand
bloom wakes with a start
hey its ok
the bridge is coming up were almost at the border
were you dreaming about stephen
she strokes his hair back from his face
he nods and looks down at his sleeve
stephens blood on his white cuff
now a dark shade of brown
bloom looks at this shirt
all the blood its all brown
he looks up at the road nearly panicked
maybe a quarter mile ahead is the bridge
he bursts out of the car and run tumbles down the grassy hillside till he finds the car tracks
he follows them to the charred remains of the peugeot
penelope stumbles down after him
what is it
youre scaring me what did you ask the russian kid in the dogs apartment
he said the dog isnt here then what did you ask
bloom kicks open the trunk
pries open the blistered attache case
sifts through the charred pile of cinders that was the money from the russians till he finds what he was looking for and brings it out into the dying light
how long had he been alone
and what did he say
a scrap of unburned money
a fragment of ben franklins face
since yesterday morning
a single eye gazing up at him the green grass behind it
the eye is perfect
no cross hatching
bloom sinks to his knees
this is real
they hassled you
bloom the dog was gone before we got there
they hadnt cleared out of their apartment they had been cleared out
russians in black overcoats burst in shooting the dogs men with silenced pistols
the boy shuts himself in the closet terrified
took his store
they didnt know about his deal with us but you haggled with them
you really sold the book to real russians
the diamond dog was gone
the scene beside the lake our four heroes checking the money in the attache case
lets get the hell out of russia
bloom tosses the gold lighter it splashes into the lake
we follow it plunging beneath the surface
deep deep down among weak tendrils of light the diamond dog sinks into watery blackness a long blade in his neck
and they came after us
penelope holds him tight
stephen saved my life
bloom folds into penelopes arms but she doesnt let him
she holds his crying face up
and he did it so you could live
your brother loved you
he loved you so much
look at me
stephen said something once i got the feeling hed rather be telling it to you
he said theres no such thing as an unwritten life
just badly written ones
i love you
penelope contd were gonna outrun these bastard russian mafia and were gonna hide out in rio then were gonna live like were telling the best fucking story in the world
are you ready
she holds his face close to hers for a long beat
then smiles and pushes away launching up the grassy hill
bloom watches her
time slows as she turns back towards him still running and holds out her hand for him to follow
i was thinking of something stephen said too
the perfect con is one where everyone involved gets just the thing they wanted
he takes the girls hand and runs with her towards the point of light breaking over the hill
sunset with her wine red fingers falls over the road ahead
the rumbly old vw chugs away from us towards the horizon
