screenplay by emma thompson based on the novel by jane austen a series of traveling shots
a well dressed pompous looking individual john dashwood is making an urgent journey on horseback
he looks anxious
norland park a large country house built in the early part of the eighteenth century lies in the moonlit parkland
in the dim light shed by candles we see a bed in which a man mr dashwood lies his skin waxy his breathing laboured
around him two silhouettes move and murmur their clothing susurrating in the deathly hush
a woman mrs dashwood sits by his side holding his hand her eyes never leaving his face
urgent is john not yet arrived
we expect him at any moment dearest
mr dashwood looks anguished
the girls i have left so little
shh hush henry
elinor will try to look after you all but make sure she finds a good husband
the men are such noodles hereabouts little wonder none has pleased her
they smile at each other
mrs dashwood is just managing to conceal her fear and grief but marianne is sure to find her storybook hero
a romantic poet with flashing eyes and empty pockets
as long as she loves him whoever he is
margaret will go to sea and become a pirate so we need not concern ourselves with her
mrs dashwood tries to laugh but it emerges as a sob
an older manservant thomas now enters anxiety written on every feature
your son is arrived from london sir
mr dashwood squeezes his wifes hand
let me speak to john alone
she nods quickly and he smiles at her with infinite tenderness
ah my dear
how happy you have made me
mrs dashwood makes a superhuman effort and smiles back
she allows thomas to help her out
she passes john dashwood as he enters presses his hand but cannot speak
john takes her place by the bed
mr dashwood summons his last ounces of energy and starts to whisper with desperate intensity
john you will find out soon enough from my will that the estate of norland was left to me in such a way as prevents me from dividing it between
he cannot quite take it in
calm yourself father
this is not good for you
but mr dashwood continues with even greater determination
norland in its entirety is therefore yours by law and i am happy for you and fanny
john looks torn between genuine distress and unexpected delight
but your stepmother my wife and daughters are left with only five hundred pounds a year barely enough to live on and nothing for the girls dowries
you must help them
johns face is a picture of conflicting emotions
behind them is the ominous rustling of parchments
of course you must promise to do this
a brief moment of sincerity overcomes johns natural hypocrisy
i promise father i promise
mr dashwood seems relieved
suddenly his breathing changes
john looks alarmed
he rises and we hear him going to find the doctor
but it is we who share the dying mans last words
outside the house sits a very well to do carriage
behind it waits another open carriage upon which servants are laying trunks and boxes
john is standing in mourning clothes and a traveling cape
he is watching and obviously waiting for a pert woman fanny dashwood who is standing by a mirror looking at him keenly
what do you mean help them
dearest i mean to give them three thousand pounds
fanny goes very still
john gets nervous
the interest will provide them with a little extra income
such a gift will certainly discharge my promise to my father
fanny slowly turns back to the mirror
oh without question
more than amply
one had rather on such occasions do too much than too little
a pause as fanny turns and looks at him again
of course he did not stipulate a particular sum
a red eyed maid betsy plunges a beautiful muslin frock into a vat of black dye
mrs dashwood is rushing about mourning ribbons flapping putting her knick knacks into a small valise
the room is in chaos
a young woman elinor dashwood looks on helplessly
to be reduced to the condition of visitor in my own home
it is not to be borne elinor
we have nowhere to go
john and fanny will descend from london at any moment followed no doubt by cartloads of relatives ready to turn us out of our rooms one by one do you
expect me to be here to welcome them
she suddenly collapses into a chair and bursts into tears
i shall start making inquiries for a new house at once
until then we must try to bear their coming
john and fanny are on their way out of london
fifteen hundred then
what say you to fifteen hundred
what brother on earth would do half so much for his real sisters let alone half blood
they can hardly expect more
there is no knowing what they expect
the question is what can you afford
a beautiful young woman marianne dashwood is sitting at the piano playing a particularly sad piece
marianne cannot you play something else
mamma has been weeping since breakfast
marianne stops turns the pages of her music book and starts playing something equally lugubrious
i meant something less mournful dearest
john and fanny are waiting as the ostlers make the final adjustments to their carriage
the landlord hovers waiting for a tip
a hundred pounds a year to their mother while she lives
would that be more advisable
it is better than parting with the fifteen hundred all at once
he displays some coins in his hand
fanny removes one and nods
but if she should live longer than fifteen years we would be completely taken in
people always live forever when there is an annuity to be paid them
john gives the coins to the landlord
elinor comes to the foot of a large tree from which a small staircase issues
margaret are you there
please come down
john and fanny will be here soon
elinor is about to leave when a disembodied and truculent young voice stops her
why are they coming to live at norland
they already have a house in london
because houses go from father to son dearest not from father to daughter
it is the law
elinor tries another tack
if you come inside we could play with your atlas
its not my atlas any more
its their atlas
close on elinor as she ponders the truth of this statement
john and fanny joggle on
twenty pounds now and then will amply discharge my promise you are quite right
although to say the truth i am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them money
they will have five hundred a year amongst them as it is and what on earth can four women want for more than that
their housekeeping will be nothing at all they will have no carriage no horses hardly any servants and will keep no company
only conceive how comfortable they will be
the large contingent of servants who staff norland park are gathered in gloomy silence as elinor addresses them
as you know we are looking for a new home
when we leave we shall be able to retain only thomas and betsy
cam holds on thomas and betsy a capable woman
we are very sorry to have to leave you all
but we are certain you will find the new mrs dashwood a fair and generous mistress
john and fannys carriage approaches norland
they will be much more able to give you something
john and fanny are about to get out
so we are agreed
no money but the occasional gift of game and fish in season will be very welcome
your father would be proud of you
the entire family with the exception of margaret is present
betsy is serving food in an atmosphere of stiff silence
john chews loudly
marianne is rigid with resentment
mrs dashwood maintains a cool removed dignity
elinor tries to play hostess
how is mrs ferrars
my mother is always in excellent health thank you
my brother robert is in town with her this season and quite the most popular bachelor in london
he has his own barouche
in the brief silence which follows this fanny surreptitiously checks the hallmark on her butterknife
you have two brothers have you not
edward is the eldest mamma quite depends upon him
he is traveling up from plymouth shortly and will break his journey here
mrs dashwood looks at elinor pointedly
to mrs dashwood if that is agreeable to you of course
my dear john this is your home now
fanny looks about barely able to conceal her satisfaction
elinor is sitting with a little pile of parcels
she puts a shawl into some paper and ties it with ribbon as marianne thunders in looking mutinous
fanny wishes to know where the key for the silver cabinet is kept
betsy has it i think
what does fanny want with the silver
i can only presume she wants to count it
what are you doing
presents for the servants
have you seen margaret
i am worried about her
she has taken to hiding in the oddest places
at least she can escape fanny which is more than any of us is able
you do your best
you have not said a word to her for a week
truculently i have
i have said yes and no
fanny mrs dashwood elinor and john are at breakfast
elinor catches her eye and indicates fanny with a slight motion of her head
marianne makes a face
very polite good morning fanny
fanny is rather startled
good morning marianne
elinor is relieved
to fanny how did you find the silver
is it all genuine
elinor rushes in before marianne gets any further
pray when may we expect the pleasure of your brothers company
edward is due tomorrow
and my dear mrs dashwood in view of the fact that he will not be with us for long i wondered if miss margaret would mind giving up her room
to him the view is quite incomparable from her windows and i should so much like edward to see norland at its best
marianne slams her cup down and throws a furious look at elinor and marianne are removing margarets toys
there is but one consolation if edward is anything like fanny we shall be only too happy to leave
a very capable horseman edward ferrars canters up the gravel drive
close on his face as he gazes up at the elegant facade
everyone except margaret is present
edward has just shaken bands with elinor
he behaves with great respect to the dashwoods and seems embarrassed by fannys pro prietorial air
but where is miss margaret
i declare mrs dashwood i am beginning to doubt of her existence
she must run positively wild
forgive us mr ferrars
my youngest is not to be found this morning
she is a little shy of strangers at present
i am also shy of strangers and i have nothing like her excuse
dangerous how do you like your view mr ferrars
elinor glances at her warningly but edward replies with careful consideration
your stables are very handsome and beautifully kept mrs dashwood
edward your windows overlook the lake
an oversight fanny led me to the wrong room
i have rectified the situation and am happily settled in the guest quarters
marianne and elinor look at each other in surprise
fanny looks furious
mrs dashwood smiles warmly at edward
close on elinor
she is impressed
fanny is walking with edward who looks at the pictures with interest
they are all exceedingly spoilt i find
miss margaret spends all her time up trees and under furniture and i have barely had a civil word from marianne
my dear fanny they have just lost their father their lives will never be the same again
that is no excuse
fanny leads edward in
she sniffs with distaste
i have never liked the smell of books
the dust perhaps
as they speak edward notices a large atlas retreating apparently all by itself across the floor
someone is obviously under the table pulling it out of sight
he registers it and immediately moves in such a way as to shield it from fanny
he turns back searching for something to divert her
i hear you have great plans for the walnut grove
i shall have it pulled down to make room for a grecian temple
there is a stifled wail from under the table which edward covers with a cough
will you show me the site
and he ushers fanny out flicking a quick glance over his shoulder at the fugitives foot
elinor mrs dashwood and marianne are sitting round a table with a pile of letters
elinor is handing one back to her mother
we do not need four bedrooms we can share
this one then
elinor reads the letter quickly
marianne we have only five hundred pounds a year
i will send out more inquiries today
there is a knock on the door
hesitantly edward appears
pardon my intrusion but i believe i have found what you are looking for
marianne and mrs dashwood are puzzled by his elliptical manner but elinor immediately understands and rises in smiling relief
edward is standing outside keeping a discreet lookout
the door is half open and he can hear elinor trying to coax margaret out
fanny walks by with a butler to whom she is giving instructions
edward pretends to examine the mouldings and she passes on unsuspecting
wont you come out dearest
we havent seen you all day
mamma is very concerned
edward thinks hard
he makes a decision
edward walks in loudly
oh miss dashwood
excuse me i was wondering do you by any chance have such a thing as a reliable atlas
elinor looks up at him in astonishment
i believe so
i wish to check the position of the nile
edward appears to be utterly sincere
my sister says it is in south america
from under the table we hear a snort
elinor looks at him in realisation
no no indeed
she is quite wrong
for i believe it is in in belgium
you must be thinking of the volga
from under the table the volga
the volga which as you know starts in
vladivostok and ends in
where the coffee beans come from
they are having such a good time that it is rather a pity the game is stopped by the appearance from under the table of margaret who reveals herself to
be a disheveled girl of eleven
she hauls the atlas up and plonks it in front of the source of the nile is in abyssinia
how do you do
edward shakes margarets hand solemnly and looks over her head at elinor
they smile at each other a connection made
john is reading a newspaper
mrs dashwood sits across from fanny who thumbs through a fashion plate magazine
elinor is at a desk by the window writing a letter we see the words of course we should like to leave as soon as possible
suddenly she hears a commotion outside
margaret runs past the window brandishing a stick
edward follows and proceeds to teach her the first principles of sword fighting
they feint and parry edward serious and without a hint of condescension margaret concentrating furiously
edward suddenly turns as though feeling elinors gaze
she smiles but looks away quickly
edward comes into the doorway and sees elinor who is listening to marianne playing a concerto
elinor stands in a graceful rather sad attitude her back to us
suddenly she senses edward behind her and turns
he is about to turn away embarrassed to have been caught admiring her when he sees she has been weeping
hastily she tries to dry her eyes
he comes forward and offers her a handkerchief which she takes with a grateful smile
we notice his monogram in the corner apologetic that was my fathers favourite
edward nods kindly
thank you so much for your help with margaret mr ferrars
she is a changed girl since your arrival
not at all
i enjoy her company
has she shown you her tree house
would you do me the honour miss dashwood
it is very fine out
they start to walk out of shot still talking
margaret has always wanted to travel
she is heading an expedition to china shortly
i am to go as her servant but only on the understanding that i will be very badly treated
what will your duties be
sword fighting administering rum and swabbing
cam tilts up to find mrs dashwood on the middle landing of the staircase smiling down at them
cam tilts up yet further to find fanny on the landing above watching edward and elinor with a face like a prune
edward and elinor are still talking as they walk arm in arm in the late afternoon sun
all i want all i have ever wanted is the quiet of a private life but my mother is determined to see me distinguished
she hardly knows
any fine figure will suit a great orator a leading politician even a barrister would serve but only on the condition that i drive my own barouche and dine in
the first circles
his tone is light but there is an underlying bitterness to it
and what do you wish for
i always preferred the church but that is not smart enough for my mother she prefers the army but that is a great deal too smart for me
would you stay in london
i hate london
a country living is my ideal a small parish where i might do some good keep chickens and give very short sermons
edward and elinor are on horseback
the atmosphere is intimate the quality of the conversation rooted now in their affections
you talk of feeling idle and useless imagine how that is compounded when one has no choice and no hope whatsoever of any occupation
edward nods and smiles at the irony of it
our circumstances are therefore precisely the same
except that you will inherit your fortune
he looks at her slightly shocked but enjoying her boldness
we cannot even earn ours
perhaps margaret is right
piracy is our only option
they ride on in silence for a moment
what is swabbing exactly
dinner is over
john and fanny are examining plans of the norland estate looking for somewhere to build a hermitage
edward is reading out loud
elinor embroiders and listens
mrs dashwood and marianne make up the rest of the audience the latter in a state of high impatience
no voice divine the storm allayed no light propitious shone when snatched from all effectual aid we perished each alone but i beneath a rougher sea and whelmed in deeper
gulfs than he
marianne jumps up and goes to him
she takes the book from him and reads the stanza with passionate brio
can you not feel his despair
rather mortified edward starts again but not before receiving a sympathetic look from elinor which seems to comfort him a little
mrs dashwood is ruminating sadly
marianne rushes in holding a letter
this has just arrived
reading from the letter i should be pleased to offer you a home at barton cottage as soon as ever you have need of it why it is from my
cousin sir john middleton
even elinor must approve the rent
mrs dashwood looks at the letter again and thinks
has elinor not yet seen this
no i will fetch her
let us delay
i think i believe that edward and elinor have formed an attachment
marianne nods a little reluctantly
it would be cruel to take her away so soon and devonshire is so far
mrs dashwood makes her decision
she takes the letter and hides it in the pocket of her gown
marianne looks on frowningly
why so grave
do you disapprove her choice
by no means
edward is very amiable
but there is something wanting
he is too sedate his reading last night
elinor has not your feelings his reserve suits her
marianne thinks for a little
can he love her
can the ardour of the soul really be satisfied with such polite concealed affections
to love is to burn to be on fire all made of passion of adoration of sacrifice
like juliet or guinevere or heloise
they made rather pathetic ends dear
to die for love
how can you say so
what could be more glorious
i think that may be taking your romantic sensibilities a little far
the more i know of the world the more i am convinced that i shall never see a man whom i can truly love
you require so much
i do not
i require only what any young woman of taste should a man who sings well dances admirably rides bravely reads with passion and whose tastes agree in every point with
elinor is in bed deep in thought
marianne enters in her nightclothes carrying a book of poetry
she reads teasingly
is love a fancy or a feeling
no it is immortal as immaculate truth tis not a blossom shed as soon as youth drops from the stem of life for it will grow in barren regions where
no waters flow nor ray of promise cheats the pensive gloom she jumps onto the bed
elinor smiles somewhat suspiciously
what a pity it is that edward has no passion for reading
it was you who asked him to read and then you made him nervous
but your behaviour to him in all other respects is perfectly cordial so i must assume that you like him in spite of his deficiencies
trying hard i think him everything that is amiable and worthy
but he shall have my unanswering devotion when you tell me he is to be my brother
elinor is greatly taken aback and does not know how to reply
suddenly marianne hugs her passionately
how shall i do without you
do without me
marianne pulls away her eyes full of tears
i am sure you will be very happy
but you must promise not to live too far away
marianne there is no question of that is there is no under standing between
elinor trails off
marianne looks at her keenly
do you love him
the bold clarity of this question discomforts elinor
i do not attempt to deny that i think very highly of him that i greatly esteem that i like him
use those insipid words again and i shall leave the room this instant
this makes elinor laugh in spite of her discomfort
believe my feelings to be stronger than i have declared but further than that you must not believe
marianne is flummoxed but she rallies swiftly and picks up her book again
is love a fancy or a feeling
or a ferrars
go to bed
elinor blushes in good earnest
marianne goes to the door
imitating elinor i do not attempt to deny that i think highly of him greatly esteem him
and she is gone leaving elinor both agitated and amused
fanny is standing by the window looking out
we see her pov of elinor and edward walking in the garden
mrs dashwood enters pauses for a moment and then joins fanny at the window
fanny pretends not to have been watching but mrs dashwood looks down at the lovers and then smiles sweetly at her
we are all so happy that you chose to invite edward to norland
he is a dear boy and we are all very fond of him
fanny does a bit of quick thinking
we have great hopes for him
much is expected of him by our mother with regard to his profession naturally
and in marriage
she is determined that both he and robert will marry well
but i hope she desires them to marry for love first and foremost
i have always felt that contrary to common wisdom true affection is by far the most valuable dowry
love is all very well but unfortunately we cannot always rely on the heart to lead us in the most suitable directions
fanny lowers her voice confidingly
you see my dear mrs dashwood edward is entirely the kind of compassionate person upon whom penniless women can prey and having entered into any kind of understanding he would
never go back on his word
he is quite simply incapable of doing so
but it would lead to his ruin
i worry for him so mrs dashwood
my mother has always made it perfectly plain that she will withdraw all financial support from edward should he choose to plant his affections in less
exalted ground than he deserves
it is impossible for mrs dashwood not to get the point
she is appalled and furious
i understand you perfectly
she sweeps off
mrs dashwood breathless with rage is searching through her wardrobe for the gown which contains sir johns letter
frocks fly hither and thither
finally mrs dashwood plunges her hand into the right pocket and withdraws the letter
she looks at it suddenly concerned and anxious
the entire family is present
everyone is watching mrs dashwood who has just made her announcement
he is devastated
fanny is thrilled
mrs dashwood looks at him with compassion and then at elinor who is trying to keep calm
my cousin sir john middleton has offered us a small house on his estate
sir john middleton
what is his situation
he must be a man of property
he is a widower
he lives with his mother in law at barton park and it is barton cottage that he offers us
oh a cottage
a little cottage is always very snug
but you will not leave before the summer
oh my dear edward we can no longer trespass upon your sisters good will
we must leave as soon as possible
you will come and stay with us edward
i should like that very much
edward has long been expected in town by our mother
mrs dashwood ignores fanny
come as soon as you can edward
remember that you are always welcome
elinor has come to say goodbye to her horse
she strokes the soft face sadly
then she senses someone and turns to find edward standing nearby
cannot you take him with you
we cannot possibly afford him
perhaps he could make himself useful in the kitchen
elinor tries to smile
edward looks at her for a long moment and then comes closer
miss dashwood elinor
i must talk to you
the use of her christian name and in such a loving tone stops elinors breath altogether
there is something of great importance i need
to tell you he comes closer still
the horse breathes between them
elinor is on fire with anticipation but edward looks troubled and has less the air of a suitor than he might
about about my education
after a beat your education
it was less
successful than it might have been
edward laughs nervously
elinor is completely bewildered
it was conducted in plymouth oddly enough
do you know it
oh well i spent four years there at a school run by a a mr pratt pratt
elinor is beginning to feel like a parrot
precisely mr pratt and there i that is to say he has a as edward flounders a familiar voice cuts through this unexpected foray into his academic past
they turn to find fanny powering down upon them waving a letter
edward steps back glancing almost guiltily at elinor who is as confused as we are
i have been all over for you
you are needed in london this instant
fanny i am leaving this afternoon as it is no no that will not do
family affairs are in chaos owing to your absence
mother is quite adamant that you should leave at once
fanny is determined
she obviously has no intention of leaving him alone with elinor
edward turns to elinor frustration in every muscle his jaw set tight
excuse me miss dashwood
fanny drags edward off leaving elinor to gaze sadly after them
the dashwoods are on their way
the mood is very sombre
edward promised he would bring the atlas to barton for me
marianne looks at elinor pleased
well i will wager he will do so in less than a fortnight
mrs dashwood looks at elinor with satisfaction
the carriage rolls on
are we there yet
in comparison to norland barton cottage has the air of a damp shoebox
it sits low and bleak in the grey lonely countryside
from one side we can see the dashwoods carriage drawing up at the gate
from the other a much grander vehicle from which loud whooping can be heard is approaching
as the exhausted dashwoods alight they converge with a ruddy complexioned man in a redingote sir john middleton and a rotund equally roseate lady mrs jennings who have fallen over
each other in their haste to get out of their carriage
sir john clasps her hands and starts to help her up the path followed by elinor marianne and margaret who is clearly fascinated by his bouncy companion
dear ladies dear ladies upon my word here you are here you are here you are
sir john your extraordinary kindness oh none of that hush please none of that but here is my dear mamma in law mrs jennings
was the journey tolerable you poor souls
why did you not come up to the park first and take your ease
we saw you pass like many people who live rather lonely lives together
sir john and mrs jennings talk incessantly interrupt each other all the time and never listen
but i would not wait for you to come to us i made john call for the carriage she would not wait you know
as we get so little company
they reach the front door and betsys smiling welcome
in the confusion of milling people and thomas carrying the lighter luggage marianne contrives to slip into the house alone
we follow her but hear the conversation continuing in v
marianne looks about the parlour where a dismal fire is smoking
she starts up the stairs expressionless
but i feel as if i know you already delightful creatures
and you know you are to dine at barton park every day
oh but dear sir john we cannot oh no no no no no no no i shall not brook refusals
i am quite deaf to em you know deaf marianne enters a small bedroom
she sits on the bed
then she goes to the window and opens it
voices float up
but i insist
let us only settle in for a few days sir john and thank you oh no thankings no please cant bear em embarrassing you know marianne closes the window and
crosses the corridor to another bed room similarly stark
she sighs and turns back down the stairs
we will send game and fruit as a matter of course fruit and game and the carriage is at your beck and call marianne joins the group who are now
in the parlour
call and here is miss marianne
where did you disappear to
i declare you are the loveliest girl i ever set eyes on
cannot you get them married mrs dashwood
you must not leave it too long
but alas there are no smart young men hereabouts to woo them not a beau for miles
the strain of exhibiting joy and gratitude is beginning to tell on mrs dashwood who is sagging visibly
come mother let us leave them in peace
but there is colonel brandon
sir john is dragging her down the path
we served in the east india regiment together
just wait till he sees you
if we can persuade him out to meet you
but you are fatigued
i can see that you are fatigued
now he is pushing her into the carriage
of course she is fatigued
come along mother we really must leave them to themselves
you must get your maidservant to make you up some camphor it is the best tonic for the staggers
send thomas to us for the carriage when you are ready
they take off waving wildly
margaret goes down the path to watch them and turns back to her slightly stunned family
i like them
weakly what generosity
i am surprised they did not offer us their clothing
marianne and elinor are getting undressed for bed
its very cold
they keep their underclothing on and get in shivering at the bony chill of the linen
betsy is pinning out laundry
margaret tries to climb an impossible tree
her petticoats snag and tear
marianne looks out of the window at the wild countryside
uncon sciously one hand plays up and down on the sill as though it were a keyboard
elinor sits at a little desk counting money and making notes
betsy enters to clean out the fire
she notices the money
sugar is five shilling a pound these parts miss dashwood
lightly no more sugar then
close on mrs dashwood looking out of the window thinking
she remembers mrs jenningss words not a beau for miles
mrs dashwood turns into the room to look at her brood
elinor and marianne are mending margarets petticoats
close on the mothers anxious expression what is to become of them
establishing shot of sir johns house a very comfortable looking country seat with fine grounds
where can brandon be poor fellow
i hope he has not lamed his horse
close on an empty chair and place setting
pull out to reveal the dashwoods at their first dinner with sir john and mrs colonel brandon is the most eligible bachelor in the county he is bound to do
for one of you
mind he is a better age for miss dashwood but i dare say she left her heart behind in sussex eh
marianne flashes an unmistakable glance of alarmed concern at her sister which mrs jennings notices
i see you miss marianne
i think i have unearthed a secret
have you sniffed one out already mother
you are worse than my best pointer flossie
they both laugh immoderately
elinor tries to stay calm
what sort of man is he miss dashwood
is he butcher baker candlestick maker
i shall winkle it out of you somehow you know
shes horribly good at winkling
you are in lonely country now miss dashwood none of us has any secrets here or if we do we do not keep them for long
elinor tries to smile
marianne looks furious
margaret is staring at mrs jennings as if she were some particularly thrilling form of wildlife
he is curate of the parish i dare say
or a handsome lieutenant
give us a clue miss dashwood is he in uniform
elinor starts to change the subject but margaret interrupts her
he has no profession
sir john and mrs jennings turn on her with screams of delight
elinor marianne and mrs dashwood look at each other helplessly
a gentleman then
with daggers margaret you know perfectly well there is no such person
and his name begins with an f
elinor looks hard at her plate
mrs dashwood is appalled at her youngests relish for such a vulgar game
sir john and mrs jennings are cock a hoop
a very promising letter
let me f f fo fa
upon my word but i cannot think of a single name beginning with f forrest
marianne suddenly stands up
sir john and mrs jennings are so surprised they stop talking
everyone stares at marianne
controlled fury sir john might i play your pianoforte
of course yes my goodness
we do not stand on ceremony here my dear
for once elinor is grateful for her sisters rudeness as everyone rises and follows marianne out
a soldierly man of about forty colonel brandon is dismounting from his horse
from within we hear mariannes song begin
his head snaps up to the windows
an expression of pained surprise comes into his melancholy brooding eyes
everyone watches marianne as she plays and sings
behind them we see brandon entering
but he stays in the shadow of the door and no one notices him
close on his face
he gazes at marianne with an unfathomable look of grief and longing
he breathes in deeply
suddenly elinor feels his presence and looks around at him
after a few moments she turns back slightly puzzled
the song finishes
the man ventures out into the light and sir john springs from his seat
where have you been
come come and meet our beautiful new neighbours
what a pity you are late colonel
you have missed the most delightful singing
brandon bows to the company and smiles slightly
a great pity indeed
elinor looks at him even more puzzled
mrs dashwood may i present my dear friend colonel brandon
we served together in the east indies and i assure you there is no better fellow on earth have you really been to the east indies colonel
what is it like
margaret is quivering with fascination
but colonel brandon knows what margaret wants to hear
mysteriously the air is full of spices
margaret smiles with satisfaction
come miss dashwood it is your turn to entertain us
oh no sir john i do not and i think we can all guess what key you will sing in
sir john and mrs jennings are bursting with their new joke
they fall about
the dashwoods are returning home
a row is in progress
to margaret as for you you have no right no right at all to parade your ignorant assumptions they are not assumptions
you told me
elinor stares at marianne
marianne colours and attacks margaret again
i told you nothing theyll meet him when he comes anyway
that is not the point
you do not speak of such things before strangers but everyone else was mrs jennings is not everyone
i like her
she talks about things
we never talk about things
hush please now that is enough margaret
if you cannot think of anything appropriate to say you will please restrict your remarks to the weather
a heated pause
i like colonel brandon too
hes been to places
in the background sir john elinor and mrs jennings pack the remains of a picnic into a basket
mrs dashwood and margaret examine a foxhole
in the foreground marianne is cutting bulrushes for basketwork
her knife is blunt and she saws impatiently
colonel brandon materialises at her side and wordlessly offers her his hunting knife
oddly nervous marianne takes it
she turns back to the rushes and cuts them with ease
the colonels gaze follows her movements as if held by a magnet
sir john and brandon are cleaning their guns in companionable silence a habit left over from army days
sir john eyes brandon roguishly
you know what theyre saying of course
the word is that you have developed a taste for certain company
brandon stays resolutely silent
sir john is emboldened
and why not say i
a man like you in his prime shed be a most fortunate young lady brandon cuts across him
marianne dashwood would no more think of me than she would of you john
brandon my boy do not think of yourself so meanly and all the better for her
sir john subsides
brandon is clearly as angry with himself as he is with sir john
brandon strides along in hunting gear a gun slung under one arm his dog trotting behind him with a duck clamped between its jaws
the bulrushes catch his eye and he slows then stops
he stands for a moment deep in thought
then he takes his hunting knife cuts one and walks off contemplatively
an outdoor luncheon is in progress
colonel brandon is talking to mrs dashwood
occasionally he looks over towards marianne who is playing bilboquet with sir john and margaret
mrs jennings nudges elinor hard and gestures to brandon
stage whisper besotted
excellent match for he is rich and she is handsome
how long have you known the colonel
oh lord bless you as long as ever i have been here and i came fifteen years back
his estate at delaford is but four miles hence and he and john are very thick
he has no wife or children of his own for mrs jennings lowers her voice to a stentorian whisper
he has a tragic history
he loved a girl once twenty years ago now a ward to his family but they were not permitted to marry
elinor is intrigued
on what grounds
eliza was poor
when the father discovered their amour she was flung out of the house and he packed off into the army
i believe he would have done himself a harm if not for john
what became of the lady
oh she was passed from man to man disappeared from all good society
when brandon got back from india he searched for heaven knows how long only to find her dying in a poor house
you have seen how it has affected him
once i thought my daughter charlotte might have cheered him up but she is much better off where she is
elinor is silent with amazement at this unexpected history
look at him now though
i shall try an experiment on him
oh no please dear mrs jennings leave the poor colonel alone
no no it is just the thing all suitors need a little help my dear mrs jennings winks at elinor and rubs her hands as though about to perform a
trillingly colonel brandon
brandon looks up
we have not heard you play for us of late
for the simple reason that you have a far superior musician here
he indicates marianne who smiles absently
perhaps you did not know miss marianne that our dear brandon shares your passion for music and plays the piano forte very well
marianne looks at brandon in some surprise
play us a duet
brandon looks at mrs jennings warningly but she ignores him
ill trow you know quite as many melancholy tunes as miss marianne
her tone is so knowing that marianne frowns uncomfortably
let us see you both side by side
marianne rises impatiently
i do not know any duets
forgive me colonel
she moves away
mrs jennings chuckles
the dashwoods returning
marianne is taking her bonnet off so furiously that she simply gets the knot tighter and tighter
despite them selves elinor and mrs dashwood are amused
are we never to have a moments peace
the rent here may be low but i think we have it on very hard terms
mrs jennings is a wealthy woman with a married daughter she has nothing to do but marry off everyone elses
betsy pokes her head out from the dining room
theres a parcel arrived for you miss dashwood
they all crowd into the dining room to find a large package on the table which margaret is permitted to open
in the meantime elinor comes to the rescue with the bonnet and marianne stands shifting like a spirited mare as elinor patiently unravels the knot
it is too ridiculous
when is a man to be safe from such wit if age and infirmity do not protect him
if colonel brandon is infirm then i am at deaths door
it is a miracle your life has extended this far
did you not hear him complain of a rheumatism in his shoulder
a slight ache i believe was his phrase
marianne smiles and elinor laughs at her
then margaret opens the parcel to reveal her atlas
the atmosphere alters immediately as mrs dashwood and marianne look at elinor in consternation
but edward said he would bring it himself
there is a letter on top of the atlas
close on the address to the dashwoods
mrs dashwood picks it up looks at elinor and opens dear mrs dashwood miss dashwood miss marianne and captain margaret it gives me great pleasure to restore this atlas to
its rightful owner
alas business in london does not permit me to accompany it although this is likely to hurt me far more than it hurts you
for the present my memories of your kindness must be enough to sustain me and i remain your devoted servant always
a silence greets this brief epistle
elinor struggles to contain her bitter disappointment
but why hasnt he come
he says he is busy dear
he said hed come
margaret is genuinely upset
elinor quietly hangs up mariannes bonnet
why hasnt he come
mrs dashwood looks beseechingly at marianne who nods and grasps margarets hand
i am taking you for a walk
ive been a walk
you need another
it is going to rain
marianne shoves her bonnet back on and drags margaret out
it is not going to rain
you always say that and then it always does
we hear the front door slam behind them
there is a short silence
i fear mrs jennings is a bad influence
she approaches elinor
you must miss him elinor
elinor looks very directly at her mother
we are not engaged mamma
but he loves you dearest of that i am certain
elinor looks down
she speaks slowly choosing her words with care
i am by no means assured of his regard for me
but even were he to feel such a
preference i think we should be foolish to assume that there would not be many obstacles to his choosing a woman of no rank who cannot afford to buy sugar
but elinor your heart must tell you in such a situation mamma it is perhaps better to use ones head
she clears her throat rises determinedly picks up the accounts book and opens it
mrs dashwood is silenced
marianne walks very briskly dragging an unwilling margaret behind her
it has started to rain
mists are gathering around the two figures walking against the wind
is there any felicity in the world superior to this
i told you it would rain
there is some blue sky
let us chase it
im not supposed to run
marianne runs off down the hill into the heart of the mist
margaret stumbles after her grumbling
we follow marianne in her headlong descent and suddenly dramatically she trips and sprawls to the ground letting out a sharp cry of pain
she tries to get up but the pain in her ankle is too great
she sinks back to the ground
margaret is very alarmed
margaret run home and fetch help
the mists have thickened
they can no longer see where they are
despite her rising fear margaret squares her shoulders bravely and tries to sense the direction
i think it is this way
i will run as fast as i can marianne
she dashes off
as she goes into the mist we hear the thunder of hooves
cu margarets terrified expression
they seem to be coming from all around
she wheels and turns and then crash
through the mist breaks a huge white horse
astride sits an adonis in hunting gear
the horse rears
its rider controls it and slides off
he rushes to mariannes side
are you hurt
transfixed only my ankle
may i have your permission to he indicates her leg
decorous perhaps faintly impish
ascertain if there are any breaks
marianne nods speechlessly
with great delicacy he feels her ankle
margarets eyes are out on chapel hooks
marianne almost swoons with embarrassment and excitement mixed
it is not broken
now can you put your arm about my neck
marianne does not need any encouragement
he lifts her effortlessly and calls to his horse bedivere
it trots obediently forward
the stranger smiles down at marianne
allow me to escort you home
rain is thudding against the window from which mrs dashwood turns looking very worried
marianne was sure it would not rain
which invariably means it will
but we can see she is trying to conceal her anxiety from her mother
there are noises in the hall
margaret runs into the room dripping wet
she fell over
she fell down and hes carrying her
mrs dashwood and elinor rush to the front door
they see the stranger carrying marianne up the garden path his scarlet coat staining the monochrome rain
the stranger reaches the door
this is no time for introductions
in here sir this way
margaret open the door wider
please sir lay her here
marianne are you in pain
they move into the parlour
marianne is carried in surrounded by elinor mrs dashwood and margaret
it is a twisted ankle
do not be alarmed mamma
the stranger deposits marianne on the sofa
they look straight into each others eyes
i can assure you it is not serious
i took the liberty of feeling the bone and it is perfectly sound
elinor raises her eyebrows at marianne who blushes to her roots
sir i cannot even begin to thank you
please do not think of it
im honoured of be of service
will you not be seated
pray excuse me i have no desire to leave a water mark
but permit me to call tomorrow afternoon and inquire after the patient
we shall look forward to it
he turns to marianne and smiles
she smiles back gloriously
he bows and sweeps out of the room
hissing his name
mrs dashwood silences her with a gesture and follows him out with all the solicitous charm she can command while margaret pokes her head around the door to watch
elinor is removing mariannes boot and trying not to laugh at her
mrs dashwood calls out after him
please tell us to whom we are so much obliged
the stranger mounts bedivere and turns to her
john willoughby of allenham your servant maam
and he gallops off into the mist we almost expect bedivere to sprout wings
close on mrs dashwoods excited expression
mrs dashwood runs back into the parlour jittering with excitement and anxiety
mr john willoughby of allenham
what an impressive gentleman
he lifted me as if i weighed no more than a dried leaf
is he human
marianne hits elinor
mrs dashwood tends to her ankle
tell me if i hurt you
regarding mariannes ecstatic expression she feels no pain mamma
margaret ask betsy to make up a cold compress please
leaving reluctantly did you see him
he expressed himself well did he not
with great decorum and honour
and spirit and wit and feeling
and economy ten words at most
from below stairs we can hear margaret wailing wait for me
and he is to come tomorrow
you must change marianne you will catch a cold
what care i for colds when there is such a man
you will care very much when your nose swells up
you are right
help me elinor
margaret comes back with the bandages
what has happened
we have decided to give you to the gypsies
elinor and marianne go upstairs
margaret whispers to mrs will they be married before edward and elinor do you think mamma
margaret you are worse than mrs jennings
the rain has cleared
sir johns horse munches grass contentedly by the side of the road
mr willoughby is well worth catching miss dashwood miss marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself
the dashwoods are having a frustrating time winkling information about willoughby out of sir john who is in turn only anxious to protect brandons interest
marianne has her bandaged foot up on the sofa and is fast losing patience
but what do you know of mr willoughby sir john
decent shot and there is not a bolder rider in all england
but what is he like
what are his tastes
mystified well he has the nicest little bitch of a pointer was she out with him yesterday
marianne gives up
mrs dashwood takes over
where is allenham sir john
nice little estate three miles east
he is to inherit it from an elderly relative lady allen is her name
now they are getting somewhere
marianne is about to ask another question when they hear a horse galloping up
everyone is electrified
margaret runs to the window and turns back in disappointment
it is colonel brandon
i shall go outside and keep watch
margaret runs out of the room
you are all on the lookout for willoughby eh
dear me poor brandon
you will none of you think of him now
brandon is admitted by betsy
he is carrying a large bunch of hothouse flowers
how is the invalid
he hands marianne the flowers with a smile
thank you so much colonel
she rather absently hands the flowers to elinor who goes for a vase
sir john gestures at brandon with bluff insensitivity
miss marianne i cannot see why you should set your cap at mr willoughby when you have already made such a splendid conquest
i have no intention of setting my cap at anyone sir john
mr willoughby lady allens nephew
brandons light tone betrays no emotion
elinor comes back in with the flowers and puts them on the table next to aye he visits every year for he is to inherit allenham and he has a
very pretty estate of his own miss dashwood combe magna in somerset
if i were you i would not give him up to my younger sister in spite of all this tumbling down hills
suddenly margaret runs in screaming mariannes preserver
at the top of her voice
everyone starts to move at once
margaret is silenced
brandon looks at marianne whose incandescent expression makes her feelings all too clear
here is the man himself
come brandon we know when we are not wanted
let us leave him to the ladies
sir john and the colonel are leaving
marianne looks up suddenly self conscious
thank you for the flowers
elinor sees them out
we hear willoughbys voice outside
close on mariannes radiant anticipation
willoughby is shaking hands with colonel brandon and sir how do you do colonel
how does he do
how do you do more like
go on in theyre waiting for you
brandon looks at willoughby for a moment
then brandon and sir john exit
elinor leads in willoughby
mrs dashwood greets him with outstretched arms
what a pleasure to see you again
the pleasure is all mine i can asstire you
i trust miss marianne has not caught cold
you have found out my name
the neighbourhood is crawling with my spies
he suddenly produces a bunch of wild flowers from behind his back and offers them to marianne with a courtly humorous bow
and since you cannot venture out to nature nature must be brought to you
these are not from the hothouse
willoughby sees brandons flowers
i see mine is not the first offering nor the most elegant
i am afraid i obtained these from an obliging field
but i have always preferred wild flowers
i suspected as much
elinor takes the delicate flowers from willoughby
i will put these in water
our gratitude mr willoughby is beyond expression but it is i who am grateful
i have often passed this cottage and grieved for its lonely state and then the first news i had from lady allen when i arrived was that it was taken
i felt a peculiar interest in the event which nothing can account for but my present delight in meeting you
he is merry spirited voluble a breath of fresh air
elinor brings back willoughbys flowers and places them next to brandons on the side table
pray sit down mr willoughby
she indicates a chair but willoughby sees a book lying on mariannes footstool picks it up and to her great delight sits down on the stool at her feet
who is reading shakespeares sonnets
everyone answers at once
we all are
marianne has been reading them out to us
which are your favourites
it is a general question but marianne gaily commandeers it
without a doubt mine is
let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments
love is not love which alters when it alteration finds or bends with the remover to remove then how does it go
it is an ever fixed mark
willoughby joins in the line halfway through and continues
elinor and mrs dashwood exchange glances
clearly their contribution to this conversation will be minimal
that looks on storms or is it tempests
let me find it
willoughby gets out a tiny leatherbound book
it is strange you should be reading them for look i carry this with me always
it is a miniature copy of the sonnets
marianne is delighted and mutually astonished at this piece of synchronicity they proceed to look up other favourites chatting as though they were already intimates
mrs dashwood smiles at elinor with satisfaction
elinor amused picks up her sewing
willoughby and marianne are oblivious to everything but each other
willoughby is leaving
he has a flower from mariannes bunch in his buttonhole and is on his horse looking about as virile as his horse
everyone has come out to say goodbye marianne supported by elinor and mrs dashwood
and my pocket sonnets are yours miss marianne
a talisman against further injury
he gallops off
they all wave
margaret follows him down the road for a while
good work marianne
you have covered all forms of poetry another meeting will ascertain his views on nature and romantic attachments and then you will have nothing left to talk about and the
acquaintanceship will be over
i suppose i have erred against decorum
i should have been dull and spiritless and talked only of the weather or the state of the roads
no but mr willoughby can be in no doubt of your enthusiasm for him
why should he doubt it
why should i hide my regard
no particular reason marianne only that we know so little of him but time alone does not determine intimacy
seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other and seven days are more than enough for others
or seven hours in this case
i feel i know mr willoughby well already
if i had weaker more shallow feelings perhaps i could conceal them as you do then she realises what shes said
marianne that is not fair i am sorry elinor i did not mean i know
do not trouble yourself marianne
elinor turns back into the house
i do not understand her mamma
why does she never mention edward
i have never even seen her cry about him or about norland
but elinor is not like you or i dear
she does not like to be swayed by her emotions
close on edwards handkerchief
we can see the monogram ecf clearly
close on elinor staring out of the window
tears stand in her eyes but she presses the handkerchief to them before they fall
tea has been served
elinor colonel brandon mrs dashwood and mrs jennings play at cards
in a far corner of the room marianne is concentrating as she draws a silhouette
willoughbys profile glows behind the screen in front of her she looks up and stops gazing bewitched at his beauty
the lips move a whisper marianne
then louder havent you finished
he moves out from behind the screen eyes full of laughter
they look at each other
elinor and mrs dashwood are at the accounts
willoughby and marianne are on the other side of the room in the window seat whispering together
clearly he is already part of the family
surely you are not going to deny us beef as well as sugar
there is nothing under tenpence a pound
we have to economise
do you want us to starve
just not to eat beef
mrs dashwood is silenced but sighs crossly
elinor looks over to the lovers and sees willoughby in the act of cutting off a lock of mariannes hair which he kisses and places in his pocket book
elinor is transfixed by this strangely erotic moment
willoughby senses her gaze and looks over
she snaps her head back to her sums and is astonished to find that she has written edward at the top of the sheet
hastily she rubs it out and writes expenses
mrs jennings is talking to the elderly curate
other parishioners exit the church as willoughbys curricle the eighteenth century equivalent of a sports car goes flying by
marianne sits by his side the picture of happiness
mrs jennings nudges the curate and whispers
the parishioners stare after them and comment to each other
marianne and elinor are coming down the path together
marianne is dressed to go out
the argument has evidently started indoors and is being continued here
if there was any true impropriety in my behaviour i should be sensible of it elinor but as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks do you
not begin to doubt your own discretion
if the impertinent remarks of such as mrs jennings are proof of impropriety then we are all offending every moment of our lives the conversation is halted by the arrival
of colonel brandon on horseback
dismounting miss dashwood
good morning colonel
i come to issue an invitation
a picnic on my estate at delaford if you would care to join us on thursday next
mrs jenningss daughter and her husband are traveling up especially
thank you colonel we shall be delighted
at that moment willoughbys curricle hoves into view and mariannes face lights up
to marianne i will of course be including mr willoughby in the party
even marianne is a little embarrassed and recollects her manners
she smiles kindly at brandon
i should be delighted to join you colonel
the colonel helps her into the curricle exchanging nods with willoughby who is regarding him with some suspicion
good morning miss dashwood good morning colonel
the colonel has invited us to delaford willoughby
i understand you have a particularly fine pianoforte colonel
the undercurrents of this conversation are decidedly tense
a broadwood grand
a broadwood grand
then i shall really be able to play for you
we shall look forward to it
marianne smiles her perfect happiness at him and he whips up the horses
they drive off waving their farewells
brandon looks after them for a silent moment and then collects himself and turns to elinor who is less than satisfied with their behaviour
your sister seems very happy
marianne does not approve of hiding her emotions
in fact her romantic prejudices have the unfortunate tendency to set propriety at naught
she is wholly unspoilt
rather too unspoilt in my view
the sooner she becomes acquainted with the ways of the world the better
colonel brandon looks at her sharply and then speaks very deliberately as though controlling some powerful emotion
i knew a lady like your sister the same impulsive sweetness of temper who was forced into as you put it a better acquaintance with the world
the result was only ruination and despair
he stops and briskly remounts his horse
do not desire it miss dashwood
people and carriages fill the drive the sun shines and the atmosphere is pleasantly expectant
sir john is organising the provision of blankets and parasols and colonel brandon is busy furnishing the drivers with their routes
there are three new faces a pretty blowsy woman charlotte palmer a stony faced man mr palmer and an exceedingly good looking girl lucy steele who are standing with elinor
marianne margaret mrs jennings and mrs dashwood
marianne is standing slightly apart looking out along the road impatient for willoughby
imagine my surprise mrs dashwood when charlotte and her lord and master appeared with our cousin lucy
the last person i expected to see
where did you pop out from miss
i was never so surprised to see anyone in all my life
lucy steele smiles shyly and looks at the ground
mrs jennings continues sotto voce to mrs dashwood
she probably came on purpose to share the fun for there are no funds for such luxuries at home poor thing
i had not seen you for so long dear mrs jennings i could not resist the opportunity
oh you sly thing
it was the misses dashwood she wanted to see not delaford mamma
i have heard nothing but miss dashwood this miss dashwood that for i dont know how long
and what do you think of them now you do see them lucy
my mother has talked of nothing else in her letters since you came to barton mrs dashwood
mr palmer are they not the very creatures she describes
mr palmer regards his wife with a less than enchanted expression
laughing gaily why mr palmer
do you know you are quite rude today
he is to be an mp you know mrs dashwood and it is very fatiguing for him for he is forced to make everybody like him he says it is
quite shocking i never said anything so irrational
dont palm all your abuses of the language upon me
to mrs dashwood mr palmer is so droll he is always out of humour
mr palmer does indeed have the air of a man under siege
willough by suddenly appears in his curricle
marianne waves to him with a radiant smile
mrs jennings nudges charlotte and points to marianne
here he is
now you shall see charlotte
willoughby drives up as close to marianne as possible making her laugh
how now mr willoughby
you must greet my daughter charlotte and mr palmer how do you do
and my little cousin miss lucy steele
welcome to our party miss steele
lucy bobs demurely
willoughby inclines his head politely leaps from the curricle and hands marianne in
mrs jennings coos and chuckles at them
charlotte nudges elinor
i know mr willoughby extremely well not that i ever spoke to him but i have seen him forever in town
your sister is monstrous lucky to get him
mamma says colonel brandon is in love with her as well which is a very great compliment for he hardly ever falls in love with anyone
elinor smiles politely
willoughby moves the curricle out to the front of the drive
charlotte points after them and laughs with mrs jennings
lucy edges up beside elinor
may i beg a seat beside you miss dashwood
i have so longed to make your better acquaintance
i have heard nothing but the highest praise for you
elinor is relieved to change the subject
i would be delighted
but sir john and mrs jennings are too excessive in their compliments
i am sure to disappoint
no for it was from quite another source that i heard you praised and one not at all inclined to exaggeration
lucy speaks in a knowing confidential undertone as though not wanting anyone else to hear
at that moment a horseman thunders up the drive towards them
everyone turns to face the new arrival
what can this be
it is a messenger who has obviously had a long hard ride
he asks for colonel brandon and hands him a letter which brandon tears open
mrs jennings is puce with suppressed curiosity
what is the matter brandon
i must away to london
everyone gathers round brandon who is naturally mortified
a servant brings up the colonels horse
there is a murmur of disappointment from the party
sir john is embarrassed and protests again
but brandon we are all assembled
we cannot picnic at delaford without our host
go up to town tomorrow
or wait till we return and start then you would not be six hours later
i cannot afford to lose one minute
as he speaks he is mounting his horse
his grave urgency silences all protest and he gallops off leaving everyone stunned and of course deeply curious
then they all start to talk at once
lucy is still next to elinor
oh miss dashwood i cannot bear it
just when i was to have the opportunity of speaking with you
having been denied their trip the dashwoods and willoughby have set out an impromptu picnic
willoughby is wandering restlessly about
the weather is sublime
frailty thy name is brandon
there are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure
i think he wrote the letter himself as a trick for getting out of it
indulgently you are a very wicked pair colonel brandon will be sadly missed
when he is the kind of man that everyone speaks well of and no one wants to talk to
colonel brandon is very highly esteemed at the park
which is enough censure in itself
half laughing really willoughby
imitating mrs jennings perfectly come come mr impudence i know you and your wicked ways oh
he gives a little shriek and waddles about the garden doing her walk
he comes up to elinor and puts his head on her shoulder
come miss dashwood reveal your beau reveal him i say
lets have no secrets between friends
let me winkle them out of you
elinor hits him on the nose with her teaspoon and he waddles off to marianne
as mrs jennings i declare miss marianne if i do not have you married to the colonel by teatime i shall swallow my own bonnet
willoughby drops the parody suddenly
as if you could marry such a character
why should you dislike him
there is indeed an edge to willoughbys raillery
he flicks elinor an almost alarmed glance and then sweeps marianne to her feet and starts to dance around the garden with her
because he has threatened me with rain when i wanted it fine he has found fault with the balance of my curricle and i cannot persuade him to buy my
if it will be of any satisfaction to you however to be told i believe his character to be in all other respects irreproachable i am ready to confess it
and in return for an acknowledgement that must give me some pain
he is slowing down you cannot deny me the privilege
slower still of disliking him
and stopping as much as i adore
he and marianne are standing looking at each other
the expression on willoughbys face is heart stopping
margaret has stopped eating and is staring with her mouth open
elinor glances at mrs dashwood but she is gazing up at them with almost as many stars in her eyes as marianne
suddenly willoughby breaks the mood by swinging away from marianne and gesturing to the house
the tension is broken
margaret starts to chew again
i have great plans for improvements to it you know mr willoughby
now that i will never consent to
not a stone must be added to its walls
were i rich enough i would instantly pull down combe magna and build it up again in the exact image of that cottage
with dark narrow stairs a poky hall and a fire that smokes
especially the fire that smokes
then i might be as happy at combe magna as i have been at barton
he looks at marianne who has gone to sit at her mothers feet
but this place has one claim on my affection which no other can possibly share
marianne is so irradiated with happiness that she looks like an angel
promise me you will never change it
i do not have the heart
or the money
marianne is seeing willoughby off
miss marianne will you will you do me the honour of granting me an interview tomorrow alone
willoughby we are always alone
but there is something very particular i should like to ask you
there is something about his formal tone that makes her feel shy
i shall ask mamma if i may stay behind from church
until tomorrow then miss marianne
he mounts bedivere and leaves
marianne looks after him her eyes shining
he is coming to propose
a district of extreme poverty populated by the lowlife of london footpads dogs rats and scavengers of all kinds
in the distance a tavern belches forth drunken revellers who sway and reel into the night
a hooded horseman pulls up his exhausted steed at the entrance to a slum
he dismounts and looks up at one of the windows
the rags hanging there twitch as if someone is watching for him
he strides inside
stepping over a supine beggar at the foot of the stairs the horseman flings back his hood it is brandon hollow eyed and dropping with weariness
we follow him up the stairs to a door which is opened by an older woman
he enters a bare room partitioned with filthy rags hung from the ceiling and lit with stinking tallow lamps
at the window stands the slight figure of a very young woman
brandon reacts with a tender smile which stiffens into an expression of deep shock
we see her silhouette
she is heavily pregnant
she bursts into tears and runs into his arms
amongst the small congregation listening to the sermon drone on we see the excited faces of elinor margaret and mrs do you think he will kneel down when he asks
with satisfaction they always kneel down
the dashwoods return from church to find thomas grooming bedivere at the garden gate
their excitement mounts
they all enter the cottage talking nonsense loudly in order to signal their presence
suddenly marianne bursts out of the parlour sobbing and disappears into the room opposite
elinor and margaret stand by the door in utter consternation while mrs dash wood goes to marianne
what is wrong my dearest
marianne shakes her head and waves them away
elinor margaret and mrs dashwood enter to find willoughby standing in a frozen attitude by the fireplace
what is the matter
i forgive me mrs dashwood
i am sent that is to say lady allen has exercised the privilege of riches upon a dependent cousin and is sending me to london
he cannot look any of them in the eye
when this morning
almost this moment
how very disappointing
but your business will not detain you from us for long i hope
you are very kind but i have no idea of returning immediately to devonshire
i am seldom invited to allenham more than once a year
for shame willoughby
can you wait for an invitation from barton cottage
my engagements at present are of such a nature that is i dare not flatter myself the atmosphere is thick with tension
willoughby flicks a glance at the three women staring at him in mute astonishment
it is folly to linger in this manner
i will not torment myself further
he rushes past them and out of the cottage
they follow him to the door
the dashwoods cluster round the door
willoughby come back
she is silenced by elinor as willoughby seizes bediveres reins from thomas mounts up and rides off at a furious pace
they all rush back into the parlour
meg dearest please ask betsy to make a cup of hot tea for marianne
margaret nods dumbly and goes
mrs dashwood has her arms around marianne
what is wrong my love
please do not ask me questions
marianne struggles free
please let me be
she runs off upstairs and we hear her bedroom door slamming
there is a moment of stunned silence
they must have quarreled
that is unlikely
perhaps this lady allen disapproves of his regard for marianne and has invented an excuse to send him away
then why did he not say as much
it is not like willoughby to be secretive
did he think marianne was richer than she is
how could he
she gestures to the room and then looks at elinor with a frown
what is it you suspect him of
i can hardly tell you
but why was his manner so guilty
what are you saying elinor
that he has been acting a part to your sister for all this time
mrs dashwood is getting defensive
elinor pauses to think
no he loves her i am sure
of course he loves her
but has he left her with any assurance of his return
cannot you ask her if he has proposed
i cannot force a confidence from marianne and nor must you
we must trust her to confide in us in her own time
shaking her head there was something so underhand in the manner of his leaving
you are resolved then to think the worst of him
not resolved cold i prefer to give him the benefit of my good opinion
he deserves no less
from all of us
she stalks out of the room and starts up the stairs
elinor follows her
mamma i am very fond of willoughby mrs dashwood goes into her bedroom and shuts the door
elinor is halfway up the stairs
she meets a wet eyed margaret coming down with a cup of tea
she would not let me in
elinor takes the cup and margaret runs out into the garden in tears
the sound of sobbing also comes from mariannes room and now from mrs dashwoods as well
elinor sits down helplessly on the stairs and drinks the tea
the rain has settled in
the cottage looks cold and bleak
betsy carries another uneaten meal from mariannes room
she looks at the food and tuts in anxiety
marianne is sitting by the window looking out at the rain through tear swollen eyes
willoughbys sonnets are on her lap
how like a winter hath my absence been from thee the pleasure of the fleeting year
what freezings have i felt what dark days seen
what old decembers bareness everywhere
smoke issues from every chimney in the place
dinner is over
marianne sits listlessly by the window
mr palmer is hiding behind a newspaper
sir john and margaret are looking at a map and discussing routes through china
lucy charlotte mrs dashwood and mrs jennings are at cards
elinor is reading
if only this rain would stop
from behind the paper if only you would stop
mrs jennings and charlotte laugh at him
twas you took her off my hands mr palmer and a very good bargain you made of it too but now i have the whip hand over you for you
cannot give her back
the heavy silence behind the paper attests to the unhappy truth of this statement
miss marianne come and play a round with us
looking out at the weather will not bring him back
sotto voce she ate nothing at dinner
mind we are all a little forlorn these days
london has swallowed all our company
charlotte and mrs jennings start to gossip about the disappearances of brandon and willoughby
lucy walks over and sits by elinor who politely puts aside the book
low dear miss dashwood perhaps now we might have our discussion
lucy looks around at mrs jennings and lowers her voice still further so that elinor is obliged to move her chair nearer
there is a particular question i have long wanted to ask you but perhaps you will think me impertinent
i cannot imagine so
but it is an odd question
forgive me i have no wish to trouble you she looks away coyly as if deciding whether to speak
my dear miss steele interrupting miss dashwood if only mr willoughby had gone home to combe magna we could have taken miss marianne to see him
for we live but half a mile away
five and a half
no i cannot believe it is that far for you can see the place from the top of our hill
is it really five and a half miles
i cannot believe it
you have my permission to ask any manner of question if that is of any help
i wonder are you at all acquainted with your sister in laws mother
elinor sits back in deep surprise
with fannys mother
no i have never met her
i am sure you think me strange for inquiring if i dared tell shouting over if she tells you aught of the famous mr f lucy you are to pass
elinor tries to ignore mrs jennings who is keeping a curious eye on them
will you take a turn with me miss dashwood
lucy rises and takes elinors arm
she guides her as far away as possible from mrs jennings and charlotte
i had no idea at all that you were connected with that family
i am certainly nothing to mrs ferrars at present but the time may come when we may be very intimately connected
low what do you mean
do you have an understanding with fannys brother robert
no i never saw him in my life
no with edward
elinor stops walking
edward and i have been secretly engaged these five years
elinor is frozen to the spot
you may well be surprised
i should never have mentioned it had i not known i could entirely trust you to keep our secret
edward cannot mind me telling you for he looks on you quite as his own sister
elinor walks on mechanically
disbelief has set in
i am sorry but we surely we cannot mean the same mr ferrars
the very same he was four years under the tutelage of my uncle mr pratt down in plymouth
has he never spoken of it
awareness dawning mr pratt
yes i believe he has
i was very unwilling to enter into it without his mothers approval but we loved each other with too great a passion for prudence
though you do nor know him so well as i miss dashwood you must have seen how capable he is of making a woman sincerely attached to him
i cannot pretend it has not been very hard on us both
we can hardly meet above twice a year
she sniffs and produces a large handkerchief which she holds to her eyes so that the monogram is clearly visible
elinor seeing the copy of the handkerchief she has held so dear moves quickly to a chair and sits down
you seem out of sorts miss dashwood are you quite well
perfectly well thank you
i have not offended you
on the contrary
mrs jennings has been watching
now she rises unable to contain herself
i can stand it no longer i must know what you are saying lucy
miss dashwood is quite engrossed
mrs jennings starts to bear down on them
lucy whispers with real urgency
oh miss dashwood if anyone finds out it will ruin him you must not tell a soul
edward says you would not break your word to save your life
ecu on elinors face
i give you my word
mrs jennings looms over them
well what can have fascinated you to such an extent miss dashwood
tell us all
elinor cannot speak but lucy glides smoothly in
we were talking of london maam and all its diversions
do you hear charlotte
mrs jennings claps her hands delightedly
while you were so busy whispering charlotte and i have concocted a plan
it is the best plan in the world
i make for london shortly and i invite you lucy and both the misses dashwood to join me
elinor cannot hide her dismay
marianne springs from her seat
oh can i go
can i go
you know perfectly well you are too young dearest
i shall convey you all to my house in berkeley street and we shall taste all the delights of the season what say you
oh please can i go
im twelve soon
mr palmer do you not long to have the misses dashwood come to london
i came into devonshire with no other view
elinor exerts herself
mrs jennings you are very kind but we cannot possibly leave our mother
lucys calculating eyes turn to mrs dashwood with alacrity
indeed the loss would be too great
a chorus of objections goes up particularly from mrs dashwood who is both delighted and relieved to see marianne with a smile on her face
your mother can spare you very well
of course i can
of course she can
and look at miss marianne it would break her heart to deny her
i will brook no refusal miss dashwood
marianne claps her hands her eyes ablaze with joy
mrs jennings takes elinors hand
let you and me strike hands upon the bargain and if i do not have the three of you married by christmas it will not be my fault
we are in elinor and mariannes bedroom
elinor is in bed
she is lying on her side with her back to marianne
we are close on her face
marianne is running around excitedly pulling out ribbons looking at dresses etc
i was never so grateful in all my life as i am to mrs jennings
what a kind woman she is
i like her more than i can say
i shall see willoughby
think how surprised he will be
and you will see edward
elinor cannot reply
are you asleep
with you in the room
i do not believe you feel as calm as you look not even you elinor
i will never sleep tonight
oh what were you and miss steele whispering about so long
close on elinors expression as she struggles with the impossibility of unburdening herself to her sister without breaking her promise to lucy
after a pause nothing of significance
marianne looks at elinor curiously then returns to her packing
mrs dashwood and margaret are waving mrs jenningss carriage off
marianne waves back with such exuberance that she practically falls out
mrs jennings is chattering about london to marianne who listens with new found tolerance
lucy is whispering into elinors ear
i have written to edward miss dashwood and yet i do not know how much i may see of him
secrecy is vital he will never be able to call
i should imagine not
it is so hard
i believe my only comfort has been the constancy of his affection
you are fortunate over such a lengthy engagement never to have had any doubts on that score
lucy looks at elinor sharply but elinor is impassive
i am of rather a jealous nature and if he had talked more of one young lady than any other
but he has never given a moments alarm on that count
we can see from elinors expression that she understands lucy perfectly
the strain around her eyes is pronounced
imagine how glad he will be to learn that we are friends
mrs jenningss carriage trundles along
establishing shot of a handsome town house
mrs jenningss carriage comes into shot and stops in front of it
they enter the grand hallway under the supercilious gaze of a powdered footman mr pigeon
elinor is haggard after two days of close proximity with lucy
mrs jennings is all officious bustle and marianne is feverish with anticipation
she whispers to mrs jennings who laughs heartily
to be sure my dear you must just hand it to pigeon there
he will take care of it
marianne hands a letter to the sphinx like footman
we can see a large w in the address
elinor looks at marianne inquiringly but marianne moves away from her
lord above you do not waste any time miss marianne
marianne glances self consciously at elinor and follows mrs jennings upstairs
lucy goes up to elinor and whispers
so they are definitely engaged
mrs jennings says your sister will buy her wedding clothes here in town
indeed miss steele i know of no such plan
but elinor does not know what else to say
she marches firmly upstairs
marianne and elinor have changed from their traveling clothes and are having a cup of tea
at least elinor is
marianne is pacing up and down in front of the window
john and fanny are in town
i think we shall be forced to see them
there is a faint knocking from somewhere
i think it was for next door
marianne looks out of the window
yes you are right
she sits down with a rueful smile
suddenly a much louder rap is heard and they both jump
we hear a bustling downstairs
marianne can hardly breathe
she goes to the drawing room door opens it goes out comes back in
we hear a mans voice
it is willoughby indeed it is
she turns and almost throws herself into the arms of colonel oh
excuse me colonel she leaves the room hastily
elinor is so ashamed of mariannes rudeness that she does not at first notice brandons mood of tense distress
colonel brandon what a pleasure to see you
have you been in london all this while
how is your dear mother
very well thank you
colonel is there anything but brandon interrupts her
forgive me miss dashwood but i have heard reports through town
is it impossible to but i could have no chance of succeeding indeed i hardly know what to do
tell me once and for all is everything finally resolved between your sister and mr willoughby
elinor is torn between discomfiture and compassion
colonel though neither one has informed me of their under standing i have no doubt of their mutual affection
brandon stands very still
thank you miss dashwood
to your sister i wish all imaginable happiness
to mr willoughby that he
may endeavour to deserve her
his tone is heavy with some bitter meaning
what do you mean
but he recollects himself
forgive me i forgive me
he bows and leaves abruptly
elinor is deeply troubled
the palmers mrs jennings john fanny lucy elinor and marianne are walking through the arcade
additional wealth has evidently encouraged fanny sartorially and she sprouts as much fruit and feathers as a market stall
lucy is holding elinors arm in a pinionlike grip
mrs jennings is gossiping with charlotte
mariannes good looks are heightened by her feverish expectation of seeing willoughby at every step and many young men raise their hats to her and turn as she passes
where is dear edward john
we expect to see him daily
lucys sharp eyes dart hither and thither
mrs jennings senses gossip
elinor steels herself
and who is dear edward
fanny smiles glacially
my brother mrs jennings edward ferrars
mrs jennings looks at elinor in sly triumph
is that ferrars with an f
she and charlotte chuckle to each other
lucy looks at elinor
mrs jennings lucy elinor and marianne return from their outing
marianne immediately assails pigeon
are there any messages pigeon
no message at all
affronted none ma am
marianne sighs with disappointment and starts up the stairs
mrs jennings looks archly at elinor
i note you do not inquire for your messages miss dashwood
no for i do not expect any mrs jennings
i have very little acquaintance in town
and she follows marianne firmly upstairs
lucy watches her go and mrs jennings chuckles and turns to her
she is as sly as you lucy
elinor wakes up
the flickering of a candle has disturbed her
she sits up in bed and sees marianne sitting at the desk in her nightgown writing another letter
marianne is anything wrong
nothing at all
go back to sleep
marianne in her nightclothes and dressing gown paces restlessly her letter in her hands
a slight knock at the door heralds a much ruffled pigeon wig askew
marianne hands him the letter
he bows and goes highly disgruntled
mrs jennings is giving pigeon his instructions for the day
marianne comes running downstairs
pigeon regards her drily
no messages ma am
marianne looks so dejected that mrs jennings takes her hand
do not fret my dear
i am told that this good weather is keeping many sportsmen in the country at present but the frost will drive them back to town very soon depend upon it
i had not thought of thank you mrs jennings
she runs back upstairs
mrs jennings calls after her
and miss dashwood may set her heart at rest for i overheard your sister in law say that she was to bring the elusive mr f to the ball tonight
so many carriages have entered the crescent to deliver the guests that gridlock has occurred and people are forced to walk to the entrance
we see mrs jennings marianne elinor and lucy alighting from their carriage and picking their way through the mud their skirts raised above their ankles
elinor nearly trips and is obliged to grab onto lucy in order not to slip into the dirt
the great ballroom is crammed with guests all determined to enjoy themselves despite the considerable inconveniences caused by noise heat and overcrowding
men are sweating profusely women dab their brows rack punch is being swallowed by the gallon flirting is conducted at fever pitch and all conversation is inordinately loud
only the dancers have a modicum of space in which to perform their mincing steps
mrs jennings and her brood bump into the palmers
screeching this is very merry
mrs jennings then spots fanny who is conducting a desultory conversation with an overpowdered acquaintance
she drags elinor marianne and lucy over to her
there you are
goodness how hot it is mrs dashwood
you are not alone i trust
john is just gone to fetch my brother he has been eating ices
lucy clutches at elinors sleeve
i declare that is good news indeed
at long last
and she beams her approval upon elinor
whispering miss dashwood i declare i shall faint clean away
fanny has seen john threading his way towards them and waves at him
there is someone behind him
john bows to them
mrs jennings may i present my brother in law
he turns to reveal a good looking young man with a vacuous smile
mr robert ferrars
my dear ladies we meet at last
there is a general bowing and shaking of hands
elinor is relieved
lucy drops a low curtsy
so you must be the younger brother
is mr edward not here
miss dashwood here was counting on him
robert looks elinor up and down
he exchanges glances with fanny before he speaks
he is far too busy for such gatherings and has no special acquaintance here to make his attendance worthwhile
mrs jennings looks at elinor in puzzlement
well i declare i do not know what the young men are about these days are they all in hiding
elinor looks down agonised with embarrassment
come mr robert in the absence of your brother you must dance with our lovely miss dashwood
not best pleased it would be my honour
he turns to lucy and bows
and perhaps miss steele might consider reserving the allemande
lucy curtsies again
robert escorts a most unwilling elinor onto the dance floor
you reside in devonshire i blieve miss dashwood
in a cottage
i am excessively fond of a cottage
if i had any money to spare i should build one myself
luckily for elinor the set changes and she is obliged to turn away from robert
she wheels round to face her new partner
it is willoughby
they both stop dancing and stare at each other aghast
a traffic jam starts and they are forced to take hands and resume the steps
stiff how do you do miss dashwood
elinor does not know quite how to respond
i am well thank you mr willoughby
she looks about for marianne instinctively wanting to keep her away from willoughby
how is your family
cold we are all extremely well mr willoughby thank you for your kind inquiry
willoughby is shamed into silence
then he sees marianne
at the same moment the music pauses
marianne looks up
in the brief moment of relative quiet her great cry rings across the room
everyone turns to look as marianne rushes towards him with both arms outstretched her face luminous with joy
as the noise of the room builds again and people change their partners we are aware that many are surreptitiously watching
marianne reaches him but willoughby stands with his arms frozen at his side
marianne gives a little confused laugh
good god willoughby
will you nor shake hands with me
willoughby looks extremely uncomfortable and glances towards a group of very smart people who are watching him closely
central to this group is a sophisticated woman who frowns at him proprietorially
willoughby shakes mariannes hand briefly
behind her mrs jennings is giving an animated commentary to fanny and john while lucy whispers in roberts ear as they go past to join the set
strangled how do you do miss marianne
willoughby what is the matter
why have you not come to see me
were you not in london
have you nor received my letters
willoughby is sweating with tension
yes i had the pleasure of receiving the information which you were so good as to send me
piteously for heavens sake willoughby tell me what is wrong
thank you i am most obliged
if you will excuse me i must return to my party
he bows white to the teeth and walks away to join the willoughby
he is drawn away by his party some of whom look back at marianne with a mixture of curiosity and condescension
marianne almost sinks to her knees
elinor supports her
go to him elinor force him to come to me
mrs jennings has come up full of concern
dearest do not betray what you feel to everyone present
this is not the place for explanations come along dear
they almost have to drag marianne away
mrs jennings turns back to the dashwood party
fanny and john have practically imploded with embarrassment and are distancing themselves as much as possible from the source
lucy and robert are dancing nearby
will you come lucy
oh are we leaving so soon
if i might be so bold mrs jennings it would be our pleasure to escort your young charge home
how very kind
that is very handsome she rushes off to follow marianne and elinor
we stay for a moment with lucy and robert who have left the set
she actually sent him messages during the night
cam rises to show the dashwoods exiting past the whispering sneering faces of the crowd
marianne sits scribbling a letter at the desk
marianne please tell me do not ask me questions
you have no confidence in me
this reproach from you
you who confide in no one
i have nothing to tell
we have neither of us anything to tell
i because i conceal nothing and you because you communicate nothing
a silent breakfast
marianne is red eyed from crying and limp from lack of sleep
mrs jennings is dressed to go out pulling on her gloves and bustling as usual
pigeon enters with a letter on a salver
he offers it to marianne
she seizes it and runs out of the room
mrs jennings chuckles
lovers quarrels are swift to heal
that letter will do the trick mark my word
she goes to the door
i must be off
i hope he wont keep her waiting much longer miss dashwood
it hurts to see her looking so forlorn
she leaves and elinor finds herself alone with lucy who loses no time in sharing her new found happiness
what a welcome i had from edwards family miss dashwood i am surprised you never told me what an agreeable woman your sister in law is
and mr robert all so affable
it is perhaps fortunate that none of them knows of your engagement
elinor rises and leaves
elinor finds marianne sitting on the edge of the bed
she does not acknowledge elinor but merely lifts the letter and reads out with deadly calm my dear madam i am quite at a loss to discover in what point
i could be so unfortunate as to offend you
my esteem for your family is very sincere but if i have given rise to a belief of more than i felt or meant to express i shall reproach myself
for not having been more guarded
my affections have long been engaged elsewhere and it is with great regret that i return your letters and the lock of hair which you so obligingly bestowed upon me
i am etc
marianne gives a great howl of pain and flings herself across the bed as though in physical agony
marianne oh marianne it is better to know at once what his intentions are
dearest think of what you would have felt if your engagement had carried on for months and months before he chose to put an end to it
we are not engaged
but you wrote to him
i thought then that he must have left you with some kind of understanding
no he is not so unworthy as you think him
not so unworthy
did he tell you that he loved you
no never absolutely
it was every day implied but never declared
sometimes i thought it had been but it never was
he has broken no vow
he has broken faith with all of us he made us all believe he loved you
he did he loved me as i loved him
mrs jennings bursts through the door in her hat and coat panting
i had to come straight up how are you miss marianne
marianne begins to sob uncontrollably
she looks very bad
no wonder miss dashwood for it is but too true
i was told here in the street by miss morton who is a great friend he is to be married at the end of the month to a miss grey
with fifty thousand pounds
well said i if tis true then he is a good for nothing who has used my young friend abominably ill and i wish with all my soul that his
wife may plague his heart out
she goes round the bed to comfort marianne
but he is not the only young man worth having my dear and with your pretty face you will never want for admirers
marianne sobs even harder
she had better have her cry out and have done with it
i will go and look out something to tempt her does she care for olives
i cannot tell you
mrs jennings leaves
marianne seizes the letter again
i cannot believe his nature capable of such cruelty
marianne there is no excuse for him this is his hand but it cannot be his heart
i want mamma
elinor please take me home
cannot we go tomorrow
there is no one to take us
cannot we hire a carriage
we have no money and indeed we owe mrs jennings more courtesy
all she wants is gossip and she only likes me because i supply it
i cannot endure to stay
i will find a way
fanny john and robert are drinking chocolate together
apparently they never were engaged
miss grey has fifty thousand pounds
marianne is virtually penniless
she cannot have expected him to go through with it
but i feel for marianne she will lose her bloom and end a spinster like elinor
i think my dear we might consider having them to stay with us for a few days we are after all family and my father
he trails off
fanny exchanges an alarmed glance with robert
she thinks fast
my love i would ask them with all my heart but i have already asked miss steele for a visit and we cannot deprive mrs jennings of all her company
we can invite your sisters some other year you know and miss steele will profit far more from your generosity poor girl
that is very thoughtful fanny
we shall ask elinor and marianne next year then
mrs jenningss carriage stands outside
a livened footman opens the door and lucy steps out brandishing a new muff
marianne sits alone on the bed
around her lie her notes to willoughby her lock of hair and the pocket sonnets
in her hands is the creased and tear stained letter from willoughby which she is examining over and over
elinor is seated at a desk writing a letter
there is a sudden rap at the front door
footsteps are heard and as she turns the maid enters with colonel brandon
elinor rises to greet him
thank you for coming colonel
elinor is on edge
brandon looks haggard with concern
how does your sister
i must get her home as quickly as possible
the palmers can take us as far as cleveland which is but a day from barton then permit me to accompany you and take you straight on from cleveland to
elinor takes his hands gratefully
i confess that is precisely what i had hoped for
marianne suffers cruelly and what pains me most is how hard she tries to justify mr willoughby
but you know her disposition
after a moment brandon nods
he seems unable to remain still or calm and finds it difficult to begin speaking
perhaps i my regard for you all miss dashwood will you allow me to prove it by relating some circumstances which nothing but an earnest desire of being useful you
have something to tell me of mr willoughby
nods when i quitted barton last but i must go further back
a short account of myself will be necessary
no doubt mrs jennings has apprised you of certain events in my past the sad outcome of my connection with a young woman named eliza
what is not commonly known is that twenty years ago eliza bore an illegitimate child
the father whoever he was abandoned them
this is strong stuff
elinors concern deepens
as she lay dying she begged me to look after the child
eliza died in my arms broken wasted away ah
miss dashwood such a subject untouched for so many years it is dangerous
he paces about barely able to conceal his distress
i had failed eliza in every other way i could not refuse her now
i took the child beth is her name and placed her with a family where i could be sure she would be well looked after
i saw her whenever i could
i saw that she was headstrong like her mother and god forgive me i indulged her i allowed her too much freedom
almost a year ago she disappeared
i instigated a search but for eight months i was left to imagine the worst
at last on the day of the delaford picnic i received the first news her
she was with child
and the blackguard who had brandon stops and looks straight at elinor
do you mean willoughby
elinor drops into a chair utterly shocked
before i could return to confront him lady allen learned of his behaviour and turned him from the house
he beat a hasty retreat to london yes
he left us that morning without any explanation
lady allen had annulled his legacy
he was left with next to nothing and in danger of losing all that remained to his debtors and so abandoned marianne for miss grey and her fifty thousand pounds
brandon is silent
elinor is breathless
have you seen mr willoughby since you learned
nodding we met by appointment he to defend i to punish his conduct
elinor stares at him aghast
we returned unwounded so the meeting never got abroad
elinor nods and is silent for a moment
is beth still in town
she has chosen to go into the country for her confinement
such has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter and so imperfectly have i discharged my trust
i would not have burdened you miss dashwood had i not from my heart believed it might in time lessen your sisters regrets
brandon moves to the door and then stops
he turns to her and speaks with effort
i have described mr willoughby as the worst of libertines but i have since learned from lady allen that he did mean to propose that day
therefore i cannot deny that his intentions towards marianne were honourable and i feel certain he would have married her had it not been for for the money
she looks up at brandon
marianne is sitting on the bed staring into space
elinor is kneeling by her holding her hands
dearest was i right to tell you
whatever his past actions whatever his present course at least you may be certain that he loved you
but not enough
elinor sits alone with her head in her hands
suddenly mrs jennings hustles in looking pleased
here is someone to cheer you up miss dashwood
she is followed in by lucy
mrs jennings leaves busy as ever
lucy plants an expression of ghastly concern on her face
how is your dear sister miss dashwood
i must say i do not know what i should do if a man treated me with so little respect
i hope you are enjoying your stay with john and fanny miss steele
i was never so happy in my entire life miss dashwood
i do believe your sister in law has taken quite a fancy to me
i had to come and tell you for you cannot imagine what has happened
no i cannot
yesterday i was introduced to edwards mother
and she was a vast deal more than civil
i have not yet seen edward but now i feel sure to very soon the maid comes back
theres a mr edward ferrars to see you miss dashwood
there is a tiny frozen silence
do ask him to come up
elinor quite involuntarily sits down and then stands up again
edward is admitted looking both anxious and eager
as lucy is sitting in the window seat at first he sees only elinor
miss dashwood how can i but elinor cuts him off
mr ferrars what a pleasure to see you
know miss steele of course
edward turns slowly and encounters lucys glassy smile
he all but blanches
then bows and clears his throat
how do you do miss steele
i am well thank you mr ferrars
edward has no notion of what to do or say
do sit down mr ferrars
lucys eyes are sharp as broken glass
edward remains on his feet looking helplessly from one woman to the other
you must be surprised to find me here mr ferrars
i expect you thought i was at your sisters house
this is precisely what edward had thought
he tries to smile but his facial muscles wont work
elinor decides to fetch help
let me call marianne mr ferrars
she would be most disappointed to miss you
elinor goes to the door thankful to escape but marianne prevents her by walking in at that moment
despite her anguish she is very pleased to see edward and embraces him warmly
i heard your voice
at last you have found us
edward is shocked by her appearance and momentarily forgets his own confusion
forgive me marianne my visit is shamefully overdue
you are pale
i hope you have not been unwell
oh dont think of me elinor is well you see that must be enough for both of us
marianne gestures to elinor encouragingly but edward seems unable to look at her
how do you like london marianne
not at all
the sight of you is all the pleasure it has afforded is that not so elinor
again marianne endeavours to ignite the lovers
elinor tries to silence marianne with her eyes but to no avail
marianne puts their coolness down to the presence of lucy at whom she glances with a none too friendly air
why have you taken so long to come and see us
i have been much engaged elsewhere
but what was that when there were such friends to be met
perhaps miss marianne you think young men never honour their engagements little or great
elinor is appalled by this remark but marianne does not notice it and turns back to lucy earnestly
no indeed for edward is the most fearful of giving pain and the most incapable of being selfish of anyone i ever saw
edward makes an uncomfortable noise
edward will you not sit
elinor help me to persuade him
now edward can stand it no longer
forgive me but i must take my leave but you are only just arrived
elinor rises desperate for them both to go
you must excuse me i have a commission to attend to for fanny lucy jumps in like a shot
in that case perhaps you might escort me back to your sisters house mr ferrars
there is an extremely awkward pause
i would be honoured
goodbye miss dashwood miss marianne
he shakes hands with elinor and with marianne who is silent with dismay
lucy takes edwards arm and looks up at him proprietorially
after a stiff bow and a muttered farewell from edward they leave
marianne looks at her sister in astonishment
why did you not urge him to stay
he must have had his reasons for going
his reason was no doubt your coldness
if i were edward i would assume you did not care for me at all
a tranquil afternoon
lucy is sitting with fanny who is doing some pointless basketwork
lucy hands fanny rushes
poor miss marianne looked very badly tother day
when i think of her deserted and abandoned it frightens me to think i shall never marry
you will marry far better than either of the dashwood girls
how can that possibly be
you have ten times their sense and looks
but i have no dowry
there are qualities which will always make up for that and you have them in abundance
it would not surprise me if you were to marry far and away beyond your expectations
i wish it might be so
there is a young man ah ha
i am glad to hear of it
is he of good breeding and fortune
oh both but his family would certainly oppose the match
they will allow it as soon as they see you my dear
it is a very great secret
i have told no one in the world for fear of discovery
fanny looks up curious to know more
my dear i am the soul of discretion
if i dared tell
i can assure you i am as silent as the grave
lucy leans forward to whisper in fannys ear
we hold a long shot of the house for a moment of silence
then from inside comes an almost inhumanly loud shriek
viper in my bosom
fanny is trying to drag lucy out of the house
robert and john are trying to reason with her
fanny loses her grip and falls backwards
lucy flings herself into roberts arms
robert falls over
mrs jennings is running as fast as her fat little legs will carry her
mrs jennings pants up the front steps
elinor and marianne are packing
their mood is gloomy and uncommunicative
mrs jennings explodes into the room fighting for breath
oh my dears
what a commotion
mr edward ferrars the very one i used to joke you about miss dashwood has been engaged these five years to lucy steele
marianne lets out a gasp
she looks at elinor who nods at her in swift confirmation
poor mr ferrars
his mother who by all accounts is very proud demanded that he break the engagement on pain of disinheritance
but he has refused to break his promise to lucy
he has stood by her good man and is cut off without a penny
she has settled it all irrevocably upon mr robert
but i cannot stop i must go to lucy
your sister in law scolded her like any fury drove her to hysterics
she leaves the room still rabbiting on
there is a silence
how long have you known
since the evening mrs jennings offered to take us to london
why did you not tell me
lucy told me in the strictest confidence
marianne looks at her in complete incredulity
i could not break my word
clearly there is no arguing this point
but edward loves you
he made me no promises
he tried to tell me about lucy
he cannot marry her
would you have him treat her even worse than willoughby has treated you
no but nor would i have him marry where he does not love
elinor tries hard to be controlled
edward made his promise a long time ago long before he met me
though he may
harbour some regret i believe he will be happy in the knowledge that he did his duty and kept his word
after all after all that is bewitching in the idea of ones happiness depending entirely on one person it is not always possible
we must accept
edward will marry lucy and you and i will go home
always resignation and acceptance
always prudence and honour and duty
elinor where is your heart
elinor finally explodes
she turns upon marianne almost savagely
what do you know of my heart
what do you know of anything but your own suffering
for weeks marianne i have had this pressing on me without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature
it was forced upon me by the very person whose prior claims ruined all my hopes
i have had to endure her exultation again and again while knowing myself to be divided from edward forever
believe me marianne had i not been bound to silence i could have produced proof enough of a broken heart even for you
then marianne speaks in a whisper
marianne bursts into sobs and flings her arms around elinor who almost impatiently tries to comfort her
lucy and mrs jennings are on the doorstep
lucy looks rather lost and pathetic with her little bundles hastily packed
the door opens and charlotte precedes the servant ushering them in with shrill cries of sympathy
i have heard that your friend mr ferrars has been entirely cast off by his family for persevering in his engagement to miss steele
elinor and brandon walk round the quiet square
have i been rightly informed
is it so
elinor is greatly taken aback by this unexpected query
it is indeed so
are you acquainted with mr ferrars
no we have never met
but i know only too well the cruelty the impolitic cruelty of dividing two young people long attached to one another
mrs ferrars does not know what she may drive her son to he pauses frowning in remembrance
elinor waits in suspense
i have a proposal to make that should enable him to marry miss steele immediately
since the gentleman is so close a friend to your family perhaps you will be good enough to mention it to him
elinor is completely taken aback
she takes a moment to reply
colonel i am sure he would be only too delighted to hear it from your own lips
i think not
his behaviour has proved him proud in the best sense
i feel certain this is the right course
elinor is waiting
the maid announces edward and he walks in momentarily
they are alone for the first time in months and for a moment neither speaks
elinor indicates a seat for him but neither sits
thank you for responding so promptly to my message
i was most grateful to receive it
i miss dashwood god knows what you must think of me
mr ferrars he interrupts her desperate to explain
i have no right to speak i know elinor has to stop him
mr ferrars i have good news
i think you know of our friend colonel brandon
edward looks completely bewildered
yes i have heard his name
elinor starts to speak rather faster than usual
colonel brandon desires me to say that understanding you wish to join the clergy he has great pleasure in offering you the parish on his estate at delaford now just
vacant in the hope that it may enable you and miss steele to marry
edward cannot at first take it in
elinor sits down
he means it as testimony of his concern for for the cruel situation in which you find yourselves
now edward sits in shock
colonel brandon give me a parish
can it be possible
the unkindness of your family has made you astonished to find friendship elsewhere
edward looks at elinor his eyes full of growing comprehension
not to find it in you
i cannot be ignorant that to you to your goodness i owe it all
i feel it
i would express it if i could but as you know i am no orator
you are very much mistaken
i assure you that you owe it almost entirely to your own merit i have had no hand in it
but edward clearly believes she has been instrumental in the offer
he frowns slightly before speaking with rather an effort
colonel brandon must be a man of great worth and respect ability
elinor finds some relief in saying at least one thing that she truly means
he is the kindest and best of men
this makes edward seem even more depressed
he sits silent for a moment but then rouses himself to action
may i enquire why the colonel did not tell me himself
i think he felt it would be better coming from
edward looks at elinor his eyes full of sadness
your friendship has been the most important of my life
you will always have it
mr ferrars you honour your promises that is more important than anything else
i wish you both very happy
goodbye miss dashwood
edward leaves silently
elinor stands stock still in the middle of the room
the palmers carriage stands outside the house
colonel brandon helps marianne in beside elinor before mounting his horse to ride alongside
mrs jennings waves goodbye from the steps
the carriage moves off
mrs jennings blows her nose looks up and down the street in search of gossip and goes back indoors with a sigh
marianne is sitting back in her seat with her eyes closed
she does not look well
mr palmer is behind his newspaper
what a stroke of luck for lucy and edward to find a parish so close to barton
you will all be able to meet very often
that will cheer you up miss marianne
i do declare i have never disliked a person so much as i do mr willoughby for your sake
to think we can see his insufferable house from the top of our hill
close on mariannes eyes slowly opening
i shall ask jackson to plant some very tall trees
from behind the paper you will do nothing of the sort
the carriage bowls along with brandon riding next to it
i hear miss greys bridal gown was everything of the finest made in paris no less
i should have liked to see it although i dare say it was a sorry affair scalloped with ruffles but what do the french know about fashion
the carriage stands outside the palmer residence a resplendent affair with a great deal of land
brandon is helping marianne and elinor out of the carriage
i am resolved never to mention mr willoughbys name again and furthermore i shall tell everyone i meet what a good for nothing he is
elinor and marianne stand on the steps as the palmers debauch from the carriage amid a welter of servants
sotto voce i do not think she drew breath from the moment we left london
it is my fault i should have found some other way of getting home
there was no other way you said so yourself
we shall be home soon enough
mamma will comfort you dearest
i am stiff from sitting so long
will you tell charlotte that i am going for a stroll
elinor glances at the sky in concern
i think it is going to rain
no no it will not rain
elinor cannot help but smile at this return of the old you always say that and then it always does
i will keep to the garden near the house
marianne walks off
elinor watches her go anxiously
mrs bunting a rather baleful nanny looks on as mr palmer holds up a screaming baby in a frilly bonnet for everyones inspection
we are very proud of our little thomas colonel and his papa has such a way with him
brandon flicks a glance at mr palmer for whom holding a baby comes as naturally as breathing underwater
marianne walks purposefully towards the garden wall beyond which lies a hill
elinor enters to find charlotte alone with the now hysterical there you are miss dashwood
mr palmer and the colonel have locked themselves up in the billiard room
come and meet little thomas
where is miss marianne
she is taking a little air in the garden
oh very good
that is the great advantage of the countryside all the fresh air and
and all the fresh air
charlottes conversational difficulties are drowned out by her offspring
marianne comes to a gate in the wall and turns the handle
she throws a glance back to the house and passes through
there is a low rumble of thunder
baby thomas is purple in the face but shows no signs of quietening
charlotte joggles him about inefficiently
yelling he is the best child in the world he never cries unless he wants to and then lord there is no stopping him
marianne calm and determined walks towards the top of the hill
the wind whips and plucks at her hair and skirts
elinor traumatised by her new acquaintance with the shrieking baby thomas goes to look out of the window
marianne is nowhere in sight
storm clouds have gathered on the bill
elinor turns from the window
baby thomas stops crying for two seconds
i cannot see marianne
there is a crack of thunder
baby thomas starts again
rain has started to pour down
marianne walks on regardless
charlotte shouts over baby thomas to elinor
she has probably taken shelter in one of the greenhouses
marianne has reached the top
soaked to the skin she stands with the storm raging around her staring at the spires of combe magna the place that would have been her home
rain streaks her face and the wind whips her hair about her
through frozen lips she whispers love is not love which alters when it alteration finds or bends with the remover to remove no
it is an ever fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken
brandon is looking for marianne
he enters a greenhouse
marianne stares at combe magna a strange smile playing about her lips
then she calls to willoughby as though he were near
the effect is eerie unworldly
charlotte mr palmer and elinor are waiting anxiously
baby thomas has been removed
elinor is staring out of the window
one thing is certain she will be wet through when she returns
thank you for pointing that out my dear
do not worry miss dashwood brandon will find her
i think we can all guess where she went
brandon runs up the hillside as though the devil were at his heels
charlotte is handing elinor a cup of tea
elinor turns back to look out of the window
elinors pov of brandon walking up to the house with marianne cradled in his arms
it is like seeing willoughbys ghost
everyone rushes out of the drawing room as the colonel enters with marianne
he is exhausted and soaked
marianne is dumb with cold and fatigue
she is not hurt but we must get her warm
elinor and mr palmer take marianne from brandon and go upstairs with charlotte in pursuit
the great house sits in darkness
a sense of foreboding
elinor is in her nightgown knocking at a door
mr palmer answers in his nightshirt astonished to have been summoned out of bed
i think marianne may need a doctor
mr palmer and charlotte are sitting at the breakfast table
brandon is pacing
the rain has stopped
youll wear yourself out colonel
do not worry
a day or two in bed will soon set her to rights
you can rely upon harris colonel
i have never found a better physician
enter elinor with dr harris
urgent what is your diagnosis
it is an infectious fever that has taken far more serious hold than i would have expected in one so young
i would recommend the hasty removal of your child mr palmer charlotte runs out of the room screaming
charlotte is getting into their carriage with mrs bunting and baby thomas
mr palmer is on the steps with elinor
he takes her hand and looks at her with real sympathy
my dear miss dashwood i am more sorry than i can say
if you would prefer me to stay i am at your service
elinor is touched to find this warm heart beneath his frosty exterior
mr palmer that is very kind
but colonel brandon and dr harris will look after us
thank you for everything you have done
mr palmer nods presses her hand and walks down the steps to the carriage
brandon sits head in hands
his ghosts have come to haunt him
marianne is tossing and turning in the bed
dr harris is trying to take her pulse
he looks up at elinor who is watching anxiously
she is not doing as well as i would like
elinor exits the bedroom to find brandon outside
what can i do
colonel you have done so much already
give me an occupation miss dashwood or i shall run mad
he is dangerously quiet
she would be easier if her mother were here
barton is but eight hours away
if i make no stop you may see us early tomorrow morning
he takes elinors hand and kisses it
in your hands i know she will be safe
brandon mounts his horse turns to look at the house for a moment and then spurs it violently forward
elinor is by the window having watched brandons departure
dr harris is by mariannes side
he turns to elinor
double the number of drops and i will return as soon as i can
the house stands in virtual darkness with only a dim light issuing from one of the upper rooms
brandon riding fast his cape billowing out behind him
mariannes eyes glitter with the fever
elinor wipes her brow
suddenly she speaks
who is that
she is looking at the end of the bed
look look elinor
there is no one there dearest
it is papa
papa has come
elinor looks fearfully towards the end of the bed
marianne tries to smile with her cracked lips
the dead are coming for the dying
elinor her eyes red from watching wipes mariannes temples
dr harris takes her pulse and looks at elinor anxiously
his silence is worse than any utterance
the room is very still
marianne is pale as wax
dr harris puts on his coat
elinor looks at him fearfully
i must fetch more laudanum
i cannot pretend miss dashwood that your sisters condition is not very serious
you must prepare yourself
i will return very shortly
he leaves the room
marianne lies in the grip of her fever
elinor sits watching her
slowly she rises and walks to the bed
when she speaks her tone is very practical
marianne marianne please try suddenly almost unconsciously she starts to heave with dry sobs wrenched out of her full of anguish and heartbreak and all the more painful for being
marianne please try i cannot i cannot do without you
oh please i have tried to bear everything else i will try but please dearest beloved marianne do not leave me alone
she falls to her knees by the bed gulping for breath taking mariannes hand and kissing it again and again
a shimmer of light appears on the rim of the horizon
somewhere a lark breaks into clear untroubled song
dr harris sits slumped in a chair
marianne lies motionless
elinor rises with difficulty from the bedside and goes to the window
she is white as paper
the lark sings
then from behind comes the faintest of whispers
elinor turns with a cry
dr harris springs from his seat and examines marianne
he then turns to elinor with a smile of relief and nods
at that moment the sound of carriage wheels is heard on the gravel
brandon helps mrs dashwood who is weak with exhaustion and distress out of the carriage
elinor hurls herself down the stairs
she reaches the door just as brandon and mrs dashwood enter and practically swoons into her mothers arms
she is out of danger
close on mariannes face as mrs dashwood kisses her
there there my love my marianne
marianne opens her eyes and smiles at her mother
mrs dashwood takes her gently into her arms
marianne suddenly looks anxious
she is too weak to move her head
she whispers with urgent effort
where is elinor
i am here dearest i am here
marianne looks at her with deep relief
behind the dashwoods brandon stands at the door unwilling to intrude on this intimacy
he wipes his eyes and turns away
marianne sees and whispers to him
brandon turns back his eyes full of tears
marianne looks at him for a moment
then very quietly thank you
the cottage nestles in the first buds of spring
a piece of rope hangs down from the branches of a tree in the garden
it starts to wave about wildly and we see margaret emerging and climbing down
she has built herself a new tree house
what though the sea with waves continuall doe eate the earth it is no more at all
marianne is on the sofa by the window
she is pale convalescent and calm
she listens intently as brandon reads her the poem
nor is the earth the lesse or loseth aught
for whatsoever from one place doth fall is with the tide unto another brought
we move back to find mrs dashwood and elinor at the other end of the room sewing peacefully
he certainly is nor so dashing as willoughby but he has a far more pleasing countenance
there was always a something if you remember in willoughbys eyes at times which i did not like
elinor listens patiently as her mother rewrites history
we cut back to brandon as he finishes reading
for there is nothing lost but may be found if sought
he looks up at marianne
a soul breathing glance
she smiles as he closes the book
shall we continue tomorrow
no for i must away
teasing that i cannot tell you
it is a secret
he rises to leave
impulsive but you will not stay away long
close on brandons reaction
elinor and marianne are out on a walk
they go very slowly marianne leaning on elinors arm
their mood is loving companion able
elinor and marianne walk on
suddenly marianne stops
she indicates a spot on the ground but elinor can see nothing and is momentarily alarmed
marianne gazes at the ground and breathes in deeply
there i fell and there i first saw willoughby
he will always regret you
but does it follow that had he chosen me he would have been content
elinor looks at marianne surprised
he would have had a wife he loved but no money and might soon have learned to rank the demands of his pocket book far above the demands of his
elinor regards marianne admiringly
marianne smiles sadly
if his present regrets are half as painful as mine he will suffer enough
do you compare your conduct with his
i compare it with what it ought to have been
i compare it with yours
our situations were very different
my illness has made me consider the past
i saw in my own behaviour nothing but imprudence and worse
i was insolent and unjust to everyone elinor tries to stem the flow but marianne continues
but you you i wronged above all
only i knew your heart and its sorrows but even then i was never a grain more compassionate
i brought my illness upon myself i wanted to destroy myself
and had i succeeded what misery should i have caused you
elinor embraces her
they stand with their arms round one another in silence for a moment
then marianne breaks away and speaks with great good humour and energy
i shall mend my ways
i shall no longer worry others nor torture myself
i am determined to enter on a course of serious study colonel brandon has promised me the run of his library and i shall read at least six hours a
by the end of the year i expect to have improved my learning a very great deal
thomas is sitting on the back of a local wagon holding a basket of food
he jumps off near the cottage and waves a cheery farewell to the driver
close on the accounts book covered in blots and crossed out sums
pull up to reveal marianne labouring over it
her sickness has left her slightly short sighted and she uses a pince nez that makes her look like an owl
elinor is sewing and mrs dashwood is snoozing
margaret goes up and looks over mariannes shoulder
she frowns at the spiders web of ink
youll go blind if youre not careful
betsy brings in coals for the fire
mrs dashwood rouses herself
is thomas back from exeter betsy
yes maam he brung back two lovely fillets for you
mrs dashwood looks nervously at elinor like a child who has been caught out
beef is far less expensive in exeter and anyway they are for marianne
elinor laughs and rolls her eyes to heaven
betsy turns on her way out to remark sixpence a piece miss dashwood
oh and he says mr ferrars is married but i suppose you know that maam
there is a stunned silence
everyone looks at elinor
fetch thomas to us betsy
they all sit very still
margaret is about to talk to elinor about it but marianne stops her
beg pardon miss dashwood but they was the cheapest in the market it was a very good price thomas well done
would you be so kind as to build up the fire a little
relieved yes maam
there is a pause
who told you that mr ferrars was married thomas
thomas builds up the fire as he answers
he tells the story with pleasure
i seen him myself maam and his lady too miss lucy steele as was they were stopping in a chaise at the new london inn
i happened to look up as i passed the chaise and i see it was miss steele
so i took off my hat and she inquired after you maam and all the young ladies especially miss dashwood and bid me i should give you her and mr
ferrarss best compliments and service and how theyd be sure to send you a piece of the cake
was mr ferrars in the carriage with her
yes maam i just seen him leaning back in it but he did not look up
elinor screws up her courage
did but she cannot continue
marianne glances at her compassionately and takes over
did mrs ferrars seem well
yes miss marianne she said how she was vastly contented and since she was always a very affable young lady i made free to wish her joy
thank you thomas
he nods and leaves confused by the silent atmosphere
elinor sits for a moment then gets up and walks out
elinor is standing by the gate looking out
mrs dashwood comes down the path to join her
she links arms with elinor and they stand in silence for a beat
your father once told me not to allow you to neglect yourself
now i find that it is i who have neglected you most
yes i have
we all have
marianne is right
i am very good at hiding
then we must observe you more closely
yes my darling
there is a painful difference between the expectation of an unpleasant event and its final certainty
mrs dashwood squeezes elinors arm tightly
a horse and cart are jogging along
the cart contains a large object tied down and covered with canvas
the driver whistles tunelessly
margaret is standing on the kitchen table while elinor and marianne pin a piece of material around the bottom of her skirt to lengthen it
suddenly there is a commotion upstairs
come and see what is coming
everyone runs out of the kitchen
thomas and the carter are carrying a small piano up the path
they carry the piano into the parlour and to the dashwoods joyful astonishment it fits perfectly
mrs dashwood reads out the letter that has accompanied it
at last i have found a small enough instrument to fir the parlour
i expect to follow it in a day or two by which time i expect you to have learned the enclosed
your devoted friend christopher brandon
mrs dashwood hands marianne the letter and a broadsheet song
he must like you very much marianne
it is not just for me
it is for all of us
all the same she looks conscious of the truth
margaret is up her tree
elinor is pulling weeds
mrs dashwood is sitting on a stool working on margarets dress and listening to the strains of the new song which marianne is singing in the cottage
all of a sudden mrs dashwood rises shielding her eyes with her hand
she walks down to the gate looking out
here is colonel brandon
the piano stops
marianne comes out and they all gather at the gate to watch for the rider
their pov of a horseman in the distance
i do not think it is the colonel
it must be
he said he would arrive today
you must play him the new song marianne
suddenly there is a yell from margarets tree
margaret practically throws herself out of the tree onto the grass
it is edward
the women look at each other in complete consternation
we must be calm
tense silence reigns
everyone tries to busy themselves
mr ferrars for you maam
edward follows her in looking white and agitated
what a pleasure to see you
i hope i find you all well
he bows formally to each of them lingering on elinor who is looking firmly at her lap
he looks anxious
thank you edward we are all very well
there is a pause while they all search for an appropriate remark
finally margaret decides to have a go at polite conversation
we have been enjoying very fine weather
marianne looks at her incredulously
well we have
i am glad of it
the roads were very dry
mrs dashwood decides to bite the bullet
giving him her hand may i wish you great joy edward
he takes her hand somewhat confusedly and accepts her offer of a seat
there is an awful silence
marianne tries to help
i hope you have left mrs ferrars well
tolerably thank you
there is another bone crunching pause
i but edward cannot seem to find any words
is mrs ferrars at the new parish
edward looks extremely confused
no my mother is in town
he plucks up the courage to look at elinor again and is evidently not much comforted by what he sees
i meant to enquire after mrs edward ferrars
then you have not heard the news i think you mean my brother you mean mrs robert ferrars
they all stare at him in shock
mrs robert ferrars
elinor has frozen
edward rises and goes to the window
i received a letter from miss steele or mrs ferrars i should say communicating the
the transfer of her affections to my brother robert
they were much thrown together in london i believe and
and in view of the change in my circumstances i felt it only fair that miss steele be released from our engagement
at any rate they were married last week and are now in plymouth
elinor rises suddenly edward turns and they stand looking at one another
then you are not married
elinor bursts into tears
the shock of this emotional explosion stuns everyone for a second and then marianne makes an executive decision
wordlessly she takes margarets hand and leads her and mrs dashwood out of the room
the three dashwoods come into the garden still holding hands
elinor cannot stop crying
edward comes forward very slowly
i met lucy when i was very young
had i had an active profession i should never have felt such an idle foolish inclination
at norland my behaviour was very wrong
but i convinced myself you felt only friendship for me and it was my heart alone that i was risking
i have come with no expectations
only to profess now that i am at liberty to do so that my heart is and always will be yours
elinor looks at him her face streaked with tears of released emotion of pain and of happiness
marianne and mrs dashwood are stamping about in the garden trying to keep warm
margaret has climbed into her tree house
the branches rustle
hes sitting next to her
margaret come down
will you stop whats happening now
hes kneeling down
mrs dashwood cant help herself
she and marianne look at each other joyfully
the figures of edward and elinor can be seen walking in deep conversation
the lovers walk slowly their heads almost touching their words low and intimate
your mother i suppose will hardly be less angry with robert for marrying lucy
the more so since she settled the money upon him so irrevocably no doubt because she had run out of sons to disinherit
her family fluctuates at an alarming rate
then in london when you told me of the colonels offer i became convinced that you wanted me to marry lucy and that well that you and colonel brandon
me and colonel brandon
i shall not forget attempting to thank him for making it possible for me to marry the woman i did not love while convinced he had designs upon the woman
i did do love
edward stops walking
he looks at elinor and realises he can stand it no longer
would you can you excuse me he takes her face in his hands and kisses her
a group of village children run down the hillside towards the church waving ribbons and dressed in their sunday best
a large wedding party is gathered outside the church
the entire village is present children farmers labourers shopkeepers and all our principals
we see mrs jennings in a gigantic mauve bonnet charlotte and mr palmer sir john mrs dashwood margaret thomas john and fanny who is dressed in a fantastically inappropriate concoction
and some men in regimental uniform
the path to the church is strewn with wild flowers and everyone holds a bunch of their own
the church bells start to peal and a great cheer goes up as the door opens and betsy comes out holding the bridal cake aloft
the bride and groom appear marianne in white lawn and colonel brandon in full uniform
behind them come edward in his parsons garb and on his arm elinor as matron of honour
close on them as they watch the party moving away
marianne and brandon make their way forwards everyone throws their flowers over them whooping and singing
an open carriage decked with bridal wreaths comes to meet them and brandon lifts marianne in
his melancholy air is all but gone and he radiates joyful life and vigour
marianne also looks extremely happy but there is a gravity to her joy that makes her seem much older
according to the custom of the time brandon throws a large handful of six pences into the crowd and the village children jump and dive for them
the coins spin and bounce catching the sun like jewels
one hits fanny in the eye
she reels and falls over backwards into a gorse bush
cam pulls back as the wedding procession makes its glorious way from the church
we draw away into the surrounding countryside
then we see on the far edge of frame very small a man sitting on a white horse watching
it is willoughby
as we draw back further still he slowly pulls the horse around and moves off in the opposite direction
