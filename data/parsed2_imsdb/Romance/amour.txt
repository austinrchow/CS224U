written by michael haneke the hallway is a mess
a window opening onto a light well is open
the door to the apartment is suddenly broken open
a plain clothes detective two uniformed police officers and several firemen also in uniform enter and look around
they all wear gloves and masks that cover their mouths and noses
behind them the superintendent and his wife also push their way in
theyre both holding their noses
in his free hand the superintendent holds a pile of mail and promotional flyers
behind him comes a female neighbor
to the superintendent and the wait outside please
he signals to a police officer who herds the curious onlookers back out through the door
to the superintendent pointing to a pile of mail whats the date of the last letter
the th from what i can see
the plain clothes detective has tried in vain to open the door on the left
it has been sealed up with adhesive tape
to the fire officer can you try
while the firemen go to work on the door the plain clothes detective goes into the adjoining dining room
he opens the windows quickly and turns to go into the room to the left via the double doors
they are locked and the gaps are also taped up
he turns to the right and goes into the living room where he also opens up the windows
the door is open
and comes back into the hallway passing by the waiting firemen
once again we hear snatches of dialogue between the police officer and the janitor
no as far as i know
during the whole time they had a nurse but its been a while since i last saw her
my wife has been
the plain clothes detective enters the bedroom which is now accessible
its windows are open and the draft makes the curtains billow into the room
to the firemen who are now curious enough to come and stand by the did you open the windows
the firemen shake their heads
the plain clothes detective turns toward the big double bed placed against the back wall of the bedroom
on the right hand bed theres only the bare mattress
on the left hand bed lies the partly decomposed body of an old woman
where once there were eyes now there are only gaping holes
the corpse has been neatly dressed and is adorned with flowers that have already dried out a little
on her chest is a crucifix
scene white letters on a black background the credits all we see is the audience pouring into the hall
georges and anne both are around eighty are part of this crowd
they go to their seats in one of the rows near the front
once everybody is seated we hear the usual announcement asking people to turn off their mobile phones
some people caught with their phones switched on hasten to comply
then the lights go out
off screen we hear the soloist make his entrance
throats are cleared here and there
finally the music begins
the music from scene continues
the soloist is surrounded by admirers who congratulate him
now georges and anne push their way into the room
if the soloist is female they will be carrying flowers like most of the others
when the soloist notices their presence he leaves his group of fans heads towards them and greets them very warmly visibly glad to see them
continuation of the music from scene
georges and anne are seated side by side in the half empty bus
anne talks enthusiastically georges says something from time to time and smiles now and then
they are both relaxed and happy
the door to the apartment is unlocked and opened from the outside
the music ends
georges comes in turns on the light
he and anne observe the open door
around the lock one can see the traces of an attempted forced entry
georges bends down and runs his fingers over the deep grooves
they used a screwdriver or something like that
it doesnt look very professional
but who would do something like that
why do people break in
because they want to steal something
laughs briefly out loud hey why not
if i thought about it i could come up with at least three or four people we know whove been burgled
after having examined the outside of the second leaf of the double door he comes in closing the door behind him
what time is it
cant we call the superintendent
ill do that tomorrow morning
anyway they didnt see anything
he unbuttons his overcoat and heads toward the large closet in the hallway
dont let it spoil your good mood now
or the police
come on give me your coat
she goes toward him he takes her coat off and hangs it with his in the closet
imagine if we were here in our beds and someone broke in
why should i imagine that
but its terrible
i think id die of fright
so would i
he undoes his shoes
shall we have a drink
i still fancy a drink
he puts away his shoes with the others and slips on his slippers
anne has gone into the bathroom
go ahead then
mathilde told me that in her building the attic apartment was burgled from the loft
they just knocked a hole in the wall cut out all of the valuable pictures from their frames and disappeared without a trace
he goes toward the kitchen
they must have been professionals
as he passes in front of the bathroom he stops and appears to be looking at anne
did i tell you you looked good tonight
whats got into you
with a gentle laugh georges disappears into the kitchen where he turns on the lights
we hear him fiddling around apparently getting a glass and some wine
after a short werent those semiquavers in the presto incredible
dont you agree
youre proud of him huh
georges wakes up
he looks with amazement beside him then raises his eyes
anne is sitting upright her back against the headboard
after a while the ringing of a kitchen egg timer leads us to the next scene
the egg timer in the kitchen rings
georges is seated in front of the window at a table which is half set for breakfast
he has mobile phone raised to his ear and a phone book opened in front of him
anne is getting up from the table
she goes toward the stove turns off the gas takes the egg out of the pan with a spoon and runs it under cold water
like georges she is still in her robe
on the phone what about next week
no but still it would make sense to get it done soon
it might give people silly ideas
and anyway its too ugly to look at
will you bring the paint with you too to paint over it
but at least some primer
he hangs up
you can depend on that guy
who comes back to the table with the egg i hope so
the last time he kept us waiting for ages if you remember
laughs while acquiescing yes thats true
reacting when she places the egg in his egg cup thanks
if i call a regular professional well still be waiting two months time
more to herself really
she has sat down
looks straight ahead
he cracks open his egg puts salt on it eats
the frodons waited three days when their toilet was blocked
not exactly pleasant
wants to put on more salt but the saltcellar is empty
the saltcellar is empty
he looks up for an instant as if he expected her to deal with it
as she doesnt react he realizes the inappropriateness of such an expectation gets up himself heads for the kitchen cupboards and fills the salt cellar
i dont know if hes going to bring us the cd
maybe he wont come at all
in any case he didnt mention it
id like to buy it
it was really good and i dont want to wait long for it
we could go to virgin this afternoon and buy it
what do you say
he comes back to the table and sits down again
whats the matter
she looks at him and doesnt answer
whats going on
whats the matter
he waves his hand in front of her eyes and laughs nervously
she continues to look at him without reacting
serious now anne
whats going on
he waits looks at her
he stands up slightly leans over the table to sit beside her
tries to make her turn toward him
anne whats the matter
he manages to get her torso to turn halfway toward him but her eyes look through him
he takes her face in both hands and turns toward him
she stares into the void
he drops his hands
then sits beside her for quite awhile
finally he gets up heads for the sink turns on the tap wets a tea towel wrings it out a little comes back and places it on annes face
waits for a reaction that doesnt come
then he pulls up her hair in the nape of her neck and applies the cloth there
then sits down and looks at her imploringly
close to tears anne
once again they both remain seated
in the background we hear the gushing of the tap that in his panic he has forgotten to turn it off
making a sudden decision he gets up rapidly crossing the hallway he goes into the bedroom where he starts to dress agitatedly which takes him quite a lot of time
suddenly the gushing of the tap stops which had accompanied us as far as the bedroom
george doesnt notice it immediately then he stops short
finally he returns half dressed into the kitchen
anne is seated in the same place and looks at him
what are you doing
she turns toward the breakfast
you left the water running
georges stares at her
both aghast and furious hey whats going on
are you completely crazy
is this supposed to be a joke or whats going on
she looks at him with amazement
what did you say
is this a joke
is this meant to be a joke
i dont get it
why are you talking to me like that
whats got into you
georges comes from the door to the table
stop this game
its not funny
what game for christs sake
what on earths the matter
georges is about to answer in a similarly irritated tone but gradually begins to suspect that he could be mistaken
he tries to calm down takes his chair that has remained beside anne sits down and looks at his wife
she doesnt know how to react
whats the matter
why didnt you react
to me to everything
a moment ago
please tell me whats wrong
what am i supposed to have done
georges first looks away reluctantly then looks at anne
he doesnt want to believe that its serious
i dont know what to say
do you really not know what just happened
but what did happen
almost reluctantly bowing his head as he speaks you were sitting there staring at me
you didnt answer me when i asked you what the matter was
he picks up the wet tea towel from the table
i put this tea towel on your face and you didnt react
anne looks at the towel then at georges and shakes her head perturbed that she cant understand
georges looks at her
he sees the damp marks on the collar of her robe
theres still dampness on your collar
anne follows his gesture tugs on her collar and sees the damp marks
she slowly grasps that something is awry
when was it
just now a few minutes ago
theres no so
i went into the bedroom to get dressed
i wanted to get help
yes and then you turned off the tap
because you left it on
i dont understand
neither do i
dont you think its best if i call dr
what can he do
i dont know
theres nothing wrong with me
we cant pretend that nothing happened
but what did happen
im having my breakfast and youre telling me things happened that i dont understand
can you explain how the tea towel got there
no i cant
who turned on the tap
can you remember that
more and more desperate close to tears no i cant
do you want to torture me
leave me in peace
georges looks at her
dont you think it would be better to fetch dr
she takes her cup of tea as if to show how well she is and drinks it up
when she wants to re fill her cup she completely misses her aim
she notices it puts down her cup and bursts into tears
we see wide shots of the apartment
the living room
the dining room
nobody in sight
eva around has come to pay a visit
anne isnt there
you know how he is
once hes got something into his head he has to go through with it
in the end everybody was delighted
and besides it didnt hurt our financial situation
were playing until the th
then we have days to rest then we go to stockholm for four days and then to kumo in finland
heaven knows where that is
at the north pole
but geoffs already been there few times and he loves it
were playing the dowland transcriptions there and then were back in london
what about the children
liz is at boarding school and john is living his own life
hes twenty six years old
what does he do
hes a student
we rarely see him
hes got his own ideas
they dont really get along
geoff wants to advise him on everything and john doesnt like that at all
is he good
i think so
hes less impulsive
that sounds rather derogatory
hes not like geoff
quiet but stubborn
i think hell do all right
at the last conservatory concert he played the solo part in the haydn concerto
it was very good
geoff was there and congratulated him at the end
what do you mean
did you both make up
with a little laugh my god you know him dont you
over the winter he suddenly discovered his passion for a viola player whod been in our ensemble for years
what can i tell you
it was a huge drama and the poor little darling wound up trying to commit suicide
that scared him and he came back to me in full remorse
ive got used to it now
whats a bit embarrassing is that the ensemble you cant keep any secrets from anyone
do you love him
yes i think so
georges gestures that its too complicated
what can i say
the carotid artery was blocked
they did an ultrasound scan two in fact and they said they had to operate on her
she was scared
she was confused and scared
you know she has always been afraid of doctors
they said the risk was very low and that if they didnt operate shed be certain to have a serious stroke
and what do they say now
just that it didnt go well
its one of the that go wrong
its pretty upsetting
he looks at his watch
usually at this time i take a nap
my blood sugar is somewhere down in my socks
im so sorry
what can i do for you
it was nice of you to come despite all of your stress
she doesnt know what to say
theres nothing you can do
well see how things go when shes back here in the apartment
maybe ill get a caretaker in or maybe ill manage on my own
weve been through quite a lot in our time your mother and i
all this is still a bit new
with a little laugh its funny
i dont know if i should say it
maybe itll embarrass you
but when i came here a short while ago i suddenly remembered how i always used to listen to the two of you making love when i was little
for me at the time it was reassuring
it gave me a feeling that you loved each other and that wed always be together
a carpenter and his assistant are raising the base of the double bed
the door of the apartment is opened
georges comes in
behind him is anne in a wheelchair pushed by a paramedic
a second paramedic as young as the first follows with a suitcase and a large bag
behind them the superintendent
georges tries to rid of the three as quickly as possible
he stuffs a twenty euro note into the hand of the first paramedic
thank you very much
its for both of you
you can just put the things down here
there beside the window right
well be okay on our own
thanks a lot
the two paramedics exchange a brief glance say thanks and leave the apartment passing the superintendent as they go
to the superintendent thank you mr
if you need anything just call downstairs
if we can help at all
right now everythings fine
ill let your wife know as soon as we need anything
its nice to have you back mrs
thank you mr
the superintendent hesitates another moment
goodbye then maam
welcome home again
he leaves the apartment
there is a brief moment of perplexity
then georges says with a nervous smile where do you want
in the living room
georges pushes her toward the living room door walks around the wheelchair opens the door comes back behind the wheelchair and pushes anne into the living room
the doorway is narrow
the wheelchair only just passes through it
georges pushes anne toward the sofa and the armchairs and then steps in front of her
shall i make some tea
with a faint smile first come sit with me
george registers her smile he knows hes behaving in a clumsy way
he sits down in one of the two arm chairs
can you help me into the chair
georges stands back up
he extends his hands
she puts on the wheelchair brake lifts the footrest with her left foot raises her right leg from the footrest with her left hand and then extends her left arm
its best if you put my arm around your neck and your right arm around me that way itll be easy
he does as he is told pulls her up as they hobble together the short distance to the second arm chair
cautiously he lowers her down and helps her sit herself straight
because they are not used to it the whole process appears awkward and clumsy
he smiles because it seems silly to him to answer dont mention it
then he sits down opposite her
at first they are both ill at ease but then they accept the fact that words do not come easily
after a long while during which we hear the intermittent sound of the traffic below
softly almost to himself im glad youre back
in a voice just as soft me too
then anne says promise me one thing
please never take me back to the hospital
she looks at him
he has understood
dont talk right now
and dont give me any lectures
what can i say its
just dont say anything
he helps her into bed then throws the blanket over her
thank you darling
you dont have to hold my hand all the time now
i can look after myself you know
and dont feel guilty
that would be pointless
and a drag
for me too
i dont feel guilty
go over there now
im not a cripple
you can easily leave me alone for two minutes
i wont collapse
with a slight smile did you buy the new book on harnoncourt
ive already read it
do you want it
ill get it for you
he goes out of the room to fetch the book
she remains lying there waiting and runs her healthy left hand through her hair to make herself look prettier then smooths out the blanket that has slipped out of place
after a while we hear georges shouting
i dont know where i put it
it isnt that important
yes it is
hold on maybe its in the
just a moment
here you are
nothing like an infallible memory
she smiles looks in his direction
he enters with the book in his hand
i thought id left it over there in the other room but id already put it away
tidy people just cant help being tidy
taking the book thanks
she puts the book on her stomach
looks at georges
right now take care of yourself
and dont wait to see how i hold the book in my hand ok
he looks at her for a moment longer then leaves the bedroom
she waits till hes outside
tries to relax
then she remembers the book
she takes it in her left hand and tries to open it
its not easy for her
then she notices that shes forgotten her glasses
she rests the book back on the bed cover and fishes for her glasses on the night stand
in the end she manages it
then she opens the book again and tries to read
the superintendents wife puts the filled supermarket bags on the counter
takes the stack of mail that she had put on top of one of the bags and puts it down beside them
then she takes out the receipt and the change
unfortunately the strawberries were already moldy
ill go and get you some fresh ones tomorrow from the market
my husband will bring you the bottled water this afternoon
im not supposed to carry anything heavy my back you know
sure no problem
it came to euros and cents
theres the till receipt and heres your change euros
thank you very much
keep the change
thank you sir
short embarrassed pause
well ill be off
call me if you need anything else
is your wife well
yes shes ok
give her my regards
my husband and i are very glad shes back
yes we are too
mery thanks so much
she heads toward the front door of the apartment turns around again toward georges
ill bring you the strawberries tomorrow around noon if that suits you
he nods she closes the door as she leaves
he stands in front of the closed door of the toilet waiting
after a while we hear the noise of flushing
after a while longer we hear there
can you come in please
he opens the toilet door goes around anne pulls her up she puts her left arm around his neck keeps herself upright that way he pulls up her pants under
then they slowly hobble out of the toilet and he sits her back down in the wheelchair
they are both lying in their beds
anne sleeps breathing noisily
georges lies with his eyes open listening attentively to her breathing
the sun shines in
georges has cooked something simple
they are both in a good mood eating and drinking
some banal romance or other about a nobleman and a lower middle class girl who couldnt have each other and who then out of sheer magnanimity decide to renounce their
love in fact i dont quite remember it any more
in any case afterwards i was thoroughly distraught and it took me a bit of time to calm down
in the courtyard of the house where grandma lived there was a young guy at the window who asked me where id been
he was a couple of years older than me a braggart who of course really impressed me
to the movies i said because i was proud that my grandma had given me the money to go all alone to the cinema
what did you see
i started to tell him the story of the movie and as i did all the emotion came back
i didnt want to cry in front of the boy but it was impossible there i was crying out loud in the courtyard and i told him the whole drama
to the bitter end
how did he react
he probably found it amusing
i dont remember
i dont remember the film either
but i remember the feeling
that i was ashamed of crying but that telling him the story made all my feelings and tears come back almost more powerfully than when i was actually watching the
film and that i just couldnt stop
she looks at him smiles then turns back to her food
why didnt you ever tell me before
there are still a few stories you dont know
dont tell me youre going to ruin your image in your old age
you bet i wont
but what is my image
she takes a mouthful eats ponderously
then she looks at him
sometimes youre a rotter
but youre nice
can i take you for a drink
he does physiotherapy exercises with her
counts the repetitive movements of the exercises
shes lying on the sofa
hes seated in the armchair
theyre both reading the newspaper
after a while listen to this
motto you have lots of verve but need to be more serious
love high class conversation is what you need
work youre motivated again
but proceed with care
health loosen up by doing exercises
itll give you renewed pizzazz
then youve only yourself to blame if you read stuff like that
then tomorrow afternoon is pierres funeral
you have to go
i fear i must
i dont want to go at all
who does like going to funerals
oh i know a few people who do
annette can never wait to get all dolled up again
and francois has
what would you say if no one came to your funeral
dryly nothing presumably
she shoots him a glance smiles at his irony
then she says have you talked to jeanne since i was in the hospital
i mean does she know i cant come
what did she say
she was shocked
a bit irritated my god what are people like when theyre shocked
she couldnt believe it she was speechless
i dont remember any more
in any case not exactly
ive spoken to a lot of people since
no im sorry
i didnt mean to be unkind but i just dont see the point of talking about it all the time
do i talk about it all the time
the front door is unlocked from the outside and georges enters
hes back from the funeral dressed for the occasion
he turns on the light
clearly its been raining
as he closes the door again his eyes fall on anne
with her back to him she is sitting on the floor in front of the opened window of the light well half propped against her wheelchair
shaken he heads toward her picks her up and seats her in the wheelchair
outside in the light well it is raining
once shes seated in the why are you back already
what time is it
georges has understood immediately
he closes the window noiselessly
then just stands there at a loss
then forgive me i was too slow
can you wheel me into the living room
he turns toward her pushes the wheelchair into the living room between the two armchairs
turns on the light
stops beside the switch
they both look exhausted
youre always good at surprises
why are you home earlier
i didnt come home earlier
i took a taxi
in august there isnt a lot of traffic
how was the funeral
how was it go on tell me
he thinks an instant then goes and sits down facing her in an armchair
looks at her
she raises her head and returns his look
he understands that he cant insist right now
then he begins it was rather bizarre
the priest was an idiot
then one of pierres co workers made a speech that was embarrassingly emotional
his old secretary came with a radio cassette player and after the speech she put on yesterday by the beatles
you cant imagine
everybody turned round to look at her
apparently it wasnt planned
his grandchildren were there
of course they giggled as soon as the music began
then the urn was put on a huge stretcher that was obviously designed for a coffin and out we went into the rain
they placed the urn on a small electric cart that crawled along for what seemed like an eternity to the tiny hole they had dug
a lot of people had to stifle their laughter
it must have been terrible for jeanne
theres just no point in going on living
i know it can only get worse
why should i inflict it on us
on you and me
youre not inflicting anything on me
you dont have to lie georges
imagine you were me
didnt you ever think something like this could happen to one of us
of course i did
but imagination and reality have little in common
but things are getting better every day
georges i dont want to carry on
youre making such efforts to make everything easier for me
but i dont want to go on
for my own sake
i dont believe you
i know you
you think youre a burden on me
but what if things were the other way around
what would you do then
i dont know
i cant be bothered to think about being you
you tire me
everything tires me
i cant talk
i want to go to bed
he looks at her
finally he gets up and pushes her wheelchair out of frame
she is lying in bed
the bedside lamp is on
we hear the radio coming from the living room a program about the fauna and flora of the south seas or something similar
georges comes out of the kitchen and opens the front door
on the doorstep stands the soloist male or female from scenes and
somewhat perplexed but pleased oh hello
nice to see you
forgive me for dropping in on you like this professor
i tried to reach you by phone a couple of times but no luck
i only pick up the phone when ive stored the callers number and i can see whos calling
why didnt you leave a message
anyway do come in
he closes the door behind his guest
i just couldnt manage to come by after the concert
i was so sorry because i was so pleased you came along
come with me
while they pass into the living room they continue to speak and now an unexpected opportunity has arisen because francois mitry called me you know him hes my agent to
say hed arranged for me to meet the boss of the theatre des champs elysees tonight to talk about their new concert series
so i flew to paris this morning and while i was in my hotel i thought ill just give it a try and drop in
after all its virtually just around the corner
sorry these are for your wife
he takes the bouquet of flowers from its wrapping paper and hands it to georges
isnt she at home
yes she is
ill go and get her in a minute
have a seat
i hope im not disturbing you too much
no not at all
im happy that you came
we were so thrilled by your concert
we hoped wed see you again soon
please do have a seat
can i can get you something
a cup of tea
no no thank you very much
hold on ill just freshen up the flowers in this heat they wilt so fast
ive only just bought them
they should keep quite
but georges has already left the room with the bouquet and closed the door behind him
the soloist looks around him
after a few moments we hear the voices of anne and georges in the distance without understanding what theyre saying
it lasts a while
finally georges opens the door and pushes anne in her wheelchair into the living room
what a delight
how lovely to see you
the male or female soloist has got up and doesnt quite know how to handle the situation
lovely to see you too
dont get up
come on sit yourself down and dont look so shocked
the soloist sits down hesitantly georges pushes the wheelchair between the two armchairs and also sits down
brief embarrassed pause
im so proud of you
we were both in raptures after your concert
georges wanted to buy your new cd the very next morning
i wanted to bring you the cd but i left in such a hurry that i forgot it
im so sorry
ill get one today and drop it by
no no dont worry
we want to make a contribution to your success
even if its only twenty euros
youve already contributed so much
i owe you so much madame
you owe it to your hard work and your talent
shaking his head a little do you remember when you first gave me the bagatelles to play
i was twelve at the time and in my youthful arrogance i said but why the bagatelles
and you really gave me a piece of your mind
they both smile
then he goes on so what happened
my right side is paralyzed thats all
it can happen when you get older
lets talk about something else shall we
dont be offended
but i want to enjoy the lovely interlude youve given us with your visit
you havent told us yet whats been going on since the paris concert
the soloist is a bit thrown by the couples behavior
well actually ive spent most of the time in london studying
then i went to copenhagen for two performances that was schubert too
my whole life revolves around schubert at the moment
the concerts with the impromptus and the moments musicaux and for my bread and butter work im developing the sonatas
not the late ones i think i still need a couple more years for those
the dialogue concerning music will be modified according to the performer chosen
could you do me a favor
would you play fur elise
um i dont know if i remember it very well
beethoven its been a long time since ive
but if you want
give it a try
he looks at georges then at anne again gets up goes to the grand piano and plays
georges is leaning against the chest and watches anne who is practicing maneuvering her new electric wheelchair
forward backward turning
in the end she goes round and round in circles several times
he laughs so does she
anne is lying in bed
a book rests on her stomach
she listens to the piano playing coming from the living room
after a while the music stops
whats the matter
georges is seated in front of the open piano
his hands in his lap he looks straight ahead
the superintendents wife runs the vacuum cleaner over a carpet
anne is seated on a stool
georges washes her
georges has cooked himself a steak and is eating
on the radio we hear the evening news
suddenly coming from the neighboring room a loud crash and the sound of crockery breaking
stifled cry from anne
georges gets up irritated crosses the hallway and enters the bedroom
anne lies on the floor beside the overturned night stand in the midst of the crockery and remains of a meal
shocked and hence furious good god what are you doing
he hurries toward her and pulls her up rather roughly into the bed
have you lost your senses
i dont believe it
he points to the broken objects
look at that
did you need to do that
cant you call me when you need something
meekly im sorry
yes so am i
georges bends down and begins to gather up the scattered objects
the lamp is broken too
georges in pajama pants naked torso brushes his teeth
the doorbell rings
georges spits out wipes his mouth goes into the hallway and over to the front door
georges is very irritated
anne calls to georges
whats going on
who is it
georges opens the door
outside however instead of the usual landing we see an empty room lit a giorno but without a window about as large as the rooms in the apartment
it looks like an unpainted room in a new apartment
a couple of ladders are propped against the opposite wall
at the other end of the room to the side is a small door
georges is stunned and doesnt understand what has happened
hesitating he crosses the room toward the door
in the distance annes worried voice georges
whats going on
georges opens the small door
behind it is a narrow windowless corridor as brightly lit as the room
at the end of the corridor a door
georges heads toward this door and opens it too
behind it is a tiny windowless room equally bright as the others
everything is very quiet
georges enters turns round then goes back along the corridor crosses the room comes through the apartment door into the hallway of the apartment
but it too is now empty and bright with bare unpainted walls no doors only the door to the bedroom is open
behind that too it appears to be empty and bright
georges goes toward it
at the same time we hear georges voice
at first he groans but then begins inarticulately hollering louder and louder
shortly after we also hear georges whats going on
calm down will you
theres nothing there
she manages to switch on the bedside lamp
georges is sitting up in his bed having just awoken wide eyed with terror
his breathing is labored
anne extends her good hand toward him caresses his back to calm him
he slowly calms down and flops back on his pillow
what was it
he doesnt answer
continues breathing heavily
she caresses him
still with labored breathing i didnt understand
i thought id gone mad
it was something impossible
close shot on the screen of a cell phone
we read on it coming to paris on th
plan to stop by in afternoon
hope all well
so look forward to seeing you
we hear o
the voice of eva
theyre coming on the th
he crouches down in front of anne who is seated on the bed puts his mobile phone back in his pocket and continues to put on her socks and her
apparently shes coming with geoff
when is it
i dont know exactly
what day is it today
ill go and look
i dont want that
geoff doesnt need to come
georges doesnt agree but continues to dress anne
i dont need any comments on my predicament
i can only take his british humor in small doses
once more the set of physiotherapy exercises
things are going better
georges smiles encouragingly at anne noticing her improvement
she reacts like someone duty bound but without conviction
close shot a cd is inserted into a player
as the music begins the concert heard in scene georges takes a card out of the envelope that contained the cd and reads it to dear madame laurent dear monsieur
laurent it was beautiful and yet sad to see you
my heartfelt wishes that things will get better
with deep gratitude your former pupil martin
the music makes their silence less awkward
then after a long while anne says stop the cd
he hesitates looks at her then stops the music
suddenly anne says where are the family albums
the family albums
i dont know there in the other room
can you get them for me
id like to look at them
georges hesitates and doesnt understand the suddenness of this request
he finally gets up and goes into the adjoining room
he comes back after a few moments with a stack of albums pushes away the remains of annes meal and sets down the first album in front of her
a bit irritated youre welcome
with her able hand anne opens the album looks at the photos turns the pages looks
self consciously softly what
what a long life
georges looks at her
she continues to thumb through the pages
after a while she turns toward him
stop watching me
caught in the act i wasnt watching you
of course you were
im not that dumb yet
they are both lying in bed
georges reads the days news to anne from the newspaper
when he looks over to her she has fallen asleep
he then puts the newspaper on the night stand and turns out the light
georges is helping anne to get out of bed into her wheelchair
as he does it he notices that the bed and her nightgown are wet
youre soaked through
what do you mean
he sits her back on the bed and goes out of the room
ill be right back
during this time she remains seated feeling embarrassed and waits
he comes back with a towel and puts it on the seat of the wheelchair
its no big deal
he lifts her out of the bed into the wheelchair and pushes her through the hallway into the bathroom
he lifts her out of the wheelchair sits her on the stool and takes off her wet nightgown pulling it over her head
she starts to sob inconsolably
he caresses her face
come on darling
its nothing serious
things like that happen
take it any more
he holds her tightly against him strokes her hair feeling helpless
anne is in bed
shes on a drip
eva is seated on a chair beside the bed
thinking about whether it wouldnt be better to invest the money in an apartment block
if inflation gets going again property is the only sure thing
right now savings accounts pay
four years ago geoff bought some stocks with a small sum of money and the whole thing collapsed
so now were obviously worried
unfortunately in the meantime other people have had the same idea and property prices are going through the roof
since we came back from scandinavia i spend all my spare time looking through newspaper ads
to put an end to the pause that follows she adds it takes time thats all
well find something in the end
another oppressive pause
slowly yes yes i have
woman with house
the house then money i dont understand you im afraid
in two strokes of
god its hard
eva has tears in her eyes
georges and evas husband geoff around fifty
he speaks with a british accent
three times a week
im not experienced enough
well see if thats enough
how much is she asking
its paid by the hour
its hard to say
sometimes i get the feeling shes totally unaware of the state shes in
and then i feel the opposite
i dont know
and what about the doctor
what does he say
eva comes in through the door
shes in floods of tears
she only talks gibberish
i dont know what
geoff gets up hesitantly
he goes toward her and leads her to the armchair where he was sitting
come here sit down its ok
she shakes him off irritated and sits down
nothing is ok
at first hes vexed by her brusque response but then goes to sit down on the sofa
meanwhile eva turns to georges whats going on actually
you cant just leave her lying on her bed like that
we cant do anything for the moment
calm down darling
shes getting medical treatment they give her the necessary medication and there are no other options right now
what does that mean no other options
why isnt she in a hospital
she had a second stroke
bertier examined her and felt we could spare her all the hospital inpatient procedures
anyway they wouldnt keep her theyd send her to a care home
what they do in those places we can do here
eva looks at him amazed
and she wont be put in a care home
i promised her that
dont you think youre taking on too much
have you got a better idea
geoff doesnt know what to say
eva has composed herself somewhat and blows her nose
i cant believe that these days theres no way of handling this efficiently
no ones stopping you from finding out
eva gets up furious and goes to the window
georges follows her with his eyes
believe me i love your mother as much as you do
so please dont treat me as if i was a total idiot incapable of doing the obvious
i didnt say that
im simply questioning whether what i see going on here is the answer to everything
dont you want to get a second opinion
now you two had better stop ok
another doctor did come
he said bertier was right
from monday a nurse will come three times a week
now can we talk about something else
georges washes the tea cups that he used for eva and geoff
on the radio the evening news
with expert gestures a nurse shows georges how to lie anne down and put an incontinence pad on her
shes now almost incapable of moving and has to be turned over like an object as tears flow silently down her face
anne is at the piano and plays the piece from the scene
we watch her and listen to her for a while
georges is seated in his armchair and looks at the piano
finally he leans over toward the cd player and stops it
the music suddenly stops
georges remains silently seated
he prepares a bowl of muesli fills a sipping cup with water and brings both into the bedroom
sits down on the bed close to anne to feed her her food
there my love i hope you like it
he begins to feed her
i added a little orange juice
i find it tastes quite good
she can only swallow slowly and so something keeps running back out of her mouth
he wipes it with a tea towel continues to feed her
finally after a few mouthfuls she keeps her mouth shut
come on anne you have to eat some more
youve only swallowed three mouthfuls
anne continues to keep her lips sealed
a bit more
anne doesnt move
he puts the muesli on the night stand and holds the sipping cup to her lips
she drinks slowly one sip after the other
he pulls the cup back between each sip to give her more time
suddenly she says mom to the concert
mom to the concert
mom has no dress for the concert
mom to concert
georges and the nurse install anne on a metal armchair in the shower
as she does so the nurse keeps talking reassuringly to anne
finally she turns on the tap
in a monotone help
without being phased the nurse continues to speak reassuringly
georges remains standing there helpless
georges and the nurse are seated at the table with a cup of coffee
in front of the nurse on the table is a sum of money
as they speak we hear coming from the room annes we could take turns
shed come from till and id do until or to
that would certainly relieve the pressure on you
ill think about it
she just has to know in time so she can arrange it in her schedule
yes of course ill let you know in the next few days
i have to go now
she takes the money on the table pockets it and gets up
thanks for the coffee
ill see you out
they both leave the kitchen
as the nurse in the hallway takes her jacket off the hook in the closet and puts it on she comments on annes continuing calls for help
you mustnt take it too seriously
usually they always say something
she might just as well say mom mom mom
its just mechanical
nodding softly i know
theyve reached the door
he closes the door behind her
remains motionless a moment then goes into the bedroom where annes calls for help unaltered continue
georges sits down beside anne on the bed takes her hand holds her
after a while anne calms down her calls for help become quieter and finally stop altogether
after a long pause slowly softly id like to hire a second nurse
the two could take turns
that would make everything a bit simpler
what do you think
they are both lying in bed
georges snores noisily
annes eyes are open
the front door
we hear the key in the lock
georges enters with a shopping bag and behind him is the superintendent
he carries bigger and heavier bags
georges holds the door open for him
would you mind putting them in the kitchen
the superintendent precedes him into the kitchen with the bags
georges calls toward the bedroom im ba aack
he then follows the superintendent into the kitchen
the superintendent has put the bags on the work surface
thanks very much
can i do anything else for you sir
no thanks mr
youve been a big help
oh its nothing sir
georges has already taken out his wallet and gives some money to the superintendent
thanks a lot sir
ill let you know if i need you again
with pleasure sir
he gets ready to leave
he stops again in the doorway and turns around
may i say something sir
what is it
my wife and i were very impressed by the way youre managing everything
i take my hat off to you
as he speaks georges mobile phone has started to ring
taking the mobile phone from the pocket of his jacket thats very kind of you
see you soon
give my regards to your wife
i certainly will
as the superintendent leaves the apartment georges looks at the display on his mobile phone and makes a call
hello eva how are you
things are fine
georges standing at the foot of the bed faces anne and starts singing
sur le pont
sur le pont
sss sur le pont
sur le pont
ssssur le pont
smiling to encourage her
sur le pont davignon
sur le pont davignon
he begins to sing sur le pont davignon on y danse on y danse sur le pont davignon tout le monde y danse en rond
he encourages her to sing with him
starts singing again sur le pont d avignon on y danse on y danse
anne tries to sing too she has a hint of a smile on her face but she produces only isolated sounds
singing to encourage anne accompanied by the sounds that she produces sur le pont davignon on y danse on y danse
sur le pont davignon tout le monde y danse en rond
a second nurse is doing annes hair roughly
the brush sticks in her tangled hair
there we are
now were all beautiful again
so everybody will admire us
she takes a mirror that she has placed within reach
holds it in front of annes face
what do we say to that
arent we a pretty sight
anne sickened averts her eyes
emits a muffled sound
the nurse ignores it
youll see monsieur will be dazzled by you
furious sound from anne
the window opening onto the light well is open
a pigeon has landed on the window ledge
it walks to and fro then finally dares to jump down inside onto the floor
it starts to explore the surroundings
we hear the toilet flush
georges comes out of the toilet
the door opening frightens the pigeon
alarmed flapping its wings it flutters about the room
after a moment of surprise georges tries to shoo it back toward the window
but the bird escapes in the opposite direction
george follows it
he closes the doors of the other rooms
coming from the bedroom we faintly hear annes voice
georges fetches a towel from the bathroom
he chases the bird
he hits out at the bird for so long that it escapes back out through the window
georges visibly exhausted has to sit down on the chest in the hallway
georges and the second nurse
as you wish sir
i dont know what you were expecting
i gave up another job to come and work here
you should have thought it over before deciding whether you wanted a second nurse or not
but ive only just found out how incompetent you are
whats that supposed to mean
i dont want to discuss it with you
anyway you wouldnt understand
no one has ever complained
good for you
to get rid of her how much do i owe you
after a brief calculation seven hundred and eighty euros
georges takes his wallet from his jacket hanging on the armchair and takes out eight one hundred euro bills
the nurse is hopping mad
ive never had anything like this happen to me before
who do you think you are
ive been doing this job for ten years
i dont need you to teach me how to do it
do you have twenty euros
the nurse takes out her purse angrily looks inside
then take the eight hundred euros
you can go now
the nurse pockets the money
youre a nasty old man
i feel sorry for you
georges has put back his wallet turns to her again and looks at her
i hope from the bottom of my heart that one day someone treats you the way you treat your patients and that you too will have no way of defending
now get out
she looks at him at first doesnt know what to answer then go fuck yourself you old fart
she leaves slamming the door behind her
a few seconds later we hear the front door of the apartment fall shut
georges sits down in his armchair looks straight ahead
then he lights a cigarette his hands shake he smokes
he tries to pour some tea into her mouth with the sipping cup
she wont loosen her lips
please open your mouth
he sits upright
if you dont drink youll die
indecipherable sound from anne
is that what you want
she looks at him
he bends over her again presents the cup in front of her sealed lips
come on anne please
she doesnt react
he opens her lips with his fingers and tries carefully but using some force to separate her teeth
pours a little tea in
the liquid runs out of her mouth
he puts down the cup takes a towel and wipes the liquid some of which has run down onto the pillow
he tries to mop it up
she watches him the whole time
finally he puts the towel down beside the cup and looks at her
tries not to show his helplessness and his anger
you cant force me to let you die of thirst
if you persist ill call bertier and hell put you in hospital
they can force feed you there
is that what you want
i promised to spare you that
but you must help me
im out of my depth
he takes the cup again and puts it against her lips
her lips remain sealed
he presses the cup hard against them
drink that now
it hurts her so she opens her mouth and lets in a little liquid
she closes her mouth again and he puts down the cup
then she spits it all out like a fountain
after a moment of bewilderment he slaps her
hes frightened by his own gesture
then he puts down the cup and sits on the chair beside the bed
they dont look at each other
please forgive me
the various paintings hanging in the apartment
without their frames
like views on various realities
sometimes the remote sound of traffic in the distance
georges is drinking tea and reading the newspaper
suddenly the doorbell rings
georges annoyed puts down his newspaper gets up goes into the hallway and goes to the front door
a bit irritated yes
georges panicked thinks for a few seconds
just a minute
he goes toward the bedroom door locks it and puts the key in his pocket
he goes into the dining room also closes the door leading to the bedroom
he comes back
he is about to go toward the front door but remains motionless an instant opens the door of the toilet that is located just nearby flushes the toilet closes the
toilet door again and opens the front door
a brief kiss hello
what was going on
i was in the toilet
he closes the front door behind eva indicates the direction of the living room
eva points to the bedroom with a questioning look
he shakes his head as if to play down the question and indicates back in the direction of the living room as if to say you understand huh
eva is slightly irritated but follows him into the living room
he closes the door
why this unannounced visit
where have you come from
whats going on with mom
what should be going on
gesture toward the dont you want to sit down first
eva wants to answer but finally gives in and sits down
georges does the same
so why are you in paris
whats going on with mom
why dont you answer the phone
after our last conversation i left four messages on your answering machine
why dont you call back
i didnt listen to it
dont you realize were worried
your worries are no use to me
eva glares at him
no dont get me wrong
im not criticizing you
i just dont have the time to deal with your worries thats all
lets stop this conversation right there
im taking care of your mother
its a full time job
and im not saying that to complain just to explain why i didnt answer your phone calls and why i dont want to have any pointless discussions on the subject
your mother is just as could have been expected bad the whole time
she is turning more and more into a helpless child and its sad and humiliating for her and for me
and she doesnt want to be seen in that state either
even the last time you visited she didnt want you to come
you two have your own life
nothing wrong with that
but let us have our life too
even though its a lousy one
dad whats the matter
nothings the matter your visit caught me by surprise
and im annoyed that you show up here to check that everythings ok
who do you think you are
eva is speechless
then she gets up and makes to go to the door
stay here will you
she stops short looks at him
softly but insistently please
she hesitates a moment but winds up leaving the living room
georges remains seated motionless until she comes back
she seems upset by the situation as one would expect
tell me whats going on
have you gone crazy
please sit down
i dont want to sit down
whats going on here
nothings going on
i want to spare us all a pointless drama
i presume your mother is asleep
she mostly sleeps the whole day
and then she wakes up at night
if you really want to well go and see her in a little while
now sit down
they look at each other
reluctantly eva heads toward her armchair and sits down
then georges goes on in a quiet voice we do our speech exercises every day or we sing together
most of the time i wake up around
at that time shes still awake
then we change her incontinence pad
i rub cream on her to avoid sores
then around i try to persuade her to eat and drink
sometimes it works sometimes not
sometimes she tells me things from her childhood then for hours she calls for help and then an instant later shes giggling away to herself or crying
nothing of any of that is worth showing to anyone
eva looks down
finally she says you cant stop me from seeing her
they remain seated for a moment finally eva gets up
georges follows her into the hallway
he unlocks the door and they enter the bedroom
the bright light from outside filters through the blinds
eva goes over to the bed looks at anne
finally she caresses her face shyly and clumsily
anne opens her eyes
looks at her
its me mom
anne emits a furious sound
can i do something for you
georges has remained by the door
after a while they both leave the bedroom cross the hallway to come back in the living room
georges closes the door
for an instant he puts a consoling hand on evas shoulder
then he sits down
eva trying to compose herself goes toward the window and looks outside
suddenly she starts sobbing
after a while georges gets up and goes out of the room
eva vexed blows her nose
shortly after georges comes back
he has another teacup in his hand puts it down beside his on the table and sits down
the tea isnt very hot any more
eva turns toward him
but it does make you feel better
after a short pause eva comes toward the table
he fills her cup
she takes the cup drinks
still cant bring herself to look at him
it was silly of me to lock the door
you took me by surprise thats all
she nods her head indicating she understands
finally she looks at him whats going to happen now
with a little ironic laugh whats going to happen now
the nurse comes twice a week and every two weeks dr
bertier and the hairdresser come
thats what you want to know right
things will go on as they have done up until now
theyll go from bad to worse
things will go on and then one day it will all be over
you cant go on like this dad
what do you suggest
cant we have a serious talk you and me
what do you call a serious talk
what do you want to suggest
do you want to have mom live with you
do you want to pack her off to a care home
what do you want
go on talk to me seriously
eva looks at him
georges is seated on the bed beside anne who is still bedridden
in a rush
with a small gesture to imitate a bell ding
yes it swung to and fro
she imitates a serious countenance continues in a low voice like that
unable to keep from laughing a little yes
i think i was pretty uptight
anne puts her hand on georges
it was n
georges is shaving
suddenly we hear coming from the bedroom loud help
georges wipes his face and to the sound of annes cries crosses the hallway and enters the bedroom
anne continues to cry out in a monotone to herself
georges goes over to her bed
trying to calm her like a sick child what is it
are you in pain
whats the matter
is your pad full
he raises her blanket for an instant and sniffs then replaces it
so whats hurting you
he sits down beside her on the bed
takes her hand
its all right
its all right
hold on ill tell you a story
but you must be quiet i cant talk too loud it wears me out
here we go when i was little
well i wasnt as little as all that
it was toward the end of primary school so i was about ten dad and mom sent me to a holiday camp
they thought it would do me good to spend the summer with kids my own age
we were lodged in an old castle in the midst of a magnificent wooded landscape
i think it was in the auvergne
i dont know
in any case it was the opposite of what id expected
we had to get up at and go for a morning swim
not far from the castle there was a pond fed by an icy mountain stream
we entered it running in a double file
you know i was never very sporty
they had a program to keep us on the go all day probably to nip any potential pubescent impulses in the bud
but the worst thing was the food
the third day after our arrival there was rice pudding for lunch
i hate rice pudding
we sat at long tables in a huge hall
i didnt want to eat the stuff and the housemaster said to me you wont get up until youve cleared your plate
so after the meal everybody left the room and i remained seated in tears
i had made a secret pact with mom
i was to send her a postcard every week
if i was pleased with the place i was to draw some flowers on it or if not some stars
she kept the card it was covered all over in stars
after three hours i was allowed to leave the table
i went up to my room got into bed and had a fever of degrees
it was diphtheria
they took me to the nearest hospital where i was put in an isolation ward which meant that mom when she came to visit me could only wave at me
through a window
at some point i lost that postcard
its a pity
anne has become ever calmer during georges story
he still holds her hand
then georges reaches across annes body to get hold of his pillow and presses it over her face
stifled sounds from anne
everything that can still move in her body starts to move
georges presses down heavily on the pillow lies on it with his whole weight for a long time until all annes movements stop
then he sits up exhausted and without removing the pillow from her face remains seated beside her
the front door of the apartment is unlocked
georges in city clothes enters with two big shopping bags full of cut flowers
he puts down the bags takes off his coat hangs it in the closet
the telephone rings
georges takes the bags and carries them in the kitchen puts them in the sink fills it with water
he starts to cut the stems and put the flowers in the water
we watch him doing so for a while
meanwhile the telephone georges has opened one of the sections of the large wall closet
he is looking for a specific dress
he takes some out puts them back inside
one of the dresses slips off its hanger and falls to the floor
he picks it up hangs it up again
he ends up finding the one he was looking for
he takes it out on its hanger
closes the closet again
looks at the dress
then he lowers his arm a little and is about to leave the bedroom
he catches his feet in the dress
he just saves himself from tripping up by grabbing on to the wheelchair that is parked there
exhausted he flops down into it
with wide adhesive tape georges seals up the door frame of the bedroom
georges is seated at the kitchen table where he had breakfast with anne in scene and writes a letter
pauses for reflection
gentle cooing of pigeons scarcely audible
suddenly georges starts
at the far end of the long kitchen beside the door between the kitchen units a pigeon is walking
georges stares at it
for a long time
then he gets up slowly and via the door located beside the kitchen table he goes into the adjoining room
on the sofa there he has set up his new bed
he takes the wool blanket from the bed and comes back into the kitchen carefully approaches the pigeon that then runs off in alarm
georges carefully opens up the blanket and finally throws it over the pigeon
but it manages to escape into the hallway
georges follows it
this action is repeated several times
the pigeon is more and more panicky starts to fly up flutters about in all directions
georges closes the light well window to cut off its escape route
this lasts an exhausting amount of time but he ends up capturing it
he cuddles it against him rolled up in the blanket leans against a wall then holds it as if it were a baby
from the adjoining room we see georges seated at the kitchen table writing
finally we see what he is writing you wont believe it
a pigeon came in for the second time already through the light well
this time i caught it
in fact it wasnt difficult at all
but i set it free again
im going to
georges is lying on his bed in the adjoining room staring at the ceiling
we faintly hear the sound of running water and from time to time the clattering of dishes
after a while georges gets up and goes into the kitchen
he remains in the doorway and watches anne who doing the dishes at first doesnt pay attention to him then notices his presence and shoots him a quick glance saying
casually im almost done
georges continues to look at her unwaveringly
you can put your shoes on if you want
georges looks at her an instant longer passes beside her goes into the hallway sits down on a stool beside the closet and puts on his shoes
we hear anne finishing her work
she comes out hangs up her apron in the closet disappears for a few moments into the bathroom
meanwhile georges has got up and looks in the bathroom where clearly anne is tidying her hair and sprucing herself up
when she comes out again he takes her coat from the closet and helps her put it on
they head for the front door
arent you taking a coat
georges thinks a few seconds then takes his trench coat from the hook and they leave the apartment
four long shots all the windows are open
the sun is shining
it is fairly bright
then the sound of a lock being opened
eva comes into the apartment
remains a long time beside the door
looks around her ill at ease
finally she hesitantly goes into the bedroom
annes twin bed isnt there any more
on georges bed lies only the bare mattress
eva remains there a moment then goes through the partition door into the dining room
there everything is as usual
eva continues into the living room
there too everything is as usual
eva stops by the piano stool
looks out of the window feeling at a loss
then she heads toward the sofa and armchairs in the corner
on the table lie the remains of a snack
eva looks at the table turns again toward the open windows through which we hear street noise
then she sits down exhausted in one of the armchairs
her diminutive frame seems lost in the big room
