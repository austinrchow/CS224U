screenplay by roger hedden based on a play by roger hedden the camera looks down on three levels of escalators transporting a smattering of southwestern shoppers some in cowboy hats
a series of angles of shoppers being conveyed up and down
a beautiful vista cacti and sage dot the landscape as it rises to mountains in the distance
the camera pans revealing an island of modern culture malls and more malls parking lots and fast food franchises
a brown pinto pulls out of a parking lot and into rush hour traffic
beth walker is driving
she looks younger but shes twenty eight
she has a strong face and flashing intelligent eyes
shes wearing a waitress uniform from friendlys
shes deep in thought
beth pulls up to stoplight and stops
sound a gentle toot of car horn
beth looks up startled
sid a pleasant looking twenty four year old is in a pick up truck next to her
he smiles and points up toward the traffic light
she looks up toward the traffic light
theyre red except for one with a lit green arrow
she pantomimes that shes in the wrong lane and wants to go straight
sid pantomimes that hell let her cut in front of him
sound horns honk impatiently
beth pulls away in front of the pick up truck
the honking continues
sid looks back at the honking car cheerfully waves to it
a tiny well kept spanish style home in lower middle class residential section
its neat and smartly furnished discount swedish modern framed deco posters some nice plants
the only problem is it seems a little more like a well designed waiting room than a home
theres an empty ice bucket several empty liquor bottles and a swinging metal ball thingabobby on a chrome and glass coffee table in front of leather sofa
carol and nick are curled up together on the sofa drinks in hand
theyre both in their late twenties
carols dressed in the casually stylish clothes worn by women who work in shopping mall boutiques
nicks clothes are frumpled a knit tie loose around his neck
theyve achieved a state of contemplative drunkenness
carol sips her drink
nick sips his drink
carol sips her drink
nick brings his glass to his lips hesitates
flatly were moving
enunciating were going to move
after a beat when
in two days
carol shakes her head in weary disbelief
covering her hurt thanks for the news
she knocks back her drink
i havent known for long
i just decided
ruminating what do i need that makes me make these decisions
carol stares at him
he knocks back his drink
you got me
she pours herself another drink
what does beth say
she stops at an intersection
whatever makes me happy
thats what she says
headlights flash from behind her
she turns and looks
sids smiling from his truck right behind her
he flashes his lights again
beth looks up in the rearview mirror amused
sid turns off disappearing into the night
surprised to find herself vaguely disappointed she drives on
its small prefab and tidy
it has a counter with shutters that open onto the living room
nick is kneeling going through bottles in a cabinet
w drunken desperation i know this place
nick stands with an almost empty bottle of johnny walker red
i know what happens here
he pours himself a drink
carol shuts the cabinet
i know whats going to happen
nick opens a cabinet under the sink and tosses the empty bottle in the trash
he begins to pace
carol shuts the cabinet and follows him with her gaze
as nick speaks he gestures grandly with his drink liquor splashing unnoticed over the sides
bursting with frustration the same job same scenery same people
ive been in this town for years
flatly three years
in despair oh carol
he stops and slugs back his drink
forever it seems forever
beth pulls up to a stoplight her face blank with thought
shes suddenly lit by the flash of headlights going on and off
she looks up and smiles
sids pick up truck is facing her across the intersection
it slowly pulls up beside her and stops
he smiles and gives a little wave of his hand
without knowing why she smiles and waves back
sweetly but firmly good bye
she drives away
sid stares after her
carol lifts the end metal ball on the thingabobby and releases it starting the chain reaction
she stares at it clacking back and forth as she speaks
how long a drive is it
thats not bad
in a car
its a fuckin nightmare
carol stops the metal ball
she releases two balls starting a new chain reaction
griping and theres no radio in utah
its all religious programs
nick slumps on the sofa beside her
flatly no thanks
think about this
you take a detour and go through vegas you and beth stop see a show have a nice romantic dinner play the slots get the free drinks
interrupting too much money
then the hotel thats another hundred down the toilet
as carol speaks she pokes at nick
he fends off her blows
by the end of her speech she is on top of him mock strangling him
jabbing nick no you skip the hotel
its night the highways empty you can make good time
you start speeding
you get stopped in utah by the cops you flunk the breathalizer they haul you in
the judge is mormon you get fifteen years you go to prison but at least your life has taken a direction
nick and carol collapse into laughter
the front door opens
calling in im here
beth steps in
carol quickly lets go of nicks neck and gets off him
embarrassed they both smile self consciously
theres an awkward instant followed by too much cheerfulness
stands in the doorway awkwardly conscious of having interrupted something
w forced cheer hi
nick and beth are standing in the lawn lit by the glow of the porch lamp
both sides of the street are lined with nearly identical tiny faux spanish houses
calling out pizza hut tomorrow
to beth ive got the short shift you want me to come over help pack
im really sorry we didnt tell you sooner
he just decided
smiles to herself a trace of sadness in her eyes
she shuts the door
she starts to walk across the lawn
she stops and stares at nick whos staring out into the night oblivious to her
im going to bed
he turns and looks at her
whats your problem
i havent got a problem
he walks up to her and past her when she doesnt fall into step he stops
you agreed to try billings
in nicks words billings montana
city of the future
yeah and i read that a while ago so the futures probably already there
she smiles and shakes her head
defensively its not like youre leaving anything behind
a good job or something
just some friends
he puts his arms around her waist from behind and nestles her against his body
youll make new friends
after a beat im not eight years old
i know ill make new friends
then what is it
she pulls away from him and starts walking to the house next door
he falls into step with her
uncomfortably i umm
it embarrasses me
when you talk about something with carol that happened before me
shes my best friend
it embarrasses me that you used to live with her
that was years ago
and were moving
she wont be your best friend anymore
they arrive at their front door
beth takes out her keys
nick stops her hand and kisses her
she kisses him back
living with someone isnt such a big deal
she nods and looks to the lock
i live with you now
beth looks to nick
he stares out at the night
the coffee maker clock hits nine oclock
the coffee maker clicks on with a rattle
steam starts to spew out
the coffee maker makes horrible gurgling sounds
the kitchen is small and a little grimy its furnishings fatigued
nick stares at the coffee maker in disbelief
hes dressed in a dress shirt untied necktie and slacks
hes carrying a sportscoat with a sears employee name tag attached
calling out beth
beth walks into the kitchen wearing a robe and carrying the paper
nick points accusingly at the coffee maker as water pours down from around its top
it does that
she drops the paper on the kitchen table and gets a mug off the counter
since we got it
pouring herself a cup lately
throwing his jacket on a chair shit
agitated whats wrong with it
water comes out
unplugging the coffee maker i hate this shit
it never kept the coffee hot
and now this
he angrily wraps the cord around the coffee maker
blowing on her coffee it still works
water comes out
she sips her coffee
she flips open a box of dunkin donuts
i couldve gotten a new one
on my discount
now its too late
do you want a donut
i want an appliance that works
beth shrugs and takes a donut out of the box
she leans against the counter eating the donut
nick walks past beth and jams the coffee maker into the trash
this coffee maker was junk
nick pushes a button on the blender
it makes a horrible grinding whine
he unplugs it
this blenders junk
he jams the blender into the trash
i dont know why were even bothering to pack
through a mouthful of donut you got me
gets no channels
and its fifteen inch
shaking his head i cant believe we dont have a big t
we dont watch much
but at our age
they stare at each other
nick picks the almost full pint bottle of scotch off the counter and puts it in his jacket pocket
beth takes another donut
why dont you take one
im not hungry
offhandedly not a donut
take a t
its your last day
like a bonus
beth is holding a donut and her coffee mug
nick tosses his jacket into the front seat of his old sedan
i might do it
i say do it
after a beat sears can afford to give you a bonus
maybe they are
what do you mean
maybe when i get my check today therell be a bonus in it
they fired you
flatly theres no bonus
shaking his head and i sold a lot of teevees for them
beth sips her coffee waiting for nick to decide
calmly you should take a t
nick looks at his watch
i should go
sarcastically dont wanna be late on my last day
he kisses beth surprising her
he presses against her
he takes the donut from her hand and takes a bite
beth kisses nick his mouth still full of donut
he kisses her fully then breaks the kiss
i gotta go
about hundred cars dot the vast parking lot
nick swings into a parking spot and gets out of the car
he tosses his jacket on the roof and crouches tieing his necktie using the cars outside mirror
you livin in your car or what
chip a big redheaded guy in his late thirties wearing a jacket and tie is grinning at the crouched nick
nicks reflection grins back
just waiting for the last second to put on the noose
tightening the tie so chip whats new
nick straightens up and grabs his jacket
they start walking toward the mall
broaching the subject i heard youre leaving
im outta here
they approach the employees entrance
they can you
thats what they think
i was gonna quit anyway this way i get unemployment
nick opens the door
chip enters this way im not stuck waiting around for the lay offs to start
nick follows chip in
a hint of panic lay offs
the door shuts behind him
the front page of the phoenix sun times the headline reads misery index soars
beths hand comes into frame and crumples the page
beth stuffs the paper in a glass and wraps the glass in another piece
shes sitting on the floor surrounded by dishes newspaper and cardboard liquor boxes
she adds the wrapped glass to a box
she hears the sound of a car door slamming looks up then returns to her packing
she reaches behind herself into the trash pulls out the blender and begins to wrap it
at the sound of the front door opening followed by a curious metallic clunking she stands and hurries through the swinging door to the living room
the living room is sparsely furnished a sofa a coffee table a bookcase cluttered with a handful of paperbooks a couple of boardgames a dying cactus etc
a crappy old fifteen inch t
on a t
we see this for a moment before
a paint splattered cloth is unfurled filling the screen
it gently floats down revealing a painter and his shopping cart overloaded with supplies
hes dressed in paint splattered clothes
a paint splattered red sox cap is pulled low over his eyes obscuring his face
beth stares in disbelief
without seeing her the painter backs up his attention focused on spreading the dropcloth
who are you
not looking up the painter
agitated what are you doing
the painter looks up from the drop cloth ready to deal with this obstacle
his face lights up
extremely pleased well good morning
recognizing him you
extending a hand sid
nice to see you again
beth stares in agitated disbelief
with his untaken extended hand he pulls a long strip of masking tape from a roll around his wrist masking one side of the door frame from top to bottom
why are you here
realty office likes a fresh coat between tenants
pointedly were still here
he stands on his tiptoes and puts a strip of masking tape on the top edge of the doorframe
ive done this house before
admiringly i did a nice job
he masks the remaining side of the door frame
cant you come back tomorrow
the new people move in on sunday
conversationally where are you moving to
wearily billings montana
sid moves to a window
it cant be worse than enfield arizona
sid pulls a strip of tape off the roll
smiling ive lived in enfield my whole life
he holds out the end of the masking tape
could you hold this
beth takes it
he walks backwards easing a long strip of tape off the roll
i use this to mask
have you ever used masking tape to mask
he tears the tape off the roll and sticks it to the top of the baseboard in one corner
crouched he waddles across the room toward beth applying the masking tape to the baseboard
he gets to beth stands up takes the tape off her fingers and presses it into place
a house like this its real easy
hardly needs a paint job
you can skip it
i wont tell
it needs a fresh coat
he hands her the end of the tape again and begins another baseboard
a little color
naturally curious what color is it gonna be
he goes along the floor pressing the masking tape to the baseboard
its already off white
its just dirty
beth looks at the walls
now if it was my house i would choose a color
beth kneels down holding the tape as he arrives at her end of the wall
i would not choose off white
beth holds out the tape
they are kneeling next to each other
what would you choose
the color of your eyes
pause without looking hazel
beth stares at sid
sid looks to beth
smiling he takes the tape from her fingers
an oasis in the center of a packed mall parking lot
carol hurries toward the front entrance in a snappy skirt and blazer combo a bullocks name tag attached to her lapel
nick is sitting at a booth a beer in front of him lost in thought
carol arrives drops a gift wrapped box on the table and scoots into the booth
sorry im late the new girls a moron
looking to the present whats that
going away present
nick takes it
he quickly unwraps it
happily a map
i thought you might need it
unfolding it i do
i had a map i lost it
he spreads the map out over the table
organized lets highlight your route
of the western half of the u
fills the frame
carols hand holding a bright red felt tip pen enters frame
she circles it
nicks finger enters frame
carol circles billings
nicks finger starts to trace the route
carols pen follows marking the route
halfway to billings nicks finger abruptly stops
carol stops the pen at the same point
look at this right there thats the town i was born in
he looks to her for a reaction
emphatically where i grew up
where my parents live
isnt that a coincidence
shaking his head oh
youre going to be driving by
shaking his head theyre not near the interstate
sort of chagrined i havent even called them in years
you might as well visit
shrugging i wouldnt know them
nick starts to fold the map very unsuccessfully
nick hands her the map
she deftly folds it in one motion and hands it back to him
he leans over the table and kisses her
two of the walls gleam with fresh paint
sid is painting with long handled roller
beth enters hesitates and then consciously ignoring him walks by with a packed box and adds it to the stack by the front door
im lucky i dont have to kill them
not a line she was expecting what
if they were dark id have to put a layer of kill down first
beth starts back to the kitchen
sid and the camera follow
so the dark paint wouldnt shine through the off white
the dishes are mostly packed
she picks up two empty liquor boxes
kills an oil based paint
beth carries the boxes out of the kitchen sid and the beth walks right on through followed by the talking sid and it covers the old paint so that youd
never know it was there but it gives off fumes when its drying
beth goes into the small hallway sid and the camera follow
beth walks toward the bedroom sid right behind her
they would find us on the floor unconscious
they enter the bedroom the camera following
theres a queen sized bed a bureau a mirror and a closet
beth takes the boxes to the closet
sid sits on the bed checking its firmness
the they that find people
after a beat the man i live with
smiling i guess hed be the they
hed find us
and hed be surprised
sid gets off the bed and with a grin gingerly pats out the wrinkles hes made in the bed spread
nick and carol are walking away from the pizza hut across a huge parking lot toward a large mall
cars circle past them searching for close spots
doggedly it was the drive that killed us
san antonio to seattle is just too many hours in a car
if wed have flown we wouldve made it
shaking her head no
things were all right in bed
but the rest of the time they were
we couldnt stand each other
we stopped in enfield and just stayed
after a beat why didnt you go on to seattle
it was your car
on her face the answer to his question is clear she was stuck on nick then and shes still stuck on him now
but shed never let him know that
dryly big trees scare me
she starts walking
nick hurries up beside her
they walk side by side for a few paces before the shotdown nick comes up with a new ploy to win favor
casually im thinking about stealing a t
beths taking extra sheets and towels from the linen closet and packing them in liquor boxes
sid enters from the living room
cheerfully im done in there
i wont paint the ceiling til youve moved the furniture out
i dont think were going to take much of the furniture
i kind of like the sofa
its a sofa bed
youre not going to take it
flatly it weighs two thousand pounds
can i have it
the furniture is kind of ugly but the walls look great
the whole room seems brighter almost magically more cheerful
sid runs into the room and flops onto the sofa
he settles in and sighs contentedly
the front door bursts open
sid leaps up
carol races into the room
excited nicks gonna steal a t
she sees sid and freezes
who are you
beth hurries into the living room
excitedly hes really gonna do it
he says yes
carol glances pointedly at sid then returns her attention to beth
conspiratorilly weve got to talk
piping in about the crime
sharply theres no crime
nicks gonna steal a t
thats just an expression
ive never heard that expression
witheringly its making the rounds
college students use it
to beth wheres he stealing it from
incredulous you want him to know
he doesnt care
to sid do you care
enthusiastically im interested
i read the papers
its not a crime
they fired him
deducing hes got motive
exasperated who is this guy
he holds out a hand to shake
carol stares at his outstretched hand
point blank no
carol takes beth by the arm and leads her away from sid
she stares back over her shoulder at sid
taking the hint he begins to stir a can of paint assuming an air of indifference
carol turns her attention back to beth
purposefully he needs you at the store
tinged w apprehension he needs me
nick is standing next to rory a precocious eight year old boy whos staring at a soap opera on a big screen t
as nick and rory talk the soap actor and actress passionately embrace
you lookin or buyin
i hate television
what do you like
shaking his head no
laying it out you see
you go to a movie youre there
rory listens attentively
you watch t
youre thirteen places at once
as many channels as you get thats as many places as you are
you get cable
youre forty places at once
you get a satellite dish
youre all over the world
in the background on the big screen t
the soap actress breaks the embrace and points a gun at the actor
the soap actress shoots the actor
he stares at her in overacting disbelief and slumps to the floor
its called freedom
carol watches as sid whistles cheerfully ripping the long strips of masking tape off the trim
w attitude this is what you do
i also mow lawns
which is your career
im an inside person
confidentially mowing grass is seasonal
dryly that is true
sid wads the tape into a big ball
disarmingly youve got a nice tan
not disarmed i work on it
sid shoots the tape ball into his shopping cart of supplies
do you want to get stoned
carol thinks for a moment
its been a long time and shes not crazy about him being there
after a beat yeah
sid takes a joint out of his shirt pocket
this kind of painting for people i wont know its boring
lighting the joint its not very good
he takes a drag
but itll get you fucked up
he hands the joint to carol
takes a drag on the joint like an old pro
itll take you someplace
carol chokes back wheezes and then explodes in a coughing fit
nick and major jenkins a uniformed military man in his late forties are standing in front of a wall of silent color televisions
on the t
s a nearly identical pairs of local anchors smile their way through the news
have you thought about american
i own an american set
im very satisfied
i want japanese
ill tell you
nick put his arm around the mans shoulder and guides him toward a display case
the thing is a hundred and fifty dollars gets you very little in the way of japanese technology
they stop at the case
it would get you that t
a tiny two inch casio television playing gilligans island
nick looks to see the jenkins reaction
jenkins stares dumbfounded at the tiny t
he looks to nick
its for my parents
they live with me
beth enters the frame
nick doesnt see her
and they want japanese
nick stifles a strange urge to giggle
beth tries to subtly get nicks attention
is there a problem
controlling the giggles no
i uh just never think of adults as having parents
flatly they do
agreeably i know
beth fake coughs to get his attention
nick sees her
im an adult i have parents
nick turns to beth with a burst of salesman cheer
oh miss ive got your receipt
beth approaches them still not sure what nicks up to
acting cheerful oh
nick holds out the receipt
this is all you need
beth takes the receipt
puzzled but playing along thanks
personably now you just take this receipt out give it to the guys at the loading dock and theyll give you your brand new beautiful television set
thrown i get the t
cheerfully out back
theyll help load it in your car and everything
flatly i get the t
nick turns his full attention to the man
think about american
theyre mostly japanese parts anyway
beth stares at nick amazed that hes managed to come up with a plan that has her taking the television
excuse me i just
interrupting pleasantly miss
im helping this customer here perhaps you might
firmly a salesmans put off you might want to see someone else
pointedly you cant help me
after a beat then w finality not really
beth rides down on the escalator the receipt clenched in her hand surrounded by other shoppers as a tinny muzak version of the theme from the mary tyler moore show
drones on in the background
conflicting emotions cloud her face
howd you do it
nick sold a demo wrote it up like a new set and gave me the receipt
as sids jacknife enters frame and zips through the packing tape the camera pulls back to reveal
the sun is low giving the room a golden glow
sid and beth are sitting on the sofa the t
box on the floor in front of them
sid opens the television box
slowly he pulls out the sheets of bubbled packing plastic
he pops several of the bubbles
savoring the bubble plastic excellent
maybe i should just leave it packed
you stole it
you gotta see it
hold the box
beth holds the box
sid starts to lift out the television
beth looks to him anxiously
i thought i heard the police
beth listens nervously
ha ha ha
an amused realization youre stoned
youre being silly and youve got bunny eyes
embarrassed sid pulls visine from a pocket and drips it in his eyes as he speaks
im a little stoned
not that stoned
after a beat carols really stoned
you got carol stoned
i didnt think she liked you
but she likes getting stoned
smiling she does
theres nothing like drugs to create a quick and shallow friendship
rubbing his hands lets look at the loot
sid pulls the t
up and out of the box
he sits back on the sofa the t
in his lap
is spectacular huge metallic and ultra modern
very impressed jesus
you didnt fool around
w mixed emotions this is the nicest thing ive ever owned
beth stares at the television
sid stares at beth
she meets his eyes then looks quickly back to the television
nick is driving
his face is beaded with sweat as he drags heavily on a cigarette
he pushes the buttons on his radio getting news broadcasts
and in canton ohio today a man opened fire in a mall killing nine and wounding seventeen others
initial reports indicate the young man was a disgruntled employee
nick turns the radio off
he pulls the scotch bottle from his jacket and takes a slug
he jerks his necktie loose and slips it over his head
he tosses it into the back seat
swerves into a vast mall parking lot
through the flow of traffic we see nick standing at a payphone on the outside wall of a red lobster restaurant
nick speaks urgently into the phone punctuating his conversation with edgy body language
abruptly he hangs up
carol hangs up a wallphone
she leans against the refridgerator her expression a controlled blank
she turns her head and looks out her kitchen window
through nick and beths living room window we see sid struggling under the weight of the t
as beth laughingly gestures where she wants it
beth and sid are kneeling on the floor in front of the t
playing on the t
a rock video featuring girls guitars and the endless highway
its a beautiful picture
sid takes the remote from beth and turns the volume up very loud
enthusiastically nice speakers
carol enters through the front door unseen by the mesmerized t
w happy disbelief fuckin nick
sid and beth stare at the television completely engrossed
carol stares at them for a long moment
over the din dryly hi kids
startled sid and beth jump back
they look at each other and laugh
cheerfully come see
beth turns the volume down as carol comes and looks at the t
impressed i should have had him steal me one too
you can come over and watch
carol looks to beth a quizzical expression on her face
to beth quietly youre moving
w a tinge of sadness oh
to carol sorry
beth turns off the t
theres a moment of awkward silence as they all stare at the blank screen
breaking the silence pointedly hows the painting going
shaking his head too many distractions
ill be at it all night
you have bad work habits
not when im actually working
standing i better get set up in the kitchen
he goes to his shopping cart of supplies
carol and beth stare at the television
the television stares back at them gleamingly modern
it makes teevee seem very futuristic
at the kitchen door thats cause youre stoned
im hardly stoned
she looks to beth
beth is grinning
mitigating it was homegrown
teasing want some visine
calling out it gets the red out
the visine comes flying into frame
carol fumbles then catches it
dryly thank you
carol tilts back her head and manuevers the visine
missed the eye got the face
beth goes to her and takes the visine
holding carols arm tilt your head back
she puts a drop in one eye
wait a second
carol blinks and wipes a visine tear off her cheek
nodding to the kitchen in a conspiratorial whisper he really wants to get in your pants
smiling my pants are taken
she tilts carols head back
why dont you go for him
he likes you
beth puts a drop in carols eye
carol flinches and rubs her eye
i wish nick would get back and help with the packing
she sighs cheerfully exasperated
hes probably getting drunk with the stockboys
after a beat thats what hes probably doing
carol braces herself
pause then w difficulty listen
they stare into each others eyes
after a long moment carol averts her eyes and looks down
simply hes gone
badly shaken whered he call from
he said the highway
beth takes a deep breath controlling her emotions
i have to do something
ive got to be out of here sunday
you can come to my place
stunned hes gone
beth sinks onto the arm of the sofa to support herself
gently hes an asshole
the truth makes its way deeply into her
a half whisper fuckin nick
the lightly traveled highway cuts a straight line through the desert
nicks sedan pulls off into a service station with a giant teepee beside it
the wind is roaring kicking up swirls of grey dust in the flourescent light of the service station
a teenage navajo boy is filling nicks tank
nick leans against the car staring at the giant teepee
nobody lives in that right
but it closed at seven
cheerfully shrugging i got no one to shop for
a gust of wind sends dust into nicks eye
rubbing his eye fuckin wind
sincerely what does it mean
high pressure field coming in should bring some nice weather
the wind itself you know what i mean youre an indian
correcting him im a navajo
yeah so youre in tune with this stuff
checking the pump its thirteen bucks
his train of thought broken oh
nick pulls a bill out of his wallet and holds it out
heres a twenty
the navajo teen takes the bill and takes a wad of bills from his pocket
nick stares out at the moonlit desert and the mountains rising in the distance
so what does the wind mean
like as an omen or something you know making his voice mystical a change is coming to the people
the spirit of freedom is walking the land
flatly that kind of meaning
handing him money fourteen fifteen and five makes twenty
he opens nicks car door for him
the wind is
its the wind like im a navajo
the navajo teen nods
he gets in the car his mood darkening and pulls his door shut with a slam
out the window it would be better if meant something
the navajo teen shrugs
nick starts the engine
a dimly lit room filled with raucous customers and lots of neon beer signs
waitresses in red dresses tote pitchers of brew to the thirsty throng
at the far end a band plays a foot stompin good time tune about a trucker on his way to see his woman
the camera moves through the crowd and discovers carol and beth sitting at a small table an almost finished pitcher of beer between them
they speak loudly to be heard over the din
he said he needs to be alone again
learn about himself
make a fresh start in a new town
beth shakes her head then takes a sip of her beer it tastes bitter in her mouth and she puts her glass down in disgust
after a beat hes sorry
beth stares at her beer
carol puts a hand comfortingly on beths arm
he said he would have called you but your phones disconnected
cause youre moving
after a beat hes always been an asshole
after a beat youll be all right
gently im here
i know that
a big haired waitress approaches the table
you ready for another
carol looks to beth
is nick coming in
carol throws the waitress a look that could kill
beth takes a deep breath
nick stares at the road ahead
he takes rapid drags on a cigarette
the radio is barely audible over the roar of the wind through the open windows
covered by static and he arose and came to his father but when he was still a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and
nick turns the radio off
he fumbles the cigarette into the ashtray
he takes a pint of scotch from the front seat uncaps it takes a slug takes another slug recaps it and drops it back on the seat
he stares at the road
he looks down to the front seat and finds the map
he splits his attention between the road and unfolding the map
the wind catches the map
the map billows up covering his face
losing control of the car nick slaps it down
a car horn blares
nick jerks the car back into his lane bats the map down again and pulls off to the side of the road
he stops the car and slams the shift into park
he opens his door a crack turning on the dome light
he smooths out the map on the dashboard
billings and enfield are marked with carols big red circles
nicks finger traces from enfield toward billings along the route carol highlighted with the red felt tip
halfway to billings the red line stops
nicks finger stops
he stares at the map
beth comes in the front door
the sound of sid whistling comes softly from the kitchen
beth stares at the t
for a moment then strides purposefully toward the kitchen
sid is standing on the counter masking the top sill of the kitchen window
theres half a donut hanging from his mouth
beth comes through the swinging door
forcefully youve lived here your whole life
the half donut falls from the startled sids mouth
after a beat yeah
increduously youve never gone anywhere
he picks up the half donut
travelling has no allure for me
sid climbs down and sits on the counter dropping the half donut back into the donut box
maybe through time
smiling thats not offered
so i stay here
the simple truth its my home
i belong here
so was sid but he realizes beth doesnt believe it can be as simple as that
my father says if you stay in one place long enough your luck knows where to find you
wryly maybe thats my problem
carefully maybe it is
sid holds out the box of donuts to her
she takes a donut and fiddles with it
you think your father knows the truth
hes a bartender
smiling hes lived here his whole life
has his luck found him
after a beat but its probably very close
beth smiles weakly
abruptly she drops her donut back in the box
cautiously are you all right
apologetically must be the paint fumes
she opens up the back door and steps out
sid stares at the empty doorway
beth stands in the moonlight staring out at the stars
contemplatively dubious you find what you want here
sid steps out behind her
it seems that way
simply i found you
she walks out into the backyard
sid follows her
earnestly we never met before last night
the moonlight through the orange trees casts a magical air about the backyard
beth stops by a swingset
but we know each other
she walks away from him
he watches her intently
leave it behind
she looks to him
leave what behind
amused that was a bad answer
it was true
beth stares at sid
come hold me
after a beat come hold me and youll be happy
dryly ill find happiness
in your arms
but i wont
i have to find happiness in myself
going toward her people tell you that but its wrong
she turns away from him
he stands behind her close
ive lived with people who have that happiness from within
that happiness its just them being pleased with themselves
its not enough
its a lonely thing
she turns and faces him
the moonlight casts a pale glow over them
she stares in his eyes for a long moment
she steps back from him
youre showing how young you are
im showing you a way
you know that
and you know me
after a beat and i know you
she walks away from him back to the swingset
i dont know you
sid follows and takes her arms turning her to face him
after a beat defensively i know you want to fuck me
he pulls her very close
he lets go of her arms so she is standing against him unrestrained
is that what you know
beth stares at his face for a long time
she kisses him suddenly long and slow
whispering i know you
they kiss pulling each other tight
they lose their balance and stagger against the swingset kissing passionately
beth pulls back
w fierce intensity i know you
a canopy of stars hangs over it
nick is parked staring at the house
the roadmap is on the seat beside him
he takes a drink from a half empty pint of scotch
he screws the cap on and drops the bottle on the map
he steps out of the car unsteadily
nick walks toward the door
he stops stares at the door and starts back for his car
he stops shakes his head and walks quickly to the front door
nick stands staring at the door
he waits impatiently then pounds on the door
on his third pound the lights in the house suddenly go on
the door abruptly opens
august an eighty year old man stands in the doorway
he wears pajamas slippers and a long robe
he is over six and a half feet tall
nick startled steps back
august stares at him
nick composes himself
august stares at him
im looking for my parents
august calmly puts his hands over his ears and slowly shakes his head
my mother my father
elizabeth a fifteen year old girl steps out from behind mr
she seems very small next to mr
he puts a hand on her shoulder
she stares at nick
exhaling in relief oh
to the point this is my house
mean this is the house i grew up in
nick looks past them into the house
nodding to mr
august this is his house now
nice to meet you
he holds out a hand to mr
august who slowly shakes it
loudly nice to meet you
hes stone deaf
uncomfortably yelling doesnt help
nick breaks the handshake
august smiles at him
nick looks to elizabeth
my name is nick nick brennan
he waits for her to introduce herself
did you know the brennans
they lived here
they used to live here
i used to live here with them
elizabeth stares at him
nick tries his salesman charm
whats your name
i know an elizabeth
quietly i call her beth
bathed in moonlight sid and beth make tender passionate love
sid has never wanted someone so much and beth has never felt so wanted
beth clings to sid as if she were afraid of being swept away
and then she is
a chandelier casts a gently sparkling golden glow
the camera tilts down to reveal
august elizabeth and nick sitting at a large antique dining room table
nick is eating a sandwich an untouched glass of milk in front of him
august and elizabeth watch him expectantly
nick notices this
swallowing this is a good sandwich
abruptly nodding toward mr
august when did he move here
would he know where the people before him went
he wouldnt remember
he doesnt remember anymore
taking a deep breath he cant help me
nick looks around the familiar room struck by the absurdity of the situation
with wry awareness ive lost my parents
nick smiles weakly at elizabeth
matter or factly did you lose them both at the same time
is that like a joke
i lost them both at the same time
i lost mine one at a time
after a beat last year
nick realizes shes talking about death
interrupting six months apart
separate body failures
im really sorry
standing i should go
august slowly stands as elizabeth follows nick toward the foyer
first my fathers heart kept starting and stopping
nick edges toward the door followed by elizabeth and mr
my mother and i were with him in the hospital and hed grab at us hed grab my arms and hold on
thats very sad
after a beat backing toward the door ive really gotta be going
thank you again for the sandwich
right before my mother died she said elizabeth
nick stops in his tracks his hand on the doorknob
have you found your real parents
two are enough to lose
nick stares at her the sad truth of her statement sinking in
im not alone
i have my grandfather
nick looks down
he is alone
he has no one
opening the door listen
he looks into her eyes
elizabeth suddenly grabs his arm
he stares at her not knowing what to do
she holds his arm tightly for a moment then lets go
she steps back from nick against her grandfather
in explanation hes stone deaf
nick stares at elizabeth
i have to go
and he hurries out the door into the night
beth is sitting up in bed sid leaning back against her her arms wrapped around him
after a beat id like to stay right here
i have to be out tomorrow
in this moment
enjoying this moment
they both lie perfectly still
a flicker of sadness crosses beths face
hushed the moments gone
shaking his head it can go on as long as we want
beth leans him back cradling him in her arms
she stares at him a quizzical expression on her face
skeptically have you ever been in a relationship
after a beat i was married
but it wasnt really a relationship
incredulous you werent married
right out of high school
beth ponders this for a moment
do i remind you of her
relieved thank god
sid runs his hands over her body
you have beautiful skin
her skin was polka dotted
when we were kids we called her spot
laughing what happened
beth looks to sid
hes staring off
after a beat was she ever found
a flicker of loss crosses his face
not by me
looking to beth i didnt go look
beth stares at him uncertainly
he leans up and gently traces circles on beths skin
she wanted to meet someone new
i asked her why
she said because he wont know me from before
just what i am now
beth looks to him puzzled
i knew her
in sunday school
all those grades i knew her as she changed
but she was still the same person
all the times i knew her she was still her
after a beat she cant get away from that
he holds beth tightly
you stay in one place and all those things that are you
she didnt understand that if you leave theyre still there in you but they stop being clear
you stop knowing who you are and what you want
youve stayed here and you know who you are
he moves away from beth
i see the lawns i mow houses ive painted faces i know
and im constantly reminded of who i am
and you know what you want
i want you
i want to be inside you
after a beat come here and put it inside me
i want to be able to put myself inside of you
doing this is as close as you get
beth pulls sid close bringing him into her
i love you
she holds him tightly
come inside me
sid arches away from her
what do you want
uncertainly i want
beth pulls sid back to her
w quiet urgency come inside me
they hold each other tightly
nick looks like hell his eyes red his hair a mess
the nearly empty scotch bottle is on the dashboard
the car windows are open the roar of the wind competing with the blasting radio
nick suddenly jerks the wheel over
the sedan screeches off the highway into the abandoned rest area
it stops facing a battered phone booth the engine turns off but the headlines stay shining on the phone booth
nick turns off the radio
it is suddenly very quiet only the occasional lonely drone of a truck passing on the highway
he takes a deep breath
nick is standing in the phone booth harshly lit by his headlights
into the phone could you give me the number for information in arizona
nick dials with drunken concentration
into the phone enfield
carol carol umm
he hangs up
he hits himself in the head in angry disbelief
he hurriedly dials zero and listens for a moment desperately summoning up all his salesman charm
into the phone hello janet thank you for being my operator
i hope you can help me i need to call my home
nick listens impatiently
well ill tell you my number but theres a problem
my phones been disconnected not because of bills i mean we paid all our bills
we were hardly ever even late
we were very good customers but were moving so we had the phone disconnected
but now i need to call
the woman i live with
shes still there and ive got to let her know where i am
nick listens shaking his head emphatically
i dont know any of the neighbors
i know one but i cant remember her last name
he listens frustrated no
you see you have to be able to help me this is not a prank its my home phone this is an emergency
he listens then urgently yes it can it can be done
someone there can hook the phone back up
its not like a phone guy came to our house to disconnect the phone nobody came to our house someone just flipped a switch somewhere somewhere there where you work
or plugged something into a computer and our phone stopped working
he listens they turned it off they can turn it back on
he listens starting to panic i know its the week end
call them at home
theyll have a computer at their house theyll have a phone thing to hook it up to the real computer
thats how these people live
theyll be glad to do it
suddenly all his energy drains away
i cant have the police go to the house
that wont work there are circumstances
desperately its you
youve got to help me
ive gotta call home
i cant wait
it could be too late
youve gotta help me
you can reconnect me
dont hang up
dont hang up
he hurls the receiver at the phone
nick doubles over retching clutching the side of the booth
if youd like to make a call please hang up and try again
if you need help
sid is sprawled out over the bed sleeping beth nestled against him
she stirs and cuddles closer
suddenly she realizes its not nick
she pulls away orientating herself
she quickly scoots out of bed and hurriedly pulls on a pair of jeans
the alarm clock clangs
beth looks about for the alarm
she tensely scatters some boxes
she dumps one finds the alarm and shuts it off
she stares at the clock and drops it into a box
beth cringes slightly and turns to face sid
attempting a smile hi
i didnt want to wake you
cheerfully im awake
im a morning person
then why dont you come back to bed
ive got to pack
sitting up where do we start
softening you paint
she looks around the room littered with boxes and piles of clothes
cheerfully whatever you say
sid gets out of bed wrapping the sheet around himself
beth stares at the room
she suddenly trembles
she steadies herself on the bed table
beth avoids his eyes glancing around the room
an outpouring id be so much happier if i could blame this on nick but it always happens to me
im always left with nothing
taking a deep breath it doesnt matter if i leave the guy or if the guy leaves me im left with nothing
i never do anything for myself
i never acquire anything
i mean nick didnt take from me
he stole a t
and left it for me
he didnt take my things he didnt take our things
he didnt even take his clothes
and ill still leave this house with nothing
he took three years from you
meeting his eyes he didnt take em
i mean when he cared about me he cared about me
and he was really good in bed
she glances away from sid toward the bed
after a beat i didnt expect more
she turns away from sid and the bed
sid moves toward her
beth summons up all the composure she can manage
referring to the cluttered room i cant face this
looking to sid im gonna finish up the kitchen
heading for the door get some momentum
she goes out the bedroom door
sid stares after her
nicks sedan is parked in the same place as the night before
a young man with long hair roars into the rest stop on a harley davidson his lifes possession strapped on the back
he stops the bike between nicks car and the phonebooth idling the engine loudly
he looks to the phonebooth the receiver dangling
he turns to nicks sedan
awakened by the roar nick has wearily leaned his head out the window
nick stares at the young man
after a beat no
drained nick rests his head on the steering wheel
offscreen the motorcycle starts up and zooms away
a silence falls over the rest stop
without raising his head from the steering wheel nick starts the car
sid is making the bed
gleefully conspiratorially how was he
sheepishly hes twenty four
sid pulls up the blanket and fluffs the pillows
a little weak on tenderness but long on juice
long on conversation
the cupboards are all open and bare
a half dozen boxes are neatly stacked
beth is sitting on the floor packing the final dishes
carol holds out a mug of coffee
did you need talk
beth stands and takes the coffee
i guess i did
beth sips her coffee gazing out the kitchen window
in the light of day its lost its magical quality
the grass needs cutting and is marred by brown patches
the swingset looks pathetically rusted and dilapidated
her face clouds over
cheerfully so what are we doing
carol is staring at beth staring out at the backyard
she turns to carol
w an edge of desperation i gotta get out here
i was in tucson two years before you and nick got here
in disbelief ive been here five years
this states driving me crazy
so what are you gonna do
ive got no money
ive got some
chagrined by self awareness i cant take it
i mean youre being great but i cant take it
im gonna be gone we wont see each other and i wont send the money
i wont get around ill forget i wont do it
she looks around the room in disgust
ill sell all this shit
i dont want any of it just my car and my clothes
shaking her head im sorry
i shouldnt have fucked this kid last night
i should have slept
now ive got all this stuff to do and im tired im churned up im in a fuckin mood
lets do things get you busy
you get all the stuff you wanna sell and ill make some tag sale signs
no onell buy my stuff
its all junk
thats what people buy at tag sales
broken appliances ugly knicknacks
beth looks at the semi packed boxes
laughing i guess i do have stuff to sell
boxes full of a motley collection of knickknacks housewares and crummy appliances are spread out on the lawn
in the background a couple of m
influenced teens are checking out the knickknacks and goofing on them
dotson a woman in her late forties wearing a nurses uniform is poking through the odds and ends
beth and carol hovering near her
dotson picks up the coffee maker examines it and puts it down
she picks up the blender examines it and puts it down
impatiently is there something specific youre looking for
sheepishly actually everything
i dont have anything
i just moved to town
hesitating then confiding my husband passed away and i umm didnt want to have our things
they were too familiar
beth realizes why shes selling all her stuff its too familiar
abruptly you can have it all for three hundred
the stuff in these boxes and everything inside
taken aback oh my i dont know
hesitating except the t
dotson searches beths face with a kind gaze
beth smiles nervously
apologetically the t
s not for sale
nicks smoking looking haggard
between drags he anxiously taps a tempo on the steering wheel with his cigarette holding hand
the highway and the desert stretch out before him the heat waves of late afternoon shimmering above the blacktop
in the distance the giant teepee souvenir shop rises out of the horizon like a mirage
an idea strikes him and his lips tighten into a small determined smile
a couple of vacationing families and a busload of elderly sightseers poke through the stunning assortment of native american souvenirs
nick stands at the counter talking to a plump elderly navajo maybe some nice turquoise jewelry
shaking his head i dont think she really wears jewelry
a little boy stares at the disheveled nick
his mother hurries him away
maybe a nice navajo rug
incredulous as a present
he points past her
what about that
a huge beautifully feathered ceremonial headdress
that would make her laugh
not amused thats authentic its very expensive
you got something like it but fake
beth and mrs
dotson are standing beside the now empty blankets
in the background sid and carol are packing boxes into mrs
dotson has begun to fill out a check
im sorry whats your name
can you just leave the name blank
i wont have an account so ill have to find someplace to cash it for me
dotson looks at her
they stare into each others eyes
after a beat all right
dotson hands beth the check
beth sticks it in her back pocket
after an awkward moment she extends her hand
thanks a lot
dotson takes her hand
sid and carol walk up to them
cheerfully youre set
dotson lets go of beths hand
they turn to sid and carol
warmly chagrined you did all the work
good naturedly sure
mischieviously now ive gotta finish painting but carol here would be happy to help you unload
carol starts to protest and then checks herself for beths sake
trapped dryly of course
ill follow you in my car
dotson and ill be by tomorrow with my truck and the big things
he heads into the house
beth stares after him
dotson touches her shoulder lightly getting her attention
to beth thank you
smiling youve given me a home
she looks to carol
nicely ill be right along
dotson walks off toward her car
to beth this had to be historys most efficient tag sale
beth laughs distractedly
im sorry sid stuck you with unloading
smiling to herself he kinda bites my butt but hes okay
beth suddenly embraces carol
breaking the embrace ill probably be gone before you get back
i thought maybe we could be roomies for a while
you know while you figure out whats next
shaking her head i cant
after a beat admitting her feelings he gets to me
if i dont go ill end up with staying with him
gently youve done worse
they look at each other and start to laugh
their laughter builds a release of the strain of the last two days
nicks driving fast completely focused on the road ahead the wind roaring through the open windows
a cheap plastic indian headdress with brightly colored synthetic feathers is perched on his head
sids finished painting the room gleams
he pulls a dropcloth off the bureau then another one off of beths two packed suitcases
sid turns and looks smiling
beth is standing in the doorway a weariness having settled over her
she steps into the room
im sorry about selling the sofa bed
i didnt really need one
when my friends get drunk they throw up and sleep on the floor
but i gave it to you
he puts his arms around her
you gave me a lot more
holding him tightly it was all even in this department
softly feel me
whispering i know
youre hard again
holding her tightly sid runs his fingers down her spine
i want you all the time
she kisses him
they kiss long and hard
abruptly she breaks the embrace and moves away from him
ironically self aware i just fleeced a widow
it was all junk
ive got to get some aspirin
shaking her head i didnt drink enough to be hung over
she walks away from sid out of the bedroom
beth gulps down aspirin
she stares at herself in the mirror wearily searching
sid appears in the doorway his reflection small next to the reflection of her face
you just feel bad for her like i feel bad for her
cause her husband died
doubting this yeah
thats about the saddest thing there is
losing someone you love
beth is struck by a certainty that shes never lost anyone shes loved because shes never really loved anyone
its never happened to me
sid hesitates then speaks his heart
if you died i couldnt stand life
she steps forward and kisses him
she steps back
businesslike ive got to go now
she walks out of the bathroom
sid and the camera follow as she hurries though the living room toward the bedroom
the new peoplell be here
she disappears down the hall to the bedroom
following go to my house
beth picks up her suitcases
sid steps into the doorway
while you find a place
i gotta get out
she heads to the bedroom door
i can talk to the realtors i know theyve got a place in agawam
shaking her head no
i dont know where im going
she walks past him into the hallway
sid and the camera you can call me when you get there
ill give you my number
she stops and puts down the suitcases
im going away
youre making me way too important
you met me yesterday
he goes to her
and today i love you
she steps back shaking her head
that doesnt matter
you know that
it can take a second
beth loses control upset with herself for having mixed emotions upset with her life and upset hes making this more difficult
thats a fuckin animal thing ive done that
not with me
i meet men go home with them and just stay
no decision involved its just what i do
and then i dont have to live my life i just lead theirs
i cant keep doing that
adamant were not that way
what way are we
its been passionate its been comfortable
but it hasnt been
after a beat like youre making it
urgently it is important
you know that
it was a night
it wasnt real
it was fun it was some great fucking
but its just something that happened
its not real
it didnt just happen
you know were it
im the one for you
ive had lots of ones
i look like a baby but im twenty fuckin eight years old
youre just the latest
im the last
youve found me
and it can go on forever
her heart breaking for him oh sid
shaking her head you have to understand its just talk
defiantly disbelieving it is
cmon these things you say
if i died you couldnt stand life
beth cant bear the risk of opening her soul to believe him and she cant bear to hear the outpouring of his soul without believing him
so she ends it
after a beat harshly you wont know when i die
you wont be there
she picks up her suitcases and heads for the door
following her certain youd want me there
if i wasnt there it wouldnt matter who was
youd be alone
he grabs her arms and spins her to face him
you love me
how do you feel
you love me
she stares at him breathing deeply gathering herself
he lets go of her arms and steps back
her words carefully chosen i care about you
you have to be with me
pause i care about you
but im an adult
i can say no
they stare at each other
w controlled anger thats what makes you an adult
pause i can say no
pause no i wont do that
no i wont have that
no i cant
needing to hear her say it you can say no to me
he looks away from her
she stares at his back
she steps toward the door
after a beat have someplace to go
simply i dont
she opens the door
interrupting dont tell me what to do
she goes out the door
sid goes to the door
beth makes her way to her car
sid stands in the doorway watching
what are you gonna do
she turns and faces him
i dont know
beth tosses her suitcases in the backseat
she gets into the car and starts the engine
sid stands willing her to stop the car
beth pulls out to the end of the driveway
she looks up at the rearview mirror
sid is framed in the doorway of her old home waiting trusting that she cant leave that they are destined
her eyes well with tears
her face sets with resolve
the car pulls out and disappears down the road
sid stands in the doorway for a long moment
he steps back into the house and shuts the door
nick is driving the cheap headdress still perched on his head
crumpled empty coffee cups are scattered about the front seat
he reaches up and turns the rearview mirror
nicks face stares back at him
its not a pretty sight
nick reaches into the back seat fishes and comes up with his necktie
he slips the still knotted necktie over his headdress and tightens it around his neck
nick looks back to the road and suddenly swerves off an exit ramp
the camera lingers on the exit sign enfield az
sid silently goes through the motions of pulling the masking tape from around the window sills of the freshly painted room his face a stony mask
nicks car screeches to a stop in front of the house
he leaps out of the car and runs toward the front door
the front door flings open
nick charges into the room
calling out beth
sid steps through the swinging door into the living room
coldly shes not here
desperately where is she
a moment of manners excuse me
confrontationally who are you
coldly the painter
the indian chief
then nick remembering the headdress rips it off his head and furiously tears it apart scattering a flurry of plastic feathers
he hurls whats left of it across the room
accusingly youre too late
angrily i got that
whered she go
she didnt say
bitterly she didnt know
nick runs out the front door
nick runs out into his lawn
running under his breath be at carols
be at carols
the camera following he races up to carols front door and leans on the doorbell a loud tight buzzing
he pounds on the door then stops gasping for breath
no ones home
he turns leaning against the door for support staring out at tract house neighborhood
spent im too late
suddenly he bolts for his car
nick yanks his car door open and disappears into it
in a second he emerges with the bottle of scotch
he eyes it for a moment then hurls it as far as he can down the street it shatters explosively
he races to his front door and stops dead in his tracks at the open doorway
sid has covered the floor and remaining furniture with drop cloths and is applying even strokes to the ceiling with a long handled roller
nick steps in and stares at sid and his own nearly empty drop cloth covered home
at the top of his lungs this really bothers me
sid stares at him
after a moment with mock politeness will you do me a favor
spitting out the word what
nick advances on sid
i dont want to be normal
i dont have to be i dont
this is my house
youre in my house
and im tired of going to my house and finding strangers
theyre face to face in a stand off
its not your house
im painting he puts the long handled roller right in nicks face
for the new people whose house its going to be
pause youre gone
theyre not here yet
calmly i guess that makes this my house
nick ponders this logic sids size and the roller in his face
politely may i look around
w a stony politeness sure
make yourself at home
nick wanders around the nearly empty room then after a beat
he pulls a dropcloth off an object in the corner revealing the television
she left the television
pointedly she didnt seem to want it
is a remarkable thing
they both stare at the television
the sweep of headlights turning into the driveway cross their faces
they both race to the door
carol gets out of her car
nick hurries toward her
flatly you came back
a little chagrined yeah
is beth here
do you know where she went
youre too late
from the doorway shes gone
to carol exasperated who is this guy
walking past him toward the house beths new boyfriend
stopping you heard me
to sid is this true
he turns and walks back into the house
to carol not really
he races after sid
sid is painting the ceiling
nick bursts through the door
to sid not really
w say it aint so attitude did you fuck her
i dont tell
the next day
bitterly disillusioned thats the world huh
they dont even wait a day anymore
stepping in the doorway you left her
defensively i didnt fuck anyone
witheringly you didnt find anyone
i didnt leave her for another person i left her for another place
pause which i think is a little more excusable
well its none of your fuckin business
threateningly i think it is
cause you fucked her
that gives you no business in my life
if you hadnt gone id be done by now
id be home
be glad you have a home asshole
let it drop nick
he was nice to beth when you treated her like shit
nick stares at her knowing what she says is true
protesting weakly i came back
busting him nick
this is me
you didnt come back for beths sake something just didnt work out like you had planned
defensively you see you dont know everything about me i didnt really have any real plans
he was sweet to her
they were sweet with each other
nick stares at her
beth looked young with him
they had a real connection
after a beat dryly and i brought them together
he exhales loudly and holds his head in his hands
it seems im blessed
in what i do
i do wrong and it turns out right
that ive done right
so it really doesnt matter what i do
nick takes a deep breath
sid ignores him
after a beat i said hey
sid looks at him
flamboyantly sarcastic i hope youre very happy together
glancing to carol pointedly she is isnt she
to sid if you two were such the happy couple why the fuck did she leave romeo
after three years with you she wanted to be alone
i was already gone
this is not about me and beth there is no me and beth
this is about you
why didnt you go with her
it wasnt offered
advancing on him people arent going to offer you anything
you have to take what you want
you cant take another person
they have to give themselves to you
in his face thats very wise but not very true
relentlessly i sell televisions
people dont know what they want
you have to show them
i couldnt show her
go after her
leave him alone
hes not alone hes with us
shes out there alone
after a beat quietly just hoping shes closer to what she wants
sardonically and what is that
exploding i dont know
nick throws his arms in the air and storms up to carols face
how would i know
what do i know
carol doesnt flinch
he steps back
w a sweeping gesture i know that what i want isnt there
pointing to his chest it isnt here
gesturing wildly it isnt inside
it isnt outside
spent it doesnt exist
he turns on sid
forcefully but you want her and you arent doing shit about it
there isnt anything he can do
he can go after her
to sid go after her
torn my life is here
what kind of man wont fuck up his life for the women he loves
go find her
he stares at sid
he wouldnt know where to look
groping shed shed shed
triumphant shed head for her parents
shed head for her parents
pause then flatly theyre in florida
nick stares at sid waiting
businesslike you start driving east on route forty
keep going east and around eleven start checking every roadside motel
the budget ones
you do that all night youll find her
how do you know shes on the highway
when you dont know where youre going you drive on the highway
sid looks to carol then around the drop cloth covered room
cheerfully ill finish painting
to carol do i have a chance
nick and sid both look to carol
after a beat shaking her head youve got a chance
determined then im gone
sid races out the door
nick tosses a self satisfied smile at carol and walks past her to the door
sids truck engine roars to life
sid peels out driving up onto the lawn past nick and carols cars out onto the street and out of sight
carol steps into the doorway beside nick
dryly start painting
nick looks back into the room
after a beat fuck the ceiling
walking in who looks up that often
carol follows him into the room
nick slumps on the sofa staring at the blank t
happily this is it
a man and a woman both slightly portly mexican americans in their late forties wearing their sunday best step over the threshold and kiss
the man is carrying the woman cradled in his arms
surprised breaking the kiss oh
the four stare at each other in awkward silence the woman still cradled in the mans arms
we thought it was going to be empty
flatly it is
cheerfully were here to move in
the man puts her down on her feet
are you the couple moving out
nick and carol look to each other at a loss
nick looks back to the couple
improvising were your new neighbors
from next door
carol throws him a look
putting on a good face its nice to meet you
he holds out his hand to shake
after an instant of awkward hesitation they all shake hands with too much enthusiasm
cheerfully while shaking hands it is
and its so nice of you to greet us
they finish the handshakes theres an awkward pause
actually were here for the t
he waits half expecting this statement to be challenged
confidently the people who left here our old neighbors left us that t
they all look at the t
its very nice
theres an awkward pause
going to the t
we should carry it home
nick and carol lift the t
do you need help
we can manage
they move toward the front door carol going backwards
nick looks to make eye contact with carol
shes looking back over her shoulder for obstacles
he smiles and glances toward the couple
nick and carol go out the door lugging the t
calling out nice meeting you
the man and woman look at each other
they look around the room
theyre not done painting
she stares out the front door
whimsically i wonder where our furniture is
she looks back to him
hes staring at the ceiling
theyre lugging the t
across to carols carol backing up and nick going forward
they arrive at the front door
nick takes most of the weight of the t
while carol fumbles with her key into her front door lock with her free hand
youre not going to be their new neighbor
it was just something to say
carol gets the door open
carol backs into the house leading the way
they lug the t
toward the living room
you look terrible
well i had a big day
after a beat i went to my parents house
like you said to
and there was this ancient man this giant man in the doorway
they step into the living room
carol leads them to a corner
and i thought its my father
my how hes aged
you were drunk
they gingerly put the t
not at the house
at the house i was stone sober
nick slumps down onto the sofa
carol watches him puzzled
he was very tall
he was too tall to be my father
he was wearing a long overcoat and i thought its a trick hes on my mothers shoulders
he smiles at the memory
and then out from behind him came this beautiful young girl
lost in reverie and they sang to me
they sang london bridge is falling down
singing softly falling down falling down
nick looks to carol
she stares at him
seriously it was very touching
defensively it was
carol sits beside him
what youve been doing
you cant do anymore
nick looks to carol puzzled
you just cant do it
after a beat agreeably okay
very skeptically okay
i dont think so
defensively i understand
determined its not like you cant do it
interjecting ill stop
urgently its that i dont want you to do it
she stares at nick
he avoids her stare
she takes his face in her hand and makes him look at her
staring in his eyes nick
emphatic i dont want you to do it
nick stares in her eyes
calmly after a beat okay
she lets go of his face
after a beat wryly i hate talking to you
through the windshield we see sid driving slowly looking out at motel parking lots
their neon signs reflect in the windshield
gas stations fast food joints and motels
sid and his truck pull away from the strip and up onto the on ramp
sid and his truck pull onto the highway
as sids taillights disappear down the barren highway
