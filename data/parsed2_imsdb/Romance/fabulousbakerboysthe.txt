b if window
href b b the fabulous baker boys april draft an original screenplay by steve kloves warner boulevard burbank california april all rights reserved is standing before a dirty window looking
out at a dirty city street
he is wearing a tuxedo
its the girl from this afternoon
jack looks at the girl sleepy and warm under the bedcovers then at the rest of the apartment
whatcha doin over there
the girl glances at the bedside clock
will i see you again
jack looks out at the dirty street again
the girl doesnt appear terribly unnerved by this
at the tux you werent wearing that were you
jack shakes his head taps a brown paper bag on the sill
shit thank god
you look like a creep
i mean id hate to think id pick up someone who wore that shit
jack smiles grabs the paper bag and moves to the door
as he stops you got great hands
jack aint exactly cary grant but any guy wearing a tux on these streets doesnt exactly mesh with the milieu
pausing for a flask of whiskey at an all night liquor store he breaks the seal before he hits the sidewalk and moves on drinking as he goes
finally he comes to a nice downtown hotel
slipping the bottle in his coat he squints up at the glittering building as if sizing up an opponent
how goes it tommy
shrugging ah you know
losing his teeth
its the goddamn water
kill an ox
i buy bottled for my danny
you cant trust the taps
standing back jesus you look like fucking royalty tommy
tommy brushes at his new velvet coat
the big boys sent it down yesterday
another five years huh
you got a good memory jackie
it aint always a blessing
my brother here
nodding hes got blood in his eye
jack glances at his watch waves to tommy and moves into the hotel
jacks older brother frank is pacing outside the lounge when he sees jack approaching
glad you could make it
how we doing
what are you kidding me
am i late
thats not the point
taking out a cigarette whats the point
you cannot continue to walk in at the last moment jack
you want me to show up late a few nights
i always get here
dont sweat it
christ will you look at your hair
jack turns to the wall which is paneled in tiny tinted mirrors shot through with veins of gold
whats wrong with it
you look like you just crawled out of bed
no ones gonna be looking at my hair
come on were on
frank just stands there bottled up with exasperation
continuing careful frank
when you get angry your tie starts to spin
jack steps into the lounge and frank shaking his head follows
as they move away a cardboard stand up is revealed
on it are two x glossies of frank and jack and below printed in bold letters this tonight
the doubly delightful tones of the fabulous baker boys
as they make their way through the dimly lit lounge and settle behind matching pianos it becomes apparent that what the fabulous baker boys are in fact is a poor
mans version of ferrante and teicher
as they begin to plink out their theme song tables of middle aged couples sipping enormous banana daiquiries begin to tap their feet and bob their heads
after a few bars the boys finish with a flourish and the couples applaud
smile thank you
good evening and welcome to the starfire lounge
my name is frank baker and eighty eight keys across from me is my little brother jack
little brother jack smiles winks and takes a draw on his cigarette
continuing could do this in his sleep you know my brother and i have been playing together gosh i dont know
how long has it been jack
twenty eight years frank
thats a lot of water under the bridge eh jack
of course back then things were a little different
i was eight jack was seven just about the only song we knew was my bonnie lies over the ocean and the only one who would listen to us was
the family cat cecil
to jack we must have shaved three lives off that cat eh jack
jack smiles like hes got a mouth full of razor blades
continuing but seriously
its been fifteen years since jack and i first stepped on the stage as professionals
three states sixty eight cities and more grayhairs then wed like to admit later
well believe me weve seen our share of this crazy country of ours
but even though weve played some of the finest venues in the world
at this point jack begins to mimic his brothers words
continuing theres one place thats always been for us a very special place and that place is
this place the starfire lounge
jack lays in a few soft bass chords
well i guess you could just say its the
pregnant moment people
at which point franks hands descend onto the keyboard and give birth to the melody of what else
they exit the stage to applause
remember room service is available till one a
for you late nighters
jack and frank pass through the steamy hotel kitchen
dont make trouble all right
whos gonna make trouble
spotting someone hey amigo
in an apron cutting meat off a huge soup bone looks up
the feelings mutual yeah hi hector
re the soup bone for eddie
as they exit i mean it jack
like an angel
frank stands across the desk from a young man who despite his youth has an irritatingly paternal attitude toward the two men in his office
jack stays in the doorway smoking a cigarette as if to venture any further is to risk contracting some hideous disease
preparing a cash envelope terrific boys
youre just what we needed on a night like this
frank glances at jack and realizes he should have left him in the kitchen with hector and the soup bone
only jack do me a favor will ya pal
if you wanna smoke put on a pair of sunglasses and go play with the niggers on state street
these blisters from the midwest dont wanna watch some guy dripping ash all over himself while hes playing the sound of music
smoke curls out of jacks nose
he is utterly still like a pit bull eyeing a steak
okay boys that ought to buy you a few more lessons
by the way frankie im declaring this
lloyd slaps a slender envelope onto the desk and business closed busies himself with other matters
you dont know when youll be wanting us back do you lloyd
ill call you
uh well you know the way our schedule is i thought maybe
ill call you
frank bites down and takes the envelope from the desk
count the fucking money frank
lloyd looks up
jack is staring right into him
reluctantly frank opens the envelope
its all here
pulling jack out ill be talking to you lloyd
lloyd doesnt answer
he just looks at jack smiling with amusement
jack comes out onto the street holding the wrapped soup bone dogged by frank whos got the cardboard stand up under his arm
you mind telling me what that was about in there
was that planned
or were you just bored and decided to get creative
this isnt the pine tree inn on route jack
to himself fuck him
the fabulous bakers walk in silence until they come to franks car
frank opens the trunk and starts to put the stand up away
so we on tomorrow night
shaking his head maybe thursday
i hear the harpist at the sheratons got appendicitis
jack nods and starts to walk away
why dont you come out to the house this weekend
say hello to the kids
i hate your kids frank
youre their uncle
only by relation
besides they hate me too
theyre always asking about you
they tried to electrocute me frank
it was an accident
it was no fucking accident frank
the little one
she threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub
how do you explain that
she didnt know what she was doing
youre too sensitive
you got weird kids frank
look i just thought if you came out you might see what youre missing
jack just stares at frank
continuing just think about it all right
consider it a standing offer
frank closes the trunk and moves to the drivers side
continuing like a litany you want a ride jack
no frank ill walk
okay jack good night
good night frank
frank turns the engine over and pulls away from the curb
jack watches the taillights burn into the distance then takes the whiskey bottle from his coat and heads for home
jack crosses the street and waves up to his apartment building where a black labrador is studying him from a second story window
jacks apartment is small old and comfortably cluttered
the most striking item is a vintage phone booth placed against the wall
as jack lets himself in eddie the dog from the window walks over
he is not an overly enthusiastic dog but you can see from his face that he has a great deal of affection for jack
thought you were gonna clean the apartment
eddie nuzzles the soup bone
jack unwraps the paper and hands it over
continuing take it easy will ya
youre becoming a regular johhny appleseed the way youre dropping teeth around here
jack hangs his tie on the phone booth and walks over to an old phonograph stacked six deep with discs
he lifts the records back up the post and clicks on the machine
as bill evans smoky peace piece fills the tiny apartment jack breaks the collar of his shirt and walks over to the old piano near the window
settling back with the bottle of whiskey jack rests his elbows gently on the keys and stares out the open window listening to the music
jack and frank work opposite sides of a large piano showroom inspecting rentals of every style and color
willie the owner of the place leans against a cheap upright contemplating his shoes
what happened to the two clays willie
when they coming in
frank looks across the room at jack
what dya got
taps a key flat
what dyou say willie
tighten her up
whats the gig
willie just looks at his shoes and shakes his head
frank frowns and glances around
across the room jack pauses before another piano
continuing what dya got
tapping yamaha white
frank moves to another grand and alternates taps with his brother to see if the two pianos are in harmony
what do you think
try the black knable
frank moves to another piano and repeats the process watching jack for a verdict
after a moment jack nods
tag em willie
the regency downtown thursday friday
the brothers sit at a window of a corner diner jack nursing an ice coffee frank playing with a plate of scrambled eggs
the glass next to them is cluttered with photographs of neighborhood luminaries including two of jack and frank in their tuxedoes
you know i think its been five years since i saw you eat anything
thats the gods truth
trust me youre not missing anything
you look awful
only on odd days
a look seeing anyone in particular
why the interest
because im your brother
because i care about you
because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that goddamn dog of yours
jack studies his brothers face
im not seeing anyone
what about that waitress at the ambassador
how about you
you seeing anyone
points at his wedding band strike a bell
its only a ring
not a collar
its more than that
jack smiles and sips his coffee
continuing by the way we gotta go see ma tomorrow
no i mean it
so do i
we gotta go jack
no you gotta go cause if you dont get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty
i wont feel guilty so i dont gotta go
this time you gotta go
i dont gotta go
you gotta go
your older brother
youre thirteen months older than me frank
that mightve meant something in the apache clubhouse but it dont cut too deep anymore
christ jack its her birthday
jack glances up
continuing so what do you say
think the city can spare you for an afternoon
jack squints out the window
and dont worry about a present
i got her something from both of us
jack cradling a pink bakery box in one hand gets out of franks car and surveys the street on which he grew up
make sure you lock
unless you count the elderly gentleman picking roses three houses down there would not appear to be a wealth of potential car thieves in the immediate vicinity
but its not jacks car so he doesnt press the point
place looks good huh
i got a neighbor boy to mow the lawn pick up
timesve changed huh
pointing see the tree
remember the job cecil did on it the day dad planted it
you can still see the scars on the trunk
i was looking at it just the other day
jesus i thought he was gonna kill that cat
frank smiles recalling cecils near demise then raps on the front door
jack studies the tree a moment then gestures to the tiny ribboned box in franks hand
so whatd we get her
at that moment the door swings open and ellie baker is there a vibrant woman in her sixties
well if it isnt the fabulous baker boys
hows the birthday girl
a little stiffer but just as sturdy
baker hugs frank then a bit awkwardly embraces jack
its good to see you
uncomfortable balancing cake box good to see you ma
jack looks over his mothers shoulder at frank and mimics john with a knowing nod
uh ma you know no one calls him that anymore
he goes by jack
i thought maybe held gotten over that
twenty years ma
its just that john is so much nicer
jack sounds so
when i was a little girl we had a pig on the farm named jack
i guess i just cant help making the association
jacks eyes slide over to frank as if to suggest he holds his brother personally responsible for this
yeah well you know ma john kennedy went by jack
what do you expect
oh well whats in a name right
lets go inside and have a look at that cake
baker exits frank leans over to jack
keep her busy will ya
i have to set a few things up
frank disappears leaving jack alone on the porch with the bakery box
jack shakes his head wondering how hes going to make it through the afternoon then enters the house
the front room is cluttered with his childhood
most noticeable are the pianos two tiny uprights perfectly matched their simulated ivory keys yellowed with age
above them pressed between glass and framed are the music ribbons faded by twenty years of sunlight
finally there is the sheet music dusty and dog eared piled everywhere in drunken stacks
this and all else in the room jack confronts slowly warily but with a noticeable dispassion until his eyes fall upon a photograph
in it he and frank are standing alonside a tall man in baggy slacks safe within the arc of his long arms
frank is staring straight into the camera neat clean perfectly posed but jack a year younger his shirt too big is caught in profile looking up at the tall man
with an almost worshipful gaze
entering well now wheres everyone run off to
all at once jack and his mother realize they are alone
well shall we cut that cake
jack nods and follows her into the kitchen
he places the box on the table and stands off to the side while mrs
baker sets about preparing things
how are you
jack watches his mother poise the knife over the cake
her fingers are trembling
continuing big piece or little
im not much for sweets
hows that dog of yours
what was his name
how is he
hes losing his teeth
baker stops and looks up into jacks eyes
suddenly a noise is heard in the other room
sounds like your brothers back with us
frank comes stumbling up the basement stairs with an old movie projector and a roll up screen
entering whats all this
frank sets the projector down and hands his mother the tiny ribboned box
jack watches from the kitchen doorway as mrs
baker pulls the ribbon off the box
inside is a tiny spool of film
why whats this
blank screen curtains drawn the room dark
frank clicks on the projector and picks up his cake
baker close on his elbow sets her plate on her knees and watches the screen
jack sits off to the side
a title card appears for mrs
ellie baker who made it all possible
baker gives frank a puzzled look
he just smiles
suddenly images spring to the screen obviously footage several years old showing jack and frank as children sitting at the tiny pianos wearing matching suits smiling matching smiles as they
play for the camera
oh my god
recognize these two characters
i thought these were lost
where did you find
in the attic
behind some of dads stuff
pointing with his fork look jack can hardly reach the pedals
as franks laughter fills the dark room jack stares with cold fascination at the screen
suddenly a jagged cut springs the boys a year later in the same positions smiling the same smiles
laughing oh no
i had a boy down at the camera shop cut them all together
boy old man henderson didnt fool around when he gave a haircut did he jack
jack says nothing
oh look at you two
and those tiny suits
here comes dad
jacks eyes narrow as the film jumps another year and a man enters the frame obviously by accident
he is so tall his face cannot be seen
as he dances quickly out of sight he ruffles jacks hair
as the film jumps again jack glances at the photograph to his right
the images on the screen flicker softly off the glass of the picture frame
continuing oh look how youre growing
my little boys
jacks eyes drift from the photograph to his mother and brother sitting close together in the love seat laughing
after a moment their voices fade and jack looks back to the children on the screen like two tiny men mirror images of one another
at first the changes are subtle
little jacks tie is askew his shirt missing a button
but as the years flick by the brothers resemble one another less and less until finally the little boy that was jack is completely gone and in his place is
a slouching tousle haired adolescent in rumpled coat and open collar a cigarette hanging disdainfully from his lip
a womans hand darts into the frame and plucks the offending cigarette away in a flash
frank and jack are parked in front of jacks building
whispers of steam snake from the mancovers in the street
i made her nervous
what do you mean
jack holds out a trembling hand
jack looks over at frank
continuing couple years now
taps his heart keeps the beat steady
jack considers this a moment then gets out of the car
she was glad to see you
jack lets himself into his apartment and stops
across the room curled up on the couch is a little girl
jack takes the girl gently in his arms and carries her to the bedroom
as he folds a blanket under her chin he pauses
the girls face is calm peaceful
the next morning
the sun is peeking sleepily between the buildings and beginning to drip out onto the street
suddenly ringing out over the rooftops is jingle bells not the entire song just the first two bars over and over
jack on the couch his arm draped over a slumbering eddie opens his eyes
across the room seated at the piano is nina the little girl
she stops playing and turns
you want coffee
i made coffee
jack looks into the sleepy face of eddie and sits up
he nods to the coffee
nina goes to the kitchen
continuing i did the dishes last night
youre missing a cup
jack rubs his head then gets up and walks to the window
continuing did you break a cup jack
nina looks at eddie sleeping on the couch then brings jack his coffee with both hands
i practiced the piano last night
i think im ready for jingle all the way
suddenly the sound of heavy footsteps is heard
jack and nina glance up at the ceiling
continuing guess theyre up
whats he do
ma said its like a lawyer only the hours are more regular
all i knows he came to take the tv one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner
what happened to the donut king
upstairs a door slams and heavy feet echo in the stairwell
nina peers out the window
maybe they had a fight
two deep thumps sound on the ceiling
continuing well gotta go
teach me later
nina kisses him on the cheek and exits
jack walks over to the couch and gives eddie a nudge
though the plastic palms and grass skirted waitresses of the luau lounge make the fabulous baker boys presence seem a bit incongruous jack and frank hold nothing back giving mccarthur
park the full treatment
unfortunately the audience in the luau lounge wouldnt fill a hawaiian haystack and their applause is less than volcanic
uh thank you
that concludes our show for this evening
jack and i only hope you enjoyed yourselves as much as we did
as the guests wander out clutching their roomkeys a freckle faced bellhop comes up
tired yeah jimmy
simpson asked to see you
all right tell him ill be right there
as jimmy exits frank stands and points at jack
continuing tomorrow we close with the aquarius suite
frank pauses before a door marked hotel manager
its half open
inside charlie simpson a heavy man in a shiny suit is throwing darts in the general direction of a dartboard
hes not very good
you wanted to see me charlie
yeah come on in
little slow tonight
waving it off mondays
charlie takes an envelope from his desk and hands it to frank
why not tomorrow
after the show
take it now
confused what about tomorrow
we dont need you frankie
for a moment frank just stands there
ive got the grands for two nights charlie
you cant just its all there
frank looks at the envelope in his hands
whatre you saying charlie
you and jack been playing here a long time
right twelve years
couple times a month
so maybe its time we took a vacation from each other
christ charlie its a monday night
you said so yourself
it wasnt half full out there tonight frankie
i got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball
i gotta move the liquor
to move the liquor i gotta fill the tables
its a matter of economics
me i love you
i love both you guys you know that
but people today
they dont know class if it walks up and grabs em by the balls
jack rises as frank passes through the lobby with the cardboard stand up
whats with charlie
with the stand up under his arm frank enters and closes the door quietly
a light is glowing in the kitchen
the rest of the house is dark quiet
in the kitchen he checks the message pad by the phone
on the table a plate of cold chicken is waiting for him
next to it is a stack of bills with a note attached frank
frank sighs and leans the stand up against the wall
the photo of jack is peeling off the cardboard
finding a stack of glossies in a drawer frank removes the old jack from the stand up and replaces it with a new one
as he presses the photograph in place his eyes drift to the one of himself
it was taken a long time ago
jack places a record on the turntable and sits at the piano by the window
as the needle hits the spinning disc a sharp snappy bass line reverberates throughout the apartment
jack takes a drink then joins in with the record playing along
his concentration is intense so much so that a moment later when the phone rings he seems not to hear it
finally he picks it up
come out to the house tomorrow will ya
ive had enough family for one month frank
its not family
so talk to me tomorrow
after the gig
we dont get a gig
whatre you talking about
something came up
dont worry charlie stayed true
ill give you your share tomorrow
at the house
continuing so youll come out right
jack listens to the phone hissing in the dark then the connection goes dead
a taxi lets jack off on a street of shabby tract houses
in his rumpled city suit jack looks like a cheap gangster amid the weedy lawns and overgrown junipers
he walks up to the door of a small white house and presses the doorbell
when there is no response he goes around to the back
the backyard is small with a short chainlink fence surrounding it
two kids a girl and a boy are splashing around in a build it yourself above ground pool
when they see jack they stop splashing
only their heads are visible above the water
the two heads say nothing
continuing what dya say
wanna run and get him for me
jack frowns takes out a cigarette and pats his pocket for a match
the kids eyes widen at his profanity
jack the unlit cigarette dangling from his lip ponders things for a moment then flicks thecigarette away and steps over the fence
at which point the tinier of the two heads in the pool begins to scream
continuing hey kid
take it easy
the kids a world class screamer
frank wearing baggy shorts and looking alarmed comes racing out of the house
what is it
your doorbell doesnt work
honey its only uncle jack
you remember uncle jack
donna franks wife appears
whats the matter
lifting cindy out of the pool nothings the matter
is it sweetheart
ill take her inside
you too little frank
out of the pool
donna shepherds the kids toward the house
the kids wipe their dripping feet on the outside mat and disappear into the house
frank turns to jack
continuing its probably the excitement of seeing you again
donna comes out of the house with a tray of lemonade
the men are sitting by the pool in a pair of webbed aluminum chairs
well look at this
you bring trunks jack
you could use some sun
maybe next time
we have some lotion
just the same
donna returns to the house
frank takes a sip of his lemonade and scans his surroundings complacently
were gonna paint in the spring
after the rains
look good as new
you ask me out here to sell me your house frank
frank shakes the ice in his glass
continuing charlie paid you off last night didnt he
i dont know what you mean
the hell you dont
i told you
something came up
some political dinner or something
fifteen years frank
no one paid us off
it wasnt like that
what was it like
hey pal i got a mortgage all right
i got two kids
i got a wife
besides he made the deal
theres no shame in it
that how you see it
yeah thats how i see it
jack shakes his head in disgust
continuing and dont go shaking your head little brother
im not the one who walks in every night smelling like hes got a day job in a piss factory
pause it killed him you know
jack glances up
a gust of wind killed him
yeah and what put him up there
hey you werent there
jacks look ends this
look can we forget last night
we gotta talk
i been thinking maybe we should make some changes
pause i been thinking maybe we should take on a singer
sure why not
its just an idea
i want your opinion
i mean we go halfway on everything right
its more like wouldnt you say
we agreed that if i took care of the business id be entitled to the extra
isnt that what we agreed
thats what we agreed
if youre unhappy with the arrangement im not unhappy
if youd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities id be glad frank
ive tried to do well by you jack
by both of us
im grateful frank
for the singer
i thought maybe twenty percent
look with the additional bookings well come out ahead
the big hotels they want a pretty girl with a big voice
we have to stay competitive jack
jack laughs coldly
all these years you been telling me were different
we got novelty jack
no one can touch us
two pianos isnt enough anymore jack
it never was
in pink sweater and a short black skirt stands in the center of a tiny room in the back of willies piano showroom holding some sheet music
sammy davis jr
s face is on the sheet music
frank is sitting against the opposite wall a notepad in his hand
jack is at the piano
good morning miss
all right miss moran actually thats my stage name
the whole thing
its my stage name
my real names blanche
no romance right
thats why i came up with monica
its what i prefer
well thats fine but if you call my house and my mother answers ask for blanche
if you ask for monica shell think you have the wrong number and hang up
and if she asks what its about dont tell her
shes opposed to my career
well miss moran what is it youd like to do for us
worried is that all right
its one of jacks favorites
monica turns and seeing jack at the piano gives a little start
i almost forgot you were there
heres the music
monica begins to hand jack the sheet music
he knows it
isnt that a coincidence
she likes jack
well shall we
probably not but jack begins to play anyway laconically picking out the cheery tune while monica swings her arms and taps her foot
despite all this monica still manages to come in between beats and jack has to scramble over a chord to catch her sort of like a fireman with a net
who can take a sunrise sprinkle it with dew toss it in the air and make a groovy lemon pie the candy man can the candy man can
there would appear to be ample evidence as to why the mother of monica nee blanche opposes her daughters career
thank you miss moran thats enough
monicals eyes are closed now and she is fully caught up
frank looks over at jack
jack shrugs and continues to play
continuing miss moran
monicas eyes pop open
i get so caught up in it sometimes
yes it is
to jack bye
as monica exits jack and frank glance at one another and thus begins a seemingly endless parade of aspiring singers who cant sing
as frank sinks lower in his chair and jacks ashtray spills over with wounded cigarettes singer after singer in all shapes sizes and colors come forth to offer their own
unique interpretations of feelings i gotta be me this is my song and perhaps most appropriately what kind of fool am i
finally when it is all over jack and frank are left alone in the tiny room looking dazed exhausted and mildly homicidal
as the sequence ends a tall young woman in high heels walks into willies
she glances around then spots willie across the room eating a corn beef on rye
you one of the fabulous baker boys
are putting on their coats preparing to leave
frank is staring at his notepad
thirty seven girls
and not one who can carry a tune
that must be statistically impossible
it was a somewhat extraordinary day
i just dont understand
you would think someone
the woman in high heels stumbles into the doorway holding a shoe in her hand
continuing brand new thursday
you believe it
after today jack and frank are prepared to believe anything
continuing this where the auditions are
this is where the auditions were
what do you mean
what about me
frank looks at his watch
youre an hour and a half late
my watch is broken too
first rule of show business
the woman looks around her
this is show business
in no mood look miss
were tired you have gum on your lip and were going home
touching her lip just like that huh
youre not even gonna give me a chance
dont take it personally
how should i take it
frank begins to leave
i dont believe it
i come all the way down down here break a heel and youre not gonna give me a chance because i have gum on my lip and im a few
youre an hour and a half late
so if im so late how come youre still here
we ran long
so run a little longer
miss you find a girl
jack and frank glance at each other
im here youre here the pianos here
what dya say
before frank can answer jack walks over to the piano
whats that mean
dont worry about it
to frank you know im feeling a lot of hostility from you
lets get it over with
whats your name
you have any previous entertainment experience miss diamond
for the last four years ive been on call to triple a escort service
jack and frank exchange a glance
continuing hey its legit
strictly dinner and dance
i think thats all we need to know
i sing now
thats the premise
susie gives frank a dark look then turns to jack
i get along without you
jack nods and begins to play
frank slouches down in his chair preparing to be tortured again
continuing singing i get along without you very well of course i do except when soft rains fall and drip from leaves then i recall the thrill of being sheltered
in your arms of course i do but i get along without you very well
frank just sits there
jack just sits there
she can sing
well let you know
jack looks over at frank like hes insane
when we know
smiling dont leave a girl hanging
second rule of show business
franks not amused
continuing yeah well okay
susie walks out barefoot
what are you crazy
i just thought we should talk about it
whats there to talk about
she can sing
that puts her at the head of the class
that makes her the only one in the class
i dont know
she had gum on her lip for christ sake
i dont think shes right for the act
studying him youre getting cold feet about this
i was just thinking what ma would think
was ma there the last time we played the ambassador
oh thats right she was on bass
how could i forget
frank frowns and looks down at his hands
continuing how many other silent partners are there frank
hell lets give eddie a vote
ill call the girl
frank gets up wearily then glances down at the notepad
whats the matter
i didnt get her number
jack and frank dash out of willies and glance up and down the street
we can always look her up in the book
shes probably listed right next to monica moran
jack shakes his head in disgust
does this mean i get the job
jack and frank whirl around
there standing in the doorway is susie
gleaming beautifully at the start of a new day
once again jingle bells is heard only this time carried a little further jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
ensconsed in the back room of willies preparing for their first rehearsal
frank poises his hands over the piano hesitates then looks at jack again
jack squints at frank then nods
frank turns to susie
looking around what are we an orchestra all of a sudden
frank g ares at her
frank poises his hands over the piano again and begins to play the opening passage of just the way you are
a moment later jack joins in and a moment after that susie
unfortunately jack and frank accustomed to playing alone are a tad overwhelming and the result sounds like a fifth grade recital
after a few bars susie holds up her hand
jack and frank stop
whats the problem
the problem is i cant hear myself sing with all this
you know what im saying
jack and frank look at one another
continuing i mean back there it may be hard to notice but up here im having a little trouble getting a word in
jack and frank just stare
continuing i mean youre supposed to be backing me up right
we are not supposed to be backing you up
what i mean is were a team
we work together
so work with me not against me
frank stares at susie for a long moment
i suppose we can bring it down a little
ill drop the eighths
susie looks at the two brothers
frank is on willies telephone
in the front of the store just out of earshot jack sits at a beat up grand while susie moves aimlessly from one piano to another
im telling you ray
shes got a voice like an angel
frank glances furtively across the room to where susie making a very sexy silhouette against the front window is running her hand over a pearl white piano
continuing no i wouldnt say shes got a body like an angel
as frank continues to talk in the background susie looks over at jack
hey hes not sore is he
hell come around
susie nods goes back to stroking the piano
continuing you never sang before
not for money
with my mother
jack nods slowly but susie sees he doesnt understand
continuing she used to waitress downtown nights when i was a kid
on the way home wed sing
you know how people whistle when theyre nervous
my mother sang
she always said youre never alone with a song cause thousands of people know the same song and even though you cant hear em theyre singing with you
i dont know
if they were they were all singing safe inside their apartments
shrugging but it worked
we always got home
ever since i always wanted to sing
i never took lessons or anything though
i guess you guys took a lot of lessons
jack looks down at the piano in front of him
we took a lot of lessons
jacks tuxedo is hanging in the shower as he gets ready for the nights gig
nina standing next to him at the sink watches as he works up a lather on a bar of shaving soap then paints his face with the suds
you shave like an old movie jack
as jack picks up a razor nina takes the brush and begins to soap her face in the mirror
in the old days every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop
then whenever he wanted a shave held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug waiting for him
is that what you used to do
my days are not the old days genius
what are they
the recent past
nodding to the ceiling bigfoot gets his out of a can
how do you know
i saw his stuff in the bathroom
i guess its getting serious
maybe hell ask your ma to marry him
i hope not
hes already busted the springs in two chairs
hey whats this
nina holds up the handle of the shaving brush
older than me
jack gives nina a look then begins to splash his face
nina picks up the razor
hey what do you want to do
grow a beard
well lets get your first prom under the belt okay
whats a prom
ever go to church
its like that
only you gotta dance
as jack enters the hotel he passes by the cardboard stand up prominently displayed in the lobby
it is virtually unchanged except for a small notation at the bottom with guest vocalist
on the other side of the lobby frank is pacing nervously
where the hell is she
i told everyone seven fifteen
shell get here
just like the day of the auditions right
hows my hair
yeah well yours isnt
taking out a comb let me run a comb though it
get out of here
come on stand still
get out of here
its not gonna hurt you
ill hit you frank
frank hesitates like a basketball player trying to feint an opponent then takes a flick at jacks hair
jack hits him
holding his shoulder you hit me
i told you i was gonna hit you
he looks capable of hitting him again too
all right all right
im a little tense
youre a fucking alarm clock
i just wish shed get here thats all
susie wearing a flamboyant orange dress is standing across the lobby staring at the stand up
christ look at her
youd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes shed have enough sense to come in the back
walking over good evening miss diamond
wheres my name
and how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster
well talk about it later
right now you gotta get changed
wheres your dress
to jack whats he talking about
is there a language problem here
where is it
do i look like im naked
you cant wear that
whats wrong with it
to jack am i missing something
before jack can reply frank grabs susies hand and pulls her toward the door
we dont have much time
time for what
frank jack and susie dash through a cavernous downtown department store the brothers turning a few heads with their tuxedoes
as they reach the ladies department frank begins to flip through the dress racks
if you ask me this is pretty stupid
what do you wear
offended a seven
my wife wears a seven
you dont look like a seven to me
i wear a seven
here how about this
looking save it for your wife
were not exactly silly with time you know
jack you find anything
jack somewhat out of his element is looking at belts
here hows this
frank holds out an inky black dress
susie gives it a long look
continuing close enough
frank begins to drag susie into the dressing room
i dont know about you but where i come from theres a little girls room and a little boys room and the little boys dont go where the little girls
all right but make it quick
what size do you wear
from the dressing room nine
to himself big feet
frank and jack work the shoe department scouting the endless rows
holding one up how about these
jack for crying out loud
your bachelorhoods showing
seeing something ah here we go
frank grabs a pretty blue pump and gestures to the salesman whos waiting on a woman
do these come in black
ill be with you in a minute sir
i dont have a minute pal
yes or no
they come in black
give me a pair of nines
the salesman looks casually at jack
does he want a pair too
as jack and frank return to the dress department frank jettisons the shoebox and tissue paper
all right we got your shoes
just then susie steps out of the dressing room
even frank stops at the sight of her
what do you think
turning to jack zip me up
the dress is open down to the small of her back
its a nice back
jack takes the zipper and closes the panels carefully
frank puts the shoes down and susie steps into them
well theyre aspiring to be sevens
you can buy new ones tomorrow
well take it out of your share
youre a prince
as the trio rushes into the hotel service entrance ray the assistant manager appears
you better buy yourself a watch frankie
we had a little emergency
yeah well ive got a little emergency
you know what im saying
seeing susie whos this minnie pearl
all eyes turn to susies dress which still has the tags attached
moving off jesus
i want seventy five minutes frankie
you hear me
this is going well isnt it
the three rush into the kitchen
we need scissors over here
whos got scissors
turning to susie okay remember
jack and i go on first i do the set up then introduce you
and you say
deadpan good evening ladies and gentlemen
i cant tell you how thrilled i am to be here
its like a dream come true
and speaking of dreams
piece of cake
a tiny man in an apron walks up with a meat cleaver
carlos thats a cleaver
i need scissors
lets go jack
fix your tie
jack and frank exit
susie stares a little warily at carlos and his cleaver
jack and frank slide quickly behind their pianos
about half the tables in the room are filled
good evening ladies and gentlemen
welcome to the ambassador lounge
my names frank baker and no youre not seeing double its just my little brother jack
continuing im glad youre all in such a good mood tonight because weve got a very special evening planned
susie sits on a stool while carlos positions the dress tags on a cutting board
as a waitress from the bar passes by susie snares a drink from her tray
just a sip
to kill the butterflies okay
but no lipstick
susie takes a quick sip
no ones the wiser
as the waitress exits carlos brings the cleaver down with a sharp chop severing the tags
appreciate it ace
the audience is laughing
but seriously folks as i sit here tonight looking out on all your kind faces i cant help but feel some of us have met before
we may not know each others names we might not recognize one another on the street but we know each other just the same
and over the years weve shared something
a little music a little drink a little laughter maybe even
a few tears
but i guess thats what friends are for huh
jack puts out his cigarette
and its especially nice to be among friends tonight because well tonights a very special night for my brother and i
this evening weve asked a young lady to join us a lady jack and i are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all
shes making her debut here this evening and as far as im concerned she couldnt be doing it in a better place
because theres one place thats always been for us a very special place and that place is this place the ambassador lounge
ladies and gentlemen please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song miss susie diamond
susie strides out of the kitchen past the busing station and up to the microphone stand which unfortunately is not on
continuing whispering the switch
hit the switch
as she hits it what fucking switch
continuing very demure pardon me
jack and frank look at one another then before outrage can set in plunge into the opening number
susie takes the mike from the stand and smiles sweetly
continuing i cant tell you how thrilled i am to be here
for the moment the audience doesnt seem quite sure how thrilled they are to be here
continuing im all smiles darling through and through
a bellboy exits the elevator and hearing susies voice coming from the lounge stops
he looks to the clerk behind the front desk
i thought the bakers were on tonight
well whos that
the clerk looks up from the register and listens
i dont know
judging from the faces susies as big a hit in the lounge as she is in the lobby
head thrown back eyes closed she sings with abandon finishing on a long extended note then swooping down in a dramatic exhausted bow
there is a split second of silence then thunderous applause
the new trio fresh off their first gig come out of the service entrance into the night
she says fucking in front of an entire room of people
i said i was sorry
to jack did you hear it
look they were all on their third mai tais by the time i got out there anyway
directly to her fucking
for christ sake i said it i didnt do it
pulling out some bills besides i dont think they were too offended do you
grabbing the bills give me that
we are not a saloon act
we do not take tips from dirty old men
innocent i was gonna split it with you guys
we do not take tips
ill apply this to the cost of the dress
frank puts the money in his pocket
susie stares at him steaming
then i want my name on the poster
and my picture
taking off her shoes and these shoes are too goddamn tight
susie hurls the shoes at frank and stalks off barefoot
jack is leaning against the wall watching it all with amusement
on franks expression we hear the opening notes of new york new york and we see susie and the boys performing it in one lounge after another playing to increasingly
enthusiastic audiences no empty tables now
as the song ends we close on the cardboard stand up newly done over with a picture of susie and an accompanying exclamation see the sensational susie diamond
as the final chord sounds we jack and frank once again in the office of the supercilious lloyd waiting as he prepares their cash envelope
thats quite a girl you boys latched onto
she a local
born and bred
lucky for you
well there you go guys
dont spend it all in one place
you want to count it jack
we trust you lloyd
you know that
frank takes the envelope and begins to leave
since ive got you here
hows next week look for you guys
frank glances at jack giving it to him
jacks eyes go cold
well call you
as lloyds face drops jack and frank step into the hallway and begin to walk slowly away playing it cool then glance at one another and begin to walk faster
because theyre about to burst out laughing
by the time they reach the lobby they are laughing tripping across the carpet out the front entrance and onto the sidewalk where their voices explode in the night air
and they begin to do a weird boyish waltz together laughing giddily until they see standing under an awning lighting a cigarette susie watching them with raised eyebrows
jack and frank frozen in a clumsy embrace quickly disengage and begin clearing their throats and squaring their cuffs
susie exhales a plume of smoke studies them a moment then smiles slightly
as she turns away jack glances up watching her trim shadow disappear down the street
gray and cold
the streets swept with rain
and once again the tentative piano jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
oh what fun it is to ride
oh what fun it is to ride
oh what fun
jack and eddie are sitting in the waiting room small and dirty and packed with pet owners and their animals
after a moment a woman with a clipboard appears
no takers jock barker
realizing its him baker
bring him back
come on ed
jack and eddie follow the woman down a corridor
you shouldve brought a leash mr
the doctor doesnt like to be bitten
he doesnt bite
they never do mr
the woman points jack and eddie into a small room
there is an examining table a sink and on the wall a chart detailing the various breeds of dogs and cats
jack glances around the room then comes back to eddie whos staring up at him
you shoulda brushed pal
just then a man in a white coat breezes in
ah labradorus retreiverus
quiet but able to appreciate a good joke
beasley pats eddie on the side then turns to jack
whats our friends problem
whats wrong with them
theyre falling out
thats not good
lets get him up here
jack lifts eddie up onto the table and dr
beasley opens eddies mouth for a look
it doesnt take long
they gotta go
a take how many
fives my guess
wont know till i get in there
consulting his clipboard leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning
isnt there something you can give him
a pill or something
decay unfortunately doesnt limit itself to the denture mr
it spreads into his chest
then the heart goes
we wouldnt want that would we
how will he eat
start him out on cottage cheese
if youve got him on kibble just soak it a few minutes
go down like pudding through a hot pipe
jack looks at eddie
what do you do to him
dont worry mr
well knock him out
he wont feel a thing
i think maybe ill bring him back next week
the sooner we do this the better mr
jack steps out onto the rainy street alone
he glances back at the vets with second thought then moves slowly off
jack enters with a small grocery bag and opens the refrigerator
a carton of cream a few eggs theres not much there
he takes a small container of cottage cheese from the grocery bag and places it on an empty shelf
as he closes the refrigerator door he glances around the apartment
it is very still very quiet
he looks up at the ceiling absently then walks over to the window and looks out
there is a mug of coffee there on the sill
he takes it and holds it in both hands for a moment then places it back on the sill
he sits at the piano and runs his fingers lightly over the ivory not making a sound then places his hands on the keys and begins to play
in the front window room has been made among the photographs for one of susie
inside jack frank and susie sit at a table surrounded by empty coffee cups and cigarettes
frank has several slips of paper before him with names and dates
the twenty third
yeah here it is
we got the carlton or the plaza
four day turns
what do you think jack
jack is staring out the window
continuing jack you with us
the carltons a dump
and they water their drinks
its strictly for the fuller brush crowd
susie as she says this is pouring sugar into her coke
watching i guess its the plaza then
that brings us to the twenty seventh
we got the avedon for three or the park downtown for two
we take the avedon right
frank rubs his chin and looks at jack
jack shakes his head
continuing the park
its only two nights
why throw away a night
because blackie carson books the park and whenever weve needed a gig hes come through
lifting her glass well for blackie then
by the way i got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for new years action
likes resort hey
sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee
thats what i figure
probably have us in a bed and breakfast playing to the owls
maybe its legit
ill call him
make it collect
shuffling his slips thats it except for the first
we got the sheraton the ambassador or the holiday inn on sixtieth
all three day turns
frank looks at jack
howd you guys used to decide what gig to take
jack and frank exchange a glance
we flipped a coin
so find a dime
lets get out of here
jack and frank step out of the diner and turn their collars up against the chill
frank pulls on a pair of gloves
jesus its gonna be mean this year
wherere your gloves
continuing better take care of your fingers little brother
buy yourself a case of arthritis and you wont be able to play chopsticks
ill take my chances
frank pats his hands together and glances into the street
all those bids
well i gotta go
you wanna get a drink
frank stops surprised
little franks got strep
donnas been up two nights making sure the rest of us dont get it
continuing you all right
okay ill see you tomorrow night then
as frank leaves he takes a glance at his brother then disappears around the corner
a second later susie comes out of the diner
his kids sick
searching her purse i dont know
its hard figuring you two as brothers
seems like the hospital mightve scrambled the babies somewhere
he takes after our mother
yeah well a i know is mother nature must be one crazy dame
jack offers his pack of cigarettes
i never touch american cigarettes
still searching whats tomorrow again
even the bedspreads
shaking the purse damn
two fifty a pack and i go through em like toothpicks
twelve and a half cents a piece you believe that
twelve and a half cents
i sat down with a pencil and added it one day
but i figure if youre gonna be sticking something in your mouth you might as well make it the best
finding one ah heres a lost soul
jack lights it
she takes a draw
like kissing a rose
well au revoir
as she stops you feel like a cup of coffee
we mustve killed three pots in there
anyway i gotta get home
rest the pipes
you want me to walk you
susie looks at jack a little funny
she starts to move away then stops and looks back
continuing hey listen
youre not going soft on me are you
i mean youre not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like im some kinda princess when i burp
i mean thatd be too creepy
with us working together and all
nothing personal jack holds up his hand
susie just stands there
youre a nickel down on your cigarette
jack paces outside the veterinary clinic rubbing his arms against the nights chill
he glances up at the flickering sign over the building twenty four hour emergency care
inside a kid with deep set eyes is bent over a magazine
jack hesitates then enters
jack glances around ill at ease
continuing you want something pal
if youre looking for a bathroom try the super chief around the corner
the kid goes back to his magazine
no i uh left a dog here this morning
he needed some work on his mouth
regular hours are eight to five
yeah yeah i know
i was just passing by
thought id check in on him
you can check in on him tomorrow
between eight and five
yeah well couldnt i take a look now
the kid looks up at jack with mild contempt
you want to know if hes okay
the names baker save it
whats he look like
they lay the dead ones out in the cold room
ill take a look
the kid disappears into the back
jack stands frozen watching the swinging door come to rest
he looks like a man who unexpectedly finds a razor pressed to his neck
he fumbles for a cigarette but doesnt light it
a moment later the door swings open
just a couple poodles
jack nods then moving stiffly leaves
outside he reaches into his coat and takes the bottle
on the floor a long line of bowls each containing a different concoction all intended for the ailing eddie
eddie lying a few feet away shows no interest
in the kitchen jack is heating something up in a pan
i tried cheerios this morning
he didnt even get up
maybe they took out the wrong teeth
hes just feeling sorry for himself
this is it pal
two bucks a can
jack dumps some brown slop into a bowl and places it next to the others
nina and he wait
at first nothing then eddies eyes move
his nose twitches
his head lifts
finally he gets up and walks to the bowl
draped in winter
dark skies people lost in heavy coats the citys battered christmas decorations hung tenuously across traffic clogged streets
over it all we hear jingle bells played for the first time completely through hesitantly but without error
as the song ends we are watching nina strike the final chord triumphantly
she turns to jack whos been listening from the couch
nodding to the ceiling youre gonna knock her dead kid
all done up in reds and greens for christams eve
jack frank and susie each decked out in their own little santa hats perform silver bells for the happy crowd
jack smoking a cigarette will not be mistaken for santa claus but susie looks adorable
frank just looks happy
as they finish the crowd applauds
jack now sans santa hat enters the bathroom off the lobby and finds santa claus standing in front of the mirror fussing with his beard
you recognized me
just a lucky guess
so what do you think
not buying it yeah well what can i say
dad mustve had forty pounds on me
jesus you remember him being this big
jack looks in the mirror
well the lines growing weaker little brother
lucky for us there arent any dragons left to slay
jack and frank step out into the lobby thus giving a few people susie among them the curious privilege of seeing santa claus exit a mens room
you want to come out to the house tomorrow
the way the bookings been piling up donnas decided to really lay it on
turkey stuffing the whole bit
kitchens so full of food you can hardly move
we could use another appetite
thanks but ive got plans
all right but if you change your mind let me know
i gotta go get ma in the morning anyway
coming up well well
ho ho ho
you moonlighting at macys frank
for the kids
moving off merry christmas you two
we leave the twenty sixth
frank pushes through the revolving door and steps out into the street in his santa suit
he do that every year
arent the kids asleep
so whys he do it
i guess in case one year theyre not
jack looks into susies eyes then crosses to the door and exits
susie watches him go then turns to the desk clerk
call me a cab will ya
as jack enters his apartment he senses a presence in the room and looks over to the old phone booth
nina is sitting inside on the little stool her head tilted against the glass
jack studies her a moment then takes the carton of eggnog hes carrying into the kitchen and grabs a pair of glasses
he pulls a chair over to the phone booth and sits down
howd the show go
howd yours go
not so good
jack looks at ninas face tender and young in the soft shadows of the booth
after a moment her eyes shift to the carton in his hand
continuing from hurleys
what dya say
think you can handle it
jack begins to fill the two glasses
can i stay here tonight
even if she comes here
jack pauses a moment then closes the carton and sets it aside
he hands nina her glass then takes his own
merry christmas jack
jack and nina are standing in the middle of the room looking down at something
what do you think
eddie outfitted in a brand new spanking red dog sweater stares up at jack and nina wondering why hes the object of so much attention
sporting his new sweater make their way across an empty cemetery
nina is swinging a bottle of whiskey
looking around there were more flowers last year
rinaldi down at the drugstore says its going to snow by new years
says he can feel it in his elbows
i hope it snows
i want to make a snowman
you ever make a snowman jack
thats what i want to do
i want to make a snowman
as they come to a plot of ground they stop
there are two matching headstones one for jacks father fully engraved and another for jacks mother bearing only her name
jack studies the plot a moment then crouches before his fathers marker andrew s
adoring husband of eleanor loving father of franklin and john
jack brushes some dirt from the face of the stone then stands
nina uncaps the whiskey bottle and pours it onto the dead mans grave
continuing merry christmas mr
they stand another moment just looking then turn away
as they begin to walk jack sees eddie in his new sweater sniffing at a gravestone
have some respect will ya
jack is sitting on a suitcase in front of his building
a moment later frank pulls the car up to the curb and jack gets in
susie is sitting up front
frank burning with the afterglow of a holiday spent with family cheerfully maneuvers the car through the city
how was everyones christmas
jack and susie stare disconsolately out the window
continuing too early huh
well theres coffee and donuts for whoever wants them
how about a maple bar jack
jack shakes his head and takes out a cigarette
continuing uh jack
if you dont mind
jack stares at the back of franks head then puts the cigarette away
susie takes a peek in the donut bag and looks a little sick
continuing by the way if anyone gets bored donna packed some travel games
they work wonders with the kids
frank reaches under the seat and hands susie a sack full of magnetic games puzzles and plastic cubes
continuing you two could play checkers
maybe we should just listen to the radio
it only plays static
susie looks at the radio then at the games in her hands
how long did you say it takes to get to this place
jack is staring out the window at the winter landscape an unlit cigarette dangling from his lip
susie is gnawing on a donut deeply obsessed with an elaborate plastic puzzle
any more coffee
susie snaps out of her trance and shakes the thermos
hey whats this
susie notices an old leather bound ledger
inside there are hundreds of tiny entries
continuing you play all these places
jesus you fellasve made a lot of noise
whats with the stars
hey look at this
a crepe covered car surrounded by several other honking vehicles passes by
jack stares at the beaming newlyweds as they glide past his window two kids starting life in a beat up eldorado covered with toilet paper
continuing whens the last time we played a wedding jack
two years ago
consulting the ledger hes right
hes always right
pick a virgin
susie looks at frank curiously
continuing go ahead
scanning the book okay
the fantasy inn
staring out the window november
i dont believe it
i told you hes got the gift
same with music
hears it once and hes got it
frank smiles into the rear view mirror
continuing my brilliant little brother
the hotel done in a sort of king arthur motif is built right on the ocean
frank guides the car down a simulated cobblestone drive and the three get out
will you listen to that ocean
frank takes a deep breath
continuing and how about this air
im telling you a few days in this placell put five years on your life
smells like fish
of course it smells like fish
were on the ocean
whatd you expect chanel number five
to herself smells like tuna number two to me
thats what it is
as susie and jack follow frank up the drive jack notices the beat up eldorado in the parking lot its toilet paper streamers blowing gently in the ocean breeze
the lobby is done in royal reds and blues and there are a lot of swords on the walls
franks steps up to the front desk
hi were the fabulous baker boys
glad to meet you
im terrific tom
were the entertainment
oh right gotcha
you got bags
ringing a bell cyril
take em up to the guinevere suite
a lanky boy in velvet jodhpurs and high stockings ambles out for the bags
tom hands frank the room keys
continuing right on the ocean mr
you can practically dangle your toes in the water
tom wasnt kidding
the immediacy of the ocean beyond the window is almost scary
you believe this
im telling you were getting away with murder
two shows a night and the rest of the time we live like kings
its a crime
jack stares at the ocean then at the two beds placed side by side
suddenly susie comes through the bathroom
hey were connected
susie shrugs and returns to her room through the bathroom
i thought we had separate rooms
opening drawers we do
shes got hers weve got ours
wash and dries
i thought we all had separate rooms
come on jack
its not like its the first time weve bunked together
itll be like when we were kids
enjoy the view
jack frank and susie are in the dining room which like their rooms looks out over the ocean
dinner is over and theyre well through a second bottle of wine
youre kidding me
as charlie steinway is my witness
she was staying at the grand downtown
it was april
that one i remember
we were playing the lounge one night and she came in
frank asked if shed sit in for a song she said yes and we did a few bars
a few bars
whatd she sing
you think streisand right
hot that night
through the whole audience
i could hardly play
you ever see her again
we got a picture though
one of the waitresses had a camera
to jack god we were just kids
that was something wasnt it
frank shakes his head still lost in the spring evening years before then notices the newlyweds sitting across the room
continuing hey will you look at that
they mustve bought the same map we did
what do you say we send a bottle over
i dont believe it
youre a romantic frank
besides jacks the romantic
hes just afraid to show it
arent you little brother
have some more wine frank
lifting his glass to peggy lee
frank standing dressed in pajamas
jack is staring out the window at the darkness
im putting my stuff on the right okay
i figure that way we wont get confused
unless you want the right
no you take the right
we might as well do the towels the same way
i just figure thingsll go smoother you know if we have it all worked out from the beginning
but if it doesnt work out let me know
frank nods and moves to the bed
continuing re the bathroom light you leaving that on
were gonna be here a week
so youre gonna leave it on
for a week
why would i mind
i dont know
i mean i always did it as a kid
i figured it was no big deal
a big deal
jack just stares at frank
i didnt know
i mean i always did it as a kid
it was never a big deal then
jack just stares at frank
you want me to turn it off
jack just stares at frank
continuing ill turn it off
jack turns back to the window
its no big deal
the next morning
jack and frank are standing in a huge dining room appraising two elegant grands
theyre beauties huh
jack steps up to one and runs his hand over the keys
continuing reminds me of those steinways willie used to have
frank taps a few notes on his piano humming happily
jack begins to echo his brothers notes listening
after a moment frank notices
a short stubby little man in a charcoal suit strides into the dining room followed by terrific tom
good morning gentlemen
daniels the manager
i believe ive spoken to one of you on the phone
offering his hand thatd be me sir
this is my brother jack
jack slouched against the piano smoking nods
tom here tells me theres a problem with the pianos
we were assured they were in tune
yes well they are
then im afraid i dont understand
they are in tune
but not with each other
is that important
frank glances nervously at jack
tom whore we dealing with on these
but hes gone on vacation
i called this morning
well gentlemen i dont know what to say
not being a musician myself i find it difficult to grasp the magnitude of this
i dont suppose theres any way you could just
i dont think i know what you mean
i think what mr
daniels is trying to say jack is why dont we let mr
daniels tell us what hes trying to say
i assure you mr
baker no offense is intended
i simply mean well were not a symphony are we
frank dogs jack down a hallway
youre acting like a kid

stopping christ cant you hear it
i never hear it

i dont know
but i wont let it bother me
doesnt it matter to you
what matters to me is weve got the six easiest nights weve had in ten years
so tie a yellow ribbon sounds a little flat
nobodys gonna hear it jack
so why should you care
because i can hear it
well then stuff cotton in your ears because come six oclock were gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on
understand little brother
frank is adjusting his tie in the bathroom mirror
jack sitting at the window his foot up against the glass drinks from a flask as the sky above the ocean goes dark
after a moment susie enters wearing a little tuxedo of her own and begins to brush her hair
whats the word
continuing whats with you two
jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle
susie looks at jack
as jack frank and susie perform strangers in the night dozens of couples move slowly on the dance floor while others sit at candle lit tables sipping cocktails
as the song ends the couples applaud
thank you thank you
as applause dies you know susie and jack and i only just arrived here yesterday but already the people here at the king corporations moorish manor have made us feel
well a part of the family
and its their hope that before you leave everyone of you will feel a part of that family also
so if during the next few days we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever
dont be a stranger
because here there are no strangers only friends
i love you frank
i love you
i just wanted to say it
frank stares incredulously at jack
uh well i love you too jack
moving quickly along so
how bout it
got another song for us
i gotta bunch of them
frank corners jack as they exit the stage
susie looks around nervously to see if anyones watching
whispering whats the matter with you
im sorry frank
all that talk about family
i just got emotional
how dare you say you love me
it wont happen again
whats with you guys
someone needs to grow up
i wont take it jack
sure you will
jack pushes past frank and leaves
frank watches him go then turns to leave himself
middle of the night
jack fully clothed is sitting on the rim of the tub smoking
with the light always on its hard to tell
the cigarette last one
in and out
its the waves
gods music my mother used to say
she was crazy for the ocean
yeah well i wish god would go a little easy on the trumpets
like a baby
in and out
susie looks at him carefully
continuing if you want i got a pack in the room
i never touch french cigarettes
the next morning
as jack passes through the lobby he hears the plaintive plinking of a piano
curious he goes to the dining room and peers in
the tables have yet to be set for the evening and except for frank the room is empty
what the hell are you doing
not looking up whats it look like im doing
im tuning a goddamn piano
i dont want you to be unhappy jack
if you say its out of tune its out of tune
jack smiles to himself and crosses the room
hows it coming
how long you been at it
shrugging half hour
once i finish this octave im gonna get breakfast
you see whats on the buffet
they stopped serving two hours ago
two hours ago
time flies huh
frank looks despairingly at the pianos
continuing i could give you a hand
if you want
jack and frank are eating lunch
frank has a tiny stack of blue cards hes perusing
he holds one out to jack
what do you make that
frank continues to go through the cards as he speaks
continuing you havent seen susie have you
just wonder what shes up to
i never see her
makes me nervous
shes a big girl
yeah well shes our girl now
i think we better keep an eye on her
theres trouble there
another card hey listen to this
ethel and bert lane
married seventy five years
you believe that
what the hell are these
i came up with the idea on the road
see every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room
the guest fills out the card leaves it at the front desk and that night we play it
daniels went crazy for the idea
whispering and thats not all
last night after the nine oclock he corners me right and starts asking about our availability
like he wants to line something up
i think hes got a hard on for susie
a woman in a bright flowered gift shop dress pokes her head in
im sorry to interrupt but when i saw you sitting here i just had to come over
this is my brother
oh i know i know
my husband and i saw you play last night and its the most remarkable thing
well thank you
no i mean you
to jack i have a brother in law who looks exactly like you
you dont happen to have a huckleberry in your family tree do you
well its frightening
you could be his twin
of course he doesnt have your talent
musically i mean
he sharpens things for a living
lawn mower blades kitchen knives anything with an edge
jack is having a hard time imagining florence simmons
continuing well anyway i just had to make sure there was no relation
you play wonderfully
both of you
florence simmons gives a little flutter of a wave and exits
thinking theres someone who looks like you walking around the street somewhere
smiling wonder if i saw him id think it was you
jack is standing on the walkway that encircles the hotel watching the waves tumble into one another
as he starts to take out a cigarette he notices florence simmons standing a few yards away with a camera
i just know my sister wont believe me
do you mind
jack shakes his head and florence starts to aim the camera
i really hate to impose
its just that the resemblance is so extraordinary
focusing i wonder if you could turn this way so your face isnt in the shadows
as jack turns he glances over florences swaying shoulder and sees susie and a man standing at the other end of the walkway
they are leaning into the wind her hair blowing free brushing the mans face
the camera clicks
would you like a copy for yourself
the hotel develops
jack glances away from susie and the man
on jacks expression applause is heard and a moment later we that evening
the trio has just finished a song and those on the dance floor are clapping
you know before we came out here this evening susie and jack and i were looking over your dedications and something struck us
susie and jack look at frank as if they have no idea what hes talking about
continuing we realized that well were really not so different from one another after all
oh sure we may be at different points in our journey but we all travel pretty much the same road
and so with that in mind wed like to introduce you to two very special couples
first married for all of two days please say hello to helen and bud wilson
those standing on the dance floor applaud as the young couple from the beat up eldorado make their way to the front of the room
continuing and now our second couple
im talking about ethel and bert lane ladies and gentlemen
now ethel and bert would be upset with me if i told you theyd been married for fifty years
because ladies and gentlemen ethel and bert lane have been married for seventy five years
the audience lets go with an audible ooh and applauds enthusiastically
continuing ethel bert
get up here and show these kids how its done
a path is cleared and a tiny couple begins to make their way to the dance floor
continuing arent they a sight
they are indeed and a sight slower getting to the dance floor than frank anticipated
he nods to jack and they launch into the anniversary waltz but have to keep repeating the opening passage while they wait for ethel and bert
finally everyone on the dance floor steps back and with some help from a few waiters who slide a section of tables out of the way ethel and bert lane
begin to dance in the center of the room slowly but wonderfully while the younger couple whirls around them like a youthful satellite
jack is sitting in the bathroom again smoking
he hears susies door open then voices hers and a mans
he puts out his cigarette in the sink and leaves
the next morning
frank the early bird is returning to the room with a newspaper under his arm
whistling happily he rounds the corner just in time to see a man exit susies room
astonished then outraged he goes to susies door and knocks sharply
opening door forget your tie handsome
you want to tell me what the hells going on
i just saw a man walk out of your room
in case youve forgotten were being paid to be here
so it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency
hey listen pal
i had my doubts about you from the beginning hey
frank and susie turn
jack is standing in the hallway
continuing whatre you trying to do
wake up the whole goddamn hotel
we were just having a little discussion about morality
i just saw a man walk out of your room
you saw wrong
hes with the hotel
i called him
what are you talking about
we had a leak in the bathroom
he fixed it
he was wearing a suit
he had to come quickly
it was a big leak
how come i didnt hear anything
youre a heavy sleeper frank
youve always been a heavy sleeper
looking at susie unlike me
frank looks at jack then susie
i guess i
if i jumped to
the three stand there awkwardly for a moment
frank shrugs lamely and exits
boy he comes on like a hurricane in the morning doesnt he
jack just stares at her
continuing yeah well thanks for sticking your head in
hey business is business
he turns to leave
susies eyes narrow
it wasnt business
it was pleasure
just dinner and dance right
jack frank and susie are sitting at a table in the smaller dining room
it is conspicuously quiet
the main course seems to be a conscious attempt to ignore each other
finally susie looks at frank
then out the window
jack and franks room
it is new years eve just before show time and jack and frank are in their tuxes
frank is on the phone
into phone yes daddy promises
ill bring you one of the little glasses hows that
just like grandma has
it has a picture of the hotel on it and everything no honey they dont sell puppies here
well well see

tell him tell him
i cant wait to see
no no new bike

listen honey i have to go
were on in ten minutes
yeah happy new year
i love you
frank sets the phone down and stares at it
jack studies him a moment then frank suddenly claps his hands
continuing well lets go
the public waits
a mass of swarming jubilant people
the voices are high and loud and theres not a hand without a champagne glass
couples lean into one another intimately dancing gaily between the tables toasting strangers without hesitation
yelling to be heard all right everyone
this is it
lets hear it
gradually the entire room joins the chant
there is a blizzard of confetti as people scramble to find that certain someone to kiss in the new year
in this moment jack frank and susie find themselves oddly removed from the frantic cheer below them their presence suddenly unnecessary forgotten
finally susie walks over to frank and gives him a kiss then goes to jack
they hesitate then kiss lightly pulling away and glancing awkwardly into each others eyes
frank sounds the first chord of auld lang syne and susie looks away from jack and returns to her place on the stage
as she begins to sing the others in the room all intimate friends for one brief moment begin to sing with her
lest old acquaintances be forgot
as the voices slowly fade they are joined by the sound of the ocean until the ocean is all we hear and we see jack lying on his bed in
he opens his eyes squinting against the light from the bathroom then glances over to franks bed and detects the outline of a body in the darkness
swinging his legs over the side he sits up on the edge of the bed and rubs his eyes
suddenly there is a rustle of blankets and the shadow in the next bed shifts falling into the shaft of light cast from the bathroom
it is a little boy
startled jack stares at the sleeping boy then hears movement in the bathroom
rising slowly he walks to the bathroom and gently eases the door open a few inches
inside swimming murkily in the steamy mirror is the reflection of a man
his back is to jack but jack can see that the man is shaving
as jack lets his gaze drop to the floor he sees that water is dripping off the mans pant cuffs and gathering in pools on the bathroom floor
jack wakes up
he stares at the ceiling listening to the waves then lifts his head and looks to the bathroom
it is dark
turning he glances at franks bed
dark and soundless
balloons streamers and the other debris of revelry cover the tables and floor like snow
frank is sitting at the window drinking as he stares at the ocean
as jack crosses the room he looks up
ah well if it isnt the lad with the golden ear
happy new year little brother
whatre you doing down here
the partys over
no youre wrong
its just beginning
come on have a drink
show your big brother how its done
frank pours him a glass
jack notices the bottle
courtesy of our courteous hotel manager mr
toasting jack we dear brother are a fucking smash
they want us back
it seems they have this egg hunt every year
only not for kids
they stuff these plastic eggs with timexes and little certificates for free mai tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn
then afterwards they have a dance
an egg dance
everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open
its our job to separate the yolks from the whites
frank smiles as he takes a swallow of his drink then leans his head back staring at the ceiling
continuing you know ive never kissed my wife on new years
not once in twelve years
jack studies frank as he stares at the ceiling
the holmby has a chandelier like that doesnt it
with the blue glass
jack looks up at the chandelier
whens the last time we were there
its incredible how you do that
a useless talent
drove me crazy when we were kids
the way you never looked at the music
miss simpson would just play it and
frank snaps his fingers
they were simple songs
not for me
i still have to look at the music sometimes you know that
otherwise i forget
i just forget
you never forget
turning so how come you couldnt remember mas birthday
i told you
its a useless talent
frank studies jack a moment then stares out at the ocean
god the old man wouldve loved this view wouldnt he
i always think of him on new years
how he used to pour us each half a can of beer
you always threw up
yeah and you drank yours like it was orange juice
he loved that about you
he was just having fun
it was like youd passed some test you know
it was just a can of beer frank
yeah but he told you things
he never told me anything
even though i was the oldest
it was always you two running off doing things together
you couldve come
but he didnt want me to
youre making things up frank
pause you ever go back there
where it happened
jack stares at the angry sea loud even through the thick glass
the next morning
jack is sitting outside the hotel watching helen and bud wilson pack up the eldorado
the streamers by now turned to mush cling like oatmeal to the cars exterior
after a moment frank exits with a little bag from the gift shop and pulls out a tiny souvenir shot glass
jack shakes his head
continuing ah well the kidsll break a couple anyway
suddenly across the parking lot the voices of the newlyweds are heard
give me the keys
youre not going to drive
give me the keys
youre not going to drive
its my goddamn car
its our goddamn car
give me the keys
bud hesitates then makes a rush for his wife but shes too quick and runs to the other side of the car
frustrated he begins to run around the car like a madman trying to catch her
finally when he gets close she darts off sprinting across the parking lot
i think ill warm up the car
cold dark dangerous but somehow looking quite appealing after a week in paradise
the trio looking road weary is parked in front of jacks building
it is very late
that takes care of this week
the tenth we got the sheraton the sixteenth were at the capri
the tenths out
i cant make the tenth
what do you mean
i mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance
be reasonable jack
i play two hundred nights a year with you frank
how much more reasonable you expect me to be
jack gets out of the car
frank shakes his head in exasperation then looks to susie
how about you
got a bar mitzvah this weekend
jack lets himself in and closes the door quietly
in the darkness he can make out nina and eddie curled up on the couch asleep
above them hung carefully on a string are some paper letters in a lounge whols basic decor makes abundant use of several historical eras but which might best be described
as modern pilgrim jack susie and frank perform feelings while waiters in huge paul revere hats pass in and out of view
wo wo wo
feelings wo wo wo
jack frank and susie exit the lounge to applause
i cant sing it anymore
i cant sing it anymore
im gonna get sick
whatre you talking about
they love it
im gonna throw up frank
i mean it
lets drop it for the ten oclock okay
as to a child susie
its one more show
one more time
and two more times tomorrow night and two more times the next night and the next night and the next night and the next night
frank i cant sing that fucking song anymore
the kitchen workers are glancing over
jack studies her as she tries to calm herself
continuing i need some air
a few minutes later
jack comes out of the hotel and sees susie pacing
he sits down and watches her for a moment
youre gonna wear down those heels if you dont give it a rest
well drop the song
guess i got a little scattered
its a shitty song
susie nods and looks up at the glittering hotel
how do you do it
pause there are worse songs you know
not many but a few
jack studies her
somethings on her mind
looks into his eyes nothing
a record is spinning on jacks phonograph as the sun goes down outside his window
as we move away from the phonograph and past the window we find jack at the piano playing along with the record lost in concentration
susie is working on a paris opal pacing occasionally glancing up at jacks apartment where the music can be heard faintly
after a moment she drops her cigarette on the sidewalk
there are half a dozen others already there
the record finishes but the needle doesnt pick up bumping into the label
jack glances at the clock next to him and gets up
he puts on a jacket then takes a pair of gloves and pulls them on carefully
as jack comes out of his building susie stops pacing surprised
jack wearing the same look of concentration he had at the piano doesnt see her and turns down the other end of the street
susie starts to call after him but stops
the sun is gone now and the moon is in the sky
we see the hot neon exterior of a tiny jazz club
jack is sitting in the shadows near the stage where a trio is playing
he has a drink in front of him but it is untouched
after a moment the trio finishes and the pianist a huge black man named henry nods to the applause
as most of you know we like to shake things up here every so often just to keep you people on your toes
so im gonna take a little rest grab myself a drink and let an old friend sit in
he drops by about once a year just to keep his hands clean
ladies and gentlemen
jack rises to polite applause and shakes henrys hand
as he settles behind the piano he sits for a moment not moving then nods to the two men behind him
as they begin to play we recognize the music from the record
jack waits then brings his hands to the keys
as he plays his face is suddenly calm
jack comes out of the club and into the night lighting a cigarette as he moves up the street
you were good
i can keep the beat
better than that
jacks face goes a little cold but he says nothing beginning to walk again
whats the matter
whatd i say
im not upset
all i said was you were good
you dont know good
whats that supposed to mean
it means you wouldnt know good if it came up and fucked you
you were good
lets make a deal
you shut up
you were good
exasperated how do you know
yelling because i saw the other people
and they knew you were good
you were good goddamnit
jack studies susie then glances off
for a moment they just stand on the corner not talking
continuing so you wanna get a drink
whats she look like
maybe i can help you find her
shes four feet tall
how many people live here
eddie walks around the couch and looks curiously at susie
jack moves to the kitchen
i have to make him some chili
a look sure
light from a weak lamp lots of shadows as romantic as jacks apartment will ever get
outside the window the city looks like a thousand jewels gleaming
susie cradles a drink in her hand as she moves slowly about the room slipping in and out of the shadows as if they were veils
at window like diamonds huh
i never get over it
when i was a little girl my mamad stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish
like i could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into a necklace for myself
shed take my hand and when she closed her eyes i dont know it was like she really believed it
how come you didnt close your eyes
she looks surprised by the question
i dont know
i guess i didnt trust the night like she did
susie finishes her drink and sets it down
continuing let me have a cigarette will you
all of mine are down there on the sidewalk
jack looks at her curiously
continuing long story
jack gives her an american cigarette and lights it
continuing you know i saw you guys once
you and frank
at the roosevelt
mustve been a cheap date
yeah they got a convention for everything
at least he was clean
boy the guys i met when i was with the service you wouldnt believe
the older ones they were okay
pulled the chair out for you
but the younger ones
shaking her head mama used to say dance with a man once but if you can feel calluses on his fingers dont dance with him again
she thought she had it all figured out
but she wasnt so smart
there are killers with palms like a baby
susie takes a long draw and blows the smoke out slowly
continuing it wasnt so bad though
id get a nice piece of steak flowers sometimes even a gift
usually whatever the guy was into
got a socket set once
the guy looked like held just given me four dozen roses
almost wistful but i stayed at the hartford once
you should see the rooms
all satin and velvet
and the bed
royal blue trimmed in lace clean as snow
hard to believe sleeping in a room like that dont change your life
but it dont
the bed may be magic but the mirror isnt
you wake up the same old susie
pause i didnt always you know
if i liked the guy
susie looks at jack but he just takes a drink
she looks out the window again
continuing sometimes i wish the sun would never come up
she stares at the lights another moment then turns and nods to the phone booth
continuing so whats this
jack frowns takes another drink
my father proposed to my mother in there
its a small phone booth
continuing the both of them
he called her
so whats it doing here
you sending me home
jack locks eyes with susie then glances away
theyd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station she lived over in brookhaven
usually held ride with her but this time he didnt
anyway he starts walking home only as hes walking he starts getting nervous
by the time he gets to the corner newstand hes got her meeting some rich guy on the train the rich guys asked her to marry him and hes reading
about it in the morning edition
he had a mind that escalated things
so what happened
he calls her asks her to marry him she thinks hes crazy he asks her again she still thinks hes crazy but says yes anyway and the next thing you
know hes got his brothers down there and theyre tearing the thing right off the curb
continuing i dont know
maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her
but i still dont see how
ma didnt want it around
jack glances out the window
continuing carefully frank said you saw him die
jack glances up quickly surprised
continuing frank said frank wasnt there
susie stops looks down
jack studies her for a moment then decides
he took me out to the docks one day
we did that a lot
there were other places but he loved the ocean
hed worked boats as a kid
never got rid of it
it was always in him
hed drink a little when wed go
if he drank enough hed do this funny irish jig
to make me laugh
pause he drank a lot that day
susie studies jack as he stares into his glass
continuing there was a lot of wind
he was up on this cargo shelf right over the ocean
and he started to do the jig
one minute he was there
shrugs i thought it was a joke at first
he did things like that
pause i was laughing when it happened
jack stares at the glass in his hands then glances up and catches susie looking at him
you got pretty eyes you know that
in the darkness we see susies profile her eyes looking up toward the ceiling
jacks body falls slowly across her and he kisses her neck
we see eddie wearing his christmas sweater sleeping on the fire escape
susie is dressed sitting at the piano staring out the window as she absently hits a key
she is smoking one of jacks cigarettes
jack comes to the doorway and watches her
you gotta move em around if you want to play a song
susie starts looks at her hand on the piano pulls it away
look if you want to leave
god i hate these cigarettes
susie throws the cigarette out the window then looks down
i think i started a fire
if our feet get hot you grab the piano
susie smiles weakly
continuing why dont you go
ill see you tomorrow night at the ambassador
susie doesnt move
i followed you last night
i mean i was here
i was about to come up when you came out
continuing the reason i came by
i couldnt tell frank
susie stares up at jack but he says nothing
continuing its a
i met this guy at the resort
he liked my voice
he thinks i can sell cat food just by singing about it
can you believe it
susie tries a laugh
continuing you can always get another girl
looks out window theres always another girl
jack and frank stand in a lounge talking to nick the manager
busboys move in and out preparing the room for the evening
so shes got a few sniffles
nick frowns looking at the two pianos across the room
you got no right springing this on me frankie
you want us to pack up well pack up
what am i gonna do
put a record player out there
exiting bad frankie
to frank whatre you doing
just until we find another girl
you want to know how much i got tied up in deposits with willie
were in for three weeks solid jack
better give her pneumonia
jack and frank find themselves in the back room of willies again
they do not look happy
jack and frank look up
a girl in a yellow and black dress is in the doorway
she looks like a bumblebee
i came in the last time you guys were looking for a singer
first rule of show business
jack and frank just stare at her
i bought a book
thats what it says
frank is looking at a list
we got the roosevelt on thursday the park in a couple of weeks
larry shelton said hed let me know by friday on the ambassador
frank folds the paper carefully
continuing i got some calls out
things that might be good for us
frank looks over at jack for the first time
hes leaning against the building staring at his shoes
continuing well try for a girl again next week
well the roosevelt then
once grand now dark and dusty looking
a small crowd
you know my brother and i have been playing together gosh i dont know
twenty eight years
bored brutally indifferent faces
of course uh back then it was uh a little different
we were just kids
just about the only one who would listen to us was the family cat cecil
we mustve shaved three lives off old cecil huh jack
frank laughs and his voice eerily magnified by the microphone is the only sound in the room
continuing hanging tough yeah well anyway
its nice to be back here in the roosevelt room because this has always been
frank falters as he sees mrs
baker enter the lounge and seat herself at a table in the back of the room
jack follows franks eyes and spots her
continuing a very special place for jack and i
recovering and tonight wed like to open with a very special song
its the song my mother and father danced to the night they were married
this is for them
jack watches as frank gives mrs
baker a hug
you shouldve told us you were coming ma
we wouldve come and got you
spur of the moment
so whatd you think
glancing at jack both of you
the audience was a little off tonight
a few empty tables
besides mel torme couldnt fill this place on a wednesday night
i guess youre right
well what do you say we get a little midnight snack
theos should still be open
you boys are tired
no were not
i should get home
nodding just call me a cab
ma come on
my cars just a half block down
you wait here
smiling all right
frank dashes out of the lobby
jack and mrs
baker watch him go then turn to each other
baker smiles awkwardly then surveys the lobby
continuing its beautiful isnt it
the brocade on the walls has faded and the chairs once covered with velvet now with a cheap imitation look old and dowdy but the room still maintains an elegant
this was quite a place once
after the war
on friday nights they had dances in the ballroom upstairs
it was beautiful
orchids floating in the punch bowls
it was a wonderful place to be young
jack watches his mother as her eyes pass over the room
after a moment she nods toward the lounge
continuing it went well tonight
frank works hard
and you dont
he leads i follow
is that the way it is
he mentioned you had a girl for a while
for a while
yes well its probably best
no sense bringing someone else in
baker glances into the lounge at the two pianos
watching tonight i was remembering when you were young
how i used to stand in the kitchen listening to the two of you practice while i did the dishes
smiling my two little radios
sometimes id stop and go to the door and just watch
sometimes your father would too
pause he liked to listen to you play
did you know that
jack shakes his head
continuing you miss him dont you
its been a long time ma
pause i supposed you still have that old phone booth
baker smiles then it fades
continuing his love scared me you know
the day he died he left a flower on my pillow
jack looks puzzled
suddenly his mother reaches out and very gently touches her fingers to his face
continuing you look so like him
they stand like this for a moment connnected then frank steps in from the street
your limos ready ma
baker takes her hand from jacks face and turns away
just before she exits she looks back
continuing good night jack
jack walking home turns a corner and suddenly stops
across the street talking to a man is susie
she says a few words to the man then touches him lightly on the arm and begins to walk away
jack watches her retreat then follows moving quicker as he draws close
as he reaches her he gently touches her elbow and she turns
the woman stares at jack startled
for a moment he doesnt move
finally he lets go of her elbow
a few nights later
frank guides the car through wet city streets
its two am and raining hard
were not getting paid then
we get nothing
i told you jack
its a telethon
no one gets a cent
a pause whats it for
i dont know
i dont know
you dont know
its a disease jack
were against it
its not a moral decision
another pause what channels it on
seventy one seventy one
whats seventy one
defensive a channel
its just a little further down the dial thats all
look its publicity
jack stares at frank
jack and frank make their way down a hallway
the guy said to find studio e and turn right
whats that say
suddenly a rapid fire thumping sound resounds through the corridor
as jack and frank turn they see a huge youth in a wheelchair dribbling a basketball toward them
jack and frank step back and watch the kid one wheel it around the corner
i guess its that way
jerry lewis need not fear
this is strictly a tin foil and crepe paper operation
along one wall is the phone bank monitored by a few sleepy volunteers and opposite in makeshift bleachers is the audience
a huge tote board set on rolling astors is next to the phones
the total at am is
as jack and frank enter the kid in the wheelchair is doing basketball tricks before the camera
this must be it
ill see when were on
jack glances around the studio like hes walked into a nightmare
at the phone bank a heavyset man in a sweatshirt and a cap looks over
both the sweatshirt and the cap have earl printed on them
you the magician
what do you do
jack points to the pianos across the room
hopeful two at a time
my brother and i
disappointed again oh
indicating the kid in the wheelchair whats wrong with the kid
tore it up against st
right before the accident
the way were going well be lucky to buy a carton of jockstraps let alone a new gym
as jack registers this earls phone rings
frank returns and gestures to the kid in the wheelchair
were on after meadowlark
seeing jacks face whats wrong
are you kidding me
are you fucking kidding me
were playing for a goddamn gymnasium
before jack can further enlighten frank the kid in the wheelchair rolls off and a guy in a cheap rented tux strides in front of the camera
hes vince nancy the host
lets hear it for our own jimmy marshall shall we
the audience applauds
continuing as most of youknow young jimmy put a nasty twist on that knee trying to win one for good ol grant high this year
luckily the doctors tell us jimmyll be able to play next season
if there is a next season
uncle sam thats where you come in
pick up that phone
make a donation
lets keep our kids off the streets and in the gym where they belong
continuing all right

i think youll agree with me when i tell you were in for a real treat when i say that we have with us

vince gestures grandly to the left and jack and frank enter from the right
continuing whoops there they are
hey nice suits fellas
to camera now i know a lot of you amateur musicians out there are going to want to rap with these guys and dont worry
right after they finish up here theyre going to be manning the phones
maybe we can even convince them to raffle off a few piano lessons if were lucky
what do you think
the audience applauds
jack glares at frank
continuing well all right then
what are we waiting for
take it away guys
jack and frank poise their hands over their pianos and begin to play
as the music rises the studio becomes very quiet almost still
unfortunately jack and frank are barely through the opening passage when a thunderously loud bell begins to ring
suddenly vince steps out again
continuing uh oh
we know what that means dont we
its time to turn the board over
to jack frank im afraid you fellasll just have to wait a minute
lets bring out the board
two post pubescent giants roll out the tote board right in front of jack and frank
jack looks positively homicidal
jack kicks out the piano bench and starts to leave
then seeing the kid in the wheelchair he grabs the basketball and fires it at vince
what the pointing youre a fucking creep you know that
i oughta kick your ass
whispering jack youre on television
shut up frank
earl of the sweatshirt and cap puts his hand on jacks shoulder
what do you say we go for a walk pal
get your hand off me
come on friend
i can smell it on you
get yourself a cup of coffee
youll forget what youre angry about
go fuck yourself
eyes go hard youre a real tough guy when the ladies are around arent you ace
i dont see any ladies here
except maybe you
that does it
earl takes hold of jacks collar and starts to wrestle him roughly toward the door
hey leave him alone
do your brother a favor and have his mouth sewn up
youre a lousy dancer earl
dont you know the mans supposed to lead
earl shoves jack into the hallway hard
jack stumbles back against the wall
who do you think you are asshole
jack walks down the street mindless of the rain
frank follows a few yards behind
we just passed the car
this is a tuxedo
three hundred dollars
pause you gonna talk to me
or is this jacks famous silent act
look it was for publicity
do you understand
jack stops and stares at frank incredulously
what are you
a fucking moron
its three oclock in the morning frank
maybe you can get us a gig playing little franks birthday party
what do you think
i didnt know when we were going to be on until yesterday
what was i supposed to do
i had the pianos anyway
you had us playing for basketballs
i shouldve checked it out
i screwed up
but that doesnt mean you walk out in the middle of a gig
it wasnt professional jack
it was a stunt
a stupid ass stunt
jack just stares at frank as if looking at a stranger
whats happening to you frank
you been kissing ass so long youre starting to like it
you let that guy turn us into clowns tonight
we were always small time but we were never clowns frank
whats happened to your dignity
who the hell are you to talk about dignity
frank suddenly steps forward and reaches into jacks jacket coming away with a bottle
continuing this where you get your dignity jack
this is where you get your courage
jack tries to grab the bottle but frank holds it away
continuing no lets do it straight for once shall we
frank tosses the bottle into the street where it continuing let me explain something to you little brother
see ive got people who depend on me
ive got a wife and two children who expect to wake up every morning with food on the table and heat in the house
i got a mortgage
i got car payments
i got mas medical bills
oh yeah and i got you
jack the shadow whos so cool and so hip and so fucking sure hes better than everyone else
dont you think id like to walk up to one of these assholes and blow smoke in his face
goddamn right i would
but i cant
because i have to be responsible little brother
i have to make sure the numbers balance out in my favor at the end of each month so everyone can go on living their lives
you dont win medals for it but you can be damn sure youd all take notice if i folded up shop
so dont talk to me about dignity little brother
youre drawing on a weak hand
jack stares at frank through the rain then turns and begins to walk away
youre good at that jack
just dont forget to stop off for another bottle of courage on your way home
pause thats what hed do
jack stops his back to frank
continuing youve found the perfect solution to all the pain in the world havent you little brother
eight fifty a bottle available any time day or night at your friendly neighborhood liquor store
youre weak jack
just like he was
jack turns tough and dangerous in the darkness
stay off it
no lets stay on it
im sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god
for christ sake jack he died doing a stupid bullshit jig
he left a wife and two sons
he wasnt a hero
he was a fool
eerily cold you werent there
i wasnt there
i dont have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy
coiled fuck you
no fuck you
and fuck him too
fuck the both of you
jack suddenly bolts for ward and grabs frank by the lapels
continuing hey whatre you doing
jack flings frank against the wall pounding pulling and slamming him in a fitful rage
continuing scared jack
frank slides to the ground afraid trying to protect himself
jack hovers over him
hows it feel to have your little brother beat the shit out of you
jack comes down with a vicious fist at franks face
frank holds up his hands trying to shield himself and catches a blow on his fingers
jack grabs one of franks hands
mocking your hands
your hands couldnt take the blue ribbon on amateur night
jack bends back franks fingers
whos weak now big brother
jack pushes franks fingers until the knuckles crack
franks voice echoes high above the sound of the rain
suddenly jack stops
looking at franks hand still clasped in his he seems as shocked by his own behavior as frank
letting go he steps back awkwardly and looks at his brother beaten to the ground his tuxedo ripped and dirty
he stares at his own hands the knuckles split and bleeding
he no longer looks dangerous
he looks hollow frightened
im through with it
i cant do it anymore
frank rubbing his fingers glances up at jack but jack just turns away leaving frank on the sidewalk and disappears into the rain
a sad plaintive solo piano
and we see jack crossing the street to his apartment the rain over now
frank driving home his face swollen and bruised in the dim glow of the streetlights
jack letting himself into his apartment and standing there
frank easing the car into the driveway turning off the engine
jack taking a bottle from the kitchen moving numbly
frank much later still sitting in the driveway as the sun begins to come up
jack sitting in the phone booth the bottle in his hand
the next morning
jack is sitting on the windowsill watching the rain drum the glass
he glances at the phone across the room takes another look at the rain then goes to the phone
he picks it up hesitantly then dials
someones on the phone and they wont talk
jack sets the phone back down on the cradle
jack stands in a dark bar
it is early morning and the light from the street gives the room a ghostly atmosphere
a big beefy man with a bar towel hooked in his belt is talking to jack
if they wanna talk about their wife you listen
if they wanna talk about their job you listen
if they wanna talk about their parakeet you listen
thats it six nights a week nine to one or until i send you home
jack nods and points to the piano in the corner
how many you need
jack walks over to the giano and strikes a note
its out of tune
trust me the way i fix a martini itll be in tune
the music returns sad and plaintive and we see frank attempting to give piano lessons to a brother and sister tandem who would be better served by an obedience school
while the little girl pounds incessantly on the piano her brother runs circles around the room destroying everything in sight
music continues and we see jack and eddie going for a walk passing the diner where jack and franks pictures are still displayed
music continues and we see jack in the bar playing the music weve been hearing throughout the previous scenes
it is after midnight and the tables are empty
only a few somber men remain at the bar
they do not appear to be music lovers
as jack finishes he takes a cloth and wipes the keys
there is a glass on the piano with money in it
i thought the bakers didnt take tips
jack glances up but he knows the voice
i give it all to charity
saw the sign outside
got your own sign huh
got my own sign
we outgrew each other
yeah well like i said it didnt figure
you dont pick your brother
so hows the cat food business
im doing vegetables next week
none of the important ones
susie tries a smile
takes a breath
you want to get a drink
i got a new place
or we could go to a bar
looking around well maybe not a bar
but i know a place uptown if you want ive given it up
i guess you cant do a reunion over tomato juice can you
pause anyway if youre ever in the neighborhood
i wrote it down
susie takes a slip of paper from her purse and hands it to jack
they lock eyes for a moment
continuing tell egghead i said hi
if you see him
if i see him
susie nods and walks toward the door
as she stops you got pretty eyes
as she leaves jack studies the slip of paper in his hand then drops it in the tip glass
he glances at the door swinging slowly shut in susies wake then reaches into his coat and takes out a bottle
frank sits alone in the darkness of the den
the cardboard stand up is there along with several old photographs including one showing two skinny kids in tuxes standing with a glamorous peggy lee
after a moment donna enters
its late honey
frank stays staring at the photograph of peggy lee
lerner called after dinner
robbie cant make his lesson tomorrow
donna waits for her husband to say something then sees the photograph in his hand
you know how good he is
its like breathing with him
ive always envied it
but tonight looking at all this at his face i dont know
maybe its worse
gesturing to the piano its funny
when i sit here and play
but when i was up there with him
it was like i had the gift too
frank is standing in the hallway of his house leaning against the bathroom door
come on jeremy
open the door
somewhere in the house the phone rings
frank ignores it
you want me to call your father
hes not going to be very happy when he hears hes spending fifteen dollars an hour for you to sit on the toilet
donna looking shaken steps into the hallway
you believe this
the kid wont come out
im playing camptown races for him and the next thing i know hes locked himself in the bathroom
theres nothing sharp in there is there
where are our kids
has he got one of them in there
frank finally looks at his wife
jack rushes down a hospital corridor and heads for the nurses station
as he moves to the counter donna appears
where is she
donna just shakes her head
we tried the apartment but after that we didnt know where to call
jack looks frozen
continuing frankll be back in a moment
he took little frank to the bathroom
jack begins to back away slowly
jack moves aimlessly down the street slipping in and out of shadows
finally he stops inside a closed storefront his back up against the window and looks down at his hands
jack stands in an apartment hallway waiting
after a moment the door opens
well this is some surprise
seeing his face hey
you dont look so good pal
susie studies jack as he glances around the hallway
jack looks up
continuing you want to come in
susie steps back and jack enters
continuing let me get the light
he stares directly into her eyes
continuing leave it dark
jack is standing at the foot of the bed looking down at susies naked back as she sleeps
he studies her face as if looking for something then takes his coat and begins to leave
i used to do that
susie is looking at him
continuing sneak out in the morning
before the guy could wake up and ruin it
never figured id be on the other end of it though
i didnt want to wake you
smiling slightly yeah
for letting me in last night
funny how life repeats itself huh
over and over
like a song
jack looks at susie for a long moment then nods and turns for the door
jack stops his hand on the doorknob
continuing am i gonna see you again
jack looks at her face beautiful in the morning light
youre gonna see me again
susie smiles slightly
jack is standing across the street from his mothers house just looking
after a moment he crosses the street
as he moves up the drive he takes notice of the tree growing in the front yard and crosses to it kneeling by the trunk and studying the scars there
cats claws running vertically up the tree the damage smoothed and widened by time
he runs his fingers over the imperfection then stands and walks toward the house
through the screen door jack can hear a clicking sound and see partially into the front door
half the room is cast in shadow the other in blinding light
he opens the door and enters
inside the movie projector is running the tail of a completed flip slapping like a whip against the carriage
jack turns off the projector and the room falls entirely into shadow
for a moment the house is silent full of ghosts then gradually a noise is heard coming from the kitchen
as jack comes into the kitchen he finds frank searching through a cabinet
he watches for a moment
whatre you looking for
frank turns quickly surprised
i didnt hear you come in
whatre you doing
i was just hoping for something to drink
but it seems the old lady was dry
not even a bottle of cooking sherry
frank looks nervous
continuing uh we already boxed some things
i figured youd want to go through dads stuff
its in there
if you want to get started
continuing is everything done
the arrangements i mean
it was all worked out before you know
she and dad had taken care of it
i set it for wednesday
theyre doing the stone today
pause its okay
theres not going to be a viewing
i figured with the kids and all
jack glances around the room
pictures on the walls
handmade curtains lightly faded
before whenever i came here the house seemed small
i cant keep up with it
i keep losing my wind
frank smiles slightly and he and jack lock eyes for a moment
continuing glancing away god i could use a drink
jack hesitates then pulls a bottle out of his coat
ill get a couple glasses
frank moves to a cabinet but theres nothing there
donna mustve packed them up this morning
jack holds out the bottle
showing the seal is unbroken bought it on the way over
clean as a nun
no its not that
cant drink from the bottle
oh yeah right
frank looks embarrassed
remembering oh hey i want to show you something
jack follows frank back into the front room
frank stands before one of the tiny matching pianos and gestures jack to the other
continuing hit the c
jack steps over to the other piano and taps then frank does the same
jack glances up in surprise
continuing im right arent i
theyre in tune
jack hits the note again and nods in amazement
continuing all these years
she kept them in tune
can you imagine
now why would she do something like that
frank looks down at the keys and his smile fades
suddenly he notices the collection of tiny souvenir shot glasses on top of the piano each bearing the name of a different hotel
continuing hey what do you know
looks like we can have that drink after all
picking up a few glasses whats your pleasure
we got the downtown ramada
we got the travelodge on route
ill take the mallory
frank blows some dust off the glasses
continuing looks like these got a few years on them
thisll kill em
jack pours and he and frank settle on the tiny piano benches
as frank swallows he winces
it suddenly grows silent each sitting in his old familiar place staring into his glass
howre your hands
it was nothing
couple sore knuckles
you know that night i
it just all came up
yeah i know
i mean you can play
smiling i can keep the beat
jack smiles slightly then both go back to their glasses
continuing charlie called
donna said even lloyd called the other day
nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder huh
jack and frank lock eyes again
franks glance drops to jacks glass
jesus when was the last time we played the mallory
five years ago
it was someones birthday
christ thats right
how could i forget
what a nightmare
she asked for it
i told halloran we didnt do vocals but he said in unison what my sissy wants my sissy gets
she got it all right
jack and frank glance at one another little boy mischief glowing in their faces
suddenly they swivel on the pianos and begin to play youre sixteen
singing she comes on like a dream peaches and cream lips like strawberry wine shes sixteen shes beautiful and shes mine
ribbons and curls ooh what a girl eyes that sparkle and shine youre sixteen youre beautiful and youre mine
as jack and frank finish theyre laughing
after a moment their voices die and the house is quiet again
full of ghosts
each stares at the tiny keyboard before him awkward with the intimacy of the moment
it is quiet for a very long time
finally frank looks over
one more time
jack glances up and sees frank has his empty glass held out
he hesitates then picks up the bottle
one more time
