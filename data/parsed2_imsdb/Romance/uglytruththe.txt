screenplay revisions by nicole eastman tracey jackson peter hume david diamond david weissman roger kumble current revisions by karen mccullah lutz kirsten smith february abby richter s pretty driven and
absolutely in control walks through the lobby greeting the security guard
another peaceful day
if you say so
joy s the associate producer falls in step with abby
panicked weve got problems
there are no problems joy
the sky cam on the traffic copter has a cracked lens and they cant fix it
okay thats a problem
call matt hardwick down at media services
hes got a few sky cams and he owes me
now where are my weathermen
joy opens a door to a waiting area
several portly latino men look up and wave at abby
abby waves back and closes the door
the ugly truth numbered script whats with the pot bellies
research shows people like fat weathermen
it makes them feel safe
i like the one in the green and the one in the brown but i want to see the one in the green with less sideburns and the one in
the brown with more then ill make my decision
larry s the pompous uptight anchor man catches up to them
he wears a makeup bib
im sorry to do this to you abby but i dont think i can work with her anymore
its bad enough i have to take her criticism at home
i cant do it on air too
a man can only take so much
abby nods taking him seriously but you can tell shes done this before
youre not a man larry
off his look youre a newsman
a newsman isnt defined by the easy times larry hes defined by the difficult ones
can you imagine ted koppel or chris hansen or anderson cooper having their wives as co anchor
hell no because they couldnt handle it
but you can
youve got balls the size of volkswagens
dont think i havent noticed
the ugly truth numbered script re his balls ive only thought of them as blue as of late but youre right
they are quite sizeable
but not disproportionately so
with pride i like to think of them as aesthetically pleasing abby steps away not wanting to ponder larrys balls anymore than she has to
i think ive made my point
larry nods appeased as she reaches the door marked abby richter producer albuquerque a
she enters and
walks in on a shouting match between josh a leftist angry news writer and dori the entertainment leaning co writer
josh nobody in sacramento gives a crap about trees in alaska
its not newsworthy
oh but full coverage on david beckhams new tattoo is vital
larrys wife and co anchor georgia and coiffed to the gills storms in followed by the shows guest chef
hes trying to kill me
he knows i cant eat crab im allergic to it
to the room does anyone see this
is this a hive
it looks like syphilis to me
to josh see that
you wouldnt even know what syphilis looks like if it werent for my story on paris hilton
the ugly truth numbered script to abby she doesnt eat crab or beef or fish
she doesnt eat anything but chicken
you dont need a chef on this show
you need a box of mcnuggets
everyone shouts at each other
abby calmly pulls out a whistle puts it to her mouth and blows
cameras roll as the chef happily cooks away on the set
georgia and larry taste samples of what hes prepared
i have to tell you bruce
this is the best chicken kiev ive ever tasted
actually its duck kiev
duck makes an excellent alternative for chicken georgia
javier the new fat weatherman takes a huge bite
can i take home the leftovers
they all laugh
when we return our live skycam traffic update and more on david beckhams hundred thousand dollar tattoo
and what you can do to help preserve the ancient forests of alaska and how it might help your albuquerque electric bill
abby and joy stand next to cliff the shows director
go to commercial
to abby i dont know how you do it
the ugly truth numbered script its just a matter of staring the chaos in the eye and showing it whos boss
nice work guys
she pats him on the back and heads out of the control room
to abby stuart wants to see you
hes freaking out
worried that means he got the numbers
abby talks to stuart wardlow s kphxs curmudgeonly general manager
have you seen the ratings for yesterday
we got beat by all the network shows plus a rerun of whos the boss
the one where the vacuum breaks
its a temporary setback
this week well do better
the guy with the cable access show on channel does better
if we programed jerry springer re runs wed do a nine share at a quarter the price
abby looks worried
please tell me youre not thinking of killing the show
im not but i can guarantee you thats what the new managements thinking
stuart sacramento am is an award winning news program
the ugly truth numbered script management doesnt listen to awards
it listens to numbers
were not a family run station anymore abby
youre good at what you do but youve got to get me some numbers
ive got two daughters in college and a son in beauty school
i dont know how much you know about vidal sassoon but that shit aint cheap
you can count on me stuart
abby and joy stand at the sinks
abby compulsively flosses in front of the mirror
i cant be letting corporate management dictate the content of this show
this is my show
i control it
she rips out an extra two feet of floss
abby contd i should cancel my date tonight and make a list of ideas for sweeps
you should be out observing humanity
humanitys who watches our show
youve already rescheduled on this guy three times
you cancel tonight and hes gone
hes read more than a dozen books he has a k and hes cute
she holds up her clipboard which has the guys e harmony profile and photo
the ugly truth numbered script joy contd contd look at this bone structure
this could be the bone structure of your future children
dont you want them to be symmetrical
abby stops flossing and looks at joy
you printed his profile
i live vicariously through your dating life
and i really think that this could be our next boyfriend
cmon he had nine out of ten items on your checklist
well technically eight and a half
he said he could cook but when i pressed him he was completely unfamiliar with cumin
dont you think thats a little suspicious
off joys look we cut to
sacramentos nicest restaurant
diners enter and exit
abby approaches the female hostess at her podium
im looking for a guy with sandy brown hair athletic build and blue eyes
hes which i know what youre thinking its a little short but hes read the great gatsby twice so well just live with it okay
technically im and
she turns mortified to see jim s and good looking
actually hes better looking in person than in his photo
the ugly truth numbered script jim contd but ill read gatsby again if that makes it any better
shall i show you to your table
abby and a mildly perturbed jim follow clearly not off to a banner start
abby and jim sit at a table
abby looks around tense
you know what
this is not the best angle
we should get the table over there
then we both get a view instead of one of us looking at the busboy station
im fine here
no trust me
itll be better over there
he looks at her like shes crazy as they get up and move
the waiter is now taking their drink order
can i get you some water for the table
bottle of flat please
you know theyve done studies that show tap water is no different from bottled water
and they passed a law recently to have all restaurants filter their tap water
so technically its not tap water
the ugly truth numbered script abby contd its filtered water which is exactly what bottled water is except you dont have to pay for it
yeah i still like the way it tastes better
can i get you any cocktails
scotch on the rocks
in your profile you said you liked red wine
i do i just feel like having a scotch right now
she looks disappointed then pulls out a piece of paper
re the paper was there anything else you changed your mind about
i mean just so i can figure it into the overall picture
you printed out my profile
actually my associate producer did
she likes me to be prepared
not that im ever not prepared
kudos on your comprehensive car insurance policy by the way
that wasnt in my profile
no but it was in your background check
off his look changing the subject so
tell me about yourself
the ugly truth numbered script well whats left that you dont know
theres an awkward silence between them
she pulls out another piece of paper and hands it to him
i printed out some talking points for us just in case this happened
i take it its happened before
no but since you have nine out of ten of the necessary attributes on my checklist i just wanted to make sure this goes as smoothly as possible
as jim processes this the waiter arrives with drinks
he takes a huge sip relieved
abby looks at him
you realize the ice in that scotch is made from tap water dont you
he looks at her realizing shes a complete nightmare
jim and abby walk to their cars
jim is walking faster than she is trying to get away
she trots along trying to keep up
next time we could go bowling
i noticed online that youre the mid ranked amateur in the state
i mean if there is a next time
im not trying to be presumptuous but i am getting a pretty good vibe here
the ugly truth numbered script jim doesnt even consider refuting this
he just wants to leave
abby reaches into her purse and pulls out floss
uh no thanks
i should go
he gets into his car as she hands him his doggy bag
fyi be sure to eat this by tomorrow
with curry you cant smell if its gone bad so after three days you should just toss it
really dont even give it to a pet or anything
abby has officially lost control to the producer part of herself
she knows what shes doing but cant stop herself
here just to be sure ill write todays date on it for you
abby takes a pen out and writes a date on the bag
annoyed its fine really
the bottom of the bag gives out and a container of goopy leftovers spills all over jims lap
horrified i told them to double bag this
im just gonna go
im so sor jim closes the door catching the hem of abbys wrap skirt
abby contd contd wait my
the ugly truth numbered script the car speeds off ripping abbys skirt right off her as it races away
abby is left standing in her underwear
abby still in her undies trudges up the steps
she opens her front door
her calico cat dartagnan skeptical and easily annoyed stares up at her
abby now in pajamas flosses her teeth
she hears a noise coming from her bedroom and looks to see dartagnans paw in the fish bowl trying to scoop up a goldfish
abby picks up the cat
how many times do i have to tell you
leave juliet alone
wasnt romeo enough for you
abby picks up the remote snaps the tv on to nightline with brian williams
now theres a man
not some five foot nine scotch drinker who lies about cumin
she heads into the bathroom
as abby flosses in front of the mirror
dartagnan hisses at the tv and steps on the remote control
on tv the channel jumps to a cable access show
mike alexander s handsome but not pretty proudly dressed in an outfit that costs less than fifty dollars addresses the camera
the ugly truth numbered script you want the truth
but you cant handle the truth
cause its ugly
the theme song for the ugly truth kicks in over a series of past scenes mike judo kicking an giant oprah doll
several posters spelling the word love are destroyed by mike with a variety of weapons
the theme sequence ends and cuts to the ugly truth live on air
the look of the shows set is low rent cable tv
im mike alexander and were back with the the ugly truth
tonight as always were going to talk about what it is men and women really want in relationships
ive been looking through some books
he holds up several books in his hands reading the titles
smart women foolish choices women who love men who hate them hating men who love women but hate loving men
he drops the books on the floor picks up a can of gasoline and pours it on the books
billions and billions of dollars wasted on self help psychobabble
mike lights a match and tosses it on the books setting them ablaze
then opens up his jacket and takes out a stick with a marshmallow
begins roasting the marshmallow on the flame
now listen up ladies cause im only gonna say this once tonight and its just three little words
no theyre not i love you
we can not be trained
all this men are from venus bullshit is a waste of your time and money
the ugly truth numbered script you want to be a lonely hag then keep reading these stupid books
you want a relationship heres how you get one its called a stairmaster
get on it and get skinny and get some trashy lingerie because at the end of the day all were interested in is looks
no one falls in love with your personality at first sight they fall in love with your tits and your ass
and they stick around because of what youre willing to do with them
you want to win a man over
you dont need ten steps
you need one
and its called a blow job
mike shoves a burnt marshmallow into his mouth
and dont forget to he mimes swallowing
we pan off the television to the bed where abby now watches appalled
oh my god
its that cable access jackass stuart was talking about
mike takes a call
how dare you burn those books
theyve helped my personal life more than whats your boyfriends name princess
im not seeing anyone right now but mike hangs up the phone
the ugly truth numbered script my point exactly shrek
abby now infuriated picks up the phone and begins dialing
we intercut between the stage and her apartment as mike continues his rant
men dont fall in love
men fall in want
we want things
were hunters and gatherers
were the same as we were when we were cavemen and a gillion years of evolution hasnt done squat
trust me there was a pamela anderson of cave women and all the cave guys were trying to stick their dicks in her
mike walks over to a chalk board with the word love on it
he crosses it out and writes lust
mike contd contd now girls if you want to think lust is the same as love thats fine but youre delusional
lets take some more calls
picks up the phone youre on the air
abby is now on the phone
so youre saying men are incapable of love
did i burst your little harlequin romance bubble
irritated abby begins to compulsively remake her bed
the only thing you burst is your credibility
men are absolutely capable of experiencing love
okay ill bite
whos the guy
the ugly truth numbered script what
the guy mr
wonderful the one whos so capable of love
who is he
whats he like
well hes not like you thats for sure
thank you very much
hes handsome but doesnt know it
enjoying the fantasy hes successful but in a job that means something
he loves red wine classical music cary grant movies
this is a guy in america right
youre not calling from europe or anything
are you interested in listening or not
im loving this
he works out not because hes vain because its healthy
hes socially liberal but fiscally conservative
he likes dogs but hes a cat person
he never gets out of bed before you on a sunday morning oh my god
youre a lesbian
well youre describing a woman
the ugly truth numbered script why are those qualities so threatening to you
perhaps because your complete lack of any one of them is the real reason why women arent interested in you
at least women of quality
mike scoffs but hes thrown
he takes a moment then
where is this guy
i will give you one hundred dollars of my own money to bring him down here and let me meet him
oh hes out there
wait a second
youre not even dating this guy
im just describing a type
i thought thats what we were doing
you dont even know him
mike bowls over laughing
abby realizes shes been had
now i get the whole picture
youre a dog
she rips the perfectly made bed apart and starts over
you heard me
you must be
if you were hot youd be out breaking some poor schmucks heart instead of spending all your time fantasizing about mr
face it youre ugly
i am not ugly
the ugly truth numbered script well of course you dont think so
ugly people never know theyre ugly
its like people who have b
they never know it because theyre surrounded by their own stench all the time
now abbys really fuming
she snaps a sheet violently
that is the most ridic look lemme help you out here
you might as well just face the fact that youre gonna be alone and stop pining away for some fantasy guy youre never going to get
get a hobby
build housing for the poor
how could you possibly hey lassie the shows called the ugly truth
if you cant face it dont call
switching gears well that about wraps it up for today
im mike alexander reminding you that the truth is never pretty
as he smiles smugly abby screams and throws the phone across the room
dartagnan terrified jumps off the bed which is now in total disarray
abby and joy make their way into the conference room
dori and josh are already there
how did the date go
i ended up pantsless in a parking lot
the ugly truth numbered script stuart walks into the conference room
he puts a dvd in the player
now before i play this i have to warn you
hits play hes a little rough around the edges
on tv mikes face appears
face it youre ugly
i am not ugly
joy looks at abby
is that you
ugly people never know theyre ugly
its like people who have abby grabs the remote and turns off the t
why are we watching this
say hello to our new guest commentator
im starting him with two segments a week
three minutes a pop
are you kidding me
who the hell is this guy
the ugly truth numbered script his name is mike alexander
and hes a quintessential misogynist uber moron who represents everything wrong with television and society at large
i get crap every time i suggest we do something even remotely fluffy and now youre gonna put this douchebag on the air
hes got a point of view
we dont have to like him were news people
stone phillips interviews terrorists doesnt mean he likes them
its good for ratings
abby holds up a piece of paper
ive got a whole list of ideas on how to improve ratings
we dont need him
stuart takes the memo reading it
a live debate on immigration policy
what are you talking about
albuquerque is latino
at this moment mike walks in
abby stares at him appalled
yeah and as you can tell by all the screaming rugrats in this town latino guys like to have a lot of sex
which means theyd rather listen to me tell them how to bang hot chicks than hear about why they cant bring grandma across the border
as they all stare at him
the ugly truth numbered script mike contd sorry i was eavesdropping out in the hall
see what did i tell you
abby spins to face stuart
you already hired him
re abby whos this delightful creature
i like a woman on top
abby is pacing clearly on the verge of hysteria
chanting i am an award winning news producer
i am an award winning news producer
then the door opens and mike appears
hey no hard feelings right
you dont even knock
i got no response
so essentially your knock was negated by your complete lack of adherence to the social etiquette of what follows a knock
the ugly truth numbered script wow
you are wound like a fuckin top
abby glares at him
recognize the bark
he stares at her surprised
then realizing hey what do you know
youre not ugly at all
imagine my relief
you know if it werent for you i would have never gotten this gig
you and i make good tv
im sorry what channel is your show on
this is channel two
you do know that the lower numbers are better right
more people watch
so dont tell me that you and i make good tv
i am an award winning news producer
i make good tv
you make imbecilic trash watched by housebound inbreds who are so busy putting their hands down their pants theyre unable to change the channel
i hadnt really been picturing you that way but thanks for the image
let me tell you something
i am not one of your viewers
my cat stepped on the remote
the ugly truth numbered script thank your pussy for me then
abby gags as she pushes past him and walks out
abby strides down the hall with georgia and larry
there is no way mike alexander is going to stay on my show
i want you to skewer him
make him look like a complete idiot
not that it will be hard
the man is a moron of unseen proportions
re larry thats just what we need on this show
does anyone think my highlights are too shiny
larry listen to me
i want mike alexander to go down in flames
i want mike alexander to be nothing but a pile of ash on the seat next to you
i want the janitor to come in with his dustbuster and vacuum up the ashes of mike alexander and then when he throws the ashes into the dumpster outside i
want the rats to vomit and then defecate on the ashes of mike alexander
she strides off
larry looks at georgia
and i thought you were angry and bitter
uh no that would be my untouched vagina
cameras roll as larry and georgia sit at the anchor desk
the ugly truth numbered script for years there have been concerns about lowering television standards
but many believe that this man and his local public access show the ugly truth have brought things to a new low
with that we welcome mike alexander
mike gives a cocky wave
how ya doing guys
mike how do you respond to those who say your show is offensive
but then again so is the truth
the truth about what mr
what relationships are really like
abby and the control room crew watch the proceedings
cliff mans the bank of monitors
take marriage for instance
its about mutual benefits social pressure and taxes
its not about love and we should stop pretending it is
we intercut with georgia larry and mike on set
cmon georgia let him have it
sounds to me like no ones ever loved you and youre taking it out on the female population
in the control room abby smirks
the ugly truth numbered script ooh good one
well while were making observations you two project this image of the perfect couple when clearly its a lie
abby nervously gnaws on the straw from her kombucha drink
nervous cliff lets go to commercial
stuart told me to keep rolling no matter what
abby is pissed
this is my show
not right now it isnt
on the set mike continues his vivisection of larry and georgia
i mean come on larry i grew up watching you on tv
you used to be this cool confident cat
georgias no dumb bunny
she knew the only way she was getting off the weekend shift was by hooking up with you
but then lo and behold she became more popular than you and ended up with twice your salary
take him down
she starts twisting her straw into shapes as
the ugly truth numbered script im proud of my wifes success
bullllloney you are
you hate her success
you feel emasculated by her and that screws with your head which inevitably screws with your manhood
whats your point mr
good girl georgia
my point is that your husband hasnt had sex with you in
im gonna say
thats not my fault
i know its her fault
why is it my fault
in the control room abby looks like shes going to pass out
oh dear god
well what am i supposed to do give up the money so he can get an erection
youve economically emasculated your husband to such a point that hes afraid to desire you
sure you can dump his ass but honey have you seen the eligible men in albuquerque
its slim pickings out there for a woman in her forties
youre not going to do any better than larry
you just have to let him be a man
the ugly truth numbered script mike contd to larry and you frowny mcflacid give it to her
larry grabs georgia and kisses her hard
after a moment of resistance she melts into his arms
the crew goes crazy
larry throws georgia over his back and hauls her off the set
abby sinks down into a chair
and were out
he cuts to black
its pitch black
suddenly a closet door is opened
joy and stuart stand in the doorway
abby is sitting in a ball in her closet
one thousand one hundred and forty seven calls and over three hundred e mails
and fifty three percent of them were women
this guys a lightening rod
confused people liked him
they loved him
how is that possible
i dont know but im scaling back the news and giving it to the ugly truth
corporate wants five minutes of mike alexander five days a week
stuart i really think this is a mistake
the ugly truth numbered script just keep him happy and both of our contracts will be renewed
joy turns back to abby
abby closes the closet door on herself
mike enters his apartment throws his keys on the counter and hits play on his answering machine
hey mike its valerie
i havent heard from you in a while
but i just saw you on tv
you were great
he pushes skip
mike hi its ginevra im having a party skip
why havent you called me
i miss you
its laura by the way
we went to the track
how could i forget
you threw up in my car
jonah awkward mikes nephew walks in
dude you totally hosed me
last week on your show you said you should always be mean to hot girls because theyll want you more
i tried it today she cried and then i got detention
the ugly truth numbered script first of all dont listen to what i say on my show
second of all youre supposed to do that to year old girls who think theyre hot and can get any guy they want
not year old girls
theyre going through puberty
they have enough problems
mom said when she was fourteen she was the prettiest girl in the class
well i was there when she was fourteen and let me tell you something she lied
mikes sister elizabeth s walks in wearing a nurses uniform and holding a cake box
dont listen to your uncle mike he was blind from masturbating too much
oh thats a nice thing to tell your son its nothing worse than what hes heard on your show
she hands him the cake box
lets hope you can clean it up now that youre on a network
she gives him a kiss on the cheek
he opens the box
reading the cake happy th birthday harold
the ugly truth numbered script sorry i didnt have time to bake one
i took it from work
harold didnt quite make it through the big day
re the cake looks like he got to blow out his candles
re the candles what do you think did him in
he closes the box
who wants to go out and eat
abby and joy lie in lawn chairs drinking margaritas as joys husband ken barbecues shrimp kebobs nearby
tipsy im just going to keep drinking until my mind blots out any memory of mike alexander
i dont know if i have that much tequila
maybe i should eat the worm
ken looks over
is mike alexander the guy you went on the date with
no that was a different source of humiliation but thank you for reminding me
i still dont understand why you didnt just marry bill
he was a good guy
the ugly truth numbered script yeah
but he also had navy blue sheets and bath towels with tassels
he played computer games on his phone
he wore open toed shoes
sometimes with socks
and his mother called him bucky
plus he sucked in bed
yes there was that then wait why are we sharing this with ken
i tell him everything
to abby by the way i thought it was hilarious when you asked that one guy for a toxicology report
he was exposed to asbestos
joy gives her a look
abby sighs realizing the extent of her neuroses
give me the freaking worm
mikes goofing with the pretty makeup girl as abby walks up to give him some last minute tips
keep it clean keep it moving and stick to the script
youre on a live affiliate network news program
you do not have the luxury of using the words blow and job in the same sentence
if you say anything scatological youre fired
the ugly truth numbered script really
because i thought you were gonna get fired if you dont keep me happy
leaning closer ive got a list of demands to go over after the show
and let me just warn you theyre gonna be scatological
she fumes jabbing the earpiece in his ear
just because you look pretty today i wont mention the misguided phallic rage you just displayed
re mikes ear piece if you hear my voice in your ear do what i say
promise youll talk dirty
mike is cut off by cliff in the booth
and camera one
abby slips out of frame just in time
mike looks to the camera
im mike alexander and this is the ugly truth where well be taking a few minutes every day to talk about men women and relationships
lets start with men
men are simple
to illustrate my point on my left we have the best our world has to offer
he crosses to a candle lit table with a fancy dinner placed in the center
several books rest beside it
beside the table a man plays violin
you have a gourmet meal fine wine classical music and great literature
he picks up a copy of ulysses from the table
the ugly truth numbered script now if youll follow me we have something quite different
he starts to walk off the set
now in the control room abby panics
where the hell is he going
mike exits the stage door and walks into the alley followed by the confused camera crew
ah i see you ladies have started without me
he smiles at two blonde twins in bikinis who wrestle in a kiddie pool of jello
we intercut with the control room
who let them on the lot
dont we have security
in the alley a security guard watches the girls smitten
mike smiles to the camera
babes wrestling in jello
lets just take a quick survey and see which option the men out there would pick
do we have phone lines
beethoven stuffed pheasant and james joyce or semi naked chicks frolicking in strawberry flavored goo
the ugly truth numbered script as abby looks horrified the phones in the control room start ringing off the hook
realizing her defeat abby sighs
jesus if were gonna do this we might as well milk it
then into headset two go wide
ready one tight on his hand
abby grabs the microphone for mikes ear piece
lick the jello off her finger
on the monitor a slightly puzzled look from mike but he lifts the girls finger and licks the jello off it
into headset go one
the camera focuses tightly on his face
i was wrong
and thats the ugly truth
over to you georgia
as mike waves to camera hes pulled into the jello pool and the girls rip off his shirt
mike walks in covered in jello to find abby standing there arms crossed quietly containing her rage
your realize i once had the archbishop desmond tutu on this show
abby rubs her temples
i cant even illustrate how far ive fallen because youre not smart enough to get the references
she walks off
confused by her reaction he follows
the ugly truth numbered script cmon we were a good team back there
you were the one who told me to lick the jello
do you have any idea how much i hate myself for that
it was cheap titillation
i am now going to broadcasting hell right behind geraldo and the naked weather girl from canada
theres a naked weather girl
can we get her
close on stuart wearing a grave expression
into camera youve got to do it for ratings abby
we have no choice
abby nods uncomfortable
we pull back to reveal that shes now the naked weather girl sitting behind the anchor desk
strategically placed cardboard suns and clouds cover her bosom
traumatized she reads off the teleprompter
today it will be partly sunny
with a cloud cover moving in from my left breast
seated next to her brian williams shakes his head disappointed
theres a crash and we cut to on the sofa abby bolts awake from her nightmare seeing juliets fish bowl lying in shattered pieces on the floor
the ugly truth numbered script she leaps up then sees the cat licking his chops
dartagnan bolts out the front door
abby runs through the grounds of the complex looking or d artagnan
here kitty kitty
she spots him hiding under a u haul and slowly creeps towards him
its okay baby
im not mad
i mean yes i am somewhat angry but im repressing it
a car speeds past honking obnoxiously at abby
the cat races away then climbs up a large tree beside one of the condos
abby sighs and follows
this is how i get to spend my evening
abby looks up the tree to see dartagnan perched on a branch above
its okay baby
just stay there
abby jumps up grabs a branch and starts to climb
abby starts climbing higher testing branches as she goes
finally she reaches the branch hes on
youre gonna be okay
the ugly truth numbered script abby grabs a branch overhead and scoots down the limb
she reaches out picks up the cat and cradles him
ive got you
dartagnan safely in hand she looks around and notices shes just outside a window
she looks in and sees a handsome man in a steamy bathroom taking a shower
this is oh my
abby covers the cats eyes then looks away
but a moment later shes looking back in the window to see colin step out of the shower
abby takes a deep breath as he crosses to the mirror giving her a look at his abs
oh my my
abby leans closer to see colin start flossing wearing only a towel
a delighted gasp he flosses
suddenly we hear a crack and the branch breaks
colin looks out the window and makes eye contact with abby just as ahhhh
dartagnan leaps to another branch as abby falls
as she plummets her foot gets caught between some branches leaving her now hanging upside down
the front lights switch on and colin still in a towel races out of his condo
as he runs up to the tree just stay calm
youre gonna be fine
the branch breaks
the ugly truth numbered script ahhh
abby falls to the ground but colin catches her
but only for a moment
she drops out of his arms and onto the ground
as she goes his towel goes with her
landing on her face
she pulls the towel away and looks up trying not to make eye contact with the one eyed trouser snake staring back at her
hi im abby
mike plays poker with his buddies dwayne s chubby steve s latino and gary s bespectacled
while mike tries to concentrate on the game but the guys are more interested in reading his fan mail
reading dear mike i know im the girl who can change you and make you fall in love
heres a photo of me and my iguana
steve looks at the photo
i thought iguanas only liked dry places
he passes it to gary
we might need to call animal control on this one
guys enough with the fan mail
you dont want to add her into your rotation
the ugly truth numbered script uh no
what about the tranny
he seemed nice
and he went to all the trouble to knit you that cock sock
mike rolls his eyes and deals the cards
can we just play poker
unpacked boxes are stacked everywhere
classical music plays on the stereo
colin now in sweats and a t shirt examines abbys ankle
impressed youre a doctor
an orthopedic surgeon
she glances around the room and sees a bottle of red wine and a half empty wine glass sitting on a table
i do a lot of leg and hip stuff but i do get the occasional foot
you seem to be fine
well i guess im pretty lucky dartagnan picked your tree to climb
dave in the next unit over sells lawn furniture
i dont know that i would have been as confident with his diagnosis
im here whenever you need me
abby puts on her shoes as colin opens his wallet and hands her a card
the ugly truth numbered script my home numbers on the back
if the ankle starts giving you problems just give me a call
colin picks up the cat who starts purring
wow he doesnt usually like men
dogs are great but
well youre a cat person
abby looks at him nodding
delighted at his complete and utter perfection
well i guess i should get going now
she remains rooted to her spot
he waits a beat then feeling awkward makes a move to open the door
thanks again for saving me
she walks out and colin closes the door
realizing that he still has the cat in his arms he opens the door to find abby doing a spazzy happy dance
startled she quickly composes herself
you forgot your cat
re the dance oh
there was a spider
but its gone now
he chuckles hands her dartagnan
he closes the door
the ugly truth numbered script abby hates herself
im such an idiot she starts doing a self hating spazzy dance mocking her previous dance
just as colin opens the door again you alright
im going now
she walks off trying to maintain her dignity
abby and joy walk down the hall towards the set
you should see him
you have no idea
well how did you leave it
did he ask for your number
no but he gave me his
what do i do
should i call
and if i did what would i say
joy looks a little overwhelmed
they walk onto the set where mike faces the camera finishing up his segment
if you want a woman to keep sleeping with you there are certain things you never say
the ugly truth numbered script mike contd for instance hell no i dont want to meet your family
or how hard is it to lose ten pounds
i have to take a dump ill call you back
and heres one thats sunk a lot of perfectly good sexual relationships marriage
im just hanging out with you until i meet someone better
guys use your big head to help your little head
in other words lie
and thats the ugly truth
as they watch abby turns to joy
you promised me the worm would make him go away
as abby shakes her head in disgust a p
walks up and hands her a sheet of paper
abby and joy study them
i should be happy about this shouldnt i
reading the ratings uh yeah youve never gotten a twelve share before
i feel so dirty
mike approaches them
you hear about the ratings
and did you hear corporates coming next week to take me to dinner
the ugly truth numbered script i hope you can chew with your mouth closed
she turns and walks off
whats up with her
shes spiraling lower and lower into a morass of self loathing and intense hatred for you
yeah i picked up on that
abby walks down the corridor
she turns the corner and comes face to face with mike
why do you hate my guts
your innards are of no consequence to me
i hate what you represent
you hate the truth
your skewed perception of male female interaction is not the truth
but your imaginary boyfriends the truth
for your information i happened to meet him last night
i really hope hes real this time because otherwise this is just sad
oh hes very real
not to mention stunningly handsome and morally sound
his names colin
the ugly truth numbered script abby contd hes a doctor
an orthopedic surgeon actually
you know what that means
he had to stick his finger up some guys butt in medical school
you disgust me
abby enters her office
mike follows her
so did butt boy ask you out
were taking things slow getting to know each other first
then why am i talking about this with you
youre the one who brought it up
anderson is everything that you could never be
abby takes colins card from her wallet dials a number then into phone hi this is abby richter calling for dr
yes ill hold
youre calling the guy
you cant do that
youve gotta let him call you
the ugly truth numbered script please
its the twenty first century
abby shoots mike a snide grin
this is abby
from last night
colin in a white doctors jacket talks on the phone while going over patient files
couldnt be better
i just wanted to call and tell you how much i enjoyed meeting you
mike picks up the extension and listens in
abby glares at him but she cant stop him
i was just thinking that we should have dinner
not great oh
mike shakes his head knowing where this is going
theres this new french bistro that got fantastic reviews and theres a gallery opening in old town on friday
so if you want we could have dinner then go to the opening
the ugly truth numbered script is that not a good time
actually abby im still kind of unsettled with the move and everything so i m really not mike snatches the phone from abby and hangs it up
what the hell are you doing
he was blowing you off
he was not
she moves to pick up the phone
mike sits on the phone to stop her
hell be expecting you to call him back
when you dont hell call you
how do you know
because i know men
if you want it to work out with this guy youll listen to me and do exactly as i say
you already did irreparable damage with your psycho aggressive control freak phone call
it might even be too late
even if you do salvage the situation youll probably never be more than abby his desperate neighbor
im not desperate
then why did i sound desperate
listen to you desperately asking me if you sound desperate
a concerned look from abby as
the phone rings
her caller i
says sacramento med
the ugly truth numbered script although you wont admit it you know i know what im talking about
beat its your call dude
she thinks looks at the phone again
what do i do
pick up the phone and say hey doug
why would i just do it
she answers the phone
a confused look from colin as he talks on the phone
no this is colin
oh my god
whispering just a guy im seeing
its nothing serious
mike shoves her
just a guy im seeing
its nothing serious
the ugly truth numbered script oh
whispering hang on a sec
hang on a sec
mike puts the phone on hold
make him wait
a long pause
this is so rude
thats the point
when do i pick up
you make him wait until he gets frustrated and hangs up
if hes still holding on after thirty more seconds you may actually have a chance
youd better be right about this
think about it
would you wait on hold for somebody you were trying to blow off
you have a point
just give me a little bit of time and i can make this guy your bitch
the ugly truth numbered script scoffing i dont want a bitch
and colin would never be a bitch
hes a well rounded man capable of mature emotions and deep abiding love
things which you know not of
maybe not but i know about lust seduction and manipulation
and clearly you do not
why would you want to help me
because then youll have to admit that i know more about this stuff than you do
they stare each other down
then mike looks at his watch
the phone light is still blinking
my god youre right
mike hangs up the phone
always make an impression
lets get out of here
we have work to do
but what about dont worry in five seconds hell call back
skeptical what are you nostradamus
thats the phone rings again
the ugly truth numbered script in awe amazing
he hustles her out of the room
a moment after the door closes mike rushes back in and hangs up the ringing phone
he smiles then bolts
colin hangs up the phone
abby and mike walk down the street
rule number one
even if its constructive
men are incapable of growth change or progress
for men self improvement ends at toilet training
rule number two
laugh at whatever he says
what if what hes saying isnt funny
a fake laugh is like a fake orgasm
and a fake orgasm is good
no but a fake orgasm is better than no orgasm at all
a fake orgasm is no orgasm
the ugly truth numbered script only to you
youre not the only person in the room you know
lets not be selfish
mike is struck by the sound of her laughter
that was perfect
you have a perfect laugh
real or fake
youll never know
he raises an eyebrow impressed
mike and abby wait for their lattes
rule number three
never talk about your problems
men dont really listen or care
some men care
some men pretend to care
when we ask you how youre doing its just guy code for let me put my dick in your ass
okay im trying to decide whether i should just walk away right now or run
i know you think colin is above it all but hes a guy
if hes even remotely into you hes thought about each one of your orifices at least ten times
i love how you assume every man is as perverse as you are
i dont assume
the ugly truth numbered script mike and abby walk along coffees in hand
rule number four
men are very visual
ninety percent of a relationship is based on how good the woman looks
we have to change your look
whats wrong with my look
taking her in sports bras
these arent nurse shoes
theyre lady keds
abby youre a very attractive woman but you are completely inaccessible
youre all about comfort and efficiency
whats wrong with comfort and efficiency
except no one wants to fuck it
with that a montage begins
mike and abby wander through the racks of lingerie
i am not getting breast implants
size isnt everything
breasts just have to be friendly
they have to say hello everybody
look at me
abby looks down at her breasts curiously
the ugly truth numbered script what are mine saying
uh im reading tolstoy and i dont want to be disturbed
i hate tolstoy
a saleswoman passes them
excuse me maam but we need some bras that will make my friends boobs say put me in your mouth i taste good
the saleswoman looks disturbed but hands him a push up water bra
this should do the trick
to abby strap it on flapjacks
abby glares at him as we cut to abby wearing high heels awkwardly makes her way over to mike
i look like a hooker
thats a good thing
she falls knocking over a large display of shoes
mike contd well youre on your back so that works
abby sits at a rinse chair while mike and the hairdresser study her look
the ugly truth numbered script youre not touching my hair until i know exactly what youre going to do with it
were giving you bedhead
why would i want bedhead
bedhead is sexy
re her current hairdo a ponytail implies that you are either operating heavy machinery or emptying the litter box
neither of these things inspires an erection
the hairdresser shoves her head under the sink and douses her with water
night has fallen on the condo complex
mike avoids the cat while waiting in the living room
i just dont want to be perceived as a bimbo
i dont want you to be a bimbo
you need to be two people the saint and the sinner the librarian and the stripper
its a delicate balance
on one hand you have to push the guy away with cold indifference and yet on the other hand be a sexually teasing tornado
abby enters looking amazing in a little black dress and sling backs
her hair and make up are sexy but not trashy
well just dont sit there
the ugly truth numbered script huh
you need glasses
but i wear contacts
besides doesnt the woman usually remove glasses during a makeover
yeah but were going for a stripperlibrarian thing
right now i wouldnt trust you to find me a book
abby opens a drawer and takes out some glasses
she puts them on
now we need to practice flirting
i know how to flirt
do you want to be an old maid
so if i dont listen to you ill be an old maid
acting old my names abby and im arthritic and alone
i have eighteen cats who keep me company
sarcastic oh ha ha
thats very funny
pretending to be mike are you wearing underwear
she grabs his ass
i wouldnt say that and i wouldnt grab ass
the ugly truth numbered script still as mike hey babe whats wrong with a little ass grabbing
continuing to pinch his ass i mean whats the point of you even having one unless its there for me to grab it
youre just a set of orifices and a pair of tee tas
youre a deeply deeply disturbed person
switching tactics abby slips into seductress mode tracing her finger up and down his arm
maybe im just a good student
would you stop doing that
touching me with your finger
she seductively leans into him
am i turning you on
she gives him a look
actually i kind of like it
she leans in closer
he shoves her away
the ugly truth numbered script no teaching the teacher
just then the doorbell rings
who is it
oh my god
told you hed drop by
panicking im not ready for this
keep the conversation under a minute
keep him guessing
mike leaps over the couch and hides
as abby walks over to the door and opens it
colin stands there
wow you look great
what happened to you today
what do you mean
you put me on hold and didnt call me back
that was you
im so sorry
steering him to the door
the ugly truth numbered script abby contd can you call me later
im super busy
she hustles him out the door
colin bangs on the door
mike pops up from under the couch
he gives her the thumbs up
whispering now what
make him suffer
do you want to go the lobos game on saturday
she looks at mike in amazement then breaks into the happy dance
he watches horrified at her spazziness
what the hell is that
as she continues to dork out we cut to the roar of the crowd at the lobos game
colin walks with abby who adjusts something in her ear
now shes wearing the earpiece from the station and on the other end
mikes pov through binoculars a different angle of abby walking down the aisle
nod if you can hear me
binoculars pov abby nods
the ugly truth numbered script just relax
youre gonna be fine
ill walk you through this
colin looks at abby and smiles as they take their seats popcorn in hand
do you follow baseball
we intercut with mike
theres no right answer to that question
do something non committal
abby does something between a nod and shaking her head
colin hooks at her confused
im really more of a fair weather fan myself
i do like watching mike deloggia pitch though
amazing bone structure
abby is baffled but proceeds to laugh awkwardly
colin looks at her
whats so funny
shit he was serious
feeling a popcorn kernel in her teeth abby takes out her floss
wait what the fuck are you doing
is that floss
the ugly truth numbered script jesus
put that away
she puts the floss back in her purse
now toss your hair
she dramatically tosses her hair from one side to the other
okay that was a little over the top but nice try
abby realizes shes spoken aloud
thank you for
just being you
okay no more improvising
just repeat everything i say youre so much fun to be with
youre so much fun to be with
a fan calls to mike
hey down in front
mike gestures for the fan to leave him alone as he continues to instruct abby
to abby youre not like the other guys i ve dated
the ugly truth numbered script youre not like the other guys ive dated
hey sit down jackass
mike waves him off trying to remain focused on abby
to abby youre so much more interesting and informed
youre so much more interesting and informed
thats nice to hear
the fan throws peanuts at mike
mike turns around and shouts at the fan
dude what the fuck
dude what the fuck
abby blanches waiting for mike instructions
colin is now just staring at her
to abby no im not talking to you
im not talking to you
did i do something wrong
the ugly truth numbered script abby listen tell him you saw him looking at another girl
its the only way out of this
to colin were you looking at another girl
she points to the only nearby female an elderly obese hot dog lady
i was just trying to get us a hot dog
theres an awkward moment as colin hands her the hot dog
alright we need a recovery
make sure to eat your hot dog slowly
men like watching penis shaped food go into a girls mouth
repulsed she flinches losing control of her drink dumping it into colins lap
oh my god im so sorry
she grabs a napkin and starts rubbing his khakis
its fine really
no i have to get it out or else it will stain she puts some muscle into it
the ugly truth numbered script what fabric is this
cottons the worst
well actually leathers the worst followed by suede
unbeknownst to them the batter hits a pop fly near them
the jumbotron camera follows the guy catching the fly then finds abby and colin
pans over to them and it looks like abby is giving colin an enthusiastic hand job
the entire stadium ballplayers included stop what theyre doing and stare
are you sure theyre cotton cause this should be coming out wait
its definitely coming
she smiles at colin
as he looks nervously up at the abby follows his gaze and sees shes on it
everyone at the stadium is looking at her
the organ player bangs out charge
the stadium starts whooping and hollering
abby is getting a citation from a self righteous police this is a family place maam
not an open air hand job palace
i understand officer
you want to pull those kind of stunts you do it at home
or in the backseat of a car like moral upstanding people do
he hands her a ticket and walks off
the ugly truth numbered script colin walks a defeated abby to her door
nearby mike watches this unseen and impassive
well i cant say it was boring
that was pretty much the all time worst first date ever
mike looks worried
to abby where are you going with this
no guy wants to hear that
no no i take full responsibility
sticking out her hand thanks
as he shakes her hand but hey at least your pants are clean
he smiles amused
youre not what im used to
sighing i know
actually thats a good thing
im used to women i can figure out in five seconds
i cant do that with you
mike rolls his eyes
hes an idiot
i figured you out in two
the ugly truth numbered script mike contd now tell him good night and stick your tits out
were going to give this one last shot
sticking her tits out good night
and walk away
she starts to walk away when colin stops her grabbing her arm and pulling her in for a kiss
that definitely made up for my wet crotch
dreamily me too
off his look realizing just scratch that
colin gives a wave and walks toward his condo
abby pretends to enter her house until she sees colin close his front door
then she turns around and rushes over to mike
she throws her arms around him embracing him
you did it
you did it
mike pulls back a little uncomfortable
i didnt do anything
it was you
dont ask me why but i think he likes you
hes really a great guy isnt he
yeah hes dreamy
and he fits all ten criteria on my checklist
the ugly truth numbered script right
werent items one through nine something to do with him pretty much being gay
abby puts her key in the door
im going to ignore that because im in a very good mood
yeah i heard wet crotch
abby rolls her eyes with a smile and goes inside
as mike is walking away he turns back for a moment then keeps walking
jonah and mike sit on the couch playing fight night
so no date tonight
as a matter of fact i did have a date
it wasnt mine but it was a date
i was helping out a friend
guy or girl
is she hot
she would be if she were less irritating
so she likes to make fun of your clothes and stuff
no actually i make fun of hers
you told me not to do that
the ugly truth numbered script thats right
and you should listen to me
if you know so much about chicks why are you sitting here playing fight night with me when you could be out with the jello girls
because this is better
elizabeth enters wearing a pair of sweats and carrying her laptop
she hands mike a digital camera
hurry take a picture of me
im online with fugly and he wants to know what i look like
you really want to go out with a guy named fugly
hes being ironic
look hes hot
she holds up her laptop
mike peers at it
thats jim morrison
who im pretty sure isnt an accountant in rio rancho
are you serious
jonah holds out his hand to his mom
you owe me a dollar
what are you wasting your time on the internet for anyway
says the man who hasnt had a decent relationship since
at least i date
the ugly truth numbered script no
a cage of randy bonobos getting it on
mike in a gorilla suit does a segment
next to him is an anthropologist dr
of all primates bonobos are the closest relatives to human beings both genetically and socially especially when it comes to sex
for the bonobo sex is a way to ease stress and diffuse tensions
so summing up bonobo land the chicks look great get freaky in bed and in turn they get to sit on their asses and boss their men around all day
thats one way of looking at it
if thats not an argument for evolution i dont know what is
he winks at the camera as cut
mike walks over to join her
what did you think
it was good
did you hear corporates taking me to saffron tonight
what do you think
the ugly truth numbered script cutting him off colin called
he wants to get together again
he starts pulling off his gorilla suit as he heads for the van
abby follows him
how long do you think i should wait to sleep with him
the more you make him beg for it the more youve got him on the hook
do everything but
then show him beneath that control freak exterior theres a sexual deviant waiting to be unleashed
i am not a sexual deviant
if memory serves us right youve been out of practice for what
alright well how often do you do i what
under his breath flick the bean
mike throws her a look
abby catches on
the ugly truth numbered script ewww gross
thats what you call it
no i call it masturbating but i thought it would offend your delicate lady like sensibilities
how often do you flick it
how often do you flick it
you only want me to answer that so you can picture me flicking mine while you flick yours
trust me i would never think about you while im flicking it
not that i would ever do that
abby looks away haughtily
i find it impersonal
what could be more personal
i just dont think of myself that way
well you need to start
because if you dont want to have sex with you why the hell should colin
abby opens the door to find a gift bag on her doorstep with a card that reads this present isnt for you
its for your bean
the ugly truth numbered script abby sits on the couch staring at a box of electric she opens the box dumping out a pair of underwear and a remote control
when she turns on the remote the underwear vibrates startling her
she turns it off
abby checks herself out in the mirror
now in the underwear
she downs a glass of wine sits on the bed and picks up the remote
she turns it on
she tries again
abby smacks the remote a few times
the doorbell rings
shouting who is it
frowning one second abby quickly throws on her skirt and hurries toward the living room
abby heads toward the door but quickly realizes shes still holding the remote
she tosses it in her purse then opens the door
mike stands there out of breath dressed in a suit
you have to come with me
my dinner with corporate
i dont want to fuck it up
the ugly truth numbered script i cant
i have a date with colin
well pick him up on the way
mike im not going on your dinner
so if it doesnt go well and they cut the segment and the ratings go back down to negative fourteen and they cancel the show youre cool with that
abby thinks a moment then let me get my purse
colin opens the door to find abby standing there
hey youre early yeah
mike pops out from behind abby
change in plans
grab your keys
we gotta go
as colin looks confused we cut to mikes driving
in the passenger seat abby turns to colin who sits in the back
well just stay for one drink
im really sorry about this
to mike are you a news producer as well
the ugly truth numbered script no dude im the talent
so youre one of the anchors
no the ugly truth
to abby hasnt he ever seen our show
not everyone wants to start their day by watching you rant about implants and g strings
to mike you talk about g strings
as abby mike and colin walk into the bar two buxom blonde twin jello girls bambi and candi rush up to mike
youre looking quite fetching
do you like my dress
she leans over and displays her cleavage
displeased are these the jello girls
yeah theyre my dates
she tries to control her displeasure as stuart walks in with two guys in suits bob and harold in their s
hey the gangs all here
abby you know harold and bob
the ugly truth numbered script of course
ignoring abby and we all know mike alexander
they slap him on the back eyeing the twins
and who are these lovely ladies
something tells me we wont be talking about the news tonight
the group sits down at the table
so you guys here to give me a raise or what
abby tries to kick mike
as she does she unwittingly knocks over her purse
the contents spill out and the remote for her vibrating underwear rolls away stopping under the table a precocious kid sits with his parents
bored out of his skull
when the remote rolls under his feet the kid picks it up and flicks the switch
a small red light turns on
as harold and bob laugh stuart slaps mike on the back
thats my guy
always with the jokes
abby turns to bob and harold
were really excited about the ratings increase this year
next quarter we hope to suddenly her smile quickly changes to horror
the ugly truth numbered script abby contd oh god
she shifts in her seat trying to control her now vibrating whats wrong
she leans down to grab her purse
she pokes her head under the table to see that the contents of her purse have spilled
mikes head appears next to hers
what are you doing
im looking for the remote
gritting her teeth for
mike starts laughing
youre wearing them
she writhes again hitting her head on the bottom of the table
stuart watches worried as abby rises from underneath the table clutching her head and looking around frantically trying to figure out who has the remote
the kid has flicked up the speed on the remote even higher
abbys eyes roll back
she looks like shes on three hits of ecstasy
the ugly truth numbered script are you okay
this ceviche is just so
im going to ask the chef for the ooh recipe
excuse me she starts to get up when stuart stops her
tell harold about the new teaser campaign were starting next week
to harold youre going to love this

abby glares at mike and sits back down
well its fifteen seconds
as she fumbles mike spots the kid at the next table remote in hand
he starts to get up but abby contd theyre very oh
abby grabs mikes arm yanking him back down in the throes of panic and pleasure
abby contd mike
you tell them
she looks into his eyes imploring
actually im really enjoying the way youre telling them
candi looks at harold intrigued by abbys display
whats in a ceviche
as stuart frowns concerned abby spasms then rushes through it as fast as she can
the ugly truth numbered script rapid fire its fifteen seconds every hour of mike telling an ugly truth and
god theyre good
she leaps to her feet
abby contd ohhhhh
then she sinks back down spent
harold and bob applaud as do the twins
relieved stuart turns to bob and harold
see what i mean about her
proudly youve got to love her enthusiasm
as they all walk out mike grabs the remote from the kid
sorry buddy thats my toy
abby spots this and snatches the remote out of mikes hand
you knew he had it the whole time didnt you
no just part of the time
figured i should let you finish
she shoots him a look
mike contd seriously thanks for coming tonight
i mean you know to dinner
you would have done fine without me
the ugly truth numbered script stuart schmoozes with harold bob bambi and candi at the valet stand
abby and mike exit the restaurant
he likes you by the way
i can tell
colin walks up
are we ready to go
i know abby is
harold and bob shake hands with mike
keep up the good work mike
and thanks for introducing us to our future ex wives
you kids play safe
they take off with the twins
mike turns to abby and colin
so whats next
a little three way scrabble
maybe a massage chain
we could write in each others diaries
i think weve got it from here
mikes truck pulls up and he gets in
dont do anything i wouldnt do
he drives away
abby smiles at colin as a punk rock version of getting to know you plays and a montage begins
colin and abby ride the tram up the mountain snuggling
the ugly truth numbered script abby and colin are watching to catch a thief
colin puts his arm around abby
i cant believe ive never seen this before
abby grins pleased
mikes on set rehearsing with a hot girl next to him
nearby abby gets flowers delivered
mike tries not to be distracted by abbys delighted expression as she reads the card
at the counter abby introduces colin to joy
as colin turns away to get his latte joy falls to the ground in a mock swoon
colin sees this and concerned rushes to help joy up
mike stands at the sports bar with dwayne steve and gary as a drunk guy praises mike
to mike dude you got me laid three times last month
drinks are on me
just doing my job
just then a cute brunette in a tight t shirt and ridiculously gynormous implants walks up
i got implants just like you said
horrified indeed you did
heres to implants
steve clinks his beer bottle against mikes
youre a rock star bro
the ugly truth numbered script mike sips his beer looking a bit wary of his powers
a waiter takes colin and abbys order
a bottle of water to start
yes a bottle of flat please
she starts to say something then smiles at the waiter
ill have one too
colin smiles at her as the montage ends
a sign on the upscale bar window advertises happy hour ladies drink for half price
mike has a beer and enjoys the scenery as abby sits across from him at their table making notes
the balloon fiesta is coming up so i was thinking for sweeps we could do a segment on how men are full of hot air
he doesnt answer
abby contd i was kidding mike isnt even listening
hes watching a trashy redhead at the bar
abby contd colin would never like a girl like that
i forgot colin only likes women of quality
the ugly truth numbered script thats a trait to be admired not mocked man whore
who says im a man whore
ive seen you with the funbag twins remember
you saw me what
take them to dinner and introduce them to some network executives
they want to be actresses
who am i to kill their dreams
youre telling me youve never slept with those girls
i didnt say that
exactly my point
man whores want women who wear slutty clothes and suck lots of cock
every man wants that
and for your information i was only with the one who can read
then did you just say cock
i can say cock
you dont own that word
i said it again
a week ago you cried at the thought of a vibrator
now youre all cock this cock that
then you had sex with colin didnt you
were saving that for this weekend
hes taking me to santa fe
the ugly truth numbered script you sure youre ready for that
of course im ready
you dont sound ready
well i am ready
mike holds up a glass
heres to overturning assumptions
im really a man of discriminating taste and youre a foul mouthed slut
on set mike addresses the camera
so there you have it
never assume a girl is easy or assume shes a prude
there are many layers in between and its your job gentlemen to peel back those layers and figure out exactly what type of woman you are dealing with
nearby a confused joy looks at abby
what happened to him
that sounded almost enlightened
abby doesnt know weather to be pleased or worried
because once you do peel back those layers my friends her lady garden awaits
and im pretty sure youre gonna want to fertilize that patch of petunias
and that there is the ugly truth
and hes back
the ugly truth numbered script larry turns to the camera
next up javier tells us if your petunias are going to see any rainfall this weekend
georgia winks at him
i hope mine do
abby rolls her eyes as mike walks up
yes the city gets treated to flower vagina metaphors
georgia okeefe would be so pleased
at this a slick agent in a suit s walks up and slaps mike on the shoulder
are you ready for this
i just got you on to the tonight show
they want you as a guest
mike is stunned
jay leno wants me on his show
youre shitting me
abby looks at the agent confused
who are you
this is rick
since when do you have an agent
since he became the hottest thing in morning tv
this is amazing
the ugly truth numbered script trying to process yeah
you leave tomorrow
lets go clear it with stuart
to abby how cool is this
they walk off as abby stands there
abby runs a programming meeting
joy dori josh georgia and larry are in attendance
whats our story at the top of the hour
oh im sorry did anna nicole come back from the dead
stuart pokes his head in
i need you
she rises and goes out into the hall
abby frowns at stuarts serious expression
i just found out mike was offered a job by the local nbc affiliate at twice the pay
this leno thing is his audition
the ugly truth numbered script what
if bob and harold find out about this were dead
i need you to fly out there and talk him out of it
but im going to santa fe ignoring her just dont let him know you know beforehand
let him do the show and get us our publicity then convince him to sign with us for the next three years
an airplane lands at lax
a pissed abby sits in the cab having a conversation with herself
hi stupid motherfucker whod still be on cable access if it werent for me
i hear youre moving to the cab driver looks at her
what did you just call me
just practicing my speech
mike walks out of the lobby as abby gets out of a cab suitcase in hand
what are you doing here
abby glares at him about to show her true feelings but then quickly covers
the ugly truth numbered script stuart decided you needed a cheerleader
i thought you were going to santa fe
apparently he felt that you needed a producer more than i needed to get laid
abby and mike sit in the backseat
abby looks down at her notes
okay so lets go over the pre interview questions
mike studies her
im sorry you didnt get to meet little colin this weekend
and by little i dont mean undersized although i highly suspect thats the case
thats what you want to talk about right now
i was thinking maybe we should talk about what youre gonna say on the show
doing jay so tell me mike
how did the ugly truth start
well jay i had a sales job where i drove around a lot listening to talk radio
i started calling in and lo and behold people liked what i had to say
then i decided what the hell i need my own show
i have a message people need to hear
abby rolls her eyes still angry with him
the ugly truth numbered script yes thousands of lives are being enriched by your wisdom
excuse me lady but you have a boyfriend right now because of me
it may have started because of you but its lasted because of me
so youve been acting like your normal control freak psycho self in front of him
im not a control freak
when you checked into the hotel did you or did you not insist on getting an eastern facing room on a floor not below seven
i like rising with the sun
and a view
my point is colin likes the mike version of abby not the abby version of abby
so dont go knocking my words of wisdom when youre living proof that they work
abby sits there fuming that hes right
i could be having sex right now yeah thanks to me
a tonight show handler in a headset readies a visibly nervous mike backstage
mikes agent stands next to him giving him a pep talk as abby watches skeptically
the ugly truth numbered script dude this is awesome
youre about to go on leno
nbc is going to give you the moon mike shoots him a shut up look
abby pretends not to notice
in a gift basket of course
this isnt helping
just do what you always do
what do i always do
uh cutting him off you entertain people with your moronery
and they love you for it
mike looks at her surprised
that might be the nicest thing youve ever said to me
she smiles at him
looking a little calmer he smiles back at abby
the agent rolls his eyes
the handler gives mike the nod as we hear and that was kiku the penguin that flies
next up here to tell us the ugly truth is mike alexander the audience applauds as mike takes a deep breath and heads on stage
abby now sits in the audience watching as jay interviews mike on stage
the ugly truth numbered script so whats your number one piece of advice to all the people out there who are trying to find love
dont do it
try to find lust instead
its a lot easier and a lot less messy
blue balls only last a few hours
a broken heart can last years
the audience reacts with hollers and cheers
abby shakes her head
so whats her name
the girl who screwed you up
she must have been a doozy
mike looks a bit taken aback but recovers quickly
like i said better a floozy than a doozy
abby cocks her head intrigued by mikes reaction
well what do you say to guys like me who have been happily married for twenty seven years
we cant be the exception to the rule can we
theres plenty of us out there
well jay let me tell ya he hesitates then looks at abby for a moment
she gives him an encouraging nod
he gains confidence and continues
marriage starts off great
shes cute youre cute the worlds cute
nothing can burst your bubble of everlasting love
the ugly truth numbered script mike contd then ten years later shes put on twenty pounds youve got nose hair youre voting for different presidents and one day the receptionist
at jiffy lube accidentally grazes your hand as she hands you back your keys and you realize thats the first time a womans touched you in three months
by year twenty youve learned to completely tune out the sound of her voice and it occurs to you that ever since you walked down the aisle youre living with
someone who can barely tolerate your presence and on the rare occasion that you actually do make love she probably thinks about jake gyllenhaal
jay looks stricken going along with the bit
im going to get a divorce
my whole life is a lie
to camera sorry honey
the audience laughs as we cut to stuart flips off the tv talking on his cell phone
into phone did you get him
is he ours
abby talks on the phone
tense im working on it
she hangs up as mike and his agent approach
abby contd to mike you were amazing out there
the ugly truth numbered script was i
to abby you go ahead and hold our table doll
weve got some business to discuss
they walk off
abby fumes then does her self hating spazzy dance
a festive cuban place in hollywood with a live salsa band and a floor full of sexy patrons salsa dancing
abby sits at a table waiting anxiously
as mike walks in she waves him over
confused wheres rick
i sent him home
i thought we should celebrate on our own
abbys surprised then suspicious
what exactly are we celebrating
i was just on it
maybe you saw
the waiter arrives with mojitos
abby looks at him
i know about the offer from nbc
he looks at her surprised then okay well then you know i turned it down
if it werent for you id still be on channel
so dont worry im not going anywhere
the ugly truth numbered script relax
you did your job
im re signing with you
now lets stop talking about work
abby sips her mojito studying mike
who was the doozy
what are you trying to kill my buzz
no im interested
in what makes you
mike sighs deciding to level with her
it wasnt just one
it was more like a parade
by the time i hit thirty i realized you can only have so many bad relationships before you figure out theres no such thing as a good one
you cant really believe theres no such thing as a good relationship
to my very core
just then the waitress walks up
two more mojitos
and some water please
still or sparkling
just bring us tap water
she nods and leaves
abby stares at him
the ugly truth numbered script mike contd off her look what
its the exact same thing isnt it
so ive been told
he stands up
cmon lets dance
i dont think so
ive seen your spazzy dance now i want to see the real thing
abby looks out at the dance floor seeing that even the worst dancers are great
i cant dance like that
mike grabs her hand and leads her onto mike and abby make their way onto the crowded dance floor
mike no youll be fine
abby looks at him sure that hes about to make a fool of them both
then he takes her in his arms completely self assured and starts leading her in a salsa dance and
but not just good
oh my god
how did you learn to
the ugly truth numbered script she follows his moves half shocked and half turned on
he pulls her in a bit closer and for the first time she allows herself to be led without trying to control the situation
for about five seconds
then she looks at her watch
abby contd weve got an early flight tomorrow
we should go
mike and abby ride up the elevator
so the cars picking us up downstairs at eight
you want me to call you
ill get a wake up call
theres a moment of uncomfortable silence
abby contd contd i had a great time
remember the cars picking us up at eight
the elevator comes to a stop
see you tomorrow
bright and early
its long hug
they give a quick kiss
abby contd contd good night
the ugly truth numbered script good night
neither lets go
they give a longer kiss
mike starts out the elevator then returns grabbing abby
and suddenly theyre all over each other
in the midst of this the elevators try to close but their furious groping blocks it until a shrill buzzing begins
they abruptly step apart staring at each other
mike contd so i guess i should yeah
mike backs out of the elevator looking shell shocked
the doors close
abby is flushed and stunned
abby contd wow
abby sinks down onto her bed wearing the same expression
what the hell was that
and why do i want to do it again
theres a knock at the door
she leaps up smooths her hair checks her reflection and goes to the door
opening it with a smile she finds standing there bottle of red wine in hand is
it takes a moment for abby to adjust
the ugly truth numbered script colin
you were expecting someone else
recovering uh no he walks in the room holding up the wine
since you couldnt come to santa fe i decided to come to you
howd you find me
joy told me
i started thinking about all the things we were going to do there and i decided i couldnt wait
whats the matter
im just so surprised to see you
well you told me you were spontaneous
guess the proof is in the pudding
tense it sure is
as he opens the wine some of it splashes on his shirt
looks like well have to get naked sooner than i thought
mike approaches abbys door
the ugly truth numbered script abby i really need to kiss you again
and not just in a one night stand way in a totally different way
oh fuck what am i doing
he turns and walks the other direction
then stops and turns back
mike contd nut up alexander
you can do this
he knocks on abbys door
after a second it opens and theres colin standing there shirtless
oh youre not room service
holding out his hand how ya doin man
mike reels trying to cover his shock
i just came by to tell abby about the change in our flight time
but i can tell her later
abby appears behind colin
mike what are you doing here
he turns and goes
mike walks down the hall freaked out and perturbed
abby runs to catch up with him
mike he keeps walking as she tries to keep up
abby contd he just showed up to surprise me
the ugly truth numbered script how convenient
i thought it was you at the door
he stops and looks at her
i guess were all interchangeable
ive taught you well
maybe you should take over the show
he starts to walk off
mike wait tell me what just happened in the elevator
they hold eye contact for a very long moment
abby contd should i tell colin to go
mike looks away
why pull up anchor now
youve worked damn hard to get him here
thats all you have to say
what else do you want me to say
but hes not saying it
i guess the truth is ugly isnt it
thats what ive been telling you
he shrugs and walks off
abby enters the room
colin stands there still shirtless
the ugly truth numbered script sorry about that
he was upset about his performance on leno
the rest of the night is ours
he pours her a glass of wine
colin contd to the first of many romantic evenings to come
abby takes the glass and drinks
and keeps drinking
colin contd whoa abby finishes the glass and looks at him
why do you like me
well youre beautiful youre smart abby smiles pleased then he continues
colin contd contd youre open you laugh at my jokes you never criticize
abbys smile fades
colin contd contd you never try to control the situation and ive got to say its a breath of fresh air
a lot of women i know are total control freaks and its a nightmare
i love that youre not like that
abby looks at him nodding then you know what
i am like that
what do you mean
the ugly truth numbered script to be honest i didnt like the way you poured the wine
i would have decanted it
and i was editing that speech as you were giving it
she looks around
abby contd contd plus this bed should be facing north south instead of east west
confused are you serious
i havent been myself for one second of the two weeks and five days weve been dating
then who have you been
the girl some idiot told me to be
taxis drop off tourists
abby paces in front of the gate and checks her watch while talking on her cell phone
into phone and youre sure he checked out
she hangs up the phone
a flight attendant approaches her
miss were going to need you to board now
resigned she picks up her bag and walks on board
abby walks into the station greeting the security guard
the ugly truth numbered script morning freddy
the security guard just looks at her and shakes his head disappointed
stuart rushes up to her
i thought you said we had him
what are you talking about
he quit this morning
i got a smug call from channel saying they closed a deal with him
corporates having a shit fit
what the hell happened
abby is hurt and stunned but overcomes it with fierce and abiding hatred
we dont need mike alexander
hes a dime a dozen
you better hope so because youre going to find me a new one by the end of the week
abby and joy walk through the waiting area which is filled with mike alexander replacement hopefuls of all different shapes and sizes
abby points at candidates while joy makes notes on a clipboard
then i cant believe i even considered for a second allowing myself to feel something for him
i still cant believe that you broke up with colin
i know i cant control everything
as much as id like to
the ugly truth numbered script abby contd but i should at least be able to decide who i feel something for and who im repulsed by
she turns back to the candidates frustrated
abby contd yes
channel s brighter and more expensive stage with a prominent logo for morning mayhem with mike
mike dressed in an armani suit glandhands the channel suits as they show him around
what do you think of the new set
kphx retained the copyright to your old segment title so we retitled you morning mayhem with mike
mikes on autopilot
and this is joe your new producer
mike finally wakes up a bit
turns to joe a balding nebbish
you know what i like best about you joe
i dont want to have sex with you at all
im relieved to hear that
the big wigs chortle
how much do we love this guy
the ugly truth numbered script mike in his suit walks up the front steps
jonah sits on a lawn chair drinking a soda and watching hundreds of multi colored multi shaped hot air balloons are aloft
dude check it out
why do you look like a lawyer
youre never going to get any pussy looking like that
annoyed where do you get this stuff
look at me jonah
im im still single i live alone
does it look like its all working out
if theres one thing you dont want to be its like me
as he opens the door and goes inside jonah calls out im pretty sure you dont want to open your new show with that
on the field that is covered with hot air balloons and their pilots and aficionados abby and joy stand with mikes replacement jack magnum a fast talking slickster who thinks
hes really fucking cool
the ugly truth numbered script hows my skin
how are my pores
which side is better
joy looks at abby a little worried
theyre all fine
but lets go over your intro
prompting him im jack magnum and this is
the ugly truth
he fake smiles and does the point and shoot going so far as to blow the smoke off his fingertip gun
lets maybe lose the gun
the gun is my signature move
impatient unless the nra is paying your mortgage this month i say lose the fucking gun
and were live in five four three two stuart sits in the control room next to cliff
think this guys any good
he better be
the ugly truth numbered script jack magnum does his intro now standing in a balloon basket
and this is the ugly truth
jack starts to do the gun but then he remembers and awkwardly turns it into a peace sign
hes going political
jonah watches tv as mike gets a beer out of the fridge
dude check this out
your replacements on
mike looks over to see on the tv live footage from the balloon fiesta
jack magnum continues to alienate his audience
most of you are watching this show so you can learn how to get chicks
let me assure you youre in good hands
youre looking at a guy whos personally had sex with over women
most of them conscious
abby looks at joy panicked
hes ad libbing
why is he ad libbing
theres no ad libbing
mike sits down on the couch to watch
oh this is beautiful
the ugly truth numbered script on tv jack magnum just makes it worse
were here at the balloon fiesta and im supposed to be telling you men are full of hot air but i think we all know its the ladies that are
full of crap
just because she says no doesnt mean she means no
at this jack magnum is tackled and pushed out of the balloon basket
after a moment a frazzled abby pops up in his place
im sorry but jack magnum will no longer be able to do the ugly truth segment
which should really come as no surprise
because men are completely unreliable
stuart and cliff watch from the control room in shock
what is she doing
the phone rings
stuart picks up then blanches
into phone hey harold
yes i know were fixing it
abby stands in the basket still nervous but flying on adrenaline
joy gives her a keep going hand gesture
take mike alexander for instance
he up and quit the show without so much as a word
you think you know what men are going to do you think you know what they want to do
but when it comes down to the moment where they actually have to nut up they turn around and do something completely different
the ugly truth numbered script mike stares at abby on tv for a second then grabs his keys
oh im all over this
he races out as jonah calls after him
i dont think shes into you guy
joy and the camera guy watch as abby gains steam ranting to the camera
b camera strapped to the basket also records
the big strong romantic men weve been reading about in novels and watching in movies since we were nine
blue lagoon is a total freakin lie
men are not strong
men are not brave
men are afraid
from the news desk georgia and larry watch the monitor confused
offended i love blue lagoon
georgia squeezes his hand
i know you do honey
mikes truck careens into the parking lot
he gets out racing towards the field
abby is now on a total tear
theyre afraid to say what they feel
afraid to grow up
afraid to tell the truth
the ugly truth numbered script jonah watches entranced
its like shes in his brain
mike pushes through the crowd of balloon lovers
abby continues her impassioned tirade
even if they have a moment in a hotel elevator thats totally romantic and filled with potential men are completely incapable of copping to it
because men are weak
let me tell you something about women
she turns to see mike standing there
he pushes past joy and climbs into the balloon
grabbing the mic from abbys hand
hey ignoring her to camera women would have us believe that they are the victims
they want us to think that we break their hearts for sport
they say they want romance
they say they want true love but all they want is a checklist
is he perfect
is he handsome
is he a doctor
a confused cliff looks at stuart whos still on the phone
i thought he quit
the ugly truth numbered script now elated into phone see
i told you shed get him back
abby glares at mike
that is not true
by the cameraman joy shrugs
well kinda true
mike continues his rant
you men that fit the criteria dont kid yourselves
theyre not sleeping with you
theyre sleeping with a carefully calculated set of venal choices
money over substance
looks over soul
polish over principles
no gesture no matter how real or romantic will ever compensate for a really impressive list of credentials
says the man whos never made a gesture except for this one she makes the universally known jack off hand gesture
so the elevator wasnt a gesture
the elevator was a moment of passion followed by a moment of panic on your part apparently
stuart looks at cliff
the ugly truth numbered script mike glares at abby
i came by your room
and then you ran away
well that wasnt panic sweetheart
it was an unwillingness to compete with the walking checklist that was in your bed
you should be thanking me
nearby joy taps her watch
we have ten seconds
an overzealous balloon pilot walks up
are we ready to soar up up and away
in the basket mike looks at the camera
and thats the ugly truth folks
a girl in heat for two guys will always pick the one with the better resume
behind him the pilot silently boards the balloon
that is bullsh the torch of the balloon is suddenly fired covering her fbc violation
the cameraman follows the balloon as it slowly starts to rise
and were out
then sotto keep rolling on b camera
the ugly truth numbered script abby glares at mike not realizing theyre still on the air
freaked i hate you so much i just swore on live television
no you hate yourself for being so shallow
off we go
abby and mike spin around to look at him
realizing the balloon is now soaring upwards
where are we going
im not going anywhere with you
mike starts to climb out
what a shock
i wouldnt recommend that
mike looks down to see they are now fifteen feet above the ground
he stops climbing as the balloon continues to float up and away
pilot contd so who wants champagne
stuart and cliff stare at the monitors eating it up
they dont know the camera is on do they
smiling nuh uh
the ugly truth numbered script now holding champagne glasses a disgusted mike and abby look at opposite ends of the sky hating that they are trapped together
i know we can pass the time with you telling me how much fun you and colin had having sex in los angeles
i broke up with colin in los angeles jackass
mike is thrown turning to look at her
to our left we have the sandia mountains glistening in the afternoon twilight
abby ignores the pilot
oh that got your interest
if you think were going to finish what we started in la youre out of your mind
you lost your chance
and to our right youll see the rio grande river winding its way through the diochramatic landscape
mike ignores the pilot as well
i never had a chance with you
and off in the distance we have the petroglyph national monument where to the pilot can you stop talking please
the ugly truth numbered script abby contd to mike youre right
i had a momentary lapse in judgement where i thought you might be more than you are
but you arent
what does that mean
mocking im mike alexander
i like girls in jello
i like to fuck like a monkey
dont fall in love its scary
joy talks on the phone to stuart
dont worry i saw this coming so i got us a three second delay
mike glares at abby
yeah it is scary
its fucking terrifying
especially because im in love with a psycho like you
jonah now sits with elizabeth
they both stare at the tv in shock
did he just say love
georgia and larry look at each other
i knew it
the ugly truth numbered script abby stares at mike
i am not a psycho
i just told you i loved you and all you heard was psycho
you are the definition of neurotic
the definition of neurotic is a person who suffers from anxiety obsessional thoughts compulsive acts and physical ailments without having any objective evidence of disease again i just told you
im in love with you and youre standing here giving me a vocabulary lesson
to the pilot back me up on this buddy
who here is afraid
im just going to drink my champagne
skeptical youre in love with me
beats the shit out of me but i am
abby opens her mouth about to make a retort then realizes whats been said to her
for the first time in her life she stops thinking and grabs mike and kisses the hell out of him
the sheer force of her kissing throws them into the pilot causing the torch to flame radically
the balloon whooshes upwards
the ugly truth numbered script an elated stuart picks up the phone
into phone joy how do you feel about a promotion
on the phone joy hi fives the cameraman then quickly composes herself
into phone i feel good about it
abby finally loosens her grip on mike
hair askew he looks a little like hes been hit by a cyclone
breathless if you say just kidding im going to throw you out of this balloon and watch your body splatter to the ground
are you going to threaten me with death when we have sex
because it might be distracting
the pilot looks worried for his safety
may i suggest you wait until we land
abby and mike keep kissing as the balloon sails into the sunset and we fade to black then cut to close on mike as he addresses the camera
he holds a mic wears a tuxedo and speaks in a hushed voice
the ugly truth numbered script as many of you know sometimes a guys gotta admit what he thought was the truth isnt necessarily the whole truth
yes women have a checklist but sometimes that list includes a foul mouthed idiot who took way too long to realize he was in love
holds up a finger lets continue this conversation in a second
we pull back to reveal mike is standing in a garden with rows and rows of wedding guests seated behind him
an altar with flowers and a minister wait patiently
mike gestures for the camera to follow him as he makes his way up to the altar
as he arrives he greets his groomsman jonah also wearing a tux
he only has eyes for joy abbys bridesmaid
to joy has anyone ever told you you have a stupendous bosom
not lately so feel free to say it again
a string quartets version of here comes the bride begins as we pan over to see abby in a wedding dress about to make her way up the aisle
looking absolutely beautiful
wowed to camera zoom in on this guys
i want the whole city to see how lucky i am
the cameraman zooms in on abby as she catches mikes eye and smiles
in the audience elizabeth takes photo after photo
her date a dead ringer for jim morrison looks at her amused
the ugly truth numbered script what
no ones ever going to believe this
i need proof
at the altar abby finally arrives and looks at mike
re the cameras whats this
hope you dont mind but were live
re the cameraman no whats jorge doing so close
we need a master
surprised you knew about this
im the producer
its sweeps week
how do you think i got them to pay for this
she gestures to bob and harold from corporate who sit in the audience
mike looks momentarily surprised then god i love you
he turns to the camera
so here it is guys
the games the manipulation the ploys the tactics
all the things we do to think were in control
but guess what
we never are
abby leans over his shoulder
to the camera isnt it beautiful
