written by gus van sant based on a novel by tom robbins there is a huge ancient hourglass made of animal skins and acorns plop through the waist of the
hourglass one by one
it sits in a pool of water
in the water swim eyeless catfish in geometric patterns
an underground stream feeds the pool of water and then flows into a huge underground crevasse that on occasion emits a low rumble
indians with torches surround the hourglass which now we can see is in a cave
and as soon as the acorns have finished passing through the hourglass a crew of indians turn it on its opposite end
one of the indians appears to be japanese
one indian stands at the wall of the cavern in front of a series of symbolic carvings and scratches with stone in hand he makes a few hatchmarks and keeps
an eye on the the crevasse rumbles once more loosening a few chunks of rock from the cave
the earth begins to shake
she is restless tonight
she dreams of loving
she has the blues
view of the chartkeepers drawings
one is of a crane with a very long neck
another is a primitive drawing of a naked girl who has long flowing hair
she also has pointed out from her sides thumbs that are three times normal human proportions
a musical chorus sounds at the sight of this drawing of a girl with the thumbs
the chartkeeper puts the finishing touches on the drawing
and the song happy birthday to you strikes up on country and western guitar and polka like accordion
title we see candles burning on a cake
it is somebodys birthday
and there are six candles on the cake
sissy hankshaw is six years old
her daddy and a visiting uncle finishing their rendition of happy birthday are staring down at sissy and looking at her young thumbs which are unusually large and twitch with
a mind of their own
she manages to blow out all six candles
well youre lucky that you dont suck em
sissy couldnt suck em shed need a mouth like a fish tank
sissy is negotiating a fork full of birthday cake dropping it because of her thumbs
agrees the poor little tyke might have a hard time finding herself a hubby
but as far as getting along in the world its a real blessing that sissys a girl child
lord i reckon this youngun would never make a mechanic
nope and not a brain surgeon neither
course shed do pretty good as a butcher
she could retire in two years on the overcharges alone
laughing the men walk to the kitchen to fill their glasses
sissy is left to feel sorry for herself in front of her cake
one thing that youngun would make one hell of a hitchhiker
this startles sissy
a new word that tinkles in her head with a supernatural echo
sissy looks at her thumbs
if she was a boy i mean
dreyfus looks over sissys thumbs
she is if i may speak frankly somewhat of a medical oddity
due to impaired dexterity her life activities and career potentialities will be reduced
it could be worse
bring her back to me if there ever is pain
meanwhile she will have to learn to live with them
that she will
that she will
the lord made them things big for a purpose
god dont never git tired of testing our kind
its a punishment of some sort for what i dont rightly know
whimpering oh doc if a young man ever shows up here with a young man with ugly fingers you know something similar a similar case doc would you please
remember the words of the painter paul gauguin dear lady
the ugly may be beautiful the pretty never
i dont suppose that means very much to you
its a judgement
shes gotta bear the punishment
sissy beams serenely like a christ figure
sissy looks up thumb in the dictionary
it says the short thick first or most preaxial digit of the human hand differing from the other fingers by having two phalanges and greater freedom of movement
sissy mouthing the words greater freedom of movement
sissy very timidly ventures a pass with her gigantic right thumb in the direction she is walking
she is passed by
a pontiac skids ever so slightly on the snowflakes
view of the pontiac insignia on the hood of the car
sissy runs actually sweating to its side
she peers in
outside a palmists trailer is a sign with a red silhouette of a hand
directly under the wrist where the watch band would be is written madame zoe
madam zoe in kimono and wig lets sissy and her mother in the door
i am the enlightened madame zoe
madame zoe begins stubbing a cigarette in one of those enlightened little ceramic ashtrays that are shaped like bedpans and inscribed butts
the trailer is cluttered but not one knick knack chintz curtain or chenille covered armchair seems to have come from the beyond
there is nothing about your past present or future that your hands do not know and there is nothing about your hands that madame zoe does not know
there is no hocus pocus involved
i am a scientist not a magician
i madame zoe chiromancer lifelong student of the moldings and markings of the human hand
i madame zoe to whom no facet of your character or destiny is not readily revealed
i am prepared to
then she notices the thumbs
jesus fucking christ
hankshaw and the fortune teller turn pale and uncertain while sissy recognizes with a faint smile that she is in command
sissy extends the thumbs as an ailing aborigine might extend his swollen parts to a medical missionary
sissys mama draws a neatly folded five dollar bill from her change purse and extends it alongside her smiling daughters extremities
madame zoe returns to her senses and takes sissy by the elbow to sit at a for mica topped table of undistinguished design
madam zoe holds sissys hands while she appears to go into a trance
she opens her eyes momentarily
you have a strong will
will power and determination are indicated by the first phalanx
the second phalanx indicates reason and logic
you obviously have both in large supply
whats your name dearie
id say that you have an intelligent kindly somewhat artistic nature
however sissy however there is a heavy quality to the second phalanx the phalanx of logic that indicates a capacity for foolish or clownish behavior a refusal to accept responsibility
or to take things seriously and bent to be disrespectful of those who do
your mama tells me that youre pretty well behaved and shy but id watch out for signs of irrationality
she pulls her thumb to her breast
i guess the most important aspect of your thumbs is the ahem over all size
uh what was it do you know that caused
mom speaks out from the couch she is sitting on dont know the doctors dont know
just lucky i guess
do you study history in school
galileo descartes newton
lebinitz had very large thumbs voltaires were enormous but heh heh just pickles compared with yours
what about crazy horse
you mean the indian
nobody that ive ever heard of ever troubled to study the paws of savages
well i guess that about covers the three fifty charge
madame zoe lets go of sissys thumbs and wipes her hands on her kimono
hankshaw withdraws a bill from her rat skin bag
beg your pardon
will she find a husband
oh i see
madame zoe takes sissys hand and gives it the old tall dark stranger squint
i see men in your life honey
i also see women lots of women
she raises her eyes to meet sissys looking for an admission of the tendency but there is no signal
hankshaw does not approve
a husband no doubt about it though he is years away
there are children too
five maybe six but the husband is not the father
they will inherit your characteristics
hankshaw aghast has heard plenty and she ushers her daughter out of the trailer as if she were leading her from a burning cocktail lounge
delores del ruby views of vast vistas of arid grasslands open and unmodulated thirsty and exposed
at the western edge of the dakotas the monotony of the landscape now gradually tilting toward the rockies is interrupted by the badlands sculptured canyons so deep and chaotic they
can break a devils heart
between the grasslands and the eerie badlands ruins there lies a narrow band of humpy hills green and pastoral
the hills are carpeted with midlength prairie grass
the rubber rose buildings are clustered at the badlands end at the base of a butte higher broader and longer than any in its vicinity known as siwash ridge
a sign over the entry of the ranch reads welcome to the rubber rose ranch the largest all girl ranch in the west delores del ruby arrives at the rubber
rose ranch carrying a whip at her side and batting an educated lash at the surrounding sights
ive traveled through the yucatan with a circus popping false eyelashes off a trained monkey with a bullwhip
when i ate peyote one night and had a vision
niwetukame the mother goddess came to me on the back of a doe hummingbirds sipping the tears she was shedding crying delores you must lead my daughters against their natural
you must come to the rubber rose ranch and prepare for your mission the details of which will be revealed to you in a third vision
that night i whipped the shit out of my black lover and ran away
for a while i drove around making a living selling peyote buttons to hippies until i made my way here
a snake crosses the road in front of her and she takes her whip and whirls it around her head
the snake that is crawling across the dusty road that leads to the ranch is carrying a card under its forked tongue
delores snaps her whip at the snake and picks the card out of his mouth and lets it fly in the air
delores catches it
the card is the queen of spades
sissy is thirty years old now wearing a trademark colored jumpsuit
she is saying these words still greater freedom of movement
sissy sticks out her thumb even though there is no traffic
a plane is flying overhead
sissy hitches it and the planes flight path curves with in response to her gesture
a squirrel running by stops to look
the bus on the other side of the road skids to a stop and two cars coming her way stop as well
the man driving looks over the back seat to the hitchiker behind him
the bus driver does the same
from the look of her sissy is a very seasoned hitchhiker and she turns around relatively unimpressed with the fact that a car has stopped for her
the man driving is black skinned beret topped and he has four smiling gold teeth and six shiny brass saxaphones in the back seat
he wears a gardenia in his lapel and tokes on a short joint
you bet your raggedy white ass i am
sissy gets in
he turns up the volume of his radio and rockets north
sissy ventures into her pocket and pulls out a slice of cheese and offers it to him
he now gets a better look at her unusual thumbs
they are elegant but large boned and disproportionate
they are banana shaped boats that makes it a little awkward to hold onto the cheese
taking an alarming interest in her thumbs thanks
the king of road food
he eats the cheese and worries about the thumbs
he tokes on the joint between his fingers
are you in show business
i was a successful model once
i was the yoni yum feminine hygiene dew girl from to but got laid off
so now youre bummin around
im the best
youre the best
when i was younger i hitchhiked one hundred and twenty seven hours without stopping without food or sleep crossed the continent twice in six days cooled my thumbs in both
oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways
as i developed however i grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style
time in terms of m
no longer interested me
i began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time slow ancient vast
when i am really moving stopping car after car after car moving so freely so clearly so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and
let me pass then i embody the rhythms of the universe
i am in a state of grace
the man listening to her takes another toke on his joint
a view down the road of the lincoln continental going swiftly in its direction
credit interlude featuring the song even cowgirls get the blues as sung by an undetermined country or pop star like k
lang or bob dylan in an old television kine scope piece of film like you might see on early s television sets
between sissy watching this image on old motel televisions there are also images of roads cars trucks highways thumbs gas stations and deserts gliding by in a flow of natural
sissy gets out of a large eighteen wheel truck and walks into a united states post office
sissy at the window picking up some mail and opening a lavender colored letter that reeks of perfume she is surprised to read this sissy precious being how are you
my extraordinary one
i worry so
next time you are near manhattan do ring me up
there is a man to whom i simply must introduce you
the countess sissy looks at the envelope and return address
elaborately embossed is the countess logo
the elaborately embossed envelope is now being sealed
the countess gives it a licking
beside him is a young watercolorist named julian
i will send this out to sissy she should get it in a week and you will be able to meet her
when i send a letter to sissy duplicates must be sent to u
post office boxes in laconner taos pine ridge cherokee and that other place for her to pick up
why shes probably out there right now in hibbing minnesota or deluth montana
hitching her way across the country
sissy is talking to a trucker as they pass down the road
right off i dont remember how old i was when i found out i was part indian
my mammas family a lot of them had lived out west in the dakotas and one of them had married a squaw
my pleasure in indianhood and my passion for car travel might be incongruous if not mutually exclusive
after all the first car that ever stopped for me had been named in honor of the great chief of the ottawa pontiac
in the distance sissy spies her destination
new york city
new york city
its still a helluva town
sissy gets out of the truck and looks up at a large building
sit down dear do sit down
sissy hankshaw takes a seat
the countess lifts a dusty decanter
take a load off those lovely tootsies
yes sit right down
would you fancy some sherry
the decanter is empty a stiff fly lies feet up on its lip
shit o goodness im all out of sherry how about some red ripple
he reaches into a midget refrigerator beside his desk and pulls out some pop wine
you know what red ripple is dont you
its kool aid with a hard on
sissy manages a polite smile
she looks at a heavily finger printed glass
he toasts to my own special sissy
so my letter brought ya flying eh
where were you
salt lake city
well i may have a little surprise for you
but first tell me about yourself
its been six months hasnt it
in some circles thats half a year
how are you
thats the very first time in the eons that ive known you that ive ever heard you complain
and now youre tired poor darling
a born freak can only go uphill
most of us are freaks in one way or another
try being born a male russian countess into a white middle class baptist family in mississippi and youll see what i mean
ive always been proud of the way nature singled me out
its the people who have been deformed by society i feel sorry for
ive been steady moving for eleven years and some months
maybe i should rest up for a spell im not as young as i used to be
shit o goodness you wont be thirty for another year and youre more beautiful than ever
does that mean you might have an assignment for me
the countess taps his monocle with his cigarette holder
he looks on his wall and on a poster advertising a feminine hygene product yoni yum dew spray stands sissy hankshaw her thumbs neatly hidden chopped off by the borders
of the photograph
you were the yoni yum girl from lets see peruses the ad layouts on the wall from nineteen sixty eight through nineteen seventy
youve always smelled so nice
like a little sister
the irony has just killed me
you the dew girl one of the few girls who doesnt need dew
i loath the stink of females
they are so sweet the way god made them then they start fooling around with men and soon theyre stinking
like rotten mushrooms like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool like a tuna fishs retirement party
they all stink
from the queen of england to bonanza jellybean they stink
the countesss jaw muscles calm down his dentures ease into a samba
shes a young thing who works on my ranch
real name is sally jones or something wooden like that
shes cute as a hot fudge taco and of course it takes verve to change ones name so charmingly
but she stinks like a slut just the same
oh my dear yes i bought a little ranch out west sort of a tribute to the women of america who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by
using my vaginal products dew spray mist and yoni yum spray powder
a tax write off actually
he looks out his window as a squirrel crosses park avenue
sissy sissy blushing bride you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways
the countess has arranged a job for you
and what a job
a job for me
i am once more about to make advertising history
and only you the original yoni yum dew girl could possibly assist me
the countess hands sissy an article that she reads clenched in her fist
the food and drug administration said wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters burns and rashes
although the fda judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings
shit o dear thats enough to make me asthmatic
the nerve of those twits
what do they know about female odor
heres my concept
my ranch out west
its a beauty ranch
oh its got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes
but its a beauty ranch a place where unhappy women divorcees and widows mainly can go to lose weight remove wrinkles change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for
the next disappointment
my ranch is named the rubber rose after the rubber rose douche bag my own invention and bless its little red bladder the most popular douche bag in the world
so get this
its on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes
the last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence
well these cranes stop off at my little pond siwash lake its called twice a year autumn and spring and spend a few days each time resting up eating doing
whatever whooping cranes do
ive never seen them understand but i hear theyre magnificent
very big specimens i mean huge mothers and white as snow to coin a phrase except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers and bright red heads
now whooping cranes in case you didnt know it are noted for their mating dance
its just the wildest show in nature
its probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons
picture these rare beautiful gigantic birds in full dance leaping six feet off the mud arching their backs flapping their wings strutting low to the ground
dears its overwhelming
and picture the birds doing their sex dance on tv
right there on the home screen creations most elaborate sex ritual yet clean and pure enough to suit the pope
with lovely sissy hankshaw in the foreground
in a white gown red hood attached and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black
in a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane she dance walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of yoni yum
and a can of dew
off camera a string quartet is playing debussy
a sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love
are you starting to get it
doesnt it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud
my very goodness gracious
grandiose lyrical erotic and girl scout oriented you cant top it
ive hired a crew of experts from walt disney studios the best wildlife cinematographers around
youre my eternal favorite
princess grace herself couldnt be better not even if she had your personality which she doesnt anyway dear im out of photography now and into water colors
ah how circuitous conversation is
were back at the beginning
the exact man ive wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist
sissy dares a sip of red ripple
if you dont want me to pose for him why do you want me to meet him
i believe you might enjoy one another
dont get exasperated
i realize that youve always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men and i might add youve been wise
heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage
for men marriage is a matter of efficient logistics the male gets his food bed laundry tv pussy offspring and creature comforts all under one roof where he doesnt have
to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life which is what existence is all about
but for a woman marriage is surrender
the countess refills his glass
the squirrel starts across park avenue again but doesnt make it
the uniformed chauffeur gets out of a limousine and holds the crushed animal up where it can be seen by an elderly woman passenger
but here you are still a virgin you are virginal yet arent you
why yes technically
jack kerouac and i came awfully close but he was afraid of me i think
yes well what im getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity
she cant wait too long you know
now theres no reason why you must lose yours
i mean just ponder it a bit thats all
her brow spaghettied what makes you think this watercolorist and i would develop a romantic relationship
i cant be certain that you would
but what have you got to lose
ill try it
i dont see the point in it but ill try it
just for you
its kind of silly actually me going out with an artist in new york city
good good good
youll enjoy it youll see
julian is a gentleman
suddenly the countess swivels in his desk chair and leans forward
lowering his wine glass he focuses directly intensely into sissys blue eyes
his smile widens
by the way sissy
hes a full blooded indian
a title the outhouse radio is playing the starving armenians polka and bonanza jellybean and delores del ruby are in the privy caught in the rain
well im not scared of a little rain
might as well brave it
i dont know about you but im sure not sweet enough to melt
delores flicks her whip at a sweat bee that has taken refuge in the privy and hits the photograph of dale evans upon which it has lit
jelly looks out the door of the outhouse across a cut green lawn to a bunkhouse where we can see a gathering of other cowgirls
there is a fly buzz and a distant polka yip
way off horse lips flutter
bonanza spies a picture of sissy hankshaw an advertisement for yoni yum dew spray mist on the privy wall
if that sissy hankshaw ever shows up here im gonna teach her how to hypnotize a chicken
chickens are the easiest critters on earth to hypnotize
if you can look a chicken in the eyes for tens seconds its yours forever
a meeting is in progression in the bunkhouse that morning
mary is addressing the group
i want to complain that some of the cowgirls have been sleeping two to a bunk again in violation of the agreement that crimes against nature are to be confined
to the hayloft
i dont care who lay with whom or where or how but the moaners groaners and screamers ought to turn down their volume when others are trying to sleep or
some of the younger cowgirls blush
i want to complain about the food around here
its rotten to the core
a round of support from the other cowgirls in the form of cattle calls
jelly and delores are getting ready to run through the rain when all of a sudden jelly spies a barefoot cowgirl its debbie run across the yard in her karate
robe jump on the exercycle that is rusting in the weeds and begin pumping the pedals furiously in the yammering rain
my sacred crocodile
but in a minute others follow debbie everyone of them in fact the entire bunkhouse load of them some thirty young cowgirls squealing giggling they slide and roll on the
wet grass push each other into the mud that is forming by the corral fence chase one another in and out of the thick folds of rain draperies stamp their cute feet in puddles and do bellyflops into the overflowing horse trough
the cowgirls frolic until as suddenly as it has come the rain goes away
they are panting like puppies as they lean against one another or pick clods of mud from one anothers hair
i move that the meeting be adjourned
at the end of the endless game there is friendship
what the heck did she mean by that
just that in heaven all business is conducted this way
in the lobby the doors of an elevator open revealing sissy inside wearing a buttoned up dress
very formal looking for her
there is julian standing in the lobby
he turns and walks toward sissy
he is wearing a rather formal looking plaid sport coat with blue cummerbund
he extends his hand to meet her and perhaps at the sight of sissys thumbs julian has an asthma attack doubling over in front of her
sissy doesnt know whether to assist julian or flee
from the other side of the lobby two well groomed couples white mid thirties and upper middle class come to the rescue
the younger of the men rupert takes charge
he breaks an inhaler of dinephrine under julians nose
wed better take you home
in the red of embarrassment julian looks more indian than he had previously
wheezing he speaks i beg your pardon
ive been enthralled with your photographs for years
when the countess hinted that you might like to meet me he never explained why i was ready to paint for him free of charge
and now i had to go and spoil it
rupert is helping julian to the street
rupert is a salesman for a publishing house
his wife carla a homemaker as they say
the other couple breaks down into howard and marie barth both copywriters for an ad agency
howard hails a cab and carla and marie flutter around sissy
this is dreadful
lowering her voice confidentially you know asthma attacks are brought on by emotional stress
poor julian is so high strung
the excitement of meeting you my dear you look so stunning
must have upset his chemical balance
everyone is piling into the taxi
come on sissy dont be afraid of us
ive never ridden in a cab
the whole idea of paying for a ride makes my thumbs hurt
sissy is forced to suffer the indignity of riding in a vehicle she wasnt responsible for flagging with her own thumbs
itll be all right dear
it isnt as serious as it sounds
carla starts to pat sissys hand then decides to leave the thumbs to themselves
the six of them are squeezed into the taxi
sissy looks out the window of the taxi sissys view as the taxi stops at a light she can see a newsstand headline on the front page of the new
york daily news the taxi stops in front of julians building
it discharges its passengers
inside howard mixes scotch and sodas rupert fills a syringe from a vial of aminophylline he has taken from its place behind a gelatin salad mold in the refrigerator
he gives julian an injection
there that ought to beat them bronchial buggers into submission
he turns to sissy
i was a medic in the army
i really should have become a doctor
sometimes though i feel that pushing books is a whole lot like pushing medicine
think of books as pills
i have pills that cure ignorance and pills that cure boredom
i have pills to elevate moods and pills to open peoples eyes to the awful truth
too bad you dont have a pill for bullshit
carla smiles as if she were joking but shed said it tartly
rupert glares and takes a big bite of scotch
changing the subject where do you live miss hankshaw
im staying with the countess
i know but where do you reside when you arent visiting new york
well no i dont reside anywhere in particular
i just keep moving
everyone looks a bit astonished including the recumbent julian
a traveler eh
you might say that although i dont think of it as traveling
how do you think of it
rupert bites into his scotch again
julian issues a watery wheeze
rupert before you get too engrossed in your research on scotch as a cure for aging dont you think youd better phone elaines and cancel our dinner reservations
sissy leaves her chair and wanders about the apartment
which is full of books and shelves
what would we do without you carla
without our little efficiency expert carla everything would just go to hell
carla is thinking about running for mayor next year arent you carla
up yours herr doktor book salesman
will the demands of your medical practice allow you to call elaines or shall i
oh let me do it
sissy is intrigued by an antique here and an object dart there but she knows she is in an alien environment
sissy enters a bedroom there is a covered birdcage
she sits upon the bed listening for a cheep from the birds
and gradually she reclines
then turning her head to the side against the bedspread no indian blankets
no indian blankets
and she blacks out
and the sound drifts away in waves so there is only the whistle of a distant wind through the mortar of the apartment building
until one by one we see button necks freed
soon sissy can feel it
someone is undressing her
in a voice webby with sleep she lifts her head up and sees howard and marie
where are the others
oh rupert and carla had a little hassle and went home
julian fell asleep on the couch we covered him up
we thought that we should make you comfortable too
sissy thinks this is nice but wonders however why they are both in their underwear
between the two of them they have gotten sissy out of her dress in no time
sissy feels she should apologize for not having on a brassiere
marie slips out of her own brassiere and moves her bare bosom close to sissys
mine are fuller but yours are more perfectly shaped
ill wager theyre the exact same size
howard cups his left hand about a marie breast and his right about one of sissys
he weighs them in his palms squeezes them the way an honest grocer squeezes excess water from a lettuce and spreads his fingers to sample their circumference
yours are larger marie but miss hankshaws sissys are more firm
youd think they would have started to droop i mean from not wearing a bra
watch your manners
youve made her blush
here sissy let me compare
marie seizes sissys free breast quickly like a monkey picking a fruit rolling it about in her hungry little finger rubbing it against her chin and cheeks
it was like her earlier days as a hitchhiker
in ecstasy this place is finer than the place i live
like a disc jockey from paradise howard flips marie over and plays her b side
every now and then she reaches for sissy to include her but the laws of physics insist on being obeyed
over and over marie calls sissys name with half closed eyes
the barths are really going at it marie yowling like a cat
the poodle in the kitchen begins to growl
so this is what its like
so this is what its really like
sissy bounces out of the bed and patters through the living room and crawls under the cover with julian
julian stirs awake
i am sorry about all the fuss
julian and sissy embrace and go at it under the covers but suddenly julian stops after a brief climax
with downcast eyes i apologize
sissy cradles julian and comforts him
it is the measure of western civilization that it can encompass in harmony balance off as it were such divergent masterworks as a midsummer nights dream and the american dream
as the dome of the sistine chapel and the ceiling of the paris opera
sissy sits up her eyes moping about the apartment looking but not seeing the macrame wallhangings the volumes of robert frost
whats the matter
after a while sissy answers
ill turn down the air conditioner
its not the air conditioner thats making me cold
nothing moves in here
not even your birds
sissy gets out of bed and begins to dress
what are you doing
ive got to go
but i dont want you to leave
we can go to dinner
i owe you a dinner
really make love
i have to go julian
why do you have to go
somewhat frantic my thumbs hurt
ive made a mistake
ive been negligent
i havent exercised
i have to hitchhike a little bit every day no matter what
its like a musician practicing his scales
when i dont practice my timing gets off my thumbs get stiff and sore
sissy trembles while she kisses her thumbs
i will hitch with you out where tall birds wade in a lake named for my siwash kin
out where smokey the bear lay down his shovel to romp with more playful beasts
out where starlight has no enemies and the badland wind no friends
out where the boogie stops and the woogie begins
and sissy is now traveling in a truck passing fourteenth street on her way to the geo
view of that bridge as the truck crosses it to new jersy
view of the wilds of new jersey as sissy travels to the west
the countess is on the phone
so she left town
well that shouldnt surprise you
leaving town is what sissy is all about
but tell me how did she strike you
julian is on the other end of the phone
shes obviously that
which would you rather have a million dollars or one of sissys thumbs full of pennies
im not talking about her hands
theyre difficult to ignore i confess but im speaking of her whole being
her whole being is extraordinary
the way she talks for example
shes so articulate
its high time you realized honey babe that a woman doesnt have to give the best years of her life to radcliffe or smith in order to speak the english
im really in a dither
shes turned my head
ninety degrees to the left i hope
how does she feel about you
i think shes disappointed that im not more ah sort of atavistic
shes got some naive sentimental notions about indians
im sure she liked me though but
then she left town
she always leaves town you dummy
that doesnt mean anything
what about in bed
how does she like it in bed
julian pauses for a very long moment
how does she like what in bed
the countess teeth chatter in his mouth
what do you think
shit o dear julian
do you mean to tell me you didnt get it on
oh we didnt get it all the way on
whose fault was that
i suppose it was mine
yes it definitely was my fault
what do they do to you boys in those ivy league schools anyway
strap you down and pump the nature out of you
they can even press the last drop of nature out of a mohawk buck
why send a shaman or cannibal to yale for four years and all hed be fit for would be a desk in the military industrial complex and a seat in
the third row at a neil simon comedy
if harvard or princeton could get hold of the chink for a couple of semesters theyd turn him into a candidate for the bow tie wing of the hall of
if we ivy leaguers arent earthy enough to suit you hillbillies at least we dont go around indulging in racist terms such as chink
next thing i know youll be calling me chief
chinks the guys name for christs sake
aw hes some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out west
gives my ranch the creeps and the willies too
but though he be old and dirty hes alive ill bet clear down to his toes
they dont have his juice in a jar in new haven
well i suppose that ill have to write sissy out on the road
sissy makes little puffs of dust as she walks
from the direction of the ranch a vw microbus is approaching
it is painted with mandalas lamaistic dorjes and symbols representing the clear light of the void
when the microbus draws alongside sissy it stops
inside are two men and a woman
they are approximately twenty four years old
are you a pilgrim
no im more of an indian the trio doesnt smile
she means are you going to see the chink
oh i may and i may not
but seeing him is not my main objective out here
because he wont see you
we came all the way from minneapolis to see him and the crazy bastard tried to stone us to death yeah but i no longer believe that guys a master
hes just a dirty uptight old mountain man
why he pulled out his pecker and shook it at barbara
id stay away from there if i were you lady
sissy walks on leaving the people in the bus arguing about whether the chinks rock shower and pecker wag actually had been intended as spiritual messages
walking down the long dirt road sissy stops to take a breather and sits down on a log
sissy thinking and looking into the clouds
waves of grasses whisper her name ssssssssss sssssssssssss sisssy
meadowlarks squander their songs on her as she begins to squirm on the log
a lincoln continental drives up suddenly
sissy barely has time to zip up
the cadillac stops in front of sissy
a teenaged girl in a stetson is at the wheel
the rear door of the limousine opens and a refined matronly voice calls from the void
by any chance are you sissy hankshaw
yes i am
a chic middle aged woman leans out of the car
why didnt you telephone
someone would have driven into mottburg to pick you up
im miss adrian
from the ranch
the countess wrote that i should expect you
get in wont you
you must be exhausted
gloria assist miss hankshaw with her luggage
gloria nods at sissy amicably but doesnt make a move to help her
sissy swings her sack into the roomy vehicle
before she gets in she flashes her thumb to hitch a ride
the instant that sissy shuts the door the cowgirl chauffeur floors the cadillac and it lurches away in a puff of dust
sitting up after the bothersome lurch of the car
turns to sissy you really ought to have phoned
we were just in mottburg escorting some guests to the afternoon train
sighs more guests leaving ahead of schedule
three checked out today
they decided to transfer to elizabeth ardens maine chance spa in phoenix arizona
it costs two hundred and fifty dollars a week less at the rubber rose so why are our guests leaving and going to elizabeth ardens
miss adrian pushes a button that sends a partition glass between her and the cowgirl driver
gloria starts laughing silently on the other side of the glass
ill tell you why its that plague of cowgirls
theyve gradually infiltrated every sector of our program
the one named debbie considers herself an expert on exercising and diet
with bonanza jellybeans permission and against my explicit orders shes been coercing the guests into trying something called kundalini yoga
do you know what that is
its trying to mentally force a serpent of fire to crawl up your spinal column
miss hankshaw our guests cant comprehend kundalini yoga let alone do it
yesterday she ordered a new cookbook by a tibetan negro entitled third eye in the kitchen himalayan soul food
god knows what that will be like
the little barbarians are destroying everything that ive built mocking all that the company stands for
and theres a new one one they call del ruby
she has the good will of a scorpion
ive considered it prudent to avoid a confrontation that might further upset the guests
but now that the season is practically over we operate april through september and the countess is finally coming
the limousine pulls up in the drive
our ranch has all the latest in modern facilities
we see women having facials
we have a facial wing and next to that is the hair barn
sissy is being given a tour by miss adrian
a variety of hairdos are witnessed
we have a team of fifteen hair experts from all over the world
and fanny flab flies off in this room at the rate of six hundred and seventy five pounds a day
thats a lot of salted ham sissy
sissy and miss adrian walk through the lodge lobby guests and cowgirls are conducting a variety of activities a bird expert projects slides of whooping cranes on the wall and
is giving a lecture about the habits of the birds
in the center of the room cowgirl debbie is leading a mixture of cowgirls and guests in a meditative chant as they reach high above their heads in a yoga
miss adrian stops in front of the registration desk and sissy catches glimpses of the chaotic lobby
our special guest miss sissy hankshaw is with us
the receptionist hands miss adrian a key to sissys room
a cowgirl makes a face at sissy as she walks by carrying a tray of herbal teas
a representative of the film crew is being intimidated by a cowgirl who is looking though his camera lenses and shaking them and listening to them like you would put
a shell up to your ear to hear the ocean
were going to make a movie
another cowgirl big red is lifting a piece of furniture and passes it to her accomplice
get rid of the furniture
its too masculine
get rid of all the furniture and use it for kindling
break away from these pig like chauvinist masculine influences
miss adrian looks on helplessly
she grabs sissy and leads her out of the lobby
miss adrian and sissy walk out the back door of the ranch and out near a corral to the sound of gunfire
o merciful jesus
theyre murdering the guests
one of the film crew members is hanging out in the corral wearing a shiny jacket with disney printed on the back
miss adrian grabs him by the shoulders and shakes him
where are the guests
take it easy lady
they went on a short ride with the cowgirls
rode over the hill yonder
youre miss adrian arent you
we need to talk to you about the filming
not now you fool not now
those crazed bitches have led innocent women out and are slaughtering them at this moment
well all be killed
another cameraman spits out a wad of chewing gum
theres a slaughter going on all right but its not the fat ladies that are getting it
your hired hands are killing the cattle
theyre killing the cows
all of them
interrupted while putting a zoom lens on his camera thats what they said miss adrian
a devilish young cowgirl is sitting on a fence nearby
miss adrian addresses her
how dare you slaughter the countesss cattle
what is a ranch without cows
were going to replace them with goats
most of the cattle are diseased and in pain
were just putting them out of their misery
according to bon an za jellybean the rubber rose is in di cat ive of the countesss values
he has purchased a cheap weak strain of cow to begin with and with improper care
i dont want to hear what bonanza jellybean has been telling you girls
come on sissy
ill show you to your quarters
the chink with his back to us looks down on the ranch from the ridge and watches miss adrian lead sissy into a small guest cottage on the ranch
sissy stirs in a nicely appointed guest cottage
a maid knocks on the door and serves sissy breakfast in bed
excuse me miss
do you care for your breakfast now
sissy sits up and rubs her eyes
i feel a bit hungry
the maid puts the tray down and the cloth that covers the food is lifted away to reveal a shocking display of grease and calories
a vase of prairie asters stands over a double meat cheeseburger a package of hostess twinkies a cold can of dr
pepper and a three musketeers bar
sissy is delighted
how did you know
well it is a change of our usual grapefruit and melba toast im sure
sissy notices a card
it reads compliments of bonanza jellybean bonanza jellybean
she will be up to see you directly
sissy devours her meal
out her window she can see women on exercycles women doing jumping jacks and women in beauty parlors
a fist pounds on sissys door
in sails jelly a cowgirl so cute she makes sissy blush just to look at her
she wears a tan stetson with an aster pinned to it a green satin shirt embroidered with rearing stallions snorting orange fire from their nostrils
her breasts bounce like dinner rolls that have gotten loaded on helium and between red tinged cheeks where more baby fat is taking its time maturing she has a little
smile that can cause minerals and plastics to remember their ancient animate connections
jelly grasps sissys elbow and sits on the side of the bed
by god its great to have you here
its an honor
sorry i took so long getting to you but weve had a mess of hard work these past few days and a heap of planning to do
er you seem to know who i am and maybe even what i am
thanks for the breakfast
oh i know about sissy hankshaw all right
ive done a little hitchhiking myself
ah shucks thats like telling annie oakley youre a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone
id heard tales about you from people id meet in jail cells and truckstops
i heard about your uh your ah your wonderful thumbs and i heard how you were jack kerouacs girl friend
sissy sets her tray on the bedside table
no im afraid that part isnt true
jack was in awe of me and tracked me down
we spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field but he was hardly my lover
besides i always travel alone
well that doesnt matter that part never interested me anyway
the beatnicks were before my time and i never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope cliches and the clap
but the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl
the guests are huffing and puffing in between the pauses in conversation in the background through the window in sissys room
tell me about it
about being a cowgirl
whats it all about
when you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl
cowgirls exist as an image
a fairly common image
the idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture
therefore it seems to me the existence of cowgirls should prevail
otherwise theyre being fooled
in the rodeo hall of fame in oklahoma city there are just two cowgirls
and both of em are trick riders
trick riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos
our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks
thats what prostitutes call it you know tricking
jelly lays her hand atop the oval mound sissys thumb makes under the covers
youre political then
theres girls on the rubber rose who are political but i dont share their views
i got no cowgirl ideology to expound
politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it
there is a moment when the two girls feel something between each other
did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth
its not original
its something i picked up from the chink
the chink huh
ive gathered that you sometimes speak with him
what else have you learned from the chink
learned from the chink
thats hard to say
uh a lot of his talk is pretty goofy
oh yeah now that i think of it the chink taught me something about cowgirls
did you realize that cowgirls have been around for many centuries
long before america
in ancient india the care of the cattle was always left up to young women they called gopis
being alone with the cows all the time the gopis got awfully horny just like we do here
every gopi was in love with krishna a good looking young god who played the flute like it was going out of style when the moon was full this krishna
would play his flute by a river and call the gopis to him
then he would multiply himself sixteen thousand times one for each gopi and make love to each one the way she most desired
there they were sixteen thousand gopis balling krishna on the river bank and the energy of their merging was so great that it created a huge oneness a total union
of love and it was god
quite a picture huh
sissys thumb twitches
jelly swallows hard
they gaze into each others eyes
a whistle pierces the sunlight outside the window
that couldnt be krishna could it
a bit shrill for a flute
just our rotten luck
jelly walks to the window and exchanges hand signals with someone outside
gotta run now
delores says im needed
maybe its the countess
jelly spins her six shooter in her kewpie fingers
sissy cowgirl history is about to be made
im damn glad youre here to witness it
she holsters her gun and blows sissy a kiss then is gone out the door
sissy hops out of bed and from the window she can see cowgirls gathering in a circle
someone or something is in the center of the circle
sissy zips herself into a red jumpsuit and hurries outside
what was in the center of the circle was a goat
debbie was scratching the animals ears
she was hugging it
way cuter than a cow
goats are always testing you
theyre like zen masters
they can tell instantly if youre faking your feelings
so they play games with you to keep you true
people should go to goats instead of psychiatrists
its so loving
gloria cuts in on debbie and gives the beast a hug
look at those playfully wise eyes
it licked me
more and more people are discovering that cows milk isnt fit for human consumption
billy west says if we can produce enough goats milk on the ranch to make it worth his while hell run it into fargo regularly
she pauses and looks around the group in the circle
im aware that tad lucas rode broncs until her ninth month but i dont think pregnant cowgirls are going to be any asset on this ranch
i hope you itchy clits who are sneaking down to the lake every night are taking precautions
its bad enough weve got cranes coming we dont need storks
i feel that those film makers should be removed from the rubber rose as soon as possible
men can cause nothing but trouble here
i also feel that our guest she nods at sissy should be excused while we discuss this matter further
hurt sissy leaves the group
views of sissy in her whooping crane outfit dancing to debussy in front of the disney film crew
the documentary being directed by an effusive frenchman
view of the camera crew training their long telephoto lenses on siwash lake
they all seem to be wearing the same trademark satin baseball jackets with one logo or another on their backs
another view of the lake from above from the chinks point of view and our first view of the chink
the chink spies sissy and jelly coming over a ridge
we cannot hear them at first but sissy and jelly are talking
delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week but so far her third vision hasnt happened
niwetukame the mother goddess has not gotten back in touch with her
meanwhile she and debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools
what a drag
what is debbies position
debbie says that if women are to take charge again they must do it in the feminine way they mustnt resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods
she says it is up to women to show themselves better than men to love men set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the new age
shes a real dreamer that debbie dear
you dont agree with debbie then
i wouldnt say that
i expect shes right ultimately
but im with delores when it comes to fighting for whats mine
i cant understand why delores is so uptight about the chink he could probably teach her a thing or two
that grass tickles doesnt it
god knows i love women but nothing can take the place of a man that fits
still this is cowgirl territory and ill stand with delores and fight any bastards who might deny it
i guess ive always been a scrapper
only twelve years old and i was felled by a silver bullet
jelly takes sissys hand carefully avoiding the thumbs and helps her feel the depression in her belly
the depression is a dimple like another navel
after a hungry stillness like intermission at a wolf dance rhythms are established
jelly and sissy are socked into one another now and they arch and push and corkscrew and jackknife softly but with pronounced cadence
everything becomes scrambled
they rock each other in cradles of sweat and saliva until we can see nothing
noisy breaths buck out of sissy jelly jelly but she cant hear sissy because she is screaming
hysterical from the scalding hot softness of girl love
the chink looks on from the hilltop above indifferently
sissy and jelly are riding on the back of a horse
a whooping crane is spied by sissy as she rides on the back of jellybeans horse back to the ranch
delores and big red hurry to meet them
sure enough across the yard in the midst of the low cal barbecue in progress monocle reflecting sunlight cigarette holder stabbing the air stands the countess
look at him
perverse as a pink pickle
sick as a vice squad
hes in a snit
he wants to see you right after the barbecue
jellybean chuckles sardonically and dismounts
get the girls
hes gonna see me right now
sissy confused and loyalties torn in the face of an impending revolution leaves the corral and entering her room she locks herself in
as she locks the latch she hears jellys voice
jelly has taken over the ranch loudspeaker system and is giving an ultimatum
any of you ladies who would like to join us youre welcome to stay on as a full working podner at the rubber rose
rest of you get packed and i mean now
youve got fifteen minutes to move your lard asses off this ranch
women are reacting to the demands
some women are taking up trowels and brooms as weapons
the help is joining the revolt
other women are running for their lives
she hears the screen door screech open and a chaos of footsteps in the hall
she goes to her window
and she can see partially cut off by the corner of the building miss adrian screaming
you will all be rounded up and sent to prison if you take this any farther
this is not your ranch
the countess seems to be taking it slowly and calmly smoking a french cigarette
he observes the fighting among them with amusement
you pathetic little cutesy poos
do you actually suppose this exhibition of childlike melodrama is advancing the cause of freedom
you owe us this here ranch as a token payment for your disgusting exploitations tranquilly then take it
go for it girls
the hands who carry axes picks pitchforks and shovels retreat
the countess still grinning reaches for an hors doeuvre and subjects his cigarette to a measured self assured puff
shaking her fist go to your bunkhouse and remain there
the guests are hurriedly packing their things
she looks on
when the revolutionaries have retreated about thirty yards they stop
with astonishing rapidity they unbuckle unbutton and unzip and step out of their jeans and underpants
then nude from the waist down thatched pubises thrust forward up front and leading the way they begin to advance
the countesss grin goes down his throat like bathwater down a drain
better reach for your spray cans
not one of these pussies has been washed in a week
rather pale his nose twitching the countess drops the caviar canape he has been holding
on come the cowgirls pelvises pumping laying down what the trembling countess believes to be a devastating barrage of musk
miss adrian lost in her own hysteria charges
a barbeque fork she hurls draws blood from heathers eyebrow
quick as a frogs tongue deloress whip cracks
its lash curls around the ranch managers ankles pulling her feet from under her
she hits the sod in a jangle of jewelry and expulsion of breath
a molotov cocktail thrown by big red says hello to the sexual reconditioning building
within seconds the structure is blazing
the bare assed cowgirls storm into the beauty parlor and exercise rooms
sounds of breaking glass and wood splintering
the air is singing with cries of wahoo yippee let er buck and the vagina is a self cleaning organ
sissy flees the house as she hunkers down out the back door
sissy running across it
she passes the pool and falls in
climbing out wet scared she runs to the base of siwash ridge and southward along the mountains foot
eventually sissy comes to a place where the juniper bushes are broken to reveal a crude path beginning a steep ascent
sissy decides to climb up it
she shoulders her way through low slivery boughs
approximately halfway up the ridge she rests on a flat rock from which she can look down on the
burning rubber rose smoking away distant yahoos and carryings on can be heard
horses whinney in the corral
a few gunshots are thrown into the soundtrack if things arent lively enough
miss adrians cadillac on fire roars out of the drive
sissy looks up to the quiet mountain
then she looks back to the chaos below
van drive away
sissy sits and wonders
the sun is setting on the horizon mixing well with the firelight that the rubber rose is giving off
but she is aware of something watching her
looking about she sees nothing
view of an empty trail
view of a quivering bush
sissy turns to the sound of the chink
ha ha ho ho hee hee
and there he is
standing only ten yards away
the chinks problem is that he looks like he rolled out of a zen scroll as if he says presto a lot knows the meaning of lightning and the origin
he looks as if he drinks dew and fucks snakes
sissy and the chink scrutinize one another with mutual fascination
ha ha ho ho and hee hee
sissy is just about to speak but before she does the chink whirls and scampers up the mountainside
warily he stops and turns poised to flee again
she raises her ripe right thumb
and jerking it and swooshing it she hitchhikes the chink and his mountain
there he stands where sissys thumbs have stopped him
the chink wears the wary look of a wild animal
hes not going to stay stopped long
it is sissys move
well arent you going to shake your whanger at me
the chink pauses for a moment then he slaps his thighs and giggles hysterically
ha has ho hos and hee hees squirt out of his nose and through the gaps in his teeth
laughter dies a nervous chipmunk death follow me
ill fix you supper
the two doggedly walk up the steep trail
im a friend of bonanza jellybeans
i know who you are
well theres been some trouble on the ranch
i came up here to get out of the way
its so dark now i doubt if i could find my way back down
if you could help
voice that wears no pants save your breath for the climb
sissy takes another look at the rubber rose which is now quiet
we can hear faintly a distant popping of washcloths and girlish laughter
they make their way into a depression at the top of the mountain down a ladder of sticks
the chink lights a large fire in the middle of the depression
he puts a kettle of stew over the fire and begins to roast yams
the chinks face as the fire dances off it
a can of chung king water chestnuts is opened
cut to sissy and the chink eating supper on a rough wooden bench
and as they finish the chink goes into a cave and returns with a tiny peppermint stripped plastic transistor radio
he switches it on and the silence is broken by the happy hour polka
still clutching the radio in one hand the chink hops into the wheel of firelight and begins to dance
sissy walks around the fire watching the old geezer heel and toe skip and hop
he flings his bones he flings his beard
ha ha ho ho and hee hee
arms swimming feet firecrackering he dances and dances
when the song ends the chink puts the radio down as the news comes on
personally i prefer stevie wonder but what the hell
those cowgirls are always bitching because the only radio station in the area plays nothing but polkas but i say you can dance to anything if you really feel like
the chink dances a little to the news and then lifts sissy by her shoulders and guides her onto his pock marked dance floor
but i dont know how to polka
neither do i
ha ha ho ho hee hee
the radio strikes up the lawrence welk is a hero of the republic polka and the chink and sissy dance arm in arm their shadows reel against the curves of
the depression in the mountain
night birds fly past with fluttering feathers
a bat flies out of the cave
the chink escorts sissy to a dark side of the depression and sits her down upon a pile of soft stuff dried wheatgrass faded indian blankets and old down pillows
thinking so this is how jelly spends her visits to the chink
a twanging noise sounds from the bowels of the nearby cave
what was that
the chink pauses to decide whether he should talk any further then proceeds
the clockworks is one reason that i am here on siwash ridge
i accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the clock people
he was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far
away siwash ridge
i came to the dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own
sissy cradles her head in her arms but is startled by a louder noise from the clockworks
the chink is startled too
sounds the cave and then it chimes poing
the chink smiles at the noise coming from his clockworks
but unlike the clockworks of the clock people my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe
he listens ha ha ho ho and hee hee
the clock people
the chink leads sissy into the cave where we see his clockworks
it is made of garbage can lids and old saucepans and lard tins and car fenders all wired together with baling wire
a bat flies into it making a bong noise and the contraption moves a little
during the second world war i busted out of tule lake detention camp as a japanese american i had been put there and watched over
i found refuge with the clock people who discovered me in a snow bank near dead i had been climbing across the sierra nevada mountains
then if you are japanese then why are you called the chink
the clock people mistook me for chinese
and the name stuck
in the same way that all indian tribes came to be labeled indians through the ignorance of an italian sailor with a taste for oranges it is only fitting that
indians misnamed me
the clock people however are not a tribe rather they are a gathering of indians from various tribes
they have lived together since
a gathering of the clock people
a woman is giving birth near the giant timekeeping hourglass
the pivotal function of the clock people is the keeping and observing of the clockworks
it is a real thing and is kept at the center at the soul of the great burrow
insofar as it is possible all clock people deaths and births occur in the presence of the clockworks
aside from birthing or dying the reason for the daily visits to the clockworks is to check the time
sissy listens to the chink as they walk around the chinks clockworks
these people have no other ritual than this one
likewise they have but one legend or cultural myth that of a continuum they call the eternity of joy
it is into the eternity of joy that they believe all men will pass once the clockworks is destroyed
the destruction must come from the outside must come by natural means must come at the will of this gesticulating planet whose more acute stirrings thoughtless people call earthquakes
the chink holds sissys thumbs in his hands adoringly
the earth is alive
she burns inside with the heat of cosmic longing
she longs to be with her husband again
she turns softly in her sleep
in the eternity of joy pluralized deurbanized man at ease with his gentle technologies will smile and sigh when the earth begins to shake
i loved those loony redskins but i couldnt be a party to their utopian dreaming
after a while it occurred to me that the clock people waiting for the eternity of joy was virtually identical to the christians waiting for the second coming
or the communists waiting for the worldwide revolution
or the debbies waiting for the flying saucers
all the same
just more suckers betting their share of the present on the future banking every misery on a happy ending to history
well history is ending every second happily for some of us unhappily for others happily one second unhappily the next
history is always ending and always not ending
ha ha ho ho and hee hee
sissy interrupts the chink for a second while he is worshipping her thumbs
what do you believe in then
ha ha ho ho and hee hee
then he says nothing
and his silence makes sissy weep
they sit down on a grass floor illuminated by the fire outside the cave
then the chink without hesitation grasps her thumbs
he squeezes them caresses them covers them with wet kisses telling them how beautiful they are
sissy is bowled over frightened stunned elated moved almost to tears
sissy bends her head back and whispers
if this be adultery make the most of it
and as the chink plunges into sissy she arches her spread bottom against the blankets and rears up to meet him halfway
their bodies glowing in the firelight they cast shadows of ancient beings anthropomorphs making love through the night under the moon
sunbeams awaken sissy
when she looks around she sees an inscription has been freshly scrawled on the right wall
and on the left wall sissy hears and then sees a helicopter in the sky above the ranch
sissy gets up and walks out of the cave
sissy hitches a ride out of town
countless newspapers on countless porches and the headline of the st
louis post dispatch reads the countess is in a snit
sissy dont play dumb with me
youre a good model but a shitty actress
the cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance
you know perfectly well they are
last seen in nebraska
didnt make it to canada
siwash lake is between nebraska and canada
the cowgirls have possession of siwash lake
and who else but jellybeans wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds
how much do you know about it
have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows
i dont know anything about it
youre trying to protect those scuzzy bitches
well let your conscience be your guide as my mommy used to say but it wont work
those stinking sluts are going to suffer
sissy strikes the countess with her right thumb with astonishing force
immediately the thumb strikes again this time shattering the countesss monocle against his eye
gasping shit o dear
his dentures fall onto the shag rug
the left thumb strikes
sissy is swinging her thumbs like ballbats socking flaming homers over the left field fence
the countess is out on his feet
his eyes are closed
his legs wobble
he does a pathetic dance like a drunken old fool trying to boogie with a chorus girl
he topples forward and meets sissys onrushing thumb of thunder which straightens him up sends him over backward
motionless he lies on the floor a crimson part in his thinning hair a bright ooze at each nostril
seated on a spotless wooden bench is sissy staring at a clock
a surgeon emerges
well hes not out of danger but i think we can safely say hes going to make it
id be pretty surprised if he didnt
however there is evidence of injury to the frontal lobe and i have reason to fear that this injury may be permanent
the patient may never again function as a normal human being
you mean hes going to be a vegetable
i wouldnt say that no
we wont ascertain the extent of the injury for some days
but there is a genuine possibility of severe and lasting behavioral defects
i wouldnt classify it in the vegetable category however
a conservative blue econoline van out of the throngs of traffic draws itself to sissy as if on a string
the driver stomps on the gas
with a sense of disgust at her own failure sissy scrutinizes his sweaty brow his smug hot leer his starving eyes
her heart sinks when she sees his gun and his knife
he is also unzipping his pants
im going to give it to you like youve never had it before
oh you didnt know it could be this good
youre gonna like it
youre gonna like it
youre gonna like it so good
youre gonna love it so much youre gonna cry
youre gonna cry
youre gonna cry and cry
do you like to cry
do you like it when it hurts a little bit
whatever happens to you itll be worth it
the way im gonna give it to you itll be worth anything
go ahead and cry if you want to
i like it when women cry
it means they appreciate me
the van pulls over down a dead end alley between warehouses
sissy looks into the back at a soiled mattress
the driver is taking his dick out of his pants
but with a swift swoosh sissys left thumb comes down hard on the penis top making the driver howl
his finger fumbles for the gun trigger but before he gets to it sissys thumb splats between his eyes
he loses control of the van
it lumbers into a street lamp
sissy leaps from the vehicle and runs
sissy goes in and begins to cry at the counter as she looks at her thumbs
into a sunset hitches sissy
sissy hops into a semi
then an older dr
dreyfus answers the door
without sissys asking he speaks
im afraid i cant help you
please child dont be dismayed
we all have problems these days
but as the painter van gogh said mysteries remain sorrow or melancholy remains but the everlasting negative is balanced by the positive work which thus is achieved after all
i dont suppose that means very much to you
i have retired
a victim of a malpractice suit
embracing him oh doctor
youve got to do it
you and nobody else should be allowed to take away my gift
in her embrace the doctor is presented with her thumbs
ah the thumb
later sitting inside his study dreyfus muses
the thumb the thumb the thumb the thumb the thumb the thumb
one of evolutions most ingenious inventions a built in tool sensitive to texture contour and temperature an alchemical lever the secret key to technology the link between the mind and
art a humanizing device
the marmoset and the lemur are thumbless none of the new world monkeys has opposable thumbs the spider monkeys thumbs are absent or reduced to a tiny tubercle the thumbs
of the potto are set at an angle of one hundred eighty degrees to the other digits
and so you are demanding at last the privileges of thumb that nature has perversely denied you
i just want to be normal give me that old fashioned normality
it was good enough for crazy horse and its good enough for me
very well my dear
here is what we can do
views of sissy admitted to a hospital blood analyzed in a laboratory
powerful lamps turn on in an operating room
iv tubes are inserted in veins
sissy is wheeled into surgery
an anesthesiologist sticks a needle into a curved and creamy ass
an anesthesiologist sticks needles into a long graceful neck
a nurse scrubs an arm
a body and table are draped with sheets to create a sterile field
a tourniquet is placed on a slender right arm
an elastic rubber bandage is applied so tightly it squeezes most of the blood out of an arm
a tourniquet is inflated
a surgeon outlines in iodine an incision around the base of a thumb
pale smooth skin is incised along a premarked line and dissected down to the bone
woman flesh is sewn shut with four ought nylon suture
a tourniquet is deflated a bloody arm bathed
a young woman is rolled into a recovery room
a nurse and two surgeons their attention directed by an intensifying pinkish glow turn to stare into a metal pan where a huge human thumb disarticulated from the hand it
has been severed from is now flopping about like a trout or rather arching and thrusting itself in a calculated and endlessly repeated gesture the gesture of the hitchhike
two representatives of the fish and wildlife service are flying over siwash lake in a u
forestry service helicopter
they can see the whooping cranes by the side of the lake
and as they are recording this shots from a band of young women on horseback drive them away
the same two agents are driving in a truck approaching the rubber rose ranch
two bullet ricochets spin off the hood and roof of their truck and they stop to see a lone teenaged cowgirl with a rifle
an entourage of forest service rangers a county sheriff four deputy shriffs a state game warden and mottburgs town marshall and several of his deputies the editor of the mottburg
gazette and a couple of bird watchers or two are met by
at least fifteen armed females at the gate of the ranch
through a bullhorn jelly speaks out at the entourage of law enforcement officers
yep the whooping cranes are here all right
theyre in fine shape and as you musta saw from your fucking whirly machine unrestrained free to go as they please
but this is private property and you arent laying a foot on it
none of you
well be back with a court order and a fistful of search warrants
just come back with a couple of people who know what theyre doing and well letem in for a nice close look at the birds
and make sure at least one of them is female and you better do as we say or there may be trouble
and over the airwaves an announcement is broadcast
microphone for the news and reading from a paper in his hand
it will be my extreme pleasure to report to the president
who has been gravely concerned about the fate of our whooping cranes
two construction workers high atop the city listening to a small transistor radio and eating lunch
and to the interior secretary and to the american people that the entire flock of cranes is indeed at
a crowd of people listening to a broadcast in front of a bandstand set up in front of the mall
siwash lake and in apparently healthy condition
the crowd cheers
the cranes have built brooding nests around the whole circumference of the small lake and have
cowgirls are watching a small television
hatched chicks there
counting the young birds there are now approximately sixty cranes in the flock
while this is good news it is also quite bewildering
a vehicle know as the peyote wagon pulls out of the rubber rose
delores del ruby is at the wheel
and over her truck radio we hear whooping cranes are territorially minded and have never been known to nest as close as a mile to one another yet here they
are virtually side by side
a lone fbi man sees the peyote wagon leaving the ranch through his binoculars
sissy hears a broadcast over a moving car radio
the rubber rose ranch has issued a communique that was sent to the federal judge and copies of a recording to the press today
we can hear the voice of bonanza jellybean over the radio sissy recognizes the voice
jelly is on the telephone
sissy listens to the radio
sissy is hitchhiking with her new thumb
but cars pass one after another without stopping
until sissy finally tries her left thumb which has been spared the knife
with this thumb there are new maneuvers to try out
and as soon as the does a car stops
mosaic of hitchhiking brilliance with sissys use of her left thumb
a clock is ticking past twelve then on to six and past eight
she dances wildly around traffic stopping the hardest of drivers the clock ticks away and within thirty hours she is approaching mottburg again
the ranch is now surrounded by two hundred federal marshalls reinforced by a dozen fbi agents with loaded guns taking position outside the ranch
sissy gets out of her car and walks past the posse and through the gates
kym carries a radio which is playing the day old apple strudel polka across the corral
she carries the radio as if it is a suitcase full of skunk lice
man this is the stupidest music ive ever heard
this radio should have stayed in the privy where it belongs
kym ropes the radio to her saddle horn and prepares to give it a ride across the dakota hills
she gets on her horse and rides by the ranch bungalows and spies sissy sitting in the outhouse
kym gets off her horse and hugs sissy
you know what youre getting into if you come over to the lake
yes but i want to be there
i want to see jellybean
i want to see the cranes
they ride across the hills
then they stop at an outlook and sissy sees the circular barricade in the field below
we heard on the radio that the judge has set deloress bail at fifty thousand dollars
now she wont be here when we really need her
a few cowgirls in the camp huddle around a radio the american civil liberties union has requested an extension for the rubber rose ranch
the government is aware of the inflamed situation and are afraid that all the marshals and agents might be too willing to uncork the bottle of blood
sissy rides into camp on the back of kyms horse the way that john wayne would have ridden into the alamo heather bonanza jellybean debbie elaine and linda dance up
to meet her
before sissy is completely on the ground jellys tongue is in her mouth
she stumbles out of a stirrup into a wiggly embrace
debbie stokes up a big joint right now as jelly gets out her six guns and fires them in the air
heather twirls and jumps through her rope
the unsung hero returns polka strikes up on the radio
elaine rears up on her horse
from afar an fbi agent views the little going on
aint that just like women
but as the agent is saying this viewing them from the ridge a large rock tumbles down the hill and grazes his head knocking him out
view of the side of the ridge from where the rock came but there is strangely nothing where we expect to see the chink
below the cowgirls
looks like every time we get together things are in a mess
so be it
it looks serious this time though
all these guns
are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes
hell no the cranes are wonderful okay but im not in this for whooping cranes
im in it for cowgirls
if we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue then cowgirls become just another compromise
i want a finer fate than that for me and for every other cowgirl
better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised
how did this business get started anyhow
why are the birds nesting here
you were aware that we were feeding them werent you
we fed them brown rice and they stayed over a couple of extra days
then we decided to try something different
we mixed our brown rice with fishmeal whoopers love seafood and fishmeal is cheap
then delores suggested another ingredient and we think thats what did the trick
aw come off it sissy
what do you mean drugged
every living thing is a chemical composition and anything that is added to it changes that composition
when you eat a cheeseburger or a three musketeers bar it changes your body chemistry
the kind of food you eat the kind of air you breathe can change your mental state
does that mean youre drugged
sissy frames the flock with the hole in the center of her cheese sandwich
no i guess not
drugged is a stupid word
but the peyote is obviously affecting their brains
its made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years
the way i see it is that the peyote mellowed them out
made them less uptight
they were afraid of bad weather and humans
thats why they migrated and kept to themselves
but the peyote has enlightened them
its taught them there is nothing to fear but fear itself
now theyre digging life and letting the bad vibes slide on
dont worry be happy
be here now
fear in wild animals is completely different from paranoia in people
in the wilderness ecosystem fear is natural and necessary
its merely a mechanism for maintaining life
if the cranes hadnt had a capacity for fear they would have disappeared long ago and youd be having to get loaded with common old everyday meadowlarks and mallards
this here discussion is destined to become academic
because weve got less than half a bag of peyote buttons left and deloress run ended up in the mottburg jail
so any day now well get a chance to see how the whoopers behave when they come down to see if the peyote experience really changed them or not
but in the meantime i want to say this about fear
then sissy and jelly hear a news broadcast on the radio
judge greenfield at the request of the aclu has granted a forty eight hour extension of the deadline by which the rubber rose cowgirls must comply with his order
negotiations between the cowgirls and the government are expected to follow
another item in the forewoman of the rubber rose ranch a delores del ruby is now free on bond after having been arrested in mottburg with more than fifty pounds
of peyote buttons
her bail has been paid by the owner of the besieged ranch countess products inc
miss del rubys bail having come from the tycoons personal advisor a certain dr
robbins of new york city
sissy and jelly lie under the same stars under the same blankets
under the same spell
every time i tell you that i love you you flinch
but thats your problem
if i flinch when you say you love me its both our problems
my confusion becomes your confusion
students confuse teachers patients confuse psychiatrists lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts
delores and some of the other cowgirls are talking
a sharp wind is beginning to gust
it isnt for ourselves that we take this stand
it isnt for cowgirls
its for all the daughters everywhere
this is an extremely important confrontation
this is womankinds chance to prove to her enemy that shes willing to fight and die
if we women dont show here and now that we arent afraid to fight and die then our enemy will never take us seriously
men will always know that no matter how strong our words and determined our deeds theres a point where well back down and give them their way
delores cracks her whip then parades around the campfire
im prepared to win
victory for every female living or dead whos suffered the temporary defeats of masculine insensitivity to their inner lives
a few of the cowgirls cheer
ill fight the bastards
big red opens a can of beans with a bowie knife
ill fight em with bean gas if necessary
delores snaps her whip again
the suns going down
lets those of us not standing watch get some sleep
in the morning well plan our fight
tomorrow afternoon those of you whod like can join me in the reeds where the cranes and i will be sharing the last crumbs left in the peyote sack
delores del ruby appears from the reeds at siwash lakes edge asleep yet awake
she has sunk so deep into the hole in her mind that gale and dust could not follow her
many are transfixed as they listen
it is womans mission to destroy as well as to give birth
we will destroy the tyranny of the dull
but we cant destroy it with guns
violence is the dullards breakfast of champions and the logical end product of his or her misplaced pride
violence fertilizes that which we would starve
no we will destroy the enemy in other ways
the peyote mother has promised a fourth vision
but it wont come to me alone
it will come to each of you to every cowgirl in the land when you have overcome that in your own self which is dull
the fourth vision will come to some men too
you will recognize them when you meet them and be their steady sidekicks in equal and ecstatic escapades of poetic behavior and romance
delores holds up a card
the prairie moon illuminates its tattered edges
it is the jack of hearts
the forewoman seems to be tiring
fumes of weariness stream from her black hair
her voice is leaning against the wall of her larynx when she says first thing you must end this business with the government and the cranes
its been positive and fruitful but its gone far enough
playfulness ceases to serve a serious purpose when it takes itself too seriously
sorry i wont be with you at the conclusion
as you know ive been sick and stupid for a long time
i have a lot to make up for a lot to accomplish and theres someone important that ive got to see
as graceful as a ballet for cobras delores turns and walks away into the night
the fbi other vigilantes and policemen wait in anticipation of an attack outside of the boundaries of the ranch
jelly is addressing the group of cowgirls
well what we got to do is one of us has got to go up that hill and tell them boys that america can have its whooping cranes back
since im the boss here and since im responsible for a lot of you choosing to be cowgirls in the first place its gonna be me that goes
small protests from the circle of cowgirls
no buts about it
its getting lighter by the second
you podners keep your heads down
the cutest cowgirl in the world stood up and stretched out
but jelly is already on her way
bonanza jellybean vaults over the carcass of a reducing machine and plants her tony lama boots in the stirrup of her saddle and straddles her horse and takes off
the posse surrounding the ranch can see jelly coming over the hill on her horse at a full gallop
jelly stops her horse looks down at her waist and sees her sixguns
better get rid of these
might give those greenhorn dudes a fright
through the scope of an fbi rifle jelly is drawing her gun out of her holster
shes going to fire
he squeezes the trigger and jelly is caught in the stomach with a bullet
she falls off her horse to the ground
the chink sees bonanza jellybean cut down from a vantage point on the hill and makes a beeline for the government barricades shouting
the cowgirls scream and cry and grab their weapons
a couple of them leap from the barricade and are immediately riddled
the six gun slips from her fingers
twenty or thirty more sweaty triggers are squeezed on the hilltop firing at bonanza jellybean
a voice over the bullhorn directed at the cowgirls echoes youve got two minutes to come out with you hands over your heads
random g men are sniping at the cowgirls making it impossible to surrender
a stray bullet sends the chink back down the hillside beard robe and sandals flying
in the hush that follows in the echoes of the explosive fire the whooping crane flock rises in one grand assault of beating feathers a lily white storm of life
a gush of albino gabriels swarm into the waiting sky and circle the pond one time before flapping south toward texas
they cast shadows over a dead jellybean who is literally biting the dust
sissy lifts jelly out of the dust and holds her
sissy lifts jellys satin shirt tail and pulls down the waistband of her skirt
bright red blood is running out of her scar
right in the scar where i fell on a wooden horse when i was twelve
haw i wasnt really shot with a silver bullet
confessing to sissy
or was i
the cranes fly over the statue of liberty
the cranes fly over the eiffel tower
the cranes fly over red square
an undertaker pounding five nails into a white coffin
on the top of the coffin are engraved two crossed gold sixguns
there are eleven famous cowgirls enameled on the edges and in the middle it reads ha ha ho ho and hee hee title card the brown paper bag
a brown paper bag is sitting on the side of the road
the brown paper bag is the only thing civilized man has produced that does not seem out of place in nature
crumpled into a wad of wrinkles like the fossilized brain of a dryad its kinship to tree to knot and nest unobscured by the cruel crush of industry absorbing the
elements like any other organic entity blending with rock and vegetation as if it were a burrowing owls door mat or a jack rabbits underwear a no
kraft paper bag lay discarded in the hills of dakota and appeared to live where it lay
once long ago it had borne a package of buns and a jar of mustard to a kitchenette rendezvous with a fried hamburger
more recently the bag had held
view of a bunkhouse trunk
as a hole in an oak hides a squirrels family jewels the bag had hidden love letters in the bottom of a bunkhouse trunk
hands lift the contents of the trunk away rope spurs and blanket and find the hidden sack of letters
then one day after work the button nosed little cowgirl to whom the letters were addressed gathered bag and contents under her arm slipped out to the corral
we see the cowgirl saddling her horse late in the day
past ranch hands pitching horseshoes and ranch hands flying tibetan kites saddled up and trotted into the hills
we see the cowgirl riding along a ridge
a mile or so from the bunkhouse she dismounted and built a small fire she fed the fire letters
and this we see also the lonely cowgirl feeding the letters to a fire in the dusky early night
we can see the cowgirl is sissy hankshaw
one by one the way her girl friend had once fed her french fries
she is crying now and feeding the fire close of words like always and forever burning up
as words such as sweetheart and honey britches and forever and always burned away the cowgirl squirted a few tears
her eyes were so misty she forgot to burn the bag
sissy is sobbing
big red offers a piece of homemade fudge and shows no surprise when sissy refuses it
kym kisses the lips quickly of the despondent cowgirl and the bunkhouse lights go out
delores plunks a carefree song on an old gibson looks up at the moon
you know podner you can tune a guitar but you cant tuna fish
she plunks a few notes
god but its good to be a cowgirl
and the bunkhouse lights are turned off
there are some giggles from the cowgirls
the chink wakes up and is being cared for by sissy
he is in pain but winking
is everything getting worse
yes everything is getting worse
but everything is also getting better
the countess has come to our aid
the rubber rose ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls
and i have been asked to oversee the ranch
for a week
and as it turns out the countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was
heres a picture
sissy shows a picture of the countess recovering in a hospital bed posing next to doctor robbins
i want to go back to the clock people
i kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what theyre up to
whats happened to jelly
she had a one way ticket to kansas city
you mean shes dead
the chink mourns a bit
but thats an old story now
i cant believe that you would leave the butte
easy come easy go
wow you sure have a way with words
the chink looks over and sees that delores is standing in the doorway
i cant help it if i grew up in an antipoetic culture
language will be different when im with the clock people though
theyre from an oral tradition
and im not talking about what you horny hop toads do in bed every night
the chink smiles
well if the clock people give you any inside information on the end of the world drop us a postcard
the world isnt going to end you dummy i hope you know that much
he grows uncharacteristically serious but it is going to change
its going to change drastically and probably in your lifetime
the clock people see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change and they may be right since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long
but there are far worse catastrophes coming
unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization in other words unless it can break the consumption habit and we are so conditioned
to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption
it isnt merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes but that our operative political economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us
from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault
so the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan all right but therell be some of us itll miss
little pockets of humanity
like the clock people
like you two honeys if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on siwash cave
theres almost no worldwide calamity famine nuclear accident plague weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield that you couldnt survive in that cave
he begins to caress sissys belly
his eyes are smiling
sissy is surprised
suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics
all in siwash cave
in a postcatastrophe world your offspring would of necessity intermarry forming in time a tribe
a tribe every member of which had giant thumbs
a tribe of big thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways
it could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools
it would have to rely on its wits and its senses
it would have to live with animals and plants
as virtual equals
its extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants learning their languages perhaps and paying them the respect they deserve
how am i going to be the progenitor of a tribe when im living on an isolated ridgetop with delores
thats your problem
the chink coughs
listen to the way im babbling
that bullet must have loosened one of my transistors
dont pay any attention to me
youve got to work it out for yourself
the westbound choo choo leaves mottburg at one forty
i want to be on it
will you drive me to the station
sissy and delores are driving the chink out the front gate of the rubber rose
ironic how i have to follow timetables in order to get back to the clockworks
he yells out the window of the moving vehicle
dont ever bet against paradox ladies
we hear the chink yelling and the rubber rose sign is being changed to one that reads el rancho jellybean
if complexity doesnt beat you then paradox will
ha ha ho ho and hee hee
and the truck disappears into the prairie land
a long dark pause until finally we are inside the cave where the chinks clockworks are at work
it is revealed that sissy is with delores snug in the old hermits living quarters
she listens to the clinking of the chinks clockworks
and feels her belly
the swell of her belly has forced her to sleep on her back
close view of sissys belly and a little foot kicks from inside
or is it a foot
view inside the belly of sissys unborn baby
it is half japanese one thirty second siwash and all thumbs
the moving thumbs are hitchhiking you
