href b b by melvin frank norman krasna and norman panama this is december in the first safe area directly behind the battle line in the italian theatre
in the distance occasional artillery light flashes are seen and artillery rumbles are heard
the battered terrain shows the effects of battle
in the foreground is a recreation area covered with camouflage entertainment is in progress on a raised stage
men of the division are seated about on benches boxes and the ground
a camouflaged motor pool of jeeps and tanks is nearby
we can hear laughter and applause from the men as a jeep with two stars on the front indicating it is the generals car jounces along a road toward the
side of the recreation area
a young sergeant is at the wheel an adjutant beside him and in the rear are general waverly and general carlton
as it jounces along
general waverly is weather beaten and weary his uniform while neat shows the effects of long wear
general carlton on the other hand is stiff clean and fresh from the pentagon
he is staring off at the recreation area
to adjutant whats this all about colonel
turning a little entertainment for the men sir
tonights christmas eve
these men are moving up tonight
they should be lined up for full inspection
the jeep has come to a halt
eyeing him youre absolutely right
to adjutant theres no christmas in the army colonel
waverly and the adjutant alight from the jeep
to carlton theres always a slip up or two during a change in command
the men get a little loose
but i know im leaving them in good hands
stiffly thank you
to driver sergeant take me to headquarters immediately
well have those men turned out on the double
the sergeant looks at general waverly
take the short cut
the jeep pulls off and makes a half circle
the adjutant makes a gesture as if to stop it
the general stops him
the adjutant turns to him
thats not the way to headquarters
joe you know that and i know that but the new general doesnt know it
or he wont for about an hour and a half
that sergeantll be a private tomorrow
isnt he lucky
he takes the adjutant by the arm and leads him toward the recreation area
captain bob wallace bing crosby is wearing a makeshift beard and santa claus hat and private philip davis donald oconnor is in combat clothes
they are doing a number to entertain the soldiers what does a soldier want for christmas
during introduction we just starting to take seats off to one side where they are not noticed by the performers
seated in audience
they look off see general start to rise
the general notices them motions for them to sit down again indicating he doesnt want attention called to himself
the number concludes to applause
bob holds up his hand for silence
he removes his beard
i guess by now you know the old mans being replaced by a new commanding general fresh out of the pentagon
this divisionss been awfully lucky so far but tonight theyre running a special on st
christophers at the px
the old mans heading back to the rear hes never moved in that direction in his life
all i can say is we owe so much to general waverly and the way a bellow automatically bob stiffens
phil does the same
every man is at attention and every head has turned to where general waverly has taken up a position near the front of the platform
captain wallace button your shirt
youre out of uniform
bob grinning hastily buttons his shirt this division is now under the command of general harold g
carlton and i dont want anyone to forget it not that hell let you
hes tough just what this sloppy outfit needs
youll be standing inspection night and day you may even learn how to march
and if you dont give him everything you got i may come back and fight for the enemy
the boys respond with merry christmas
embarrassed well i guess thats about it uh uh bob covering his embarrassment perhaps i can help you out sir
he turns to the musicians gives the downbeat
they play the old man which is sung by the entire outfit
the general stands at attention through the first chorus visibly moved
during the second chorus he starts up the aisle revealing for the first time that his left leg is bandaged to the knee
the adjutant puts out his arm to help
toward the finish of the song he turns faces the men and salutes them
the men return the salute
this is not a military mistake the general salutes the enlisted men as a deliberate gesture
there is a red cross ambulance standing by
the camera pulls back to reveal a hand lighting a candle on a tiny makeshift christmas tree
we reveal a number of enlisted men huddled around the tree in a trench including bob and phil
one of the men looks at his wristwatch
now another does
the hand is approaching midnight
he is looking at his wristwatch
the second hand is pointing to the hour
this is the prearranged signal for bob to begin singing white christmas
phil accompanies him on a harmonica
toward the end of the song an enemy barrage drowns out the music
a shell bursts in the vicinity
phil pulls bob down in time to save him from the shrapnel burst
this has also pushed bobs face into the mud which he thinks is unnecessary
phil ignoring bobs hostile look brightly continues with white christmas from where the song left off
bob finishes with him but eyeing him
camera shooting up to the sky as brilliant fireworks explosion lights up the screen
over scene superimpose headline reads v e day
as camera moves fast into headline we lose the fireworks display and the headline covers the whole screen
bells are ringing for celebration of v e day
camera moves into mouth of one bell blacking out the screen
featuring names and pictures of bob and phil
camera moves to a close shot of the picture holds for a second then suddenly the picture comes to life and we are on the stage of the theatre where
bob and phil are doing the production number bells
perhaps twenty people photographed at a slant
one woman has a fan some use programs
they are enjoying the show however
there are some vacant seats apparent
this theatre is a modern traveling tent show such as have been playing in florida in recent years and beyond the sides we see palm trees characteristic of florida
applauding the conclusion of the number
the curtain is down the boys come off the curtain goes up on the next number which is dancing
phil and bob are met by cooke the company manager
rita a luscious latin type and some of the remaining chorus girls and other players ad lib couldnt be cuter
to bob and phil new yorks on the telephone
bob and phil with cooke go to the backstage telephone
into phone hello
to bob and cooke oscar
this is the business office of bob and phil
oscar is their representative and manager not their employer
he is sixty and looks competent
he refers to a telegram in his hand
pictures of the boys adorn the desk and wallace and davis sheets of previous shows are on the wall
it must be evident from their billing that the boys are important stars in new york
listen i just heard what youre doing giving the cast a week off with pay for christmas
you dont know how touched i am
im all choked up
between sobs i managed to book you on the ed harrison show this week to take up the slack
itll be stealing money
phil is holding the receiver up to bob
oscars voice can be plainly heard
into phone well have to go to new york four days and four nights of rehearsals thats stealing money
as he speaks into the telephone it is for me i get ten percent
he listens for a moment next time you guys make a charitable gesture find out if you got with what to make it
see you wednesday
he hangs up
bob hangs up the phone
while the cast takes it easy well be slaving over a hot kinnie
what train do you want
theres a one thirty this morning but you have to sit up all night
lets get out tonight
the boys walk to their dressing room
a group of the chorines come flying by toward the dressing rooms with squealing
they make quite a picture from the rear bouncing and all
what are we going to do until one thirty
well eat dinner
looking at the retreating bouncing eat eat all you think of is your stomach
rita shows up in front of phil
eagerly you said you had something to rehearse with me after the show
what is it
phil evidently was trying to hide this from bob and is self conscious at being caught
its a kind of new dance number
eagerly im ready
taking phil by the arm he isnt
some business has come up
see you in a week
he pulls phil away come on romeo dinner
tempting him lamb chops lamb chops
pretending that he is letting himself be pulled while he is still anxious to go in the other direction im looking at them
were going in the wrong direction
the boys are now finishing their dinner
bob is facing the orchestra phil would have to turn to see it
the music plays the boys eat
the table is close to the bar
on two stools sit judy and betty
betty is wearing her glasses and examining some railroad tickets that have just been handed her by the bartender
phil is not paying attention to his eating he is entranced with judys pretty legs draped over the bar stool
bob cannot see the girls and is not even interested enough to turn around
on her part judy is not absorbed in the tickets but is unobtrusively sizing up phil
checking the tickets well have to rush to get the train
bob notices phils absorption
have you ever considered laying off the female sex for awhile
what other kind is there
he picks up the card which announces the performers names and reads the stewart sisters
he smacks his lips
he doesnt realize that these two girls are the stewart sisters down rover down
remember we have an agreement you chase no new tidbits during the season
you were man enough to give me your hand on it
you were sneaky enough to take it
betty looks from the tickets and sees that judy is covertly eyeing phil
she leans forward
judys eyes are toward phil
a little louder ahem
all right dear relax
hes awful cute
so was the one in kansas city and the one in canton ohio and the one in waco texas
mock seriousness canton ohio wasnt so much
one of these days youre going to meet somebody extra cute and the next performance ill be doing a single
sincerely nobodyll ever be cute enough to break up this sister act
phil is still fingering the card
i havent much luck with sister acts
theyre all alike
shall i tell you what these two are like
four feet two inches tall
have big bows in their hair
he parodies a smile lots of teeth
sister acts have more teeth than anybody else
two three hundred teeth at a time
the american dental association is investigating it
there is a drum roll from the orchestra
betty takes off her glasses and puts them in their case on the bar
the bandleaders voice announces ladies and gentleman the stewart sisters
the audience applauds politely while the girls start toward the platform phil reacts in surprise to the new development
betty and judy do their number sisters
as they take their bows phil pretends to recognize judy
remember that girl i told you about who got sick in st
the girl in the oxygen tent
i told you about her
the road company of student prince
the whole company went to church and prayed for her
it was the most touching thing ive ever seen in show business
ill bring her over
he goes bob watching disgusted
novello the owner of the waterfront inn comes up
novello evidently knows bob
didnt you get your dessert yet mr
im not having any but i think my partners lining up some pastries now
sure wish i could afford to book you boys here
call our agent weve got half an hour between trains
phil enters the shot with judy and betty
hello mister novello
good evening mister davis
novello pulls out the table to permit the girls to be seated
burlesque formality miss stewart mister wallace
miss stewart mister wallace
how do you do
rising how do you do
phil gets betty next to bob he sits next to judy
see you later folks
he leaves we saw your show at the matinee and we liked it very much

the orchestra has gone into white christmas

we spent last christmas in south carolina the year before in hawaii
they didnt seem like christmases
there ought to be snow
this ones going to be real white
well its the way youve been raised
if you saw a lot of snow when you were a kid you miss it more around christmas
theres a lot of snow around st

it dawns on him slowly
he shows no emotion
you come from st
i come from canton ohio
just for the record he knows id like to ask you something
were you ever in an oxygen tent
were you ever in a road company of student prince
bob looks at phil
the rules are clear between them
bob puts his hand out
phil takes it
what i admire are the details the invention the little lies all around the big one
it takes talent
oh its nothing
dont say that
dont belittle yourself
credit where credit is due
you did it fine
little game we play
to judy may i have this dance
id love to
helping her up im not going to keep calling you miss stewart
the name is judy
to bob what a pretty name
theyre off nicer than dolores
im low man
he takes her arm indicating phil and judy follow that couple
they move toward the dance floor
want to make sure they keep dancing
he wont get any place with her
i trained her myself
shes in the ring with the champ though
youve heard of alcoholics anonymous
she nods he indicates phil women anonymous
their biggest case
keeps falling off the wagon
well you keep an eye on him and ill keep an eye on her
we can make out the probation report together
the orchestra blends into a vocal chorus of the song
to be decided upon
the vocal is shared by bob betty judy and phil individually
toward the end of the vocal phil dances judy out to the terrace overlooking the water
this blends into their dance
the staging of the number should reunite the four principals by the end of the number
the audience applauds and they all go back to their booth
they are a half dozen steps ahead of the boys
theyre both very cute arent they
hiding her real interest both
which one do you like best
i like them both
you cant have both
theres a law
oh well never meet them again what does it matter
the men are now up to them and help them into the booth
bob does not sit
judy you made even him look good
pleased youre very flattering but he was doing all the leading
fair you dance very well together
if i say it
sitting lightest girl i ever saw
floats like a bubble
one big bubble
all right bubble lover stand up
i just sat down
at one thirty and we have to pack
you know choo choo
goes on tracks
train whistle noise wo woo
cant we go tomorrow
the train goes tonight
phil looks disconsolately at judy say goodbye to the lady bubble because were going to have to run for it now
lady bubble i have an idea were going to meet up again sometime
we might were on the same train
pulling phil away no
as they start off novello enters to the girls agitated
the sheriff is here
hes in my office
hes got a warrant to arrest you
bob has stopped
he looks at phil suspiciously
i thought we watched you every minute
phil holds up his hand in scouts honor
never stopped dancing
bob turns back to the table
to the girls can we help
fearful ive never been arrested
theres nothing to it
dont get panicky
yes dont get excited you still have to give your show
apologetically hes not going to arrest them until after the show
howd you arrange that
im a taxpayer here
you better go in and change girls
you havent much time
the girls start off confused
novello bob and phil follow
may i enquire what you are being arrested for
the owner of the hotel we were at says we dropped a cigarette on his rug and burned it
we couldnt have dropped a cigarette because we dont smoke
he wants two hundred dollars but its just plain stealing
we left the money for our bill in an envelope on the bed
then we dropped the bags out the window and checked them at the depot
what are we going to do now
you have to give another show
he leaves them as bob and phil look unpleasantly after him
they have reached the wings
stagehand is setting up a record on a record playing mechanism backstage as the group passes by heading for the dressing rooms
the old burned rug routine
kind of old fashioned isnt it
i thought that went out with the cherry sisters
well have to do something
hopefully got a flash
have to stir it around a little
the girls have opened the door to their dressing room
we wouldnt want you boys to get into any trouble
as they all enter
maybe well all wind up in the same cell
as they close the door novello is with the sheriff and the landlord
the sheriff is a husky fellow
at the moment hes eating an eclair and coffee from novellos desk
the landlord glares at him
thats the second dessert youve had sheriff
real good too
i havent got all night to wait here while you eat free food
youve got your warrant arrest those girls
displeased now we agreed to let them finish their show first
i didnt agree
to novello that was his idea
ive got some rights too
you dont get those girls until after theyve done their number
well how long is it going to take
novello puts his hand up listening
wait a minute
thats their music
he gets up opens the office door and we hear their entrance music as before and the orchestra leaders voice the stewart sisters
bob and phil stand with their backs to the audience
they turn face front and we realize they are mouthing to a record
we identify that the music is coming from this spinning record player we have previously established
bob and phil do the number
they applaud at end of number
we faintly hear the applause
the sheriff gets up
the boys bow themselves off and run toward their dressing room
they hurry down the corridor passing the office door
get out of these clothes
ma unhook my bra
the office door opens behind them which they do not see
the sheriff steps out followed by the landlord and novello
calm just a second folks
ill handle this
he walks to the dressing room door there is a plaque attached to the key in the lock
the sheriff smilingly turns the key in the lock
he puts the key in his pocket
winking you stay here
let them try to go through the window
the landlord is delighted
if they make a break for it shoot em
the sheriff walks around the corner of the cafe and a police car awaits with cop at the wheel
just a minute hank couple of customers coming up
the sheriff continues to the window of our dressing room
the sheriff watches it
out comes phils legs meaning to get out backwards
the sheriff applies both hands and pushes back
back you go boys
he pushes phil in
nimbly he raises himself in
the sheriff is in the room
he looks coolly at the boys who are now in their own clothes
he stares at them
they stare at him
recognition comes all at once
they all throw their arms around each other pounding violently
you dirty skunk
you grave robber
unbelieving are you the sheriff here
you bet i am
howd you get in this line of work
after i got out of the army i sat down and figured it out
who never got in trouble in the army
they were the ones who arrested you
so i came back here and ran for sheriff
a civilian m
if the fellows ever saw you now
theyd skin you alive
you ever see any of them
whitey harris and jack ross have a filling station near here
will you ever forget the party he threw in naples
in a captured brewery
very sensible giving a party in a brewery
cuts out the middleman
do you remember when danny beasly climbed up as he says danny beasly he recalls danny is dead the tower of the city hall and rang the bell by swinging
on the clapper
he couldnt hear anything for two days
too bad he didnt make it
not everybody was lucky
we were lucky in one thing the old man
you can say that again
say im supposed to arrest a couple of dames
a fellow swore out a warrant
hes a crook
burned a hole in a rug and is trying to hold up two kids
you dont say
at his watch we got to get our bags and be at the station in ten minutes
well never make it
just a moment
he goes to the window hank
hank looks up enquiringly
take my friends where they want to go
going out the window thanks pete
hank has thrown the door open
do you think we can make it
this thing goes over a hundred an hour
he starts with his red lights going his siren screaming and tires grinding
the sheriff watches them go pleased
a pounding on the door recalls the landlord and he frowns
he strides to the door takes out his key and opens it
the landlord and novello are looking out the window at the departing police car the noise having distracted them from the door pounding
the siren is still heard retreating
the sheriff snaps his cigarette at their feet
they turn to him faces alight
were pursuing em
pointing what do you mean smoking on theatrical premises
thats not mine
i wasnt smoking
whats that burning
he grabs him by the shoulder not too gently and starts him out come on
he protests what
novello is openmouthed
the train is already moving as the police car arrives
the girls are on the observation platform
the police car screams to a stop
the boys fly out with bags and just make the train the girls pulling them aboard
seriously you didnt steal the police car
friend of ours
they go toward the lounge car
they all take seats in the lounge car happy to have accomplished their escape
well well be together as far as new york
maybe itll snow in new york for christmas
if it doesnt well mail you a snowball from vermont
i havent been on ice skates in years
you mean the stuff in a scotch and soda
suddenly bob how about snow for christmas
youll only thaw it out
come on bob we could have a great week up in vermont
bob looks from him to judy whose expression is almost pleading
i see what you mean
but wednesday weve got to be back in new york
all right so its just for a couple of days
dont you want me to enjoy the winter sports
you enjoy them all year round
he looks to betty we wont get in your way will we
as long as your friend doesnt try to take my sister for a sleigh ride
if he tries it ill smash his flexible flyer
to phil its all set
really pleased the thing i like about you bob is youre not only kind and generous youre handsome
were going to have to sit up all night
lets get some shut eye
the rhythm of the wheels and the engine funnel underscored musically
all but phil are half dozing
one or two other people are seen in the background asleep
there is an air of peace and quiet in the car as the music underscoring continues
their faces are occasionally streaked with light flashes emanating from the surrounding countryside
phil turns to the side of the car and sees a bill poster showing a copy of a winter scene from the grandma moses collection advertising vermont
camera pulls up to scene the music swells and we dissolve to a similar landscape in stylized concept
this is the winter fantasy production number
at the end of the fantasy we hear the conductors voice pine tree
pine tree vermont
they are bundling themselves up coat collars tight expecting to enter the snow country
pine tree station all green no snow
four hotel busses await one marked columbia inn bus
our foursome is just getting off the train
they are the only ones
they are looking about puzzled
are you sure this is the right vermont
this isnt a southern vermont
i dont understand it
there has to be snow
this place is advertised as americas snow playground
well if you say so
gesturing to the waiting columbia inn bus driver driver your sleigh and reindeer
the other three bus drivers are disappointed
the bus goes by an incongruous skating rink with water instead of ice
signs indicate the direction of the sun scorched toboggan slide
the bus winds around another turn in the beautiful green surroundings and we pass a ski lift and a ski jumping platform
still another turn of the bus and in the distance we see a long shot of the columbia inn
martha a sixty year old spinsterish woman good of heart forbidding exterior is occupied at the desk
the door opens and a pretty fifteen year old susan carrying the mail walks toward her
she puts the mail on the desk
as she shuffles through it whats the weather forecast down at the post office
fair and warmer
if we dont get snow soon we can turn this hotel into a haunted house
we havent had a guest for three weeks
as martha keeps searching through the mail what are you looking for
not finding it your grandfathers written washington asking if he can get back in active service
i think he wants to fly jets
i think he could do it
he says older men have been called and besides he misses the food
i tell you susan he tried to make it a casual letter with little jokes but it came out just begging
through the huge window behind susan and martha we see the figure of a man in overalls bending over an incinerator shoveling the ashes into a wheelbarrow
his back is to camera
moved oh martha
what are we going to do
blowing her nose i dont know
dont let on we know hes written
hell start in im only his housekeeper and that i found out through some chicanery or something
soothing her how did you find out
like any housekeeper i read the carbon paper
she hands the mail to susan bring him the mail
susan starts out as camera moves up to window
after a moment susan appears and crosses to the man in overalls
he straightens up dusts off his hands and as he turns to take the letters we see for the first time that he is general waverly
he looks through them eagerly then downcast shoves them in his overalls and goes back to his work
the bus comes to a stop and our principals get out phil staying with the driver for the luggage
the others enter the inn
martha at the desk and her eyes widen in surprise
happily welcome to columbia inn
how do you do
how do you do
offering pen what kind of accommodations would you like
we can give you a fairly wide choice any room in the inn including mine
were not here as guests
were the stewart sisters
my friend and i are guests
weve come down for the snow
where are you keeping it
we take it in during the day
looking around what are your rates here
make us an offer
to the girls im afraid we wont be able to use you
well pay you the half salary for canceling
are things that bad
were using the ski tow to hang the wash on
to bob youre not going to stay either are you
shaking his head im afraid not maam
through the door comes waverly carrying a load of wood in one arm and a bucket of coke in the other hand
susan follows carrying an armful of kindling
bob turns away
ill tell phil to leave the luggage it hits him he comes to a stop and then to attention general waverly
easy simple at ease
how are you captain
im fine sir
but he looks around questioningly bewildered smiling we just try to keep the general part quiet
reminding himself begging your pardon sir
well to put it in one sentence people dont expect major generals to carry firewood
through the door comes phil fast talking bob i was thinking we ought to phil has his arm out indicating the direction of the door when he sees waverly
he brings his hand up to a salute from that position
horrified a janitor
never thought id make it he
matter of fact its worse than that
i own this hotel
he got it in a shrewd business move
to bob was everybody in your outfit
we seem to run into them all over the country
the draft board didnt know when to stop
if i start the introductions can i get to meet these young ladies
indicating them my housekeeper miss martha allen my granddaughter susan waverly
im bob wallace this is phil davis were the stewart sisters
your floor show
to waverly dont worry ive already told them wed have to cancel
we have a floor havent we
last time i looked
but who are they going to sing to
even if its only to you and me it will be well worth it
besides there will be six inches of snow tonight and well be full up tomorrow
happily is that the weather forecast
but if there was one thing i learned in the army it was to be positive especially when you dont know what youre talking about
youll excuse me gentlemen im on k
phil and bob stiffen automatically
to betty and judy and you two charming ladies i want you to know im looking forward to your show this evening
whatever your audience lacks in numbers it will make up for in enthusiasm he glares at martha or ill know the reason why
he smiles at the girls and exits dignified
utterly charmed gee
no wonder we won the war
they are doing the number sisters on the floor
the camera pulls back to reveal the scene
there is a scant audience distributed at several tables totaling not more than fourteen in number
not far from the kitchen entrance bob and phil are sitting at one table
martha is seen doing general overseeing principally acting as hostess
susan doubles between the cashiers desk and helping out at table
they are admiring the performance
phil indicates for bob to look in this direction
the general is seating a table
bob shakes his head unhappy at this condition
they look at each other
i think well stay a little longer than we planned
they finish the number and are applauded enthusiastically but the few people in the audience dont make for much clatter
one set of hands seems to be applauding loudest and clearest
he is the one doing the enthusiastic applauding
he walks toward the boys still applauding
they applaud too
the girls enter the scene to sit with the boys
martha is only applauding politely until waverly glares at her
then her enthusiasm is boundless
i enjoyed it very much
it was nice if you like music
a waitress brings food which martha helps distribute
after a look that the waitress is not in a position to hear mister waverly wed like to make you a proposition
smiling well for heavens sake
youve been very nice not canceling wed like to make a gesture
until it snows and you have guests well take half salary
appreciative thats really nice of you
she takes out pencil and her order book now lets get that in writing
pushing it aside never heard of anything so ridiculous
gets up your next performance is tomorrow night after dinner
be here or ill sue
he dignifiedly walks in the direction of some departing guests and proceeds to show them to the door
annoyed light horse harry
advance advance never retreat
hes advancing right into bankruptcy
thats just the way he was in the army
always thinking of the other fellow
we ate and then he ate
we slept and then he slept
then he woke up and nobody slept for the next forty eight hours
i happen to know hes sunk his lifes savings into this place
i read the carbon paper
gee i wish there were something we could do to help
maybe there is
you got a flash
have to stir it around a bit
to the girls shhh
indicating bob tapping his forehead ticking away madly
wheels within wheels
this is the brain that in darkest italy devised a formula to make food out of k ration
as he regards bob with something akin to awe we the last of the supper audience is leaving
we see into a room which adjoins the reservation desk and bob is on the phone
phil is sitting on the desk while bob talks
into phone relax
i didnt ask you how much itll cost us
we hear an excited high voice on the phone easy easy remember your blood pressure
i dont care how much itll cost us
have everybody on the train first thing in the morning
the whole troupe and the scenery and the costumes
youll have to cancel us off the ed harrison show
oscar remember your blood pressure
incidentally how much will this cost
he hears some figure
it obviously is a very large number good night oscar
he hangs up there you are
incidentally how much will this cost
clears his throat we are coming out even
you mean flat
thats the same as even
wheels within wheels
its nice how you take care of the money for both of us because youre older and so level headed
i wonder where id be now if hadnt saved your life
do you want me to cancel the troupe coming
getting off the desk no no
lets go through the gesture
if you had been on the titanic when it went down you wouldntve been satisfied just to sink into the ocean
gesturing youd have done a swan dive into it
with me on your back
the scene is a melee of the excitement accompanying preparations for the show
the little stage has been enlarged the draperies pulled back right and left and a side wall pushed back a little farther
there is hammering and painting going on in various parts of the room
trunks have been unpacked and wardrobe hung up in odd places as more trunks arrive
girls in abbreviated rehearsal clothes walk around do cartwheels two people sing at the piano six girls kick in unison altogether it is quite a contrast to the bareness of
the previous scene
the camera trucks through all the activity taking in our group at the doorway which features bob and phil the girls standing nearby
martha and susan are amazed at the activity
i cant believe it
you mean you brought the whole show up here
when you hired the stewart sisters you also hired a new york show
it was in the small print
and you cant get out of it
weve got lawyers
i cant thank you enough but i wonder if grampll let you do it
when he decides hes going into bankruptcy he likes to go
now just a second
were not doing this for him
were bringing the show down here to rehearse
the companys been getting a little ragged
wed appreciate the use of the hall
of course we dont expect it free
well pay a little but not much
you see the audience will be guinea pigs and for us thats quite an improvement
this has not fooled susan
she throws her arms around bob and then phil
i dont know what to say
she cannot refrain from tears of gratitude and turns and runs out
there is a moment of silence
i hope this is not an indication of advancing age getting kissed out of gratitude
you didnt expect a girl that pretty to kiss you because she wanted to
a body keeps hoping
betty steps up to him and gives him the biggest smack
bob is quite surprised
sincerely that was the nicest thing i ever saw anybody do
it was still gratitude
to judy im his partner
im entitled to half the credit
judy steps up to him and just pecks him on the cheek then joins her sister in rehearsal shes not as grateful as her sister
they look off through the exit and see a moving van unloading scenery as the general arrives in his buggy
he steps down and looks with amazement at the scenery passing by
waverly is looking interestedly at the goings on but is puzzled
the boys exchange a glance
finally im not clear about some of it
explain it again
not too good a job well sir
we have this show and we laid off for the holidays
you see business was bad
i know about business being bad
well so we figured as long as we had the opportunity wed do a little rehearsing
there is a hint here of the general phil looks to bob for help as they move toward the lobby
the troupe is busy transporting the costumes etc
from the moving van to the dining room auditorium as the above scene is played
well sir this nice empty room
the minute we looked at it we said it was ideal
thats what we said
and then well have an audience to play to
you see sir you need an audience on which to try out your new material
where are you going to get the audience
oh what guests there are in the other hotels
theyre pretty bored here without snow and a new york shows kind of a novelty in vermont
i would think so
he thinks how will they know youre here
oh word gets around
yes sir and we also took the girls twice around the town for a little run
they were stiff from the train
in their practice clothes
makes the blood circulate hers no dope hmm
apparently there must be a lot about show business i dont understand
itll come to you sir
it just takes time
we wouldnt be any good as generals
you werent any good as privates
pointing to bob he was an officer sir
only to confuse the enemy
he turns away and goes to his quarters
the company is rehearsing as bob and phil enter
thats all for today kids
people break off what they were doing and begin to drift out
bob and phil have gone toward betty and judy
get a little rest before tonights performance
to judy ill walk you over
he takes a sheet of music out of his inside pocket look this over i want to try something
to judy see you later
the girls go
phil goes toward the piano bob goes toward martha who is on the phone accepting reservations
bob takes martha by the arm and seats her in the middle of the room as an audience of one
phil looks up from the piano puzzled
the sunset is visible through the window and there is a mood of quiet
nodding thats the idea
want you to hear a song i just wrote
if its a love song dont get too close
just tell me how you think the old man would feel about this one
he leaves her and goes to the piano and they do what can you do with a general solely for martha
toward the end of the song unseen by the others he is standing by the door listening to the song
the boys finish the number
martha applauds and bob bows
very moved i think its just wonderful she is standing there drying her eyes with her apron
i think so too
im afraid i disagree
the song is funny but there is one thing wrong with it
whats that sir
id rather you didnt
bob and phil exchange a quick glance
the general turns and exits toward the lobby the camera pans with him a lonely figure walking through the lobby the camera stopping on a poster advertising tonights performance
it is fairly well filled
bob phil betty judy and the ensemble are performing a number which is a minstrel show routine done to lyrics and music
bob and phil are end men betty is interlocutor and judy is later introduced as mandy
this takes judy and phil into a dance to the song mandy
this entire number is done in white face with stylized costumes and set
during the applause and bows we cut to waverly flanked by susan and martha is at a large table
the other occupants are local hotel owners and their wives
great show waverly
we needed something like this
i had six checkouts and when they heard about this they decided to stay
big smile much obliged
glad to help
martha and susan beam all is well
it is empty and most of the lights are out
at a considerable distance from camera martha extinguishes the last light except for a small work light which is servicing bob who is fingering the piano keys and writing music
notes hard at work
in the background we see the boys bungalow
betty and judy are in twin beds the light is coming in from the moon
the girls are seen in profile
talkative the moon
i cant get over the moon up here
the size of it
in a quiet mood same one they have all over
theyll never prove it to me
and everything smells so beautiful
she breathes what is it pine or fir
small sniff were near the bakery
friendly not realizing the stab you know your trouble betty
youre not romantic
betty turns and looks toward her
since judy does not see her bettys expression is a true reflection of how she feels
everythings so wonderful here so pretty so exciting i cant understand how you stay frozen up
let yourself go go like me
afraid to ask which one is it
what do you mean
bob or phil
you mean both
smiling its the same
no one is going to break up our act
isnt there one you prefer over the other
the way phil dances and hes funny
its easy to see yourself married to him
an effort and bob
hes different deeper and hes funny too
itd be nice to be married to both of them
good thing theyre not a quartette
oblivious if i was catherine the great thats what id do
phil in the daytime bob at night
or should it be the other way around
shooting past betty
is it possible our betty has a suspicion of a tear
phild be more fun in a night club but eventually a girl wants a pipe and slipper fellow
thats bob smoking a pipe and petting a cocker spaniel
still phil could learn to smoke a pipe
breaking a fellow in to suit you is something every girl should go through
i hear its half the fun
which one do you like better
softer are you asleep
judy turns over and closes her eyes music has underscored this scene
betty is wide awake
she is looking toward the window
as the curtains billow outward we see a diffused figure of bob sitting on a fence putting out his pipe
this is followed by an equally diffused figure of betty leaving her bed crossing the furniture and joining bob
bob takes her in his arms
at this point we are brought back to reality by the wind slamming a shutter
this causes the diffusion to vanish and betty gets out of bed and puts on her robe
we pan betty to the refrigerator door which she opens
tuna fish on the lower shelf
betty whirls around
we see bob is having a snack of his own
what are you doing
i couldnt sleep
little young for that arent you
he gets up and goes to the refrigerator
his preoccupation with the food will permit bettys expression to be more obvious than her lines which are spoken to tell the audience of her regard for bob since their
significance must escape him
what shall i make you
if you tell me what you want to dream about ill know what to make you
amused hows that
different foods make for different dreams
ive got a whole theory about it
its called the wallace way of wishful wooing
youll find it in the american medical journal under w
ham and swiss cheese for instance you get a cool thin blonde girl
turkey sandwich you get a dark sort of stumpy girl sexy though
now a liverwurst sandwich he shakes his head you get both girls at once
what do you dream on tuna
darndest thing i dream about me
evenly then ill have a tuna sandwich
bob doesnt get the significance of what she has said
now thats very flattering
tuna coming up
he is occupied at the frigidaire while she watches him yearningly let me make you some warm milk
thatll help the insomnia
meaningly no it wont
looking straight at his back warm milk wont do it
whatever youve got on your mind isnt worth staying awake for
i think it is
he smiles at her oblivious to the meaning behind her lines
would you like to know how i handle a situation like that
tell me doctor
bob begins to sing count your blessings as he prepares the warm milk and hands it to her
she drinks it down
as he reaches the second chorus he starts to dim the lamp on the table betty pretending to be sleepy leans her head toward bob
he takes a pillow from a nearby chair and puts it between her head and her chair
she waits eyes closed expectantly
but bob gets to his feet and carefully tiptoes to the door and exits closing it softly behind him
after a moment betty snaps on the light throws the pillow on the floor and rests her chin in her hand disappointed and wide awake
various members of the company are in rehearsal clothes and sitting around the room
the orchestra is playing the introduction to phils number which will employ a line of six girls who are just coming on the floor
bob is on stage supervising the rehearsal
judy is standing across from the piano
betty is seated on the sidelines with her legs stretched over two chairs
she is knitting a loud colored argyle sock
phil standing close by has just finished rolling up a ball of yarn
he looks at bettys knitting then at his feet
dont make them too tight
i wear size
all right kids
lets get going
phil youre on
bob crosses to his stage manager station which is a desk and high chair where albert is seated not far from his wife sylvia who is sipping a glass of
albert holds a stop watch and evidently helps in the administration
to albert how long are we so far
an hour and ten minutes
something has to come out
from his position phil in a series of leaps and turns reaches center floor and begins his solo
she continues knitting while watching phil dancing
as phil comes to a portion where he speeds up his steps she unconsciously speeds up her knitting bob has seen her and he looks from her knitting and her
look of admiration which he mistakes for affection and then looks from the socks to phils feet
at the end of the number which is applauded by the witnesses judy runs to phil and hugs and kisses him the camera staying at this distance
bob looking at betty mistakenly sees her disappointment
all right places for the next number
he turns to sylvia youre next sylvia
sylvia and albert exchange peculiar glances bob senses it whats the trouble
wallace he is embarrassed to go on come on out with it
i dont think sylvia ought to go on unless you cut out the high kicks and let her do some easy waltzes
very easy waltzes
bob looks from one to the other and their smiling shyness indicates pregnancy
we dont want anyone else to know
please dont mention it
the orchestra starts to play rockabye baby
sylvia and albert are startled for heavens sake
how did they know
the girls start crowding around
ad libbing you wouldnt tell us would you
we had to find out ourselves etc
phil and judy are among the group formally there will be a celebration of the forthcoming event tonight after the show
everyone approves phil puts his arm around albert
obviously youre going to call the boy after me
i hired sylvia
the babyll be named after me
ive been dancing with her
thats more important
the babyll be named after me
the hiring was more important
the dancing was more important
im her husband
small pause the babyll be named after me
well were going to need another dancer
how about judy she knows all the routines she could pick it up in no time
they walk to the table where the coffee is and the group now includes betty
on the other hand its all right if we lose a number were running too long now
we have to cut somewhere
wouldnt it be better if you cut my solo number
ive never felt right in it anyway
indicating phil the show needs every bit of his dancing
interpreting this as mere selflessness for love well there you are painless
she turns away rather abruptly since she is becoming emotional
bob shakes his head impressed with what he thinks is her devotion
bob dunks a doughnut into his coffee as he looks after betty
he looks at phil and shakes his head
greater love hath no woman than to give up a solo number
old chinese saying
all this is beyond him what are you talking about
drink your coffee
this is the party later that evening
some people are dancing
others are grouped about and there is a general home party atmosphere
the general martha and susan are seen helping everyone to feel at home
the camera starts on a long shot and dollies through the group passing sylvia where ad lib comments about the impending baby are sketchily heard
the camera continues toward the piano where bob and betty are examining the music sheet of a man chases a girl
betty looks up and the camera follows her look to phil who is dancing with rita
rita nestles up close to phil
this is seen by bob and betty
on closer view we can see that rita is the aggressor
referring to the grip dont you want me to breathe
whats gotten into you
you were chasing me in florida
and you were running
what made you stop
youre interested in judy arent you
thats it eh
unless it belongs to someone else a girl doesnt ouch
evidently rita has deliberately stepped on his instep betty is walking over to the dancing couple and deliberately cuts in on rita who is displeased but can do nothing but
bobs reaction still implies that this is understandable since betty loves phil
he turns back toward the piano and other couples are between him and betty and phil
still at the same camera distance we see betty turning phil over to judy
judy is a little cool
whats the matter
nothing is the matter
this isnt the way you dance
some people dance closer than others
phil is delighted that she is jealous
yes thats true
im one of the close ones
thats my type
he holds her closely by force dancing smiling and pleased with himself
the dance music stops
the people disperse
harry the piano player is playing the last half of a man chases a girl
bob and betty are leaning over the piano bob humming the melody
betty pantomimes to the others to quiet down
bob starts to sing the lyric
in the second chorus he is joined in the singing by betty
during this chorus we cut to show various reactions of the group and end on phil sitting close to judy holding her hand
we hear bob and betty off scene continuing to the end of the second chorus on which phil sotto voce sings the last four bars
singing looking at judy and once youve caught him dont ever let him go
applause follows the song
phil gets up
ladies and gentlemen i would like to make an announcement
everyone quiets waiting to hear the announcement
it is my pleasure to identify the man who has been doing the chasing
i am him
anyway judy has caught me
what im trying to say is were engaged
he looks fondly at judy taking it for granted she is overwhelmed at this method of announcing to her that he is going to marry her
he hugs her amidst a general reaction of congratulations
he is flabbergasted
phil and judy are separated by the congratulators
betty hiding her emotion grips phils arm
i hope you realize that youre getting he most wonderful girl in the world
bob sees her emotion through the speech
betty notices judy upset shaking off the people around her and running through the doorway to the kitchen
betty makes her way through the crowd to follow her as the orchestra goes into her comes the bride
judy is crying into her hands as betty enters
darling dont cry
turning to her i didnt know he was going to make that announcement i swear i didnt
betty puts one arm around her
i know you didnt
he had no right to do that
you do love him dont you
that doesnt matter
nothing else matters
were not going to break up our act
phil enters the kitchen
ive been looking for you judy
she goes through the corridor toward the living room
in the background we see the general in the butlers pantry getting some drinks for the guests
he is not seen by betty who stops at the mirror in the corridor to wipe away a few tears
bob comes into view in the mirror entering the corridor from the living room
dont take this too much to heart
phil is a great kid but constancy isnt his long suit
im not the least bit worried
phil and judy enter from the kitchen frankly this couldnt come at a better time
they want me to come back to the carousel again i used to sing there before judy and i teamed up and i had to turn it down because they
can only use a single
not too well so this couldnt be more convenient
you stay with the show and ill go back to the carousel
when did you get this offer
just today as a matter of fact
i got a telegram
why didnt you mention it before
i didnt want to hurt your feelings
where is the telegram
i threw it away
what is this a third degree
you dont think i made it up
yes i do
there is a pause and waverly who has been watching each one speaks
well now i wouldnt bet any large sum of money on that since i took the message over the telephone and i had to deliver the telegram
to take the tension off and she didnt tip me either
betty looks at him gratefully
she throws her arms around her im sorry
its all right
well everythings fine now
happy he beams at judy
something bothers bob about this story
he looks searchingly at betty puzzled
he does not notice waverly who watches him watching betty
train about to leave
the general is in the foreground sitting in the buggy
betty is saying goodbye to him
bob and the porter are taking care of her luggage
shouting over noise of train where are you going to be
the general looks at her questioningly
whispering during a lull in the noise i sent them a telegram this morning
the general smiles betty waves a farewell to him and crosses to the train starting up the steps
the notion behind this scene is to be able to hear only intermittent dialogue due to the whistle bells and escaping steam
the manner of playing though indicates the sentiment
to emphasize it bob is fonder of betty than he realizes and betty fully realizes how fond she is of him but that he does not return consciously her affection
we hear betty take care of my little sister
she can take care of herself
worry about the menfolk
now dont forget to write
ill send you picture postcards
not all of this is heard since the sound effects pick their spots but the attention is on the general who is watching the scene with a whimsical look
he as does the audience realizes bobs true feelings
as the train starts to leave betty and bob shake hands
she holds his handshake a little longer than necessary and bob is forced to move along with the train
finally she releases him and bob looks after the train puzzled
the camera is now on the train platform bob out of sight
betty wipes away a tear
in the background we see the general in the buggy noticing this
bob is in the foreground the general in the background
bob joins the general at the buggy
from waverlys expression we can see that he has decided on a plan of action
must be interesting to be a woman
the ideas never occurred to me sir
well think about it
bob is thinking about it well
a man like you must be an expert on women
its a little immodest to say so but i consider myself an authority on the fair sex ive made a study of the subject
theyre simple creatures
they couldnt fool you
pride goeth before a fall
who knows his own strength is twice armed
its always a pleasure to meet an expert in any field
tell me why do you think betty went to new york
not willing to admit it she has a job in the carousel
expert youre wrong
she went to new york because shes so in love with someone here she just couldnt stand it
a mixture of resentment and frustration im darned if i can figure out why
i thought you were an expert on women
to the horse come on delilah
the camera pans down from the ceiling and we see that the inn is being decorated for christmas eve
everybody is so engaged except those actively helping phil and judy rehearse
the attitude is slightly cool on judys part but it is lovers coolness
fitting the action good judy
during the dancing now the same as the middle part
they make a nice couple with his arm around her waist dancing as one
he enters the room and watches
he looks intently at phil
phil and judy dance closer to bob
they see him
they continue dancing talking as they do
betty get off all right
slightly belligerent certainly
betty left something for you
she said to give it to you after she left
its on the piano
bob hears nods but keeps staring at phil
phil becomes conscious of the staring
whats the matter
i dont get it
dont get what
i just dont see it
you re skinny you got a big nose and you squint
nothing personal though
no of course not
im just trying to figure out what anyone sees in you
well stop worrying about it
when i ask you for a date just turn me down
come on judy
they dance away
bob crosses to the piano and picks up the package betty left for him
he opens it up and it is a single knitted sock the one she knitted on previously
he looks through the box for its mate
there is none
the camera moves closer to bob puzzled
painted at the top is the legend at the moment a hand is completing in chalk no snow after a moment the hand returns and draws two lines through the
s so that it now reads no now
camera pulls back to reveal we are on bob comes out of the post office and mounts a bicycle
he cycles down the street whistling a man chases a girl
there is a group of elderly men among them the hotel owners pitching horseshoes
waverly is sitting on a bench ruefully looking at the sign
starting a new game how about it waverly want to play
looking at him a moment im too young for that sort of thing
first owner laughs goodnaturedly and continues playing
bob rides into the scene and dismounts
bob sits into the shot
kind of warm for that kind of exercise isnt it
trying to help it isnt very warm
he looks to the sky i think the weathermans wrong about his forecast
those look like snow clouds to me
without looking up theyre cumulus clouds at an elevation of seven thousand feet
still trying still weathers a funny thing
it could snow overnight
he thinks a moment ill tell you something i havent told my family
im going back in the army
thats great news
i miss the army
where are you going to be sent sir
well im not sure yet
ive always been a combat officer but i got an idea theyre going to try and palm off one of the training commands on me
theyd better not
they just better not
hes worked up now im not ready for pitching horseshoes yet
he smiles now nothing to the women folk about this
lets mosey over to the post office im expecting a letter any day
remembering oh i beg your pardon sir
he pulls the letter out of his pocket thats what i came over to give you it slipped my mind
the general takes the letter he looks at it front and back
solemn this is the one
he opens it he squints
he looks to bob my glasses are in my room
id like to read it by myself but im a little anxious
he smiles at his own predicament read it son
reading dear tom why you dirty old he stops pleased skip that word
continuing it certainly was a surprise hearing from you
your amusing letter was appreciated more than you imagine
of course youve got plenty of time to be amusing sitting on that porch rocking away while we put in a full days work
you always were a lucky stiff and i envy you
a few years more i was saying to emmy the other evening and im going to be able to take it easy like old tom
just repeats old tom
oh well some people have all the luck
everyone in the family is fine here
carol had the mumps which is no joke at eleven years of age the rest of the letter is about the family
bob looks at him and then glances at the rest to see if it is so hes telling me they have nothing for me were not fooling each other
he holds has hand out thank you
bob gives him his letter
there is a pause
an attempt at being light say it couldnt be hard to learn to pitch horseshoes
now could it
trapped unhappy for him no sir
his nerve up begging your pardon sir theres a lot to be said for leisure
youre not used to it youve always been active but in time he stops seeing waverlys expression
waverly winks at him
quietly never kid a kidder
go on back to the hotel
waverly gets up to join the horseshoe players after all
bob watches this reflectively as we bob is packing his valise phil helping him
judy thinks my eyes are soulful
do you think my eyes are soulful
one of them is
you have no poetry in you
its about time you went in for girls too
after all you havent many years left for that sort of thing
bob his back turned to phil comes across the sock betty knitted for him he hastily shoves it into the bottom of has bag
over above im the quiet type
little do you know whats aged me
wheels within wheels eh
well live it up pops
eat drink and be merry is that why youre leaving for new york
i told you what im seein ed harrison about
glad to be rid of you
youre not in the girly mood
easily annoyed at the moment what do you know about girls
you wouldnt know what to do with a girl if she fell on you
well id know enough not to get up
there is a knock at the door and martha sticks her head in
wallace gonna miss your train
to bob for her id get up
as bob slams his suitcase shut a poster outside advertises the appearance of betty stewart
music is heard emanating from the club
a rehearsal is in progress in the deserted club
the chairs are up on the tables musicians in their shirt sleeves as betty sings a chorus of love you didnt do right by me
as she finishes the orchestra leader turns to her
betty you really live that number
the story of my life
shall we try it over again
meaningly i wish i could
it is alive with customers couples are dancing on the floor as a number ends
bob enters and is conducted to a ringside table by a maitre d
im expecting ed harrison
very well mr
betty is standing at the microphone ready to sing
she sees bob
the leader raises his baton
stopping him sotto lets not do the new number
play blue skies anything
just do it the way you sang it this afternoon youll be great
he gives the downbeat and betty has no choice but to sing love you didnt do right by me
she is assisted in the second chorus by a vocal group
as bob watches her
when she finishes the number betty steps down from the platform and joins bob
as bob holds the chair well surprise
what brought you to the big city
and dont say a train
forced gaiety hiding her tension i never heard you sing that well
thats a good number for you
her own significance some numbers suit you better than others
what are you doing here
meeting a fellow here
judy all right
couldnt be better
carefully playing footsie with phil
i think they like each other
i do too
eyeing her theyre kind of suited in a lot of ways
some people are
thanks for the knitted sock
dont mention it
i thought it was for phil
evenly if the sock fits wear it
unsure of her meaning it started out for phil
it just started out as a sock
every line of the sock exchange should have the meaning of the love implications
youre a very odd girl
youre a very odd fellow
bob is close to declaring himself if he was only sure of his ground
two feet one sock
i must be
ill get around to the other one eventually
you mean to do any knitting in the near future
the feeling comes and goes
think if the model hung around for a while
the feeling might be more permanent
bob leans over and takes her hand
whats this maybe shmaybe comes and goes
friends tell me i dont have many years left for this sort of thing
i ought to know right now if he is interrupted by ed harrison who has been brought to the table by the maitre d
how are you
he knows betty betty
she nods as ed sits down
to bob now whats this big deal you wanted to discuss
i shouldnt even talk to you after canceling out on my show
carefully ed i saw the old man
where in the pentagon
he owns a little hotel in a winter resort in vermont
our old man
nobody even knows who he is
hes too proud to let them know hes general waverly
ed looks at her surprised
to bob indicating betty was she in our outfit too
what are we going to do about it
you got a flash
got to stir it around a little
remember how old flintbottom always used to find a way to keep our morale up
without telling us
its about time we returned the favor
lets surprise him with a real big bang up reunion
now youre talking
how do we spread the word
bob takes a piece of paper out of his inside pocket and hands it to ed
youre gonna read this little speech on your television show
people look at it dont they
scanning the paper nows as good a time as any to find out
as he continues to read the piece of paper we phil is excited
bob just leave it to me
he wont get near a set if i have to break a leg
he opens the door of the booth and hurries across the lobby toward susan who is at the desk and bangs on the bell which is on the counter
martha comes running from the kitchen
excitedly now everybody pay close attention
ed is about to go on the air
bob is opposite him out of camera range the technical crew are watching the hand of the dial approaching
i hope phil has been able to keep the old man away from a television set
in anything involving something crooked hes dependable
seated around the television set are waverly martha and susan
martha and susan look at their watches and each other nervously
waverly also looks at his watch
ed harrison will be on in a half minute
i like him
i never miss him
the women are becoming very nervous
suddenly we hear off scene the most tremendous clatter dorm the stairway and phils shouting
jumping up whats that
he runs toward the stairs
martha and susan breathe a sigh of relief and follow waverly
waverly runs to the tangled phil
my leg is broken
take it easy boy
he starts feeling his leg ow
no it isnt
you may have a bad sprain but no bones are busted
its broken sir
i can feel it
let me help you
the technician indicates for ed harrison to start as the second hand hits straight up
i would like to address all former officers enlisted men wacs and nurses who were under the command of general tom waverly waverly and martha are helping phil through the
its broken in two or three places
thats just the impression you have
i tell you its only shock
the camera follows them into the office as they lay him out on the couch
laying him out take it easy boy
dont leave me
everything is going round and round
nobodys leaving you
martha get me a cold towel
the objective is pine tree vermont synchronize watches for operation waverly
phil has his eyes closed
things still going around
now theyre going sideways
waverly takes the wet towel from martha
now theyre going in and out
waverly slaps the towel on his face
thisll bring him out of it
sitting up where am i
hes all right
judy bursts into the room
phil whats happened to you
phil assumes a pain stricken face again and judy throws her arms around him
phil smiles over her shoulder at waverly
silhouette of busses station in background if desirable
two men with m
armbands slow up the busses
one is revealed to be phil
all quiet folks
entering the town
the old mans asleep
lets keep him that way
the busses move on
bob and betty tiptoe through the entrance to the inn
in the semidarkness of the lobby we hear a sst and susan and martha are revealed having been waiting for them
weve been waiting for you
how is everything going
they are bedded down in all the hotels
martha blows her nose
his old outfit
if i wasnt such a mean old biddy id probably break right down and cry
she cries theres nothing to cry about is there
he looks to susan and she begins to bawl
through the crying thank you so much
bob looks to betty for support
cant you do something
theyre just affected by the gesture
she cant hold it back either and now the three women are crying
through her tears where are judy and phil
probably in their rooms crying
they start out
as bob and betty turn around the corner they see phil and judy locked in an embrace
bob has been in front but he steps back quickly not wanting to embarrass the lovers
who is it
to bob we cant just stand here
we have to get some sleep
she walks into sight bob following
phil and judy break embarrassed
we were rehearsing for the show tomorrow night
is it going to be that kind of a show
well be raided
what are you doing here
what happened at the carousel
im helping out here tomorrow
everythings under control
fluster i mean with the show
weve got a lot of new material
you both are going to have to do a lot of rehearsing
flustered again i mean the other kind of rehearsing i mean rehearsing well good night judy
and he holds his hand out and they shake hands still flustered
good night phil
good night bob
to both good night
flustered the boys open the door to the girls bungalow thinking it is their own
lets get out of here before the gossip starts
they all laugh
the girls enter their bungalow and put on the light
the boys head toward their bungalow
phil enters in a gay mood
bob stops at the door turns around and looks toward the window of the girls bungalow
judy is getting into bed
betty in her dressing gown is looking out of the window toward the boys bungalow
bob is still pacing up and down on the porch
i think ill go out and see whats bothering him
thats how i started in canton ohio
this is vermont
nothing can happen here
keep your guard up
that aint coolidge out on that porch
betty throws her a look and exits
bob stands on the porch in robe and slippers thoughtfully puffing at his pipe
betty comes into scene
what are you doing
turning couldnt sleep
betty comes up on the porch
whatever youve got on your mind isnt worth staying awake for
where have i heard that
tell you how i handle a situation like this doctor
she starts to sing count your blessings
at the conclusion she walks away leaving him standing there
this sign announces the show opening
people are streaming into the inn
the general is in his dressing gown furious
martha and susan are playing a part
how could you send all my suits to the cleaners
youve only got two
why cant you wear your uniform
i wont appear in uniform
ill explain to bob and phil that you didnt care to come to the show tonight
ill have you court martialed
you dont mind being ungrateful you just dont like being told you are
follows it up if you think you dont owe them anything youre not obliged to go
they havent done much for you
you do what you think is right
angrily martha ill make my own decisions
i got along very well in the army without you
it took men to take my place
she stalks out
it is slowly filling up
one of the guiding officials turns out to be the sheriff we have previously seen
seating a party right this way
they are getting into their old uniforms which are slightly misfit
at the trousers this things shrunk
looking at the bulge pants always shrink in closets
i cant breathe in this
what am i going to do
i know what im going to do
showing him im going to take one big deep breath and thats going to be it for the next three hours
bob takes a deep breath and gets the top button buttoned
general waverly comes down the stairs cutting quite a figure in his uniform and decorations
martha and susan waiting for him at the bottom look him over admiringly
gruffly well i couldnt come down in my bathrobe
the spotlight prepared pinpoints the general as he enters the room and the music starts
the audience rises and applauds
he cant believe it
he reaches his table decorated with flowers and recognizes he is the guest of honor
from the lobby we hear the outfit singing the opening strains of the old man
all eyes turn to the lobby entrance through which the old outfit marches and continues to the stage and then back to their respective tables as the song finishes
he is profoundly moved and walks to the stage
the audience is seated
waverly looks at the assembled crowd with great affection
the people begin to shout speech
martha and susan sit
the crowd quiets waiting for the speech
he must have had a blood transfusion from a sergeant at some time i am not satisfied with the conduct of this division
some of you men are under the impression that having been at anzio entitles you not to wear neckties
you are wrong
neckties will be worn in this area
i have also noticed a deterioration in the quality of saluting
this is to be improved
i have also had complaints from the commanding officer of the rest area in naples
he informs me that the non fraternization rule is constantly being broken by men of this division
in fact this division is outstanding in its violations of non fraternization
you all know the rules
the non fraternization ban expressly declares you are not to talk to women
a slightly different tone dont talk to them
that is all
they howl and cheer
he makes has way toward his own table greeting old friends on the way
as they step to the front of the stage
to the audience doesnt that bring back memories
remember those terrible trying days in italy
when we had to beat the women off with chocolate bars
and wasnt it awful the way they kept bothering us for american cigarettes
why i must have taught fifty girls how to smoke
for a months pay all we got was million lira
nine hundred and fifty two
i was forced to hire a caddy for my loose change
im glad im well out of it
phil looks at him
who are we kidding
this is the cue for the orchestra to start the production number i wish i was back in the army
at end of number as they applaud and cheer
the old outfit is happy
in the exultation general waverly places two fingers to his lips and blows a whistle of sheer pleasure and approval
we underscore with music indicating another number is taking place on stage although we do not see it
ed harrison crosses to general waverly and whispers to him
long distance call for you sir
waverly looks surprised but rises and starts out
bob visible in b
has been watching
he and harrison exchange knowing glances
the lobby is empty in b
are the doors to the dining room where the show is in progress
the telephone lies on the counter
waverly enters and crosses to it
he is a little annoyed at being forced to leave the entertainment
into phone gruffly hurry up hurry up im busy
yes this is general waverly
he suddenly snaps to attention the old soldier
quietly and a merry christmas to you mr
yes practically the whole outfit is here
a little paunchy but theyre here
it certainly was a surprise more like a frameup
as usual my intelligence was not functioning efficiently
long pause thats very nice of you mr
any time you want me just say the word
but may i add this
it isnt always necessary to take a job
sometimes its enough just to know its there
through the window behind the general we have seen it begin to snow
the general notices it for the first time and his face brightens
if you ever take it into your mind to grab a little rest from all that work i wish youd drop in on us here i cant promise you any
golf but as he looks at the falling snow we can certainly give you plenty of snow mr president
smiles thanks ike
he hangs up the phone and proudly head erect he walks through the lobby smiling eyes wet
he lifts the bell on the desk with a loud bang
martha hurries in startled
you frightened me to death
that bell hasnt been used for three months
get this area policed up
no telling who might be dropping in
she and the general gaze at the snow falling beyond the lobby door which is blown open by the wind
underneath all this we have been hearing the introductory music to white christmas which is the number now in progress on the stage
waverly now turns and walks into the dining room
camera follows waverly on his entrance
as he passes susan we see she is reacting to something on the stage
camera passes waverly and moves to center stage there is a large cutout of a decorated christmas tree
also there is considerable christmas holly mistletoe etc
bob and betty are seen singing
throughout action of this number phil and judy dance
in addition there is staged movement by the ensemble
bob and betty are on each side of the cutout christmas tree but it is obvious that betty is preoccupied with some stage business which she is manipulating with one
hand behind the cutout tree
camera follows bob and betty as their movement takes them behind the tree
it is now that we see very clearly that the rear wall of the stage two immense barn doors has opened in b
we see the vermont countryside being covered by the falling snow
also we see pine trees in the snow that are decorated
betty steers bob to a point directly beneath a sprig of mistletoe from which is also hanging the mate to the sock she gave him in scene
bob looks up sees the mistletoe and the sock and smiles at betty
she lifts one of his trouser legs and we see that he is wearing the other sock
they laugh and embrace
the cutout tree onstage rises to the flies and now the real trees and falling snow in b
are completely visible
one by one the trees are lighted
martha and susan are standing happily beside the general each holding one of his arms
