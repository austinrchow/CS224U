of my latest affliction

vada emerges from the building and gets on her bike so whatd he say was wrong with you
vada is turning and beginning to ride away the whole medical profession is a crack
thomas j is trying to catch up hey wait up for me
vada slows down stops and looks at a person on a ladder painting a house hey look

vada accelerates leaving thomas j in her tracks dont pee on the hydrant
vada puts a record on to play
song is wedding bell blues she then opens a drawer and picks up a class photograph with mr
bixler enhaloed in a heart shape
music begins to play and vada sings along the first few bars whilst looking at the photo longingly excuse me harry i finished mr

she sees vada lying down sprawled out on the floor harry whats wrong with her
oh shes just pretending
vada get up here and eat your broccoli
shelly moves over and crouches down next to vada very sick sounding voice i think its my prostate
all of a sudden grammoo begins to sing i got rhythm i got music i got my man who could ask for anything more
i got daisies in green pastures i got my man who could ask for anything more
as this is being sung shelly slowly looks up with a very weird expression this is too much for her shelly exits house and closes door behind her and then
crouches down beside vada and thomas j whos winning
as vada and thomas j continue to play three vada aged girls come up to the end of the sultenfuss driveway look theres vada and her little boyfriend very mocking

n g first comes love then comes marriage then comes thomas j in a baby carriage
judy wanders off screen looking sorry for vada you know vada you shouldnt let those girls upset you

i only surround myself with people who i find intellectually stimulating
thomas j looks at shelly and smiles he is proud to be the friend of such an intelligent girl to vada want a piece of chocolate
vada shakes her head thomas j
im allergic to it
hes allergic to everything
shelly notices a ring that vada is wearing on her right index finger ooh thats a pretty ring youre wearing
its a mood ring it tells what mood im in
it doesnt work it always stays black
note ring is black its only black when youre around cause you put me in a bad mood
maybe black means youre happy
i dont think so
pause shelly how can i get thirty five dollars
shes crazy she wants to go to school over the summer
its not a real school its a writing class i wanna be a writer
she only wants to do it because her sweetie pies the teacher
vada is annoyed that shelly now knows her little secret and pushes thomas j shut your big fat mouth
i think youd make a fine writer did you ask your dad
he wont give it to me
well you dont know that
vada passes grammoo and harry who are watching a tv show she then seats herself next to harry daddy can i have thirty five dollars
thats a lot of money for a little girl
its for school for summer writing class
engrossed with tv show any more soda left
vada pours harry another soda shelly thinks id be a good writer
last month you wanted to play the violin
then you wanted to be a ventriloquist
harry keeps his gaze fixed the entire time upon the tv screen dad
referring to tv i love this guy
he laughs dad
ahh maybe next summer
he forgot about the time i wanted to be a magician i was really great at making myself disappear
no i gotta go to the cemetery keep your head up
dont look at the ball look at me
arthur grabs ball and begins to dribble it properly as a demonstration see
you were looking at the ball
keep your head up
gimme some skin they both give each other five i
slap each others hands arthur exits
vada continues bouncing the ball which accidentally veers off and goes down the stairs into the basement vada goes very slowly down the stairs and peeks round the corner she
is clearly very scared of the basement and the corpses contained in it she then rushes down and grabs the ball
as she turns around shelly who is upstairs walking through the house and sees the door ajar slams it shut unaware that vada is down there
vada runs up the stairs and tries to open the door she cant drops the ball and starts to yell out for help and bang on the it
shelly hears the noise and comes to the door
vada overcome with fear sits on a step covers her ears and begins to sing doo wah diddy diddy
shelly yanks the door open and sees vada crouched on the step vada
extremely frightened and timid my ball i lost my ball
picking vada up onto her feet come on sweetie
the two exit the scene excuse me harry
could you take a look at mrs
harry gets up from his desk moves over to mrs
porter and observes shellys work he looks unimpressed didnt i give you a picture of what she looked like
yeah searches pockets eventually pulling out a photo harry compares photo with mrs
porters face you dont like it
this was the reverend porters wife you have her looking like a two dollar hooker
a little offended i think she looks nice
her lips are very thin so i used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality and her eyes just needed a little definition and her hair im sorry
nobody wears this hairdo anymore in
this photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive
i just wanted to get past this old school marm image
that wasnt an image
she was an old school marm
beat fix it
harry begins to leave harry
harry stops and turns around i was just wondering if there is anything wrong with vada
what do you mean
well the other night at dinner
oh that she just likes to play
i dont think so i think shes confused about death
she was raised in a funeral home she knows a thing or two about it
harry i really think she
annoyed shes a perfectly happy eleven year old girl look dont give me any advice about my daughter okay
vada and thomas j stop turning the rope leaving phil standing there exhausted and run over to shellys camper shelly gets out hi
can we look around in your camper
ill give you the royal tour
vada and thomas j rush inside the camper surprised at vada and thomas js eagerness to get inside woah
thomas j seats himself at the drivers seat and makes vroom vroom noises vada sits at the table selects a book from a small bookshelf on the side and begins
to read it wow this is the coolest thing like you really eat and sleep here
im gonna drive us to liverpool
big ringo fan
would you like a soda
thomas uproots himself and sits opposite vada at the table what are you reading
vada makes a gesture at thomas j with her finger up to her lips implying that he should be quiet shelly notices vada reading the book oh
you shouldnt be looking at that its a little too old for you
she takes the book away from her did you read all these books
what are they about
mostly love and romance
theyre just fun to read
shelly hands the soda around here cheers
everybody takes a mouthful of drink are you married
no im divorced
daddy said its bad when people get divorced
well sometimes married people just find out they cant live with each other
mine arent divorced
thomas j gets up and reaches for the cookie jar shelly can i have a cookie
with bottle of soda in mouth hmmmph gurgle gurgle
thomas pulls out a few bank notes of largish denomination hey where are all the cookies
vada sees the money and the expression on her face shows she has an idea well i guess you found my secret hiding place
what are you saving for
nothing in particular just putting it away for a rainy day
cuckoo clock goes cuckoo
lunch time oclock im supposed to be home at noon for lunch thanks shelly
thomas j leaves bye
well miss vada what dyou say we head back
can i use your bathroom first
you dont have to wait daddyll be mad if youre late
shelly exits and vada enters toilet with a very guilty look on her face the great way is not difficult for those with no preferences with the absence of both
love and hate everything becomes clear and undisguised
that was written by a chinese philosopher in the year
now why would i choose to bring that up in a creative writing class
because the absence of judgment helps us to appreciate reality
in other words i want you to listen to your classmates writing with a clear and open heart okay
so whos gonna go first
i got one
he gets up i sang a song for you to hear i painted a picture for you to see i picked a rose for you to smell i planted grass
for you to touch but you did not hear my song you did not see my picture you did not smell my rose and you did not touch my grass
woman maybe she was outta town
thats not funny his poem is about futility we toil in unrewarded obscurity
now i hear judgment lets not forget the part about the open heart
the door at the back of the room opens and vada enters holding a writing pad and pen looking nervous vada is there something i can do for you
very nervous i paid the money
for this class
uh huh i wanna be a writer
vada this is an adult writing class
hey i think its real beautiful
she wants to be a writer
vada you sure you wanna do this
vada nods her head welcome to the class go find a seat
the class applauds okay ahh whos next
i experienced something with my boyfriend the other day and i wrote a few words down
the floors yours ronda
he covers me like a blanket from the cold dark night as i look into his eyes i know its right to touch to feel i know hes real flesh
all a mush flesh all a mush i cant fight it theres no point i wake up in lighter joint
several looks glance around the room
vada raises her hand uhhh va uhh vada
i wrote a poem too
loads of ice cream by vada sultenfuss i like ice cream a whole lot it tastes good when days are hot on a cone or in a dish this would
be my only wish vanilla chocolate or rocky road even with pie a la mode
thats all i got so far
i hear that vada flesh all a mush or rocky road its about desire
its very sweet and it rhymes and thats also good but youre not expressing to me whats in your soul
i want you to show me how you see the world your fears your desires your innermost secrets
my fears and secrets
im afraid i killed my mother
shelly gets up smiling when she hears the music and proceeds to the living room shelly pokes her head in the door to see harry playing a tune to grammoo
on his tuba sung to grammoo can not do without harrys wild about me
excuse me harry im sorry i just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered
and the rooms all set up
thanks listen i wanna apologize for the other day downstairs about vada i was a little harsh
i shouldnt stick my nose in other peoples business
its just that i like vada very much
after my wife died grammoo moved in here to help take care of vada
they were very close but lately as her minds been wandering more and more vadas been acting kinda crazy
im sure shell snap out of it though
im sure she will
nothings biting today

thomas js reel begins to click thomas j you got something
he jumps down from the tree hurry

thomas j reels the fish in hes only tiny throw him back
i dont like touching fish how do you pull the hook out without touching it
thomas j puts his foot on the fish and pulls youre hurting him dont kill him
the hook is out of the fishs mouth and sitting on the pier vada then removes the hook from the fishs mouth minor error in film and in the process
pricks herself ouch
vada puts the fish back im bleeding did he get away
thomas j looks and sees the fish dead floating on top of the water yeah he got away
come on lets go
hey we can become blood brothers
naah i dont wanna
you could pick that scab on your arm
its a mosquito bite
if i do it can we go
thomas j picks the scab on his arm which begins to bleed okay rub them together
they rub their cuts together now were blood brothers for life
oh hi what can i do for you
nothing i was just wondering what you were doing
oh im just typing up a funeral notice you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually its a service we provide for the family
oh right right she picks up the newspaper
bader lorenzo died june devoted husband to nicolette
cherished father of babritzio and heidi in lieu of flowers please send donations to the holy names society
i wrote that
harry gives shelly a matter of fact look oh its good in lieu of i love that word lieu
i prefer it to instead it has more dignity
its no big deal
you have to learn how to take a complement
shelly turns the newspaper over movies movies ahhhh love story at the drive in i cried my eyes out did you see it
i havent been to the movies in ages
i love going to movies especially at the drive in
i dont think theres anything more romantic than going to the drive in
subtle hint ill let you get back to work
shelly begins to exit with a look of failure on her face i do enjoy playing bingo if youd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church
youre welcome to
considers for a moment okay
harry resumes typing hi vada
are you going out somewhere
so how come youre putting lipstick on
a girls always gotta look her best
i think lipstick looks fake no ones lips are that color
have you ever tried any
come here sit down
vada enters bathroom and sits down on the closed toilet seat shelly brings up a stool and sits down in front of vada
vada gets some lipstick put on her now first we blot
vada blots her lips on some tissue take a look
i think it looks real nice on you
vada looks in shellys mirror shelly do you think im pretty
yes vada i think youre very pretty
youve got these great big sparkling eyes the cutest little nose an amazing mouth
the boys at school dont think i am
theyll come around
close your eyes i wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them
the first rule in applying eye makeup is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow
do you like putting makeup on people
uh huh ive been trying to get out to hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars i havent gotten there yet
she finishes her work all right open your eyes
vada opens her eyes and looks in the mirror shelly i would definitely hold off on that hollywood thing
your lip bleeding
whats wrong with your eyes
a girl can never wear enough eye shadow
wheres your bike
oh in the garage
walk me over
the two enter the garage where a large black hearse is parked its only a garage come on
vada notices that one of her streamers on her bike is gone hey one of my streamers is gone
it probably fell off in here
thomas j walks over to a model of a head hey look at this
that was grammoos
its a phrenology chart they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not
come here ill diagnose your head
no i dont wanna
come on its fun
vada examines thomas js head and then compares it with the chart hmmmm interesting
you have no personality
hey where does it say that
thomas j knocks the lid off a small box and reveals a photo is that your dad
whos that with your dad
its my mother
do you remember her
grammoo said shes in heaven
what do you think its like
i think everybody gets their own white horse and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day and everybodys best friends with everybody else when you play sports
theres no teams so nobody gets picked last
but what if youre afraid to ride horses
it doesnt matter cause theyre not regular horses they got wings and its no big deal if you fall you just land in cloud
that doesnt sound so bad come on well never find that streamer
as they leave vada turns back and grabs the photo then returns to thomas j the tune moonglow is playing on the radio well well well whats going on in
nothing im dressing
oh youre dressing uh huh harry harry harry harry dont you know its not nice to lie to your big brother
phil then proceeds to give harry a noogie phil stops im going out with shelly
oh yes oh thats great
im very nervous
the last date i had was twenty years ago
harry harry sit down let me fill you in on todays women since the last time you dated something happened the sexual revolution now before that you used to have
to hold a door open for a woman pull her chair out pick up the check no more no more you wanna know what else is missing
oh come on
harry im serious trust me harry this womans lifting us in you gotta treat her like every tom dick and harry

oh im running late
shellyll be here any minute
oh shes picking you up good youre on the right track

harry runs down the stairs and passes vada on the way goodnight vada
dad why are you dressed up to go to bingo
ahh i just wanna look nice
you never cared before
well shellys coming over were gonna go together
she likes to play bingo
can i go too
naah i think youd better stay here and keep grammoo company
harry leaves and then vada makes a decision she goes out the door vada approaches the sennets house and signals through the window for thomas j to come outside which
he does vada
where are you
vada springs up from her hiding place here
dont do that
what do you want
my mom will skin me alive if she finds im out here
lets go to the church theyre playing bingo tonight
i told you ill get in trouble
i am not
i stopped that
dont worry theres a strategy to bingo
for instance on a given night anybody can win but i play the odds when choosing bingo cards i use a range of theories from the laws of probability to
avoiding duplicate number systems
this way you get much more activity
hopeful does it make it easier to win
just more activity
harry then pulls a seat out and sits down in it cutting shelly off who has to pull her own seat out and sit down as he sits down to
the person next to him hi carl
vada and thomas j are walking up to the church theyre not gonna let us in vada were kids
were not gonna bet were just gonna watch
i dont even like to play bingo
vada and thomas j are ducking behind a counter on one side of the church harry and shelly are quite clearly visible on the other side of the room in
the distance as a number is announced oh great
hey theres your dad and shelly
ssshhhhh i dont want them to see me
in the distance again as another number is announced aarrggh
as shelly looks around the bingo table she notices that everyone around her is chronologically advantaged in a big way i just had a terrible thought harry
im gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon
why dyou think these seats were empty
can we go yet
you know im not allowed outside my myself after dark
oh im just not lucky harry
look its not always luck i mean depending upon the placement of the numbers a guy with cards could win just as easily as a guy with
kinda like men
oh how do you mean
you can be in a room with men and not like any of them or you can be in a room with just one man and hes exactly the one
harry and shelly are about to kiss each other vada sees this and doesnt look too happy about it in semi deep fake voice we have a winner
will the winner please raise their hand
there was no bingo it came from outside
how could someone outside get a bingo
someone outside didnt get a bingo someone outside yelled bingo you moron
who are you calling a mowon
false teeth put a lid on it vernon
put a lid on it
if you werent years old id kick your wrinkled arse
the two old men then have a fight harry attempts to break it up hey fellers fellers its just a bingo game
meanwhile shelly has found it all rather amusing we can go now
vada and thomas j run off down the street as she hears harrys car approaching she goes to her window and looks out it through the venetian blinds harry gets
out of his side comes round to the other side and then hesitates before deciding to follow his brothers advice and let shelly get out herself which she does eventually i had a good time tonight
i havent had a bingo partner in ages
they walk up to shellys camper would you like to come in and see my house
just for a minute
they enter vada continues to watch them from her room home sweet home
i did it myself
i read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces
well it certainly looks bigger that it seems
you can look in the bathroom if you want
people are always curious about that like what happens when you flush
harry moved toward the back of the camper and looks in the bathroom and then flushes the toilet yeah
are you mad at me
i dont know tonight you just seemed a little cool not opening car doors and
oh that was phil trying to give me advice on dating s women
look im so out of touch i havent dated women in ages not since my wife died
what happened to her
ahh complications during child birth she died two days after vada was born
did she ever see vada
i brought the baby into the room a couple of times she opened her eyes yeah yeah i think she saw vada
harry looks at the item that he picked up and was fiddling with to calm his nerves did i ruin this
dance with me
this is where we are
is there enough room
shelly moves an object from the floor which creates more room i havent danced in
in ages i know me neither
they begin a slow dance rock
see youre not that out of touch
they dance youre good
at widdman high i was considered a pretty hot date i did a killer frugue
shelly smells harrys neck what are you wearing
old spice phil says its a timeless classic
they continue to dance do you want to
want to what
they then have a long kiss good at kissing and dancing im very optimistic
they then kiss again this time interrupted by the clock cuckooing i ahh better go
its only eight oclock
harry exits the camper followed by shelly who stands at the door well i guess its official we had a date maybe we can play bingo again sometime
im tired of bingo maybe we should try that drive in of yours
harry waves vada finishes watching and goes to bed before the class started ronda and justin wanted to lead the class in a group meditation
ooooh thats really cool
okay what were gonna do is send our vibes out into the group
justin turns on some kind of tape deck which begins to play weird music everybody hold hands and close your eyes
relax your muscles and take deep breaths
now try to feel what the other person is feeling without speaking any words send out your vibe and receive the vibes around you at the same time
can you feel it
okay open your eyes
what did everybody feel
i felt mrs
i can feel that ronda is one with the earth shes so cosmically in tune
so right on thats exactly what i sent out and i felt like you were full of inner peace and harmony
vada what did you feel
i felt justins hangnail
no vada thats not what were looking for a hangnail is insignificant
whats in my soul feel my aura
i dont think im allowed to
i tell you what lets try it again hold hands
grammoo once had a hangnail on her big toe
it got infected and traveled to her vocal chords it ruined her singing voice i dont think grammoo thought it was insignificant
vada gets out of bed and goes down corridor to see grammoo she seats herself cross legged next to grammoo on her bed and takes her hands in an attempt
to do some spiritual healing lettuce watch out for the rust when you get lettuce
suddenly shelly appears behind them and calls out hey i thought i recognized you two hi vada
im just picking some things up for the barbecue
yeah me too mind if i tag along
not at all
lot of potatoes
its for shellys famous potato salad
im looking forward to that
vada who is pushing the shopping trolley behind harry and shelly obviously does not like the idea of harry shelly and she rams her cart into harry hey ouch damn
vada watch what youre doing
you know this is gonna be my first th of july picnic in a long time
picking up large can of prunes dad didnt you say you needed prunes real bad
ahh vada just put anything you want in the cart anything at all
to shelly i dont know whats gotten into her today
vada begins to throw cans of every description from the shelf into the shopping trolley at regular intervals not giving a stuff what they contain i used to like to
play with my ken and barbie dolls ken was my favorite
then one christmas i got them a camper and all they wanted to do was hang out in it by themselves
so i wasnt too upset when they took that wrong turn and went over a cliff
harry harry harry harry harry i told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what youve done
youve cremated them
thats what i do
do you wanna do it
no no no
look if you think you know how why dont you pre measure the briquettes in little packages put out a product support me for a while
phil exits scene shelly comes up behind harry hows it going chef
vada is seen turning her head to look at harry and shelly she doesnt like harry and shelly standing so close together she decides to make her move and pushes
in between harry and shelly are they ready yet
no sweetie not yet
shelly begins to brush vadas hair with her fingers which vada does not like and she shakes her head to get shelly off when
soon honey soon
shelly again tries to fix up vadas hair which there doesnt appear to be anything wrong with and vada shakes her off again when
in a minute look its hot sweetie youll burn your nose look out
vada backs off followed by shelly rub a dub dub thanks for the grub yay god
ill second that
hey shelly like seafood
uh huh why
vada opens her mouth and displays half chewed bbq cuisine to shelly laughing thats attractive
shellys glance moves to behind grammoo on the other side of the table and beyond where the two men are standing looking around under her breath oh shit
shelly gets up and moves off to talk to the men vada and phil turn so they can see what is going on harry can already see grammoo just sits
staring into space hey shelly who lives here

danny what are you doing here

what am i doing here
to other man in background hi ralph
oh danny howd you find me here

scene shifts to vada phil and harry for a moment these two people do not have a good relationship
in background no
i bought it i paid for it
scene shifts back to close up of shelly and danny arguing ive been living in it for over a year the camper is mine
excuse me mutual asset thats what the lawyer said its supposed to be our mutual asset not shellys recreational vehicle
gimme the keys
keep your voice down
the boss is watching us
sarcastic im impressed

shelly and danny walk over to the table where the rest of the family are seated ralph follows close behind talking to danny pointing at the people respectively this is
harry phil grammoo and vada sultenfuss
matter of fact i like my name
to the sultenfuss this is danny and ralph they own the dino raphael salon in detroit
pointing at danny we used to be married
extremely hopeful to danny are you here to take shelly back
danny shakes his head at vada then harry gets up and walks round the table uhh its nice to meet ya
uhh we got burgers and hot dogs here if youd care to join us
cant stay im just here because my wife
shelly quickly interjects ex
my ex wife seems to have ripped off my camper
honestly harry he got the mustang i promise
i dont think so i got a copy of the property settlement right here
danny pulls out a piece of paper ahh shit this is my lease
damn it i keep forgetting things im getting senile
okay i know youve suffered a terrible loss and theres really nothing anyone can do to comfort you but i urge you to focus on the times you had with
the camper the trips you took the sights you saw those days are gone now but theyll live on in your heart forever
to shelly this guy bonking you
disgusted danny thats a real bonehead thing to say
to danny look youre not gonna take shellys camper
its her home
its where she lives
oh really okay fine look go cook to shelly gimme the goddam keys
danny tries to grab the keys from shelly stop it
harry is now very annoyed danny
as harry says danny for a second time he plants his fist in dannys stomach with force winding him and shutting him up whatd you do that for
who are you
im his brother
oh then youll probably be visiting us here quite often
because if he ever tries to take shellys camper again im gonna bury him in my front yard
ralph looks rather disturbed by this quiet voice to vada your father is a savage
vada looks up at phil phil looks back and nods bye ralph
the car with danny and ralph in it pulls away and shelly waves to harry well you were pretty great
is it really your camper
shelly makes gesture with her right hand suggesting sort of suddenly a sky rocket screams up in the sky and then explodes harry and shelly look up and watch the
fireworks can we see it from the back yard
you can get the general idea
they move off to the back yard
yep there they are
they always look the same every year
pointing upwards look
did you ahh love him
i would never marry anybody i didnt love
he must like shelly i never saw him hit anyone in his life
he likes her
does he love her
do you like her
yes i do and i think shes very good for your father
after your mother died he was sad all the time but before that he was pretty funny
now when i see him with shelly sometimes he seems like the old harry
my dad was funny
well he wasnt one of the marx brothers but he made me laugh
my uncle fought in the korean war he had a steel plate put in his head daddy said he didnt come back the same one night he picked up a
radio station from oklahoma in his teeth it was really neat
with stick in mouth carnnk yu sheeee ik
welty removes stick from vadas mouth cant you see it
vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat
vada looks at the dr
s certificates up on the wall dr
welty are you sure those are yours
so you fill it with water like this and what have you got
a water gun
cool can i get one for vada
oh yes yes
she gets another one out of her drawer thomas let me ask you a question
does vada ever tell you why she comes down here so much
cause shes dying
do you think she is
why do you think she says that
cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house and you know that saying if you cant beat em join em well if shes one of them
she wont be as scared
you know what i think
i think vadas very lucky to have a friend like you
nurse randall hands thomas j another syringe shes my best friend
the door to the doctors surgery opens and vada exits miss vada how are you feeling
as good as can be expected
hey vada guess what we got
thomas j begins to run and as he passes vada he squirts his syringe at vada squirt squirt im gonna get you
squirt ill get you
vada at this point is unarmed and she chases thomas j down the stairs suddenly thomas j stops in his tracks woah
pointing theres a beehive right there
thomas j stands a pace back behind a branch on the tree and begins to squirt the beehive are you crazy youll get stung
youre right lets knock it down
what do you want it for anyway
for their meat
the two start throwing rocks at the hive which gets damaged and eventually falls to the ground got it
my mood ring
it fell off
i gotta find it
they begin to search for vadas mood ring suddenly bees begin to swarm luckily thomas j notices in time theyre alive
run for your life
vada just stands there looking thomas j comes back and grabs her arm this wakes her up and they begin to run run faster theyre after us
i am running faster
they have run to the spot with the weeping willow and the pier they run out on to the pier jump in the water
but i have my clothes on
in the distance from upstairs vada is that you
hey guess what

vada likes this news she hurries up the stairs shellys coming with us
vada is now not so happy so vada whats your favorite ride

i dont think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach

hot dogs and the next day they came down with nephritis
its a kidney disease you dont get it from hot dogs
well im no doctor

they baffled medical science they were in a magazine
vada and harry give shelly a yeah right look they were
popular mechanics no popular science

oh look theyre trying to hit that poor thing
watch you dont knock out a fish
i dont know which balls mine
vada gets a ball in a bowl i won i won
hooray we have a winner picks up fish in plastic bag there you go little girl
gives fish to vada see how easy it is folks
shelly inspects fish holding it along with vada oh vada thats a gorgeous goldfish
vada notices something on shellys hand whered you get that ring
all of a sudden shelly looks up with a guilty look extremely hopeful did you win it
harry and shelly exchange looks harry smiles followed by shelly vada we have something to tell you
harry sits down on table and looks at vada in a matter of fact way vada we have some good news shelly and i are getting married
vadas expression begins to change from hopeful to horror but then she drops her fish oh my fish
vada quickly bends over to pick up the fish were having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer
not acknowledging harrys comment youll be okay little fish
would you like us to get you another goldfish
less angry talking to fish fish are very resilient animals you know
dont worry i wont get another fish
shelly and harry exchange worried looks vada doesnt seem to have understood oh bumper cars oh you cant go to a carnival and not ride the bumper cars
i fall asleep at the wheel
malicious grin ill ride on the bumper cars with you
oh great vada come on
they run off leaving harry to carry the teddy bear and the fish to the attendant uhh two
to vada i got the blue one
vada runs in past shelly and seats herself in a car yes
shelly gets in the blue one pointing at vada i am gonna get you
vada straps herself in shelly turns around and gives vada the thumbs up vada looks very intent on brutally murdering something now and she returns the thumbs up as she
does so music begins to play and the power is turned on the song is bad moon rising vada keep your hands on the wheel
vada rushes straight at shelly and rams into her at top speed so that shellys car is spun around a little shelly screams this is all in good fun at
then vada rams her again and again and again and again and eventually shelly does not look too pleased she cant escape vada careful vada careful
shelly look out
shelly and vada pull up along side each other vada gives shelly a satisfied but still spiteful grin vada rings the sennetts doorbell and mrs sennett answers hi vada
hi can thomas j come out

thomas j stops and then does vada thats it
thomas j goes and sits down on the river bank vada follows with an annoyed look get up

vada sits down next to thomas j why are you running away
my dad gave shelly a ring

he likes her better than me
im hungry i cant last any longer

thomas j climbs down from tree and leaves vada jumps down and we can now see that the tree was on the sultenfuss front lawn as soon as vada has
entered she waits for someone to come running and ask her if shes all right where shes been they were so worried etc
nothing happens all she can hear is the noise that the tv is making
so she opens the door again and slams it
she decides to give up and go find harry she walks to the living room where the tv is on harry and grammoo are asleep in their chairs vada begins
to ascend the stairs depressed in social studies we learned some people stole the limburg baby right out of his house i think ill sleep with my window open tonight
vada bursts out of the bathroom and screams down the stairs daddy
vada runs into a room where shelly is daddy
vada vada whats the matter
well he just left whats wrong

very weak scared voice i dont want i dont need your help
vada tries to run away but shelly stops her vada did this happen in the bathroom
vada nods her head how old are you
im eleven and a half
its okay come on upstairs we have to have a little talk
they exit my mommy and daddy did that
its actually a very beautiful thing and look there wouldnt have been a vada

door bell is heard ringing oh thats probably thomas j i dont wanna see him

nothing happens to boys
hi vada can you come out
please its real hot maybe we can go swimming
vada is angered by this she comes storming out vada pushed thomas j hard enough to make him fall over she is angry get outta here
and dont come back for five to seven days
vada runs inside and slams the door leaving poor thomas j sitting on the porch looking startled grammoo im going to the bathroom ill be right back
she then gives grammoo a little kiss and makes her way out of the living room to the bathroom closing the door behind her as she goes to enter the
bathroom she hears giggling coming from the next room so she goes to investigate
harry and shelly are kissing and giggling
as she is watching this grammoo gets up enters the funeral room and makes her way to the front when she gets there she picks up a rose takes a
look at the dead man and begins to sing into the rose as if it were a microphone its quarter to three theres no one in the place just you and me
as this is being sung vada hears and turns around with an oh shit look on her face harry and shelly also hear it and make off for the funeral
room vada quickly retreats into the room where harry and shelly were closing the door behind her so santa macho i got a little story you oughtta know were comin my friend to the end of a brief episode so make it one for my baby and one more for the road
im so sorry its all right ma im very very sorry
grabs vada by the shoulders now what were you thinking huh
its your responsibility to watch her
do you have any idea how upset those people are in there
vada breaks free from harrys grip and walks briskly out of the room
shelly looks back at harry expectantly why do you think people want to get married
well when you get older you just have to
im gonna marry mr
you cant marry a teacher its against the law
it is not
yes it is cause then hell give you all as and it wont be fair
nervously uncertain have you ever kissed anyone
like they do on tv
maybe we should just to see whats the big deal
but i dont know how
here practice on your arm like this
vada brings her forearm up to her mouth and starts to kiss it thomas j follows like this
they kiss their arms for a while okay enough practice
close your eyes
but then i wont be able to see anything
vada raises her fist just do it
okay on the count of three
two and a half
vada leans forward and kisses thomas j on the lips they both look surprised vada then sits back against the tree long pause say something its too quiet
umm ummmmm agitated just hurry
thomas j stands up and begins to say something along the lines of
on political agents to the flag of the united states of america vada stands up and joins in and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god
individual with liberty and justice for all
when they finish they both still look a little uncomfortable you better not tell anyone
you better not either
well lets spit on it
both of them raise their hands to their mouths and spit on them they then shake hands and when finished wipe them off on their trousers seeya tomorrow
vada starts off down the road vada
would you think of me
well if you dont get to marry mr
vada smiles and gets on her bike i guess
as vada rides off thomas j smiles thomas j comes across the beehive inspects it and then kicks it he waits and then once he is adamant that there is
no danger he begins to search for vadas mood ring he searches and as he does so bees begin to swarm he finds the mood ring and by the time he notices that there are bees everywhere it is too late
as he finds the mood ring yes
reacting to the bees ow ahh no
we see thomas js glasses fall off onto the ground a policeman enters takes his hat off and explains what has happened to thomas j to harry who becomes clearly
very distressed hi vada
what are you doing
feeding my fish
is that the fish you won at the carnival
hes getting big
sad pause vada come here and sit down for a minute
vada sits down next to her dad vada something happened to thomas j last night he stepped on a beehive
beginning to look worried i told him not to tease those bees
did he get stung
harry nods maybe i should go over and yell at him
no sweetheart you cant
looking very worried why not
he was allergic to bees
extremely worried hes okay isnt he
shakes head near tears there were just too many of em
when vada hears this her eyes begin to flood with tears and the expression on her face changes movingly it looks as though she just lost the most special and
important part of her life
and she has dr
vada whats wrong sweetheart
i cant breathe im suffocating
oh wait relax now let me look let me look come up here and well have a look
welty lifts vada up onto bed it hurts it hurts so bad make it stop

view shifts to inside vadas bedroom where she is curled up in a little ball on her bed im leaving some food for you by the door in case you
vada remains where she is the doorbell rings hi
hi is vada home
yes she is but shes very upset so shes not seeing anyone
oh im judy i go to school with her i wanted to tell her im sorry about thomas j

shelly closes the door hi harry
ahh reverand miles
the sennetts want to thank you for taking care of things so quickly
i see you took your tray in vada is looking out her blinds at all the black cars and people dressed in black entering her house maybe you should come
down for the funeral sometimes it helps
she wont come out
its been a whole day
you have to do something harry
the funerals starting
shelly is now very emotional open your eyes shes eleven years old
her only friend in the world is dead
i know that but what do you want from me
stop hiding harry you run harry
when i first came here the idea of working with dead people didnt exactly thrill me but when i saw a family lived here i thought if im living without
a family at least i can work with one and maybe once in a while ill be invited in for supper
yeah and when those suppers are disrupted because theres a car crash or theres a fire or a little boy steps on a beehive
im not asking you to stop feeling for those people
but life isnt just death harry dont ignore the living especially your daughter
arthur enters excuse me harry shelly the ministers about to begin
thank you arthur
shelly exits we are here to honor thomas james sennett
he was born may in madison pennsylvania and he was survived by his loving parents charles and susan sennett
fades as camera changes the minister is heard to say this in the background the family has asked me to say a few words before we proceed
no words that i could say would begin to describe the loss and grieving one word that keeps ringing in my ear is why
why would god choose to take this little boy from us
i cant give you an answer to that question but i can tell you that god has chosen thomas j for some very special reason we must find solace in
knowing that thomas j is now in gods care
in that face there is no sorrow such as
the ministers words fade into the very moving music vada stops and sits on a step where she can look through and see thomas j lying in his coffin she
begins to cry disciples began to chastise them and jesus said let the children come to me do not hinder them for the kingdom of god belongs to such as these
the minister notices vada coming around the front of the room he laid his hands on their heads before he left that place let us pray in silence
vada has made it right up to the coffin which she leans over and crying says the following wanna go tree climbing thomas j
his face hurts and where is his glasses
he cant see without his glasses
put his glasses on
harry and shelly are rapidly approaching vada shelly takes hold of her and tries to pull her away put on his glasses
he was gonna be an acrobat
hes gone sweetheart
get away get away
vada breaks away from harrys grip and runs out of the room followed closely by harry and shelly vada wait
harry stops running after vada as she sprints off down the road vada arrives at mr
bixlers house vada
i was just on my way to your house

im so sorry about thomas j
vada covers her ears and begins to sing doo wah diddy diddy okay okay we dont have to talk about him vada vada we dont have to talk about him

crying justin and ronda say that i should tell people what i feel
nods come here sit down over here
the two of them sit down on mr
bixlers porch vada is clearly in a lot of pain and she wants it to stop mr
bixler emotional pause i love you

vada pulls out her photo of her mother whos that with your dad

vada gets into bed and extends her arms to shelly they hug each other vada has finally accepted shelly goodnight
shelly exits and turns off the lights sitting on stairs shes in
harry enters walks over and kisses vada then turns around and begins to exit did i kill my mother
the bees killed thomas j and i killed my mother

vada pulls out the photo of harry and vadas mom from under her pillow i found this
i forgot about that picture where did you find it
in the garage
ahh that little chevy was your mothers favorite car

you know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you
she came home and painted this whole room pink
she was so sure she was gonna have a little girl
do you miss her
yes i did very much for a long time and even now i get a little sad when i think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother

sennett looks at harry as if to say good bye and then walks off slowly mrs
she stops and turns around to look at vada thomas j will be all right my mother will take care of him

vada gives justin a hug she then proceeds towards mr
bixler i was hoping youd stop by today
vada and mr
