written by danny rubin second revision by harold ramis january a family of groundhogs is nestled together in their burrow sleeping off the end of a long winter
the crust of an old snowfall still covers the frozen ground and the bare icy branches of the trees glisten dully in the early morning light
phil connors is standing in front of a blank green wall gesticulating animatedly at some invisible images on the wall talking a mile a minute mos
he looks completely crazy as he points at nothing and winks to an unseen audience
credits continue as we streak across the winter landscape flying over fields and farms small towns and hamlets railroad lines and interstates coalyards and factories until we cross the allegheny
river and follow it to the southwest
phil continues pointing out features on the blank wall but from a new angle we can see that he s looking at a monitor out of the corner of his
eye which shows the chromakey insert hes pointing to a national weather map
the country towns turn to suburbs traffic on the roads gets heavier and finally we see the skyline of pittsburgh and the confluence of the allegheny with the monongahela and
we zoom into a tall building in the downtown area and we dont see anyone at first but the office itself speaks volumes about its inhabitant team pictures of the
steelers from the franco harris terry bradshaw glory years a framed memorial portrait of roberto clemente a local emmy award statue an erasable weather map and mountains of personal junk on the desk windowsill and every other available surface
as the credits end we notice a sleeping figure on the small sofa buried deep under a pile of coats and a stolen airline blanket
gil hawley executive producer of the action news sticks his head in the door
christ what a pit
phil the sleeping figure rouses himself and looks out at hawley
its phil the
channel action news weatherman
its february first phil
you know what tomorrow is
phil sits up and
hes in his mid thirties smart rugged looking perhaps a little too full of himself but clearly a guy with a lot of personality
catching on oh no
he jumps up and exits the office with hawley right behind him
im not going
hawley pursues phil through the office suite of the channel action news from the look of it a typical big city local news operation
a logo on the wall identifies the station as wpgh pittsburgh
phil ducks into the studio
hawley follows him in and catches up with him at the weather corner of the action news set
phil starts putting weather stats up on a chart
get away from me
so whats the outlook
we gonna get that blizzard
phil shakes his head and points to the chart which is headed phils phorecast with a cute caricature of himself drawn next to the title
all that moisture coming up from the gulf is going to miss us completely and take a dump on harrisburg
with authority good cause youre going up to punxsutawney to cover the groundhog story tomorrow morning and i want you back here in time to do the five
jesus gil give me a break will you
i covered the goddamn groundhog last year and the year before that
and youll do it next year and the year after too
when i worked in san diego i covered the swallows coming back to capistrano for ten years in a row
you shouldve killed the guy who made you do that
i wanted to do it
then you shouldve killed yourself
i dont want to get stuck with the groundhog for the rest of my life
its a cute story
he comes out he looks around he wrinkles up his little nose he sniffs around a little he sees his shadow he d oesnt see his shadow its nice
people like it
many people are morons
just do it
what you give me
hawley looks across the studio and sees rita hanson enter a very attractive segment producer in her late twenties
to phil ill give you rita
calls her over rita could you come here for a second
i got a little job for you
rita is relatively new to the station but very competent personable humorous self assured and very pretty in short a genuine princess though phil is too self absorbed at this
point to realize it
you cant send rita out on a story like this
shes just a cub a pup still wet behind the ears
look at her
her ears are sopping wet
this needs a woodward or a bernstein
its a big story
people need to know
whats the story
the punxsutawney groundhog festival
gil if its all right with you i d rather follow up on the nurses strike
you can do the nurses when you get back
just take the squeaky wheel here up to punxsutawney and get him back in one piece
hawley exits leaving phil and rita alone in the studio
she knows phil mainly by his reputation and it isnt good
still she finds him appealing in an odd way
you know this could be extremely interesting
ive never done a weather story before
whats punxsutawney like
oh its an enchanted place
a magical world
its the constantinople of the whole western appalachian susquehanna drainage system
do you always joke
about to of the time
inside im actually a very shy and sensitive person
a lot of people around here think youre not very sincere
tell me the names of these people
ill line up a crew and transportation
if you dont feel like driving we can all go up in the van together
i think ill take my own car
i m not that fond of my fellow man
calls after her why dont you ride up with me
stephanie decastro an attractive dark eyed dark haired correspondent glares at phil from across the studio
phil is in his cluttered cubicle talking on a headset phone while he reviews cassettes of his groundhog spots from the past two years on a small monitor
as he talks he stuffs a number of personal items in an overnight bag all the time watching himself on the tv monitor
on the phone they dont really think of me as a weatherman around here
more of a personality but with the credibility of a first class broadcast journalist
once you look at my tape i think youll see what they mean
stephanie enters and stands in the doorway looking at phil for a long moment
there is something vaguely off center about this woman not quite fatal attraction but still a little scary
i just want to know one thing did i do something wrong or are you just tired of me or what
i have to know
on the phone dan can i call you back
ive just been handed something and i better get on it
he picks up some papers and rustles them for effect okay thanks
he takes off the headset gets up and closes the door for privacy
you didnt do anything wrong stephanie and i m not tired of you
its just that i dont have time for a real relationship right now
i told you that the first time we went out
getting close everybody says that at the beginning of a relationship
gently pushing her im different
i really meant it
things are really starting to move for me now
i m not going to be doing the weather for the rest of my life
i was just talking to the cbs guy about a network job
i want that
this is just the beginning for me
i cant waste any more time
are you saying our relationship was a waste of time
we went out a total of four times
and only twice did anything happen
it was fun but i dont see that as a big commitment
closing in again i had our charts done
my astrologer says were extremely compatible
there may even be some past lives involvement here
so weve already done this
lets move on
you know whats wrong with you phil
you dont have time for anyone but yourself
thats what i m trying to tell you
you dont want to be with me
you can do better
look stephanie if i ever said or did anything to mislead you im sorry for that but right now i have to do this groundhog thing and i dont have
a handle on it yet
he throws some papers and his datebook into a briefcase and puts on his jacket
ill tell you what
i m going to do some serious thinking while i m in punxsutawney okay
he pats her on the shoulder and brushes past her leaving her standing there with a malevolent look on her face
a van marked
channel action news speeds along a two lane highway through the winter landscape of west central pennsylvania
mounted atop the van is a microwave transmitter
rita is riding up front with larry the union cameraman and techie
phil is following close behind the van in a new lexus coupe
his car has a bumper sticker that reads weathermen like it wet
on his earphone im on my way to punxsutawney
forced to repeat it a little embarrassed punx su taw ney
work or fun
i think that all depends on you
phil is talking to one of his girlfriends sorting through a stack of cds as usual grabbing at the good life with both hands
i thought maybe you could meet me up there tonight and let me vulgarize you for about seven hours
so i m supposed to spend the night in punxsutawney all alo ne
phil loads a cd and a great driving song kicks in
welcome to punxsutawney the original weather capitol of the world since
depicted on the sign is a large cartoon groundhog wearing a top hat and clutching an umbrella under his arm
the mini convoy passes some fast food places on the outskirts of town
the van drives along the small town main drag
there are cartoon groundhogs everywhere you look and the whole town has been gaily festooned with banners and bunting
the van pulls into the parking lot at a quality inn
the announcement billboard in front of the motel reads groundhog day breakfast special feb
all you can eat
the parking area is already crowded with cars including a number of other news vans
the lexus pulls in behind the van and everybody gets out
phil takes one look at the motel and shakes his head
calls out rita
i cant stay here
rita is already helping larry unload equipment from the van
ill handle it
she crosses to the lexus where phil is trying to make another call on his earphone
whats the problem phil
i hate this place
i stayed here two years ago and i was miserable
its like a minimum security prison
im not staying here
youre not staying here
i m not
no larry and i dont care but i thought you might so i booked you at a very nice bed and breakfast on cherry street
heres the address
she hands him a card
thats the mark of a really good producer
making the talent happy
whatever i can do
will you be my love slave
whatever i can do within reason
would you like to have dinner with larry and me
no thanks ive seen larry eat
why dont you ditch larry and let me take you someplace nice
you mean like a date
i get it
youre a little intimidated by me youre all excited about the shoot tomorrow you want everything to go just perfect
you just get some sleep
tomorrow will be great
well thats something to look forward to
ill see you in the morning
he drives off leaving her standing there shaking her head
did he actually call himself the talent
larry snorts and continues unloading their gear
the first light of morning colors the sky behind the cherry street inn a rambling white victorian bed and breakfast
a digital clock radio changes from to am
the radio comes on playing the end of the sonny and cher hit i got you babe
phil sits up in bed and looks around the room
the decor is typical bed and breakfast flocked wallpaper framed prints and an odd assortment of mismatched furniture
his suit is hanging neatly on the back of the closet door and his suitcase is open on a stand at the foot of the bed still neatly packed
a iradio deejay and his sidekick come on with hyped up drivetime chappy talk
phil stares at the radio and listens to them
okay campers rise and shine and dont forget your booties because its cooold out there phil grimaces and swings out of bed
its cold out there everyday
w hat is this miami beach
the deejay laughs
phil shakes his head at the cheesy repartee as he crosses to the sink and starts brushing his teeth
and you can expect hazardous travel later today with that you know blizzard thing that blizzard thing
phil splashes some water on his face and prepares to shave
oh heres the report the national weather service is calling for a big blizzard thing
yes they are but theres another reason today is very special es pec ia lly cold especially cold okay but the big question on everybodys lips ch ap pe d
lips on their chapped lips right do you think phils going to come out and see his shadow
phil looks up at himself in the mirror admiring his own face
thats right rodent lovers
groundhog day sound effect of grunting groundhogs
phil grunts at his reflection in the mirror
to himself never again
phil heads for the breakfast room of the inn now well dressed in a suit and tie a nice overcoat slung over his arm
a chubby man passes
think itll be an early spring
i m predicting march st
phil enters the old library of the house now set up with a breakfast buffet
an old spinet piano stands in the corner
one wall is lined with
bookcases filled with books
a handful of guests are seated around the room eating
the matron of the house mrs
lancaster spots phil as she comes out of the kitchen with a fresh pot of coffee
did you sleep well mr
with mock civility like a roumanian orphan mrs
would you like some coffee
i dont suppose it d be possible to get an espresso or a capuccino around here
i dont really know forget it
this be fine
as she pours i wonder what the weathers going to be like for all the festivities
my guess is it be cold and overcast high today in the low s dropping to the low s tonight but im predicting that all that moisture coming up from
the gulf is going to miss us and dump some locally heavy snow possibly blizzard conditions with travel advisories in the harrisburg area and maybe as far east as
off her surprised you want to talk weather you asked the right guy
he heads for the door
oh will you be checking out today mr
sipping at the steaming coffee phil manages to put on his coat and gloves as he descends the front steps of the house and joins the flow of pedestrian traffic
on the street
there are a lot of people on the street for this hour
traffic is so heavy in fact the pedestrians are moving faster than the cars
everyone seems to be going in the same direction making the annual trek to see the groundhog
an old bum is sitting on the sidewalk leaning against a storefront
someone throws him a coin
phil walks by without taking any notice
a big pie faced man ned ryerson comes huffing and puffing right up to him
there is something about this guy that makes us dislike him on sight
i thought that was you
phil looks at him vaguely
at a loss i m sorry
have we uh my oh my
dont say you dont remember me cause i sure as heckrfire remember you
phil stares trying to remember
ned the head
come on buddy
case western high
i see you clicking through that brain of yours
click click c li ck cli ck click click bing
ned ryerson did the whistling trick with my belly button in the talent show
ned ryerson got the shingles real bad senior year almost didnt graduate
ned ryerson went out with your sister mary pat a couple of times til you told me not to anymore
so whatre you doing with yourself ned
phil i sell insurance
sorry he asked no kidding
do you have life insurance phil
cause if you do i bet you could u s e more who couldnt
but i got a feeling you dont have any
am i right
you know ned i d love to talk to you but i really have to phil starts to walk away but ned wont take the hint
ill walk with you
when i see an opportunity i charge it like a bull
ned the bull thats me now
some of my friends live and die by actuarial tables but i think its all just a crap shoot anyhoo
ever heard of single
that could be the ticket for you buddy
god its good to see you
hey whatre you doing for dinner
umm i dont think thats going to work for me
as they continue walking phil steps into what looks like a shallow puddle and ends up ankle deep in wet slush
ned laughs like a donkey
hey look out for that first step
its a doozy
phil looks at him with murderous contempt
a big crowd is standing in a park like clearing off a residential street
they are gathered around a large mound of dirt enclosed by a rail fence waiting for the big moment
for a cold gray dawn there is the atmosphere of a festival here
an area close to the mound is roped off for news reporters and cameras
rita stands there a pocket of genuine beauty in this sea of potbellied old union guys and blow dried reporters
stomping her feet against the cold rita looks at her watch and glances around
larry the cameraman just looks bored
how could he be late
its just so inconsiderate
what happens to some people
theyre born nice
they grow up nice
you put em on tv and bam
rita spots phil heading into the crowd
here he comes
phil joins them in the press area
rita pulls him to his mark near the rail fence
whereve you been
i got hung up with some jerk i went to high school with
so did you sleep okay without me
you tossed and turned didnt you
rita holds up a slate for larry to id the tape
who told you
ready when you are
phil takes the microphone from rita and positions himself against the fence
the groundhog club officials in top hats striped trousers and cutaway coats parade out to the burrow that houses punxsutawney phil
looks like theyre starting
rita silently counts down from five and cues phil who instantly snaps into announce mode
to camera once a year the eyes of the nation turn here to this tiny hamlet in pennsylvania to watch a master at work
punxsutawney phil the worlds most famous weatherman the groundhog who as legend has it can predict the coming of an early spring
rita turns to larry
this is impressive so far so good
a groundhog club official kneels at the burrow and ceremoniously knocks on the small wooden door then opens it and retreats
and heres the big moment weve all been waiting for
lets just see what mr
groundhog has to say
the groundhog sticks his head out looks around steps out of the hole and runs over to the other side of the mound about as far away from the cameras
as he can get
over here you little weasel
larry zooms in as far as he can but the best he can manage is a close up of the groundhogs back
the groundhog stands there a moment his body casting a long shadow then he lets out a squeak and runs back into the hole
great shot huh folks
well that was certainly worth the trip
now well be hearing from mr
buster greene president of the punxsutawney groundhog club the so called seer of seers who will interpret for us
buster greene dressed up in his top hat and cutaway coat walks onto the mound and hushes the crowd
he came out and he saw his shadow
sorry ladies and gentlemen but it looks like its going to be a long winter
the crowd lets out a good natured awwwwww in disappointment
sarcastic to camera well thats it
sorry you couldnt be here in person to share the electric moment
this is one event where televison really fails to capture the excitement of thousands of people gathered to watch a large squirrel predict the weather and i for one am
deeply grateful to have been a part of it
reporting for channel this is phil connors
larry cuts the camera
to phil you want to try one thats a little sweeter
to rita thats as sweet as i get
im outa here
as he exits phil tosses the mike to larry who isnt expecting the throw and bobbles it dropping the mike on the ground
phil is sitting alone having a cup of coffee in a busy loud and lively cafe
rita enters sees him sitting there crosses to his table and sits down across from him
that was really lousy
is it my fault the little rat went south on us
a real professional would have handled it
you acted like it was a personal insult
who do you think you are wolf blitzer
god you really take this stuff seriously dont you
yes i do
as far as i m concerned there are no little stories phil
only little reporters with big egos who think theyre too good for the job they have to do
trying to look hurt you really dont know me very well do you
cause if you did you could never say something like that about me
call me a cockeyed optimist but i happen to think theres more to this job than just getting my ugly mug on the boob tube every night
is that so
yes that is so
rita is so irritated by him she cant even respond
phil looks at her evenly for a long moment
so as far as us getting together would you say the glass is half empty or half full
larry pokes his head in the doorway looks around spots rita and makes his way over to their table
to rita you ready
we better get going if we re going to stay ahead of the weather
you dont have to rush off you know
that storm is going to miss us completely
nice working with you phil
see you around
rita walks away leaving him sitting alone
phils lexus is driving down the highway
light snow is just starting to fall
on the earphone ill call you after i see the network guy
i should be back there in a couple of hours
cant hear you youre breaking up
phil is getting annoyed as the phone connection deteriorates
the snow is getting heavier
phil switches on the windshield wipers
can you hear me
he slams the phone back into its cradle then looks up and notices slow traffic up ahead
he honks his horn as the traffic comes to a complete stop
he keeps honking but nothing moves
he rolls down the window and looks up ahead
the highway is a parking lot
phil jumps out and begins to walk down the highway past the parked cars shivering in his light sweater and silk sport shirt
the snowfall is getting heavier and the wind is pickin up
the snow comes down unnaturally hard and fast
he walks on slipping and sliding in his expensive loafers until he j comes to a police roadblock up ahead manned by two highway whats going on officer
nothins goin on
were closin the road
big accident up ahead
blizzard movin in
a couple of flakes
an isolated phenomenon of nature
are you nuts
we got a major storm movin in
all that moisture is going to miss us and hit harrisburg
pal you got that moisture on your head
but i have to get to pittsburgh today
mister the only place anybodys goin on this road is back to punxsutawney
phil glowers at him and shivers
phil is on a pay phone
snow is falling heavily outside
gas station attendant is shovelling around the pumps
so all the long distance lines a re down
what about the sa tellite
is it snowing in space
but i have to call pittsburgh
isnt there some special line you keep open for emergencies or for celebrities
well im both really
im a celebrity in an emergency
can you patch me through on that line
the door opens and phil is blasted with frigid arctic wind and blowing snow
the gas station attendant enters the tiny office and in trying to squeeze past phil accidentally bangs him on the head with his snow shovel
phil is at the bar in punxsutawney s oldest and best hotel the pennsylvanian
he looks very bored drinking a beer unsuccessfully hustling an attractive local girl named nancy
you never saw me on tv on the news
i dont think so
what part of the news do you do
i m the white house correspondent for nbc news
oh i m so sure
ask me anything
okay how big is the white house
three bedrooms two and a half baths
looks much bigger than it is
nancy just stares at him clearly not into his sense of humor
suddenly a bride in full white wedding gown and veil rushes into the bar crying and shouting
a gaggle of bridesmaids flutters around her trying to coax her back to her own wedding but she wont budge
then the groom wearing a bad rented tux comes storming in and tries to drag her back until the best man restrains him and the bridesmaids hustle the bride away
phil watches the whole drama play out then turns back to nancy
i m sure theyll be very happy
so what do you say
you want to play doggie obedience school with me
she gets up to leave
he watches her go then tosses a tip on the bar and exits somewhat unsteadily
the cover reads curses spells and enchantments you can do at home
a well manicured feminine hand opens the book to a marked page
phil enters his room and drunkenly tosses his overcoat scarf and gloves on the floor in a heap
stephanie decastro phil s disaffected ex lover is sitting cross legged on the floor with the book of curses open in front of her
her hair is down shes wearing a caftan with a zodiac print there are candles everywhere and other vaguely occult decorating touches
phils business card is dropped into a dish
then the tarot card of the hanged man a chicken bone and a feather are placed on top of it
he stands at the sink looking at himself in the mirror flexing his muscles
reading from the book she mutters incantations in a secret language then she sprinkles some powder on the plate then a few drops of oil
then she makes a few passes over it with her hands and much to her surprise the contents of the plate spontaneously combust
as he crosses to the bed he accidentally knocks over the suitcase stand spilling his clothes out onto the floor
he contemplates picking them up for a moment decides to leave them there and flops down on the bed
he lies there looking u up at the ceiling until the room starts to spin around then he closes his eyes and quickly drops off to sleep still fully clothed
to complete the spell she picks up a broken wristwatch and drops it into the fire
phils business card the hanged man and the broken watch in flames
the watch crystal is cracked and the hands are frozen at
the digital clock radio changes from to am
the radio comes on playing the end of the sonny and cher hit i got you babe just as it did the day before
phil sits up in bed quickly alert and looks around the room
something is wrong
hes wearing pajamas his suit is once again hanging neatly on the closet door and his suitcase is back on its stand at the foot of the bed again neatly
the song ends and the same radio deejay and his sidekick come on with the same manic energy
phil stares at the radio and listens to them
a look of astonishment comes over his face as they banter
okay campers rise and shine and dont forget your booties because its cooold out there today
its cold out there everyday
what is this miami beach
the deejay laughs
phil mock laughs at exactly the same time recognizing the repartee from the previous morning
to himself nice going guys
thats yesterdays tape
phil crosses to the sink and gets a towel off the rack only half listening to the radio
expect hazardous travel later today with that you know blizzard thing that blizzard thing
phil turns on the water and splashes some on his face as if trying to wake himself up vaguely disturbed by the repetition of the broadcast
oh heres the report the national weather service is calling for a big blizzard thing
yes they are but theres another reason today is very special especially cold especially cold okay but the big question on everybodys lips phil supplies the next line in unison
with the radio
chapped lips on their chapped lips right do you think phils going to come out and see his shadow
some vague doubt causes phil to go to the window
thats right rodent lovers
sound effect of grunting groundhogs as phil pulls back the curtains and looks out
the street is full of people heading toward gobblers knob exactly as they did the day before
what the hell
phil rushes out into the corridor hastily tying his tie his suit jacket and overcoat over his arm
as he heads for the breakfast room the same chubby man passes
think itll be an early spring
stops irritated didnt we do this yesterday
i dont know what you mean
phil grabs him by the front of his shirt and looks deep into his eyes
dont mess with me pork chop
what day is this
febr uary second groundhog day
phil can see hes telling the truth and relaxes his grip on the poor man
im having a bad day
phil walks on leaving the chubby man baffled and insulted
to himself ill say
phil enters the old library of the house and finds everything exactly as it was the day before
lancaster spots phil as she comes out of the kitchen with the fresh pot of coffee
did you sleep well mr
completely confused d i d i
i dont know would you like some coffee
yes thank you
i m feeling a little strange
as she pours i wonder what the weathers going to be like for all the festivities
did you ever have deja vu mrs
is that the italian dessert with the brandy and the chocolate mousse
no thats spaghetti
he heads for the door still in a daze
oh will you be checking out today mr
i dont know
i dont think so
ill tell you after i wake up
phil gulps down the steaming coffee still trying to wake up from what he assumes is a dream and descends the front steps of the house
he accosts a passerby
wheres everybody going
to gobblers knob
its groundhog day
the coffee cup drops from phils hand as he stands there open mouthed
then he slaps his own face and shakes his head as if trying to clear it and starts off down the street
phil rushes down the street again failing to notice the old bum sitting on the sidewalk leaning against a storefront
ned ryerson approaches with the same obnoxious attitude
i thought that was you
phil just stares at him and keeps walking
my oh my
dont say you dont remember me cause i sure as heck fire remember you
first shot right out of the box
so hows it going ol buddy
to tell you the truth neddy i m not feeling real well
could you excuse me
now its funny you should mention your health cause youll never guess what i do
very distressed and desperate to get away from this guy do you sell insurance ned
youre sharp as a tack today
do you have life insurance phil
cause if you do i bet you could use more who couldnt
but i got a feeling you dont have any
am i right
really annoyed now did i say fuck off ned
i cant talk to you right now
he backs away from ned and steps right into the same deep slushy puddle he stepped in the day before
out for that first v step
its a doozyi phil looks down at his wet shoes and cuffs and stumbles off toward gobblers knob
the crowd is gathered as before for the big moment
in the press area rita is having the same dialogue with larry when she spots phil heading into the crowd
here he comes
phill hey phil
phil waves to her and heads straight for an obscure corner of the knob gesturing for her to follow
larry shakes his head as rita charges through the crowd toward phil
she catches up to him just as he is scratching a mark in the snow with his foot
she notices immediately that he is uncharacteristically dishevelled his tie askew his hair mussed
where ve you been
nervous sweat ing ive got to talk to you
i think im losing my mind
i know youre losing it
what are you doing over here
the cameras over there
slap me rita
what is this
just slap me hard
she gives up and taps him lightly on the cheek
i said hardl i cant
rita shrugs and slaps him very hard
his cheek smarting better
almost too hard rita
are you drunk
no drunk is more fun
can i be serious with you for a minute
i dont know
i m being serious
i m having a problem no i may be having a problem
what are you trying to say
im trying to say that if i was having a problem just hypothetical ly i d like to know that youre someone i could count on in a crisis
what did you do last night
the crowd begins to hush
we better get started
were going to miss it
were not going to miss it
indicating the other theyre going to miss it
weve been out here for an hour
were cold and tired
lets just get this and get out of here
okay put it here
put the camera here
rita takes a forlorn glance towards the press area where all of the other cameras are set up
phil there is no tomorrow on this one
its groundhog day
we were in the wrong spot yesterday
w ha t
what are you talking about
just trust me
put the camera here
rita looks at him like hes crazy then looks at her watch and gives up
she charges off toward the cameras
in the press area several reporters are already talking to their cameras dribbling on about how he could appear any second now
rita and larry grab their gear and rush back to phil
larry hurriedly sets up the camera
you want me to roll tape
to phil are you going to get on your mark
larry glances over at the other news reporters all talking to their cameras and pointing towards the mound
everyone else is rolling
rita looks helplessly at phil
im begging you all right
gould we please just do this
phil glances down at his watch
okay lets do it
he crosses over to larry and taps him on the shoulder
phil takes the microphone from rita and positions himself against the fence
phil does a similar intro to the one he did before though this time its a bit tentative
to camera we ll its groundhog day again and you know what that means
everybodys here on gobblers knob waiting in the cold for the appearance of the most famous groundhog in the world punxsutawney phil whos going to tell us just how much
more of this we can expect
the groundhog club official knocks on the groundhogs door then opens it and retreats
phil takes a deep breath and makes his first experimental prediction recalling the previous day
my forecast is were going to see the groundhog peek its head out of its hole look around a little bit then hes going to come out scamper over to
this general area look at the crowd for a second make a little burping noise and run back into the ground
whispers to larry thats it
im going to kill him
phil looks at his watch
o k ay
and here we go phil points to the hole and larry zooms in
the groundhog sticks his head out looks left looks right steps out of the hole and runs away from the press pool directly over to larrys camera
as he stands there his body casts a long shadow
the groundhog looks right into the camera lets out a squeak and runs back into the hole
rita and larry are completely amazed as the crowd cheers the brief appearance of the groundhog
larry pans back to phil
phil just stands there speechless staring at the groundhog burrow
buster greene the groundhog club official walks onto the mound and hushes the crowd exactly as before
he came out and he saw his shadow
sorry ladies and gentlemen but it looks like its going to be a long winter
again the crowd lets out a good natured awwwwww in disappointment
larry pans back to phil just in time to see him walking away in a fog without signing off
then he pans back to rita
at a loss for channel news this is rita hanson in punxsutawney
she holds for a moment then makes the cut sign drawing her finger across her throat
phil is on the phone desperately trying to make a call
on the phone i know theres a blizzard but i have to get a call through to my doctor in pittsburgh
its a medical emergency
no dont give me the punxsutawney fire department
when do you think the long distance lines will be working again
but what if we dont have a tomorrow
we didnt have one today my friend
he hangs up and shakes his head which is now really starting to ache then he pops a handful of tylenol lies down and pulls the covers up over his
a moment later he sits up takes a pencil from the nightstand breaks it in half and puts the pieces back on the nightstand
then he lies back down and retreats back under the covers
the digital clock radio changes from to am
the radio comes on playing the end of the sonny and cher hit i got you babe just as it did the day before
phil sits up in bed fearing the worst and looks on the nightstand
the pencil is whole again
completely stunned by the phenomenon he jumps out of bed and starts dressing hurriedly as the morning deejays begin their now familiar rap
okay campers rise and shine and dont forget your booties because its cooold out there today
its cold out there everyday
what is this miami beach
phil rushes out of the room
phil hurries toward the bed and breakfast carrying two gallon buckets of paint and a couple of big bags from a hardware store
phil enters and passes mrs
lancaster in the breakfast room
painting something mr
i m conducting an experiment
phil enters and dumps the bags on the bed
out fall a couple of big paintbrushes a small sledgehammer a handsaw a crowbar plastic goggles and assorted other tools
he puts on the goggles grabs a hammer and some nails and starts nailing the door shut
lancaster and several other guests are gathered in the hall outside phils room listening at the door and looking very worried
loud music is playing inside the room
from inside the room they hear the sound of loud hammering wood splintering and glass breaking
phil has demolished just about all the furniture and woodwork in the room
he rips off the last of the wooden moldings with the crowbar then crosses to the mirror over the demolished sink
phil stands there staring at his image in the mirror trying to figure out whats happening to him
he starts breathing heavier as if gathering courage then just when we think hes going to cut off his ear or something he raises an electric barber clipper and shaves
a bald stripe up the middle of his head
he studies his new look for a moment then smashes the mirror with his sledgehammer
then he opens the cans of paint dips the two big brushes into the cans and starts slapping bright red paint onto the walls madly feverishly splashing himself and everything
else in the room with it
as a final touch he grabs the bed pillows and rips them open then shakes them all around the room creating a storm of feathers
finally phil falls exhausted on the bed
from outside we can hear outraged hotel employees pounding on the door
we pan over to the clock radio the only undamaged object in the room
feathers drift down past the face of the clock which reads am
the time changes to the radio clicks on and i got you babe starts playing as we pan back to phil sleeping on the bed
he opens his eyes jumps out of bed and looks around
no paint no feathers no damage
everything is as clean and tidy as the day he checked in
he races over to the unbroken mirror and looks at himself
his hair is completely restored as if it had never been shaved
the song ends and the deejays come on
phil says every word right along with them shocked into a state of complete wonderment
okay campers rise and shine and dont forget your booties because its cooold out there today
its cold out there everyday
what is this miami beach
the deejay laughs
phil laughs insanely along with him
phil is wrapping up another groundhog report trying to be completely professional despite the circumstances
with forced good s o according to mr
groundhog i guess we can expect six more weeks of winter
its not very scientific but it sure is fun
hey wait a second
if hes right i could be out of a job
mock laugh for channel news this is phil connors in punxsutawney
he holds until larry stops tape then approaches rita
how was that
it was good
a little smarmy for my taste but i guess thats what sells
could i talk to you about a matter that is not work related
you never talk about work
do you know what i did last night
do i want to know
i destroyed my hotel room
you whatl this is not some kind of rock and roll tour
we dont have the budget for that no its okay
this morning it was all right again
thats what i have to talk to you about
phil what are you doing
phil and rita cross the street and walk past a crowd of concerned citizens gathered around what looks like a car accident
as an ambulance arrives phil and rita enter the cozy looking diner on the corner
phil and rita sit together at the same table they had previously
the waiter approaches
to waiter could i have some coffee please
the waiter pours her a cup
ill be back to take your order
to phil okay so tell me
howd you know where to put the camera
because ive done it before
i know but the groundhog doesnt do exactly the same thing every year does he
i m not talking about last year
i m talking about today
i lived it before
youre having deja vu
rita i know its nuts but i keep reliving the same day o ve r and over groundhog day today
this is the third time
completely skeptical uh huh
im waiting for the punchline
its like today never happened
i shaved my head last night today its all grown back
i could probably cut off my limbs one by one and pop
theyd grow back
just like a starfish
i probably dont even have to floss
im wracking my brain but i cant even begin to imagine why youd make up something like this
cause im not making it up
im asking for your help
rita looks at him for a long moment
okay ill bite
what do you want me to do
id ike you to spend the next hours with me and dont leave my side for a second
you know phil you can charm all the little p
s at the station all the secretaries and even some of the weekend a nchors but not me not in a thousand years
wa it a second not if i was dying and your breath was the only cure not if having your child was the only way to preserve the human race
just get it out of your head because it is not going to so much for the truth
larry pokes his head in the doorway looks around spots rita and makes his way over to their table
to rita you ready
we better get going if were going to stay ahead of the weather
yeah i m
good luck phil
x rays of phils skull are slapped up onto a light box
phil is having his head examined by a neurologist
no spots no tumors no lesions no clots no aneurisms
everything looks fine and dandy to me mr
have you considered psychiatric help
punxsutawneys only psychologist is a marriage and family counselor at the local lutheran church
his appearance and manner indicate he may have some serious problems of his own
not too confident thats kind of an unusual problem mr
most of my work is with couples and families
phil is lying on a couch
his head is completely shaved
yeah but youre still a psychologist
you must have had some course in school that covered this kind of thing
sort of i guess
so based on that what would you say
i d say that maybe youre i dont know a little delusional
youre saying this thing is not really happening to me
then how do i know this conversation is really happening
i guess you dont
then forget about me paying you
a discreet little alarm sounds
im afraid thats all the time we have mr
are you saying im crazy
humoring him not necessarily
if it concerns you we should schedule our next session as soon as possible
hows tomorrow for you
phil glowers at him
a scientist in a white lab coat is holding up the model
phil looks on with interest
now if the moon exerts a gravitational pull strong enough to cause the tides
then it may be theoretically possible for a black hole or a singularity of sufficient magnitude to actually bend time enough to cause it to fold back on itself
you think thats a realistic possibility
a paper airplane sails past his head accompanied by a noisy outburst of juvenile laughter
we pull back to reveal twenty five eighth graders running amok
i think someone may just need a little visit to the assistant principals office
get back in your seats
the bell has not rung yet
the kids sit back down but keep up their noisy chatter
to phil well i m speaking purely hypothetically
phil is walking toward the exit when he passes a first grade classroom
the door is open and the teacher is discussing a story with the class
so the princess picked up the frog and kissed him
phil stops outside the door to listen
now who can tell me what happened when the princess kissed the frog
her lips got slimed
the whole class erupts in giggles and shrieks
okay come on now
what happened when she kissed the frog
the princess kissed the frog and the spell got broke and he turned into a handsome prince and they got married and lived happily ever after
phil is leaning against the wall listening
there is something very arresting about the fairy tale but finally he just shakes his head and exits
phil is at a bar getting drunk with two local blue collar workers gus and phil
gus what would you do if there was no tomorrow
you mean like if the world was gonna end
no i mean like if it was never going to end
if everyday was the same and you were stuck here and you couldnt get out and nothing you did mattered
everyday is the same i cant get out of here and nothin i do matters
no hes askin you a question ya idiot
what was the question
what if nothing mattered
jeez i know what id do
i d j ust spend all my time drivin fast gettin loaded and gettin laid
it just doesnt get any better than this does it
good friends good conversation and quality brew
drink up boys
they salute each other and drink
phil gus and ralph approach ralphs big black old buick convertible parked outside the bar
they are even drunker than they were before
fumbling with his where you stayin phil
well drop you off
hey friends dont let friends drive drunk
give me your keys
hes as wasted as they are but ralph hands over his keys without a fight
they all pile into the front seat with phil at the wheel
starting the ear seatbelts
ralph and gus give him the thumbs up sign and start digging around in the seat cracks for their seatbelts
suddenly phil floors the accelerator and peels away sideswiping a parked car as he screeches around the corner
phil is having a great time
gus and ralph are whooping it up like kids on a roller coaster
this is great ralph
oh hey take a left
phil passes the intersection
you missed it
no problem phil throws the car into a high speed skidding u turn goes up on the curb across a couple of lawns takes out a mailbox and a stop
sign and bounces back onto the street
a police car parked in front of the hardware store pulls out and takes off after him
phil swerves in and out of oncoming traffic
gus is starting to look a little green
so many rules you can say that again
dont do this the buick demolishes a parked car
dont do that he mows down a row of parking meters
it comes screaming around a corner in hot pursuit of the buick ralph hears the siren and looks back at the police car
try and stop us you mothers
no more rules
no more rules
a second police car joins the chase
looking back thats two
having a good time
im having a great time
phil speeds up to a hundred miles and hour
gus is looking even worse from the liquor and the motion of the car
hey uh phil
yeah phil like the groundhog
howre we going to get out of this
two police cars with lights flashing are parked sideways completely blocking the road
officers stand in the roadway motioning for phil to stop
gus youre just going to have to trust me on this one
he tromps the gas pedal to the floor
guss eyes go wide with terror
the police dive out of the way
the buick crashes head on into one of the police cars
the time changes from to
the radio starts playing i got you babe
phil sits up suddenly and looks around completely amazed
he is in his room at the bed and breakfast everything exactly the same as before
he hops out of bed and quickly examines himself for signs of physical injury
the music ends and the two deej ays come on
okay campers rise and shine and dont forget your booties because its cooold out there today
phil talks out loud along with them
its cold out there everyday
what is this miami beach
the deejays laughs
phil laughs too exhilirated at having survived the car wreck still very confused and perplexed but just beginning to see the possibilities of his unique situation
he starts dressing in a hurry
phil rushes into the breakfast room just as mrs
lancaster comes out of the kitchen with the coffee
everything is exactly the same as before
w o u l d you phil interrupts answering all her questions before she even asks them
yes i would like some coffee the weather is going to be cold and overcast with blizzard conditions moving in later today and yes i will be staying an extra
why thank you
lancaster has anyone been around here looking for me this morning
maybe a state official blue coat hat gun nightstick badge driving a late model ford br chevy black and white with bub ble lights on top no no one like
dont will they be
greatly relieved apparently not
phil gooses her grabs a sweet roll and heads for the door starting to believe now that he can truly do anything he wants to
phil stops on the steps puts on his coat and gloves and again joins the traffic heading toward gobblers knob
phil passes the old bum ignoring him as usual
phil slips off his glove as ned ryerson lumbers toward him
ned the head
before ned can say another word phil slugs him
ned goes down phil puts his glove back on and keeps walking
phil deftly avoids the slushy pothole he stepped in before
a pedestrian walking behind him steps right into it
phil is passing through the crowd on his way to the press area when he notices nancy the girl he met at the hotel bar and stops to talk to
you here to see the groundhog
she gives him a look
its obvious shes never seen him before
can you think of another reason anybodyd be out here at dawn on a freezing day
whats your name
and you are whered you go to high school
what is this
she really doesnt know what to make of phil but she decides to play along
lincoln high school
who are you
who was your twelfth grade english teacher
are you kidding
nancy lincoln walsh
is this some kind of come on
im not really sure
well have to see
phil walks off and joins rita at their camera position
phil is sitting at his usual table which is covered with an incredible variety of rich foods eggs bacon sausage pancakes pies cakes eclairs ice cream puddings etc
rita sits across from him watching in amazement as he stuffs himself with pastry
is this some new fad diet
dont you worry about cholesterol
phil scrapes a plate and takes a final bite of a chocolate eclair
i dont worry about anything anymore
what makes you so special
everybody worries about something
thats exactly what makes me so special
he takes a big bite of cake
rita shakes her head
with his mouth full what
the wretch concentered all in self living shall forfeit fair renown and doubly dying shall go down to the vile dust from whence he sprung unwept unhonored and unsung
sir walter scott
stares at her for a long moment there was a young man from na n t uc k e t thats really funny
when are you going to grow up phil
at this rate never
he pulls out a pack of okay if i smoke
phil lights up a cigarette
you really do have a death wish dont you
just the opposite rita
i have a life wish
im just trying to enjoy it
taking pleasure in the little things
dont you ever just want to cut loose and go wild
i wouldnt even know what it means to go wild
yeah well thats where i come in
going wild is one of my specialties
last night i got completely loaded and drove head on into a police car
you look pretty good this morning
thats my point
i know you wont believe me but we could do anything we want today and it wouldnt matter one bit
absolutely no consequences
complete and total freedom
do we manage that
you leave that to me
why dont you send larry back and hang out with me for the rest of the day
you never make it through that blizzard anyway
larry enters the diner and spots them
ill take my chances with the weather
but you have a good time
i plan to
phil comes through the crowd and finds nancy in the same spot she was in the day before
nancy turns and looks at him quizzically
im sorry i nancy taylor

walshs english class

wow you look terrific
hey listen i gotta d o this report youre a reporter
right i shouldve known but maybe after we could yeah yeah i d like that phil
rita is calling from across the crowd
she looks at him with disapproval
phil is making passionate love to a woman in the dark
the woman suddenly freezes
there is a moment of silence then she snaps on the light
its nancy not rita
phil is as surprised as she is by his slip of the tongue
its just something i say when i make love
you know orita orighta its like oh baby or something
not entirely oh
corrects her o rita
nancy laughs uncertainly
phil switches off the light thinking now about rita
some elderly guests are sipping coffee and eating breakfast staring uncomfortably at something on the other side of the room
phil is standing at the bookcase wearing only pajamas absently munching on a danish as he reads from one of the books
lancaster approaches him
isnt it a wonderful collection
not looking up yes it is
you dont usually find this many trashy novels in one place
you can take a book up to your room if you like
no thank you
ive actually read them all
i was just rereading some of the dirty parts
he finishes and puts the book back on the shelf
how long will you be staying with us mr
ive already been here for days
humoring him really
thats quite a long time isnt it
i hope youre finding things to do in our little town
yes well im getting a little tired of casual sex so today i thought id rob a bank and buy myself a really expensive car
phil kisses her on the lips and walks off
two harmless looking old guards are calmly loading bags of cash into an armored car parked in front of a local bank
suddenly phil appears wielding a shotgun wearing a batman style cape his face completely hidden by a ski mask
all right freeze
drop your guns j
the guards stand there frozen with terror
you guys ever been held up before
they shake their its kind of exciting isnt it
i guess so
something to tell the kids about
by the way im phil
he raises the mask and shows his face
shaking their hands herman and felix
take it easy boys
the frightened guards watch as phil makes off with two large satchels of cash
phil pats the hood of a used bmw sports car as a salesman stands by beaming
phil is wearing a full steelers football uniform complete with shoulder pads
a real beauty huh
we picked it u p at a ill take it
well the sticker says bu t if you want ill tell you what
ill give you if you just knock off the car salesman stuff and let me get out of here with my car
the salesman gawks as phil opens his briefcase and starts counting out stacks of bills
from a high angle we see the bmw tearing around the streets of the town as if running a grand prix road race
the bmw comes screeching to a stop right in front of the movie theater and the door opens
a pair of really elaborate cowboy boots complete with silver spurs hits the pavement first then we pan up to see phil emerge from the car wearing a really gaudy
full cowboy outfit with real six guns on his hips
a very trashy looking girl laraine gets out on the passenger side dressed like a french maid
very self conscious i thought we were going to a costume party
yeah we are we are
but first i have this movie theater fantasy i want to talk to you about
he escorts her into the theater
phil is lying on the table getting elaborately tattooed
rita walks by looks in the window and is shocked to see phil there
phil waves at her and points to the colorful new heart pierced by a bloody dagger being tattooed on his arm
we pan down the line of rough trade patrons to
phil dressed all in black leathers both arms heavily tattooed looking like sid viscious on crack
he takes off his hat to reveal red white and blue hair shaved almost down to his skull
a slut named angie and another overweight not very pretty madonna wanna be both in too tight jeans and bullet bras are coming on to him practically licking his ears
angie pops a couple of mystery pills into his mouth
phil washes them down with a shot and a beer
it looks like outtakes from fellinis satyricon
heavy metal is blaring from the radio as several unsavory looking men and women are partying down a few already passed out sleeping off whatever hit them
someone is knocking loudly on the door shouting complaints about the music
a beer bottle smashes against the door
phil is sitting up on the bed with angie
he has his arm around her shoulder and a fifth of wild turkey in his hand
more to himself than to angie yeah but eventually you d just get tired of screwing around and then youd want a real relationship wouldnt you
i dont know
a big german shepherd tries to jump up on the bed with them
get down brunoi someone decent someone who you respected who respects you
i guess so
the dog jumps up again
still musing its tough to find a relationship like that especially if your time is kind of limited
but you still have to try dont you
the dog again bruno
i told you
off the bed
phil looks over at angle whos passed out with her mouth open there s got to be more to it than this
rita is in the news van reviewing the tape of phils report phil hovers at the open side door

i dont know phil

i d just want to know where to p ut the camera

she starts walking toward the center of town
phil sticks right with her

phil and rita are at their usual table drinking coffee

o h please why not
phil you know you have so much talent and ability

i dont know what

she stares hard at him

larry pokes his head in the doorway looks around spots rita and makes his way over to their table
to rita you ready

yeah ill be right out larry
larry scowls at phil and exits
to rita why dont you stay for a while
the roads going to be closed anyway

ive got to get back

phil watches rita exit
rita gets in the news van and drives off with larry
phil stares out the window more determined than ever to win her over
phil is wrapping up his groundhog report
well you heard it right from the groundhogs mouth
bundle up good cause its going to be a long winter at least in punxsutawney
reporting for channel this is phil connors
larry stops tape
that was great
how did you know i have to go now
theres something i have to do
phil runs off without another word of explanation
phil has the hood open and is doing something to the engine
rita is sitting at the bar in the towns best restaurant a good chophouse with black forest decor and waitresses dressed in dirndl skirts and aprons
phil enters and sits down next to her
acting surprised oh hi rita

rita looks at phil

the bartender pours
phil lifts his glass
to world peace
rita smiles reevaluating him
to world peace
they clink glasses
rita and phil are now sitting together at a table a plate of cheese and crackers and a bottle of white wine between them
you like your job
i think it could be really challenging
of course its about a million miles from where i started out in college
you werent in broadcasting
at bryn mawr
no uh uh

laughs good naturedly really
what a waste of time
rita looks offended
phil knows he made a mistake
you werent in broadcasting
at bryn mawr
no uh uh
believe it or not i studied nineteenth century french poetry
phil leans in closer to her
la fille qui jaimera sera comme bon vin qui se bonifiera un peut chaque matin
rita smiles entranced
phil and rita are sitting at a table in a small confectionery tasting chunks of different flavored fudge
rita takes a bite this is terrific
best fudge in town
how do you know so much about punxsutawney
i like small towns
i think they engender real community more than big cities
that is so true
ive always thought that too
here try the white chocolate
oh yuk dont make me sick
making mental note no white chocolate
theres something so familiar about this
do you ever have deja vu
then larry enters
irate to rita i dont believe it
someone bought every distributor cap in this town
were going to be stuck here all night over phils sympathetic look we hear the song i cant get started with you
the music continues over rita and phil on the small dance floor
they dance close dreamy romantic
there is a light snow falling
phil and rita are making a little snowman
somehow the town looks magical tonight old fashioned wholesome
a snowball hits phil in the back
he and rita turn around to see a giggling kid
phil packs a snowball and tosses it
the kid throws one back
rita and phil both get into it packing snowballs and getting into a war with this kid and his little gang of friends
a snowball catches rita unaware she slips and goes down in a snowbank
phil bends down to help her and slips
they are no together lying in the snow laughing
their eyes lock for a long sweet moment then rita gets embarrassed and stands up
phil and rita are walking slowly very close
i m just amazed
and im not easily amazed
how you can start a day with one kind of expectation and end up so completely different
do you like how this day is turning out
i like it very much
they stop dn front of phils hotel
she turns to him
you could never have planned a day like this but it couldnt have been more perfect
ive been planning this day for weeks
rita ignores the remark and hugs him
phil tries to kiss her but she gently puts her fingers to his lips stopping him
they enter the bed and breakfast inn
rita hugs him again and starts to exit
see you tomorrow
wait arent you going to come up to my room for a while
very reluctant i dont know phil noreason to end a perfect day
well we better not

rita shakes loose from his grasp
whats wrong with you
there is a long moment of silent tension then all her old doubts about phil come rushing back
shaking her head oh no
i cant believe i fell for it
this whole day was just one long set up
and i ate fudge
i hate fudge
no it was real
i love you
stop saying that
do you really expect me to trust you
the whole secretarial pool is a phil connors recovery group
but i can change
i really can rita slaps him hard on the cheek
thats for making me care about you
she turns and stomps off leaving phil standing there hurting
the snowball fight with the kids is going on as before
phil falls into the snowbank with rita and they almost kiss
phil is trying mos to talk his way into ritas room
she pushes him away and slams the door in his face
the streets are deserted except for phil staring up at ritas window in the quality inn
rita comes to her window and looks out
she sees phil looking up at her and draws the curtains
i got you babe is playing
phil hits the clock radio to turn it off
he lies there for a moment then hefts himself heavily out of bed not eager to repeat the day yet another time
with the radio off phil does the deejays morning routine himself seemingly for the millionth time
okay campers rise and shine and dont forget your booties because its cooooold out there today
phil continues the radio report at his own pace obviously fatigued
its cold out there everyday
what is this miami beach
and you can expect hazardous travel later today with that you know blizzard thing
phil is walking through the crowd
he spots nancy walks up to her and greets her half heartedly
do i know you
phil cant manage enough enthusiasm to pursue her yet again
no i guess not
i thought you were someone else
phil wanders over to where rita and larry are setting up the camera
rita comes over to him
are you all right phil
you look terrible
phil looks at her sadly then turns away
i m fine
the balls crack as the cue ball breaks the rack
phil is walking around the table cue in hand sinking ball after ball while several admiring hustlers look on
who is this guy
i dont know
hey mister phil doesnt stop who are you anyway
phil shoots sinks a tough one
you dont know me
ive been playing here every day for two months
so how come i aint seen you
i dont know

so whats your name
they call me punxsutawney phil
like the groundhog
yeah like the groundhog
phil sinks another one
the crowd is waiting expectantly for the groundhog to appear phil is a wreck squatting unprofessionally in front of the camera
this is one of the most pitiful spectacles known to civilization
with one nod from a filthy rodent best known to pest control agencies a moribund old coal mining hamlet turns magically into the lourdes of pennsylvania mecca to thousands of
people who if they hated the winter so damned much why dont they move to florida anyway
larry and rita look on incredulous
the program jeopardy
on tv nobel prize winning co discoverers of the dna molecule
who are watson and crick
on tv who are watson and crick
on tv correct
there is a cheering from a small group of people off screen
phil is sitting in his bathrobe in a big lounge chair in the parlor of his hotel
lancaster and other guests watch his performance awed by his intellect
on tv twin brother and sister sebastian and olivia create confusion in this shakespearean comedy
what is twelfth night
on tv what is twelfth night
on tv correct
more cheering from the small group
on tv ill take new jersey for eight hundred alex
on tv and the answer is an audio daily double
phil is walking through town still dressed only in his pajamas and overcoat counting the sidewalk cracks taking giants steps from one to the next
he looks crazy
two thousand six hundred and s e ve n ty o n e takes another step two thousand six hundred and se v en t y t w o another
step two thousand six hundred and seventy thr ee a woman passes walking her dog
hey pick up after your dog
he hasnt done anything

there and there
phil continues walking counting the sidewalk cracks
three neighborhood kids notice phil and walk along matching him step for step
two thousand six hundred and seventy four two thousand six hundred and seventy five two five million eight hundred s i x hundred ninety twenty four six fifty two thousand
four hundred two eight nine forty six phil stops
he has lost count
his lip curls up like an animal as he turns slowly growling at the kids
they run away screaming with glee
phil starts after them but runs right into a cop
you got a problem buddy
out of control yeah i got a problem buddy
i cant stand this place anymore
i cant stand this street and i cant stand the fourteen bars and the five banks and the one star food and the bad weather and the quaint little shops
and most of all i cant stand anything anything with a groundhog on it
he rips a groundhog patch off the cops jacket sleeve
then lets see what we can do about getting you out of here
you got a name
eyes downcast phil
like the groundhog
phil turns to the cop like a rabid dog ready to strike
yeah like the he stops as if struck groundhog
some big new idea has formed in his mind
rita is looking at phil as larry videotapes his report
turning to rita the guys nuts
hes out of his gourd
let him finish then ill call the station
they turn back to watch phils wrap up
phil is completely unkempt still wearing only pajama bottoms and his overcoat looking even more demented
to camera there is no way this winter is ever going to end as long as that groundhog keeps seeing his shadow everyday
i dont see any other way out
hes got to be stopped and ive got to stop him
for channel news this is phil connors
phil is walking around the mound casing it out
he takes a rifle out from under his coat and sneaks up to the burrow
he pulls a smoke bomb from his pocket lights it and throws it into the hole then scurries for the edge of the knob and hits the deck
he lifts his rifle and aims it
smoke is now pouring from the mound
lots of it
phil waits his trigger finger twitching
a woman casually walks by stops
she surveys the situation
he aint there
phil doesnt move
he doesnt care that she sees him
you can wait all night but he aint coming out
he dont live there
they keep him in the library
phils gun droops
the woman begins to walk off then stops
plug him once for me
phil passes a pedestal bearing a life size bronze statue of the groundhog and enters the public library
phil walks past the front desk looking very haggard and dangerous and enters the childrens section
no one is present except the childrens librarian a young woman reshelving books in the stacks
he looks around quickly and sees a window in the wall and over it a large sign which reads punxsutawney phil the great prognosticates phil heads right for it
the groundhog scurries around his little temperature controlled habitat oblivious to the approaching danger
as phil approaches the groundhog display he reaches into his overcoat and pulls out a pump shotgun with a short pistol grip
the childrens librarian sees the gun and freezes
phil pumps a shell into the chamber as he walks right up to the case
the groundhog looks right into his sights
philsqueezes the trigger
the glass window is still intact not a scratch on it
the groundhog looks up playfully
phil fires off four more rounds but again no results
phil cant believe it
he charges the glass and pounds it with the rifle butt
he cant even chip it
suddenly he is seized from behind by two strong men who take the rifle from him and wrestle him to floor
the librarian comes running up and looks at the groundhog
is he all right
hes just fine
thats two inches of bullet proof glass there
you cant be too careful in this day and age
the groundhog is just poking his head out of the hole
he stands full height and looks around
phil looks directly at the groundhog with hate and scheming madness
suddenly phil whips out a big kitchen knife from under his icoat and dives at the groundhog
town officials and police throw themselves on phil as the groundhog scampers safely back into his hole
rita and larry videotape the incident aghast at phils insane attack
larry and rita are loading their equipment back into the van
rita spots phil standing on the other side of the crowd staring at her
she marches straight over to him furious
where were you this morning
how could you possibly miss the shoot
at the end of his ive come to the end of me rita
theres only one way out now
just remember we had a wonderful day together once
phil kisses her gently on the cheek and walks off toward the back of the knob
rita watches him then follows at a discreet distance very worried
in a small clearing behind the man made groundhog burrow buster greene and two other groundhog club officials are lifting a cage into the front seat of busters pickup
to the groundhog there you go ol buddy
he smiled at me
securing the cage there little fella
the other official looks up and sees phil walking toward them like a zombie
hi there mister
something i can do you for
without a word phil jumps quickly into the cab of the pickup and starts it up
what re you
phil drives off in busters truck
rita witnesses the groundhog napping and runs back toward the knob
buster and his aides race for another car parked nearby
call the police and get the word out
somebody kidnapped phil
were going after him
come on tommy
they jump into a car buster guns the engine and takes off after the pickup
rita runs up to larry and grabs the camera on the fly
phil just snatched the groundhog
larry does a slow take and starts gathering up the rest of the gear
probably some kind of gerbil deal
phil comes tearing around a slippery curve followed by buster in his car and close behind him a contingent of police cars and the channel news van
phil looks at the groundhog on the seat next to him then punches the gas as he turns up a mountain drive
coming to the end of the trail phil
then were going out in a blaze of glory
buster pursues phil with relentless determination
nobody takes my groundhog and gets away with it
rita is driving
larry is hooking up the camera
very upset what is he doing
what can he be thinking
he must ve just snapped
larry squeezes into the passenger seat with the camera mounted on his shoulder
this oughta be good
the cars chase the pickup to the top of the mountain
i know this road
theres no way off cept the way we come up
we got him now
the pickup is losing its lead over the pursuers as it nears the sharp mountain cliff
phil looks in his rearview mirror at the cars chasing him
he glances down at the groundhog
he takes a breath
phil hits the gas
larry is taping as rita comes around the curve just in time to see the pickup truck speeding toward the cliff
rita hits the brakes and watches in horror
the pickup bursts through a retaining fence and rockets over the edge of the cliff
the pickup seems to hang in the air for a long time then it begins its slow motion descent falling ever so gracefully until it impacts on the granite rock
face far below
then a small click followed by i got you babe
he slowly opens his eyes and blinks
he looks around and realizes hes back in his room at the bed and breakfast
phil throws off the covers and hurls himself out of bed
ned and a client are huddled over his desk looking at some papers
a body drops quickly past the window behind them
they rush to the window and look down at the sidewalk three stories below
phil is sprawled there like a broken puppet lifeless
i got you babe is playing
phil wakes up and smashes the radio
rita and larry are walking down the street when a greyhound bus pulls out of the bus station and accelerates down main street
suddenly phil dressed in pajamas and overcoat leaps out in front of the speeding bus
rita witnesses the whole incident
he sees phil through the windshield but doesnt even have time to hit the brakes before he runs right over phil
a woman in some horror movie is screaming
lancaster is watching tv in the parlor of the hotel
in the corridor behind her phil walks by dressed in a robe carrying an electric toaster and a towel heading for the bathroom
a few moments pass
we hear the zap of an electrocution the lights and tv flicker and dim for a moment then come back on again
the building is surrounded by police all crouched behind their cars with guns and rifles trained on the doors
suddenly the doors burst open and phil comes running out of the bank screaming dressed in camouflage fatigues and armed to the teeth with an assault rifle in one hand
an uzi in the other and a couple of handguns stuck in his belt
he doesnt get three feet before he is shot down in an incredible hail of gunfire
rita stands beside the camera gaping in horror while larry records the grisly massacre
rita stands by weeping while phils body is covered with a sheet
in the shadowy darkness under the sheet a click is heard and phils eyes pop open
i got you babe plays
phil pulls the sheet off his face and finds himself back in his bed in his room
a tear falls from his eye
phil and rita are sitting in the diner at their regular table
i m sorry
what was that again
im a god
no im a god
not the god at least i dont think i am
for a mintute there i thought you might be crazy
no its true
its the only possible explanation
im a supernatural being
because you survived a car wreck
the waiter comes to the table
are you ready to order
to rita ignoring the not just the car wreck
i didnt just blow up yesterday you know
ive been run over drowned crushed stabbed shot electrocuted poisoned frozen burn ed and asphyxiated really
the waiter looks at him like hes nuts
but i always wake up the next day without a scratch without even a headache
im telling you i m immortal
the special today is blueberry waffles
why are you telling me this
because some people like blueberry waffles
to the waiter no t you him
because i want you to believe in me
youre not a god phil
take my word for it
this is twelve years of catholic school talking
i could come back if youre not ready
how do you know im not a god

because its not possible
ill come back
the waiter turns to leave
the waiter turns back
this is bill
hes been a waiter for three years because he left penn state and had to find work
he likes the town he paints toy soldiers and hes gay
i am notl phil grabs an astonished rita and pulls her over to the next table
what are you doing
this is doris kleiser and her fiance fred
do i know you
theyre supposed to get married tonight but doris is having second thoughts
doris touces her engagement ring dumbfounded
rita is a little embarrassed
phil drags rita to the counter
this is ralph
say hi rita
rita flashes a quick smile
dont believe ive had the ralph hates his life here and wants to drive around town smashing into policemen
well who dont
this is some kind of trick
yes its a trick
but maybe the real god cheats too
maybe god isnt omnipotent hes just had a lot of practice
how about that guy
worked in the coal mine til they shut it down
went to lincoln high school in pittsburgh
takes herself out to lunch once a week
rita is getting very bewildered
from their reactions she can see that phil is right about each and every one of them
how do you know these people
i told you the truth
in five seconds theres going to be a grease fire in the kitchen
five four this is nuts
three two one
phil points to the kitchen as smoke starts pouring from the service window
everyone in the diner is now staring at them trying to puzzle it okay enough
lets just sit down and think for a second
they sit what do you know about me phil
do you know me too
phil takes a long pause
i know all about you rita
i know you like producing but hope for better than channel pittsburgh
everyone knows that
you like boats but not the ocean
theres a lake you go to in the summer with your family up in the mountains with an old wooden dock and a boathouse with boards missing in the roof
and a place you used to crawl underneath to be alone and at night youd look up and see the stars
youre a sucker for rocky road marlon brando and french poetry
youre wonderfully generous youre kind to strangers and children and when you stand in the snow you look like an angel
how are you doing this
i told you
i wake up every day right here right in punxsutawney and its always february second and i cant turn it off
if you still dont bel iev e me listen b u t phil listen
in ten seconds larry is going to walk through that door and take you away from me
but you cant let him
please believe me
youve got to believe me
i dont larry pokes his head in the doorway looks around and spots rita
as rita turns around to see larry phil grabs a pen and pad from a passing waitress and quickly writes something down as larry makes his way to their table
phil finishes writing
to rita you ready
we better get going if were going to stay ahead of the weather
phil hands the paper to rita
she reads it
stay ahead of the weather
larry looks at the paper
what s that
rita looks at phil with new understanding and empathy
phil and rita are walking down the sidewalk
afer i got over the shock it was kind of fun for the first year or two
i had anything i wanted
except you of course
phil abruptly pulls rita aside
a big pile of snow slides off a roof and onto the sidewalk where they would have walked
phil doesnt even look up
rita looks as if shes seeing a miracle
how did this start
i dont know
i just woke up
just like always
ned ry erson approaches
phil connors rita this is ned ryerson
hes an asshole
he remembers me
phil and rita keep walking
rita looks back at ned perplexed trust me on that one
phil and rita come out of the shop sharing pieces of fudge
this is great
no it isnt
you hate fudge
just how well do we know each other
i told you
i know everybody
rita stops walking
did we ever
did we ever
you were an animal
youre european trained arent you
phil continues walking
its not funny
she catches up to him
phil turns to her
you werent interested
she begins walking again
not that it wouldve been so awful
i just had to know whether to smack you or not
phil and rita are sitting on a park bench
so do you believe any of this
i dont know
i dont know how else you could know so much
maybe it is really happening
i used to try to stay up all night sometimes
i thought if i could stay conscious i could figure out what was going on or at least hang onto something from the day before
but i gave up on that a long time ago
rita looks at him with compassion
it sounds so lonely
trying to shrug it its not that bad
you get used to it
rita comes to a decision
maybe i should spend the rest of the day with you as an objective witness
just to see what happens
thatd be okay
a hat is lying on phils bed
a playing card flies past
a second playing card sails right into the hat
another playing card sails past missing
another playing card sails right in phil and rita are tossing cards
rita is missing
phil is hitting
its not in the wrist so much as the fingers
be the hat
it would take me a year to get good at this
four five hours a day
is this what you do with eternity
now you know
its like waiting for a bus that never comes
you should see me play pool and bowling juggling hacky sack
i can ride a unicycle
there s a knock on the door
ill get it
phil jumps for the door and opens it
the pizza guy is there
including the delivery charge right
u h hh h phil pays him takes the pizza and closes the door
opening the pizza box mmmm
pepperoni and olives
i told you i know everything
taking a bite of i don t think i d want to know everything that s going to happen
i like to be surprised
thats not the worst part
whats the worst part
the worst part is starting over everyday
tomorrow you wont remember any of this
youll go back to treating me like a complete jerk no its not your fault
i am a jerk
no youre not
okay i m not
it really doesnt make a lot of difference
ive killed myself so many times i dont even exist anymore
im just completely empty
or completely clean
if youre going to be this positive all the time i may have to rough you up a little
have we done this before
you getting me up here the card gam e the pizza no this is the first time
well how does it feel to be doing something completely new
phil looks at her with tremendous affection and gratitude
he takes a slice of pizza and starts eating with gusto
theres only one slice left
phil and rita are sitting together on the bed close but not touching
soft music is playing on the radio
sometimes i wish i had a thousand lifetimes
one to be a great journalist
one to i dont know go back to school study art or auto mechanics
one just to take care of all the busywork you know pay the bills get my car tuned up
one to be the wild woman of borneo
one to be mother theresa
maybe its not a curse phil
it all just depends on how you look at it
phil stares at her for a long time letting this sink in
then he belches really loud
rita stares at him then burps surprisingly loud herself
i want you to know its been a really nice day for me
maybe if its not too boring for you we could do it again
i hope so
the clock reads
rita grabs phils hand
he puts his arm around her
they look into each others eyes
rita gives phil a reassuring smile
she squeezes his hand
their eyes turn to the clock
rita looks up at phil as if expecting some magical event
youre still here
i thought you were supposed to disappear or i was or something
not til six
she is mad in a playful way
i never said midnight you knew i was waiting for midnight
but i never said it
oh i cant believe you
she slugs him with a i didnt know this was going to take all night
does that mean youre going
phil takes ritas hand
she doesnt resist
rita is now sitting right next to phil on the bed her head resting on his shoulder
she nods off then catches herself
its okay to go to sleep you know
i promise i wont touch you much
no its all right
im not tired
what were you saying
her eyes start to close again
i was saying that the cow was eventually returned to its rightful owner
drifting off really
he looks at her sees shes truly asleep and gently maneuvers her into a comfortable reclining position on the bed
then he carefully puts a pillow under her head and settles down next to her
what i was going to say was i think youre the kindest sweetest prettiest most wonderful girl i ever met in my life
she starts to stir but he gently kisses her back to sleep
satisfied shes still i could never tell you this but from the first minute i looked at you i wanted to just hold you close and be with you forever
ieverytime i saw you around the station i thought my heart was going to explode
i used to dream about us being together
in my dream you loved me as much as i loved you and we didnt have to say anything but i knew you understood everything
she stirs again but he kisses her until she returns to deep sleep
i know a guy like me could never deserve to have someone like you but if i did i swear i would love you for the rest of my life
rita opens her eyes
did you say something
good night rita
he kisses her gently on the forehead
good night phil
the time changes from to
the radio starts playing
phil wakes up alone in bed
he lies there for a moment then leaps out of bed like a man reborn and heads straight for the shower
rita and larry are in the packed press area beginning to set up the equipment
phil arrives carrying two cups of coffee
she looks at him without a trace of the rapport they shared the night before
oh hi phil
thought you might like some he hands her the coffee
careful its hot
he hands larry a cup
surprised mutters yeah great
were just setting up
you know i bumped into buster greene he kind of runs this thing and he tipped me off that we might get a better shot over there
i mean maybe we should go for it
what do you think
sounds good to me
sure why not
she reaches for an equipment case
ill get that
phil helps larry carry the camera gear
to larry you and i never talk larry
you got kids
larry looks suspicious
rita looks on reevaluating phil
phil enters the library approaches the librarian
where would i find the philosophy section
down and to the left s
phil walks through the stacks past the groundhog window
phil rings the doorbell
a kindly young woman mary answers yes
i d like a piano lesson please
okay i m with a student now but ill give you a thousand dollars
mary hesitates only a moment then ushers phil into the house and closes the door
a moment later the door opens and a little girl with an armloa of music books exits as if pushed
the door closes behind her
phil walks happily down the hallway
he passes the chubby man
buon giorno signore
think it be an early spring
winter slumbering in the open air wears on his smiling face a dream of spring
phil and mary are sitting together at the piano
phil is playing poorly
not bad mr
you say this is your first lesson
phil plays on definitely improving
we see several cuts of phil studying at the library
supered over these cuts is a calendar with the pages flipping by
they all read february
phil stands in front of the camera giving his report
in fact the groundhogs legendary ability to predict the weather may be more than just the german folklore of the region
higher temperatures trigger hormonal changes in the testosterone levels of male groundhogs which may in fact wake them from hibernation and send them out to battle with other males for
so the truth is theyre not looking for their shadows theyre looking for groundhog chicks
rita looks on clearly delighted with the report
phil is playing the piano with ever increasing skill as more february calendar pages flip by
phil is delivering another report
groundhog day february second also known as candlemas day or the feast of the purification of the virgin mary the day mary first came to the temple for ritual blessings
following the birth of the infant jesus and celebrated since the middle ages by the sacramental lighting of candles
hence the old scottish couplet which long predates the american groundhog tradition if candlemas dawns bright and clear therell be two winters in the year
larry whispers an aside to rita
is he making this stuff up
beyond the graveyard is a work shed with various tombstones scattered about
old tucker the town stonecarver is at work chiseling a name into a gravemarker
behind him phil is chipping away at a small hunk of marble sculpting a very lovely cherub
rita sits on a stool eating an apple and sipping hot tea watching him with amazed interest
but what if the rules changed
what if none of your actions had consequences
there would still be an absolute morality
there has to be an absolute good regardless of the circumstances
oh is that so miss plato
then let me ask you this
where does this absolute good come from
from the sky
i dont know
from my freshman philosophy course i guess
they both laugh
then she looks at him for a long moment and grins
i just cant believe youre such a fine sculptor
phil takes a bite of her apple and gets up
i gotta go
where do you have to go in punxsutawney
i got piano and then drums
come on ill drop you off
phil drops rita off and watches as she crosses the street to larry who is waiting on the other side
across the street rita takes a wistful glance toward phil then gets in the news van and drives off
phil gets out of the car and starts walking but finds himself face to face with ned ryerson
i thought that was you
i dont believe it
ive missed you so much
phil gives ned a big hug and keeps holding on for an uncomfortably long time actually giving ned a hickey on the neck
ned goes into homophobic shock
uh i gotta get going
nice to see you phil
he hurries off
phil is sitting on the piano bench with mary playing pretty well
mary is astonished
how long have you been studying mr
phil is walking down the street
he glances down the alley as he passes stops walks back and enters the alley
the old bum that phil never noticed before is lying there huddled against a wall
phil goes to help him
come on lets get you somewhere warm
the old bum turns to look at phil then closes his eyes
helps the old man to his feet there you go
phil practically carries him out of the alley
a nurse approaches phil
you the one brought in the old man
how is he
he passed away just now
phil pauses for a long moment
whatd he die of
he was just old
it was his time
i want to see his chart
phil brushes past her and makes for the big double doors leading to triage
sir you cant hurrying after him look
some people just die
not on my watch
phil is propping up the old man at a table trying to feed him hot soup
phil is furiously looking over x rays flipping through medical journals and making notes
phil is in the alley shaking the old man trying to rouse him
hang on there
the body lies unmoving
phil sits back breathing heavily
phil is delivering his report
everyone there is silent and listening to phil
even the other reporters have turned their cameras on him
when chekhov saw the long winter it was a winter bleak and dark and bereft of hope and yet we know winters only one more step in the cycle
and standing among the people of punxsutawney phil looks directly at basking in the warmth of their hearths and hearts i couldnt imagine a better fate than a long and
rita smiles too
for channel news i m phil connors
there is much applause
even larry brushes away a tear
phil hands the microphone to rita
im gonna be late
phil rushes off
late for what
to larry could you break it down and wrap out of here by yourself larry
rita rushes off after phil
phil walks briskly toward an intersection glancing nervously at his watch
rita follows him at a distance hurrying to keep up
marie a little nine year old girl approaches the intersection shielding her brand new puppy under her winter coat
she isnt paying attention to traffic and fails to notice a big truck bearing down on her
as she steps off the curb phil arrives and with split second timing nonchalantly but firmly grabs her coat to hold her back just as the big truck rushes past
in the street narrowly missing her
did you forget to look both ways
you didnt even look one way
my doggie was cold
yeah well my doggies are freezing but i m still gonna watch out for cars
see you around kid
phil looks at his watch and rushes off
rita looks on amazed and follows him at a distance
phil enters the crowded restaurant and pushes past all the people waiting to be seated
he walks casually but quickly and purposefully around the tables squeezing past busy waitresses and seated patrons toward a commotion in the back of the restaurant
two businessmen are leaning over a third
oh my god
hes having a heart attack
lay him down
what do i do
hes not hes turning blue
phil walks straight up to the blue faced man grabs him from behind gets him in the heimlich grip and squeezes sharply
a bolus of food flies across the room
the victim coughs and sputters then starts breathing again
jerry you okay
i think that did it
phil lets go of the grateful victim
if youre going to eat steak get better teeth will you
enjoy the rest of your lunch gents
who was that guy
phil gets to the door and finds rita standing there looking at him in awe
okay hold it right there
i want to know what s going on and i want to know right now
im sorry im really pressed right now
meet me outside the hospital about and well talk about it
phil looks at his watch and rushes away
try the curlycue fries
a gurney bursts through the double doors paramedics and nurses in attendance
the patient is a teenage girl janey totally unconscious
the gurney is wheeled into the surgery
looks like insulin shock
shes probably diabetic
phil enters wearing a doctors scrub suit and begins barking orders
shes not diabetic
its an overdose
lets get her up here and pump her stomach then i want a complete blood work up stat
r i g h t doctor uh she realizes shes never seen him before
call me phil
like the groundhog
sick children in hospital gowns are gathered around phil laughing and squealing
making balloon animals
make a giraffe
its just like a dog with a biiiiig what was it
a big tail
okay a big tail
a big neck
phil makes an animal really quickly
rita watches from the doorway unseen by phil
a dog with long legs
a dog with a big head
the kids attack phil
lots of rolling around on the bed
rita watches completely enthralled
finally phil extricates himself and exits to find rita waiting
all right now whats going on
taking her arm come on
we have to hurry
phil rushes down the sidewalk with rita close behind him
he stops under a tree and puts his arms out just as a young boy falls out of the tree and into his arms knocking him to the ground
the kid runs off unhurt as phil gets back to his feet and brushes himself off
to rita that little bastard has never thanked me once
i ought to j ust let him fall
teach him a lesson
phil this is too i must be dreaming
yeah you and me both
come on were almost done
phil kneels on the cold ground beside the old bum who lies huddled against the wall immobile
rita is standing by at the end of the alley watching as phil examines him
phil writes something down on a small pad
he finishes and sets it down by the old man
then he takes his coat and uses it to cover the man up
a siren is heard
phil stands and walks away as an ambulance pulls into the alley
in a minute
she waits and watches
the paramedics bud and andy get out of the ambulance and inspect the scene
its ol really
thats a shame
bud picks up the note phil left
rita steps closer
may i see that
reading aloud every night by cold bricks i watch the shadow rising from this old man in the snow
at we let it go
at we let it go
wow thats nice
rita hands him the note and quickly walks away
suppose he wrote it
are you kidding
rita catches up with phil outside the pennsylvanian the towns oldest and best hotel
as phil and rita enter there is music coming from a side room
the black velvet announcement board proclaims kleiser scott phil and rita walk into a banquet room decorated with streamers balloons and flowers
there is a long buffet table and a punch bowl
another long table is loaded with wedding gifts
a small band is playing
people are dancing
the wedding party is dressed in rented tuxedos and appropriately pouffy bridesmaid dresses
this is incredible
whos wedding is this
phil grabs two glasses of champagne and hands one to rita
just some friends
dorisi the bride doris young and cheery is on her way to see phil
she is dragging fred her groom with her
come on freddy

hows it going fred
hey i d like to thank you for making doris go through with this

phil reaches into his pocket pulls out two tickets and hands them to doris
what is this
oh no way
doris throws herself on fred and jumps up and down
fred grabs the tickets
doris throws herself on phil
how did you know

doris gives phil a kiss
she and fred move on
i don t understand
you rush from one person to the next in a town you only visit once a year you know everything before it happens and you i don t know you

the band finishes a set
the guests stop dancing and head for the refreshments
phil and rita are left alone for the moment what do you want to know
who are you
i really dont know
no theres something going on with you
okay i wake up in punxsutawney on february second every day
i dont even try to explain it anymore
so i live each day as if its the only day ive got
rita stares into his eyes for a very long time but sees only good true things
thats pretty amazing
you want to know whats really amazing
ive been waiting for you every day for ten thousand years
i dream of you every night of my life
youve been my constant weapon against total despair and just knowing you exist has kept me alive
rita cant even speak
this is clearly the nicest thing anybody has ever said to anybody
mary the piano teacher notices phil
to her friend this is the guy
rita this is one of punxseys finest musicians
give me a break
you should talk
why dont you play something
n o i please
go for it
phil looks at rita
she nods and shrugs
phil walks up to the platform and sits at the piano
he begins to play a slow serious classical piece
everyone falls silent
its so beautiful rita is almost in tears
then after a pause to let the serious notes sink in phil transforms the piece into a fast lively upbeat jazz romp
everyone is delighted and as the rest of the band kicks in everyone grabs a partner and begins to dance
an old coot uncle leo grabs rita and the two of them dance up a storm
thats a great guy youve got there
doctor connors fixed my back you know
do ctor connors
rit a looks over at phil joyously playing the piano
it is snowing lightly
phil and rita are walking slowly arm in arm close
they stop and embrace
phil looks at rita
she looks like an angel
phil scoops up some snow and begins packing it down furiously joyously then rolling it into a large ball
making a snow man
no stay there
stand right th ere
ph il lifts the now larger chunk of packed snow and sets it on a mailbox
then he looks at her and starts to sculpt it
phil is using a stick and the heat of his bare hands to model a delicate fold in the snow sculpture
several bystanders look o n with interest as phil stands back from his work
can i look
o kay look
it is an excellent likeness of rita the snow white as alabaster pure as marble a beautiful and delicate homage
nobodys ever done this for me
not even a drawing
this is how i see you
when it all gets too much i just close my eyes and there you are just like this
take it home and keep it in the freezer
rita embraces phil
they are about to kiss looking deep into each others eyes
this ones for the frog prince
they kiss a long deep soul stirring kiss
will you come with me
they continue standing there embracing warming each other in the cold night air
looks back at the ice were just going to leave her
it doesnt matter
really it doesnt
they kiss again
the digital clock radio changes from to
no sonny and cher no deejays nothing
phil sits up in bed
he looks around the room
things are different messier
then he sees the covers move
wide eyed now he looks over and sees rita waking up snuggling deep under the covers
its not true
it cant be true
phil pounces on rita showering her with kisses
i cant believe youre here
glad to see you too
dont you get it
its phil turns on the radio
still shoveling put the highways but if youre walking its a beautiful day
yeah the snow kind of cleaned e ve r yt h in g up except your mouth
phil kisses the radio
i love those guys
are you always this jolly in the morning
phil runs to the window and looks out
the street is virtually empty the town just waking up
kids are throwing snowballs
theyre all gone
you mustve had some dream
phil stops thinks
did i just dream it
phil opens the door and runs into the hallway wearing only pajama bottoms
rita sits up in bed and waits
suddenly from somewhere else in the inn comes the sound of phil at the piano expertly playing a difficult classical piece
he stops after a few bars
phil runs back into the room
it really happened
youre really here
he pounces on rita again
youre really actually here
im here im here
they kiss passionately hungrily
he scoops her up in his arms
wherere we going
phil and rita dressed now enter and encounter mrs
lancaster phil hugs her
say hello to rita
she loves me
im not surprised
he kisses her on the cheek and rushes out with rita
phil and rita walk down main street hand in hand
i wanted to thank you
thats all right
i a florist steps out of the flower shop with a bouquet
i want you to have these
phil smells the flowers and hands the bouquet to rita
and so began my final lifetime and ended the longest winter on record
i would find myself no longer able to affect the chain of events in this town but i did learn something about time
you can waste time you can kill time you can do time but if you use it wisely theres never enough of it
so youd better make the most of the time youve got
a car skids on the ice and smashes into a tree
phil and rita rush over to help but the driver waves that hes okay
rita and phil continue their walk
larry never got through the blizzard so none of my groundhog reports ever made it on the air
but rita and i we lived happily ever after
phil and rita walk off together
across the street larry is trying to get rid of ned ryerson who is doggedly trying to sell him insurance
but phil told me you were his accountant
look i told you
larry keeps trying to walk away but ned wont leave him alone
let me just tell you about single premium life finally larry slugs ned and storms off leaving ned floundering in a snowbank
phil and rita walk on as we pull up and away from main street revealing the whole of punxsutawney and the snowy countryside that embraces it
