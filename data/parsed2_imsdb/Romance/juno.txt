written by diablo cody juno macguff stands on a placid street in a nondescript subdivision facing the curb
juno is sixteen years old an artfully bedraggled burnout kid
she winces and shields her eyes from the glare of the sun
the object of her rapt attention is a battered living room set abandoned curbside by its former owners
there is a fetid looking leather recliner a chrome edged coffee table and a tasteless latchhooked rug featuring a roaring tiger
it started with a chair
flashback juno approaches a boy hidden by shadow
hes sitting in an overstuffed chair
she slowly clumsily lowers herself onto his lap
a s brazilian track plays from a vintage record player
do you know how long ive wanted this
a dog barks jarring juno back to reality
hey shut your gob for a second okay
we see a teacup poodle tethered in the yard a few feet away from the abandoned living room set
the dog yaps again
this is the most magnificent discarded living room set ive ever seen
she swigs from an absurdly oversized carton of juice and wipes her mouth with the back of her hand
juno marching down various street pumping her arms like a jogger and chugging intermittently from the huge carton of juice
we watch her breathlessly navigate suburbia clearly on a mission
finally a panting juno arrives at dancing elk drug on the main drag of her small minnesota suburb dancing elk
the automatic doors of the store part to reveal junos flushed serious face
she carelessly flings the empty juice container over her shoulder and onto the curb
a group of dropouts with skateboards near the entrance glare at her
she enters the drugstore
rollo the eccentric drugstore clerk sneers at juno from behind the counter
he wears a polyester uniform vest
if it isnt macguff the crime dog
back for another test
i think the last one was defective
the plus sign looked more like a division sign
rollo regards her with intense skepticism
i remain unconvinced
rollo pulls the bathroom key out of reach
this is your third test today mama bear
your eggo is preggo no doubt about it
an eavesdropping tough girl wearing an oversized jacket and lots of makeup gapes at juno from the beauty aisle
oh girl you are way pregnant
its easy to tell
is your nipples real brown
a pile of stolen cosmetics falls out of the girls jacket and clatters to the floor
juno crosses and crosses her legs awkwardly hopping
its obvious she has to use the bathroom urgently
maybe youre having twins
maybe your little boyfriends got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice
i just drank my weight in sunny d
and i have to go pronto
rollo sighs and slips her the bathroom key
juno races down one of the aisles
well you know where the lavatory is
calling after her you pay for that pee stick when youre done
dont think its yours just because youve marked it with your urine
jesus i didnt say it was
well its not
youre not a lion in a pride
to himself these kids acting like lions with their unplanned pregnancies and their sunny delights
in the dim reeking public bathroom juno hovers over the commode with her boxer shorts around her ankles
she clumsily tries to use the pregnancy test
we see the test box sitting on the sink
its a teenwave discount pregnancy test
the accompanying outdated package photo is of a shrugging s teen with a resigned expression
the fine print on the box reads from the makers of sun glitz lightening hair spritz
juno holds the developing test in her hand and slaps the open test box on the front counter
rollo scans it and bags it indifferently
oh and this too
she places a giant licorice super rope on the counter
so whats the prognosis fertile myrtle
minus or plus
examining stick i dont know
yeah theres that pink plus sign again
god its unholy
she shakes the stick desperately in an attempt to skew the results
that aint no etch a sketch
this is one doodle that cant be undid homeskillet
juno walks slowly and dejectedly up the street to her house gnawing on the super rope
she stops and loops the super rope over a low hanging tree branch contemplating how to fashion a noose
juno trudges toward her house
the yard is a wild tangle of prairie grass and wild flowers
junos bedroom is decorated with punk posters the damned the germs the stooges television richard hell etc
she picks up a hamburger shaped phone to call her best friend leahs room is cluttered with the sentimental junk that certain girls love to hoard
the phone rings
answering phone yo yo yiggity yo
i am a suicide risk
is this juno
no its morgan freeman
got any bones that need collecting
only the one in my pants
in low tones dude im pregnant
maybe its just a food baby
did you have a big lunch
its not a food baby
i took three pregnancy tests today
i am definitely up the spout
how did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests
i drank like ten tons of sunny delight
and youre shockingly cavalier
is this for real
like for real for real
oh my god
thats the kind of emotion i was looking for in the first take
well are you going to go to havenbrooke or women now for the abortion
you need a note from your parents for havenbrooke
women now i guess
the commercial says they help women now
want me to call for you
i called for becky last year
eh ill call them myself
but i do need your help with something very urgent
leah and juno struggle to drag a recliner across a well manicured suburban lawn
they make a formidable team
heavy lifting can only help you at this point
that is sick man
leah busts a gut laughing
its a stunningly accurate portrayal of bleekers parents
so you were bored
is that how this blessed miracle came to be
nah it was a premeditated act
the sex i mean not getting pregnant
when did you decide you were going to do bleeker
like a year ago in spanish class
bleeker and juno are sitting at their desks listening to a teacher lecturing about spanish
bleeker discreetly pushes a postcard to juno with his foot
she picks it up off the floor reads it then looks at bleeker who is watching the teacher obediently
you love him
its extremely complicated and id rather not talk about it in my fragile state
she hefts a coffee table with her bare hands
shes wearing her fathers lifting belt
so what was it like humping bleekers bony bod
it was magnificent man
cu of bleeker putting on double socks in his car bed
cu of bleeker putting on his sweat bands
cu of bleeker applying runners glide
cu of a croissant pocket warming in the microwave
paul bleeker steps onto the front porch of his house for early morning track practice
he wears a cross country uniform that reads dancing elk condors
he is eating some kind of microwaved snack gimmick
bleeker is startled to discover that juno is outside waiting for him
she has somehow arranged the living room set on the front lawn and is seated in the armchair chewing a pipe officiously
hey cool tiger
yeah i swiped it from ms
your shorts are looking especially gold today
my mom uses color safe bleach
a beat so guess what
shrugs i dont know
juno pops up the footrest of the recliner and leans back comfortably
i guess so
fidgeting what are you going to do
the dancing elk prep cross country team runs past bleekers house in a thundering herd wearing a motley assortment of warm ups
their momentum stirs the crackling fall leaves
they wave and holler at bleeker and juno
when i see them all running like that with their things bouncing around in their shorts i always picture them naked even if i dont want to
i have intrusive thoughts all the time
im supposed to be running
theres an awkward silence
so what do you think we should do
i thought i might you know nip it in the bud before it gets worse
because i heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant
thats what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant
so thats cool with you then
yeah wizard i guess
i mean do what you think is right
im real sorry i had sex with you
i know it wasnt your idea
whose idea was it
ill see you at school o
she mounts her bicycle and waves before riding off
to nobody in particular whose idea was it
juno pushes her crappy bike into the bike rack and winds a lock around it
in the background a group of nerds play a live action rpg
you did not
you dont have the armor
that orc armor you bought from the wizard doesnt have the power level to parry my hit
juno tries to push through the masses but the throng of students is thick and unwielding
juno rummages through her locker which is plastered with photos of leah and bleeker plus a giant poster of iggy pop in his heyday
she grabs a dilapidated physics textbook
a few pages slip out
steve rendazo the same asshole who harassed her as she walked to the drugstore passes by in the hallway
hey your book fell apart
it must have looked at your face
he high fives his klatch of buddies and moves along
the funny thing is that steve rendazo secretly wants me
jocks like him always want freaky girls
girls with horn rimmed glasses and vegan footwear and goth makeup
girls who play the cello and wear converse all stars and want to be childrens librarians when they grow up
oh yeah jocks eat that shit up
we see steve looking back at juno for a brief second with mixed feelings
they just wont admit it because theyre supposed to be into perfect cheerleaders like leah
who incidentally is into teachers
we see leah at the far end of the hallway talking animatedly with a paunchy middle aged teacher keith
from a distance me too
i love woody allen
students bustle in as the teacher mr
tinker tries to maintain order
juno heads toward her desk and sets down her bag
were doing our photomagnetism lab today so find your partner and break out into fours
juno looks up and meets eyes with her longtime lab partner bleeker
sound the gong of awkwardness
juno and bleeker head separately over to an available lab station and unpack their bags in silence
nothing like experimenting
i did the prep questions for this lab last night
you can copy my answers if you need to
he slides a piece of graph paper in front of juno without looking at her
oh i couldnt copy your work
but you copy my work every week
im kind of a deadbeat lab partner huh
i dont mind
you definitely bring something to the table
the other two lab partners a humorless couple join them at the station
so whos ready for some photomagnificence
i have a menstrual migraine and i cant look at bright lights today
amanda i told you to go to the infirmary and lie down
you never listen
no josh i dont take orders
not from you and not from any man
you know youve been acting like this ever since i went up to see my brother at mankato
i told you nothing happened
because your eyes
are very cold
theyre very cold josh
theyre cold lying eyes
my eyes are not lying
yes they are josh
since mankato they have been lying eyes
juno and bleeker observe the argument like tennis spectators fascinated by the dynamics of a real couple
im going to set up the apparatus
juno want to get a c clamp out of that drawer
im going to the infirmary
call me when youre off the rag
call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brothers college just because you had four smirnoff ices and a bottle of snow
peak peach flavored boones
good ill be sure to do that amanda
ill make a note of it
he furiously scrawls a fake memo in his notebook
snow peak peach is the best flavor of boones
bleeker reddens and continues constructing the apparatus
girl lab partner stalks off dramatically
bleeker shakes his head and rifles through his textbook
juno examines a large ad in the newspaper that depicts a distraught teen girl clutching her head in a moment of staged conflict
the ad reads pregnant
find the clinic that gives women choice
womens choice health center
juno picks up her hamburger phone and dials
for a moment she attempts to copy the melodramatic pose from the ad checking herself out in the mirror
talking along with voice prompt para instruciones en espanol oprima numero dos
she presses a few buttons in succession
yes hello i need to procure a hasty abortion
what was that
im sorry im on my hamburger phone and its kind of awkward to talk on
its really more of a novelty than a functional appliance
she smacks the phone a couple of times
yeah as i said i need an abortion two
um it was approximately two months and four days ago that i had the sex
thats a guestimate
okay next saturday
she hangs up the phone
i hate it when adults use the term sexually active
a health teacher in slo mo puts a condom on a banana
what does that even mean
can i deactivate someday or is this a permanent state of being
i guess bleeker went live that night we did it
i guess he hadnt done it before and thats why he got that look on his face
we see paulies face at the moment of his deflowering hes comically wide eyed with shock
juno her father mac her stepmother bren and liberty bell sit at a very typical kitchen table eating dinner
mac shovels food while chatting about his day
you should have seen this octopus furnace
i had to get out my hazmat suit just to get up in there
my dad used to be in the army but now hes just your average hvac specialist
he and my mom got divorced when i was five
she lives on a havasu reservation in arizona
with her new husband and three replacement kids
oh and she inexplicably mails me a cactus every valentines day
pile of neglected cacti festering in a corner of junos room
and im like thanks a heap coyote ugly
this cactus gram stings even worse than your abandonment
bren is cutting up libertys food diligently
her nails are brilliant holding the silverware
thats my stepmom bren
bren stitches a needlepoint pillow of a dog
shes obsessed with dogs
brens nail salon in all its glory
owns a nail salon called brens tens
bren chats up a customer as she applies a fresh coat
and she always smells like methylmethacrylate
liberty bell coughs pitifully as bren leans over her plate
so juno how did your maneuver go last night
which maneuver sir
the one in which i moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another or the one in which i cleared a sixty four ounce blue slushie in
bren speaks in her strong city accent
did you happen to barf in my urn
mac you know that nice urn by the front door the one i got up in stillwater
i found some weird blue shit i mean stuff gunk in there this morning
i would never barf in your urn brenda
we see liberty bell blithely pouring bacon bits onto her dinner
liberty bell if i see one more baco on that potato im gonna kick your monkey ass
juno trudges toward the front entrance of the clinic
there is a lone abortion protester a teenager of asian descent holding a hugely oversized sign that reads no babies like chanting in extremely shy accented voice all babies want
to get borned
all babies want to get borned
juno recognizes the protester as a classmate of hers
uh hi su chin
oh hi juno
how are you
pause did you finish that paper for worths class yet
no not yet
i tried to work on it a little last night but im having trouble concentrating
you should try adderall
im off pills
i know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once
she took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at ridgedale mall and she was like blaaaaah
im a kraken from the sea
i heard that was you
well it was nice seeing you
she continues on toward the clinic entrance
calling out juno
your baby probably has a beating heart you know
it can feel pain
and it has fingernails
she considers the concept then pushes open the clinic door
the receptionist sits behind a pane of bulletproof glass
the waiting room is semi crowded occupied mostly by pregnant women teens and ill behaved children
welcome to womens choice where women are trusted friends
please put your hands where i can see them and surrender any bombs
juno flashes her best jazz hands
im here for the big show
your name please
the receptionist raises a pierced eyebrow and arranges some paperwork on a clipboard
she thinks im using a fake name
like gene simmons or mother teresa
the receptionist hands juno the clipboard and a pen
i need you to fill these out both sides
and dont skip the hairy details
we need to know about every score and every sore
the receptionist reaches into one of those ubiquitous womens clinic condom jars and holds up a fistful of purple rubbers
would you like some free condoms
no thank you
im off sex
my partner uses these every time we have intercourse
they make his balls smell like pie
she takes a seat in the waiting room and rifles through a pile of old magazines
the magazine selection is lots of mommy mags and health related periodicals
she selects an issue of family digest and gingerly flips through for a few moments
then she looks over and notices the fingernails of a nearby teen who looks as nervous as she does
the girl bites her thumbnail and spits it onto the floor
juno looks away but immediately notices another waiting woman who absently scratches her arm with long fake nails
suddenly she sees fingernails everywhere
the receptionist clicks her nails on the front desk
another woman blows on her fresh manicure
everyone seems to be fidgeting with their fingers somehow
juno suddenly looks terror stricken
excuse me miss macgoof
theres no answer
we see that junos chair is empty
the receptionist cranes her neck and sees the front door drift shut
junos figure recedes into the distance as she tears off down the street running as fast as she can
leahs front door swings open to reveal a breathless juno standing sheepishly on the porch
what are you doing here dumbass
i thought i was supposed to pick you up at four
i couldnt do it leah
it smelled like a dentist in there
they had these really horrible magazines with like spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains like someone read them in the tub
and the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers and she told me about her boyfriends pie balls and su chin kuah was there
and she told me the baby had fingernails
i wonder if the babys claws could scratch your vag on the way out
im staying pregnant le
keep your voice down dude my moms around here somewhere
she doesnt know were sexually active
what does that even mean
anyway i got to thinking on the way over
i was thinking maybe i could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing
you know like a woman with a bum ovary or something
or some nice lesbos
but then youll get huge
your chest is going to milktate
and you have to tell everyone youre pregnant
maybe theyll canonize me for being so selfless
maybe theyll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to cabo san lucas for spring break
bleeker and i were going to go to gettysburg for spring break
leah sighs as if theres no helping her nerdy friend
well maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads
i see them all the time in the penny saver
there are ads
desperately seeking spawn
theyre right by the ads for like iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment
its totally legit
come on leah
i cant scope out wannabe parents in the penny saver
thats like buying clothes at the pump n munch
juno and leah are sitting at a bench in a park
they slurp giant blue slushies and sift through a pile of penny savers
juno has her pipe with her
the penny saver sucks
yeah but it sucks for free
they turn the pages in silence for a moment
their lips and teeth are windex blue
look at this one wholesome spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other
checks to see that juno is paying attention all thats missing is your bastard
reading a different page theres a guy in here whos giving away a piano
free for the hauling
we should put it in bleekers yard
youre not listening to me
no i heard you
i just cant give the baby to people who describe themselves as wholesome
im looking for something a little edgier
what did you have in mind a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest
i was thinking a graphic designer mid thirties and his cool asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass
but im trying to not be too particular
all right how about this one
healthy educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five
you will be compensated
help us complete the circle of love
yeesh they sound like a cult
besides theyre greedy bitches
they already have three kids
look at this one
she points to the paper and motions for juno to look
juno scans the ad silently
we see the ad
it contains a photo of an attractive couple with ambiguous mona lisa smiles
it reads educated successful couple wishes to
they were mark and vanessa loring and they were beautiful even in black and white
we see paulies bedroom window festooned with childish curtains and the light on inside
bleeker lies on his car bed in his track uniform listening to the same lp from when he and juno went all the way
he stares between the pages of his embossed dancing elk prep yearbook
we see the object of his gaze is junos black and white yearbook photo
next to it we see a sloppy handwritten message from juno
we hear junos voice reading the message hey bleeker
spank off to this with motion lotion
just kidding kind of
your best friend juno
bleeker picks up the phone
its the same hamburger phone juno has
he reconsiders and puts it down
theres a knock on the bedroom door
bleekers mom pokes her dowdy head inside
are you coming downstairs to eat
i dont think so
you ran eight miles today puppy
im not hungry oddly
but its breakfast for supper
your favorite paulie
i made french toast and sausage
patties not linkies just like you like it
bleeker places his hand silently on his stomach
juno macguff called while you were out running
she wants to know if youre coming to her little coffeehouse performance on saturday
thanks for the message
you know how i feel about her
youve mentioned it about fifty times
i just hope you dont consider her a close friend
bleekers mom gives up and closes the door
we see that bleeker is clutching a pair of panties in one hand which he slowly releases as the ends
bren and mac are seated on the couch
leah is standing nearby for reinforcements
juno paces nervously trying to suss out how to break the massive news
i have no idea how to spit this out
hon did you get expelled
the school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion
well i was just asking
it seemed plausible
do you need a large sum of money
no no im definitely not asking for anything
except maybe mercy
like it would be really great if nobody hit me
what have you done junebug
did you hit someone with the previa
best to just tell them man
rip off the band aid and let it bleed
bren and mac are predictably speechless
but im going to give it up for adoption
i already found the perfect people
leah presents the penny saver photos of the lornings
they say theyre going to pay my medical expenses and everything
i promise this will all be resolved in thirty odd weeks and we can pretend it never happened
im so sorry you guys
if its any consolation i have heartburn thats like radiating down to my kneecaps and i havent gone number two since wednesday
interrupting i didnt even know you were sexually active
juno cringes upon hearing her most hated term
who is the kid
i dont know anything about it yet
i only know its got fingernails allegedly
no i mean the father
whos the father juno
its well its paulie bleeker
bren and mac burst into shocked laughter
i didnt know he had it in him
giggling he just doesnt look well virile
i know right
okay this is no laughing matter
indignant no its not
paulie is virile by the way
he was very good in
leah fires a be quiet glance at juno
did you say you were thinking about adoption
yeah well theres this couple whove been trying to have a baby for five years
we found them in the penny saver by the exotic birds section
bren looks understandably alarmed
juno hastily attempts to make the situation sound more legitimate
but they have a real lawyer and everything
im going to meet with them next weekend
junebug that is a tough tough thing to do
probably tougher than you can understand right now
well im not ready to be a mom
damn skippy youre not
you dont even remember to give liberty bell her breathing meds
and she didnt die if you recall
honey had you considered you know the alternative
leah and juno exchange glances
well youre a brave young lady
youre made of stronger stuff than i thought
youre a little viking
first things first we have to get you healthy
you need prenatal vitamins
incidentally theyll do incredible things for your nails so thats a plus
oh and we need to schedule a doctors appointment
find out where youre going to deliver
the term deliver is so weird
can we not say deliver
how does crap it out sound
juno i want to come with you to meet these adoption people
youre just a kid
i dont want you to get ripped off by a couple of babystarved wingnuts
mac nods satisfied then contemplates the situation dismally
i thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when
i have no idea what kind of girl i am
sensing tension why dont you girls go upstairs for a while
i think macs gonna blow
juno and leah hightail it upstairs
just tell it to me straight bren
do you think this is my fault
her mothers fault
i think kids get bored and have intercourse
and i think junebug was a dummy about it
but we have to move on from here and help her figure it out
im not ready to be a pop pop
youre not going to be a pop pop
and junos not going to be a ma
somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from jesus in this garbage dump of a situation
i friggin hope
conspiratorially did you see it coming when she sat us down here
oh god yeah
but i was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs
that was my first instinct too
anything but this
and im going to punch that bleeker kid in the weiner the next time i see him
oh mac no
hes a sweet kid
you know it wasnt his idea
mac shrugs in agreement
music plays as we see sparse images of vanessa lorings hands preparing the house for junos arrival sprucing a vase of flowers
straightening a framed photo of the lorings
dusting off a table with one of those wetnaps for furniture
lining up a shelf of books
the previa cruises slowly into the lorings fancy gated community
mac pulls over and parks on the curb
mark and vanessa loring have an impressive though generic mcmansion
the entire yard is unlandscaped soil
mac presses the doorbell while juno chews her nails uncomfortably
both look mortified as they wait for someone to greet them
vanessa opens the door
shes a pretty meticulous woman in her early thirties
very banana republic
you must be juno and mr
thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home
come on in
vanessa awkwardly leads them into her home
can i take your coats
she takes off her hooded sweatshirt and thrusts it into vanessas arms who sets it on a bench
wicked pic in the penny saver by the way
not like those other people with the fake woods in the background
like im really going to fall for that you know
you found us in the penny saver
mark loring appears next to vanessa
hes a boyishly attractive guy in his mid thirties
he glances sheepishly at vanessa upon hearing the penny saver mention then extends his hand to mac and juno
im mark loring
im the husband
mark and vanessa usher juno and mac into the austere spacious living room
a woman in a business suit sits on the couch with a briefcase in her lap
this is our attorney gerta rauss
in exaggerated growling german accent geeeerta rauuuss
straight nice to meet you
mac seizes marks hand and pumps it heartily
im mac macguff and this of course is my daughter juno
like the city in alaska
well lets sit down and get to know each other a bit
ill get drinks
what would everyone like
ive got pellegrino vitamin water
a makers mark please
junebug has a wonderful sense of humor which is just one of her many genetic gifts
i also have good teeth
we finally got fluoridated water in dancing elk
she bares them frighteningly to demonstrate
vanessa stares unflappable
were fine thank you
mac and juno join mark and gerta rauss on the couch
first off how far along are you
im a junior
no i mean in your pregnancy
uh my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said i was twelve weeks
vanessa enters with the refreshments on a tray
oh thats marvelous
so youre almost into your second trimester then
im having it on may
the tough parts almost over for you
i mean my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest
yeah but i hardly noticed it
im more worried about the part where i have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front
i think pregnancy is beautiful
well youre lucky its not you
vanessas looks to the ceiling
clearing throat so lets discuss how were gonna do this
well i just have the baby and give it to you right
mark and vanessa are willing to negotiate an open adoption
what does that mean
it means theyd send annual updates photos let juno know how the baby is doing as he or she grows up
of course junos legal rights would be terminated
i dont want to see pictures
i dont need to be notified of anything
cant we just kick it old school
i could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way
you know like moses in the reeds
technically that would be kickin it old testament
mark and juno lock eyes
the way people used to do it
quick and dirty like ripping off a band aid
well then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved then
close it up
vanessa is clearly ecstatic
obviously well compensate you for your medical expenses
are you looking for any other compensation
im not going to sell the baby
i just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents
im in high school dude
im ill equipped
youre doing an amazing and selfless thing for us
vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married
i want to be a mommy so badly
juno and mac stare at her
you dont say
well havent you ever felt like you were born to do something
heating and air conditioning
well i was born to be a mother
some of us are
mark are you looking forward to being a dad
mark is caught off guard
sure why not
i mean every guy wants to be a father
coach soccer help with science projects and
i dont know
mac casts a subtle dubious glance at mark
well shall we start looking over the paperwork
gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents
can i use the facilities first
being pregnant makes you pee like seabiscuit
the powder room down here is being re tiled but you can use the master bath upstairs
go up then turn left and on your right
room with a toilet got it
juno heads into the foyer and up the stairs
we see a posed photo of mark and vanessa in the stairwell
their house is beautiful but frigid
juno rubs her arms shivering
the lorings bathroom is huge
juno flushes and goes to the double sink to wash her hands
she opens the overhead cabinet and sees vanessas toiletries
she spritzes on some perfume and examines the more expensive grooming items
theres a crinkled tube of lube in the cabinet
juno picks it up fascinated
she rubs a drop of it between her hands and runs it through her hair like pomade
juno opens the bathroom door and instantly bumps into mark
yikes i didnt expect to see you up here
i was just getting something
did your wife send you up here to spy on me
do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something
well you dont just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised
i could be a total klepto for all you know
i dont get a klepto vibe from you
wouldnt rule it out
i did steal a squirt of perfume
what do you think
its clinique happy
she holds her wrist up to marks twitching nostrils
smell those sparkling topnotes
am i supposed to feel happy now
you should be happy holmes
im giving you and vanessa the gift of life
sweet screaming pooping life
and you dont even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in
blood and guts
wed better get back downstairs asap
juno mocks his use of asap silently
halting wait a minute
is that a les paul
juno is staring into a room with the door slightly ajar
we see guitars mounted on the wall and the edges of posters
thats uh my room
vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff
wow you get a whole room in your own house
shes got you on a long leash there mark
the walls are plastered with framed posters of early s alt rock bands
mudhoney janes addiction etc
mark removes his les paul from its moorings and hands it to juno
ive always liked gibson better than fender
what do you play
i rock a harmony
holding back a chuckle oh
im a pawn shop rocker
i swear im not a gear snob
juno turns the guitar over examining it closely
what is that mahogany
what happens if you crack the neck
tell me about it
i used to play in a really tight band back when i lived in chicago and one night we opened for the melvins
do you know who the melvins are
well we were playing with them and i busted this guitar onstage
it cost me and a dime bag just to have it fixed
when was this like
im telling you that was the best time for rock and roll
you werent there so you cant understand the magic
you werent even alive
vanessa mac and gerta rauss are waiting in awkward silence for juno and mark to return
mac notices a brand new pilates machine sitting in its packaging in a corner of the room
whats that thing
a pilates machine
what do you make with that
you dont make anything
its for exercising
mark and juno tool around on the guitars unplugged
they play little riffs
he teaches her a couple chords
my wife just ordered one of those tony little gazelles off the tv you know from the guy with the ponytail
vanessa and gerta have no response
that guy just doesnt look right to me
suddenly a shriek of amp feedback followed by loud discordant guitar strumming can be heard drifting down from upstairs
vanessas looks to the ceiling
to her guests will you excuse me
mark has strapped on the les paul and is playing and singing
doll parts by hole
quietly singing together yeah they really want you
they really want you
they really do
singing together and connecting yeah they really want you
they really want you
and i do to
both blush vanessa appears in the doorway
juno immediately puts down the guitar
mark doesnt notice her immediately
passionate singing notices vanessa oh sorry honey
mark clumsily puts down the guitar and stands up
you guys are playing music
juno just wanted a closer look at kimber here
your guitar is named kimber
thats all right
my axe is named roosevelt
after franklin not ted
franklin was the hot one with the polio
i think gerta is waiting for us downstairs with some important stuff for us to go over
mark hangs the guitars back on the wall
he and juno exit the room chastised
vanessa looks to mark in question
didnt mean to interrupt the jam sessions
juno and mac have put their coats on and are in the process of leaving
gerta hands juno the documents
vanessa and mark trail behind
so look those over and give me a call at my office if you have any questions
juno wed really appreciate it if you could keep us updated on any doctors appointments ultrasounds other things of that nature
of course youd want to know how your kid is cooking
so then you really think youre going to go ahead with this
mac stares at juno gravely
i like you guys
juno looks at mark
percentage wise would you say youre sure sure
mark seems visibly embarrassed by vanessas manic demeanor
im going to say im sure
look if i could give it to you now i would
but it probably looks like a sea monkey at this point so i think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter you know
i think thats a great idea
thats great right
well you guys drive safe and well hear from you soon all right
all right take care of yourselves
juno and mac exit
mark shuts the door
all is silent in the foyer
mark vanessa and gerta stand motionless
gerta pumps her fist triumphantly trying to create a mood of celebration
overly aggressive all right
vanessa buries her head in her hands and weeps hoarsely
it is now winter
the track team jogs in formation leaving tracks in the snow
those bastards never stop running
bleeker is running alone on the track
his exhalations are icy puffs in the air
bleekers friend vijay jogs up alongside him
vijay is a solemn skinny boy much like bleeker
oh hey vijay
did you hear juno macguff is pregnant
just like our moms and teachers
did you hear its yours
what a trip man
i dont really know anything about it
you should grow a moustache
youre a real man now
i cant grow a moustache
it never comes in evenly
but im going to stop wearing underpants in order to raise my sperm count
vijay jogs off
bleeker stops and wipes away his sweat
were looking over junos now five month pregnant belly to a school administrator filling out a slip
juno takes the slip turns around and smiles all the way out
juno exits the head office and bumps into bleeker
a couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids
going for my ultrasound
gotta note and everything
ill try to drop by later
we see ultrasound goo being squirted onto junos exposed pregnant belly
an ultrasound technician is using a doppler device to view the contents of her burgeoning bump
bren and leah ooh and ahh at the resulting image
the tech takes measurements and types them into her database
thats the feet
and theres a hand
the monitor reveals the babys head
various check that out
dreamily would you look at that
check out baby big head
that kid is scary
hey im a sacred vessel
all youve got in your belly is taco bell
gazing at the monitor it is really weird looking
its like its not even real
i cant believe there are saps who actually cry at these things
juno and leah look at bren who is dabbing her eyes discreetly
im not made of stone
well there we have it
would you like to know the sex
aw please junebug
no i definitely dont want to know
planning to be surprised when you deliver
i want mark and vanessa to be surprised and if i know i wont be able to keep myself from telling them and ruining the whole thing
condescending are mark and vanessa your friends at school
no theyre the people who are adopting the baby
well thank goodness for that
wait whats that supposed to mean
i just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here
its obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in
juno leah and bren become immediately defensive
how do you know im so poisonous
like what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters
or stage parents
they could be utterly negligent
maybe theyll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would
have you considered that
i guess not
what is your job title exactly
i said what is your job title missy
im an ultrasound technician maam
well im a nail technician and i think we both ought to stick to what we know
what are you talking about
you think youre special because you get to play picture pages up there
bren gestures to the ultrasound monitor
my five year old daughter could do that and let me tell you she is not the brightest bulb in the tanning bed
so why dont you go back to night school in manteno and learn a real trade
the ultrasound tech exits in a huff
bren youre a dick
i love it
juno lays in bed checking out the ultrasound print out
the previa drives into the front gate of mark and vanessas exclusive community
a sign on the gate reads glacial valley
juno rings the doorbell shifting her weight in the cold
mark answers the door dressed in a t shirt and jeans
wow i didnt expect to see you here
ive got something really cool to show you guys
is vanessa here
no shes working late tonight
shes trying to accrue some extra time off for when you know
he gestures awkwardly to junos belly
i hear they can be kind of a time suck
come on in
you wanna ginseng cooler
what is it with you rich people and your herb infused juices
i dont know
something to do with the four packs
adding theyre not bad
mark leads juno into the kitchen where he pours two drinks
the stereo blares in the background
why arent you at work
i mostly work from home
im a composer
like johannes brahms
no more commercial stuff
have you seen those ads for titanium power mens deodorant
singing titanium power
get more snatch by the batch
i wrote that
youre kind of a sellout arent you
what would the melvins say
theyd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home
she holds up a manila envelope
come on youre going to want to sit down for this
as they move into the living room juno sits down and motions for mark to join her on the couch
park it dude
mark sits down
with great fanfare juno retrieves a dark glossy sheet from the envelope
its her ultrasound
behold good sir
the very first photo of your future child
mark examines the ultrasound baffled
i think it kind of looks like my friend paulie
joking oh is he bald and amorphous
no hes the dad
mark looks jolted as if its the first time he considered that her baby might have a father
he stands up and holds the photo up to the light critically
can you tell if its a boy or a girl
the doctor can tell but i decided not to know
i want it to be a big surprise
well it can really only go two ways
thats what you think
i drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter babies thats born without junk
i know what junk is
we definitely want it to have junk
well dont worry about it
my stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy
she wont even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red m ms
hope youre ready
do you hear that
a new song has begun
mark closes his eyes in ecstasy and walks toward the stereo
juno follows him toward the source of the music looking perplexed by how happy he is
what is it
its only my favorite song
its sonic youth doing superstar by the carpenters
excited ive heard the carpenters before
chick drummer and freaky dude
not unlike the white stripes
you havent heard the carpenters like this
mark grabs the stereo remote off the kitchen counter and turns up the volume to a roar
mark and juno stand in silence in the kitchen
mark mouths along with the lyrics
lipsynching dont you remember you told me you loved me baby
hey i like this
this album is all carpenters covers by alt rock bands
its called if i were a carpenter
it is god
ill rip a copy for you before you leave
you dont have to do that
its the least i can do
what did you say your favorite band was
but its a three way tie between the stooges patti smith and the runaways
yeah i definitely need to make you some cds
at least while my kid is hanging out in there
he gestures at junos burgeoning paunch
mark walks over to his music collections and starts pulling cds
hes got a carpenters disc the no alternative charity compilation and mother love bone
juno spots a vhs tape on the coffee table and picks it up
reading title the wizard of gore
distracted oh yeah
its herschel gordon lewis
hes the ultimate master of horror
dario argento is the ultimate master of horror
mark swivels around slowly on his desk chair surprised
argentos good but lewis is completely demented
were talking buckets of goo
red corn syrup everywhere
and fake brains up the yin yang
examining the tape box frankly this looks kind of stupid
mark gives a look oh really
we see some particularly memorable footage from the wizard of gore
mark and juno are watching the movie and drinking root beer floats
theyre sitting dangerously close on the sofa
watching movie this is even better than suspiria
youve got decent taste in slasher movies mark
heres to dovetailing interests
he raises his mug in a toast and juno clinks it awkwardly
so have you and vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet
well sort of
vanessa likes madison for a girl
isnt that kind of
i dont know gay
god pretentious much
i guess everyone should have a mysterious name like juno huh
my dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with greek and roman mythology
he named me after zeuss wife
i mean zeus had other lays but im pretty sure juno was his only wife
she was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean
like diana ross
that suits you
you know not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this
i weighed my options
but after all this im glad i didnt you know get rid of it
i want to have it
for you guys
youre something else
a door suddenly slams upstairs
shit you better get out of here
what the big deal
she just hates when i sit around watching movies and not contributing
ill handle this
im really good at diffusing mom type rage
juno jumps up and rushes out
vanessa slides her briefcase off her shoulder and ventures into the living room
shes struggling to carry some oversized shopping bags
are you home
i want to show you some things i picked up
juno intercepts her breathlessly clutching the ultrasound photo
mark trails behind her
vanessa jumps and makes a strangled sound
god you startled me
what are you doing here
then whats going on
i went to the doctor today
vanessa is obviously entertaining some worse case scenarios
her eyes are wide and shes uncharacteristically ruffled
is the baby okay
its the right size and everything
i even saw its phalanges today
she holds the ultrasound up to show vanessa and drapes her arm around her
this is the baby
vanessa drops the shopping bags sick with relief
oh my god
kindly doesnt it look like its waving
its kind of like its saying hi vanessa
will you be my mommy
yeah it kind of does
juno was nice enough to bring this by for us
i came over as soon as i got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis
my stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises
distracted oh thats great
she cant divert her gaze from the photo
nothing to worry about
vanessa chuckles tightly clearly embarrassed by her show of emotion
vanessa and mark walk juno out
juno peers at some shopping bags from various kids stores
hey what kind of swag did you score
mall madness huh
oh its just some stuff i picked up
for you know the baby
babies need a lot of things
i want everything to be just right
i thought people got all that stuff at baby showers
when my stepmom had my sister i remember she got about a million presents
they were all lame though so i wasnt jealous
i doubt anyones throwing us a shower
um i think people are kind of unsure about the situation because its not you know set in stone
what do you mean
aghast do you think im going to flake out on you
no no i dont think that juno
its just that we went through a situation before where it didnt work out
juno glances at mark and again at vanessa
vanessa looks embarrassed
you should have gone to china
i heard they give away babies like free ipods
they shoot em out of those t shirt guns at sports events
well juno your parents must be wondering where you are
you might want to head home
im already pregnant so they figure nothing worse could happen to me
i gotta bounce anyway
it was nice seeing you guys again
she waves and heads for the door
to juno hey dont forget your bag
vanessa looks pain stricken as mark helps juno with her bag
juno kicks the snow off her shoes before she enters
bren sits at the kitchen table with a mug of coffee and an issue of dog fancy
juno enters nonchalantly drinking a giant slushie
where the hell have you been junebug
i drove to st
cloud to show mark and vanessa the ultrasound
and i wound up staying for a couple of hours
a couple of hours
why are you going up there in the first place
they said they wanted to know about this stuff
they said to keep them updated so i did
you could have sent it to them
why would you drive an hour out to east jesus nowhere
i dont know i just did
and while we were waiting for vanessa mark and i watched the wizard of gore and he burned me some cds of weird music
hes kind of cool
a beat as bren absorbs this
that was a mistake juno
mark is a married stranger
you overstepped a boundary
listen bren duhhh i think youre the one overstepping boundaries
youre acting like youre the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else
besides who cares if hes married
i can have friends who are married
it doesnt work that way kiddo
you dont know squat about the dynamics of marriage
you dont know anything about me
i know enough
bren rises to leave clutching the dog fancy magazine
gesturing to the magazine we dont even have a dog
yeah because youre allergic to their saliva
ive made a lot of sacrifices for you juno
and in a couple years youre going to move out and im getting weimaraners
wow dream big
oh go fly a kite
bren storms out
juno heads to the urn by the door and defiantly pours the remains of her blue slushie into it
juno parks her previa on the street
she walks up to the house and rings the doorbell
bleekers mom answers visibly annoyed
her eyes drift down to junos middle
bleekers mom was possibly attractive once
but now she looks a hobbit
the fat one that was in the goonies
what can i do for you
i borrowed paulies physics notes in school today
im pretty sure he needs them back or his grade could plummet to an a minus
she steals another glance at junos belly
bleekers mom escorts juno wordlessly up the stairs and down the hallway to paulies bedroom
juno discreetly tries to charge ahead of her but her expanding middle prevents her from getting past bleekers mom
they share an extremely awkward moment wedged side by side in the narrow hallway
bleeckers mom nudges past juno and knocks on bleekers bedroom door
the door has a cheesy racecar themed decoration hanging on it that says paulies vrrooom
it looks like something a year old might have
paulie is on the floor surrounded by old quizzes studying like the tortured brainiac he is
bleeker opens the bedroom door
paulie jumps startled
hey dont concentrate so hard man
i think i smell hair burning
bleeker smiles faintly
she closes the door halfway and leaves
juno rolls her eyes and pulls the door shut entirely
i just wanted to come over
you know say hi
i miss hanging out with you on school nights
i miss it too
he nervously cracks open a container of orange tic tacs and pours them into his mouth
orange tic tacs are bleekers one and only vice
when we made out the day i got pregnant his mouth tasted really tangy and delicious
bleeker glances at junos midsection embarrassed
so it looks like youre getting pregnant er these days
um i hooked up a whole private adoption thing
these married people in saint cloud are going to be the parents
bleeker is visibly relieved
what are they like
the guy is super cool
his name is mark and hes into old horror movies and he plays guitar
i actually hung out with him today
is that normal
i asked my dad and bren not to narc us out to your folks so we should be safe
thats a relief
juno walks over to the bed and sits down next to bleeker
im going to really start looking like a dork soon
will you still think im cute if im huge
i always think youre cute
i think youre beautiful
juno is caught off guard by his sincerity
well i do
the song playing ends and another one begins
its the song the track that bleeker and juno both recognize from the infamous night in the basement
hey junebug when all this is over we should get the band back together again
once tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go
we could get back together too
were we together
bleeker picks at the carpet dejected
well we were once
you know that time
what about katrina de voort
you could go out with katrina de voort
i dont like katrina
i totally heard you did
katrina smells like soup
her whole house smells of soup
the house is covered in fresh snow
mark and vanessa stand silently in the nursery
the walls are primed slate gray
a single antique rocking chair sits in the corner
vanessa beams proudly and holds two paint samples up near the wall
what do you think
custard or cheesecake
well i wanted to pick something gender neutral for now
once we get the baby god willing we can create a more decisive palette
why do people think yellow is gender neutral
i dont know one man with a yellow bedroom
i think im leaning toward custard in this light
i dont know
i should paint a small area
or you could just wait a couple months
its not like the babys going to storm in here any second and demand dessert colored walls
what to expect says that readying the babys room is an important process for women
its called nesting
are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva
you should read the book
i even flagged the daddy chapters for you
i just think its too early to paint
thats my opinion
and i disagree
mark shrugs resigned
vanessa points to the nurserys largest wall
that wall is going to need something
maybe we could put our first family picture there
can you see it
mark stares at the wall looking lost
juno and leah are walking through the mall looking bored
juno is wearing one of macs giant hockey jerseys in lieu of actual maternity wear
leah gnaws on a giant cinnamon pretzel
this pretzel tastes like a friggin donut
share the love tits
she wrestles leah for the pretzel
onlookers stare at them appalled as leah puts juno in a half nelson
to eavesdroppers shes assaulting me
shes denying me fresh baked goodness
leah claps a hand over junos mouth
muffled hly shht
juno drags leah behind a pillar and peers out from behind it
theyre watching a group of well heeled women and their children shopping en masse
one of the women is pushing a toddler in an ultramodern stroller
and one of the women is vanessa looking vaguely detached
hushed thats her
thats vanessa loring
of the penny saver lorings
you sound shocked or something
i just thought shed look really old in real life
the women gather near a play area sip frapps and loudly discuss their outfits for an upcoming party
and i was like no offense sweetie but nobody looks good in gauchos
especially not with her build
mimicking the women peanuts style wah wah waaah
one of the little girls in the group tugs at vanessas sleeve
vanessa happily follows the little girl over to their play area and begins to play energetically with her
juno watches intently but leah just snickers
shes gonna steal that kid for her collection
they watch vanessa for a few more moments
the other kids wander over toward the play area while their mothers ignore them
vanessa continues to entertain the children
leah stands up
juno lingers for a moment
leah and juno approach the elevator
i want a huge cookie
and like a lamb kebob
must you always feed
the elevator door opens revealing
juno tries her best to look enthused
well hi vanessa
what brings you to the mall today
just you know shopping with my girlfriends
juno glares at leah
please excuse leah
shes mentally challenged
how are you feeling
oh you mean like physically
look i have a snooze button now
she lifts her shirt and presses her popped out navel
vanessa is admiring the belly when juno grimaces
dude its moshing all over
vanessa looks confused
explains its kicking
vanessa nods in understanding then begins summoning the courage for an unusual request
juno can i can i touch it
are you kidding
everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly
im like a legend
they call me the cautionary whale
she grabs vanessas hand and plants it on her stomach
i cant feel anything
vanessa moves her hand wanting desperately to feel the baby
its not moving for me
she says this as though its an admission of failure
oh you should try talking to it
they can apparently hear speech in there even though it sounds all ten thousands leagues under the sea
vanessa kneels down next to the swell of junos belly
my name is vanessa
i cant wait to meet you
leah gives a look to juno as if shes about to barf
can you hear me sweet angel
vanessa looks like shes giving up hope
then suddenly oh my god it moved
i felt it
juno smiles at vanessa in awe of her genuine affection
the streets are covered in muddy slushy snow
the mud is instantly trampled underfoot by the collective feet of the dancing elk track team on their morning run
bren cuts the top three inches off a pair of junos jeans
then using a sewing machine begins attaching an elastic waistband
were behind that same waistband as juno walks through the students
now people seem to part the waters for the belly
mark has the les paul on his lap as he stares at the boards of an awful commercial
cu the script storyboards
a kitchen scene with a kid eating a new breakfast product called brunch bowlz
annoyed and out of ideas mark begins an impromptu song
mark drops his head dejected
then the phone rings
picks up hello
so ive been spending a lot of time listening to that weird cd you made me
mark instantly smiles
whats the verdict
i sort of like it
i mean its cute
well when youre used to the raw power of iggy and the stooges everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison
i imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point
consider it your musical education
im dying to see what youve got to teach me
okay stop surfing porn and get back to work
just wanted to say hi
go learn something
mark hangs up
cu on junos tray sliding along picking up an odd combo of pregnant food
pull up to find juno and leah walking their trays to a table
god youre getting huge
how many months has it been now
you wouldnt believe how weird i look naked
i wish my funbags would get bigger
trust me you dont
i actually have to wear a bra now
and i have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode
juno and leah are sitting inside an emptied awards case on the wall eating their lunch
juno notices that the other kids in the cafeteria cant help but glance her way
some look derisive others are amused
god why is everyone always staring at me
well you are kind of
she illustrates by making a rounded gesture near her stomach
wow someones been actually doing her geometry homework for once
i dont have a choice
keiths been grading me really hard lately
please do not refer to mr
conyers as keith okay
my barf reflex is already heightened these days
eww hes all beardy
we see keith the teacher talking to some science kids in the background
he has a wild america beard
he lifts a cup of coffee to his lips and slurps lustily
did you hear bleek is going to prom with katrina de voort
pfft no way
he doesnt like katrina
it must be a pity date
shrugging he asked her
i heard they were going to benihana then the prom then to vijays parents cabin
bleeker told me katrinas whole house reeks of soup
oh it totally does
i was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like lipton landing
but you know boys have endured worse things for nookie
theres no way in hell theyre having sex or even holding hands
i wouldnt be so sure about that
he did it with you
hes a man now
yeah well bleek trusted me
were best friends
are you jealous
i thought you said you didnt care what he did
im not jealous and i dont care
i just know he doesnt like katrina and i dont think he should toy with her emotions like that
she seems so nice and all
okay juno im really convinced
prom is for wenises anyway
once youre old enough to go its not cool anymore
bleeker retrieves a book from his open locker
juno marches up to him belly leading the way
are you honestly and truly going to prom with katrina de voort
leah just told me you were going with her
yeah i did ask her if she wanted to go
a bunch of us from the team are going to benihana then the prom then vijays parents cabin
juno is clearly affronted
meekly were getting a stretch limo
your mom must be really glad youre not taking me
why are you mad
im not mad
im in a fucking great mood
despite the fact that im trapped in a fat suit i cant take off despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back despite the fact
that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday
katrinas not my girlfriend
and i doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye
she just looks like that all the time
a girl strides past obviously katrina with a sour look aimed squarely at juno
have fun at the prom with soupy sales
im sure i can think of something way more cool to do that night
like i could pumice my feet or go to brens dumb unitarian church or get hit by a ten ton truck full of hot garbage juice
all those things would be exponentially cooler than going to the prom with you
she starts to walk away
bleeker takes a deep breath
youre being really immature
turning around what
bleeker braces himself and pushes up his lab goggles
thats not how our thing works
i hurl the accusations and you talk me down remember
not this time
you dont have any reason to be mad at me
you broke my heart
i should be royally ticked at you man
i should be really cheesed off
i shouldnt want to talk to you anymore
because i got bored and had sex with you one day and then i didnt like marry you
like id marry you
you would be the meanest wife of all time
and anyway i know you werent bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on tv
the blair witch project was on starz and you were like oh i want to watch this but we should make out instead
la la la
forget it bleek
take katrina the douche packer to the prom
im sure you guys will have a really bitchin time
searching for a comeback yeah well
i still have your underwear
i still have your virginity
looking around panicked oh my god shut up
are you ashamed that we did it
well at least you dont have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater
im a planet
juno picks up her backpack dejectedly and slides it over her shoulder
shes about to walk away when
wait let me take that
you shouldnt be carrying that heavy bag
ill take it
whats another ten pounds
she turns around wipes tears off her cheek making sure no one sees and continues down the hallway
juno climbs ungracefully into the van
she starts the engine then pauses to dig through her backpack for something
she produces a brush and begins brushing her hair in the rearview mirror examining herself self consciously
she puts on some dr
pepper lip smacker and backs out of the driveway
mark is seated at the computer surfing a horror movie website
he has the blank expression of a bored obsessive
the doorbell rings
mark opens the door
juno stands there looking radiantly knocked up
she holds a stack of cds
mark breaks into a grin
that shirt is working hard
furtive is vanessa here
he and juno smile conspiratorially
come on i have something for you
he gestures for juno to follow him into the house
the lorings basement is dank cluttered unfinished and unattractive much like paulie bleekers
mark pulls a chain to illuminate a bare bulb
is this the babys room
no i just keep all of my old comics down here and i want to show you one of them
oh god youre one of those guys
youre gonna like this i promise
mark rummages through a cardboard box in the corner
extracting a bagged comic from the box here it is
he shows the comic to juno
its called most fruitful yuki
it depicts a pregnant japanese girl kicking ass and taking names
most fruitful yuki
oh my god shes a pregnant superhero
isnt that great
i got it when i was in japan with my band
she reminds me of you
juno examines the comic
most fruitful yuki does resemble her
wow i actually feel like less of a fat dork now
most fruitful yuki is bad ass man
you should be proud to be the same condition
she throws a karate kick in marks direction with a kee ya
juno is sincerely pleased
okay how about some tunes
theres a battered portable cd player in the corner
juno kneels down and pops in one of the discs
now this first one is kinda slow
but its mott the hoople so its still totally rad and hardcore
juno puts in the cd and all the young dudes fills the room
i actually know this one
yeah this songs older than me if you can believe that
i danced to it at my senior prom
thats almost interesting mark
who did you dance with
her name was cynthia vogel and she was a good dance partner
even let me put my hands on her butt
oh man i can just picture you slow dancing like a dork
she mockingly places her hands on marks waist and moves back and forth stiffly
no i put my hands on your waist
then you put your arms around my neck
thats how we did it in
mark puts his hands on what remains of junos waist
she drapes her arms around his neck self consciously
youve never been to a dance have you
casually defensive only squares and nerds go to dances
what are you
i dont know
they sway slowly to the music
junos belly bumps up against mark
i feel like theres something between us
juno rests her head on marks chest
they dance in silence for a few moments then stop moving
mark pulls juno as close as he possibly can given her expanding girth
im leaving vanessa
quiet at first what
its just not working out but im getting my own place in the city
and ive got it all planned out
its something ive wanted to do for a long time
juno backs away
no you definitely cannot do that mark
thats a big fat sack of no
whats the matter
this isnt what we agreed on
you guys have to take care of
you are the chosen custodians of the big ass bump
she gestures wildly to her belly
suddenly something matters to her far more than the approval of an older guy
but i thought youd be cool if
interrupting i want you guys to adopt the buglet
i wanted everything to be perfect
not shitty and broken like everyone elses family
listen once i have the baby vanessa is going to finally be happy and everything will be all right
believe me on this one
a baby is not going to fix everything
besides i dont know if im ready to be a father
aghast but youre old
how do you think of me juno
why are you here
i dont know
i just liked being your friend
i sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life
he gestures to the dank surrounding room this is what my life has become
stuff in boxes
is that so appealing to you
yeah i guess
is this my fault
is vanessa mad at you because of me
thats not the point
were just not in love anymore
yeah but didnt you love vanessa when you married her
if you love someone once you can love them again i know it
my friend leah has gone out with the same guy like four times
youre just not trying
mark suddenly sees juno for what she is a teenage girl
im such an idiot
i cant believe what an idiot i am
he paces over to the wall and kicks it softly
please dont get a divorce
god mark just do me a solid and stay with your wife
god youre so young
im old enough to tell when people are acting like total a holes
juno turns to leave then shoots one furious look back at mark
oh and by the way i bought another sonic youth album and its the worst thing ive ever heard
its just noise man
she bolts up the stairs sobbing
juno reaches the top of the stairs and scrambles toward the front door only to be intercepted by vanessa whos returning home from work carrying her briefcase and a freshly
purchased nursing pillow
they nearly collide
whats going on
its obvious from junos tears and flushed face that shes lying
vanessa instantly goes pale with fear but she tries her hardest to seem serene and together in front of juno
pretending to be calm mark
why is juno crying
im not crying
im allergic to fine home furnishings
see you later
she rushes toward the door
juno whats the matter
its just part of the whole process
juno looks totally betrayed
she doesnt respond
vanessa looks at junos expression and knows mark is lying
what did you do
i didnt do anything
ive just been thinking
youve been thinking
just thinking if this is really the right thing for us
what are you referring to
she knows exactly to what hes referring
ive been just wondering if were you know ready
of course were ready
weve taken all the classes
the books i know were prepared
i just dont know if
junos face continues to fall
to juno juno dont worry about this
he just has cold feet
thats how boys are
the books all say the same thing
a woman becomes a mother when she gets pregnant
a man becomes a father when he sees his baby
hes going to get there
hell get there
juno aint buying it
to mark why dont we let juno go home and we can discuss this later on okay
it all just happened so fast
we put that ad in the paper
i thought it would take months if you know ever and then boom two weeks later shes in our living room
quietly she answered our prayers
ignores the comment ever since its just been like a ticking clock
this stops vanessa
juno looks offended
what are you saying
a long hideous beat
it just feels a little like bad timing
another hideous beat
what would be a good time for you
i dont know
theres just things i still want to do
be a rock star
dont mock me
youre trying to do something thats never going to happen
and you know what
your shirt is stupid
if i have to wait for you to become kurt cobain im never going to be a mother
vanessa looks defeated
i never said id be a great father
we hear the front door closing
vanessa and mark look over and notice that juno has escaped the conflict
juno runs up to her car sobbing
she struggles with the keys but finally makes it into the previa and drives off
the previa slides off the road and comes to a stop on the shoulder
juno buckles over the steering wheel crying unwinding for the first time since she became pregnant
after a beat she begins to gather herself
bleeker is sitting next to his bed noodling on the guitar
hes playing a theme that we will soon recognise
juno lays on the hood of her previa contemplating her future
we push in close
when she gets an idea
she hops off the hood and scurries into the previa where she finds a crumpled up jiffy lube receipt
she unfolds it and pulls out a pen ready to write something
its quiet after the storm
inside we see vanessa sitting alone at her perfect dining room table drinking a glass of wine
vanessa takes a sip and continues to let the days events sink in
after a beat mark comes down the stairs to join her
i called gerta rauss
she says she can represent both of us
they call it collaborative divorce
its apparently all the rage right now
and its easy because we dont have children
no its fine
thanks for making the call i guess
mark nods and sits down
were actually finally doing this
looks like it yeah
have you found a place to stay
its a loft
lightly teasing arent you the cool guy
they stare at the wall speechless and defeated
i wanted a baby so bad
she buries her head in her hands
i know you did
theres a loud knock on the front door
mark opens the door
theres a folded piece of paper sitting on the doormat
he squints and sees juno pulling away in the van
mark carefully unfolds the piece of paper it takes a minute because of junos proficiency in teen girl origami
he holds it up
we can see theres writing on the back
it looks like a bill from jiffy lube
vanessa takes the note from his hand and turns it over examining it
its for me
juno parks her car and walks up to her house
a porch lights been left on for her and the place looks cozy and inviting
i never realize how much i like being home unless ive been somewhere really different for a while
she picks a crocus from the unkempt garden near the porch and sniffs it
she lifts her shirt and tickles her belly with it
then she tucks the flower into her unkempt hair
mac is alone at the kitchen table going over the family finances while drinking one of brens weight loss shakes
hey big puffy version of junebug
where have you been
dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level
where is everyone
bren took liberty bell to her tot ice skating class
tot ice skating
tots cant ice skate
liberty bells still getting the hang of stairs
no but you know bren
she dreams big
yeah she does
you look a little morose honey
whats eating you
im losing my faith in humanity
think you can narrow it down for me
i guess i wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good
you mean like couples
yeah like people in love
are you having boy trouble
i gotta be honest i dont much approve of you dating in your condition cause
well thats kind of messed up
well its kind of skanky
isnt that what you girls call it
please stop now
persisting tore up from the floor up
dad its not about that
i just need to know that its possible for two people to stay happy together forever
or at least for a few years
its not easy thats for sure
now i may not have the best track record in the world but i have been with your stepmother for ten years now and im proud to say that were
juno nods in agreement
in my opinion the best thing you can do is to find a person who loves you for exactly what you are
good mood bad mood ugly pretty handsome what have you the right person will still think that the sun shines out your ass
thats the kind of person thats worth sticking with
a wave of realization crosses junos face
i sort of already have
well of course
your old d a d
you know ill always be there to love and support you no matter what kind of pickle youre in
he nods toward her belly
juno laughs and hugs her father planting a smooch on his cheek
i need to go out somewhere for just a little while
i dont have any homework and i swear ill be back by ten
she salutes and dashes out of the kitchen
you were talking about me right
we push in over bleeker sleeping in his car bed towards the window
we look out onto the lawn to find juno and leah running back to the previa hopping in and screeching off
bleeker steps out of the house for his usual early morning run
he looks down to see a message scrawled in chalk on the stoop bleeker check the mail
he walks down to the end of the driveway and opens the latch on the mailbox
at least one hundred containers of orange tic tacs come pouring out in an colorful deluge
they spill out onto the driveway
juno waddles toward the field
the guys on the track team ridiculously arrayed as usual are doing hurdler stretches
they stare at her quizzically
bleeker spots juno approaching and jogs up to the chainlink fence
did you put like a hundred things of tic tacs in my mailbox
that was me
blushes because theyre your fave
and you can never have too much of your favorite one calorie breath mint
i think im pretty much set until college on the tic tac front
you know ive been thinking
im really sorry i was such a huge bitch to you
you didnt deserve that
you never deserve any of the poo i unload on you
you know its okay
also i think im in love with you
what you mean as friends
no for real
i think you are the coolest person ive ever met
and you dont even have to try
i try really hard actually
no youre naturally smart
you always think of the funniest things to do
remember when you passed me that postcard during spanish class and it was addressed like junebug macguff row third seat from the blackboard
and it said im having fun in barcelona wish you were here
that was hilarious
i was just bored
i only think school is awesome like of the time
plus youre the only person who doesnt stare at my stomach all the fucking time
you actually look at my face
and every time i look at you the baby starts kicking me super hard
juno presses bleekers hand against her belly
i think its because my heart starts pounding when i see you
basically im completely smitten with you and i dont care if im making an ass out of myself right now because youve seen me make an ass out of myself
a million times and you still want to be my friend
youre the best friend ive ever had even when youre being kind of evil
thats all i need from you
thats more than i could ever ask for
youre just golden dude
can we make out now
bleeker and juno kiss oblivious to the gawking track team guys in the background
in the distance near the school entrance we see steve rendazo the kid who always torments juno regarding the makeout session with a sad envious expression
leah passes by does a double take then hurries up to the fence rolling her eyes
disgusted you know you can go into early labor sucking face like that
juno gives her the finger not breaking the clinch with bleeker
juno is lying on her back on the bed staring at the ceiling
shes more pregnant than weve ever seen her
she revs a matchbox car against the slope of her belly and lets it roll
juno suddenly sits up looking thoroughly freaked
she pats her lap frantically and jumps off the bed
mac looks up from the lure hes working on
either i just pissed my pants or
thundercats are go
mac bren and liberty bell rush out of the house
they pile into the previa at breakneck speed
juno waddles behind them protesting
cu of juno wearing a puffy surgical cap
shes being pushed down the hospital corridor in a wheelchair
she bursts into giggles
pull back to reveal her that leah is pushing her rather aggressively
leah jokingly steers the wheelchair into a wall
juno feigns whiplash
bren appears behind them and orders juno out of the wheelchair exasperated
she pulls off junos surgical cap
leah and juno snicker
we see juno is in a birthing suite at the hospital pacing impatiently bent over in obvious discomfort
shes wearing her chuck taylors and knee socks with her hospital gown
leah and bren stand nearby
juno doubles over in pain
panicked ow ow fuckity ow
bren when do i get that spinal tap thing
its called a spinal block and you cant have it yet honey
the doctor said youre not dilated enough
you mean i have to wait for it to get even worse
why cant they just give it to me now
well honey doctors are sadists who like to play god and watch lesser people scream
juno lets out a genuine shriek of pain
checking her watch shit
to the doctor hey can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already
it really didnt hurt that bad having him
we see juno in the process of delivery from her pov
leah holds one of junos feet and bren holds the other
the best part was when i peed on leah during labor
we see leah holding junos foot which is shaking
leahs shirt is soaked
she rolls her eyes and mouths fuck you at juno
junos raised middle finger enters the frame
and then out of nowhere there it was
the doctor reveals junos baby boy above the sheet
there he was
juno looks at the baby in awe then her eyes begin to flutter
and she passes out
paulie bleeker is running as fast as his legs can carry him on the dancing elk track
theres a very sparse crowd in the bleachers
as paulie approaches the tape his envious teammate vijay looks on
bleekers mom is seated near vijay holding a video camera
i decided to not call bleeker to tell him that i was having the baby
he had a big meet against manteno and i didnt want him to get all worried about me and choke
paulie breaks the tape winning the race
the fifteen or so people in attendance cheer
admiringly his legs are as swift as his seed
what did you say
bleeker pants at the finish line dripping with sweat
bleeker has just broken a district record in the
bleeker looks out at the bleachers scanning them for juno
shes not there
but he figured it out anyway
bleek takes off running toward the parking lot without stopping to explain
his mother stands up confused
a nurse reaches into one of the maternity ward bassinets and gently lifts up a swaddled newborn baby
the nurse turns and addresses an unseen spectator
would you like to meet your son
pull back to reveal shes speaking to vanessa who stands paralyzed several feet away
i have a son
amused you are the adoptive mother
i have a son
healthy kid too
didnt waste any time getting out
vanessa reaches out for the baby and gingerly accepts him in her eyes
she spends a few moments just looking at him
she feels someone watching her then looks up to see a bren leaning against the doorway
vanessa blinks away her tears self consciously
how do i look
gently like a mom
juno is curled up on her bed in the birthing room
the birth is obviously over theres that air of stillness and accomplishment a task completed
the doctors have cleared out
mac sits in a chair next to the bed looking like hes not sure what to say
he holds up a deck of playing cards as if to initiate a game but juno gently pushes his hand away
their eyes meet
his expression is helpless hers is utterly drained
someday youll be back here honey
on your terms
juno nods and swallows
over macs shoulder a silhouette appears in the doorway
its bleeker in his track uniform
juno sees him and bursts into sudden ragged sobs
mac glances at her alarmed
paulie moves toward the bed
mac clears his throat gets up and leaves the room
paulie climbs onto the hospital bed and carefully puts his arm around juno
she leans into him letting herself go for the first time in months
juno lies on the bed
she looks rested and relaxed compared to her earlier crying jag but her face is still pink and swollen
bleeker is curled up next to her still in his track uniform and spikes
bleeker decided he didnt want to see the baby
neither did i really
he didnt feel like ours
we see vanessa leaning over the bassinet unable to take her eyes off the baby touching its hair reverently
i think he was always hers
the nursery is perfectly decorated in vanessas immaculate taste
nothing looks as though its been touched
we see the antique rocking chair sitting empty
it ended with a chair
we pan past the wall vanessa had said needed something
theres a framed note on the wall
it looks like it was handwritten on the back of a jiffy lube bill
we see that it says vanessa if youre still in im still in
we move to the door and get a view of vanessas bedroom
we see her lying in bed with a burp cloth draped over her shoulder feeding the baby
for the first time ever vanessa looks disorganized unshowered and incredibly happy
there are formula bottles on the bedside table and a bassinet pushed close to the bed
obviously she hasnt been away from the baby for a single moment
the baby reaches up and grabs vanessas thumb
vanessa glows with an expression of pure bliss
its a sparkling summer afternoon
juno wheels her bicycle out of the detached garage
she waves goodbye to bren who is playing in the yard with two weimaraners
she looks almost as happy with her dogs as vanessa looked with her baby
juno rides her bike aggressively down the street
her guitar is slung over her shoulder in a gig bag
shes obviously not pregnant anymore
she looks happy but older
as boyfriends go paulie bleeker is totally boss
he is the cheese to my macaroni
i know people are supposed to fall in love before they reproduce but normalcys not really our style
as she tears recklessly down the street on her bikes she passes the dancing elk track team still running in outrageously skimpy shorts and bandanas
juno rides up to a garage where bleeker is sitting tuning his guitar
juno bikes up to find bleeker sitting on the stoop
she smiles and takes out her guitar
she sits across from bleeker and pulls the pick out of the strings
juno begins strumming her guitar and playing anyone else but you by the moldy peaches
bleeker joins in
at first their playing is discordant but suddenly it works
youre a part time lover and a fulltime friend
the monkey on your back is the latest trend
i dont see what anyone can see in anyone else but you
here is the church and here is the steeple
we sure are cute for two ugly people
i dont see what anyone can see in anyone else but you
we both have shiny happy fits of rage
you want more fans i want more stage
i dont see what anyone can see in anyone else but you
you are always trying to keep it real
im in love with how you feel
i dont see what anyone can see in anyone else but you
i kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train
i kiss you all starryeyed my bodys swinging from side to side
i dont see what anyone can see in anyone else but you
the pebbles forgive me the trees forgive me
so why cant you forgive me
i dont see what anyone can see in anyone else but you
du du du du du du dudu
du du du du du du dudu
i dont see what anyone can see in anyone else but you
she and bleeker exchange glances as they play
they smile ambiguously
juno leans over and kisses bleeker on the cheek
pull out to reveal the surrounding green suburb buzzing with life and summer activity
