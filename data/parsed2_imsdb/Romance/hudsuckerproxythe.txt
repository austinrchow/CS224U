a bleak wind moans
with a stinging chord we lights twinkle
the wind moans
after a beat the voice of an elderly black man thes right
we are tracking high through the night sky
from the streets far below we hear the sounds of traffic muffled by the falling snow and the distant sound of many voices singing
we are drifting among the buildings the tops of skyscrapers slip by left and right
its anyway for a few mo minutes it is
come midnight its gonna be
a whole nother feelin
the new year
the singing a little more audible but still not close is auld lang syne
yeah ole daddy earth fixin to start one mo trip round the sun an evvybody hopin this ride round be a little mo giddy a little mo gay
we are moving in towards a particular skyscraper
at its top is a large illuminated clock
we hear a series of popping sounds
all over town champagne corks is a poppin
a big band waltz mixes up on the track
over in the waldorf the big shots is dancin to the strains of guy lombardo
down in times square the little folks is a watchin and a waitin fo that big ball to drop
the lombardo music gives way to the chanting of a distant crowd sixty
they all tryin to catch holt a one moment of time
the chanting has mixed back down again to leave only the wind
still tracking in toward the top of the skyscraper we begin to hear the tick of its enormous clock
the clock reads a minute to twelve
above it in neon a companys name hudsucker industries
below it in neon the companys motto the future is now
to be able to say right now
this is it
i got it
course by then itll be past
more cheerfully but they all happy evvybody havin a good time
we are moving in on a darkened penthouse window next to the clock
the window starts to open
well almost evvybody
theys a few lost souls floatin round out there
a young man is crawling out of the window onto the ledge
with the opening of the window auld lang syne filters out with greater volume
this ones norville barnes
the man gingerly straightens up on the ledge
he is perhaps in his late twenties
he wears a leather apron
printed on the apron hudsucker mail room the future is now
he looks with nervous determination into the void
lets move in for a closer look
the camera obliges
we track in slowly ending very close
that office he jes stepped out of is the office of the president of hudsucker industries
its his office
norville sways in anguish as the ticking of the clock grows louder and the wind blows in his face
howd he get so high
an why is he feelin so low
is he really gonna do it is norville really gonna jelly up the sidewalk
norville is tensing his body peering out over the ledge preparing to make a swan dive into oblivion but the cameras continued movement is losing him from frame
we are moving in on the enormous clock whose mechanical thrum becomes very loud indeed
well the future thats something you cant never tell about
the second hand of the clock is nearing the twelve bare seconds to midnight
distant chanting from times square mixes up nine
but the past
thats another story
the hum of the clock sinks under the hiss of an airbrake and grinding gears as we
on the front of a bus just rocking to a halt
the display says muncie new york
is being set out on the pavement
a man with the cuffs of a redcap uniform swings one into the f
it has a sticker on it class of and below an illustration of crossed right and left hands their thumbs hooked and fingers spread like wings muncie college of after
a beat the hand of its claimant enters to pick it up
following the bag as its owner carries it down the street
he pauses sets it down
fresh faced eager norville barnes
he is gazing off at the sign is over a ground floor office an exterior clock shows
a curtain is just being pulled open in its picture window to reveal a great job board
it is like the departures board in a great train station with each of its individual entries flipping over occasionally to reveal a new opportunity
on offer are jobs like pastry chef steamfitter lay out man gravedigger etc
on the small crowd gathered to like norville watch the board men in search of jobs of various classes and vocations but alike in their intent gaze their hands dug
into their pockets their hats pushed back on their heads bobbing occasionally to get a better view of the chattering board
men occasionally head for the office as they see a prospect they like
norville stands pat watching
an entry flips over to reveal executive vice president
we pan along the executive entry to experience required
around him the crowd is thinning out as men trot in to apply for their respective jobs
we see other entries junior executive
pan to experience the cross cutting ends in a wash of super impositions panning over norviille now alone on the sidewalk a middle aged mousy looking man in a conservative
suit and wire rimmed spectacles is addressing his remarks to someone o
behind the executive we see only the skyline of new york city
so in the third quarter we saw no signs of weakening
were up percent over last years third quarter gross and needless to say thats a new record
down the length of the board room table
executives line either side
we are approaching the man at the far end of the table to whom the report is being directed
he is late middle aged dressed expensively but conservatively his attention smilingly fixed on the executive who drones on
the competition continues to flag and we continue to take up the slack
market share in most divisions is increasing and weve opened seven new regional offices
the track has ended in a closeup of the man at the end of the table who still smiles benignantly at the droning executive
the smile is serene almost otherwordly
this is waring hudsucker
he drones on
our international division has also shown vigorous upward movement in the past six months and were looking at some exciting things in the camera slowly pans off the droning executive
as the big mans attention apparently wanders we frame up on the picture window skyline of new york
dont talk to me about sub franchising were making so much money in sub franchising it isnt even funny
a hand with pencil goes down a list of positions ticking each one streetsweeper experienced linotype man norville sitting at a coffeeshop counter sets the pencil down
his chin is sunk disconsolately into his palm
his hat is pushed back dejectedly on his head
he idly stirs his coffee with his spoon
he takes one last gulp of the coffee then sets the cup down on the want ads stands and digs into his pocket for change turning it inside out
as norville puts all his change on the counter
his hand hesitates he takes a little of it back
he leaves frame
a waitresss hand enters from the far side of the counter
she clears away the saucer then the cup which has been resting on the want ads
it leaves a perfect brown circle around one entry start building yours at hudsucker industries
apply personnel madison avenue
as we hear the coffeeshop door opening o
a draft wafts the sheet of newspaper off the counter and out of frame
again looking through the window as o
the reporting executive drones on
our owned and operateds are performing far above expectations both here and abroad and the federal tax act of is giving us a swell writeoff on our plant and heavies
looks dreamily out the window
his attention returns to the droning executive and the benignant smile returns to his lips
the news in the money market isnt good its excellent
he walks dejectedly down the street hands shoved into his pockets
a sheet of newspaper eddies into frame
the wind tosses it this way and that
it plasters against another pedestrian who bats it away
the newspaper eddies around some more then plasters against norville
he peels it off and is about to toss it away but stops noticing something
it is a section of the want ads
one entry is perfectly circled by a coffee stain
he looks up from the paper
there is purpose in his gaze
wind whips his hair
as the executive drones on o
hudsucker is carefully winding his wristwatch
our nominees and assigns continue to multiply and expand extending our influence regionally nationally and globally
so third quarter and year to date weve set a new record for sales
hudsucker looks up from his watch smiles runs his palms back over his fringe of hair
new record in gross
hudsucker pulls his sleeve cuffs to expose just the right amount under the suit
new record in pre tax earnings
hudsucker takes one puff from his cigar and carefully sets it in his ashtray
new record in after tax profit
he deliberately unstraps his wristwatch and looks at its face
the sweep second hand is starting the last revolution that will end at precisely noon
and our stock has split twice this year
hudsucker lays the watch carefully on the table
savoring a pause the executive looks around the board table
this draws an appreciative chuckle from the board
it is cut off by ahem
the board turns expectantly to hudsucker who sits in the f
beyond him is the length of the board table and the large picture window
he rises to his feet slowly and deliberately and rubs his palms together
he swings his chair out
he steps up onto the chair
the board stares
he steps up from the chair onto the board table
the heads of the board members swing up in unison
hudsucker is framed from mid torso down
he shakes the tension loose from each leg then waggles both arms dangling at his sides like an athlete preparing for a sprint
start building yours at hudsucker industries
apply personnel madison avenue
the hand holding the paper drops away and we tilt up as norville walks away from us into the b
towards the office building across the street
its street number tops its imposing entryway in large gilt letters
we continue tilting up the length of the skyscraper to reveal a huge clock capping its facade
above the clock is the identification hudsucker industries
below the clock is the motto the future is now
the huge clocks sweep second hand is just approaching the position that will make the time sharp
as the second hand hits the twelve the clock tolls the board room window shatters and waring hudsucker comes flying out
somewhere in the hudsucker building
a secretary sits typing next to an open window finished pages sitting stacked beside her
as we hear another toll of the clock
as hudsucker shoots past the window his draft sends the stack of papers wafting this way and that
as the secretary turns to look out the window freeze frame wafting papers have their motion arrested and super a title
with hudsucker the building slipping by behind him
as he yells he calmly runs his palms back over his fringe of hair
the clock tolls
freeze frame and super a title
on the street handing a steaming frank to a customer who is handing him some change
as we hear the approaching hudsucker both men look up
as the clock tolls freeze frame and super a title
the man wearing a fedora is in the f
of an extreme low angle whose b
is the bottom three or four stories of the hudsucker building
the passerby reacts to the approaching yell looking up just as hudsucker enters frame
freeze frame to suspend hudsucker a good twenty feet above the sidewalk arms and legs splayed comically arrested
the passerby is frozen in an attitude of surprise and disbelief
super the title of the film the hudsucker proxy
unfreeze to send hudsucker plummeting through the frame to his rendezvous with the sidewalk below frame
the hudsucker building lists up into the distance
a woman in a fancy fruited hat with a black veil rises into frame at an opposing slant
looking down at the sidewalk she sends two dismayed hands to her cheek and screeeeeeeeeams
with the last toll of the clock punctuating the cut we are floating in towards the shattered board room window
the womans scream on the street below is faint echoing mixing into the sound of an approaching siren
through the window we see the board members still sitting around the table paralyzed in attitudes of horror and disbelief
all stare at the shattered window in the f
at the far end of the table hudsuckers chair is empty and oddly askew
his cigar still smokes in its ashtray
there are dust footprints down the middle of the long oak table
one executive sits with a pluming cigarette held halfway to his mouth another holds a carafe suspended on its way to his water glass another holds his spectacles inches from
we hear only the hum of the hudsucker clock
sid mussburger enters frame at the window
he is a tall middle aged executive with lean and rugged good looks and a commanding presence
he knocks a last piece of glass out of the sill with his knuckle looks out grunts and draws his head back in
the camera follows him into the room
the other board members heads swivel to watch him all staring searching desperately for some hint as to the fate of their fallen leader
apparently some absurd hope still lingers
mussburger perches on the board table by his own chair
he reaches over to pluck the smoking cigar from the suicides ashtray
pity to waste a whole monte cristo
the other board members unfreeze their worst fears confirmed
he couldve opened the window
waring hudsucker never did anything the easy way
my god why
why did he do it
things were going so well
what am i a headshrinker
maybe the man was unhappy
he didnt look unhappy
yeah well he didnt look rich
waring hudsucker was never an easy man to figure out
reminiscing he built this company with his bare hands
every step he took was a step up
except of course this last one
sure sure he was a swell guy but when the president chairman of the board and holder of eighty seven percent of the companys stock drops forty four floors forty
five counting the mezzanine then the company has a problem
stillson what exactly is the disposition of warings stock
well as you know hud left no will and had no family
the company bylaws are quite clear in that event
his entire portfolio will be converted to common stock and will be sold over the counter as of the first of the fiscal year following his demise
meaning simply that warings stock and control of the company will be available to the public on january first
you mean to tell me that any slob in a smelly t shirt will be able to buy hudsucker stock
the company bylaws are quite clear
how can you discuss his stock when the man has just leapt forty five floors forty four not counting the mezzanine
quit showboating addison the man is gone
the question now is whether were going to let john q
public waltz in and buy percent of our company
whatre you suggesting sidney
certainly we cant afford to buy a controlling interest
not while the stock is this strong
how long before huds paper hits the market
a month at the most
one month to make the blue chip investment of the century look like a round trip ticket on the titanic
we play up the fact that hud is dead
in unison long live the hud
we depress the stock to the point where we can buy fifty percent
not counting the mezzanine
it could work
it should work
it would work
at ticker tape machine its working already
waring hudsucker is abstract art on madison avenue
all we need now is a new president who will inspire real panic in our stockholders
yeah a puppet
mussburger strides across the room from the still chattering ticker tape machine and lowers himself into waring hudsuckers chair
he takes a last puff from his cigar and slowly exhales a cloud of smoke
some jerk we can really push around
that read mailroom
they burst open as norville who wears a mail clerks leather apron imprinted hudsucker mailroom the future is now
the hellish mailroom is criss crossed by pipes that emit hissing jets of steam
as he wheels a piled high mail cart down the aisle norville is accompanied by an orientation agent who bellows at him over the clamor and roar of many men
laboring in the bowels of a great corporation

the envelope is addressed to max kloppitt jr

he is coasting across the k mail slots finally comes to max kloppitt sr
his hand moves to the next slot max kloppitt jr
this slot is half the size of all the others
the envelope will not fit in
he is about to fold the envelope but notices something stamped in red on its face
do not fold
as he stares at the envelope we see envelopes swishing across the f
whipping one by one in rapid succession left to right
an old man sitting at the adjacent shelf sorting mail
without ever even looking up with a constant high speed back and forth flicking of his right hand he is whisking pieces of mail one by one out of the
pile of mail in his left hand
as his letters fly furiously but neatly into their mail slots
he raises his voice over the mailroom din say what do you do when the envelope is too big for the slot
the ancient sorter considers this as he continues whisking his mail
if ya fold em they fire ya
i usually throw em out
norville takes out a pencil and writes on the face of the envelope dear mr
kloppit please give this letter to your son
thank you norville barnes
after a moment he adds your friend in the mailroom
talking as he writes just got hired today

for instance take a look at this sweet baby
norville is taking an envelope from his pocket and handing it to the ancient sorter
you look like you can keep a secret
the ancient sorter is pulling a ragged piece of paper from the envelope
on the paper is a crudely drawn circle
something i developed myself
yessir this is my ticket upstairs
the ancient sorter looks questioningly from the circle to norville
explains you know for kids
the ancient sorter nods with feigned understanding as norville takes the paper back
so ya see i wont be in the mailroom long
deadpan nooo i dont guess you will be
he resumes his sorting
how longve you been down here

next year they move me up to parcels
if im lucky
the public address system sputters to life
attention hudsucker employees
we regretfully announce that at this afternoon hudsucker time waring hudsucker founder president and chairman of the board of hudsucker industries merged with the infinite
to mark this occasion of corporate loss we ask that all employees observe a moment of silent contemplation
all hubbub abruptly stops and the sounds of heavy machinery hissing steam pipes and generators wind down to leave total silence
after a moment thank you for your kind attention
this moment has been duly noted on your time cards and will be deducted from your pay
that is all
the machinery groans back into action and the people return to their jobs just as alarm bells go off
from the public address system blue letter
the mail room is thrown into pandemonium
its a blue letter
theyre bringing down a blue letter
one man spins to face the camera his hands pressed over his ears
steam jets and hisses behind him
animated for the first time jumpin jehosephat a blue letter
mail carts and other paraphernalia are abruptly swept out of the crowded aisle to form a clear path running down to an elevator in the b
with a siren sound a light above the elevator goes on
the elevator door sweeps open
it reveals a wall into which a four foot high hinged door is set
this door swings open and an old dwarf emerges old man hutchinson the boss of the mailroom
he emerges from the blinding light of the interior of the elevator
he is holding aloft a letter
he takes loping drawf strides down the aisle
tracking on letter as hutchinson bears it along
in the b
the faces that the letter passes are agog
crosscut the approaching blue letter with norville and the ancient sorter
the ancient sorter is leaning over to whisper into norvilles ear
its a blue letter
top top level
confidential communication between the brass
usually bad news
they hate blue letters upstairs
norville looks over his shoulder but the ancient sorter has disappeared
as he points the people around norville shrink away
you dont look busy
think you can handle a blue letter
laughs sadistically this letter was sent down this morning by the big guy himself
ats right waring hudsucker
its addressed to sid mussburger
hudsuckers right hand man
its a blue letter
that means you put it right in mussburgers hand
dramatic track in on norville
as hutchinson talks he thrusts the blue letter into norvilles face
norville looks at it with terrific apprehension
as hutchinsons speech ends we are tight on norvilles sweating face
we can see the veins in his eyes the veins in his nose the hairs in his ears
we move in on the young elevator operator who leers into camera
he wears a brass buttoned uniform white gloves and a pillbox hat
the name buzz is stitched onto his breast pocket
as norville enters the elevators hiya buddy
the name is buzz i got the fuzz
he lifts his pillbox hat to reveal a white crewcut then lets the elastic chin strap snap the cap back down onto his head
i make the elevator do what she duzz
he holds out his hand but as norville reaches to shake it he snaps it away and pats down his crewcut hang it up to dry
he cackles and powers the elevator into gear
norvilles knees buckle under a huge upward surge buzz is accustomed to it
whats your pleasure buddy
regaining his balance forty fourth floor and its very forty four the top brass floor say buddy
what takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down
na ha ha ha ha
with a powerful down shifting sound buzz brakes the elevator to a sharp halt
norville continues upward with the inertia painfully smacking his head against a corner of the elevator
buzz opens the door and a couple of people enter
kline up to nine
levin thirty seven
ladies and gentlemen step to the rear here comes gargantuan mr
an obese man enters smoking a cigar buzz
buzz has already thrown the doors shut and sent the elevator into its power rise
norville bracing himself now sinks only a little under the g force
whos the most liquid businessman on the street
well i waring hudsucker
na ha ha ha ha
when is the sidewalk fully dressed
when its wearing hudsucker
na ha ha ha
he turns to look at norville
ya get it buddy its a pun its a knee slapper its a play on jesus joseph and mary is that a blue letter
all heads in the elevator turn aghast to look and those near norville shrink away
cripes amighty whynt ya tell a guy
hold on folks were express to the top floor
the elevator screams into overdrive and we sweeping open
norville staggers out
hissing good luck buddy
the door sweeps shut
norville looks nervously around
behind him the elevator doors suddenly open again
youll need it
the elevator doors slam shut and we hear its engines scream as it power dives away
norville turns toward the executive offices
plush thick carpeted silence
norville starts walking
a scraping sound stands out in the high powered executive quiet
norville looks to one side
a workman in painters overalls squats in front of a pair of heavy oak doors
with a razor blade he is scraping off the name waring hudsucker
the scraper looks sullenly over his shoulder at norville
with a jerk of his thumb he indicates the direction
norville enters the adjacent office
two secretaries are in mussburgers outer reception office
the first is a filing secretary who stands frozen in the f
her hand poised over an open drawer to deposit a folder as she stares at norville with an amused and supercilious sneer which stays pasted on throughout
the second secretary the receptionist is seated behind a desk in the b
that flanks the door to mussburgers private office
the receptionist sits with her hands clasped on the desk staring at norville with the hunch shouldered down from under look of a patient vulture
do you have an appointment
uhh no i the filing secretary sneers
shall we look in the book hmmmmmmmmm
she opens an enormous leather bound book with yellowed crinkly pages
no maam ya see i wouldnt be in the we dont seem to be in the boooook
norville is groping in his apron pocket
no maam ya see i dont have an if we had an appointment wed be in the booook
i know but ya see i have this here it is this letter a low unearthly wail fills the room the sound of a million souls moaning in purgatory
the receptionist looks up
who is no longer sneering
her mouth is stretched wide as she wails and her finger points
that norville holds innocently at his side
as her wail becomes deafening and we track into her mouth and the screen goes black and the blackness and the wailing are both cut short by the sound of
a door opening
we are its door swinging open to admit norville
in the b
in the outer office we can see the filing secretary leaning back motionless in a chair with a damp rag draped across her forehead
the receptionist is fanning her with a towel
the door closes behind norville
we hear a rhythmic click click click and the hum of across miles of carpet is a huge executive desk behind which is a large executive chair facing the window
from above the back of the chair cigar smoke wreathes up
a telephone cord snakes around to the man sitting in the chair hidden from us
on the desktop is a perpetual motion machine of large swinging ball bearings
click click click
a tickertape machine occasionally burps information in the far corner of the office
a huge mechanical arm the sweep second hand of the hudsucker clock on the facade of the building rumbles by immediately outside the window describing an arc that throws a
moving shadow across the office
his back to us into the phone sure sure parkinsons stupid but hes ambitious too hard to control
he swivels around to face norville who stands deferentially at the door
still listening at the phone mussburger waves norville forward
not mcclanahan sure he bungled the teleyard merger but that means hes got something to prove
he covers the mouth piece
who let you in
into the phone atwater
except i fired him last week the intercom buzzes fiercely
bumstead is waiting downstairs
mussburger hits the intercom
tell him ill be right there
looks at norville well what is it
but mussburger is listening to the tinny voice issuing from the phone
you maybe youre the companys biggest moron
we cant use morris hes been with us too long hes a nice guy too many friends
matter of fact why dont you fire him
no scratch that ill fire him
looks up at norville make it fast make it fast
you the intercom squawks
bumstead is getting very ill be right there
give him a magazine
to norville whatre you a mute
the second phone on mussburgers desk rings
yeah hows the stock doing
well its not bad enough
into the first phone look chump either you find me a grade a ding dong or you can tender your key to the executive washroom
into the second phone and that goes double for you
into the first phone ear clay
into both phones ood gay
slams down both phones looks at norville this better be good
im in a bad mood
norville clears his throat
ive got something for you from the mailroom but first if i could just take a minute or so from your very busy time
he reaches into his mailroom apron and hands a scrap of paper across the desk to mussburger who stares frozen at norville making no move to take the paper
to show you a uh
norville undaunted holds up the paper since mussburger will not take it
mussburger doesnt even look at it his eyes are locked on norvilles
a little something ive been working on for the last two or three years
mussburgers burning eyes finally shift momentarily to look at the crudely drawn circle he looks back incredulously at norville
you know for kids
which is perfect for hudsucker not that i claim to be any great genius like they say inspiration is percent perspiration and in my case id say its at least
twice that but i gotta tell ya mr
mussburger sir this sweet baby wait a minute
with one last click the perpetual motion ball bearings abruptly stop
as mussburgers eyes burn in on him norville stands mute and paralyzed
his eyes locked on norvilles mussburger circles the desk
he stands toe to toe with norville
he thrusts his face into norvilles whose head moves reflexively back
mussburgers nose is almost touching norvilles his eyes are burning searching studying evaluating
finally he draws his head back
with one hand he thrusts his cigar into norvilles gaping mouth
with his other hand he raises norvilles chin so that his teeth clench it
he steps back eyes still on norville
he jerks his thumb over his shoulder indicating his chair behind the desk
norville his lips puckered around the unaccustomed ciger looks bemusedly from the chair to mussburger
try it on
norville obeys reluctantly stiffly
put your feet up
norville is again reluctant
lets get to know one another shall we
norvilles eyes squint against the cigar smoke wreathing from between his teeth
mussburger seems to relax
beams man to man
you werent blessed with much
he waves vaguely towards his head and searches for a euphemism
education were you
well im a college graduate all right but you didnt excel in your studies
well i made the deans list
norville sputters out some more cigar smoke
at the muncie college of business administration
relieved sure sure
and did your classmates there call you jerk or
searches again schmoe
norville shakes his head
not even behind your back
they voted me most likely to succeed
curtly youre fired
get your feet off that desk
as he struggles to comply but get out of my sight
norville squinting against the cigar smoke pulls the cigar out of his mouth as he doubles forward feet still up groping for a place to set down the cigar
he sets it blindly on a loose stack of papers
the bumstead contracts
oh my god sir
the top page radiates a circle of incipient flame from the cigars live end
i worked for three years on this deal
oh my god sir
norville runs across the office to a large water cooler
ill take care of it
just get out
mussburger plucks the cigar off the contract and tosses it into a wastebasket
he pats the fingertips of one hand against his tongue and then efficiently pats out the crinkling orange circle on the top sheet of the contract
at the other end of the office norville is wrapping his arms around the glass water tank which he pulls off its base
he runs back across the vast expanse of office toward the desk hugging the water tank whose water gloob gloobs out its open bottom and splashes down onto his pumping
as he reaches the desk the near empty tank is now light enough for him to hoist with one arm which he does and cups his other hand under it
to catch its last glub of water
he tosses the tank to the floor where crash it shatters and stands looking about for a place to dump his handful of water
why you nitwit
you almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career
oh my god sir
he is reacting to the wastebasket on his side of the desk which mussburger cannot see
it is sprouting flame at which norville ineffectually flecks his remaining drops of water
now out of here
norville is already running to the window which he runs both palms over desperately seeking a way to open it
not that way
through the door
the windows do not open
norville furiously stomps on the flames in the wastebasket and his foot sticks
further stomping only makes the flaming wastebasket roar up and down with his foot
right away buster
out of my office
norville has dropped to the floor trying to wrench the flaming wastebasket off his leg
up on your feet
we dont crawl at hudsucker industries
sir my leg is on fire
norville finally succeeds in getting the flaming wastebasket off his foot
now the problem is what to do with it
get out of this office you dithering nincompoop
norville picks up the flaming trash receptacle
oh my god sir
he winds up and throws it through the closed window
the glass shatters and the flaming basket plummets to oblivion
with the picture window broken a ferocious draft roars through the penthouse office
on the desk
the pages are sucked away by the draft
the bumstead contracts
oh my god sir
mussburger lunges for the contracts as they are sucked out the window
he runs jumps onto the sill grabs his fist clenches around one wafting page he is about to fall eeeeeeaaaahhhhh
bumstead a short fat heavily perspiring executive is screaming at an o
he holds a pot of coffee in one hand and a copy of boys life in the other
i wanna see mussburger
or did he jump out a window too
in the window behind him we see loose sheets of paper fluttering down
desperately hanging onto mussburger by his legs
dont worry mr
i gotcha by your pants
mussburgers screaming abruptly stops
is in a basement tailor shop
luigi an old italian tailor is just running his tape up mussburgers inseam
meester moosaburger i give a you pants a nice a dooble stitch
make em strong and they look a real sharp
single stitch is fine
begging but please a meester moosaburger the dooble stitch she last a forever why on earth would i need a double stitch
to pad your bill
single stitch is fine
we hear a loud tearing sound o
mussburger drops a few inches
musing to himself what the heck
meester moosaburger such a nice a guy i give him dooble steech a anyway
assa some a strong a steech a you bet
the tearing fabric abruptly catches and stops the rest of the pants hold intact
sighs with relief
he looks up
norvilles arms are wrapped around mussburgers ankles the heels of mussburgers shoes are digging into his face
struggling to hold on
he absently removes a cigar from his breast pocket and sticks it in his mouth
he holds his lighter under the cigar not noticing that the flame is pointing the wrong way
he looks at norville
his face drawn with effort still struggling to hang on
a pull back from the extreme close shot reveals however that norvilles arms are now wrapped around emptiness
mussburgers legs are gone
norville throws his head back and laughs it seems insanely but continued pull back reveals that norville is merely pantomiming the adventure for the benefit of the board members including
they stand around mussburgers office laughing gaily
all safe now no harm done
this inaugurates montage silent but for music
a norville is entertaining the board with his depiction of the near disaster
mussburger is slapping him merrily on the back
b close shot board member laughing
c another board member
e norville laughing
f freeze frame on norvilles laughing face
pull back to reveal that the frozen picture is the newspaper photo on the front page of the manhattan argus
its headline reads untried youth to helm hudsucker
the subhead reads stockholders wary
the sub subhead reads meteoric rise from mailroom
the article is under the byline of amy archer
continued pull back reveals that we are looking at the newspaper over someones shoulder
the person swivels around and away his face now to us we see that it is norville looking at the newspaper
he throws his head back and laughs merrily
as he laughs thwock a steaming towel is thrown onto his face and he continues to swivel
continued pull back reveals that he is in a barber chair
his head drops back and out of frame as the swiveling chair is cranked down but immediately still spinning his head reappears as the chair is cranked up again
still laughing norville is now freshly shaven and has a slicked back haircut heavy with pomade
freeze on norvilles laughing face
pull back to reveal it is another front page photo next to the headline hud board to street give man from muncie a chance
subhead has fresh ideas
continued pull back reveals that the paper is lying on a chair
norvilles mailroom apron is tossed onto the chair to cover it
pan to where the apron was tossed from
norville stands on a tailors stage laughing as the tailor also laughing takes his measurements
norville in shirtsleeves boxer shorts hose stockings and garters
the tailor rises laughing merrily throwing up his arms and spreading them wide with hands stretching the measuring tape
norville laughs merrily and also throws his arms up wide
laughs merrily his arms thrown wide tickertape stretching between his hands
he joyously tosses away the tickertape
where the tickertape lands on a pile of previously discharged tape
pan up to reveal that the tickertape continues to burp its disastrous tale of good news for the board
pan up further to reveal that the machine is in mussburgers office
at the far end of the room behind his desk mussburger laughs as he looks at a newspaper
track in towards him
on his desk the perpetual ballbearings swing outside his window the sweep second hand of the hudsucker clock rumbles by sweeping a shadow across the floor
as mussburger opens the newspaper the continued track in shows its front page headline hud stock dips
subhead just good is he
track in on the front page photo norville laughing his chin propped in his hand
comes to life and norville unfreezes laughing
we are now tracking back from him
he sits behind a huge oak desk newly coifed and tailored
the brass plaque on the desk confirms that he is in the office track back continues through the large elegant office leaving norville looking quite small in long shot
his laughter echoes in the bright bare office
norvilles laughter is just winding down leaving him exhausted as if he has been laughing nonstop for several days
he finally sighs and wipes a tear from his eye
in the skyline we can see the hudsucker building topped by the hudsucker clock
a cigar enters frame in the f
then the face of the man smoking it
staring contemplatively at the hudsucker building he takes a puff from the cigar and then plucks it from his mouth and waves it as if painting a headline
the einstein of enterprise
the edison of industry
the billion dollar cranium
exploding and not one of you mugs has given me a story on him
shows the editors glassed in office filled with reporters for the staff meeting
although they listen quietly they are more bored than attentive
through the glass walls we can see the furious activity of an army of reporters editors and copy boys waging the never ending battle to put out a quality daily
the editor slams a newspaper down onto his desk in disgust
facts figures charts
they never sold a newspaper
i read this mornings edition of the argus and let me tell you something id wrap a fish in it
id use it as kindling
hell id even train my poodle with it if he wasnt a french poodle and more partial to the pages of paree soir
but i sure wouldnt shell out a hard earned nickel to read the dadblamed thing
come on chief give us a break
suuuure tibbs take a break
go to florida
lie in the sun
wait for a coconut to drop file a story on it itll be more of a grabber than your piece on the commie grain surplus
the human angle
thats what sells papers
we need a front page with heart and the whole idea of the idea man idea can put it there
chief if we had more access yeah and if a frog had wings he wouldnt bump his ass a hoppin
i dont want excuses i want results
without even looking in its direction the editor has slammed down the lid of the cigar box on his desk towards which one reporters hand had been idly reaching
the reporter jerks his fingers away as the editor spares the briefest moment to glare at him
i wanna know what makes the idea man tick
where is he from
where is he going
i wanna know everything about this guy
has he got a girl
has he got parents
everybody has parents
all right how many
how bout it parkinson youve been awful quiet over there
still waters run deep chief
the only thing that runs deep with parkinson is the holes in his ears
yes the idea man
whatre his hopes and dreams his desires and aspirations
does he think all the time or does he set aside a certain portion of the day
how tall is he and whats his shoe size
where does he sleep and what does he eat for breakfast
does he put jam on his toast or doesnt he put jam on his toast and if not why not and since when
he thrust his face into that of the reporter
ahh youre useless
yes idea man
star reporter amy archer attractive smartly dressed
i tell ya the guys a phony
as a three dollar bill
why is he an idea man because hudsucker says he is
whatre his ideas
why wont they let anyone interview him
one reporter is leaning into another to keep his voice low five bucks says she mentions her pulitzer
as she picks up the morning paper and just take a look at the mug on this guy the jutting eyebrows the simian forehead the idiotic grin
why he has a face only a mother could love whack
the editor has slammed down the cigar box lid again but amy smiling raises a cigar into frame having beaten him
she tosses it to the reporter who failed to get one
the only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you al
yeah well monkey or not im still editor of this rag
amy i thought you were doing that piece on the f
edgar hoover when will he marry
i filed it yesterday
well do a follow up hoover hero or mamas boy
the rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that idea man story
all right chief
well do our best chief
ill give it a shot chief
at the door al hes the bunk
one of the wagering reporters grins at the other who is taking out a five dollar bill
the door bursts open and amy sticks her head in
ill stake my pulitzer on it
sweeping open to reveal the leering face of buzz the elevator gnat
whered ya get the new duds
norville is entering the elevator in his new executive outfit
and say buddy
howd old bucketbutt like his blue letter
na ha ha ha ha
did he bust a gut
did he die
did he well hello mr
buzz is instant decorum as mussburger enters the elevator
howre you this fine morning sir
norville has been worriedly patting at his pockets since the mention of the blue letter
that reminds me mr
i never did give you that to buzz lobby
we havent got all day
right away mr
as he talks mussburger pats at his suit pocket takes out a cigar inspects it
well im starved
i understand itll be quite an affair this afternoon and the executive roast tom turkey at the bohemian grove redefines the word superb
he puts the cigar in his mouth and buzzs hand is right there with a lighter
my pleasure sir
roast tom turkey
gee im hungry too sure sure
the elevator doors open
its been a pleasure serving you mr
buzz turns to norville
he is puzzled but trying to hide it and its been a pleasure serving you too uh
is already striding through the lobby norville has to lope to catch up
muss uh sid
shouldnt we be a little bit concerned with the downward spiral of our stock these last few days
i mean youre the expert but at the muncie college of business administration they told us mussburger gives an artificially hearty laugh and claps norville on the shoulder
its only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover
like i said youre the expert but norville is still loping behind mussburger trying to keep up with his long strides
you dont happen to remember the plan i outlined to you the day i set fire to your off uh the day i was promoted
i do remember and i was impressed
anyway thats all forgotten now
thank you sid but the reason i mention it is it would require such a small capital investment again youre the expert here damnit wheres my car
but theres such an enormous potential profit wise given the demographics baby boom discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class a black limousine pulls up to the curb
so if you think its appropriate id like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch mussburger is getting into the back seat sure sure tell whoever you
and to norvilles surprise slamming the door shut behind him
and id like to hear more about it at some point too
screeeech the car pulls away
norville is left talking to himself on the empty sidewalk
but sid i thought you and i were
say bud could you keep the sidewalk clear here
but im the president of this aww forget it
a cheap coffee shop a half flight down from the street
we are looking across an elbow of the coffee shop counter
in the middle b
norville sits dejectedly stirring a cup of coffee
behind him through the window wells we see the back and forth feet of pedestrians bustling by on the sidewalk
in the extreme f
sit two steaming mugs of coffee
they belong to two veterans of the coffee shop who from o
narrate the scene
i got gas bennie
yeah tell me about it
no kiddin bennie
i got gas
ya get the special
fah from it
he gives a low whistle under his breath as a woman enters from the street and hesitates by the door looking around
still attractive but looking somewhat down at the heels it is amy archer
enter the dame
theres one in every story
ten bucks says shes looking for a handout
twenty bucks says not here she dont find one
shes looking for her mark
the womans eyes settle on norville and she heads for the empty stool next to his
she finds him
she sits down
the woman says something to the counter waitress who exits
and awduhs a light lunch
she looks in her purse
she is holding her wallet upside down
the mark notices
norville however is not noticing he is staring intently at his coffee spoon his hat pushed back on his head his other hand propping up a cheekbone the womans presence
does not seem to have registered yet
hes not noticing benny
maybe hes wise
he dont look wise
plan two here come the waterworks
the woman starts crying
as the woman cries she accidentally on purpose jostles norville and he finally does indeed notice
the woman mouths words at norville who reacts sympathetically and waves his hands at the waitress
she explains her perdicament and
in unison entuh the light lunch
the waitress is entering to set a plate in front of the woman
the woman continues to talk to norville smiling wanly at him
shes got other problems of course
her mother needs an operation
no bennie lumbago
veteran s enunciation of lumbago falls into perfect sync with the womans moving lips
norville is listening sympathetically but he suddenly notices his watch
alarmed shes losing him bennie
norville is rising to his feet
maybe hes wise
he dont look wise
as norville turns to leave how does she pull this out
she puts the back of her hand dramatically to her forehead
disbelieving she isnt
thrilled she is
and indeed she does faint dead away falling backwards on the stool so that norville has no choice but to catch her
norville holds her awkwardly looking around for help
shes good bennie
shes damn good lou
a waitress enters extreme f
to block our view of the swooned woman and the embarrassed norville
the waitress is facing the camera and the two o
veterans the cropping gives us only her torso and the steaming pot of coffee she holds
bored nasal voice can i get you boys anything else
back of the waitresss torso in f
on either side beyond her the two veterans are looking up at her o
they sport extremely bored expressions topped by cabbie caps
looking at its frosted glass door the sign painter is just finishing lettering in norville barnes president
the sign painter makes way as we see norvilles shadow approaching even from inside the room we can hear that he is wheezing heavily
he is apparently carrying the girl cradled in his arms
he tries to reach down to get the doorknob cant manage it turns to press his back against the door and get the knob with his other hand
the door opens as norville swings around to enter
he is wheezing like a gas pipe about to explode
he swings around to kick the door shut
we see that the lettering on the door is now terribly smudged we also see in wet ink on the seat of norvilles pants senrab ellivron tnediserp
weakly still cradled in norvilles arms im sorry we had to take the stairs
it was just that horrible little elevator boy
not at all
youre light as a feather
pointing languorously the couch please
still wheezing horribly norville staggers over to the couch and deposits her gently on it
he straightens up and looks at her
she is smiling wanly at the camera
the entire image pulsates as the blood pounds behind norvilles eyeballs
we hear the loud rasping of his breath resonating inside his head
amy is talking but her voice is barely audible as if coming from a long way away
just a minute
he perches drunkenly on the edge of the couch and puts his head between his knees still fighting for breath
i dont know what came over me
i suppose it was the shock of eating after so long without the enzymes kicking in after so long or whatever
but then you couldnt possibly know what it is to be tired and hungry
speaking into his knees as he wheezes hungry anyway
i dont want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life its not a happy story
norville rises and starts putting throw pillows behind her head
suffice it to say that im jobless though not for want of trying that im friendless with no one to thank you take care of me and that had you
not come along at just exactly the moment that you did she screams staring down at the couch
norville jumps startled then looks where she is looking
on the white sofa cushion where he had been sitting is printed in wet ink right side around norville barnes president
norville i didnt know you were president here
norville stares dumbfounded at the sofa cushion
when the nickel finally drops he spins around to try to look at the seat of his pants
distracted but still modest oh its nothing really
just determination and hard work
he unbuckles his trousers
of course when i started in the mailroom last tuesday i thought it might take more time buzz enters holding a brown paper bag
say buddy heres the whiskey you asked f he freezes taking in the scene amy reclining on the couch norville standing in front of her with his pants around his
ankles still breathing heavily the bottle of whiskey in his own hand
flustered thank you buzz just leave it on the desk
leering happy days buddy
as he turns to leave and ill tell your secretary youre not to be disturbed
he snaps the elastic strap under his chin
after the doors shut behind buzz shuddering what a horrible little person
oh buzz is pretty harmless really at any rate i arrived in town not ten days ago full of dreams and aspirations anxious to make my way in the world
norville pours a glass of whiskey and brings it over to her
a little naive perhaps but thank you armed with determination a solid work ethic and an indomitable belief in the future i myself he crosses back to the desk
only to have that belief that unsullied optimism dashed against the marble and mortar of the modern work place norville takes a cigarette from a large wood cigarette box on
the desk and sticks it in his mouth
no thank you
seek and ye shall find work and ye shall prosper these were the watch words of my education the ethics of my tender years he has been pushing the box
the box tilts lazily forward and then disappears over the far lip of the desk
we hear the thud of the box landing amid the pitter patter of cigarettes raining onto the carpet
amys brow crinkles
continuing these were the values that were instilled in me while i was growing up in a little town youve probably never heard of mind if i join you
he is pouring himself a drink
be my guest
a little town youve probably he tosses back his drink gags looks at amy with his eyes bulging
once again her image pulsates
there is a roaring sound and an airy steam whistle as she silently moves her lips
he waves his arms and talks with a thick rasp as he staggers to his feet
excuse me i executive washroom
he staggers out a side door
on his exit amy leaps to her feet and scurries over to his desk
at the top of her voice are you all right
she throws open the top desk drawer
inside two lonely lead pencils roll through the otherwise empty drawer
amy expertly flips a cigarette into her mouth and strikes a match off the desktop
is it your lunch
the chicken a la king
from the washroom no i amy throws open another drawer empty except for an appointment book
as she hurriedly flips through page after blank page an arctic wind whistles emptiness
one page only has a notation
address wilkie grammar school junior achievers club
is the a la king repeating on you
amy shoves the appointment book back into the drawer
im fine i
you were saying
she mutters values
uh tender years
aloud a little town youve probably never heard of
she hastily stubs out her cigarette and waves her hand to disperse the smoke
she scurries back across the room as we hear the faucet being turned off she re strikes her languid pose on the couch just as the washroom door opens
norville gapes one hand pressing a dripping rag to his forehead
youre from muncie
why yes do you know it
norville starts making pumping motions with his fists and loud syncopated grunting noises
amy gapes at him
he starts singing off key fight on fight on dear old muncie fight on hoist the gold and blue youll be tattered torn and hurtin once the munce is done
amy lamely fakes singing along coming in louder on the last obvious rhyme
norville jumps an octave on it she quickly follows sit also pumping her fists
as norville crosses his hands and locks thumbs in front of his nose to make bird wings of his extended fingers goooooooo eagles
amy awkwardly imitates
norville excitedly sits behind his desk
a muncie girl
talk about the cats pyjamas
tell you what amy
im gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the hud
oh no really i dont bother to thank me its the easiest thing in the world
matter of fact i know where a vacancy just came up
he hits the intercom
to amy thisll only take a moment
good afternoon to ya this is norville barnes barnes
where the hell have you been
and wheres my voucher
norville thumps at his pockets
well im not sure where i i need that voucher
i told you a week ago it was important
but look im president of the company now and i i dont care if youre president of the company
i need that voucher
the intercom goes dead
oh of all the foolish
listen do you take shorthand
are you familiar with the mimeograph machine
of course i went to the muncie uh secretarial polytechnic
norville excitedly smacks a fist into a palm
a muncie girl
can you beat that
well i just dont know how to thank you mr
as he reaches to shake its my pleasure
she reaches for his hand but norville snatches it away and winking at her hooks thumbs in front of his nose and makes wings of his fingers
likewise hooks her thumbs in front of her nose makes wings and winking back gooooooooo eagles
but we pull back to reveal that the girl is now in a newspaper office demonstrating the fight sign to smitty a reporter wearing a fedora with a bent back
smitty howls with laughter
wheezing once the munce
amy sits down behind a typewriter and as she starts typing at words per minute and is this guy from chumpsville
i pulled the old mother routine adenoids
behind her an ancient man wearing an inksmans visor and sleeve garters toils over a large checkerboarded surface over which he shuffles letter blocks and black spaces
smitty gives a low whistle
that gags got whiskers on it
the phone rings and smitty reaches for it
im telling you smitty the board of hudsucker is up to something into phone yeah
say amy whats a six letter word for an affliction of the hypothalmus
without a break in her typing and its a cinch goiter its a cinch this guy isnt in on it
how much time to make the late final
smitty holds the phone away from his ear
still typing amy whistles and nods to her shoulder
smitty tucks the phone into it as she continues typing
hiya chief just the person i wanted to apologize to
smitty is looking at his watch
about seven minutes
still typing yeah i was all wet about your idea man
well thanks for being so generous
it is human and you are divine
no hes no faker
hes the real mccoy beware of imitations genuine article the guy is a real moron to the ancient puzzler as in a five letter word for imbecile back into phone
as pure a specimen as ive ever run across

heck if working at the argus doesnt make me an expert then my name isnt amy archer and ive never won the pulitzer prize
her eyes narrow

she slams down the phone

smitty bursts out laughing
better off falling for a rattlesnake
as she continues to type im tellin ya this guys just the patsy and im gonna find out what for
theres a real story smitty some kind of plot a setup a cabal a oh and say did i tell ya
he didnt offer you money
lets grab a highball
on norville barnes
she rips the page out of the typewriter swivels in her chair to face camera as we track in close and she hollers copy
rolling churning out great quantities of newsprint
papers piling up one on top of the other very many very quickly
throwing a baled stack of papers off the back of his truck
rolling into the f
a hand enters frame to snip its wires and wipe off the top paper
wearing an apron and a little paper boy cap mouthing extra
as he holds one of the papers aloft
pan up his arm to the newspaper and beyond it the towering hudsucker building
all of the above spinning towards the camera and stopping full frame
its headline over a picture of norville smiling is imbecile heads hudsucker
the subheadline not a brain in his head
is angrily slammed down to reveal that norville has been reading the inside
his face twisting with fury he leans forward and hits the intercom
miss smith can you come in please to take a letter
muttering to himself of all the cockamamie
amy is bustling in holding a steno pad and a pencil
as she seats herself in front of his desk he rises to pace behind it
did you happen to see the front page of todays manhattan argus
didnt bother to read the article
i didnt think the picture did you justice
the picture was fine
its what that knuckle headed dame wrote underneath
of all the irresponsible
amy take this down dear miss archer
i call you miss because you seem to have missed the boat completely on this one
how on earth would you know whether im an imbecile when you dont even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man
no change guts to courage
no make it common decency
these wild speculations about my intelligence or lack thereof
nodding these preposterous inventions would be better suited to the pages of amazing tales magazine
if the editors of the manhattan argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter
but i doubt it
i most seriously doubt it
as i doubt also that you could find a home at amazing tales a periodical which i have enjoyed for many years
yours sincerely et cetera
he drifts into thought
is that all mr
well you know me amy at least better than that that dame does
do you think im an imbecile
im sure i go on tell the truth i trust you and i put a lot of stock in your opinion
well i oh sure youre biased youre a fellow muncian
but would an imbecile come up with this
he whips the cover sheet off a display pad resting on an easel to reveal a large piece of graph paper with a circle rendered onto it
amy looks puzzled from the circle to norvilles proudly beaming face
i designed it myself and this is just the sweet baby that can put hudsucker right back on top
amy is bewildered
norville explains you know
why dont i just type this up
aww naw amy that wont be necessary
i shouldnt send it shes just doing her job i guess
well i dont know maybe she does deserve it
maybe she shouldve come in to face you man to man
well she probably had a deadline
sure but she could still have gotten your side for the record
well its done now whats the use of grousing about it
forget the letter amy i just had to blow off some steam
she gets up to leave and is heading for the door when norville adds shes probably just a little confused
amy turns at the door
yeah you know probably one of these fast talking career gals thinks shes one of the boys
probably is one of the boys if you know what i mean
through clenched teeth im quite sure i dont know what you mean
yeah you know
suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays
seems pretty obvious doesnt it
shes probably very unattractive and bitter about it
oh is that it
yeah you know
probably dresses in mens clothing swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named biff or smoocher or
and i bet shes ugly
otherwise why wouldnt they print her picture next to her byline
maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance
i bet thats exactly what she tells herself
but you and i both know shes just a dried up bitter old maid
say how about you and i grab a little dinner and a show after work
i was thinking maybe the king and i whap
amy slaps him
how about oklahoma
as she stalks out of the office norville barnes you dont know a thing about that woman
you dont know who she really is
and only a numbskull thinks he knows things about things he knows nothing about
he stares rubbing his cheek
say what gives
reading five oclock
rising from their desks collecting personal effects putting on their hats and coats
busy hands punch out
of the executive floor
a security man walks down the hall whistling swinging a ring of keys
after he passes the door to the ladies room it opens amy peeks out emerges goes into norvilles office
she goes to the desk takes out the appointment book flips through it
still empty except for the one date with the wilkie grammer school junior achievers club which now has a red line drawn across it with the notation canceled
looks around the office notices something
set into the wall to one side it is topped by a small plaque amy tries the knob which turns and enters
it is big and dim several stories high with spiral staircases reaching into and catwalks criss crossing the gloom above
it is filled with contraptions works cogs gears
there is no window but on what would be the window wall there is an enormous iron ring with a metal rod sweeping an interior circle
it is the backside of the great hudsucker clock
amy gazes about
she crosses to a door opposite the one she entered from
she stoops to peek through its keyhole
we are looking into sidney j
mussburger sits at his desk barking into a dictaphone
click click click the perpetual motion balls on his desk are going full tilt thrummmmmmm the clocks exterior second hand sweeps a shadow across the office
mussburger it seems never sleeps
from the desk of sidney j
executive order number slash a
to director of the jacksonville facility
copies to legal affairs business affairs central files
re movement of raw materials from the huron facility
due to unfavorable news in the slag markets jacksonville inventory must be reduced by percent with overflow diverted to the waukegan stamping facility
from the desk of sidney j
executive order number slash a
to director of watchoo doin down they miss archuh
she straightens and turns
facing her is a very old black man in a janitors jumpsuit with hudsucker industries the future is now emblazoned across it
we might recognize his voice as that of the narrator who opened the movie
who are you
how did you know who i am
ah guess ole moses knows jes about everthing leastways if it concerns hudsuckuh
but who are you what dyou do here
ah keeps the ol circle turning this ol clock needs plenty o care
time is money miss archuh and money it drives that ol global economy and keeps big daddy earth a spinnin on roun
ya see without that capital fomation yeah yeah
say you wont tell anyone about me will you
i dont tell no one nothin lessen they ask
thatches aint ole moses way
so if you know everything about hudsucker tell me why the board decided to make norville barnes president
well that even surprised ole moses at fust
i didnt think the board was that smart
but then i figured it out they did it cause they figured young norville for an imbecile
like some othuh people ah know
why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president
cause theys little pigglies
theys tryin to inspire panic make that stock git cheap sos they can snitch it all up fo themselves
but norville hes got some tricks up his sleeve he does
he draws a circle with his finger in the air
you know fo kids
yeah hes a smart one that norville heh heh hes a caution
wal some folks is square an some is hip to punctuate he gives a little jerk of his hips
but i guess you dont really know him any better than that board does do ya miss archuh
well maybe i an only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things bout things she uh when she dont uh howd that go
bristling its hardly the same why you dont even know yown self you aint exactly the genuine article are you miss archuh
well in connection with my job sometimes i have to go undercover as it were i dont mean that
why you pretendin to be such a hard ol sourpuss
aint never gonna make you happy
never made warin happy
uncomfortably im happy enough
chuckles okay miss archuh
turns and walks away i got gears to see to
calls after him im plenty happy
she is answered only by whirring machinery
elsewhere in the great room he is hunkered down next to a catchment which he buffs with a greasy rag
amys voice echoes hello
muttering to himself them po young folks
looks like norvilles in fo the same kind o heartache ol warin had
but then she never axed me bout dat
as ominous music swells we he slams down a typescript
i cant print this
why not its all true
the board is using this poor guy
theyre depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap
its pure speculation
why theyd have my butt in a satchel
chuckling ol satchel butt
i know theyre gonna buy that stock you dont know anything
fact is they havent bought it
the stock is cheap archer
whatre they waiting for
i dont know
amys hunches are usually pretty good chief
you dont accuse someone of stock manipulation on a hunch ignatz
the readers of the manhattan argus arent interested in sensationalism gossip and unsupported speculation
facts figures those are the tools of the newspaper trade
why its almost as if youre trying to take the heat off this barnes numbskull like youve gone all soft on him
come on chief thats a low blow
archers not gonna go goey for a corn fed idiot
all right i was out of line
but youre out of line with this stock swindle story
gimme some more of that moron from sheboygan stuff muncie
thats what sells newspapers
ive got an even hotter story the sap from the city desk
watch it archer its about a dimwitted editor who easy amy
he gives her a companionable goose
lets grab a highball and calm down
she whirls and slaps him
back off smoocher
smitty rubs his cheek staring as she storms off
angry say what gives
mussburger president norville barnes and the board of hudsucker industries cordially invite you to the annual fancy dress hudsucker christmas gala music dancing refreshments dainties formal evening attire de rigeuer
the music over the invitation we wish you a merry christmas segues into the dance music of the hudsucker chamber orchestra
fill the screen we glide among them and finally come to follow one couple norville and mrs
mussburger a large middle aged woman of the margaret dumont mold in an elaborately flowered and old fashioned evening gown low cut in spite of her overly heavy figure
she wears a large flowered hat with a rolled up veil
so wed gone out to the hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins
that must have been quite a disappointment mrs
i was in bed for a week
positively sick with fury
i called in the gardener and said monsieur gonzalez either those azaleas come up next spring or you are terminee
she throws her head back and roars with laughter
as the large woman leans back to laugh her feet stay planted on the ground and norvilles rise to be dragged with his toes scraping the floor through the continuing
im brushing up on my french with the most charming man pierre of fifth avenue
do you know him
i havent had sidney and i are planning a trip to paris and points continental arent we dear
mussburger has entered frame
im going to borrow norville for a while if you dont mind dear
mixing down as they leave her well frankly i
you have a charming wife mr
muss uh sid
so they tell me
norville let me shepherd you through some of the introductions here
try not to talk too much some of our biggest stockholders are uh scratch that say whatever you want
as amy enters in a simple yet stunning evening gown
she looks around the room then starts across the crowded floor towards the punch bowl
as mussburger introduces him to a tall imposing businessman in a tuxedo and a ten gallon hat
norville barnes allow me to introduce mr
zebulon cardozo one of hudsucker industries largest and most loyal stockholders
ignoring norvilles proffered hand dammit boy whats this i hear about you bein an embecile
what the hell is ailin ya
a week ago my stock was worth twice what it is now
im considering dumping the whole shootin match unless i see some vast improvement
dammit boy its a range war
either you pull our wagons into a circle or im pullin out of the wagon train
norville gives him a forced but hearty laugh of reassurance
no need for concern sir its only natural in a period of transition for the more timid element to run for cover so im yella am i
he starts peeling off his tuxedo jacket well see whos yella
his wife a small wiry woman steps in as mussburger starts dragging norville away
zebulon you mind now and quit bein sech an ole grizzly
as he reluctantly starts shrugging back into the jacket aww i wasnt gonna hurt the boy lorelei
as they make their way through the room norville is mopping at his brow with a handkerchief
im sorry sid i thought maybe if i showed him the long view we might thump
dabbing at his brow norville has walked square into the back of a debonaire man holding a martini
the drink sloshes and the man turns testily to face him
norville this is thorstensen finlandsen who heads a radical splinter group of disgruntled investors
norville nervously pumps findlandsens hand
finlandsen so sorry to meet you uh happy to walk into y uh pleased to make your findlandsen raises his hand to look quizzically at norvilles handkerchief which he now
holds himself apparently having been given it during the handshake
he hands it back to norville
thank you sir
he stuffs it nervously into his outside breast pocket as findlandsen stares at him
mussburger stands watching in the executive at ease hands dug into his pockets
i understand your concern about the down ward you know but i think youll find under our strong new leadership
as norvilles hand drops from his breast pocket the handkerchief perhaps caught on his sleeve whips out of the pocket and follows his hand down
findlandsen looks down and norville follows his look and stoops below frame to retrieve the hanky
findlandsen leans quizzically forward and peers down at norville who continues o
we anticipate in short order an upward
in rapid fire norville straightens up into crunch findlandsen whose head snaps back eyes rolling a hand pressed to his nose drink sloshing norville one hand pressed to the back
of his own head and the other wildly waving his hanky for balance takes a staggering step forward onto the toe of an elegantly gowned mrs
there is a drum roll and as the lights dim grabs the large old fashioned microphone in front of the band and grins
ladies and gentlemen distinguished members of the hudsucker board
i give you the king of swing the rajah of romance the incredible the unforgettable mister vic
vic tenetta takes the microphone from the emcee who backs away applauding as tenetta starts to croon
he wears a white dinner jacket
his jet black hair sweeps out over his forehead in a roguishly pompadoured mat one forelock droops and bounces across his forehead
clustered in a dim corner of the room smoking cigars
in the b
brilliantly spotlit vic tenetta continues his song
as mussburger joins them hows it going mr
but not bad enough
it could be better it could be worse
the stocks got to drop another five points if we expect to get controlling interest
norville tells me hes got some hot idea
cant be good
then it cant be bad
couldnt be better if it couldnt be worse
where the party noise is distant tenettas song just we are on a full shot of the back of a man who stands facing the twinkling cityscape but in an
odd leanedback posture with one hand reaching up to his hidden face his other hand pressed against the small of his back like a man with a stiff neck tossing back a drink
amy having just emerged onto the terrace squints at him
he turns and we see that it is indeed norville holding a dripping icepack against one eye
nothing really just
the more timid investors are no longer running for cover
let me look
sid found me the icepack
let me hold it or youll have a real shiner
people seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story
oh it isnt your fault amy
youre the one person whos been standing by me through all this
as she rolls the pack gently across his eye norville
theres something i have to tell you
you see im not really a secretary
i know that amy
i understand that youre not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts
im not that skilled as president
oh sure i put up a big front massages his eye not that everyones buying it
i believe in you norville at least i believe in your
intentions oh i dont blame them really
i guess i have sort of made a mess of things
these folks have to protect their investment
most of them are very nice people norville you cant trust people here like you did in muncie
they gaze out at the city
certain people are didja ever go to the top of old man larsons feed tower and look out over the town
you know on farm route
yes i well no i i never really
theres a place i go now the cutest little place near my apartment in greenwich village
its called anns
its a beatnik bar
you dont say
yes you can get carrot juice or italian coffee and the people there well none of them quite fit in
youd love it why dont you come there with me theyre having a marathon poetry reading on new years eve
i go every year
puzzled every year
well this year if its good i plan to make it a tradition
uh my it certainly is beautiful she nods out at the city to avoid norvilles quizzical look
the people look like ants
well the hindus say and the beatniks also that in the next life some of us will come back as ants
some will be butterflies
others will be elephants or creatures of the sea
what a beautiful thought
what do you think you were in your previous life amy
oh i dont know
maybe i was just a fast talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys oh no amy pardon me for saying so but i find that very
norville there really is something i have to tell you that kind of person would come back as a wildebeest or a warthog
no i think it more likely that you were a gazelle with long graceful legs gamboling through the underbrush
perhaps we met once a chance encounter in a forest glade
i must have been an antelope or an ibex
what times we must have had foraging together for sustenance picking the grubs and burrs from one anothers coats
or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways
i wish it were that simple norville
i wish i was still a gazelle and you were an antelope or an ibex
well can i at least call you deer
ha ha ha ha ha
seriously amy the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call karma the great circle of life death and rebirth
morosely yeah i think ive heard of that
what goes around comes around
a great wheel that gives us each what we deserve
he slaps his fist into his palm
tomorrows my big presentation to the board
ive gotta show sidney and the guys that i deserve all their confidence
sadly oh norville kiss me once amy
kiss me once for luck
sure norville sure
she gives him a peck
they look at each other
she embraces him
they kiss again
norvilles eyes widen
crooning the end of his song
turn to the bandstand and applaud
in the midst of a passionate kiss
labeled executive conference room
a secretary is hanging up a sign that reads quiet please
board meeting in session
chest and up
his upper torso is swaying his shoulders rhythmically rolling as he talks
we hear a whoosh whoosh sound from o
so we have economy simplicity low production cost and the potential for mass appeal and all that spells out great profitability
holding a just lighted but forgotten cigar in one hand and a still burning match in the other
i had the boys down at r d throw together this prototype so that our discussion here could have some focus
staring mouths hanging open in arrested motion much like when waring hudsucker jumped out the window at the previous board meeting
and to give you gentlemen of the board a first hand look at just how exciting this gizmo is
we now see that he has accelerated the hula hoop around his waist to quite a good speed
its fun its healthy its good exercise kidsll just love it and we put a little sand inside to make the whole experience more pleasant
and the great part is we wont have to charge an arm and a leg
mussburgers forgotten match has burned down to his fingertips
with a wince he shakes it out
the board is staring
what is it
does it have rules
can more than one play
to what makes you think its a game
is it a game
will it break
it better break eventually
is there an object
are you supposed to make it fly off
does it come with batteries
could we charge extra for them
is it safe for toddlers
how can you tell when youre done
how do you make it stop
is that a girls model or a boys
can a parent assemble it
what if you get tired before its done
is there a larger model for the obese
can you do it around your neck
what is it
you know for kids
the board looks at mussburger
its just exactly what hudsucker needs at this juncture
sure sure a blind man could tell you that theres an enormous demand for this uh
he smiles weakly at norville
congratulations kid youve really outdone yourself
reinvented the wheel
im going to recommend to the board that we proceed immediately with this uh
with the uh
that the dingus be mass produced with all deliberate speed
of course as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours
im for it
as furiously busy music starts furiously printing out executive directive jl
a hand enters frame and rips the directive from the teletype then hurriedly rolls it into a cylinder and slips it into a cylindrical metal capsule
the capsule is popped into a pneumatic tube
somewhere in the labyrinthine substructure of the hudsucker building
we hear a missile furiously hurtling towards us inside the pipe and rocketing by
once again we hear the capsule approach and rocket past
as a siren blares
on a huge board that says hudsucker design department flashing red letters announce incoming directive
the pneumatic tube spout shoots out a cylinder and a hand eagerly picks it up and yanks it out of frame
a technician in white laboratory smock is reading the directive as several other white jacketed technicians crowd their heads around his shoulders also reading
all of their eye and head motions synchronize as they eagerly read devouring the document line by line
a large sheet of graph paper is whipped down on top of a drafting table
under the caption overhead angle is a perfect circle
under the caption horizontal is a horizontal line
under the caption vertical side angle is a vertical line
looking thoughtfully down at the rendering
the head technician is stroking his beard and nodding
as a hand enters frame and stamps the drawing approved
as we hear the cylinder rocketing by
lettered on the frosted glass is advertising department creative bullpen
in sharp silhouette on the frosted glass we can see the three admen working inside
two pace back and forth smoking cigarettes as they toss out ideas
the third sits slumped in front of a silhouette typewriter his head resting on one hand his other hand resting on a half empty bottle of whiskey
in the f
outside the frosted glass and so not in silhouette sits a bored secretary reading war and peace volume one
well call it the flying donut
the dancing dingus
the jerky circle
with the cylinder rocketing by
up on the wall of the accounting floor is an enormous reproduction of the design departments rendering of the hula hoop
over the poster is an enormous banner what will pan from the poster to a high angle shot of a floor full of accountants sitting at their rows and rows
of desks all are looking up at the wall poster as they operate their manual adding machines to the same beat
all accountants wear identical vests shirtsleeves garters visors and spectacles
the head accountant stands in front of the room overseeing their efforts
he wears a full three piece suit a visor and a pince nez
being dropped onto a desk
its cover reads summary of cost the book is opened and its pages filled with rows of numbers are flipped to the last page where we quickly pan down to
the bottom line unit cost
looking down at the book as the head accountant hovers over his shoulder waiting for his reaction
the executive grimly shakes his head
as the accountants hand enters frame to scratch in in front of the suggested retail of
a hand enters frame to stamp the bottom line approved
the secretary in the f
is now reading war and peace volume two
with a little jazz
drawing a circle in the air the daddy oh
the circle o gaiety
in asbestos suits throwing down their visors as they scurry and dive for cover behind banks of sandbags
a fierce explosion harshly illuminates the sandbags
as the explosion the workmen cautiously peek out over the sandbags then flip back their visors and rise to their feet
bouncing among the flaming debris of the explosion is a hula hoop still intact
the secretary in the f
is now reading anna karenina
the silhouetted ad men frustrated and hoarse are still at it
the hoop dee doo
the hudsucker hoop
the third ad man slouched motionless at the typewriter up until now finally raises his head
ya got somethin
ya got somethin
i got somethin
printed at the top hudsucker industries proudly presents pan down to reveal the hula hoop pan down to reveal an artists hand working in fast motion to render the hula
hoop logo a grinning healthy s boy with a spray of freckles one fist thrown forward the other behind as if doing an athletic frug a hula hoop spinning with action lines around his waist
in seconds the artist has completed the logo and now also in fast motion he writes the slogan on either side of the boy you know
as the page is ripped off the art pad being carried away in a continuous motion by an engineer who looks at it nodding
we see that we are now in an enormous plant area
the engineer grimy from his labors in this sweaty industrial realm reaches up to pull an enormous lever
grinding into motion
as it begins to spit hula hoops in massive numbers
the hoops are spit onto a long metal arm where they rest hanging
a bale of hula hoops is loaded into a hudsucker truck to complete its load
the truck door is slammed shut
is thrown up to reveal the display window of a shop just opening for the day
in the window is an enormous hula hoop display with various hoops strung up on wire in front of a large cardboard diorama you know
reflected in the display window we see crowds of people scurrying by indifferent to the display
inside the shop we see the proprietor by the cash register his chin propped glumly in his hands
norville sits anxiously awaiting the verdict of amy who sits hunched over the ticker tape machine studying the emerging tape
amy finally looks up at norville and sadly shakes her head
crowds still scurry indifferently by
the shopkeeper stands idly in his doorway smoking a cigarette
we track in on the cardboard display
the displayed price of
has been crossed out
underneath it inked in reduced
norville is nervously pacing
amy still studies the ticker tape
once again she is forced to shake her head sadly
is suddenly covered as the hand enters frame to slap on a sticker
the hand enters frame to slap on a new sticker
then in rapid fire succession
free with any purchase
where garbage and garbage cans sit waiting for collection hands appear at the back door of a shop hurling a clutch of hoops towards the trash heap
one errant hoop rolls towards the mouth of the alley
the mouth of the alley
the escaped hula hoop emerges and starts rolling down the street
it rolls across the street
cars violently brake to avoid it
it rounds a corner and rolls up to a little boy rolls in a circle around him and finally wobbles to the pavement
the little boy looks at it steps inside it raises it to his hips and starts hula hooping
somewhere a bell is ringing
where the bell is ringing the front doors fly open and hundreds of schoolchildren run out screaming heading home but all in a dense pack
the screaming pack of schoolchildren round a corner and stop short their screams abruptly halting
they are staring fascinated at the hula hooping youngster
the children are dumbfounded
it is a moment the likes of which they have never dreamed
once again running maniacal possessed
we dont know where they are running but we can guess
jam packed with screaming children grabbing hula hoops off the shelves
norville sits slumped behind his desk his head resting on the desktop utterly dejected
suddenly the ticker tape hums to life and starts spitting tape
amy looks at it with mounting excitement
finally she looks breathlessly up norville
norville lifts his head from the desktop
a piece of scrap paper is sticking to his cheek
dramatic fanfare music starts we hold on norvilles expectant face
the music builds
we we can see the tidbits of time logo as a solemn voiced announcer intones rockwell news presents
tidbits of time
world news in pictures we kid you not
picture dissolves to a pan up the hudsucker building
cut to candid film of norville getting out of a car noticing the camera grinning and waving as he walks and taking a pratfall
what began as the brainchild of this madison avenue whiz kid is now a craze sweeping the nation
the hula hoop product of hudsucker industries is a recreational device that some experts predict may eclipse the television as a means of entertainment
a television sits against a neutral b
a hula hoop rolls into frame and bumps the tv pushing it out of frame
this dancing dingus of delight this jerky circle of gaiety is proving to be the toy of choice of most american youngsters
did i say youngsters
heres mom taking a break from her household chores
a woman switches off her vacuum cleaner takes a hula hoop that is conveniently leaning against a nearby wall and starts hula hooping
and even dad is swinging into the act
in the office dad smoking a pipe is also hula hooping
and so the congratulations pour in for up and comer norville barnes inventor of the hoop including one very special call
in jerky cinema verite footage a woman is excitedly sticking her head in norvilles door
hes on the line
swish over to norville agog who picks up his phone and voice breaking hello
this is the president
a half wipe leaves a split screen with half of the screen remaining norville the other half becoming a still of ike standing in a tank turret pointing commandingly
under the photo voice of general dwight d
oh my god sir
i just wanted to congratulate you
im very proud of you norville
oh my god sir
eisenhower is very proud of you
the american people are very proud of you

facing a battery of reporters at a news conference
barnes howd ya come up with the idea for the hula hoop
norville is holding one hand up to shield his eyes from the unaccustomed light
amy stands next to him beaming
well it was no great idea really
a thing like this it takes a whole company to put it together and im just grateful for the opportunity mr
barnes did you have any idea thered be such a huge response
well frankly i dont think anybody expected this much hoopla he is surprised by a burst of laughter
hoopla on the hula hoop can we quote you on that mr
well sure i guess mr
barnes are you thinking of giving yourself a nice fat raise
ha ha ha ha
come on guys
flash bulb explosion effects a
a scientist with a van dyke beard wearing a laboratory smock is facing the camera
behind him we see other scientists studying a hoop that has been hooked up to a gyroscopic looking device that analyzes its various movements and properties
what scientific principle explains the mind bending motion of this whipping wheel of wonder
a title supered over the scientists chest identifies him as professor erwin schweide
ze dinkus is kvite zimple really
it operates on ze same principle zat keeps ze earth spinning round ze sun and zat keeps you from flying off ze earth into ze coldest reaches of outer space
vere you vood die like a miserable shvine
yes ze principle is ze same except for ze piece of grrrit zey put in to make ze whole experience more pleasant the mean laugh
norville behind his desk in long shot laughing as we begin to track in
there is something disconcerting about his laugh it is harder more businesslike colder than the dopey laugh that accompanied his elevation to the presidency
or perhaps it is only our imagination for while still some distance away from him flash bulb explosion effects a
newsmen follow norville as he walks through the lobby of the hudsucker building
barnes did the board consider you an idea man when they promoted you from the mail room
well i guess so i dont think they promoted me because they thought i was a jerk
barnes whats the next big idea for you and hudsucker industries
jeez i dont know
an idea like this sweet baby doesnt just come overnight
barnes are you although ill tell you one thing i certainly didnt expect all this hoopla
this tired old joke brings some polite laughter
norville is smiling as he enters the elevator
as its doors start to close leaving amy behind and you can quote me on that

yes its hula hula everywhere
from the cocktail parties of the park avenue smart set
a group of people in formal evening wear are sipping highballs and chatting as they keep hoops in motion round their waists
to sweethearts who want to be married in the swing of things
a young couple stands before the altar hula hooping
to our friend the negro in the heart of the dark continent
pan down from elephant to two natives hula hooping as they grin into the newsreel camera
the mean laugh
yes as we draw closer it seems clear that his laugh is colder than before

sitting in a barber chair face lathered up as reporters crowd in
barnes rumpus magazine has called you the most eligible bachelor of the year and the society pages have been linking you with high fashion model za za
would you care to comment
a burning cigar emerges from the lather around norvilles face
it waggles as he talks
theres no truth to the rumors were just dear friends
he looks to one side
isnt that right za za
every mans dream in a tarty sort of way
sexily gr r r r r r r oww
the newsmen react
barnes whither hudsucker
whither norville barnes
how do you respond to the charges that youre out of ideas
has norville barnes run dry
the barber is periodically pinching norvilles nose to shave under it as he alternately pinches and releases norvilles voice breaks from nasal to normal and back
not at all
why just this week i came up with several new sweet ideas
a larger model hula hoop for the portly
a battery option for the lazy and handicapped
a model with more sand for hard of hearing
im earning my keep
speaking of that mr
barnes do you expect to get a raise
well by anyones account ive saved hudsucker industries our stock is worth more than its ever been
so yes i expect to be compensated for that
the mean laugh

the pull back from a blubbering executive reveals that we are at a board meeting
all of the board members sit around the table except for mussburger who a towel around his waist is receiving a choppity chop massage on a padded table from a
muscular man in a bulging t shirt
pull yourself together addison
nobody told me
nobody told me
you sold all of our stock
we dumped the whole load
now quit showboating addison i had twenty thousand shares
id be a millionaire now
sure sure wed all be millionaires
theres no point in looking back
at the time stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market further depress the stock then wed buy it all back and more of course once it got cheap
its never been more valuable
and im ruined
he climbs up onto the board table
im getting off this merry go round
he runs down the length of the table and hurls himself toward the window and thwok
looking in as addison flattens against the f
glass his face squushing his outflung hands likewise
all stare in horror for a long silent beat
with the sound of a squeegee being drawn across glass addison still frozen slides down the window hits the floor and falls stiffly back like a fallen tree
mussburger sits up and sticks a cigar into his mouth
had it installed last week
all right so the kid caught a wave
so right now he and his dingus are on top
well this too shall pass
mussburger didnt raise her boy to go knockkneed at the first sign of adversity
i say we made this kid and we can break him
i say the higher he climbs the harder he drops
i say yes the kid has a future and in it i see shame dishonor ignominy and disgrace
sure sure the wheel turns the music plays and our spin aint over yet
a small chamber orchestra the musicians in tails sit playing eine kleine nachtmusik
norville eyes closed reclines in his desk chair one uniformed woman stooping in front of him manicuring his nails another behind massaging his temples
a tailor is pinning up his pant cuffs
a french sculptor wearing a white smock a beret and a goatee squints at norville and chisels at a block of marble with a stone chisel and hammer
a goon sits off to one side hat insolently atop his head reading the funny papers
at length norville stirs opens his eyes sits bolt upright batting away the hands of the manicurist and temple massager
the musicians playing dribbles away to silence
nobody move nobody breathe
all sit frozen
you could hear a pin drop
eyes narrowed he gazes off into space squinting for his idea
a straight pin is rolling across the top it drops off where the pin ping
he glares at the tailor
its gone now
the musicians resume playing
everyone else resumes work
the intercom buzzes and a female voice announces miss amy here to see you
norville leans forward to hit his intercom
is she in the book
the door bursts open and amy storms in
for petes sake norville
hello amy was it i thought she said mamie never mind about that
she shakes a piece of paper at norville
you know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing
well i wouldnt call them nincom theyre going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at hudsucker
why in new york alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work people with wives and children and families well yes were pruning away some of the dead wood
but if you mean you know about this
know about it
you think the board would do anything like this without my authorization
no this was my idea from the start
your i we have to be realistic amy
you know things have slowed down a little here at hudsucker youre awful kind to yourself norville barnes the fact is youve slowed down sitting up here like a sultan
not doing a lick of work
why you know its ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you havent come up with one since the hoop and the reasons plain to see
youve forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place it wasnt for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of would you get out
this was addressed to the chamber orchestra whose playing dribbles off
they look inquisitively at norville then rise to pack up their instruments and sheepishly leave the office
ive been watching you norville barnes even though youve been trying to avoid me now aim shutup
and dont think i havent noticed how youve changed
i used to think you were a swell guy well to be honest i thought you were an imbecile now aim shutup
but then i figured out you were a swell guy a little slow maybe but a swell guy
well maybe youre not so slow but youre not so swell either and it looks like youre an imbecile after now aim shutup
you havent talked to me for a week and now im going to say my piece
ive got a prediction for you norville barnes i predict that since youve decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad youre going to lose all the
good things that your good ideas brought you
youre going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a board that wouldnt give you the time of day if you
worked in a watch factory
the goon looks up from his funnies
huh huh huh
to the goon shutup
to norville exactly
dont you remember how you used to feel about the hoop
you told me you were gonna bring a smile to the hips of everyone in america regardless of race creed or color
finally thered be a thingamajig that would bring everyone together even if it kept em apart spacially you know for kids
your words norville not mine
i used to love norville barnes yes love him
when he was just a swell kid with hot ideas who was in over his head but now your head is too big to be in over
now amy consider this my resignation thwock she slaps him
the bodyguard is on his feet
crack amy kicks him hard in the shin
she strides to the door leaving norville rubbing his cheek and the goon hopping around on one leg
pull back shows it to be her identification in her hudsucker personnel file
a hand brings into frame another picture of her this one a newspaper clipping
she stands on a podium accepting an award standing behind her are middle aged identical triplets
the caption says amy archer of the manhattan argus receives pulitzer prize
we are in mussburgers office
mussburger is seated at his desk looking at the file picture and clipping the sign letterer scraper is leaning over his shoulder having just put them down
thank you aloysius
this may be useful
aloysious nods wordlessly and turns to leave
as we track in on the picture of amy we after a beat a woman enters against the unblemished white background dressed in a flowing white dance robe trailing a
long diaphanous veil
she performs a flowingly sensuous dance moderne the music is a sensuous saxophone solo with lasciviously bending blue notes
after the woman has been dancing for several beats norville enters dancing after her pursuing her
he is wearing a coatless suit his sleeves rolled up his thin tie loosened
the woman dances around him letting her diaphanous veil trail sinuously around his body
we hear an echoing voice buddy
sitting in his desk chair sheened with sweat eyes closed licking his lips
he opens his eyes and looks stuporously about
buzz is grinning down at him in his little pillbox elevator cap
looks like ya nodded off there buddy
say ya got a minute
norville clears his throat
is it important
i like to think so
its this little idea i been working on
he turns an easel to face the desk
ya see i dont intend to be an elevator boy forever
take a look at this sweet baby
the easel displays an oversized sheet of graph paper
onto it has been rendered a top view which is a perfect circle and a side view which is a vertical line
norville gazes stupidly at the circle
ya get it buddy
incredibly convenient isnt it
ya see he produces a tall glass of lemonade with a straw sitting in it
this is how it works its these little ridges on the side that give it its whammy
see ya dont have to drink like this anymore he holds his head over the glass to drink from the vertical straw
now you can drink like this he bends the straw to drink from it at the horizontal
i call it the buzz sucker get it buddy
why people are just dyin for a product like this and the great thing is we wont have to charge an arm and a norville who has been stewing finally
barks wait a minute
he grabs the lemonade glass looks at it sneering
why this is worthless
but buddy norville yanks the straw out and crumples it up
this is the most idiotic thing ive ever seen in my life
yeah but buddy nobody wants a hare brained product like this
ya see buzz it lacks the creative spark the unalloyed genius that made uh
he pauses to belch
say the hula hoop such a success
but buddy and what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time
ive got a company to run here but buddy you were i cant have every deadbeat on the hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves
geez im sorry buddy an example must be made
buzz looks over his shoulder turns back to norville
wuddya mean buddy
is that plain enough for you buster
buzzs jaw drops
his elastic chin strap snaps under the pressure
awwww buddy and dont call me buddy
out of here
buzz sinks to his knees weeping
he clutches pathetically at norvilles pants legs
aw please sir this job its all i got
i understand if ya dont like the buzz sucker
just lemme keep my job im prayin to ya
we dont crawl at hudsucker industries
get out of my office
leave your uniform in the locker room
buzz stumbles away still weeping
im sorry buddy
ha ha ha ha
as we track in on norville laughing there is a low unearthly rumble and his face seems to dissolve into we pull back from the flame of sid mussburgers oversized
lighter as he finishes lighting a cigar
he is sitting alone in the boardroom but its door swings open and norville enters wearing plaid knickers a little cap and a knit shirt that shows his waist starting
he has a full golf bag over his shoulder
sorry im late sid
that back nine at riverdale is really murder
sure sure its a tough course
well thanks for coming kid
i thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed it seems were having some security problems here at the hud
ya dont say
ordinarily i wouldnt bother you with it but this is embarrassing kid it seems to concern you directly
hows that sid
its not important in itself some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming youd stolen the idea for the uh the hoop dingus from him huh
he no i hes just maybe i was a little rough on the boy ya see i ah forget it kid ya dont have to explain to me
hes a little person
like i say ordinarily it would just be a nuisance
but it seems well there was a spy in the company
he is shoving a file towards norville who opens it
sure sure we tried to kill the story
but her newspaper wont play ball
looks like her storys coming out
we track down the length of the board room table toward norville who stares horrified at the file
see kid the problem the boardll have
you hired this woman
kept her on while she made a chump out of you
serious error of judgment
i mean business is war kid ya take no prisoners ya get no second chances
and a boner like this
im afraid when the board meets after new years your position
well it looks like youre finished
stick a fork in ya youre done
we lose mussburger from frame as we tighten further on norville mussburger continuing off im sorry kid
i understand this dolly who betrayed you she used to be a friend of yours
norville is slowly dragging the golf cap off his head
and this elevator dope used to be a friend too
norville stares perfectly still
well theyve got your throat pretty well slit
and when youre dead ya stay dead
ya dont believe me ask waring hudsucker
yeah looks like curtains
well condolences kid
norvilles image turns to we pull back to show that it is on the front page of the manhattan argus
the headline in screaming nine point type next to the picture of norville is the subhead idea man a fraud
next to the sub subhead is a picture of buzz in his elevator operators pillbox hat stole hoop idea from genius elevator jockey clarence buzz gunderson
you cant print that
he grins wolfishly
we are printing it
shes hittin the streets this evening and shes dynamite
but al its the bunk
norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day i met him
why buzz couldnt have invented it look at the man hes an imbecile
archer youre a broken record
fact is gunderson did design it apparently hes some kind of prodigy says who
youre not the only one with sources amy smith has a source on the hud board very senior very hushhush yeah and ill bet his initials are sidney j
youve lost it aim
youve gone soft by the looks of it soft on the dummy from dubuque muncie
its no dig on you archer but this story is hot and youre no longer on top of it
why its the scoop of the century the other papers wont have the gunderson dope til tomorrow the allemeinischer zeitung le figaro theyll be choking on our dust come mornin
youre fools both of you
its obvious theyre out to crucify norville
theyre trying to destroy him
gently amy take a break
youve worked hard on this story heck you broke it for us
but its passed you by and smith here has taken up the slack
she is near tears
you want slack ill give you slack
youre not putting me out to pasture al i quit
consider this my resignation she turns to smitty effective immediately
and swings but he catches her before contact holds her by the wrist and sneers soft
amy swings her free arm to thwack blindside his other cheek
in flickering black and white he is lying on a couch that has been brought into his office gazing listlessly at a bend straw being interviewed by someone o
the footage is rough taking a moment to find focus the sound is tinny
dell me vat is first zing droppensie head ven i menzhon ze vord
listlessly aww whats the difference
sitting in a darkened board room gazing off at a screen that sends flickering light onto his face
und ven i zpeak of authority
awww i dunno
eggzplain please ze zignifikanz of ze straw
a shadow is thrown across the screen as a figure steps into the beam
he throws the sharp silhouette of a strict freudian analyst van dyke beard pince nez with chain trailing down to his vest one thumb hooked into the vest the other
hand holding a cigar wreathing smoke which he waves for emphasis
patient dizplayed liztlessness apathy gloomy indifference und vas blue und mopey
the image on screen cuts to four inkblots
the analyst sweeps in a pointer and thwoks each image as he comments on it
ven asked vut four rhorschach stains reprezented patient replied nussink much i dont know chust a blotch und sure beats me
the image onscreen cuts to a close shot of norville on the couch mouth listlessly agape
patient shows no ambition no get up und go no vim
he is riding ze grand loopen ze loop image cuts to a sine wave on a graph the top of which is labeled euphoria the bottom of which is labeled
despair and a reference line through the middle labeled normal
there is an x on the declining side of the wave near but not yet at the bottom which is labeled patient

casually puffing on a cigar
patient is eine manic depressive paranoid type b mit acute schizoid tendencies
so patient is
he interrogatively twirls a finger round his temple
the board murmurs
maintenance in eine zecure wazility
as he scores each point it is illustrated on the screen behind him a patient is forced into a straitjacket by two brawny unshaven attendants electricity arcs between two leads
on a wire cap being wielded by a technician and lastly a steel barred door is slammed shut behind a stooped and broken patient who is led shuffling away
here the film runs out chattering and the screen goes white
the projector is shut off and the lights go on
the board politely applauds
he has a vandyke beard and wears a cut off sweatshirt and dungarees and dark glasses and has the phone wedged into his shoulder as he tears open a large
yeah just get down here he says hes a friend of yours
he wont say but man is he from squaresville
he hangs up and we hinge with him to bring the length of the bar into view
norville dishevelled is on the other side bellowing
i want a martini
its new years eve and i want a martini
daddy its like i been tellin ya i thought you served misfits here
the barman is taking rolled up blow beepers out of the cardboard box and loading them into tumblers to set along the bar
yeah daddy thats a roger but we dont sell alcohol
what kind of bar is it if ya cant get a martini
its a juice and coffee bar man like i been tellin ya i want a martini
on this bar right now
ive had a martini in every bar on the way down here and im not about to martinis are for squares man
suddenly enraged whatd you call me
he starts awkwardly peeling off his suit coat
you son of a norville
he looks stupidly about the shoulders of his coat down around his elbows
he sees amy rushing up
oh its you
lookin for a nitwit to buy your lunch
oh norville i norvilles attention has already left her
he looks for the missing bartender
setm up fella
norville im sorry i
i tried to tell you
so many times
its hard to admit when youve been wrong
if you could just
find it in your heart to to give me another chance hey
wheres that martini

i know this last story was a lie
we can prove it

im all washed up
when youre dead ya stay dead
well that just about does it
ive seen norville barnes the young man in a big hurry and ive seen norville barnes the self important heel but ive never seen norville barnes the quitter and i
dont like it
she starts pumping her arms slowly chanting
fight on fight on dear old muncie
she steps back off the stool
norville watches her dully his head swaying
fight on hoist the gold and blue youll be tattered torn and hurtin once the munce is done with you
she looks hopefully for some effect but after staring at her for a slack jawed beat norville can only bring out you lied to me
i cant believe you lied to me
a muncie girl
he lurches off his stool toward the door
watching him despair fights with confusion on amys face
she realizes that though shattered he is still the simple innocent she loved oh norville
and bursts into tears
two loud revelers reel into frame one of them uncurling a blow beeper at the weeping amy
happy newby newby new
we dig you the most
as norville exits
it is night snowing
we pan with norville off the bar facade and ending the pan in the f
wipes up into frame
next to a picture of norville is the headline muncie mental case
the subhead hud chief to tend daisies
sub subhead headshrinker calls him walking time bomb
new years eve edition
norvilles hand enters frame to push the newspaper away and leave us looking up the empty street
norvilles back enters as he stumbles off alone up the street pulling up his coat collar as he recedes the newsies voice continuing ring out the old
ring in the new
voices well up echoing
a face looms with each voice hellishly lit superimposed over the walking norville youre not so slow but youre not so swell either and it looks like youre an imbecile
noooo i dont guess you will be here long
sure sure but even there they called you dipstick
and is this sap from chumpsville
imbecile after all
norville you let me down
you let mrs
you let the american people down
imbecile after all
i predict youre going to lose all the good things your ideas brought you
when youre dead ya stay dead
sure sure the kids screwy its official
this last voice and supered face is mussburgers
norville dissolves away to leave us on sidney in the hellishly bottom lit board members sit around the table conical new years hats on their heads
mussburger the only one not wearing a cap waves his cigar as he continues to talk the barred window boys are out looking for him now and well see how
wall street likes the news that the president of hudsucker industries is headed for the booby hatch
why when the doc gets through with him hell need diapers and a dribble cup
the board murmurs appreciatively
let me remind you that our secret post new years party will be held in the office of the president shortly after midnight tonight
remember its strictly stag so leave the wives at home well be showing some films and yes gentlemen there will be exotic dancers
one board member leers a trace of spittle at the corner of his mouth
well if thats all
with an unnatural rumble he straightens his papers and we
of the assembled around the table
long live the hud
norville trudges on faster sweatier
ring out the old
ring in the new
people come and go laughing talking blowing noisemakers making merry
ring out the old
ring in the new
ring out the thoomp
norville has run into someone
he looks up dazed
hey watch where youre say buddy
it is buzz the elevator boy dressed in an ill fitting tuxedo and a conical party hat
za za is on his arm towering over him leering at norville
buzz im sorry i buzz you gotta forgive me
i shouldnt a fired you i didnt know what i was doing
i was a little funny in the head i aw buddy i dont care about that
norville is stunned
nah thats all forgotten
muss uh sid said i could have the job back
absolutely buzz im glad he but he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me
but buzz say that was a swell idea
but buzz you know i never and sid says you stole it
but buzz well wuddya waiting for clarence pop him one
buzz swings and norville hits the snow hard
think about that idea man
norville groggily raises his head
say isnt he that lunatic
norville looks dopily up at the people in furs and party hats starting to gather
that big shot faker
the wall street fraud guy
nuttier than a fruitcake
they say hes a menace
wuddya waitin for call a cop
we hear sirens
norville staggers to his feet
the crowd cringes
hes on his feet
we can take him
norville bursts through the crowd running
buzz starts giving chase followed by the braver souls followed by the entire mob
runs gasping turning a corner
he went down here
behind norville the crowd rounds the corner led by buzz
a van is screeching to a halt and out jump two burly unshaven men in white one of them holding open a straitjacket the other carrying a large butterfly net
they join in the chase
norville turns down an alley
a drunk drooping off a lamppost gaily waves a bottle at him
ring out the old
ring in the new
the crowd is running past the mouth of the alley missing the turn off
norville gasping crashes down into frame his hands breaking his fall against the limestone
the camera spins ninety degrees to reveal that it is not floor but wall he has run into and is now leaning against
norville looks up sweating gasping
the massive hudsucker building looms dizzily up towards the stars capped by the huge hudsucker clock
ring out the old
ring in the new
norville staggers in
a gust of icy air that comes in with him flaps a dropcloth off a huge shape that dominates the lobby it is the heroic statue of norville that we
earlier saw him posing for
norville reels over to it stares dumbly
mutely mockingly dignified
he staggers off to the elevators
we are tracking across the office toward mussburger his feet up on his desk laughing demonically smoking his cigar
click click click click the perpetual motion balls swing on his desk thrummmmm the sweep second hand of the clock illuminated now casts a moving shadow that rolls across the
a piece of paper and a pencil lie on his desk as we approach we pan down and swing around to read it losing mussburger but still hearing his laughter
this last alternative has been circled in red
below it has been scribbled sidney j
we are tracking in toward the back of aloysius the sign painter who is stooped in front of the door
he looks back over his shoulder leering past the camera to reveal his work under president norvilles name has been scraped away and painted in is sidney j
he pushes past the sign painter
dark and empty
norville is peeling off his coat as he staggers over to the closet
we can hear distant revelry and the strains of auld lang norville has pulled his old mailroom apron from the closet and is putting it on hudsucker mail room the
future is now
norville looks at the door
through the glass we see the tail of the last r of mussburger being painted into place
norville throws open the window
he climbs out
norville back against the wall looks cautiously down
we hear distant chanting ten
a sickening drop
on the street far far below a lone cars headlights cut through the falling snow
we are floating in it is the shot with which the movie began
the sweep second hand of the hudsucker clock is approaching the of midnight the new year
in sync with the clock the chanting continues three
we have come in close on norville
a lone tear runs down his cheek
the toll is right at norvilles ear
startled he reaches up to press hands against his ears
distantly happy new year
he cant stand it
whimpering hands to his ears he edges his way back toward the window
the open window at a steep angle
someone inside slides it shut
no his gesticulation and a shuffle step upset his balance he trips falls catches the ledge no please
he is hanging onto the icy ledge by his fingertips
his feet dangle away
looking steeply up
its second hand is making its descent
falling turning lazily in the air and suddenly with a great moaning sound he stops suspended in mid air head down feet in the air
it is much like the freeze frame on waring hudsucker that the title of the film was supered over
he waves his arms to no effect looks around
frozen in attitudes of laughter celebration
snow sifts silently down around their motionless bodies
in his office frozen with an idiotic laugh pasted to his face
frozen one ball swung out but suspended hanging at the apex of its arc
outside the great arched window snow falls
he alone can move but doesnt fall
he looks awkwardly about his body in a dive bomber attitude canted steeply down
its sweep second hand is arrested on its downward sweep
whining noises emanate from within
the broom handle has been jammed between two cogs stopping them
we pull back along the handle to reveal moses who has thrust it there and who now turns back over his shoulder to address the camera
strictly speakin im never spozed to do this but
have you got a better idea
twisting back to look up over his shoulder there is a distant very distant singing
looking up the length of the hudsucker building
someone or something wrapped in white is flying toward us coming down from the stars
we can make out a male voice accompanied by strumming shell be comin around the mountain when she comes shell be comin around the mountain when she comes
for it is an angel arrives
he is a balding man wearing rimless glasses in a white robe large feathery wings sprouting from his back and beating heavily until he comes to rest in midair
he puts aside the harp he has been strumming on a nearby windowsill
love that tune
how ya doin kid
presenting himself he spreads his arms and stamps his forward foot forgetting that there is nothing beneath his foot to stamp
he lurches forward momentarily losing his balance
he rights himself
the halo spinning lazily over his head has been jarred askew
with a flick of his forefinger he rights it
how dya like this thing
theyre all wearin em upstairs now
he blows a dismissive raspberry
its a fad
he pats at his robe produces a white cigar
i hear youve been having uh
he casually flicks his thumb out of his fist lighting it
he lights the cigar off his thumb takes a puff
been having some problems with the board
the more things change know what iyayayeeeeee
pain reminds him that he has forgotten to extinguish his flaming thumb which he now waves frantically about
jesus christopher that smarts
where was i
oh yeah the board
i guess sidneys been puttin the screws to ya huh norman
well say what you like about the mans ethics hes a balls to the wall businessman
beat ya any way he can
straight for the jugular
any particular reason you didnt give him my blue letter
i mean jesus norman just a dying mans last words and wishes no big deal
oh geez mr
hudsucker i apologize there was an awful lot of excitement and i guess i mustve mislaid its sittin in your apron pocket right where you left it
norville reaches in and pulls out the wrinkled blue letter
failure to deliver a blue letter is grounds for dismissal
geez i ah its new years im not gonna add to your woes
im just saying
well why dont ya read it
yeah go ahead
might learn somethin
he tears open the envelope reads from the desk of waring hudsucker
by the time you read this i will have joined the organization upstairs an exciting new beginning
i will retain fond memories of the many years you and i yeah yeah its the standard resignation boilerplate go down to the second paragraph
many years uh
i know that you will be wondering why i have decided to move on ending my tenure at hudsucker and here on earth
you will be thinking why now when things are going so well
granted from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials sure sure were doing fine
these things have long since ceased to give me pleasure
i look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company
now i see only an empty shell whom others call a success
how has this come to pass
when and why did i trade all of my hopes dreams and aspirations for the emptiness of power and wealth
what the heck have i done
as norville reads hudsucker casually examines his fingernails then pats down a yawn
looking back now sid i see that i allowed time and age to corrupt my dreams
instead of fiercely guarding what was timeless inside of myself i let the hubbub of earthly commerce erode my character and dissolve my better self
how is it that some manage to preserve themselves where i have failed
sidney i do not know
perhaps if others love you you may more securely love yourself but i am alone
i loved a woman once sid as you well know a beautiful vibrant lady an angel who in her wisdom saw fit to choose you instead of i
norville is interrupted by loud blubbering
he looks up
hudsucker is weeping loudly into a white handkerchief
he saws at his nose gives it a loud honk and urgently quavers in a voice strangled with emotion skip this part
he waves his hankie in get on with it circles
last paragraph last paragraph
norville looks down the page
and so sid the future does not belong to such as i nor even you
we have made our compromises with time
the future belongs to the young who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption
accordingly in the spirit of hope and the ringing in of the new i hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company and my seat on the board to whomever
is hudsuckers most recent employee at the time of my demise
i know this will disappoint you you sid who have served so diligently and for so long
but tough titty toenails
he roars with laughter
thatll show the bastard
he merrily wipes his eyes
yeah go ahead
but sid let me urge you to work closely with the new president and to keep giving hudsucker industries all your energies but not your soul
for while we must strive for success we must not worship it
long live the hud
norville gives a musingly appreciative nod
pleased with himself yup
its all there
well see that it gets delivered in the morning
hudsucker picks up his lyre and heads back up toward the stars
mussburger still sits frozen in his chair
outside the great arched window hudsucker rises through the falling snow on his way back to the heavens
ridin six white horses shell be ridin six white horses shell be ridin six white horses when she comes
we hear a great wrenching sound from the gear room next door
moses pries the broom handle loose from the great gear
with a low moan the clockworks start to shudder and turn lurching forward swinging down as norville falls the last few feet and lands on his face with one last
mighty bong of the hudsucker clock
from a tavern sign that says anns down to the front door which norville is entering
sitting halfway down the bar is amy staring morosely into a coffee cup
at the cut we are tracking back pulling away from her
norville enters comes up next to her and makes the go eagles sign hooking his thumbs in front of his nose and spreading his fingers
two familiar voices narrate the scene sounding a little tipsy what the hecks he doin benny
amy looks at norville startled
after a moment she reciprocates the sign
what the hecks she doin lou
what the heck they doin
norville and amy embrace
you know what theyre doin now lou
this i know benny
this youre familia with
our pull back ends looking across an elbow of the bar towards norville and amy now in wide shot
resting on the bar in the extreme f
are two champagne glasses half full of fizzing champagne
norville and amy kiss
we hear labored raspy breathing
yall right benny
in a quavering voice yeah im
its beautiful lou
lou also is beginning to sound choked up it is beautiful benny
almost weeping as norville and amy continue their embrace its the most beautiful ting i ever saw
its the most beautiful ting i ever saw
a bartender enters to block our view of norville and amy
he is youngish with a beat goatee wearing dungarees and a sweatshirt with cut off sleeves
he looks to either side at benny and lou
you cats comin from a party
hacks new years gala
get you anything else
we see benny and lou are sitting side by side at the bar
lou wears a fake whispy beard and white eyebrows and a long flowing robe he holds a fake scythe
on the bar next to him sits a large hourglass
benny is wearing nothing but an oversized diaper a baby bonnett and a sash across his hairy chest and thick belly that says
he chucks himself in the heart cocks his head and sucks in air then blows it back out
lying on the boardroom table
as a hand enters to lay a wristwatch on the table next to it we hear the voice of moses the old maintenance man
and so began
the new year
the hand reenters to lay down a wallet and then to deposit a burning cigar in an ashtray
and the start of a new business cycle
when he learned that norville owned the compny ol sidney was upset at first
we tilt up to show that mussburger is walking toward the boardroom window
board members silently remonstrate with him as he tries to wrench it open
its a good thing doc bromfenbrenner was there
doctor bromfenbrenner stands to one side watching brow furrowed a pencil pressed to his lips
cause he was able to keep sidney from harmin his ol self
being slammed behind sidney who straight jacketed is puffing on a cigar as he is led away
now norville he went on an ruled with wisdom and compassion
norville is eagerly pointing at a design he has up on an easel under the heading brand new is a large circle
the side view is a flat line
and started dreamin up them excitin new ideas again
you know for kids
the board members look at the design puzzled
norville takes a drop cloth off of a piece of plastic on a pedestal
he has the boards complete attention
an thats the story of how norville barnes climbed away up to the forty fourth floor of the hudsucker buildin
he picks up the plastic disc and as he sails it we
as it floats out the boardroom window
an then fell all the way down but didnt quite squish hisself
we boom up away from the boardroom to the great hudsucker clock
ya know they say there was a man who jumped from the fortyfifth floor
but thats another story
heh heh heh
ya heh heh heh
we fade out on the clock as moses laughter grows distant and end music swells
