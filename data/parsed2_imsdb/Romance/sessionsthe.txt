formerly the surrogate written by ben lewin based on a true story subtitle berkeley california a busy intersection near the uc berkeley campus
a strange self propelled motorized gurney whirrs into view and makes its way over a pedestrian crosswalk
the passenger mark obrien in his early s is visible only from the neck up
the rest of him is covered by a blanket
he operates the gurney with a mouth control and a set of mirrors positioned around his head
mark obrien has been going to uc berkeley since
thats obrien in the motorized gurney heading for class last week
the gurney continues along a leafy promenade on the campus
passers by just go about their normal business
he had polio when he was years old
the disease left his body crippled but his mind remained sharp and alert and since he wanted to be a writer mark obrien entered cal to major in english and
learn his trade
we hear a voice reciting a verse of poetry as we follow mark in his contraption
graduation today i hear the crowds applause receive congratulations from my friends today i ask if ive found a place among the rest i hope you see a man upon
this stage who studied
wrote and passed the test in cap and gown diploma on my chair the scene changes to the interior of a large auditorium
a graduation ceremony is in progress
suddenly everyone in the hall graduates their families academics and others rise to their feet as mark in his gurney buzzes across the stage a mortar board hung on one
of the handles
and so mark obrien graduates from cal one of english majors to receive degrees today
the dean steps forward congratulates mark and places a diploma on his blanket
the gurney makes its way across the rest of the stage to thunderous applause
the scene changes back to the campus exterior
the news reporter talks to camera
if this report tells us anything it is that a disability is not necessarily a handicap
in the background marks family and friends are gathered round him in a jubilant mood
mark obrien teaches us that courage and perseverance overcome obstacles
with mark obrien at uc berkeley bill hillman channel five eyewitness news
classic shot of the illuminated golden gate bridge
it is about
all is quiet
we follow a mean looking alley cat to the front of a modest ground floor apartment
it pauses then slinks round the side onto a ledge and in through a partially opened window
the cat comes through the window hops onto the floor and quickly finds a nice little plate of food scraps that has been set out specially
as it settles down to its meal we become aware of a heavy and regular sound like a ships pump coming from somewhere close by
in the center of the room is an object that looks like a prop from a s sci fi movie
a human head protrudes from one end
the object is an iron lung and its purpose is to keep its occupant mark obrien breathing
seconds the pump mechanism creates a vacuum inside forcing marks chest to expand and suck in air
he is fast asleep
breathing look you this most excellent canopy the air presses down upon me at pounds per square inch a dense heavy blue glowing ocean
teasing me with its nearness and immensity
and all i get is a thin stream of it
a fingers width of the rope that ties me to life
having now eaten its fill the cat has a good scratch then wanders over to the iron lung
it hops up onto the small platform that supports marks head and slides itself along his face once this way once the other way then jumps on top of the
iron lung and walks its length
through the portholes we just make out the shape of marks bent undersize body
suddenly marks nose twitches
he opens his eyes and grimaces
his face continues to contort as he tries to cope with the terrible itching
he shakes his head violently then stops suddenly and closes his eyes
we hear his thoughts
okay just focus
now scratch with your mind okay your mind scratch with your mind
after a couple more nose twitches he settles down
it seems to have worked
in his peripheral vision mark can see the cat making itself comfortable in a corner chair one of the only other pieces of furniture in the room
the first hints of dawn start to appear through the curtains
they illuminate a large framed portrait of the virgin mary hanging on the wall
mark acknowledges it
sunlight streams in making the picture look truly sacred
joan a solid but slovenly woman in her late s walks up to marks front door takes a key from her purse and lets herself in
she comes in
mark does not immediately acknowledge her
the center of the iron lung basically a thin mattress has been slid out and joan is in the process of giving mark a bed bath
he is frail and helpless
there is a look of resentment in his eyes as this apparently unfeeling woman exercises total control over him at least temporarily
joan i swear this was one crazy bitch whod swing me about enough to scare me but careful enough so she could say now what was all the yelling about
you polios are screamers
i didnt say a word but typed my skinny novel in my head and thought about revenge
in the course of washing his private parts mark has an involuntary erection
joan gives him a shriveling look
he feels belittled and humiliated
mark is on his side his trousers are on and she is buttoning up a bright red shirt
it is an awkward business
they do it in silence avoiding eye contact as much as possible
joan pushes mark along in a gurney similar but slightly different from the one in the news clip
there are no mirrors and no motor just an oxygen tank a tube and a mouthpiece just next to marks mouth
most of him is covered with a colorful blanket
the whole thing is a sports coupe version of his iron lung
would you mind if i asked you a favor
you need help moving furniture
she has no apparent sense of humor
i need an advance on my pay like two weeks
thats not a big ask is it
mark looks rightfully shocked
what if you dont last another two weeks
he gives her a look and means it
we hear his thoughts
joan never failed to put me in a crappy mood
it was also a drag that i was no longer allowed to use my other gurney the self propelled one
it had caused a couple of spectacular accidents
they turn a corner and approach a church
basically in spite of all the mirrors i couldnt see where i was going
joan pushes marks gurney into the sanctuary
father brendan is giving a sermon
mark listens with satisfaction
there are not many others there
the apostle luke tells us that when elizabeth spoke to mary the baby in her womb leapt for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine
ears the babe leaped in my womb for joy
so marys fear and apprehension slowly gave way to pride and purpose
elizabeth saw the greatness in mary
blessed art thou among women
elizabeth pregnant herself with st
john felt the power of this wondrous woman
it was elizabeth and her absolute faith that gave mary the courage she was lacking and she gave thanks saying my soul doth magnify the lord and my spirit hath
rejoiced in god my saviour
may the spirit of the lord be amongst you and remain with you always
mass is over
people come up to mark and place a hand on his head or chest and say god bless you
in the background we can also hear father brendan
may the peace of the lord be with you
and also with you
mark waits alone in a tiny chapel off to the side of the church
he turns his head takes a suck on the mouthpiece of his portable respirator then looks around at the impressive stained glass windows
the expression on marks face is that of a true believer
im definitely a true believer
but i believe in a god with a sense of humor
a wicked sense of humor
one who created me in his own image
father brendan enters
there is an awkward short moment when he realizes that there is no point in offering to shake hands
for no good reason he nods instead
im father brendan
i dont think weve met
no we havent
im mark obrien
i knew father seamus very well
im sorry that hes not here any more
as are many others
im going to do my best to fill his shoes
i understand youd like me to hear your confession
yes i would
by the way i enjoyed mass
i liked your tone
father brendan is not sure how to take this
you dont believe absolute privacy is an essential part of the confessional do you
no i do not
i believe sincerity is the most essential part
i told my attendant to come back in half an hour
is that okay
yes take your time
im in no rush
did father seamus say anything to you about me
no one said anything to me about you
i can be a bit time consuming but im worth the trouble
father brendan breaks a smile for the first time
im here for you mark
look this is not exactly a confession
i havent yet done the deed
i was hoping to sort of get a quote in advance
father brendan sits down
tell me whats on your mind
the most immediate thing on my mind would be my attendant joan
im thinking of getting rid of her
its an evil thought but i cant help it
is she dishonest or incompetent
no neither of those
she looks at me the wrong way
its that you need me more than i need you look
id like to show her shes wrong just for the evil satisfaction it will give me
is that a sin father
well it obviously troubles you
yes it troubles me a lot
because maybe its really a power trip
me against her
me against the world
i really wouldnt worry too much about that
the question is whether you like having her around
i cant stand her
then get rid of her
if i were in a position to choose id get someone nice
even it was a power trip
then i have your blessing to fire her
thats good enough for me
please if ever you feel i can be useful do let me know
it was a pleasure talking with you
we see a pencil eraser on the end of a stick slowly tapping the keys on an electric typewriter
at the other end of the stick which is about a foot long is mark manipulating it adeptly with his mouth
there is a white index card in the typewriter on which he is typing a job notice
we see the first word
poet a community notice board
a young female hand reaches in and takes an index card off the board
the card reads we see amandas face as she smiles
she is in her early s
amanda would have been a pretty girl to touch to hold to kiss to take to bed
mark is in his iron lung
amanda sits in a stiff chair a few feet away being interviewed
rod is working in the kitchen
marks poem continues
her perfect pale skin her tudor court face her strong fleshy legs drove me into ecstasies of despair
mark asks a question
do you have any experience
no none at all
that sounds perfect
mark stares at her lovingly
from marks pov amanda slides him out of the iron lung
it is her first time and it is an awkward business
how long can you stay out
three or four hours
depends whether im having fun
it is some time later
amanda is giving mark a massage
with enormous satisfaction he feels her curvy parts moving around him and sometimes pressing against him
he also gets a birds eye view of her breasts
shed count in french before lifting me un deux trois quatre
id scream tugged by her athletic arms from the everlasting gravity
mark on a blanket is on an outing with amanda matt and another couple
they are playing scrabble
she took me on a picnic once with her boyfriend and another couple
lust crackled in the air between those twentyish people
amanda is clearly paying more attention to mark than to matt
what did the boyfriend think
that i was in his way
im always in somebodys way i thought the sun in my eyes
we sense marks deep satisfaction as he closes his eyes and the sun warms his face
as she glided through crowds of lives she couldnt leave me lying there dried out bubble gum stuck on the underneath of existence
amanda and her boyfriend matt are sharing the tub
do you touch him
i do everything
any other questions
you dont have to be so defensive
im not about to get jealous
hes a much nicer person than you are
she gets out of the bath suddenly
amanda is shaving mark
what does your boyfriend think of me
hes an asshole
it doesnt matter what he thinks of you
im interested in the opinion of an asshole
he thinks youre some kind of svengali and that youre going to hypnotise me into your cult
he says he can already see changes
she finishes shaving him and cleans him up
his eyes feast on every detail of her face
cut to somewhere at night amanda is giving mark a pole dancing demonstration complete with disco beat and mirror ball lighting
so with her gentle fearless heart she took me in
i thrived in her garden and wanted more
amanda wheels mark towards a clothing store
amanda is wheeling mark in his gurney around the store stopping from time to time to take something down from the shelf
she picks out a shirt
this you must have
as she leans over to show it to him mark doesnt seem to be listening
he whispers to her
i love you
she says nothing and gives the faintest of smiles then puts the shirt back
they continue round the store in thoughtful silence and avoid eye contact with each other
we sense from the looks on their faces that this moment spells the end of a beautiful friendship
mark and father brendan are huddled together in the little chapel
did she reciprocate your feelings
she didnt seem to
sometimes people can be very shy about their emotions
well in case she didnt get it the first time i told her again that i was in love with her and wanted to marry her thinking it might swing
they sit in silence for a while
father brendan seems to be at something of a loss
i wish i knew what to say
i mean welcome to the human race
every day someone breaks someone elses heart
and as i said im here for you
i just wish i had something more useful to offer
all i have are these vague ideas about life and death that priests are equipped with
have you ever thought of discussing your feelings with a therapist
not as yet
father i think i need a hug
after a moment of surprise father brendan rises to the occasion
he seems to know how to move mark gently and efficiently
rod is in the front yard picking up the newspaper
he sees vera chinese mid s a sensible type approaching marks front door
he offers his hand
i do four to twelve
vera sits in the same spot where amanda was interviewed but without the same aura although she is far from ugly
have you had any experience
she is reserved and unsmiling
mark seems disinterested in the whole process
the phone rings
they both look at it
would you get that please
vera picks up the phone and answers a little hesitantly
after a few moments she turns to mark
its sandy from pacific news service
could you press that button and put it on the speakerphone
she does as she is asked with perfect efficiency
hi mark how you doing
i have a new attendant
she answered the phone
her names vera
mark weve gotten sponsorships to do a series on sex and the disabled and wed like you to do some interviews in the berkeley area
could you do that
say in the next week or so
mark is momentarily taken aback
no particular reason
if youre working on something else then we can talk about it later
no now is fine
vera wheels mark towards his first interview
the more we see vera the more we like her
there was no denying it
a door had opened which i could not close and in invisible writing it said do not enter
we see the slowly rotating reels of a portable cassette recorder
we hear a female voice
some positions like that one are pretty much impossible
carmen early s is a paraplegic in a wheelchair
she is pretty and animated and has full use of her hands
i dont know if you can quite visualize it
its called a lateral or sideways reverse cow girl
it is obvious that mark cannot visualize it
although she doesnt give much away we sense that vera can
dont worry about it then
its just a question of depth of penetration
to some people its really important like my partner for example
its not such a big deal for me
i get just as excited when he licks my nipples if and when he bothers to do it
mark looks troubled
i think the tapes about to run out
at that very moment there is a click and the tape runs out
vera flips the tape over sets it running in record mode and takes her place again behind marks gurney
do you want to keep going
uh i think ive actually got enough to work on
get back to me if you need anything else
oh and let me give you gregs phone number
hes full of stuff you wouldnt think was possible
rod vacuums the floor while mark taps away on his typewriter
mark looks troubled
we hear voices
okay shall we start
we hear the cassette recorder click on
greg is a handsome quadriplegic
vera is there with mark
oral sex is a matter of taste
mark doesnt get it
vera as usual is impassive
and one thing that really works in my favor is that i smoke so much weed that my taste buds are pretty jaded
this gives me a great deal of stamina in the tongue department and stamina is key in cunnilingus
the alley cat creeps in through the open window
mark watches it approach from his iron lung
who are these people
i feel like an anthropologist interviewing a tribe of headhunters
the cat seems to understand
a lady with a crisp voice answers the phone
on the other end of the line mark tries to control the shakiness of his voice
uh may i please speak to someone in the center on sexuality and disability please
im sorry sir the center on sexuality and disability has been shut down
mark looks immensely relieved
he closes his eyes
im sorry to have bothered you
its no bother
sir before you go i can give you a phone number for one of the therapists who used to work there
would you like that
he winces under the strain of having to make a decision
sir are you there
it is a typical modern multi purpose office building
we hear the sounds of grunting bumping and clanging
there is something of a commotion going on at one of the elevators
vera and a small well meaning crowd are trying to get mark and his gurney inside
it will not fit horizontally
as they angle it up mark begins to panic
it wont fit
its not going to fit
lets go back
a muscular latino guy reassures him
hey its fine
we got you
this is going to work just fine
vera guides him
the top has to go over to the left
i dont feel so good about this
lets forget it
the latino guy takes no notice
vera is flushed and angry
look do you want to see this woman or not
one more heave and the gurney goes in with a jolt
well its too late
the elevator doors close
laura a well dressed attractive woman in her late s sits in a chair a few feet from mark
his gurney takes up most of the available space in the room
did you ever discuss sex with your parents
that would have been unthinkable
thats the way they saw the world
it wasnt just that polite people didnt think about sex
no one did
it was never discussed
as far as they were concerned there was nothing down there
she is pretty in a dark angular way
a phone on her desk rings
sorry about that
she walks over to it pushes a button then comes back
she has a noticeable limp
whats that from
youd hardly notice
its not easy the whole thing attracting a guy dating sex all very problematic
i find that hard to believe in your case
well you better believe it
so what sort of chance do you give me
of achieving your romantic fantasy
very small to minute
look theres no need to pull any punches
you can be as direct as you like with me
mark im just a humble sex therapist
i try to help people with sex problems that can be addressed
your problem i understand is that you have never had sex
would i be correct in assuming youre unable to masturbate
has anyone done it for you
have you ever asked anyone
i asked someone to marry me
does that come close to masturbation
you know being with the person you love is not the only way of expressing yourself sexually
there are people called sex surrogates
psychotherapists and psychiatrists are not allowed to have sex with their clients even if it seems like a good idea
sex surrogates dont have that limitation
would this be covered by my medical benefits
youd have to pay the full fee whatever that was
so basically i would be paying for sex
yes mark you would be paying for sex
but the person you would be paying is not a hooker
she is a highly trained and sensitive professional who is not motivated by money
just as im not
in fact you can think of a surrogate as an extension of me
do i seem like a hooker to you
mark comes back to reality
what sort of cost would i be looking at
it depends how many sessions you need
say one just to try it and see if i like it
im sorry it doesnt work that way
its a process
you have to be patient with yourself
there can be quite a lot of talking involved
ive set aside
do you think that would cover things
oh yes thats ample
so what do you think
rod wheels mark into the church
mark waits in the little side chapel
father brendan enters
hi good to see you
how are things
things are sort of confusing at the moment
i would appreciate your advice as a friend if you know what i mean
father brendan sits down on the end of a pew next to mark
sure and i understand what you mean
do you remember at one point you suggested i might see a therapist
well one way or another its a long story i ended up seeing a therapist a particular sort of therapist a sex therapist
my penis speaks to me father brendan
sometimes i ejaculate during a bed bath in front of my attendant
all i feel is shame and mortification while other men apparently get pleasure
im sorry if i sound angry
dont worry about it
mark pauses to take a few breaths on his oxygen mouthpiece then goes on
this therapist suggested i could work with a sexual specialist have sex with someone known as a sex surrogate who would be sensitive to my special needs
ive been giving it some thought
father brendan interrupts him
what do you mean have sex
well i dont really know how to describe
sorry that wasnt what
i mean are we talking about sexual intercourse
i think so
i did do my best on the question of marriage
father brendan shakes his head with concern
what is the difference between this sexual specialist and a common prostitute
i dont know but i think theres a difference
how do you know shes not some hooker gussied up as a social worker whos just going to rob you
i trust what my therapist said about her
how old are you
why exactly now
i never had any spare cash before
thats a major factor and im probably getting close to my use by date
and this is what you want my advice about
your advice as a friend
and do i have the casting vote so to speak
lets say i value your advice just as much as i do the therapists
youre serious arent you
i think sex is a serious matter
its one of the most persistent themes in the bible
so is it possible for me to know a woman in the biblical sense and do i want to find out
and you want my opinion
father brendan contemplates for a few moments
he looks up at the statue of jesus then makes a decision
i know in my heart that hell give you a free pass on this one
go for it
i said go for it
if you feel up to it
do you feel up to it
to tell the truth im scared
then we should pray
father brendan and mark pray together
sweet jesus mark and i sit at your feet and pray that you bless this little journey this one small step for a man
rod is wheeling mark along in his gurney
i really feel proud of myself imposing on someone i hardly know to fornicate in their home
get over it
its perfectly normal
they arrive at carmens place
carmen in her electric wheelchair is the woman mark had earlier interviewed
she pushes a button on a remote control which opens concertina double doors which reveal an adjacent bedroom
the bed itself is set at a perfect height for someone in a wheelchair or gurney
the room has been decked out with flowers candles and incense
carmen points to the bedside table
there are all sorts of useful things in that drawer there if you guys feel like exploring
mark doesnt even begin to get it
no ill bring my own sheets towels and anything else we need
everything will be provided
im honored that you asked me
itll be great karma for the house
rod is wheeling mark back home
great karma for the house
my god the pressure already
i cant stand it
we are outside an old style wooden house with a volvo wagon parked in front
a phone rings
we hear the sound of sneakers on a wood floor
tony an adolescent with a pony tail picks up the phone
hey this is tony
he listens then looks away from the phone and shouts
what is it
he talks into the mouthpiece
she is in her mid s
she grabs the phone puts her hand over the mouthpiece and glares at tony
im not your girlfriend
when someone calls particularly someone you dont know you can use the word mom
tony glares back
cheryl takes off her right earring
hullo this is cheryl
hi its laura
i havent heard from you in a while
how are you
look i called to ask how you would feel about working with a severely disabled client
suddenly cheryl notices that tony has opened the refrigerator and is drinking straight out of the orange juice bottle
hold on a moment please
she covers the mouthpiece of the phone
hey cut that out
he takes no notice
she puts the phone down and moves towards him
he closes the fridge door and runs
mark is having a bed bath
his shoulders and neck are covered with soap suds
rod is washing his back
the phone rings
would you get it please
rod eases mark back onto the rubber mattress and goes to answer the phone
hullo mark obriens phone
he switches it to speaker so mark can hear
hi this is cheryl cohen greene
may i speak to mark
rod holds the phone toward mark like a question
marks face looks drained of blood
just one moment please
rod switches the phone off speaker
what am i doing here
yes or no
make up your mind
mark hesitates then nods weakly
rod puts the phone back on speaker
hullo this is mark
laura called to introduce you
i understand youd like to meet
is that right
mark can hardly speak
he eventually forces the sound from his throat
i could see you on the seventeenth at eleven oclock
would that be any good for you
uh yes i think that would be fine for me
hey where you from
wouldnt want to paint it
cheryl is on the phone holding the receiver with one hand while she puts away groceries with the other
well be talking for a while to begin with
then if you agree we can also start doing some body awareness exercises in your first session
the iron lung pumps away
mark is alone
he stares at the picture of the virgin mary
holy mother of god what are body awareness exercises
vera lets herself in
vera holds up two shirts for mark to see a dark red and a light blue
mark is lying on his side shirtless
his face is even more grim than when we last saw it
will you stop acting as if youre going to your own execution
im not acting
vera wheels mark to his doom
try and think of something else
baseball for example
thats what they usually tell boys to do
who are they
vera rings the front doorbell
vera says nothing
she rings the bell again
my god shes forgotten or shes gotten the date wrong
okay we might as well turn round and go back
come on lets go
she hasnt forgotten
from inside the house we hear the faint buzz of an electric wheelchair approaching
the door opens
mark closes his eyes in despair
vera eases mark onto the bed positioning him so that he can see the doorway
as a finishing touch she dabs a little cologne behind his ears then puts the mouthpiece of his respirator within easy reach
carmen picks up her bag and wheels herself to the door
okay im going
ill be back some time after one
if im not here just let yourselves out
she lets herself out
whats the time
twelve after eleven
i think theres a strong possibility shes had second thoughts
mark please calm down
and if she does arrive she would be perfectly within her rights to turn around and run
the doorbell rings
they stare at the door
vera finally goes over and opens it
silhouetted against the light is cheryl with a substantial bag
she could be the avon lady
she has a light blouse light skirt and her long hair is loose
hi im cheryl
im sorry im late
no thats fine
im vera im one of marks helpers
cheryl sees mark
there is no noticeable reaction in her face just a smile
hi mark obrien
mark clears his throat with a little difficulty
hi cheryl cohen greene
vera is already at the front door
ill be back say in two hours
yes two hours that would be perfect
she closes the door behind her
mark feels totally abandoned
mark blurts out
your moneys on the dresser
cheryl walks over to the dresser
when her back is turned mark screws up his face in self disgust
she finds an envelope
she puts it in her bag
mark eyes her carefully
that was the wrong way to start off
yes it was
shall we start again
please you start
she sits down on the bed and looks at him
it is a very frank stare
she is trying to take a lot in
although the aim is for us to have sex im not a prostitute and you dont need to pay me up front
ive nothing against prostitutes but theres a difference
we can talk about that later
the other thing is there is a limit to the number of sessions we can have together
did laura mention that when you saw her
im sorry i dont remember
the limit is six
but that gives us plenty of opportunity to explore
now i understand you are able to have an erection
yes but not out of choice
do you know how many men there are on this planet who would give anything for a natural erection
she looks around the room
is this your place
no its a friends
the only bedroom furniture i have at my place is an iron lung
ive sometimes thought about buying a futon in case the need arose
its worth thinking about
ive got the space
it can be expensive though a nice futon
i mean how much do you think a good one would cost
mark just take a deep breath then let go
do i seem anxious
you do a little
cheryl lies down beside him
laura told me you were a poet
whats it like to be a poet
its a way of living inside your own head which is where i spend most of my time
but not today
by the way i like your shirt
he smiles genuinely flattered
so i need to ask you some basic questions
what is the iron lung for
it keeps me breathing
i can spend a few hours outside of it with my portable respirator depending on how i feel
but i work and sleep in the iron lung
how do you feel right now
out of my league
i meant your breathing
in fact better than usual
do you have any areas of unusual sensitivity
any parts of your body you dont want me to touch
i have normal sensitivity all over
its just that my muscles dont work
you can touch me anywhere
shall we get undressed then
mark is taken by surprise by the suddenness of it
he hesitates momentarily
cheryl starts to unbutton his shirt
marks terror is visible in his eyes and she can also feel his heart palpitating
she starts to slowly extract one of marks arms from his shirt sleeve
suddenly he lets out a piercing scream
she recoils shocked
holy mother of god
tell me whats wrong
she discovers that his fingers have been snagged in the fabric of the shirt and his fingers are being bent backward
okay okay ive got it
she carefully frees his fingers and eases the sleeve off
be careful please
mark im going to be really careful with you
i dont want to hurt or injure you in any way but its really not sexy when you yell at me
i wont yell at you any more
but youll tell me calmly the moment anything starts to hurt
now lets do the other arm
little by little she extracts the other arm
he grimaces his way through it but more in fear than in pain
she finally sets his shirt down on the end of the bed
you already said that
i guess im a little anxious too
she undoes the top of his pants
okay im going to slide these down
hold your breath
he screams in fear more than pain
no dont do that
cheryl sits down on the edge of the tub and takes a couple of deep breaths
mark his body now under the sheets looks towards the bathroom door
he can hear the sound of water running
he looks at a wall clock and notes the passing of time
cheryl turns off the tap
she has done a great job of pulling herself together and is wrapped in a kimono which she has brought herself
cheryl emerges from the bathroom and starts to undress
cheryl continues undressing mark looks away
okay the difference between me and a prostitute is that i dont want your return business
im here to help you communicate about your sexual feelings so you can share them with a future partner
she stands there for a few moments but he keeps his eyes averted
she turns back the sheets gets into bed beside him and he finally looks at her
whenever im naked everyone else in the room is usually dressed
now that im in bed with another naked person im very confused
she strokes his hair
so why is it confusing
id always expected that god or my parents would intervene to keep this moment from happening
she slides her hand down
she can feel his heart thumping
mark close your eyes and focus on your sense of touch
he closes his eyes
id like you to tell me how it feels each time i touch a different part of your body
if something feels good tell me
if something feels ticklish or bothers you let me know
i dont want you to tolerate anything
im going to start with the top of your head
she strokes his hair
you have soft hair
its nice to the touch
so you like it
she moves her fingers round behind his ear then the front of his ear
that feels weird
or weird bad
she moves her hand down his neck
everything good so far except the ear
she moves her fingers along his side very very lightly
for mark so far this is the best
are these the body awareness exercises
youre clever to have worked that out
her hands massage their way down his torso
marks reactions are a little like shock waves
people tell me im very perceptive
would you like to see what i feel like
she carefully takes his hand and caresses the fingers around one of her breasts then puts his hand back
cheryls hands move further down his body
are you wearing cologne
mmm my favorite brand
okay im going to move my hand along your stomach
and down to your pen
the expression on marks face changes to one of shock then agony then ecstasy
the clock on the mantelpiece says
cheryl is now fully dressed
she snaps open her briefcase takes out a diary with a pen attached then walks over to the bed sits down beside mark and flips through the pages
next week friday the twentieth same time
thats good for me
next time well start to work on intercourse
she gathers her things together and gets up
were you afraid at the thought of seeing me
i was terrified
you can be proud of yourself
you did great
weve made real progress
can i ask you something
what would you like to ask
tell me something about yourself
im a very private person
i have a private life i do need you to be aware of that but thats about it
this therapy is about you
there is a discreet knock at the front door and then a key turns in the lock
a few moments later carmen and vera come in
i hope you guys kept the noise down
vera wheels mark back the way they came
she is very discreet and they travel in silence for a while
finally curiosity overcomes her
how do you feel
cleansed and victorious
doesnt get any better than that
tell me about your first sexual experience
let me think
it wasnt all that pleasant
i mean it was consensual and everything and i really was in love with the guy but his dick seemed enormous to me i didnt think it would fit
it was scary
but he was nice
i guess he couldnt help it
was he chinese
are you kidding
i only hung out with white guys at high school
why is that
i dont know
to stick it to my mum and dad i suppose
are they happy now youve got a chinese boyfriend
whats his dick like
why do you call it a dick instead of a penis
penis sounds like some vegetable you dont want to eat
dick sounds like what it is
they continue in silence for a little while
the thing is it was all over so damn quickly
yes tell me about it
cheryls car is parked outside
the house is mostly dark
cheryl is at a tiny desk dictating into a recorder
mark is the oldest of four children and raised catholic
he was extremely nervous
he yelled a lot when i took off his shirt but i think more out of fear than pain
he cannot masturbate
has only had the occasional kissing experience
he is capable of achieving an erection easily but the unusual curvature of his body could be a serious obstacle to intercourse
she puts the recorder away in a file drawer and locks the drawer with a key which she keeps with her
cheryl gets into bed beside her husband josh who is apparently asleep
this gentleman i just started working with
he spends most of his life trapped in a big metal box
her husband josh turns over and mumbles something completely incomprehensible
she nudges him
did you hear what i said
yes i heard what you said
youre a saint
he kisses her
dont forget to put the trash out in the morning
she turns around and goes to sleep
mark is in the little side chapel with father brendan
i dont know what i had envisaged it would be like the first time i mean
but that wasnt the image i had
i thought there would be more to it
not that it was unpleasant
after all i was in bed with a naked woman
she complimented me on my shirt and my hair
she held my penis
i havent even seen my penis for over thirty years
am i sharing too much
no im used to it
mark is in his iron lung
with his mouth stick he turns the page of one of those anatomical instruction books on sex
there are the typical graphic cross section diagrams of penises entering vaginas
ravels bolero plays quietly in the background as he reads to himself
sometimes the head of the penis may be too large to penetrate the vaginal opening smoothly in which case the application of lubricant is recommended to avoid possible
oh my god
this time rod is wheeling mark
he seems only slightly less anxious than the first time but still noticeably anxious
whats on the menu today
were attempting intercourse
thats a big one
what do you think of it
overrated but necessary
theres plenty of other ways of achieving the same result but somehow you dont feel youve actually done it till youve gone all the way in
this does not help marks state of mind
cheryl takes off her clothes
i want you to look at me this time
go on lift your eyes look at me
he lifts his eyes
do you like watching me undress
as she moves towards the bed almost naked the last thing she takes off is her bra
from now on
she pulls back the bed covers and gets into bed with mark
youre going to start to understand the signals from your body
their bodies touch
he looks blissful
and learn how to control
marks expression of bliss turns to one of anger and frustration
mark is in the side chapel with father brendan
i did it again
this time i ejaculated on her thigh
father brendan winces
i felt cursed that the whole enterprise was cursed
it seemed like a totally just punishment
god wasnt actually denying my sexuality
he was merely pointing out to me how useless it was
its amazing to me how often god is brought into the sex act
i understand that even amongst non believers the most common expression of sexual ecstasy is oh god
cheryl returns from the bathroom and slides back into bed
okay i dont want to hear any more about god cursing you
i want the credit
it was my overpowering beauty that did it
it took you by surprise
now where were we
what do you mean where were we
im going to touch you
im touching you
and when we both feel youre aroused then im going to guide you into my vagina
is there anything i need to do
close your eyes feel your body thats all you need to do
mark closes his eyes
in his minds eye he sees the saintly figures in the beautiful stained glass windows of the church with the afternoon sun blazing through
an equally saintly but naked amanda floats towards him her arms beckoning
when he opens his eyes cheryl is straddling him but in a leaning tower of pisa sort of way
it is a struggle for her but somehow she is managing to get mark into a workable position for intercourse
suddenly he panics
it wont fit
its not going to fit
no mark it will fit just fine
no its dangerous
its too big
its not too big
it wont fit
its too risky
please stop this
i promise you nothing bad will happen
now lets try again while youre still hard
she attempts to guide him in again
mark grimaces makes a strange noise
we realize that he has just ejaculated again involuntarily
cheryl steps out of the shower
cheryl gets into bed
im really sorry
stop being sorry
and stop reading those stupid sex manuals
she snuggles up beside mark
we still have some time
we can talk which you seem to like or you can suck on my nipples which you also seem to like
or which one would you like to do first
gradually mark is reassured
cheryls volvo is parked in its usual spot out front
there is one light on in the house
cheryl is at her desk dictating her notes
she also has a notepad with some jottings
mark seemed to be at his most relaxed when i sucked his penis
at the moment he is fixated on penis vagina and his anxiety is focused around that
the root of his anxiety is his parents and his religion
he believes he doesnt deserve sex
he believes he is responsible for his little sisters death at the age of seven because his mother was too busy looking after him
a copy of cheryls notes comes through on lauras fax machine
we hear her familiar limp as she comes over to collect them
she reads the notes with interest
we discussed his fantasies
they are mostly masochistic
again the idea of being punished
he has never seen female genitalia before and seems quite frightened by the idea
mark and father brendan are in the little chapel
im sorry to lay all this on you father
my worry now is that its never going to happen
im never going to have intercourse with cheryl or any other woman
maybe intercourse would prove i was an adult
maybe i dont want to cross that line
maybe this was a bad idea
do you want to know what i think
id forget the psychobabble
i grew up on a farm
it even takes the animals a few times to get it right
can i suggest you try and enjoy it more
dont worry about the technical stuff
youre a poet
vera wheels mark and his gurney to a rack in front of the store
she takes shirts and models them for mark
he settles on a daring but beautiful silk shirt
a man in a pink unitard rides by on a unicycle
vera carefully does up the buttons on marks new silk shirt
mark looks thoughtful
only a little
would you like a shpritz
yes of course i would
vera gets a bottle of cologne and gives mark a couple of bursts behind the ears
i have a good feeling about today a very good feeling
i had a terrible feeling it was never going to happen but i think todays the day
can i make a suggestion
stop thinking about it
vera wheels mark up to the front door
you couldnt have wished for nicer weather
youre not listening are you
i said stop thinking about it
she steps up to ring the bell then hesitates
there is something of a hubbub coming from inside
both she and mark can hear it clearly
the doorbell rings amidst a loud background chatter
we reveal a roomful of women gathered for some intense group activity of some kind
carmen buzzes her way to the front door in her wheelchair
she opens it
she has an expression of horror
oh my god i forgot
oh mark im so sorry
the entire roomful of women stare at mark and vera
in the background we see cheryls car pull up
cheryl mark and vera are by the car
mark looks grim
she was very apologetic
they are all shaking their heads
cheryl has a thought
look it may not be exactly what we had in mind but i noticed theres quite a nice motel just a couple of blocks from here
maybe its worth checking out
mark and cheryl wait outside while vera goes in
have you got anything on the ground floor
the motel clerk is also chinese
he looks at the rack of keys
ive got a single
thirty five plus tax
my boss is the gentleman in the gurney
hes supposed to be having a therapy session right now but the facility we normally use had a scheduling mix up
we only need the room for two hours
can you do it for twenty cash
the clerk leads them to the room and opens the door
theres a soda machine around the corner
and an ice machine if you need it
im sure itll come in handy
cheryl vera and the gurney enter the room
the clerk watches in the background
cheryl and vera lower mark onto the bed
allowing for the gurney there is not a lot of space left in the room
okay ill see you
ive got a book to read
ill just hang around the reception if you need me
mark looks around
some people find motels exciting
do you think i could be one of those people
she sits on the bed and starts to undo his shirt
another nice shirt
as in racy and sophisticated
you took the words right out of my mouth
vera is having coffee with the clerk
whats wrong with your boss
basically he can only move his head
so what sort of therapy are they doing
theyre having sex
youre bullshitting me
okay im bullshitting you
no tell me for real what are they actually doing
well today after some appropriate foreplay theyre going to try to achieve full penetration
the clerk stares at her
we see cheryl from the breasts up
we hear violent coughing from down below
im choking cheryl moves away
we realize she has been perched astride his face more or less
the coughing continues
mark looks a bit panicked
the mouth piece
cheryl locates the mouth piece to his oxygen supply and puts it between his lips
after a few breaths he is relatively relaxed
she lies down beside him
i guess that ones off the menu until further notice
mark finally lets go of the mouth piece
he looks melancholy
she does not fail to notice
come on lighten up will you
he seems to be lost in some memory
pony girl pony girl wont you be my pony girl
he looks at cheryl
that was what my father used to sing to my little sister karin
that was before she died
she was kind of a sad little girl
it didnt do much good
im really sorry that the last time i saw her i fought with her
i made her cry
marks eyes begin to look teary
my parents could have left me in the nursing home you know
they found out the average life expectancy for polios in nursing homes was months
so they took me home
they gave me a life
cheryl props herself up on one elbow
mark im just going to go the bathroom for a quick pee
when i come back were going to achieve full penetration
but before i go i want you to close your eyes
is this a game
no its not a game
just do as i say
close your eyes
he closes his eyes
picture yourself as a six year old boy at the beach
can you do that
yes very easily
the scene has a hazy dreamlike reality
we see the six year old mark able bodied and full of energy running and playing in the sand with his dog
describe some of your feelings
i feel very exhilarated running next to the atlantic ocean feeling the wind and the wet sand between my toes
do you really feel like him
yes i really feel like him
but can you really picture him
i dont understand what you mean
i said i can feel like him
of course i can picture him
from the outside i mean as an adult as you are now looking at him with his crew cut and his little face
and are you mad at him
do you blame him for getting polio
was it his fault
cheryl gets up and goes to the bathroom
mark is obviously affected by her question
mark has a faraway look
she either forgot to close the bathroom door or didnt bother to close it
mark pauses as he hears some distant footsteps
father brendan looks over his shoulder
they finally pass
i found the sound of her peeing incredibly erotic and the sound of her tearing off toilet paper incredibly intimate
by the time she came back i had a terrific boner
cheryl gets herself into position on top of mark
im going to rub the tip of your cock around my vulva
when its ready ill guide you in
breathe slowly and think of something delicious
through his minds eye we see a succession of images
fingertips stroking a cats fur
in the background the sound of tom toms
a tribal initiation rite
drums dancing trances
then ravels bolero
clint eastwood saying make my day
suddenly and with a big yell mark comes
vera is still there reading her book
the clerk looks at his watch
theyve been in there a long time
yes some people can do that
he does not get it
do you want another coffee
do you live with your parents
you at berkeley
you have a boyfriend
mark and cheryl are lying together
he has his eyes closed
there is something on her mind
to answer your earlier question i grew up in salem brought up catholic like you but the church didnt appreciate my attitude towards sex
you had an attitude towards sex
yes i liked it
they like to think they threw me out but i threw them out
so for years i didnt believe in anything and now im converting to judaism
i guess its good to have some kind of insurance
i didnt think of that
then why are you doing it
my husband asked me to do it before his grandmother dies
the idea is if it makes her happy and him happy then it will do the same for me
our son is neutral on the subject but theoretically if it looks like it makes me happy itll make him happy too
thats the way my husbands family talks and thinks
the fact that im happy already doesnt seem to be relevant
whats your sons name
hes years old and very smart
youd like him
cheryl and mark lie together in contented silence for a while
does he know what you do
he knows im a sex therapist
theres a certificate on the wall
but he hasnt had sex yet
how much can he really know
hes not a boy hes not a man
how much do you want him to know
well i want him to have some idea in his head
i hope its a nice one
what does your husband do
hes a philosopher
you mean like at a university
no in his own mind
he runs the house plays guitar thinks a lot
she notices the time
its kind of late
she gets up and starts to get dressed
hey we did really good stuff today
you were fantastic
youre a fully fledged male homo sapiens endowed with a handsome and substantial penis which now has a proven track record
you should be pleased
was i really inside you
you were really and truly inside me
for how long
five or six seconds
is that all
thats a long time for some people
you were pretty excited
i dont know what you were thinking about
im sorry i couldnt tell one thing from another
it was all a jumble of sensations
well you definitely achieved penetration
it was penis vagina all the way
and you definitely get an a for orgasm
she is ready to go
she comes over to mark and kisses him on the cheek
did you come
no mark i didnt
can we try for that next time
she hesitates for a moment
if thats what you want
yes thats what i want
laura is on the phone to cheryl
hows it going
cheryl is at her desk
he reads too many books
he has it in his head that after meeting three times we should be able to have penetrative sex which results in simultaneous orgasm
just like that
thats very funny
yes it is
what do you think of him
i said what do you think of him
i like him
father brendan approaches and arrives at the front door
rod lets him in
mark is in his iron lung
father brendan wearing civilian clothes comes in with a pack of beer
i was in the neighborhood
how are you
so on reflection are you
it was okay
i liked some of the other things just as much or better but im glad its behind me
well so am i
when this is all over im going to write an article about it
after all sex sells
so youre really doing this for the money
well that makes me feel much better about the whole thing
can i ask what shes like
youve never really said anything about her
shes the most wonderful person on the planet
im glad we finally had intercourse because now i realize that everything i do with her feels just great
as usual cheryls car is out front
cheryl crawls into bed beside josh
she lies there with her eyes wide open unable to sleep her mind full of thoughts
although she has not yet noticed josh is also awake
whats on your mind
dont believe you
okay ive been thinking about the whole conversion thing
still dont believe you
then whatever it is i guess im not in the mood for talking
what sort of mood are you in
another sort of mood
they get into the business
mark is also awake staring at nothing his mind full of thoughts
as a distraction he eventually turns and looks at the picture of the virgin mary
so what do you think
the phone rings
we hear footsteps approaching
cheryl answers it
hullo this is cheryl
mark is in his iron lung
can we meet somewhere for a coffee
i dont normally meet with clients outside of working hours you know that
how could you possibly describe anything to do with me as normal
we dont have to talk about business
a waiter approaches cheryl and mark with two beautifully made cups of coffee
one of them has a straw accompanying it
he sets them down
mark looks up at the waiter
could you put my cup right on the edge of the table there and stick the straw in my mouth please
the waiter does exactly as asked
is that okay
sir id wait a couple of minutes
that coffee is pretty hot
the waiter leaves
mark and cheryl look at each other
so what shall we talk about
we dont have to do much talking
cheryl smiles at him
she is looking gorgeous today
then why are we here
i just want to be seen with you in public
i find that as sexy as anything weve done so far
he sips on his coffee and soaks her in with his eyes
im glad you enjoy looking after all
i want people to say whos the guy with the blonde
how did he get so lucky
or so rich
okay if some old girlfriend from school you hadnt seen for years turned up suddenly like right now how would you introduce me
as your boyfriend
no as my husband
why not go all the way
does that shock you
then i guess it would shock her as well
my old school friend thats going to come along any moment
you really can picture me as husband material
as long as were pretending sure
would you write down your address for me please
josh walks unhurriedly to the letter box at the front gate and collects the mail
as he flips through the envelopes he stops at one which is addressed to cheryl sniffs it then opens it
it contains a sheet of paper on which is typed what seems to be a poem
he reads it with interest which develops into mild shock
cheryl and josh are in the kitchen arguing
you said yourself its not supposed to get personal
thats another thing altogether
what i want to know is where do you get off opening my mail
it was scented
i assumed it was just junk mail
even less reason to open it
where is it
give it to me
youre not getting it
this is absolutely none of your fucking business
youre still not getting it
i threw it out
i fucking did
tony arrives home from school
as he comes in his parents fall silent
he realizes he has walked in on an argument
he looks at both of them
a little later
the three of them are sitting round the dining table eating dinner in total silence
the hostility between cheryl and josh is palpable
when josh finally does speak he addresses tony
would you please ask your mother to pass the salt
cheryl would you please pass the salt
cheryl glares at tony and goes on with her meal
cheryl is at the dining table with her recorder and file in front of her plus a late night snack
mark appears to be indulging in typical transference behaviour
this is not unusual after first successful intercourse but i think he is especially susceptible
he cannot help seeing me as the multi functional all purpose woman mother sister schoolmistress whore lover and best friend
at the same time his anxiety about sexual performance has diminished
josh crawls into bed with cheryl
she is still awake
he snuggles up to her
i really upset you before
no you didnt
yes i promise
yes ive come around to your point of view
you were right
youre generally right about these things
it was quite a nice poem
i mean nothing astounding but heartfelt at least
josh i need to go to sleep
cheryl rummages around in the kitchen garbage
she finds nothing
she storms off to the laundry flings open a cupboard pokes around and comes up with a flashlight
cheryl makes her way to the end of the yard
holding the flashlight between her teeth she rummages around in the outdoor trash bin
finally she finds what she is looking for
she takes the poem out of the envelope and reads it
let me touch you with my words
for my hands lie limp as empty gloves
she goes over to the back steps sits down and continues reading
she puts it back in the envelope and walks back inside the house
she is visibly affected
from behind we see vera wheeling mark in his gurney
another female figure creeps up beside vera and whispers in her ear all unbeknownst to mark
the other female figure takes over from vera who trails along a few feet behind
mark remains unaware
he has a new and different looking shirt even more out there than the previous one
do you think shell like the shirt
i like it
does that count
mark can barely believe it
they are stopped at a park bench
vera is hovering in the background out of earshot
its been a while
im going to germany
i wanted to say goodbye to you before i left
why are you going to germany
to study german
for how long
one or two years maybe
but we should keep in touch
but why go to germany
its the only place in the world where humor is actually forbidden
she laughs then smiles quietly then touches him
you could always make me laugh
i love you mark
i really do
marks face is a picture of anguish and confusion
yes i love you but not in that way
i love you but im not in love with you
blah blah blah
you know how it goes
mark lets out a deep meaningful sigh
for a time he and father brendan maintain a respectful silence
i think its great what youre doing with this surrogate lady
she leans over and kisses mark on the lips
it could have been you
it could have been but it wasnt
i had this faint hope that she would show the merest hint of jealousy
it shows you how naive i am
the fact that i was no longer a virgin that i was a made man so to speak made no difference to her at all
cheryls car is in the parking lot
we see her draw the blinds
clerk takes two beers from a mini bar and hands one to vera
you want to go out some time
no i dont think so
what your boyfriend
no im busy thats all
whats wrong with this anyway
were having a nice time arent we
or do you have things to do
i can go for a walk if youre busy and come back later
no no stay
is this going to be a regular thing
i dont know
im not the therapist
what sort of a therapist is she really
i told you the first time shes a sex therapist
the clerk looks at her closely
she appears to have a completely straight face
today theyre working on simultaneous orgasm
mark and cheryl are in bed their faces close
boy am i glad to see you
dont you say that to all the girls
yes but i always mean it
then cheryls head slides down and disappears from view
remember about the breathing
concentrate on breathing out rather than in
think of anything neutral
sky water trees ships music nothing too dramatic
mark closes his eyes
the first time i really didnt know what was going on
technically it all happened but nothing really happened in my head
this time it did and my head has never experienced anything like it before
of course i ignored cheryls advice about having neutral thoughts
amanda is giving mark a pole dancing demonstration complete with disco beat and mirror ball lighting
mark opens his eyes and looks up at cheryl
she seems divine
his excitement increases
we hear the change in his breathing
also in her breathing
the expression of elation on marks face morphs dramatically into something else
then afterwards there was this moment this glimpse of an awful sadness to come
father brendan closes his eyes and nods knowingly
the volvo is parked out front
the envelope is still on the dash
cheryl is dictating
mark achieved an erection as soon as i started to suck on him
he did the controlled breathing as i had suggested and i was able to get on top and guide him in quite easily
we see marks face from cheryls pov
his eyes are still closed
is it in
is it really in
yes its really in
we hear marks thoughts
i couldnt believe it
we hear the sound of typing
mark is in his iron lung typing
at the top of the page we can see the title of the piece on seeing a sex surrogate page
i was finally there
too soon i came
but she kept holding me inside her
then a look of pleasure brushed lightly over her face
we see cheryls face from marks pov
it is as beatific as we have ever seen it
as though an all day itch were finally being scratched
letting me go she put her hands down on the bed by my shoulders and kissed my chest
this act of affection moved me deeply
cheryls actions follow marks description
mark is with father brendan
i almost wept
no one had ever kissed me there before
it was so unexpected and so natural
cheryls lips move away from marks chest
she kisses him on the lips light and lingering
as soon as there is enough space between them he whispers to her
i love you
she whispers back
i love you too
did you come
cheryl continues dictating
mark is breathing well and learning to pace himself
there is no real physical impediment to a variety of sexual activities given the right sort of partner
his deeper emotional needs are outside the scope of my potential involvement
cheryl pauses then goes on
as anticipated this was the final session
he seems to have some understanding of what is going on
he and cheryl hug
they are still in the same intimate position
what happens when
what happens when what
when people become attached to each other
whats the chemistry of it all
when people are attracted to each other
are you attracted to me
were just talking hypothetically
hypothetically they write poems they have sex
and what happens next
after poetry and sex
nothing or everything
the rest is by negotiation as it were
what do you mean
i mean you can just leave it at love and attraction or you can make things complicated
as most people do
the clerk looks bored
vera looks at the time
she seems a little anxious
can i use that phone to call the room
the phone rings cheryl picks it up
cheryl already dressed is getting mark dressed
she does up every button of his shirt lovingly
what shall we do next time
mark doesnt answer
she finishes buttoning him up in silence
a strange feeling a kind of chill that cheryl senses pervades the atmosphere
we have two sessions left is that correct
or we could stop now
you mean make this the last session
there is a pregnant pause
what do you think we should do
its not we its you mark
its up to you
i want to know how you feel
that doesnt come in to it
yes it does
i dont just write poems to anyone
mark what do you want me to say
how much i was touched by that
how special this has been to me
is that going to help you
no its going to make things worse
you mean to say come the sixth session that will be it
yes that will be it
i explained that the first time we met
mark has a serious and painful moment
if its any consolation its also hard for me to think about it
then maybe we should pull the plug now
i think maybe we should
its only going to get harder
i guess you might as well save the money
maybe buy yourself a nice futon
cheryl is getting dressed
mark watches pensively
she pauses and looks at him
he keeps a brave face
there is a knock on the door
just a moment
she and mark make eye contact for the last time
they manage to smile at each other
i desperately wanted to feel that because of cheryl my life had changed
but it hadnt
apart from her usual things she is also carrying a long mirror
bye mark bye
as cheryl goes out vera comes in
everything all right
he did great
im sorry i have to run
vera walks in and closes the door behind her
cheryl goes to her car and opens the trunk
as she is putting the mirror inside the chinese clerk who is showing a couple to their room gives her an odd look
cheryl takes no notice gets in her car and starts the engine
just then vera runs up and taps on her window
the window winds down
vera hands cheryl an envelope with money in it
at first cheryl just looks at it then realizes what it is
you forgot this
i knew there was a reason i came here today
vera waves goodbye as she goes and cheryl sits contemplating the envelope in her lap
then she tosses it onto the dash and drives away
vera wheels mark home
they travel in silence
father brendan and mark are together in the chapel
i felt id just been through a ceremony that i didnt know the meaning of
i kept thinking is that all there is
just an empty hole at the end of it
a bigger hole than there was before
im sorry mark you cant always trust your feelings
youve achieved a great thing
it may take you a while to realize that
it is a moonlit night
on the opposite wall from the virgin mary is a picture of amanda and mark
mark lies in his iron lung staring at it
i wrote letters to amanda in germany
five six pages long a year passed heard nothing
was it my fault
of course it was
but the guilt isnt enough to patch over the rage
i pound the insides of my mind with words such puny fists and nobody hears
the poem ends and we hear instead a radio broadcast of a giants game
mark is engrossed
suddenly the broadcast stops
the digital read out on the clock radio which says disappears
a street light visible through the window goes out
the electric pump under marks iron lung whirrs to a halt
we hear the sound of air escaping then an eerie silence
even the cat is motionless
for a few moments mark seems hypnotized
then he twists his head and clamps onto his mouth stick
he manoeuvres it over to the speaker button on the phone and manages to press it in the semi darkness
we hear a dial tone
there is an answering machine on a bedside table
hi this is rod
leave a message or not
rod its mark
i need help
the powers gone out including the pump on the iron lung
id say ive got about three hours before i start to turn blue
i hope you get this in time
mark winces in frustration
nine one one
he swings the mouth stick over to the button
as he presses it he loses his grip and the mouth stick falls to the floor
at first he seems panicky but after a few moments he begins to control his breathing and gradually psyches himself into a strange calm
so this is how it ends
we see mark from a high angle
more time passes
we see marks face as he slips into unconsciousness
cheryl enters the room wrapped in a white terry cloth robe
the room is dominated by a small beautifully tiled immersion pool with a hand rail and steps
the mikvah lady gets up from her chair and approaches her
is this your first time
yes it is
she takes off her robe and hands it to the mikvah lady who does not fail to notice cheryls body
so what do you do
cheryl closes her eyes and thinks for a moment
i dont think youd understand
you can try me
im a housewife
why shouldnt i understand
i guess i was mistaken
cheryl steps towards the pool
i see youre very comfortable with being naked
she takes hold of the rail and puts her foot in the water
that has never been one of my problems
sometimes new brides come with their mothers
do i have to take this off
can i please leave this on
theyve never been naked before
no honey it all has to come off
and it does
cheryl takes another step into the water
and it does
they stand on the edge of that pool without anything to cling to but themselves
nothing to hide behind
this is your body
this is the body that god crafted for you
cheryl immerses herself up to her chest
go completely under the water without touching the walls or anything
she immerses completely
we see her under the water
she hears a voice in the distance her own voice
at the same time there is a look of elation in her eyes
okay mark you can open your eyes now
mark is on the bed alone
he opens his eyes
this is your body
a few feet in front of mark cheryl is holding a full length mirror
the angle is such that he can see all of himself
he is mesmerized by his own image
flashes of light from the mirror flicker over his face
so this is the body that someone was able to love
not quite as bad as i thought
overhead fluorescent lights flash by as we observe the ceiling from marks point of view
we also hear the sound of rapidly rolling rubber wheels and a voice
mark can you hear me
open your eyes
mark is in a regular hospital bed with a temporary plastic cocoon over him in place of his iron lung
there is a volunteer called susan in the room with him
theyll be letting you go today
whoever looks after you will leave the portable respirator switched on at night fully charged so youll have at least one back up system
how close was i
you know to that tunnel thing and the light and the voice saying dont go near the light
is that what you remember
i assume i passed out
before that i remember feeling sorry for myself
do you feel relieved now
i mean im relieved that rod got to me in time but i still feel sorry for myself
im sure theres a cure for that
would you like to talk to someone
i feel comfortable talking to you
im only a volunteer not a therapist
i can refer you to someone if you like
mark breaks into a broad smile then a chuckle
im sorry i dont mean to be rude
im just smiling at the idea that a therapist could do anything useful for me right now
my priest couldnt
are you religious
i would find it absolutely intolerable not to be able to blame someone for all this
no i dont go to any church and i dont think about god very much
but i believe theres a mysterious logic or poetry to life
i guess that makes me a spiritual type
yes that would count
would you like me to visit you
are you married
do you have a steady boyfriend
then please visit as often as you can
mark is loaded into an ambulance
theres just one more thing i want to tell you
she gets into the ambulance and squats down next to him
im not a virgin
she looks genuinely pleased to hear it
so are you in a relationship at the moment
no it was a passing thing
the driver is ready to shut the doors
thanks for sharing that with me
she gets out of the ambulance and waves
mark is accompanied by an ambulance officer
we see clear blue sky through the back windows
the sun shines in and warms marks face
he closes his eyes in contentment
nice day isnt it
good to be alive huh
we see the disappearing figure of susan from the point of view of the departing ambulance
i met susan five years before i died
she was the love of my life
we had the same priorities baseball pretty much came first and we wrote each other mushy poems
i never expected it nor did she but thats often the way things turn out
rod shows father brendan into marks room
father brendan sits in a chair next to marks iron lung
that was quite something
what do you propose to do for an encore
yep i almost found out the big secret
but here i am back with the living
if there is another place then i think they took one look at me and decided to throw me back
and welcome back
and thank you for coming to visit
i know its been awhile since we talked about this
at the time you seemed to feel so badly about her
or about it
i no longer feel like that
father brendan is rather taken by surprise
thats good to hear
in the end youre glad that you did it
yes i am
in fact at this point in time i feel very blessed
they put me on this new anti depressant and now i can really see life from the cup half full rather than cup half empty point of view
father brendan looks truly amazed
it takes about six weeks to kick in but when it does you can really tell the difference
hey thats great
im pulling your leg father
im not on drugs
i have a girlfriend
youre kidding me
a real girlfriend
a very real girlfriend
she adores me
shell do anything for me
and i can get pretty kinky sometimes believe you me
her name is susan
is she pretty
she sure is
has she got a sister
as a matter of fact
no youre not
anyway were starting a publishing company together
father brendan smiles and shakes his head
here i was all prepared to offer comfort to the forlorn thats supposed to be my specialty and now i can just throw away that little speech
please make the little speech
id love to hear it
okay but ill try and keep it short
dont make it too short
the meaning of love
love is a journey
i already like it
there is a pause
thats all of ive got
i told you its short
love is a journey
father brendan lets himself out and walks back the way he came
there is definitely a smile on his face
mark also has a smile on his face as he lies awake
actually i was on drugs i was taking anti depressants and they were helping a bit
at least i was able to see the cup of life metaphor as a useful tool
of course the two halves were never even
not in my case thats for sure
look at all the years of unendurable crap ive had to put up with
that fills most of the cup
but in the little bit thats left what do i have to show for myself
at the very least three beautiful women who all loved me and will all show up at my funeral
josh saunters out to the mail box
he retrieves the mail sifts through it and pauses over a letter
he is tempted to open it but thinks better of it
cheryl is planting stuff in the back yard
josh approaches her with the letter
its from a susan fernbach
she takes it and opens it uncertainly somehow anticipating its contents
a full blown catholic funeral is happening
meaningful hugs are exchanged
eyes are dabbed
we hear marks voice
three reasons to live the mundane o god it was boring but i did it got it out of the way the transcendent we had this agreement god gave me
life for a while i gave him gratitude for a while and it worked out ok the curious you know how every day is different
i just wanted to see what would happen next father brendan delivers a eulogy
we see members of marks family all teary eyed
mark i know youre watching
im sorry my friend but we have to do this
just bear with me and i think you might like it
ive been branching out lately reading native american stories about the character of the trickster
sometimes he shows up as a coyote sometimes as a raven but he always does the unexpected
the trickster breaks the rules
mark obrien whose life were celebrating today was very much the trickster anyone who knew him knew that
besides his irreverent humor and alarming honesty he always did the unexpected
in nearly every aspect of his life mark did the unexpected
his was a dynamic voice in a paralyzed body a full life lived long after he should have been dead
he graduated from college wrote and published articles and poems and against all odds by his own admission entered into the fully human experience of physical love
in this way mark lived from day to day to day from breath to breath to breath for years
he loved and he was loved and in his quiet voice he spoke loud truths
we see rod vera and laura the therapist in various rows
also amanda holding a toddler in her arms and sitting next to a tall boring looking husband
susan fernbach will now read one of marks favorite poems
this is called love poem for no one in particular
we see susan at the lectern reading from a book
let me touch you with my words
for my hands lie limp as empty gloves
let my words stroke your hair slide down your back and tickle your belly
for my hands light and free flying as bricks ignore my wishes and stubbornly refuse to carry out my quietest desires
we see cheryl as deeply touched by the words as she was the first time
let my words enter your mind bearing torches
admit them willingly into your being so they may caress you gently within
in the middle of the room moonlit is marks iron lung empty and majestic with the cat sitting on top
as we move around the eerie capsule we hear the sound of the french can can slowly fade up
it continues over end credits
