b if window
href b b chasing amy chasing amy written by kevin smith a pile of comic books are on a shelf next to myriad others
the most prominent one is called bluntman and chronic
a hand reaches in and pulls one out of frame
holden opens the comic and flips through it he shakes his head
banky looks over his shoulder
felt like this fucking day would never come
issue two on the shelf
dont start alright
this is a cool moment and id appreciate you not trying to ruin it
how often does a guy get the opportunity to purchase something with his name on it
points to name on cover banky edwards right
points to the other holden mcneil
i know my name
cmon sour puss
we got the rest of our lives to be artists
but its supply and demand
and right now the unwashed masses demand this
off comic this is easy alright
and right now it pays the bills
just dont forget that were better than this
ill tell you who were better than these two fags right here
they approach the counter where steve dave the store manager and walt the fan boy play a card game
lays books on the counter alright old maids take a break from the crazy s marathon and ring us up
not looking up well well well walt did you see who it is
the local celebrities
quick get them to autograph one of their books so we can sell it for triple its value
im not that in need of fifteen cents right now
they snicker and high five one another
holden rolls his eyes
you guys operate the smallest ladies bridge circle ive ever seen
for your information were playing crimson mystical mages an overpower card game
not that either of you would give a shit about something as advanced as this there are no dick or poopie jokes involved
to holden i dont think theyre fans
no were not
youre both a couple of fucking no talents that got lucky
and obviously your handlers or hangers on convinced you that your first comic was good which it was not it was thoroughly mediocre with a few spiky bits of dialogue
and when you get your foot in the door of the business what do you do
you turn out a piece of shit like bluntman and chronic
tell him steve dave
off comic bluntman and chronic
what was that thing the little stoner pulled on the villain in the last issue
the stinky palm
you give comics a bad name i tell all my customers not to buy it to spend their money on a real comic book
fucking one hit wonder dime store frank millers
this is the reality at comic toast youre not going to get your ass kissed here because both me and walt think you suck
i said that
steve dave offers the boys his two middle fingers then goes back to playing his game with walt
holden and banky stare shocked
banky nudges holden and they both exit steve dave and the fan boy slap hands and go back to playing
ive got a dragon card forty power ups and twelve life points
i get your elf card
youre such a bitch
but thankfully ive saved a dark forces shaman card for just such an occasion
eighty six life power points to my twenty two
i schooled their asses now im schooling yours
a trash can crashes through the front window
steve dave and walt hit the deck like bitches covering one another
they look up slowly
steve dave leaps to his feet and looks at the shattered mess
he pulls something off the garbage can and reads it
you know it was those two fucks
lets call the cops and have them busted
i know where their studio is
or better yet lets sue
you can sue them steve dave
still reading note that wont be necessary
why the hell not
holds up check because this is a check for three times what that window cost
reading note dear critics thanks for the insight
but like my grandmother always said fuck em if they cant take a joke
and break their window
kiss it banky the hack
your card game blows
he said kiss it
a physically large fan sweaty brow tote bag bursting with comics leans forward smiling
could you sign it to a really big fan
holden sits at a table
across from the barely managing to stand fan
he offers him a patronizingly kind half smile in return you bet
were at a comic book show specifically at a book signing
behind holden hangs a large banner heralding holden mcneil and banky edwards creators of bluntman and chronic
beside it is a large mock up of the comic book cover which features two stoner super heroes who bear a striking resemblance to a pair of very familiar friendly
neighborhood drug dealers holden hands the book back to the fan
i love this book man
this shits awesome
i wish i was like these guys getting stoned talking all raw about chicks and fighting supervillains
i love these guys
theyre like cheech and chong meet bill and fed
i like to chink of them as rosencrantz and guildenstern meet vladimir and estragon
banky signs the book of another collector
so you draw this
signing the comic i ink it and im also the colorist
the guy next to me draws it
but we both came up with the characters whats that mean you ink it
it means that holden draws the pictures in pencil and then he gives it to me to go over in ink so you just trace
banky freezes up
he composes himself and continues signing
its not tracing
i add depth and shading to give the image mere definition
only then does the drawing really take shape
you go over what he draws with a pen thats tracing
hands book back to collector not really
calling out next
a little kid steps up but the collector lingers
if somebody draws something and then you draw the same thing right on top of it not going out side the designated original art what do call that
shrugs i dont know
to banky see
its not tracing
oh but it is
to little kid do you want lour book signed or what
hey dont get all testy with him just because you have a problem with your station in life
im secure with what i do
then say it youre a tracer
grabbing little kids book how should i sign this
grabs book back i dont want you to sign it i want the guy that draws bluntman and chronic to sign it
youre just a tracer
tell him little shaver
holden accepts a comic from another fan
off comic who do i sign it to
before holden can finish a loud crash is heard
he looks to his left and freaks
banky is throttling the collector from across the table
the collector attempts to fight him off
security guards pull them apart
holden grabs banky
all i did was call him a tracer
to collector to security guard could you get him out of here
the security guards drag the collector away
hey wait a sec
he jumped me
and youre dragging me away
exiting fucking tracer
calling oc can i explain the audience principle to you
if you insult and accost them then we have no audience
he started it
fucking cock knocker
hes lucky i didnt put my pen through his thorax
need i remind you
holds up watch curtains in ten minutes
hooper fills the frame
he comes off like a typical pro black anti white homeboy
for years in this industry whenever an african american character hero or villain was introduced usually by white artists and writers they got slapped with racist names that singled them
out as negroes black panther black lightning black goliath black mantra black talon black spider black hand black falcon black cat
beat well bust this regardless
were at a panel discussion
the room is full
five creators sit at a long table their names on placards in front of them
one of them is a very striking girl
the banner behind them reads words up minority voices in comics
holds up comic now my book white hating coon doesnt have any of that bullshit
the heros name is maleekwa and hes a descendant of the black tribe that established the first society on the planet while all you european mother fuckers were still hiding
in caves and shit all terrified of the sun
hes a strong role model that a young black reader can look up to cause im here to tell you the chickens are comin home to roost yall the black
mans no longer gonna play the minstrel in the medium of comics and sci fi fantasy
were keeping it real and were gonna get respect by any means necessary
during the speech holden and banky enter and sit up front
calling out bullshit
lando calrissian was a black man and he got to fly the millennium falcon
hooper whips his head around looking for the source of the comment who said that
standing i did
lando calrissian is a positive black role model in the realm of science fiction fantasy
fuck lando calrissian
uncle tom nigger
always some white boy gotta invoke the holy trilogy
bust this those movies are about how the white man keeps the brother man down even in a galaxy far far away
check this shit
you got cracker farm boy luke skywalker nazi poster boy blond hair blue eyes
and then youve got darth vader the blackest brother in the galaxy
whats a nubian
shut the fuck up
now vader hes a spiritual brother with the force and all that shit
then this cracker skywalker gets his hands on a light saber and the boy decides hes gonna run the fucking universe gets a whole klan of whites together and theyre
gonna bust up vaders hood the death star
now what the fuck do you call that
intergalactic civil war
theyre gonna drive our the black element to make the galaxy quote unquote safe for white folks
but vader turns out to be lukes father
and in jedi they become friends
dont make me bust a cap in your ass yo
jedis the most insulting installment because vaders beautiful black visage is sullied when he pulls off his mask to reveal a feeble crusty white man
theyre trying to tell us that deep inside we all want to be white
well isnt that true
hooper explodes he pulls a nine millimeter from his belt draws on banky and fires
banky goes down falling forward into the crowd the crowd screams and starts to scatter hooper jumps over the table and raises his fists in the air
the crowd is gone
holden sits in his chair laughing
hooper steps off the stage and picks bankys head up off the floor
breaking character whats a nubian
bitch you almost made me laugh
hooper sounds different actually he sounds gay
actually he is
well what about you
you didnt tell me you were going to scream black rage
i nearly pissed myself
how do you manage to get away with this all the time
shouldnt cops be busting your head open right about now
off gun well this right here she full of blanks okay
and opiate gets all sorts of legal clearances before i go on
your publisher condones these theatrics
honey they insist
i need to sell the image to sell the book would the audience still buy the black rage angle if they found out the book was written by a
when you say if it sounds so sexy
he kisses banky full on the lips wipes his lips hey hey
ill play your victim but not your catcher
how is it that you sound like minister farakhan when youre on stage
they turn to see
a beautiful blonde ruffled haired angel swinging her purse in a circle
her name is alyssa
shes the striking girl from the panel who didnt get to say much
and the king of pop when youre nor
look out boys this kitten has a whip
shoves and slaps him always before i get to speak
i swear the next con i attend and they ask me to be on the minority panel if i see your name anywhere near the list im passing
defending himself holden
banky this pile of p
is alyssa jones
she does that book idiosyncratic routine
this is the fourth panel weve been on together and even though she knows my publisher sets this up and pays for the event
she still gets mad when it ends with my act
i just wish i was the one who gets to shoot you
thats what my father said when i came nay leapt out of the closet off guys these boys do bluntman and chronic which outsells both of our books put together
hence theyre never on a panel with the likes of us
they slumming right now
ive read your book
chick stuff but cute
holden hits him
shoots him a look to alyssa sorry about him
hes dealing with being an inker
to banky oh
shaking her hand i really enjoy your book im surprised weve never met at any other cons before
lose the dick or change your skin tone and we can get to know each other on panel after panel while the pink black panther here plays chuck d
for the fanboys
to the boys i told alyssa id buy her a post rave drink
do the garden staters have to sprint to the lincoln tunnel or can you stay for a round in the big scary city
were gonna take off soon
banky offers holden a puzzled glance
then he nods to hooper
holden banky alyssa and hooper sir around a table drinking talking and smoking
archie and the riverdale gang were a pure and fun lovin bunch
you cant find dysfunction in those comics because they were just flat out wholesome
archie and jughead were lovers
sips his drink shut the fuck up
archie was the bitch and jughead was the butch thats why jughead wears that crown looking hat all the time he the king of queen archies world
man i feel a hate crime coming on hes got a point
archie never did settle on betty or veronica
because he wanted them both at the same time you assholes
he never chose one because he was trying to get both of them into a three way
pulls out a dollar and hands it to banky here
i want you to go down to the corner store and buy yourself a clue
i told you to watch it with that urkel shit
face it girl archies a sister
getting up to hooper thats it
you are marching back across the street with me and were going to pick up a shit load of archie books i am going to prove to you beyond the
shadow of a doubt that archie was all about pussy
sliding out of booth this boy is conflicted i shall play mother therapist for him
you two sit tight
we shall return promptly
banky and hooper exit leaving alyssa and holden alone at the table
is he always like that
for years now
started back in third grade a nun was teaching us about the blessed trinity
shes going on about the three persons in one god thing father son holy spirit and he just goes ballistic
i guess it was too big for him to grasp
they got into this huge fight
how bad could it have been
you ever seen a nun call a small child a fucking cunt rag
wasnt pretty shit like thats bound to happen when you make a kid wear a matching tie and slacks everyday
and your parochial school misadventures
limited to wine tasting prior to mass
turned me into a grade school alcoholic altar boy
i couldnt tell you how many mornings after serous benders id wake up next to strange priests
arent you the sharp wit
im just a fan of clergy molestation humor
probably why the extended family quit inviting me to first communion parties
looking oc you play darts
you know only in bars
a dart hits the board then one hits the wall beside the board
alyssa winds up with another dart
hers always hit
his never do
so your new book seems to be selling like mad
it goes back to something my grandmother told me when i was a kid
holden she said the big bucks are in dick and fart jokes
she was a church goer
uh oh the cry from the heart of a real artist trapped in commercial hell pitying his good fortune
im sure you can dry your eyes on all those fat checks you rake in
im sorry did i detect a note of bitter envy in there
im happy my stuff gets read at all
theres very little market for hearts and flowers in this spandex clad big pecs big tits big guns field
if i sell two issues i feel like john grisham
looking out window its all about marketing
over or underweight guys who dont get laid theyre our bread and butter
people like those two outside should be yours
through the window we see a couple making out on the hood of a car
and sadly there are more of our core audience out there than yours
smiles look at that though kind of gives you a little charge to see two people in love
and all over bankys car no less
that cars seeing more action right now than its seen in years
bubbly guy like that its hard to figure out why
still looking at oc couple youve gotta respect that kind of display of affection
its crazy rude self absorbed but its love
thats not love
that out there
you wanna hear about love
oh ill tell you about love
the original love story
my mothers uncle
he was a millionaire
i kid you not
all through high school he dated this one girl
they were inseparable
and when they graduated she went off to carnegie mellon
so he stays in the home town and they begin their long distance relationship
the plan is on the third sunday of every month hell train out spend a week then train back they do this for four years
that is love
not nearly finished
two months before shes going to graduate hes got this job digging graves and he comes across
a steamer trunk containing silver ingots
get out of here
many many silver ingots
now my mothers uncle being quite the ingenious chap he buries the trunk again and heads up to the main office where he proceeds to purchase a cemetery plot
guess which one
so now he owns the plot and all of its contents
two days later my mothers uncle is worth three million
at which time he marries the high school sweetheart and lives happily ever after
not even close
inside the steamer trunk stenciled into the wood or something like that is a curse
someone wrote fuck inside his new steamer trunk
not that kind of curse
a cryptic curse great fortune means great loss it said
what kind of asshole writes that inside a steamer trunk
the same kind of asshole that buries silver ingots
the day my mothers uncle is heading out to see the girl he stops at his accountants to grab some cash and winds up missing his train
so he has to take the next one which he does and he gets there an hour later than his usual time of arrival whereupon he sees lights
a heros welcome for the new millionaire
it seems that while she was standing on the platform waiting that extra hour for my mothers uncle to show up the girl was dragged into the bushes by an
unknown assailant raped and gutted
holden is silent alyssa downs her drink
the assailant was never apprehended
beat thats a love story
yes and heres why my mothers uncle rode that train every day for the rest of his life
one day up the next day back
did that till the day he died
he donated the fortune hed acquired to the train station in pittsburgh to have a well lit terminal built
the train line let him ride for free after that
i should hope so
jesus thats the saddest tale ive ever heard
thats my love story
alyssa tosses her last dart
holden seems a bit dazed
he looks out the window
those two arent on the hood of bankys car anymore
i told you it wasnt love
grabs her purse i gotta split
it was really nice meeting you
i wish you the best of luck with your book
shakes his hand tell hooper ill call him later
and tell your friend to calm down
alyssa exits to the night
holden stares after her
two beats later hooper and banky enter holding an everythings archie comic between them
archie is not fucking mister weatherbee
deny deny deny
to holden wheres alyssa
she said shed call you later
off comic hes just offering to help archie with his homework
read between the lines
shoves book at him fuck this
to holden lets go
no response from holden holden
looking out window djou see that dent in the hood of your car
looking out window what the
son of a bitch
banky runs out holden shrugs at hooper
let me guess you like her
miss alyssa jones
as long as thats all
finishes drink maybe you can convince that partner of yours to drop me off downtown before you scurry out the tunnel
beat mister weatherbee wasnt really trying to fuck archie was he
they begin exiting
weatherbee was reggies bitch
were in holden and bankys studio apartment
its a rented loft style place with high ceilings wood floors and sparse furnishings
there are posters on the walls a sort of kitchenette a hockey net a big tv
with all the trimmings vcr laserdisc player sega snes a huge comfy couch and two drawing boards with adjacent desks littered with pencils pens coloring pencils paints erasers etc
at which sit holden and banky
some music plays
of holden penciling over his shoulder we see holden sketching chronic in mid attack of his arch nemesis the giggler
holden erases a line and re draws
of banky inking over his shoulder we see banky outlining a pre penciled page
he traces bluntman swinging from a street light
the two work in silence
not looking up this is one of the best street lights youve ever drawn
its the one across from the post office
looks just like it
beat what do you wanna do tonight
get a pizza
watch degrassi junior high
erases you got a weird thing for canadian melodrama
ive got a weird thing for girls who say aboot
the phone starts ringing
holden answers it while still drawing
bank hold up
crosscut between holden and hooper
hes on a phone in a hooper here
listen i know how you burb fiends hate the city but theres a club shindig going down that i think youd get into
where is it
place called her sterectomy im tempting as bar keep

like thatll happen
let me explain something to you my witless chum the other night in that bar we two alyssa and i shared a moment alright
oh you had a moment
brings his two pointer fingers together we shared a moment
and in that moment one thing was made abundantly clear this girl loves me my friend
its a club people are mingling a band is playing its loud
but somethings fishy
hoopers tending bar
he hands a guy a drink
the guy sips it
this is so watered down
why is it you can never get a decent drink in these places
hooper looks around in a very exaggerated fashion
what are you doing
trying to find you a tissue
the guy shoots hooper an angry glare banky enters
alright bring on the free hootch
as long as you dont bitch about how little alcohol is in the drink
hands banky a drink to guy you owe me five sixty
off banky and i suppose youre going to make your friend here pay for his drink right
hey i befriended a guy in a position of authority so i could abuse that authority and get free shit
you want to do the same
theres a lonely hindu works at the ll across the street
get in tight with him
the guy angrily pulls out his money and slams it on the bar
i work at that
storms away calling after him wanna be friends
wheres your better half
taking a piss

she moves like a cat and shes looking very sexy

hooper holden and banky stare oc

holden smacks banky and moves to exit
wait wait theres something you should know
shes got a boyfriend
then whats to know
holden exits they watch him go
banky looks around
therere a lot of chicks in this place
youre such a man
beat he didnt really say that about my dick did he
on the dance floor holden slips into the crowd and dances up to alyssa
he intentionally bumps into her
fake rage dancing hey hey hey you fucked up my cabbage patch
well well well bluntman himself
or should i call you chronic
call me flattered
i heard you sent me the invite to this little soiree
from a former home town girl to mister home town himself
youre saying youre from the burbs

im from highlands
hooper told me
how is it that we never ran into one another
you graduate from hudson

so you know the tri town area
i wrote my name on the wall
lost my virginity there
this is so cool
eden prairie of menlo park

my best friend fucked a dead guy in the back room
you know that girl
before she was committed
you know what this is
this is fate
regarding her move no this is the rog
i was talking about us meeting what are the chances
i havent been back to the burbs since my friends funeral
the quick stop girl died
another friend julie dwyer
she died in the
you knew her too
one friend in an asylum the other friend in the grave
youre a dangerous person to know
but i can tap
does an impromptu tap dance that was the buffalo two step
thats what six years of tap lessons yields
two towns away from each other for years and we had to meet in new york
the sand stops playing
coulda been worse we could have not met at all
holden looks at her
the singer on stage speaks into the microphone
a long time ago we used to have this bass player who took off one day to draw funny books or something
maybe youve seen her stuff its called idiosyncratic routine the crowd applauds
alyssa shakes her head smiling
holden pokes her
but what a lot of people dont know is that she used to harbor these delusions that she could sing
and she used to subject us to these throaty renditions of debbie gibson tunes and shit insisting that we let her front on a few numbers
well we didnt and she quit
and then she got famous the bitch
crowd laughs but shes here tonight and i think if we all begged or maybe offered her some x shed get up here and treat us to some of her
crowd applauds what do you say alyssa
alyssa shakes her head no
the crowd urges her
holden pushes her forward
yelling the crowd thunders
alyssa offers the singer an embarrassed half smile
she looks at holden who claps along with the others and nods toward the stage
alyssa shakes her head and relents heading through the crowd banky and hooper stand at the bar
this is so queer
he exits beat you dont know the half of it
alyssa jumps on stage hugging the singer
she takes the mic shaking her head
the crowd is applauding
she is such a twat
the crowd cheers
she turns to the band and says something which they nod
she turns back to the crowd
i should dedicate this right
thinks this is for that special someone our there
banky joins him
holden glances at him
banky offers a mocking mimic of his smile
the band starts playing
cross cutting begins
alyssa launches into a torchy tune
the song is extremely sexy as is alyssa who works the mic making direct eye contact with
or does she
holden is smiling being seduced banky rolls his eyes
beside holden stands a pretty girl with a short haircut whos also riveted by alyssas performance
alyssa makes big time eye contact with somebody out there
the song seems to be aimed at whoever shes looking at
its more than obvious theres a seduction going on bur of whom
at the end of the song the crowd goes wild but alyssas preoccupied
she points to someone in the crowd and curls her finger back in a cmere fashion urging whoever it is to join her
she jumps off the stage
holden shakes his head sheepishly and looks downward aw shucks style
at that moment the girl beside him leaps forward
bankys eyes widen
holden looks up and is suddenly taken aback
alyssa and the girl race into each others arms and fall into a way to passionate to mean anything else kiss
holdens eyes bug
banky allows a smile to creep across his face
the crowd applauds
banky looks around and for the first time we get the distinct impression that this is a lesbian bar
there are a lot of chicks in this place
banky looks at holden and slaps him on the back
now that my friend is a
brings his fingers together mimicing holden shared moment holden continues to stare mouth agape
alyssa and the girl continue to kiss
banky holden alyssa and the girl from the dance floor sit around a table
alyssa and the girl continue to make out
holden and banky casually watch wide eyed
banky stares a little harder
holden hits him
under his breath thats rude
man when are we ever going to get a chance to see this kind of shit live without paying for it
alyssa and the girl break their kiss
uh oh better knock it off were getting a man excited
new to him
oh and youre an old hand at this
no i should apologize
i dont usually get all mushy in public
but its been awhile since ive seen kim here
formerly the girl tell me you didnt set that gross display up with the band just so you could nail me
like id have to go through that much effort you know what
i want to dance
ill watch from here
tugging at her arm no
i want to dance with you
dont be such a rag
i have to sit here and work up the desire to fuck you later
banky is smiling ear to ear
alyssa looks at him
you said fuck
to that girl
you said youd fuck her
how can a girl fuck another girl
were you talking about strap ons or something
hits him would you shut up
its a valid question
you know the dyke stuff in the penthouse letters section is written by guys this is our chance to get the inside scoop
to alyssa i dont know how many times i can apologize for him
secretly all i really want is to be the center of attention
to banky ive never used a snap on
then whats with saying fuck
shouldnt you say eat her out or at least modify the term fuck with something like fist
let me ask you a question can men fuck each other
in your estimation
so for you to fuck means to penetrate
youre used to the more traditional definition you inside some girl youve duped jack hammering away not noticing that bored look in her eyes
hey i always notice the bored look in their eyes
laughs fucking is nor limited to penetration banky
for me it describes any sex when its not totally about love
i dont love kim but ill fuck her
im sure you dont love every girl you sleep with
some of them i downright loathe
but ill bet its different with the ones you love
ill bet you go the full nine when its not just a quick fix like you go down on them longer or something
here we go
i dont do that
i stopped dropping
it got to be too frustrating
as stupid as you usually come off during this diatribe of yours youre going to come off ten times as stupid on this occasion
i lost my tolerance for the bullshit baggage that comes with eating girls out
whats the big deal
if you say the smell so help me ill slug you
not the smell the smell is good
im talking about not being able to do it property
and my mother brought me up to believe that if i cant do something right i shouldnt do it at all
of course my father told me she gave lousy head but thats beside the point
at least you blame yourself for your sexual inadequacies
no i blame them
chicks never help you out
they never tell you what to do
and most of them are self conscious about that smell factor and so most of the time they just lay there frozen like a deer in the headlights right
not for nothing but when a chick goes down on me
i let her know where to go and what the status is
you gotta handle it like cnn and the weather channel constant updates
youre such an idiot
no hes got a point
thats how i was in high school i was nervous and inhibited about being eaten out
but by the time i got to college that all changed
i loosened up
not only did i learn to communicate i learned to be bossy
i was like one of those guys at the airport with those big flash lights waving them this way directing them that way telling them when to stop
and thats all im saying itd be different if chicks helped out pointed a guy in the right direction
then thered be no bullshit no wasted time and no chance for permanent injuries
you wanna see something permanent
pulls our front tooth i got this from nina rollins sophomore year
im going down on her and out of nowhere her cat jumps on her stomach
she does this big ol pelvic thrust cracks my tooth in half sends it down my throat
i had to get a crown for the stub
to holden i got that beat
to banky i got that beat
half turns and lifts chin sophomore year
im going down on cynthia slater in her dorm room after we went club hopping
im totally drunk and in the middle of it i fall asleep right there in her lap
she got so mad she digs her heel into my back right there
points to scar thats permanent
you see this
moves neck slightly right thats the farthest i can move my neck to the right sophomore year im going out with maria bennert and for six months im going down
on her and not a damn things happening
then one night i change a position or vary my lapping speed and suddenly its a whole new world
shes moving around convulsing breathing heavy
and her legs are pressing against my ears so tightly that i dont hear her father come into the room
he grabs my hair
grabs his own hair and pulls back and he pulls me way back hard
throws up her leg and rolls up pants senior year
im eating our missy kurt in her brothers car
shes laying across the back seat and im half hanging out of the car my knees on the ground
shes flailing around and she knocks the parking brake off
the car starts rolling down the hill and my right knee is cut up all to shit like a kiddys scissor class cut it up for paper dolls
banky and alyssa laugh
holden looks at a small scar on his arm and thinks better about mentioning it
then kim re enters and plants a big kiss on alyssas neck
off bankys watch holy shit is that the time
weve gotta beat traffic
what traffic its one thirty in the morning
getting up and rush hour starts in six hours
to alyssa thanks for inviting us out
alyssa waves at him as he exits
banky slides out of the booth
to kim since you like chicks right
do you just look at yourself in the mirror all the time
holden reaches in and pulls banky out
alyssa watches them go then turns and kisses kim
holden looks preoccupied
banky flips through magazines biting off mini pieces of the gum hes chewing
he sticks them between pages presses the mag closed picks up another one and then repeats the whole process
a receptionist types
off holdens look youre still dwelling on the dyke arent you
lower your voice
whatd i tell you she just needs the right guy
all every woman really wants be it mother senator nun is some serious deep dicking
the receptionist stops typing and looks at banky shocked
off her look dont give me that look i heard adam curry say worse
the secretary goes back to typing
banky shrugs at holden
thats why i cant buy lesbians
everyone needs dick
see i can buy fags
bunch of guys that need dick just plain need it
that i get
but live and let live i guess
im sure the gay community appreciates your support
john sloss the boys lawyer joins them
please tell me you havent blown this deal already
sloss like a mother fucker
slaps his hand hey every mother but yours a shysters gotta have his standards
the execs are a casual couple of guys sitting on couches across from our trio
we just want to start off by saying that its a pleasure to finally meet you
while its been shall we say an experience dealing with sloss here one of the main reasons we started this whole thing was to meet the guys that do bluntman
points at them snootchie bootchies
the execs and sloss laugh
holden and banky politely join in
banky shoots holden a these guys are idiots look
which brings us to our proposal we are extremely interested in doing twelve half hour bluntman and chronic cartoons
the age of beavis is coming to a close and were looking for something
even more retarded and juvenile to sate the voracious intellectually challenged miscreants that make up your key demographic
the execs laugh hard
sloss secretly shrugs to banky and gives the thumbs up
composes himself so what do you say
are we in business
banky leans back into the couch wearing a thoughtful face
he looks to holden then to sloss
sloss nods in understanding
jim sean could we have a few minutes
looks to exec uh
wait outside the execs smile and head our closing the door behind then
sloss turns to banky
did i do good
you did better you sold us out
they clasp hands and quietly explode in ebullience
do you know how much youll make on merchandising alone
as simon bar sinister money and power and money and power
joins in money dnd power and money and
interrupting i dont think its a good idea
banky and sloss freeze
they stare at holden
whats not a good idea
please dont say the cartoon please dont say the cartoon
are you out of your fucking mind
getting up john let me handle this
to holden you are out of your fucking mind arent you
is this how you want to be remembered
as the guy who created bluntman and chronic
banky sits at the execs desk and starts rifling through the guys stuff
no id like to be remembered as the filthy rich guy who created bluntman and chronic
but itll be all glossy and main stream
well lose any artistic credibility we ever had
to banky is it me
i dont see the problem
to sloss he just has to get over this crush of his
oh god not on carrie fisher again
to holden holden shes not really a princess
opening drawer with a letter opener not on her on alyssa jones the chick that does that comic book idiosyncratic routine
you ever seen it
like i even read your comic let alone anyone elses to holden im not limited to offering you legal counsel only my friend
im also learned in the ways of the heart and can offer you this advice nail her get it out of your system and move on
like we say at sloss law good fences make good neighbors
shed never let him in her yard
the chicks gay
laughing shes gay
you fell for a gay comic book writing chick
holden you poor poor man
beat wait a sec does she have representation
always working you
holds up a polaroid of a naked woman look at this mrs
m tv exec has a string of pearls hanging our of her ass would you leave his stuff alone
to holden you can break her resolve killer
all it takes is one good man
but if it takes two good men dont hesitate to call me
that being said in regards to the more pressing issue i suggest you leave art to the museums and grab on with both hands to the big fat check
ill give it some thought holding up polaroid im taking this as a precaution just in case they give us any shit about pussys decision delay
glaring at holden youll give it some thought
youre so retarded im retarded
this from the guy who only forty five minutes ago paid fifty bucks for whats supposed to be a boot leg of march of the wooden soldiers with a deleted
scene of stan laurel wearing a french tickler
howd you fall for that
the guy who sold it to me had an honest face
there is a door
theres a knock at the door
holden opens it and alyssa is standing there
somebody told me that they make comic books here and ive got an idea for this story about a guy who comes to a club and high tails it when
he finds out this girl is pay
any interest in a story like that
alyssa and holden walk through the park eating hot dogs
thats great isnt it
banky seems to think so
but you dont
they come to a swing set and sit down on the swings
i dont know if thats the perception i want people to have of our stuff
i know this sounds pretentious as hell but i like to think of us as artists
and id like to get back to doing something more personal like our first book
well when are you going to do that
beat as soon as we have something personal to say
do you know how pretty you are
youre a pretty man
i get it
im into girls so i have to find all men repulsive or something
i didnt say anything
arent there some men that you find attractive
granted not enough to sleep with but still just handsome or something
and our mail man
well its the same thing
i look at you and just find you really handsome
and you know it has very little to do with your look per se
your look is fine dont get me wrong
but its more your outlook
the things you say the way you see things
i dont know
attractive holden looks away embarrassed i weirded you our the other night huh
no not really
beat its just that weve
i mean ive never seen that kind of thing up close and personal
it just took awhile to process longer than usual
do you want to talk about it
if you want to
i like you
i havent liked a man in a long time
and im not a man hater or something
its just been some time since ive been exposed to a man that didnt immediately live into a stereotype of some sort
and i want you to feel comfortable with me because i want us to be friends
so if there are things youd like to know its okay to ask me
beat why girls
beat why men
because thats the standard if thats the only reason youre attracted to women because its the standard
its more than that
so youve never been curious about men
curious about men
i always wondered why my father watched hee haw
you know what i mean
girls feel right
and thats how i feel
ive never really been attracted to men
im more comfortable with the idea of girls
wait wait wait youre still a virgin
but youve only been with girls
youre saying a persons a virgin until theyve had intercourse with a member of the opposite sex
isnt that the standard definition
again with the standards
i think virginity is lost when you make love for the first time
with a member of the opposite sex
why only then
because thats the standard
so if a virgin is raped then shes still a virgin
of course not
but rape is not the standard
so shes had sex but not the standard idea of sex
hence according to your definition shed still be a virgin
okay ill revise
virginity is lost when the hymen is broken
then i lost my virginity at ten because i fell on a fence post when i was ten and it broke my hymen
now i have to tell people that i lost it to a wooden post id known my whole young life
second revision virginity is lost through penetration
physical penetration or emotional
well i fell in love hard with caitlin bree when we were in high school
we had sex
yeah but not real sex
i move to have that remark stricken from the record
on account of it makes you come off as completely naive and infantile
well wheres the penetration in lesbian sex
alyssa holds up her hand
ive had my finger in my ass but i wouldnt say ive had anal sex
did i hold up a finger
waves her hand beat then he gets it youre kidding
she nods how
our bodies are built to pass a child for christs sake
but doesnt it hurt
but in a good way
and its only a once in awhile thing reserved for really special occasions
what about not so special occasions
but how can that be enough
i mean lets be real how big can a tongue even get
alyssa swallows what shes chewing and releases her tongue which is just huge
holden is transfixed
alyssa wraps it back up and smiles standing
holden remains in the swing
alyssa comes back in
just give me a moment
banky tries to balance way too much luggage
look at you
its a two day trip
i got the sega in one bag my clothes in the other and two months worth of unread comics in this one
were going to a convention for the love of god
well be busy from ten till eight each day
when are you possibly going to have time for any of that shit
in fact fuck it youre leaving some of this shit here in a locker
come on give me the two that arent clothes
starts rifling through one bag what are you doing
i just have to get something
pulls out a huge stack of porno books who are you larry fucking flynt
what are you going to do with all of those
read the articles
what do you think im going to do with them
theyre stroke books
youve got like thirty books there
were only there for two days
leafing through mags varietys the spice of life
i like a wide selection
sometimes im in the mood for nasty close ups sometimes i like them arty and air brushed
some times its a spread brown eye kind of night sometimes its girl on girl time
sometimes a steamy letter will do it sometimes not often but sometimes i like the idea of a chick with a horse
a beeping sound is heard
holden checks his beeper
go check us in
ive gotta call alyssa
his masters voice
put that stuff away
banky starts packing his mags up
a little kid enters staring at him
what are those
looks at kid then books do you like horsies
holden finishes dialing the phone
cross cut between him and alyssa at home
i hope for the sake of the women youve dated that youre only this quick in returning calls
im about to get on a plane
last minute invite to the dragon con
my sisters at my parents
i was gonna go see her
the one that wrote the book
but i was staying all weekend and i wanted to hang our with you
you didnt get invited to the con
i dont do southern cons all the chicks have that annoying drawl
you know how hard it is nor to laugh when someone moans fuhhk me
well this sucks
thinks you know both of us dont have to go
banky can go by himself
its not like were on a panel
it was just a signing appearance
if you come pick me up ill be your best friend
beat wheres your apartment
im not there
im at a friends in the village
corner of houston and mercer
number eighty six apartment ill be there in half an hour
youre so easy
they hang up
holden reacts to something oc and exits quickly
banky points to pictures in the book
the kid looks on
and then black beauty couldnt take it any longer and he finally did some of his own mounting
off book wow
holden grabs bankys arm and drags him away
what are you doing
waving to kid i think i want kids of my own one day
listen to me im not going
youre going to have to do this one by yourself
alyssas coming down for the weekend so i want to hang out with her
you dont need me for this
taking his excess baggage meantime ill take this stuff home
you can keep the filth
ill pick you up at nine sunday night alright
dont forget to plug the annual and dont mention the t
call me if you get bored
and hes gone
banky stands there open mouthed
a check in flight attendant comes up to him
his name tag reads frank
checking in sir
still watching holden go hunhh
looks at f
but this is carry on
federal aviation security law requires me to ask if youve been given any strange gifts or parcels to carry on since arriving at the airport today
thinks not this trip
but one time when i was using curb side check in this sky cap gave me a cock ring and a set of anal ben wa balls
i always thought that was pretty strange
he said his name was frank
looks closely at him hey
youre names frank
banky storms away
the flight attendant watches him go
holden knocks at the door
a woman is standing in the doorway in her bra she looks holden up and down and smirks
let me guess the right man
youve got it in your head that alyssas not really into chicks that she just hasnt met the right man
and you believe youre it
youre going to treat her right fuck her like a stud and straight jacket her back from the land of the lost
and the sad truth is that youll accomplish none of that and wind up as either an even more bitter misogynist or a reverse fag hag
holdens at a loss
alyssa slips past the woman carrying an overnight bag
dont mind her
thats just her way a saying hello
actually its just my way of saying give it up
to woman youre such an asshole
when you file the date rape charges dont say i didnt warn you
holding out hand im holden by the way
im the voice of reason that miss bitch is having such a hard time listening to
look were just friends
thats what every guy says before he tries purring your hand on his dick
and how do you know men so well
because i lapdance for a living dick head
she slams the door
holden looks to alyssa
ohhh you look so cute
she heads down the stairs
who was that
just an occasional friend
why would you want to hang our with someone bitter as that
stops remember this
sticks out huge tongue hers is even bigger than that
she smiles and continues on
holden looks back up at the door
he sticks his own tongue our and sizes it with his fingers
the car sits in traffic
alyssa plays with the radio
you were raised catholic right
did you have a strict upbringing
please there was no time to be bad we were too busy saying jesus
you think your upbringing had something to do with your lifestyle choice
somewhere along the line
its a gradual transition to make from doing what the majority does to taking a leap of faith and doing what feels more natural
everything helps from the way you were handled as a kid to the way the boys acted in third grade to the shoes you wore at your freshman prom
well they were really tight
with the requisite music over which we hear a conversation between holden and alyssa
holden and alyssa sit in the diner eating
the waitress walks past and drops her pad
she bends over to pick it up hiking her mini skirt up in the process
alyssa stares at her ass
holden stops talking and stares at her
alyssa looks over at him and offers a caught smile
holden pushes a shopping cart at the food store throwing various things into the basket
alyssa comes up with a box of tampons and throws them in
holden glances at them a bit flushed
alyssa catches him picks up the box and pulls one out
she proceeds to demonstrate their usage throwing one leg on the can and miming insertion
holden puts up his hands in the i know i know fashion
in the studio holden displays some of his artwork to alyssa during which she pulls out a cigarette and goes to light it
its a child proof lighter so shes having trouble
holden grows a little frustrated
finally he grabs the lighter and pulls the child proof tab out with his teeth
alyssa stares at him a bit taken aback
holden spits the tab out and lights alyssas smoke
he then continues with his display
holden and alyssa at the comic book store
steve dave and the fan boy eye them suspiciously
alyssa pays for a comic
steve dave glowers at holden
he gives alyssa her change and they exit
steve dave goes back to his card game with the fan boy
suddenly a garbage can comes crashing through their window
steve dave rips a check off the garbage can and punches the counter
the fan boy rubs his back soothingly holden and alyssa walk through a parking lot talking
she takes his hand and pulls his arm around her shoulder
holden smiles to himself
let me ask you something we get along right
we have a definite chemistry
so it would seem
but were both into girls
im into women
but you werent always gay
when i was nine i had a crush on scott baio
so if wed met a long time ago say in high school
id still be muff diving yes
holden and banky play ea sports hockey on sega
theres a knock at the door
alyssa enters and stands besides them smiling at their game
i read somewhere that guys who play hockey are merely making up for penile deficiencies by carrying big sticks
i thought you lived in the city
this is like the umpteenth time ive seen you here
isnt that grounds enough for the little pink mafia to throw you out of their club
hits banky to alyssa ill be ready in a second
i just have to school this mouthy second stringer
bitch youre schooling no one
cut back and forth between the game and banky holden and alyssa
off game what
off game you fucking cock teaser
ill knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass
look at how slow you are
christ you move like a geriatric
screaming at screen fuck
you fucking cock sucker man
these faggots wont do what i tell them to
its the controller right
its always the controller
no its these
fucking queers on blades that cant accept a fucking pass to save their lives
what period is this
final sixty of the third
look at your fucking guys they
whips controller banky storms away
alyssa looks at holden imagine if id only beaten him by one instead of thirty
holden feeds a couple dollars into the change machine
alyssa looks on
explain this again
how could you have grown up down the shore and never played skee ball
what did you do with your youth
they head toward the skee ball runs
stayed out late smoked pot screwed around
not your grade school years your high school years
off skee ball run this looks complicated
inserts coin and pulls lever the premise is very basic you roll the ball up the ramp at varying speeds in an effort to pop it into the score circles
the higher the score the more prize tickets you get
what do you do with the prize tickets
trade them in for prizes that arent worth nearly as much as you paid to play the game
then whats the point
and you question my lifestyle
holden rolls the ball
it pops into a twenty point circle
its just that simple
why not just walk up there and put it in the fifty every time
wheres the skill in that
oh this is a skill
im sorry i had no idea
just toss one
alyssa picks up a ball squints to aim and whips it overhand
it pops off one of the circles and shoots back at them missing them as they duck
an oc knock and an ow
holden reacts as alyssa laughs
to oc guy im sorry man
shes new at this
holden ducks as the ball comes sailing back at his head
he gets up
to oc thank you
hands alyssa another ball underhand
throw it underhand
this is where you take straight chicks on dates
its like spanish fly
thisll probably be the first time i dont score afterwards
i dont know
im starting to get a tingle in my bottom
tosses a ball ten
grabs a ball so whatd you do last night
prepares to throw got laid holden whips the ball in surprise
it ricochets off the ceiling and through the glass of an old pinball machine
holden looks around nervously
some more of that skill you were telling me about
maybe we should just leave before somebody gets hurt
i want a cheap prize
throws a ball so your friends quite the homophobe
he just feels left out i think
im not talking about his infantile hang up with me
im talking about when you two were playing that game
everytime he swore when his players messed up he called them cocksuckers he referred to the players as queers he called you a cock teaser
i thought he was talking to you
i know you think it means nothing and it may in fact be unintentional but its ugly all the same
he was just pissed he was losing
so he slams the gay community
dont get all p
but what is that saying
it says he gets too easily frustrated
its passive agressive gay bashing
how do you figure
how casually did it roll off his tongue
and thats how he expresses his anger
by calling people faggots
i think youre reading too much into it
i think youre just so used to it that it rolls off your back
ive heard the two of you play your little rank out game where one insists the other is gay
as the boys youre a faggot
no youre a faggot
its cute and all to watch you go at it like grade schooler but its also offensive labeling and ducking the label of being gay as if it were the
scarlet fucking letter
youre blowing this way out of proportion
we live in a more tolerant age now
you refer to yourself as a dyke
hooper calls himself a faggot all the time
yeah but thats whats known as empowerment disempowerment
i call myself a dyke so its not too devastating when some throwback screams it at me as im leaving a bar at night
same for hooper by calling himself a faggot he steals the thunder away from the mouthy jerks of this world whod like to beat him to it
but the difference between us having it and your friend saying it is miles wide
we say it to mask the pain you say it for lack of a better expression at any given moment
no holden we do not live in a more tolerant age
and if you think thats the case then youve been in the suburbs way too long to be resuscitated
holden kind of sulks
but you know what
picks up his face i have more faith in you than that
rips her tickets off come on i want my cheap prize
bankys still playing sega
holden sits next to him
off screen how bad do you suck
how was your pseudo date
leave it alone
that chick bugs me
rubs his head in baby talk aww
everyone bugs you
off game fucking faggot
did you see that
your dyke courting ass just got me scored on
beat you know you should watch that
if youre going to get all bent out of shape while playing the game so much so that you need to curse the t
try not to gay bash it alright
youre nor that kind of guy
gets up and dont call her a dyke alright
shes a lesbian
holden goes to his drawing table and takes off his coat
banky sits there shocked
he puts the controller down and crosses to the drawing table
what the fuck is going on here
pulling out pencil im starting a new page
smacking pencil away not with this shit
what the fuck is going on with you and that girl
shes programming you
i beg your pardon
and apparently you dont even realize it
what does it matter if i refer to her as a dyke or if i call the whalers a bunch of faggots in the privacy of my own office far
from the sensitive ears of the rest of the world
its passive aggressive gay bashing and i know youre not really prejudiced at heart
you should just find some other way to express your anger is all im saying
holden starts drawing
banky stares at him
then he grabs the pencil out of holdens hand and shoves him to the side
he starts drawing something
what the fuck are you doing
bear with me here
i just want to put you through this little exercise
drawing feverishly okay now see this
this is a four way road okay
banky draws a four way stop
he illustrates according to his voice over
and dead in the center is a crisp new hundred dollar bill
now at the end of each of the streets are four people okay
up here we got a male affectionate easy to get along with no political agenda lesbian
now down here we have a man hating angry as fuck agenda of rage bitter dyke
to this side we got santa claus right
and over to this side the easter bunny
banky finishes drawing
holdens shaking his head which ones going to get to the hundred dollar bill first
what is this supposed to prove
this is a serious exercise
its like an s
which ones going to get to the hundred dollar bill first the male friendly lesbian the man hating dyke santa claus or the easter bunny
beat then pissed the man hating dyke
i dont know
wildly crossing out the other three holden storms away
i dont need this
im going home
shes fucking with your mind man
she knows youve got this schoolboy crush and shes using it to sway your way of thinking
and why would she need to do that
what is she mata fucking hari
what does she gain
maybe she thinks youll get her comic picked up by contender
or maybe she thinks youll change the content of our book to something more political and message oriented
or gee i dont know maybe because thats just what dykes like to do fuck around with straight guys heads just so she can go back to her little rug
muncher club and have a good laugh with all her man hating harpy cronies about how fucking stupid and easily duped men are
youre so out of line right now
you dont even know this girl
big deal shes from middletown and she went to north
all the girls at north were bitches and sluts anyway
and this ones got them beat by a mile because shes a bitch slut dyke
watch your fucking mouth is all im going to tell you
do you get my back when she bashes me
because i know she does
and do you know why she does
because i wont play her fucking game
sometimes your paranoia and suspicious bullshit is amusing
sometimes its just fucking annoying as piss
what is it about this girl
you know you have no shot at getting her into bed
why do you bother wasting time with her
because youre holden fucking mcneil most persistent traveller on the road thats not the path of least resistance
everythings gotta be a fucking challenge for you and this little relationship with that bitch is a prime example of your fucking condition
well i dont need a fucking magic eight ball to look into your future you want a forecast
here will holden ever fuck alyssa
shakes and looks at imaginary ball what a shock not fucking likely
this relationship of yours is affecting you our work and our friendship and the times going to come when i throw down the gauntlet and say its me or her
and then whatre you going to say
beat i think you should let this one go
no what would you say
would you trash twenty years of friendship because youve got some idiotic notion that this chick would even let you sniff her panties let alone fuck her
let it go
what the fuck
what the fuck makes holden looks at banky for a long beat
im in love with her man
banky stares at him
holden stares back
banky looks into holdens eyes
suddenly he softens a bit
he drops his head
banky walks away
holden watches him go and exits
holden and alyssa sit at a booth
alyssa picks through her food
holden looks at the check and pulls money from his wallet
i wish you were the one being pursued by m tv
then you could sell our and maybe pick up the check once in awhile
drops her fork and wipes her hands were leaving
well its not like this is a bed and breakfast ive got a little business to conduct
she grabs her bag and slides out of the booth
holden watches her then follows
alyssa slides up to the cashiers desk as does holden who offers a puzzled shrug
alyssa offers the just wait finger
the cashier turns to her
are you an authorized deal maker in this establishment
do you have the power to negotiate
you wanna haggle over the price of your french dip
i want to haggle over the price of fine art
what do you mean
pointing oc there
by the kitchen
what about it
the price tag says seventy five
to alyssa tell me youre kidding
ill give you fifty
to oc manuel
bring me the dyksiezski off the wall
to alyssa all my years in the diner business ive waited for this day the day when someone wanted to buy one of the pictures
holds out hand alyssa jones
pleased to meet you
you say you want to haggle but you dont know rule one about haggling which you just broke you never give your name
the name is power and to give the opponent that piece of you is to give away victory
im only trying to conduct a transaction
were not opponents
accepting painting from oh but we are if you think im letting this beautiful piece go for fifty
to holden now were haggling
its drizzling outside
alyssa hugs her painting and pushes her bare feet against the windshield making footprints
ive always wondered what kind of people buy those things
i cant believe you talked him down to twenty five
it was looking shakey when he told me the artist was a blind cripple with a hump back but i held my ground
theres no room for sympathy in the buyers market
where are you going to hang it
you want me to hang it for you
you better hope it doesnt get out to the girl nation that you needed a man to help you hang a picture
youre going to hang it in your house
i bought it for you
laughs yeah right
looks at him im serious
holden stares at her
because its captured the moment
itll be a constant reminder not just of tonight but of our introduction the building of our friendship everything
make no mistake about it my friend its a gift to you from me so youll always remember us
holden stares ahead
then he swerves the wheel to the right
the car pulls to the side of the road
the rain is a bit heavier now
holden throws the car into park why are we stopping
because i cant take it
cant take what
i love you
beat you love me
i love you
and not in a friendly way although i think were great friends
and not in a misplaced affection puppy dog way although im sure thats what youll call it
and its not because youre unattainable
i love you
very simple very truly
youre the epitome of every attribute and quality ive ever looked for in another person
i know you think of me as just a friend and crossing that line is the furthest thing from an option youd ever consider
but i cant do this any longer
i cant stand next to you without wanting to hold you
i cant look into your eyes without feeling that longing you only read about in trashy romance novels
i cant talk to you without wanting to express my love for everything you are
i know this will probably queer our friendship no pun intended but i had to say it because ive never felt this before and i like who i am because
and if bringing it to light means we cant hang out anymore then that hurts me
but i couldnt allow another day to go by without getting it out there regardless of the outcome which by the look on your face is to be the inevitable
and ill accept that but i know some part of you is hesitating for a moment and if there is a moment of hesitation that means you feel something too
all i ask is that you not suppress that at least for ten minutes and try to dwell in it before you dismiss it
there isnt another soul on this fucking planet whos ever made me the person i am when im with you and i would risk this friendship for the chance to
take it to the next plateau
because its there between you and me
you cant deny that
and even if we never speak again after tonight please know that im forever changed because of you and what youve meant to me which while i do appreciate it
id never need a painting of birds bought at a diner to remind me of
holden stares at alyssa
she stares back
then she gets out of the car
was it something i said
holden gets out of the car
its raining pretty hard now
alyssas hitching up the road
holden reaches her
what are you doing
get back in the car and get out of here
youre going to hitch to new york
arent you at least going to comment
heres my comment fuck you
that was so unfair
you know how unfair that was
its unfair that im in love with you
no its unfortunate that youre in love with me
its unfair that you felt the fucking need to unburden your soul about it
do you remember for a fucking second who i am
oh its that simple
you fall in love with me and want a romantic relationship nothing changes for you with the exception of feeling hunky dorey all the time
but what about me
its not that simple is it
i cant just get into a relationship with you without throwing my whole fucking world into upheaval
but thats every relationship
theres always going to be a period of adjustment
period of adjustment
hitting him if this is a crush
then i dont know if i could take the real thing if it ever happens
she looks at him rain drenching the pair
she shakes her head ruefully
go home holden
she walks away
holden stands there at a loss
then he turns and heads back to his car
as he reaches the door and turns to look back at her alyssa pounces on him grabs his face and locks lips with him big time
he drops his keys and embraces her
and there they stand by the side of the road drenched kissing
banky carries a bag in one arm and pulls out his keys with the other
he jams them into the lock opening the door
he picks up the mail on the floor
he closes the door behind him and shuffles to the kitchenette passing by the blanket covered slumbering forms of holden and alyssa who are out cold in each others arms
the place looks a mess like a couple of people were engaged in some tremendous fucking
banky is oblivious
he sets the bag down on the counter and pulls out a chocolate milk
he opens it sticks a straw into the top and begins sipping and sifting through the mail
he comes to mail thats holdens and tosses it onto the couch near holdens head
he looks down at the sleeping couple then back at the mail for a couple of beats
then he freezes
he looks down again and drops his jaw and his carton of choco
it hits the floor with a pop
holden and alyssa shoot straight up eyes struggling to focus
they look at one another then at the flabbergasted banky
then he shuffles toward the door again and lets himself out
off holdens reaction i take it thats not good
getting up stay here
he kisses her and exits banky sits on a curb staring into the distance holden saunters up and sits beside him
he follows bankys gaze
catholic school girls
across the street the catholic high school is letting out
teenage girls clad in uniforms and tight sweaters smoke frolic wait for their bus
the uniform is what does it for me
i wish id have went with more catholic school girls when i was a kid
as it stands
i have no
and then she unzipped her jumper
you looked weirded out back there
thats my couch you were fucking on
i wanted to watch some tv
hard to do when your best friends wrapped around a naked rug muncher on your couch
she had boxers on
banky shoots him a glare
he goes back to staring at the oc girls
this is all going to end badly
you dont know that
i know you
youre way too conservative for that girl
shes been around and seen things weve only read about in books
but we have read about them
so were prepared
theres no we here
youre going to have to go through this alone
and its one thing to read about shit and something different when youre forced to deal with it on a regular basis
when you guys are walking in the mall and both your heads turn at a really nice looking chick its going to eat you up inside
youll spend most of your time wondering when the other shoes going to drop
because for you this isnt about cool weird sex stuff its about love
maybe it is for her as well
somehow i doubt it
everyones not out to get someone in life
everybody has an agenda
my agenda is to watch your back
to what end
to insure that all this time weve spent together building something wasnt wasted
shes not going to ruin the comic
i wasnt talking about the comic
gets up im going to gel a bagel
clean off my fucking couch so i can watch tv
banky walks away
holden shakes his head
an all girl gathering
nica dalia and jane help alyssa finish an issue of idiosyncratic routine
tory letters a page
nica and dalia lay out the artwork
dalia drinks wine
alyssa paints the cover
from what i understand when you sign with a publisher someone else does all this work for you and you just sit back and collect
and miss these last minute cram sessions with my nearest and dearest
i dont know what shes bitching about
all shes done since we got here is pound merlot
im sorry werent you the one who misspelled receipt on page eighteen
yeah youre a real help
what id like to know is why were here at all when we havent seen princess funny book in a month
yeah alyssa whove you been shacking up with
stops painting smiles wide im so in love
alyssa buries her face giggling
i know i feel like such a goon
but i cant help it we have such a great time together
who is it
dont even tell me its ms
thing from the c
ill kill you
its not her
its someone you guys dont know
that chick you left the restaurant with that night
from around here
dont even tell me you met her down the shore
not a bridge and tunnel jersey dyke
with huge hair and acid washed jeans
they all cackle
alyssa tries to laugh with them
come on alyss hoboken hussy or what
for your information they dont have big hair or wear acid wash
goes back to painting theyre from my home town
dalia stares at alyssa suspiciously
why are you playing the pronoun game
what are you talking about
im not even
i met someone
we have a great time
theyre from my home town
doesnt this tube of wonderful have a name
all four girls stare at alyssa a bit horrified
she stops painting
oh alyssa no
youre dating a guy
hes not like a typical man
hes really sweet to me and we relate so well
you guysd love him really
they stare at alyssa
then dalia gets up
ive gotta go to the store
ill go with
alyssa looks to tory and nica
pouring wine whelp heres to both of you
moves the glass to her lips another one bites the dust
holden and alyssa lie in each others arms moonlight bathing them
can i ask you something
dont even tell me you want to do it again
why me you know
because you were giving me that look and i got wet
you know what im talking about
why not you
im a guy
youre attracted to girls
i see youve been taking notes
historically yes thats true
then why this
ive given that a lot of thought you know
i mean now that im being ostracized by my friends ive had a lot of time to think about all of this
and what ive come up with is really simple i came to this on my terms
i didnt just heed what i was taught you know
men and women should be together its the natural way that kind of thing
im not with you because of what family society life tried to instill in me from day one
the way the world is how seldom you meet that one person who gets you
its so rare
my parents didnt really have it
there was no example set for me in the world of male female relation ships
and to cut oneself off from finding that person to immediately half your options by eliminating the possibility of finding that one person within your own gender
that just seemed stupid
so i didnt
and by leaving my options open i was branded gay which to me was no big deal labels are labels you know
they define what you do not who you are i guess
but then you come along
you the one least likely i mean you were a guy
and while i was falling for you i put a ceiling on that because you were a guy
until i remembered why i opened the door to women in the first place to not limit the likelihood of finding that one person whod compliment me so completely
and so here we are i was thorough when i looked for you and i feel justified lying in your arms because i got here on my terms and have
no question that there was someplace i didnt look
and that makes all the difference
well you took the luster our of it
joking in case you didnt get it of how i brought you back from the other side
how all you needed was the right man to turn you around
youre not the right man
kisses him youre just the one
she snuggles into him and closes her eyes
holden stares at the ceiling
can i at least cell people that all you needed was some serious deep dicking
she hits him with her pillow
in holdens apartment alyssa waves in various directions shaking her head accordingly
then she puts up her hands to stop
cut to holden hanging the picture
alyssa gave him
it hangs at a severely crooked angle
he looks back to her and shakes his head no
holden and alyssa try to play a video game
banky plays as well
holden instructs her in the ways of nhl turning her paddle right side up pointing at things on the screen
she presses the reset button over and over
banky gives holden a what the fuck
alyssa sticks her tongue at him
at the video store holden picks up a disney cartoon off the shelf
he goes to show if to alyssa whos reading the back of anything but dick an allchick porno
an old woman stares at her
holden nods to the old woman and takes the tape out of alyssas hands putting it back on the shelf
he ushers her away
the old woman waits until theyre gone and then picks up the tape herself holden carries alyssa on his shoulders through the park her crotch against the back of his
she taps him and he stops and looks up
she begins to maneuver around so her crotch is in his face
he pulls her off and put her down
hes flushed with embarrassment
the same old woman from the video store passes by with her husband
in holdens apartment again alyssa again with the waving then putting up her hands to stop
cut to holden again this time with the painting hung completely upside down
he looks at it then offers her a bewildered gaze
in the office banky comes to his drawing table
there are penciled pages on it with a note that says hanging out with alyssa today
banky crumples it up and throws it across the room
in holdens apartment alyssa waves this way then that way then puts up her hands frantically to stop
she settles back against the wall a satisfied smile crawling across her face and closes her eyes
we pull back to reveal holden on his knees in front of her eating her out no we dont see anything
a book is thrown in front of him
he looks up
banky stands there
check out page forty eight
holden looks down at that book
its the nineteen eighty eight yearbook from middletown north
he shakes his head at banky and flips it open
on the page is alyssas senior year photo
under her name is another name in quotes that says finger cuffs
looking up so
did you see the nickname
she had a weird nick name
whats your point
do you know why its finger cuffs
i suppose you do
takes a seat you remember cohee lundin
left hudson and went to north our senior year
well i ran into him at food city the other day and we got to talking and i mentioned that you were dating alyssa and he said
cut to cohee lundon
in the parking lot of food city addressing the camera
i know alyssa jones
i mean i know alyssa jones you know what im saying
me and rick derris used to hang our with her for awhile right
just hanging around her house after school cuz her parents were like never home and shit
and one day rick just whips it out and starts rubbing it on her leg and shit chasing her around the living room i was dying
but you know what the crazy bitch did
she fucking drops to her knees and just starts sucking him off right in front of me
like i wasnt even there man
i almost died
but thats not the fucked up part the fucked up part was rick man right in the middle of it he turns to me and hes pointing at her and
he says cohee
just like that cohee
so im like ill give it a shot
and i start pulling her pants down all slow cuz i figure any second shes gonna turn around and belt me in the mouth right
but yo check this shit out shes all into it man
she dont try to stop me or nothing
shes all wet and shit and i just went to work know what im saying
me and rick are going to town on this crazy bitch and shes just loving it all moaning and shit
it was fucked up
so ricks the one that came up with the nickname cuz that day she had us locked in tight from both sides like a pair of goddamn chinese finger cuffs
back in the office holden stares at banky
hes full of shit
cohees a lot of things but an exxagerator hes not
the dudes catholic
shes never even been with a guy
thats what she says
but i say her on her hands and knees getting filled out like an application constitutes being with a guy
hes pulling your chain
and the fact that you even bought it for a second makes you look like an idiot
im getting your back asshole
people dont forget shit like finger cuffs
and if it got out that shes queer as well how do you think its going to make you look
i give a shit what people think
alright forget about that what if shes carrying a disease
that was just one story what if theres more
grabs his coat youre such a fucking asshole
oh its not possible that shes all crudded up
cohee i can vouch for as clean the dude never got laid in high school
but derris is an arch fucking bush man
name me one chick in our senior class that rick derris didnt nail for christs sake
would you let this go
im telling you shes never even been with a guy let alone those two zeroes
and im telling you the bitch could be a bigger fucking germ farm than that monkey in outbreak
holden grabs banky and pins him against the wall
give it a rest
do you hear me
im tired of this shit
shes my goddamn girlfriend do you understand
show her a little fucking respect
and if you ever even so much as mention that alyssa looks a little peaked from now on ill put your fucking teeth down your throat
he releases banky
banky brushes himself off
maybe ill put your fucking teeth down your throat
walking out not bloody likely
banky runs to the open door
calling after him ive been working out you know
no response you better be ready to make that m tv deal
the downstairs door slams
banky makes a muscle then feels it
holden and hooper peruse laser discs
wheres that bitch partner of yours been
hes having a real problem with this alyssa thing
i think its more like bankys having a problem with all things not hetero right about now
and im just another paradigm of said aberration
banky does not hate gays you know that
but i do think he is a bit homophobic
and this latest episode between you and ms
thing has tapped into that
in his warped perception he lost you to the dark side which is she
you make it sound like me and him were dating
dont kid yourself that boy loves you in a way that hes not ready to deal with
beat hes been digging up dirt on alyssa
and just what has mister angela lansbury uncovered about your lady fair
he heard some bullshit story that she took on two guys
well then hes barking up the wrong we if he wants to split you up isnt he
hes not going to make you see the error of your ways by pointing out how truly gay shes not holds up a disc this one
beat actually its kind of gotten to me
bankys not known for believing misinformation
hes got a pretty good bullshit detector
so what if it is true
would that bother you
sex with multiple partners
hooper lets our a faux shock shriek
at the same time
again even louder hands slapped against his cheeks
thanks for being so comforting
so what do you care
well thats the thing isnt it
but it gets to me
kind of gal alyssa is you dont think shes been in the middle of an all girl group grope
you see that doesnt bother me
but the thought of her and guys
oh holden i beg you please dont drop fifty stories in my opinion of you by falling prey to that latest of trendy beasts
its oh so acceptable to be a gay girl nowadays
people think its cute because theyve got this fool picture in their heads about lipstick lesbians like they all resemble alyssa while most of them look more like you
do i detect a little inter subculture cattiness
gay or straight uglys still ugly
and most of those boys are scary
i thought fags were all supposed to be super supportive of one another
screw that all for one shit
i gotta deal with being the minority in the minority of the minority and nobodys supporting my ass
while the whole of society is fawning over girls on girls here i sit a reviled gay man and to top that off im a gay black man notoriously the
most swishy of the bunch
theres a line
a young black kid approaches hooper holding a comic book
are you hooper x
in militant mode a salaam alaikum little brother
could you sign my comic
signing comic nods to holden see that guy there
hes the devil you understand
never take your eye off the man
our people took their eyes off him one time and he had us in chains in two shakes of his snakes tail
the kid offers holden an angry look
hooper gives him back his comic
fight the power little g
word is bond the kid leaves hooper slips back into his real voice
look at what i have to resort to for professional respect
what is it about gay men that terrifies the rest of the world
shakes his head as for this hang up with alyssas past maybe whats really bothering you is that your fragile fantasy might not be true
what do you mean
holden dont even try to come off like you dont know what im saying
men need to believe that theyre marco fucking polo when it comes to sex like theyre the only ones whove ever explored new territory
and its hard not to let them believe it
i let my boys run with it for awhile feed them some of that ive never done this before
bullshit and let em labor under the delusion that they rockin my world until i cant stand them anymore
then i hit em with the truth
its a sick game
the world would be a better place if people would just accept that theres nothing new under the sun and everything you can do with a person has probably been
done long before you got there
i can accept that
honey that almost sounded convincing
do yourself a favor just ask her about her past point blank
get it out of the way before it gets too big for both yall to move
spotting something oc oooh
hooper trots off holden glances at the disc in his hands
pictured on it are two gorgeous chicks barely clad making out
the title is men suck
and so do girls all xxx action
on the ice two teams clash chasing the puck up and back checking galore
in the bleachers amidst a slew of fans alyssa watches the game with a large degree of enjoyment
sitting beside her holden doesnt seem to share her enthusiasm
since most of these people are rooting for the home team im going to cheer for the visitors
im a big visitors fan especially the kind that make coffee for you in the morning before they go
smiles at holden no response that was a joke
a little wacky wordplay
what do you mean visitors
was i being too obscure
the kind that until recently had no dicks and would spend the night
so that was until recently
shouting to ice hey foul
he was traveling or something
so nobody bur me has stayed the night at your place since we got together
beat something on your mind holden
no i was just wondering if ive been faithful or something
look i was just asking
toucher his face oh sweetie
i only have eyes for you
to ice to holden i told you i was great at sporting events
imagine what a bitch i could be if i knew what was going on
on the ice things heat up between two opposing players
one snatches the puck away from the other and skates off
the other player gives chase
alyssas very into the game
holden shakes his head thatd make banky half right
he said all the girls from north were bitches and sluts
im sorry you two left high school behind how many years ago
grabs his face and kisses his cheek can i put some of my books in your locker
goes back to watching game under his breath how about your yearbook
on the ice the player giving chase slashes the player with the puck
alyssa jumps to her feet
to ice to guy next to her right
whats with finger cuffs
sitting back down finger cuffs
in your senior yearbook your nickname was finger cuffs
what is that
shit damned if i can remember
id look it up but i threw all that shit our years ago
beat whered you see a north yearbook
do you know rick derris
on the ice the players skid into the corner where player one checks player two into the boards hard
player two scrambles to his feet and throws down his gloves
the crowd around alyssa and holden go wild
we used to hang out in high school
to ice did you go out with him or something
eyes on the ice date rick derris
we just hung out a lot
you and him
me rick and
what was that guys name
god i havent thought about that name in years
on the ice the players square off
player two pulls player ones helmet off and punches him in the face
holden looks as if hed like to do the same to his companion
alyssas into the game
i remember those guysd come over almost everyday after school
theyd bug my sisters look for porno tapes in my dads closet raid our fridge
they really took advantage of my parents never being home
on the ice player two yanks at player ones jersey and gut punches him
alyssa seems oblivious to holdens anger so enthralled with the action is she
starts laughing this one day
rick pulled out his dick and chased me around the house with it
right in front of cohee
i couldnt believe it
guys are weird i thought the whole size hang up made you all terrified to show your dicks to each other
on the ice player one staggers a bit then quickly rights his jersey and lunges at player two landing a barrage of his own punches
blood sprays across the ice
holdens face is reeeeeaaaally sour looking
alyssas still in the game
rick pulled his dick out
whatd you do
looks him dead in the eye i blew him while cohee fucked me
on the ice player one delivers the kill shot slamming his fist into player twos nose
the blood shoots out like a geyser and two goes down hard
holden stares at alyssa flabbergasted
the crowd around them stares not at the fight on the ice but the fight in their midst shocked
thats what you wanted to hear isnt it
isnt that what this little cross examination of yours is about
well try not to be so obvious about it next time there are subtler ways of badgering a witness
to bystander am i right
to holden jeez even i knew what you were getting at
gathering her stuff if you wanted some background information on me all you had to do was ask id have gladly volunteered it
you didnt have to play hercules fucking poirot
she storms away
holden chases after her
the bystander watches them go
to companion i told you these were good seats
alyssa marches quickly pulling on her coat
holden catches up to her
we track with them our into the parking lot
so its true
in fact everything you heard or dug up on me was probably true
yeah i took on two guys at once
you want to hear some gems you might not have unearthed i took a twenty six year old guy to my senior prom and then left halfway through to have
sex with him and gwen turner in the back of a limo
and the girl who got caught in the shower with miss moffit the gym teacher
that was me
or how about in college when i let shannon hamilton videotape us having sex only to find out the next day that he broadcast it on the campus cable station
theyre all true those and so many more
didnt you know
im the queen of urban legend
how the hell could you do those things
some of it i did out of stupidity some of it i did out of what i thought was love but good or bad they were my choices and im
not making apologies for them now not to you or anyone
and how dare you try to lay a guilt trip on me about it in public no less
who the fuck do you think you are you judgemental prick
how am i supposed to feel about all of this
how are you supposed to feel about it
feel what ever the fuck you want about it
the only thing that really matters is how you feel about me
i dont know how i feel about you now
because i had some sex
yes holden thats all it was some sex
most of it stupid high school sex for christs sake
like you never had sex in high school
theres a world of fucking difference between typical high school sex and two guys at once
they fucking used you
i used them
you dont think i wouldve let it happen if i hadnt wanted it to do you
i was an experimental girl for christs sake
maybe you knew early on that your track was from point a to b but unlike you i wasnt given a fucking map at birth so i tried it all
that is until we thats you and i got together and suddenly i was sated
cant you take some fucking comfort in that
you turned out to be all i was ever looking for the missing piece in the big fucking puzzle
tries to calm down look im sorry i let you believe that you were the only guy id ever been with
i shouldve been more honest
but it seemed to make you feel special in a way that me telling you over and over again how incredible you are would never get across
she touches his face
he pulls back
she stares at him hurt and pissed
do you mean to tell me that while you have zero problem with me sleeping with half the women in new york city you have some sort of half assed
mealy mouthed objection to pubescent antics that took place almost ten years ago
what the fuck is your problem
holdens eyes are downcast
alyssa waits for a response
i want us to be something that we cant
and whats that
beat a normal couple
holden skulks off
alyssa stares after him and then starts kicking and punching a car beside her finally slumping to the ground
holden sits on the couch alone in the dark
the door opens and banky enters
he stands there sizing up holdens mood
banky nods back
he stands there for a beat
then he sits beside holden
he opens his arms
holden shifts into his friends embrace and begins crying on his shoulder
banky pats his back
pull back on a man in pain and the comfort of a friend
holden sits alone at a booth
he stirs his iced tea
yo look at this morose mother fucker here
holden looks up
jay and silent bob stand above him
smells like somebody shit in his cereal
holden offers a half smile
the pair slide into the booth
what took you so long
we were at the mall

holden pulls an envelope out of his jacket and tosses it to jay
jay opens it and pulls out a thick wad of bills along with the latest issue of bluntman and chronic
man this likeness rights shit is more profitable than selling smoke
howd a dirt merchant like you ever learn about likeness rights
hands envelope to silent bob we deal to a lot of lawyers
speaking of which

holden looks out the window
jay continues to roll his joint

holdens head snaps forward
he stares wide eyed at silent bob
what did you say

holden stares shocked
he looks to jay whos still rolling his joint
what do you look so shocked for
he does this all the time
fat bastard thinks just because he never says anything that itll have some huge impact when he does open his fucking mouth
why dont you shut up
always yap yap yapping all the time
give me a fucking headache
to holden i went through something like what youre going through
same kind of thing with a girl named amy
a couple of years ago
whatd she live in canada or something
why dont i remember this
what you dont know about me i can just about squeeze into the grand fucking canyon
did you know i always wanted to be a dancer in vegas
jay and holden look at him
silent bob busts a move with his hands
bet you didnt know that
just cell your fucking story so we can get out of here and smoke this
to holden so theres me an amy and were all inseparable right
just big time in love
and then about four months in i ask about the ex boyfriend
dumb move i know but you know how it is you dont really want to know but you just have to
stupid guy bullshit
anyway she starts telling me all about him how they dated for years lived together her mother likes me better blah blah blah and im okay
but then she tells me that a couple times he brought other people to bed with them menage a tois i believe its called
now this just blows my mind
i mean im not used to that sort of thing right
i was raised catholic
silent bob backhands him
jay raises his fist as if to strike
to holden so i get weirded out and just start blasting her right
this is the only way i can deal with it by calling her a slut and telling her that she was used i mean im out for blood i want
to hurt her because i dont know how to deal with what im feeling
and im like what the fuck is wrong with you
and shes telling me that it was that time in that place and she didnt do anything wrong so shes not gonna apologize
so i tell her its over and i walk
it was a mistake
i wasnt disgusted with her i was afraid
at that moment i felt small like id lacked experience like id never be on her level or never be enough for her or something
and what i didnt get was that she didnt care
she wasnt looking for that guy anymore
she was looking for me
but by the time i realized this it was too late you know
shed moved on and all i had to show for it was some foolish pride which then gave way to regret
she was the girl i know that now
but i pushed her away
everyones silent silent bob lights a cigarette
so ive spent every day since then chasing amy
takes a drag from his smoke so to speak
they sit there for a beat
jay pockets the rest of his dime bag
enough of this fucking melodrama
my advice forget her dude
theres one woman in the world
one woman with many faces
to silent bob get up bitch to holden we gotta book
were catching a bus to chi town
how many more of those phat envelopes do we got coming to us
i dont know
i dont know if the books going to be around much longer

theres millions of people out there thatd love to see themselves in a comic book
i spend every fucking waking hour with one of them
but it aint like us at all all slapsticky and shit running around like dicks saying
whats that shit you got me saying
who talks like that
thats baby talk
slaps his hand its a big world g but were bound to run into you again
until then keep your unit on you
do or do not there is no ay
slaps him knock it off
get your fat ass moving we got a bus to catch
under his breath jedi bitch
exit jay and silent bob
holden remains in the booth thinking
holden sits at his drawing table tapping his pencil up and down
alyssa sits in a club getting talked at by some women
shes not present in the conversation
banky meets with sloss at a restaurant sloss shakes the contracts at him and banky makes the i know i know face
holden stares at the picture alyssa gave him
alyssa with her ear to the phone
she hangs up angrily
holden sits in the park that he and alyssa walked through
hes staring at alyssas yearbook picture
he closes the book and sighs
then an idea hits him
he jumps up and dashes out of the park
banky and alyssa sit on the couch
holden paces in front of them
i know youre wondering why i asked you both here tonight at the same time knowing that we have shit to settle between us separately
i just figured you wanted to kill two birds with one stone by telling her to fuck off with me here so you didnt have to go through the story
again later on
not even if you let me videotape it
they both look at him ive been going through things over and over
and i dissected it all and looked at it a thousand different ways
banky theres friction between us for the first time in our lives
you hate me dating alyssa and you want me to sign off on this m tv thing
alyssa you and i hit a wall because i dont know how to deal with
your past i guess
thats a nice way of putting it
id have said the whole double stuff thing
right in his face im only going to say it once shut up
back to pacing now i know im to blame one way or the other on both accounts
with you alyssa its my fault because i feel inadequate
because youve had so much experience had such a big life and my lifes been pretty small in comparison
that doesnt matter to me
i have to get through this
beat and with you banky i know why youre having such a hard time with alyssa and its something thats been obvious forever but i guess i just didnt acknowledge
takes a deep breath youre in love with me
makes a face beat what
youre attracted to me
just as in a way im attracted to you
i mean it makes sense weve been together so long we have so much in common
getting up well ive got to get home and catch the last few minutes of babylon so ill be
holden grabs him kisses him full on the lips and pushes him back onto the couch alyssa reacts
banky wide eyed and speechless looks away
its something youre going to have to deal with
you may very well be gay which explains your homophobia and why youre so jealous of alyssa and your sense of humor as well
just cause a guys got a predilection coward dick jokes
deal with it
youll feel much better
he grabs a chair from the side of the room
now at this point you may be asking yourself the question that ive been going over and over in my head for the last few days what does one have
to do with the other
alyssas face drops
she subtly shakes her head
under her breath dont
and when i did some serious soul searching it came at me from out of nowhere and suddenly it all made sense a calm came over me
i know what we have to do
and then you bank you alyssa and i all of us
can finally be
again under her breath please dont say it
sits in the chair takes a long beat weve all got to have sex together
the room is silent
holden lights a cigarette
bankys eyes nearly bug
alyssas head drops
dont you see
that would take care of everything
alyssa i wouldnt feel inadequate or too conservative anymore
ill have done something on par with all the experience youve had
and itll be with you whichll make it that much more powerful
and banky you can cake that leap that everyone else but you sees that you should take
and itll be okay because itll be with me your best friend for years
weve been everything to each other but intimates
and now well have been through that together too
and it wont have to be a total leap for you because a woman will be involved
and when its over all that aggression you feel toward alyssa will be gone
because youll have shared in something beautiful with the woman i love
itll be cathartic
a true communion
we have to do this
for me for both of you
for all of our sakes
this will keep us together
beat what do you say
banky stares forward wide eyed
he leans back into the couch and lets out a huge sigh
holden smiles at his friend
then he looks at alyssa
you know i need this
you know itll help
alyssa looks at him sadly
holden reacts shocked banky lets out a sigh of relief
i thought youd be into this
what does that say about me
this should be no big deal for you
you dont want this
lights her cigarette you really dont want this
i need this
this has to happen
why cant you see that
and how can you not
what does that say about me
you can take it from two guys whose names you can barely remember but i ask you to share an experience like it where its about intimacy and you say
inhales from her cigarette takes a beat i cant
holden moves to her side of the couch
ill be there
and when its over well be the strongest weve ever been because we got through some nasty shit together
and well finally be on the same level together
and then therell be nothing we cant accomplish
a tear rolls down her cheek she looks at him sadly and touches his face
trying to compose herself that time is over for me
ive been there
ive done it
and i didnt find what i was looking for in any of it
i found that in you in us
doing this wont help you forget about the things youre hung up on
itll create more
no it wont
i thought about all of that
no it will
maybe youll see me differently from then on maybe youll despise me for going along with it once youre in the moment
maybe ill moan differently and then youll resent banky and become suspicious of us
or youll alienate him because of it and then grow to blame and hate me for the deterioration of your friendship
or what if i sincerely doubt it but what if i saw something in banky that i never saw before and fell in love with him and left you
ive been down roads like this before many times
i know you feel doing this will broaden your horizons and give you experience
but ive had those experiences on my own
i cant accompany you on yours
im past that now
touches his face stares to cry or maybe i just love you too much
and i feel hurt and let down that youd want to share me with anyone
because i never wanted to share you holds it in gets up regardless i cant be a part of this
beat or you
not anymore hugs him i love you
i always will
she releases him then slaps him
but im not your fucking whore
alyssa storms away stopping briefly to look banky up and down
hes yours again
she walks our of the studio
the door closes behind her
banky and holden stand there silently
cut to black
its one year later
were at another show not unlike the one from the opening
a copy of bluntman and chronic enters the frame
the cover reads the death chronic complete with a corresponding drawing
blast from the past
banky sits at his own signing table
behind him hangs a banner that reads banky edwards creator of baby dave
a small line is formed in front of him
he talks with a do you know how much its going for these days
you signing it will push that up even higher if you sell it i want a kickback starts signing i dont know if this is true but i heard once
that there was going to be an animated series
there was going to be what happened
off comic youre looking at it
no chronic no cartoon that sucks man
that wouldve been awesome
tell me about it is that what happened to you and holden mcneil
you got into a fight over the rights or something
it was a little more involved than that
whatever happened to him
he quit the biz
you guys dont talk anymore
looks oc no
banky locks eyes with someone oc
his expression softens
holden leans against a wall on the far side of the room
he smiles at banky
banky smiles back and sort of nods
holden holds up a copy of bankys new solo comic
he points to it and gives a thumbs up
probably shouldnt have killed off chronic
banky smiles to oc
some doors just shouldnt be opened
banky looks in another direction oc
he looks at holden and points to it
holden looks in the same direction and then looks back at banky and nods
you dont need that guy anyway
you do great stuff without him
banky looks at holden for a beat
then he brings his pointer fingers together mimicing holdens shared moment gesture
holden shrugs slightly then crosses his fingers as if to say hopefully
you were just carrying that guy anyway
banky sort of smiles at the oc holden
then he offers his own thumbs up as to say good luck
to fan still looking oc youre so right
holden smiles back nods bye and walks off
well keep up the good work man
love them dick jokes
the fan leaves but banky is watching holden go
shakes it off okay
alyssa sits at a separate signing table with a line in front of her
a woman behind her
alyssa dashes off signatures in the copies of her comic
to oc departing fan thanks for reading it
the woman stands and rubs her shoulders
im going to get a soda
you want anything
im fine thanks the woman heads off
alyssa starts rummaging through her bag
not rooking up okay whos next
a comic book drops on the table in front of her
its a comic book called chasing amy
she leafs through it not looking up
this isnt one of mine
alyssa looks up sharply
holden stands before her smiling
i saved you one
beat howve you been
good beat off her own comic new issues selling like crazy for some reason
because its so good
i really liked it
off comic i havent even seen this yet
did it just come out
a month ago
i did a really small run
only about five hundred issues
will i enjoy it
its familiar subject matter
alyssa leafs through it
her eyes get somewhat misty
looks like a very personal story
i finally had something personal to say
they look at each other for a beat im going to go
i dont want to hold up the line
i mean it can get ugly
i just saw this nun in line call this small child a cunt rag
smiles read that when you have a minute i will
id like to hear your thoughts about it
if you get a chance give me a call
they look at each other for a beat
nice seeing you again really nice to see you too
he walks away
a few steps away he turns and waves again
she waves back
and then he starts moving through the thrall of fan boys
the woman returns with coffee
she follows alyssas gaze
who was that
just some guy i knew
she watches him go for another beat then
to line next to woman so what do you want to do tonight
and as they fall into conversation the show goes on
