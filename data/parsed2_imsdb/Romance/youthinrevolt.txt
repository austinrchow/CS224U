written by gustin nash july over black comes the sound of deep heaving breaths
moist flesh flapping accompaniment
someone is beating off
a pause as the someone turns the page of a magazine
the beating off resumes at a quickened pace
the squeaking of bed springs joins in
another page is turned
feverish thumping until a male voice lets out a quiet moan
the breathing gradually slows to normal and lets out a relieved sigh of finality
nick twisp stares up at the ceiling
hes glassy eyed from the exertion
sprawled on the bed trousers around his ankles a well thumbed issue of penthouse covers his privates
my last name which i loath is twisp
nick pulls up his trousers and leaps off the bed
he pulls the drawer under his mattress out
the next thing you should know about me is that i am obsessed with sex
a view of the drawer reveals it to be filled with neatly filed issues of penthouse and hustler
he puts the most recently utilized magazine in its place
lately i have become morbidly aware of my penis
nick posing in front of the mirror pants around his ankles again
he looks at himself from various angles
once a remote region accessed indifferently for micturition it has developed overnight into a gaudy las vegas of the body
we pan down and where nicks crotch is supposed to be there is a hole in the screen leading us to
the pulsing neon sign outside the club reads nicks penis
we fly inside where we find a star studded floor show
drunken conventioneers make out with strippers
a leopard leaps through a burning hoop on stage
nick typing on an obsolete pc
i am entering the tenth grade at st
vitus academy which i am told is the most rigorous prep school in the east bay
hopefully i will be invited to join miss satrons english literature class
a view of the books and cds on his shelf
i am a voracious reader and listen to frank sinatra
so needless to say i am still a virgin
follow the curser on the monitor as he types the words he pauses in thought then continues
i have yet to hold hands with a girl let alone have my winkie up her wendell
we move down an airplane aisle past passengers sleeping and chatting
i am an only child except for my big sister joanie who has left the bosom of her family to sling hash at feet
we reach the end of the aisle where a buxom twenty something joanie twisp serves a beverage
liver frying in a pan
estelle twisp cooks and puffs on a cigarette at the same time
mom gives drivers tests at the department of motor vehicles
nick sits at the kitchen table reading the paper
he watches with nausea as estelle piles liver onto his plate
she used to keep dad up to date on all the motor statutes he was violating
this is one of the reasons they got divorced
jerry early s saunters in wearing a truckers do it in overdrive shirt and boxers
his gut hangs over the elastic but he is completely devoid of an ass
moms boyfriend jerry is a long distance trucker though his ultimate ambition is to be on state disability
jerry absently smacks estelles butt
waddles over to the breakfast table
he snatches the funnies from the paper in nicks hands
ive been struggling to think of a commendable thing to say about jerry
jerry gives an asinine chuckle at the cartoon
his grey matter registers at cretin and the needle doesnt budge
george twisp scruffy and greying waters the foliage outside the house with a high powered hose
dad is a copywriter for agricultural magazines
in the drive nick slaves over the duty of washing the rims of his dads bmw i
hed like to own a more prestigious model of bmw but as he often reminds me he is burdened with crippling child support payments
nick glances up and spots lacey coming up the drive toward him in a weensy bikini
her body has more outcroppings than the coastline of albania
she continues past him and embraces george
lacey is dads latest bimbette
she is twenty and a recently minted alumna of stanfort
super stanfort institute of cosmetology george and lacey exchange saliva shamelessly
nick turns his attention back to the beamer
as the making out becomes heated groping georges grip on the hose slackens
nick gets blindsided by the jet of water
were back with nick as he types on his computer
he looks down at the tent in his boxers
he pulls open the drawer again the pornography collection
of the room shaking accompanied by his heavy breathing
his eyes float from the hustler to the pink walls of his room
my mother is the one who painted my room to look like dolly partons boudoir
she read this color was used in hospitals to calm mental patients
nick closes his eyes his right arm moving rhythmically
ill tell you what i told her
i am not mentally ill
the masturbation reaches its feverous climax
then the long moan and sigh of relief
im just a teenager
and as frank sinatras until the real thing comes along begins we go to opening credits
nick regards jerry from across the dining room table
there is the off screen sound of a cretin slurping cheerios
reveal jerry reading sports illustrated scratching his balls with one hand and shoveling in cereal with the other
estelle is washing dishes when she spies something out the window
where did that car come from
jerry looks over his shoulder and they all take a moment to appreciate the slab sided lincoln in the drive
its a lincoln convertible
like the one kennedy was shot in
except his was black and yours is white
i was going to take you and your mom for a spin after breakfast
but now i guess itll just be her and me
you have your smart mouth to thank for that
i guess ill just have to hang out all alone at the book depository
jerry i dont understand
what happened to the chevy nova
sold it to a sailor on the alameda naval air base
a man should never own a car for more than three months estelle
that way he always gets the thrill of owning a new automobile
jerry smiles with cretin pride
nick looks to his mother and disturbingly enough she seems turned on by his car owner savvy
nick stands in the doorway watching as his mother waits for jerry to open the passenger door for her
after spending twelve years with dad mom has had a string of lovers none of whom she has asked me to approve
jerry fails to notice estelle waiting and instead just climbs in and chugs his beer
estelle appears mildly disappointed before opening the door herself
im starting to think her boyfriends are like u
as jerry pulls out he tosses his beer bottle in the direction of the trash can at the end of the drive
just when you think they cant get any worse
he misses and the bottle shatters on the pavement but jerry drives off anyway
she manages to find gods perfect asshole
nick cycles through tivo and finds the late night sex documentary he recorded
from the living room comes the sound of an orgy and the jingle jangle of a belt buckle
then the ding dong of the front doorbell
the jingle jangle pauses and when the doorbell rings a second time the orgy gets muted
nick enters the kitchen pulling up his trousers
the door is opened to reveal two burly tattooed sailors standing on the stoop
their eyes drift to nicks mid section
nick follows their eyes to the belt buckle he neglected to fasten out of haste
he returns his gaze to the sailors as he wrangles the belt
is jerry here
he just left
whats up is that hunk of shit chevy he sold us made it seventeen miles before the engine blew up
and we found evidence of a banana in the transmission
the second sailor holds aloft the banana peel sealed in a plastic bag
nick glances to drive and regards the smoking chevy nova with its camouflage paint job
a third sailor is rummaging through the boxes in the open garage
he finds some spray paint and shakes the can
nick turns back to the sailors on the stoop
so he owes us nine hundred dollars
well i think he used that nine hundred dollars to buy his lincoln
hes giving my mom a joyride in it now
but hell be back this afternoon so i would come back then
hes pretty stubborn
you might have to beat it out of him
that can be arranged
in the meantime were leaving the piece of shit in the driveway
with a note
nick looks one more time to the chevy as the third sailor finishes painting the hood with the words pay up or die
i like it
very to the point
see you guys this afternoon
the sailors nod somewhat perplexed by this kids demeanor
as they turn to go and nick closes the door
i might have to kill myself
in the clearing a uc jock stands behind his asian girlfriend kissing her neck and removing her clothes
i hope you have a good reason
reveal nick and his friend lefty belly down in the grass overlooking the clearing
lefty watches the copulating couple with a pair of binoculars
my sister said she saw millie filbert holding hands with some college guy
i dunno lefty
i think your sister is just waging psychological warfare
well its working
what am i gonna do nick
i think about millie so much my balls ache
maybe your just not wacking off enough
as if in response lefty passes the binoculars off to nick and then turns over onto his back and unzips his pants
as lefty jerks it nick looks with nonchalance
the couple hump in the grass her legs in the air
so ive been taping my pecker to my right leg at night
in case you havent heard leftys erect member takes a dramatic turn midway up the shaft
then i look at this issue of better homes and gardens that has a girl that looks just like millie until it gets good and hard
i think its starting to straighten out
why dont you just have your parents take you to the dick doctor
are you kidding
it would kill them to know that i even get hard ons
still you might want to get it fixed before asking millie out
what if i shove it up the wrong hole
nick gives a dubious glance in leftys direction
leftys grasp of the female anatomy is somewhat tenuous he imagines there are orifices galore down there
nick you little shit get down here
jerry hollers from the kitchen where estelle gapes out the window
nick calmly joins them from upstairs
nick do you know anything about this
she points out the window and they all take in the chevy and the sailors oh so subtle note on the hood
those sailors came by
they want their money back
i guess there was a banana in the transmission
you tell them when i was coming back
now why would i do that
jerry seeths inwardly at nicks mock innocence
what are you going to do jerry
i think ill go get the lincoln washed
what happens when the sailor comes back for his nine hundred dollars
just tell him he bought the car with my standard guarantee
thirty days or thirty feet
whichever comes first
im in the right
and on cue comes the ring of the doorbell and the simultaneous pounding of angry navy fists on the back door
they peer out the window and find the fleet on the front steps
the sailors are here
jerry first starts to dart one way and then another searching for a hiding space as he hisses
get rid of them
and then the front door gets kicked open and a mob of sailors pour in
a handheld cam chase as he heads for the back and is cut off by the sailors coming in
jerry bolts up the stairs
jerry where are you going
just tell them you are in the right
they manage to grab jerry by the legs and haul him down the stairs
jerry loses his grasp step by step crying with a sound not unlike e
when the flashlight hit him in the cornfield
the two big guys with bad haircuts hold jerry off the ground while the earnstwhile chevy owner goes through his pockets
sixty three lousy dollars
thats my life savings
one of the sailors pokes jerry in the gut hard and he whimpers
dont hurt him
touch that phone kid and you lose your left nut
nick raises his hands
you dont have to tell me twice
please dont hurt me
its all i got guys
take the lincoln
i dont want the lincoln
i want my nine hundred dollars
im taking the sixty three which means you owe me another eight hundred and thirty
eight hundred and thirty seven actually
have it by tomorrow or youll be found in the trunk of your new used piece of shit at the bottom of the bay
and with that they release him and jerry crumples to the floor like an abandoned marionette
the three of them watch the fleet pile into a navy van that reads for official use only
the moment they pull out jerry dusts himself off and puts on a pretense of being unfazed
wow those guys are even dumber than i thought
they actually think im stupid enough to let them muscle me into paying
jerry what are you talking about
we need to call the police
im not some tattle tale like your son
nick rolls his eyes
then for gods sake jerry just sell the lincoln and pay them
its in the code
the vehicular code
code of the streets babe
code of the streets
then what are you planning to do
jerry takes a seat at the kitchen table and adopts the thinker pose
he strokes his chin as nick and estelle await his brilliant solution with breathless anticipation
we are going to ukiah for a last minute vacation
jerrys got on a hat made from coors beer cans
hes behind the wheel of his lincoln convertible
jerry says well be staying in a cabin on clear lake thats owned by a friend of his
estelle dumps in the cooking gear and closes the trunk
her halter top looks like an advertisement for droop city
nicks in the back
estelle waves at the neighbors like shes miss corn dog of
were going on vacation
she hops up front with jerry
he fires up the lincoln and the radio roars to life with hillbilly music
im not sure how this is the solution to his problem
but ive decided to go along with it seeing as im not rooting for him anyway
as they pull out jerry tosses his beer bottle at the garbage can at the end of the drive and it once again misses and shatters on the street behind
the lincoln makes its way upstate and dips into the mist covered hills of ukiah
theyve pulled to a stop
estelle stares in horror
you said it was a cabin
in the back nick removes his sunglasses to regard the long green turd of a trailer
some concrete dwarves in the grass
a dusty canvas awning over a small cement patio
a decrepit picket fence with a sign that reads my green haven
estelle looks as if shes about to cry
jerry puts his arm around her
its real cute on the inside
substitute cluttered for cute
the three of them are crammed around a dining surface as accommodating as an airplane tray table
d religious art hangs on the wall above them
i say the kid does the dishes and we retire to the master bedroom
jerry pushes out and disappears into the back
nick watches him with loathing
estelle smiles apologetically
do you really like jerry
her smile fades
nick how many men do you think there are whod be interested in a forty one year old woman with two brats no money and stretch marks
and with that she excuses herself leaving nick to ponder
mom is a realist about everything
except her age
shes forty three
nick washes dishes in the toilet like sink
the trailer shakes from the two adults flogging the mattress in the back
an old crone mrs
saunders makes her way up the walk
she gets to the door of my green haven and bangs on the screen
nick sleeps on a pull out cot
he bolts upright at the banging his hair going in all directions
its your neighbor mrs
church services begin at seven fifteen prompt
donuts will be served
nick glances down at the morning wood elevating his boxers
saunders narrows her eyes at nick through the screen door and takes off
nick steps out of the trailer in a bathrobe toiletries in one hand towel in the other
he heads off down the wooded path
the serene melodies of rousing hymns float from the well attended congregation in the meeting hall
we track across the trees as nick makes his way down the path
he slows to observe the sun coming through the canopy overhead
he glances off the path and comes to a sudden stop
a grape arbor flanked by corinthian columns set against the blue of clear lake
a chestnut haired sheeni saunders stands facing the water her head tilted down to read the book in her hands
the wind coming off the lake blows her dress just enough to give a hint of the shapely thighs underneath
light falls in shafts through the latticework of the arbor like something out of a francois boucher painting
the moment i see her i know the gods while having cruelly endowed me with imperfect posture and pussy postponing pimples had put me here for a purpose
my heart palpitates
my mind races
i get an instant super thundering erection sheeni glances up from her book and looks over her shoulder at him
nick just stares
she gives an amused smile almost flirtatious
nick grins back
your robe is open
nick looks down
he pulls the robe closed scowls and goes into a flustered march down the path
an austere cement shed with three dripping shower heads and no privacy walls
nick lathers up under the spray
jerry appears in the foreground and removes his robe
he goes to the shower head next to nick and turns it on
nick reacts to jerry and hastily tries to resume rinsing himself off
jerry gurgles water and spits
he starts warbling rock lyrics
nick comes up the path and stops short at the picket fence
estelle and sheeni squat on the patio steps
hel lo excitable boy
nick honey meet sheeni saunders
sheeni needs to go to the grocery store
ive offered her your help in carrying her bags
nick regards sheeni and her mischievous smirk
thanks a pantsful
a dusty road
nick totes a watermelon and a paper bag
he watches as sheeni works on a popsicle
full lips that cry out to be kissed
you dont have to go to services
much to the consternation of my fanatical parents i have converted to atheism
fortunately my brother paul paved the way for such transgressions
paul is an atheist too
buddhist i believe though we have not seen him in some time
i myself am looking forward to being free of parental bondage
well your mother seems very nice though your father i think might be rather dim
jerry and i share no blood links of any kind
as they pass the meeting hall there comes a surge of hymns in chorus
sounds rather zealous
yes even though i am no longer a believer i always found the services wonderfully aerobic
you could say the same thing about sex
she looks at nick intently
nick are you going to turn out like all the other young men and have nothing on your mind except carnal pleasures
i hardly ever think about sex
i think about it all the time
its the hormones at work you know
she resumes walking
nick follows her with confusion
they regard the two story pacemaker mobile home
a second floor
father bought it so that he could look down upon the world
for him christian humility has always been a struggle
sheeni relieves him of the watermelon
well it was nice to meet you nick
she trudges down the slate path to the home
do you want to come to the beach with me
she turns around
gives a little smirk
what a thoughtful invitation
id love to nick
wait for me in the living room
a lot more space than my green haven
dark paneling and somewhat more tasteful religious art
back in a moment
nick watches her bound up the stairs
he wanders into the musty living area
moves down the mantel examining the trinkets
stops to regard the reproduction of massaccios expulsion of adam and eve from eden on the wall
he scrutinizes the image his eyes falling to the privates of adam and eve
i understand you have invited my daughter to the beach
nick spins around to see mr
saunders reclining in his armchair
he is an immense florid faced verdant eye browed ogre in a rumpled blue suit
er yes mr
then i trust sir you are aware that in doing so you have entered into an oral contract to perform in loco parentis i
to provide for the safety and well being of aforementioned minor female
oh father do shut up
sheeni descends the stairs
jean cut offs over a knockout yellow swimsuit that shows off her flowing nubility
sheeni grabs up a straw beach bag and pushes nick out the door
lets go nick
vaya con dios
sheeni and nick lay on their backs on the blue beach blanket reading their respective books
nick watches her turning pages and making notes in the margins
she hands him her tanning lotion
would you mind applying this to my exposed areas
not at all
she rolls over onto her stomach exposing her exquisite back
nick straddles her hands shaking as he smooths sweet oils into her tanned flesh
flashing super thundering erection my you get turned on easily
nicks hands freeze
oh dont stop nick
we all have our hormones to deal with
girls are fortunate in that it doesnt show
for all the world knows my vagina could be moist with desire as we speak
thats none of your business im sure
shall you do my front too
im up for it
she rolls over onto her back her young breasts straining up against the yellow spandex
i hope you dont find it too stimulating nick
he starts in on her flawless legs gliding on the oil all the way within a fingers reach of her sweet apex
with each daring pass he comes closer to that final split
finally the hand swerves too late and lightly grazes the softly yielding vee
maybe you better do the top now
nick moves up lubricating her arms shoulders and neck
he smooths the oil on the soft undulating foothills
she rolls back onto her stomach with finality and goes back to her book
nick hovers above her a moment then painfully returns to his own reading
they make their way down the path
nick totes the beach bag
breathless is one of my favorite films though it might be eclipsed by rebel without a cause
i often wonder what american cinema would be like today had dean done more than three
nick nods and for a beat they trek on in silence
he glances down at her hand and fumbles for it with his own
you seem very nice
but in fairness i should tell you that i have a boyfriend
nick becomes sickeningly pale
whats his name
whats he like
seventeen years of age six two fluent in french plays the piano a champion swimmer and writes futurist percussive poetry
they stop at the gate to the saunders home
im not familiar with futurist percussive poems
i could recite one of trents if youd like
she takes a dramatic pause
ramdam sizzle mop crunch down safety net hot
she gives a slightly amused smile at nicks blank expression
if thats poetry im a turkey scrotum
time lapse of nick thrashing about in bed
during this montage there is the constant ticking of a clock
here is an hour by hour account of the worst night of my life
nick flipping through a penthouse under the covers
i decide it is just a case of puppy love and look forward to the interesting women i shall meet in the future
a light comes on in the window
nick at the dining table writing a note
i conclude the only way out is suicide
i begin to pen a poignant suicide note
sheeni will see trent for the shallow pedant he is and always treasure my memory
turn off the damn light
nick paces about back and forth in the yard
i decide i am too chicken for any of the manly violent means of suicide
i shall swallow sleeping pills
where to get them though
nick is in bed jerking off
the trailer shakes despite his best efforts
i can not die an inviolate virgin
either i find a way to get laid soon or suicide gets postponed until after high school
you wanna beat your meat go outside
nick in the shower going to town on his t
it will be too painful to see sheeni again
i shall ask mom if we can cut our vacation short and return to oakland
nick rolls over on the cot and looks up with the gaze of a manic insomniac
i have to see sheeni again
the door opens to reveal nick standing outside in shorts an im single lets mingle shirt and tennis shoes
sheeni stands in the door
sleep fogged eyes
god what time is it
how about breakfast
smiling with endearment come back in two hours
im going on a hike
you can join me if youd like
she closes the door
super one hour fifty seven minutes later a knock on the door
sheeni opens it to reveal
nick dressed the same
sheeni wears khakis red bandanna neckerchief and an australian bush hat
she looks like the worlds most desirable girl scout
she examines nicks attire
nick where are your hiking boots water bottle provisions survey maps and compass
like john muir i enter the wilderness with nothing more than my journal and a childlike sense of wonder
okay but i have no plans to baby any slackers
sheeni leads the way up hill
nick clutches his cramped stomach with one hand his journal in the other
he watches the rhythmic movements of her ass through her hiking shorts
nick and sheeni peer over the edge of the cliff
the waters of clear lake churn below
quite a drop
not to be morbid but this sight has been the chosen means of at least three teen suicides
quite a hike just to end your life
well there is a road
but i agree
adolescents have a tendency toward the over dramatic
sheeni backs away
nick stays staring over the edge
nicks eyes roll back as he relieves himself against a tree
he shakes off the last of it and zips up
he emerges from the woods only to find sheeni reading his journal
she looks up at his and smiles
the brazen sneak isnt even embarrassed
thats my journal
dont get so upset nick
though your handwriting is egregious you have a fairly decent vocabulary
although trent is not an affected twit
nick snatches the journal out of her hands
those are my private thoughts and are none of your business
the lengths you say you are willing to go to to win my heart the contemplation of suicide at the thought of not having me
taking a sensual breath it all evokes a strong emotional warmth in my breast
nick can only stare at her sprawled out on her back as if posing for a centerfold
did you mean it nickie
a beat as he is lost in the ocean of her gaze before he manages to gain his senses
how would you like it if i read your journal
you can read it if youd like
she hands it over
nick squints at the writing
its in french
a necessity for a child in a household with prying christian parents
what does it say
wouldnt you like to know
that last passage would be of particular interest to you
nick leaps on top of her grabbing her thin wrists
she squeals and giggles
i demand full disclosure
they wrestle perspiring squirming bodies brushing together
flashing super thundering erection they pause
hes got her arms pinned
shes on her back
he hovers above her
softly chanting nickies got a hard on
nick considers her expression
youre still a virgin i can tell
maybe thats why i like you
she looks at him expectantly
nick is at a loss
kiss me you wienie
nick tentatively approaches her luscious mouth
their noses dodge successfully and their lips meet
after a long moment they break it off
staring into each others eyes
sheeni jumps up
nick lays in the grass a moment watching after her
nick walks sheeni to the gate
she turns around to face him
when can i see you again
get up early tomorrow and you can shower with me in the ladies room
five minutes to six
if you dare
nick grins with excitement
nick dines at the tray table with jerry and estelle
so whats this sheeni girl like
shes the encyclopedia britannica
shes got a nice rack
nick stares at him perhaps resolving to murder the trucker in his sleep
nick lies below us on the cot unable to sleep with the anticipation of the imminent loss of his virginity
another perfect california summer dawn a pale moon lingering in the blue morning sky
nick emerges from my green haven in his robe
he starts off down the path
the trailer park is relatively silent save for birds and the distant sound of dogs barking
nick approaches the shower building
as he nears the sound of water running can be heard from the ladies side
the womens side has real stalls and privacy doors
nick spots the chamber at the end where sheenis naked form showers obscured by tacky stained glass
he kicks off his slippers
hangs his robe on a hook
he approaches the stall
flashing super thundering erection he opens the shower door and steps into the steamy spray
he embraces her
pendulous breasts sagging skin a patch of white hair under a drooping belly wrinkles
she looks up startled
nick lets out a horrible woman like scream
saunders starts screaming too the sound of a pig being slaughtered
she hurls a bar of soap
the bar strikes nick upside the head and he loses his footing on the slippery tile
he goes down taking mrs
saunders with him
they wrangle in the mist as nick tries to escape
suddenly the door opens
its sheeni in her robe
she reaches out and pulls nick up
get out quick
still wearing her robe she dives into the spray to save her mother
nick grabs his robe and retreats
nick slouches in a corner of the shop his hands trembling as he brings his coffee to his lips
he hears the door open and looks up but instead of the cops finds sheeni
she joins him at the table
should i go to the sheriffs now
i managed to convince mother you were retarded and couldnt read the sign
nick nods thankfully
say where were you anyway
we said five minutes to six
but nick women are always discreetly late
its expected of us
and the punctual guy fries in the chair for rape
at least you got to shower with a naked woman
licking donut powder off her fingers what are your plans today
my parents want to go to middletown
jerry has the moronic notion of buying a trailer there before we leave
i should like to come with you nick
the more time we spend together the better
i fear when you leave we might never see each other again
nick nods glumly
clearly a devastating thought
sheenis in back with nick but doesnt seem to mind the wind tunnel
she has a scarf tied around her chestnut locks
nick looks down as she casually rests a hand on the inside of his thigh
as they round a curve at she yanks nicks sunglasses off and tosses them over her shoulder into the lake
estelle jerry nick and a toothless old geezer whose gut rivals jerrys all stare at a rusty rv that looks like it might not make the trip back
in the background sheeni pets a goat in the dusty yard
whats your cash price
i said in the ad
thousand dollars firm
that must be with a guarantee
as is where she is
i dont know
those rusty propane tanks are a fire hazard
the roof probably needs work
i couldnt go above eight hundred
the geezer ponders the bad news
estelle shakes her head and goes inside the rv to inspect
there are mouse droppings in all the closets jerry
i might take nine fifty
sheeni lets out a squeal of delight
they all turn their attention to where she has discovered a box full of squirming she brings one of them over
she shows him the ugly little pug
short droopy ears a tiny batlike face
to the geezer how much
sheeni turns to nick pleadingly
nick fishes through his wallet
all i have is a subway card with four stickers
no doubt close to the dogs actual value
oh thank you nickie
she plants a kiss on his lips and promptly turns her attention to the dog who licks her face affectionately
nick looks on with appropriate jealousy
im going to name him albert
pronounced al bear that dont sound like any kind of name for a dog
scowling defensively ill have you know ive named him after the deceased french writer albert camus
author of letranger and other works of existential brilliance
the geezer looks to nick with an expression of i stand corrected
nick returns with a nod that says you have no idea
the lincoln now tows the rusty rv behind it
nick watches sheeni continue to fawn over albert
nick and sheeni dine over coffee and a plate of donuts
nick watches her play with albert in her lap
sheeni i think i love you
well your hormones certainly do
and oddly enough my hormones like you too
sheeni releases albert and the mutt paws at her legs
her eyes well up with tears a few theatrical sniffles
we can visit each other when i get a drivers license
i hope thats true but
its not that
its my parents
i fear they will never allow me to keep albert
nick tries to hide his hurt
picks up the paper with annoyance
why dont you take albert
he could be our love child
at least you could consider it honey
ive never asked you for anything before
maybe i could take him but id have certain conditions
i would have to be the only dad on the scene
matter of fact trent would have to go
thats asking a lot
trent worships the ground i walk on
its your choice
life with me and the dog you love
or a pet free existence with a shallow egotistical poet
sheeni ponders this
ok nick i guess i dont have any choice
ill break up with trent
but if he kills himself its on your conscience
i accept full responsibility
well good thats settled
not quite darling
i want one more thing
what do you think
sheeni looks pensive
it fades to amusement
do you have a condom
nick lifts his eyebrows
now were getting somewhere
it has to be in a safe place
a nice comfortable bed
with no threat of interruptions
and for relaxation and mood setting some good red wine preferably french
i want a new condom
not one thats been riding around in your wallet for years
consumers rated them a while back
i suggest you get their top rated brand
this may take some research in the library
id appreciate a photocopy of the article
plus for supplementary protection i want a name brand spermicide
how about i have a quick vasectomy just to be on the safe side
matter of fact well nick that of course is up to you
nick looks displeased that his sarcasm didnt register
jerry hitches the trailer to the back of the lincoln
estelle loads up the trunk
nick honey say goodbye to sheeni
its time to hit the road
nick watches sheeni kiss albert
he looks less than enthused at the thought of sloppy seconds
finally sheeni hands nick the dog
nick and sheeni stand there an awkward beat
sheeni leans in and gives him a peck on the cheek
whispering in his ear dont forget darling
red wine and consumer reports
theyre the sexiest words nicks ever heard
he grabs her and kisses her deeply
jerry honks the horn and they break off
nick gets into the back seat with albert
the dog whimpers
sheeni stands off to the side waving at them both
back to civilization
he fires up the lincoln and they kick up dust
albert slobbers all over nick
nick sets him down and watches sheeni in the side mirror waving in the road
i have a tall mountain to climb with many treacherous glaciers still to cross but finally i have obtained a stamped entry visa to the paradise that lay beyond
sheeni watches the lincoln and trailer recede toward the horizon
i have a very real prospect for getting laid
the lincoln and rv slow to a stop outside the home
they all stare at the empty space where the chevy nova used to be
jerry gets a smirk of satisfaction
you see that babe
jerry backs the rv into the drive as nick helps his mother with her belongings and they enter the house
the rv scrapes its way through a few overhanging tree branches before jerry decides its parked
there comes a womans scream from inside the house
jerry joins nick and estelle in the doorway
there in the living room surrounded by all the furniture pushed neatly against the walls is jerrys camouflaged chevy
i guess they didnt cave after all
jerry pops the hood and lets out a whistle
boy everythings complete
theres even water in the windshield washer
how did they ever get it in here
my front door cant be more than three feet wide
looks like they brought it in piece by piece and then reassembled it
but it would take an army of mechanics to do all that
jerry slams down the hood
or a navy babe
or a navy
a cab pulls up in front of the house and nicks sister joanie gets out of the back
she tips the driver and as she crosses the front yard gawks at the rv sitting in the drive
nicks door is ajar
nick pulls up his trousers and comes into the hall
he listens to the voices downstairs
he comes down the first few steps and is met with the sight of his mother and sister staring up at him
nick your sister came all the way from la for a weekend visit
nick and joanie meet eyes
she lifts a quizzical eyebrow
albert chews on jerrys sock under the table
can someone do something about the mutt
the family dines over take out fried chicken
jerry kicks albert and the puppy goes tumbling across the floor
i dont know jerry
can someone do something about the monstrosity dripping oil in my living room
yeah i noticed that
whats the story
jerry tried to outsmart a few sailors
its been an amusing saga
jerry contemplates smacking nick upside the head but decides against it when he discerns estelle is probably in her sons corner
ok babe i guess when i come back from my next haul ill just have to take it apart piece by piece
estelle takes a deep breath and tries to let the matter rest
up to anything scandalous these days nick
i was going to ask you the same thing
what do you mean
nick puffs out his chest
joanie looks down at her boob job
not that its any of your business but ive taken a class to improve my posture
nick rolls his eyes
i think joanie looks very nice
and she has a new boyfriend too
did you meet him in posture class
nick met a nice girl in ukiah
are you on each others myspace pages
sheeni believes the internet will be the end of literacy
so its to be a torturous snail mail exchange huh
more like the occassional collect call
and just who do you expect to pay for that
jerry kicks the dog away from his sock
albert growls and prepares for another charge
want to learn how a car is put together
auto mechanics doesnt interest me
see estelle i told you the kid was queer eeaaaahhhhh
jerry lurches backward in the chair and lands on the floor revealing that alberts teeth have a firm grasp on jerrys sack
the dog shakes the scrotum in his jaws
he tries to swipe albert with his beer bottle but the dog retreats into the house leaving jerry rolling around on the floor
joanie and nick exchange a smile
the phone rings
estelle gets up to answer it
nick put the dog in the basement
nick stoops to secure the leash around the piping
he regards the little pug
albert whimpers and cocks his head
the door at the top of the stairs opens and estelle descends the first few steps
nick that was your father on the phone
he lost his job
how unlike him
watch your smart mouth
this means the end of child support
youll have to start going to
oakland public school
in nicks eyes the fear of a sentence worse than death
morning comes through the drapes
the phone on the side table is ringing
nick emerges from his room and picks it up
will you accept a collect call from sheeni saunders
nick looks around opens the door to the linen closet and darts inside
then nick pulls the cord and the naked bulb kicks on
how are you
im well nickie
and how is trent
not too suicidal i hope
sheeni relaxes on a love seat cradling the phone with her shoulder as she eats grapes from a bowl
of course he was disconsolate but we talked all day and hes come to see this as an opportunity for growth
oh and nick trent wanted me to tell you that he bears you no ill will
nor i him
i wish him all the best
his parents are sending him to a french speaking boarding school this year
hes sure to get along there
so how is my darling albert
well though hes taken a disliking to jerry
and you nickie
how are you
i regret love of my life my father has lost his job and i will now be forced to go to public school
what did he do
hes a writer sort of
he writes advertising copy
pensive beat nick i suggest we look at your fathers firing as a blessing in disguise
i propose we get your father a job here in ukiah and you can come and live with him
not that im fond of ukiah but id live in a drainage culvert to be with you
now i happen to know progressive plywood is looking for an assistant editor
it would be perfect for your father
nick furrows his brow with skepticism
i had no idea you had knowledge of the employment opportunities of trade magazines
the owner is the father of a friend of mine
anyone i know
okay its trents father
so why would trent want to help my father move to ukiah
i told you darling
trent harbors you no ill will
i will have him call your father up pretending to be a head hunter
very well but i dont see how i am to live with him
my mother values my indentured servitude
you must influence her to send you away
i feel this will require being in a constant state of open revolt on your part
what do you want me to do
i propose you rent the film rebel without a cause as soon as possible
you must emulate james dean
close on her glossy lips
you must be bad nickie
be very very bad
a glint of resolve in nicks eyes
i will darling
and in pre lap comes the ding dong of the doorbell
joanie and nick sit in the chevy nova watching rebel without a cause through the windshield
estelle enters the living room with tears streaming down her face and a police officer lance wescott with a flattop watery red eyes and assorted guns flashlights and billy clubs
this is officer lance wescott
he has some bad news
after a beat nick rolls down the window
your mothers friend jerry had a heart attack in a bar in dallas
estelle sobs but isnt joined by her children
she turns to lance
will they be sending his belongings
im afraid theyve already been sent
to his wife
nick looks to joanie
they both look to their mother
she bursts into tears and collapses into officer lance wescotts arms
there there maam
its going to be okay
nick watches his mother sobbing against the cops chest for a beat before he rolls up the window and he and joanie resume watching the movie
estelles cries of despair become
the cries of ecstasy coming through the wall along with the repeated exclamation of lances name
nick rolls over in bed
he hauls himself out of bed
i have decided to create a supplementary persona named francois
he stands in front of the mirror and leans in
like a parisian james dean he will be bold reckless contemptuous of authority and irresistible to women
push in on his reflection as a moustache appears
then a beret and black and white striped shirt
then a cigarette holder and thompson machine gun
and francois is born
i think youll do nicely
oui i am ze perfect match pour une francophile for ze likes of sheeni saunders
i have ze calculating intelligence
the itchy trigger finger
francois cocks the machine gun
and cojone grandes
and cojone grandes
nick opens the door
lance and estelle shower behind the frosted glass
those hippos are taking a shower together
he slams the door
nick comes down the stairs
he reaches the water heater and starts spinning the knob
the forms of estelle and lance in the shower can be made out
they both start screaming as they are blasted with cold water
the blobs of their bodies press up against the glass
albert looks up at nick and lets out a bark
nick smiles and bends down to undo his leash
lance bursts from the bathroom in his boxers looking for blood
he hears the sound of paws climbing the stairs
albert comes hurtling around he corner almost losing his footing on the hardwood floor
as we lunge at lances crotch
a bloodcurdling scream rises up from the home
estelle hands lance an ice pack and he applies it to his injury
nick wanders in and takes his seat at the table
shes sleeping in
i dont think anyone got a wink last night with all that racket
lance looks at him seething inwardly
he glances to estelle
i thought there were laws in this city against illicit cohabitation
or are they just another big policemans joke
kid you are asking for trouble
what are you going to do
shoot me with your gun
lance lunges across the table
nickie go to your room
nick flings down his napkin and heads for the front door
where do you think youre going
the screen door slams behind him
the garage door rattles upward illuminating the cardboard box of paint supplies
nick bends down and picks up a can of aerosol spray paint
he shakes it
nick sprays the trailer in wide sweeping motions
joanie and nick sun bathe in the lawn chairs
estelle stands over them
what the in gods name has gotten into you
jerry paid good money for that trailer
and just what makes you so sure it was me
who the hell else would write such a thing
estelle gestures to the trailer which we can see has been defaced with the words gods perfect asshole
and just how do you explain this
she holds up a semi nude polaroid of lacey
and just who the hell is lacey
estelle stares at the photo face contorted by revulsion and envy
what are you doing with a picture like this of your fathers girlfriend
cmon mom all boys his age have pictures like that to
when i want your opinion on raising my child ill ask for it
to nick morbidly and whats this lacey tart like
well she likes fast cars and takes a lot of naps with dad
super true she likes to sit on dads lap while he eats and blow in his ear
super not true and she calls him thunder rod and he calls her sugar puss
super true believe it or not at this point estelle has turned bright red
you are confined to your room until school starts you sick pervert
she stalks off
joanie glances over at nick with amusement
i wish i was leaving with you tonight
your day will come
i never thought mine would but it did
was all that stuff about lacey and dad made up
did you really take a posture class
i wanted them all my life
a knock on the door
lefty enters the room and nick pulls the headphones off his ears
whats with your mom nick
she gave me the third degree just to come up here
i vandalized jerrys trailer and she found my picture of lacey
well good thing i stole this from the bookstore then
lefty unzips his backpack and produces a large hardbound volume titled lovemaking for advanced gourmets
i was reading it all last night
boy having sex is a lot more complicated than i thought
did you know you were supposed to stick your pinkie in her bumhole
no way man
here i got the page marked
lefty flops down on the sofa next to nick and the two of them flip through the manual
yeah but im not sure i should try this on sheeni
i think this book is for people whove been married so long theyre disgusted by the sight of each other
they regard the illustrated figures of men and women in various states of foreplay
are we really supposed to be that
i think these illustrations are disproportionate for emphasis
maybe we should compare
perhaps we should
just for the sake of research
nick and lefty get to their feet and stand opposite each other like a pair of duelists
they simultaneously undo their belts and pull their pants and underwear to their feet
leftys eyes fall to nicks crotch
he gets a hint of concern in his expression
nick stares at leftys tilting his head to compensate for the curvature
the door behind them opens and estelle appears toting nicks lunch
she lets out a scream
the boys turn to face her pants around their ankles
she hurls the tray of food at them
nick hastily tries to pull up his pants as his mother chases him around the room grabbing up objects and hurling them his way
lefty emerges from the room and takes off
you wont get away
im calling your parents
nick bursts from the room desperately trying to buckle his pants
estelle is hot on his heels wielding the hardbound sex manual as they round the bannister
in my house
how dare you
she catches up to nick at the top of the stairs and cracks him upside the head
he loses his balance and goes tumbling down the staircase letting out a moan that stutters as his head hits each step
he comes crashing into the foyer landing on the slate
nick watches out the window
estelle can be seen animatedly describing the events to leftys parents
lefty glances up at nick and gives a pained expression
nick lays on his belly reading no exit
he looks up when he hears the sound of footsteps in the hall
shadows appear beneath the crack in the door
estelle opens the door and looks down at him
nick i just want you to know that ive thought about it and ive accepted that you are gay
thanks a pantsful but im not gay
if youre really concerned though i suggest you get me a room at the ukiah motel
if anyone can straighten me out its sheeni
she looks at him dubiously and hands out the phone
that sounds more like a job for your father
here he wants to talk to you
nick takes the phone from her hands and she closes the door
into phone hello
so whats this i hear about you being gay
george sprawls on the couch cradling the phone with one hand and holding a beer on his stomach with the other
whats this i hear about you being unemployed
yes but my condition is only temporary
i can change it
i hope you do
we need the money
nick there are more important things in life than money
i know dad
like getting a good education
and being able to respect your parents
ive got two words for you
he hangs up the phone
intimidating punk music
school bus doors fold open and nick steps off
the music pounds from the boom box resting on the hood of the mustang gt where a pack of skinheads follow nick with their eyes
nick walks past them glancing over at the assembly of asian gangsters glaring at him from their perch on the wall
nick pushes past a fight where two kids throw each other against the lockers
he smiles at a pair of punk rock girls
one of them flips him off
nick heads into
and as nick steps into the bathroom we follow his eyes
a crip selling a bag of dope to a goth freshman
a latin king vandalizing the wall with the words swish to
a pack of wiggers as one of them gives the others a butterfly knife show and tell
we drift down the corridor where nick dials at a pay phone
office of child welfare
my name is nick
my fathers name is george twisp
has he hit you nick
but hes missed several child support payments and is not looking for work
so now im going to public school in oakland
not the oakland schools
and hes had an offer from a respectable publication in ukiah
dont you worry young man
ill get right on this
well light a fire under that deadbeat
nick walks albert down the sidewalk
lefty crosses the street to him and they walk together
hows it hangin
youll never believe who called me nick
she just called and asked if i wanted to hang out tonight
i didnt want to ask why
i need to find someplace for us to get it on
albert squats to poop in someones yard
the boys pause to wait for him
you can use my house if you want
my mom and lance are going to a movie and im planning on stealing jerrys trailer and torching it in a parking lot so youll have the whole house to
albert finishes his business and they resume walking
so where you headed anyway
my parents are making me see a shrink now
he asking lots of weird questions
you bet your left nut he is
he asked if i had any lustful thoughts toward my sister
what did you tell him
i told him about beating off once with her brassiere
what did you tell him that for
you dont know what its like
i think they release chemicals in their office to make you tell the truth
sounds like a professional
he must be very expensive
i wouldnt know
the bill goes to your house
my mom is paying for your therapy
i guess so
it was your cyclops i was staring at
yes but it was your idea
gee maybe i am gay
dont be retarded
we were doing research for our girlfriends
thats a relief
so youll leave the door open
yeah just dont blow your load on my sheets
thanks a pantsful nick
dont mention it
see ya lefty
nick hunches over his desk doing homework headphones over his ears
estelle knocks and enters
nick pulls the headphones down around his neck
lance and i are walking down to the movie theater
theres tv dinners in the freezer
oh and nick your father got a job in ukiah
do you think it might be a good idea if i moved in with him
nick that just wouldnt work
i depend on that child support money to eat
but shouldnt you depend on the child support money for you know
watch your smart mouth
she slams the door
the plan is simple
nick places two full cannisters of gasoline into the trunk of the lincoln
nicks behind the wheel backing up the car
tow jerrys trailer to a remote parking lot in berkeley and burn it to the ground
the hitch ball grinds under the trailer socket
thus evicting myself from my mothers clutches and into the arms of my one and only love
nick fires up the v engine and shifts into drive pulling forward
he cuts across the lawn
francois wanted to torch the trailer where it sits but ive convinced him a parking lot will reduce the risk of collateral damage
the trailer clips the corner of the house
chunks of stucco fall and the galvanized downspout shudders and writhes collapsing the long rain gutter running across the front of the home
nick guns it and with a lurch the trailer splinters free
he dodges the birch tree but plows over the smaller asian pear
the lincoln bounces the curb and catapults into the street the trailer weaving back and forth smashing parked cars
nick cruises along sedately
he plays with the radio and settles on the sex pistols
he looks up just in time to see the red light and slams on the brakes nearly jack knifing the trailer
the light turns green and the car lumbers up the long hill
nick hits the bump in the road right before the stop sign
the car bottoms out
the trailer bounces up coming unhitched
nick hits the gas and the lincoln suddenly surges forward released from the great weight
behind him through the rear window the trailer can be seen receding into the distance
he glances into the mirror and spots the trailer plunging down the hill
then he crashes into the fiat parked in front of him at the intersection
the gas tank on the fiat cracks spurting fuel onto the pavement
nick leaps from the lincoln and watches open mouthed as the vehicular ballet unfolds
down the hill the speeding trailer sideswipes a delivery van and goes into a spin
the bohemians sipping espresso at the outdoor cafe look up to see the words gods perfect asshole bearing down on them
the delivery van veers out of control
the bohemians scatter
the truck runs over a fire hydrant and smashes its way through the patio furniture and into the cafe
a geyser of water plumes where the hydrant once stood
the trailer resumes its downward plunge toward the busy cross street below
nick turns to see the still restive lincoln part from the fiat and begin to roll down the hill after its partner
i forgot to set the brake
the driver of the fiat bolts after the accelerating lincoln but as he realizes the futility slows to a jog
the driver turns to see he forgot to set his own brake and desperately rolls out of the way of the fiat
motorists slam on their brakes as the speeding trailer crosses four lanes of traffic
it jumps the curb crashing into the plate glass window of a gourmet sausage shop
a cop car lights up and speeds into the intersection just in time to get clipped by the lincoln
the cop car goes into a tail spin smashing into a chicken transport
the flock of feathered inmates fly for freedom
the lincoln continues to generate momentum on its slalom run thundering past the stopped cars and into the wrecked building like a runaway express train
the gas cannisters in the trunk ignite and the sausage shop explodes the trailers two propane tanks going off like bombs
the fiat comes flying into the flaming mess and blasts apart sending shards of metal and sausage links to go raining down on the spectators
the blaze lights the trail of gasoline left by the broken fuel tank and a stream of liquid fire races up the hill ending at nicks feet
nick takes a moment to watch in horror as dark plumes of smoke billow into the sky the geyser of water the storm of dazed chickens
he turns around and does his best to inconspicuously walk out of frame
we follow nick as he comes through the front door and is met with the sight of his mother and lance staring at him from the kitchen table
the berkeley fire rages on the television
how was the movie
you little shit
you stole your mothers dead ex boyfriends trailer and set a five million dollar fire
i refuse to stand for such allegations
they have a description of the arsonist
lance flips through his notebook and reads
a white teenage male about five seven
a hundred and twenty five pounds dark hair spotted complexion
that could be anyone
he was also wearing a tee shirt with the words im single lets mingle
nick glances down at the lettering on his shirt
estelle bursts into tears
what am i going to do
my only son will be sent to prison
lance takes estelle in his arms and smirks at nick
oh lance cant something be done
tell you what estelle
ill make out that nick reported the car and trailer stolen before the fire
itll be less suspicious
but i could take some serious heat for this
how can i possibly repay you
ill think of something estelle
he gives her ass a playful squeeze
she lets out a giggle
now the kid better not be here when the detectives start coming around
id send him away for a while
a long while
he can go make his fathers life miserable
nick suddenly brightens
but i like it here
youre going buster
she snatches up the phone and dials
georges groggy voice can be heard answering
estelle screams into the phone
youre son just burned down half of berkeley
come and get the little brat
wait a minute estelle arent you going to punish him
id say he deserves a good hiding
cupping the squawking hes too much for me anymore
can you do it lance darling
lance gives nick another smirk
nick lets out a yelp of pain as lance brings a broken tree limb against his bare bottom
i dont scream much
i am making a painful sacrifice for the woman of my dreams
my suffering possesses a beauty which elevates it above this sordid scene
with the final blow the tree limb cracks in half
nick looks over his shoulder
are you through
lance looks around the room
picks up an umbrella and considers it in his hand
nick hangs his head
we find nick waiting in the drive with a pile of suitcases beside him
nick finds lefty lurking in the shrubs that divide his mothers lawn from the neighbors
he limps to his friend
i was wondering what happened to you
did you get to blow your wad
i did not get to blow my wad
did you get interrupted
whats worse than being interrupted
millie is a lesbian
the only reason she wanted to hang out with me is because she heard that i showed you my slinky and thought i was gay too
i didnt have a great night either
well i dunno what youre gonna do but im giving suicide serious consideration this time
or you could just fake it and then hide out in ukiah with me
then later come back and maybe millie filbert will boink you out of pity
hey thats not a bad idea
thanks a pantsful nick
a pair of headlights swing into the drive and lefty ducks out of sight
the headlights turn out to belong to george twisps the drivers side window rolls down to reveal nicks dad
lacey leans over georges seat to wave at nick through the window and show him some of her cleavage
the trunk pops open
is there any way i could sit up front with lacey dad
moms boyfriend beat me pretty badly
in this car faggots get the back seat
nick is in the back crowded in by his belongings and albert
they ride in tense silence until they pass the sight of the fire where fire fighters sift through the ash
look what youve done
lacey turns to look at nick over the seat
they share a smile
morning peers over the distant hills
the bmw pulls into the drive of the house a plywood rectangle perched on cement blocks
a swamp cooler on the shallow pitched roof
they all emerge from the car
go ahead and bring your stuff inside
lacey and i need a nap
cmon sugar puss
nick watches longingly as george leads lacey into the home
as he places his hand on laceys ass he looks back over his shoulder and throws a smug look in nicks direction
what a competitive asshole
nick reaches the door and gently knocks
but its sheenis ogre of a father who answers the door and stares at nick sternly
is sheeni available
she most certainly is not
as a matter of fact weve banned you from her life nick twisp
trent preston informed us that not only were you moving here to pursue my daughter but that youre not even mentally handicapped and thus molested my wife in the shower
of sound mind and body
that rat fink fuck
you watch your language
this is a christian home
were sending sheeni to les ecole des arts and literatures in santa cruz
but shell be miserable without me
were in love
the ogre snorts in condescending amusement
then i guess its a good thing trent is going there too
shell have someone to console her
and with that mr
saunders slams the door so hard in nicks face that the entire two story mobile home rocks back and forth
nick makes his way past the arbor crestfallen
sheeni emerges from the shadows in a hooded sweatshirt over a lavender dress
nick lights up at the sight of her and they embrace
they kiss passionately
he works his way to her neck and starts to reach under the sweatshirt
i had to sneak away just to see you
i had to burn down half of berkley
that was you
nick are you out of your mind
i felt a grand gesture was required darling
sheenis expression indicates that she is touched but it turns to troubled
nick trent betrayed us
francois will kill him later
the point is we must elope
sheeni takes a step back at the notion
i dont know nick
i do love you but i dont want to spend the rest of our lives on the run
its a small price to pay
she takes another step back
i cant nick
i just dont get it
alberts here too
i know nick and ive been longing for you so
but well just have to find another way
the car is already packed
nick nods glumly and sheeni seems overcome with remorse
nick twisp i will not allow you to accept defeat so easily
sheeni contd when the time is right you must make your way to santa cruz
and then we will make love
nick lifts his gaze with renewed determination
or we could consummate here in the woods
did you bring the consumer reports
nick just blinks blankly
then it will have to be santa cruz
i really must go now darling
i love you
i love you too
squeeze darling albert for me
she pulls her hood over her head
nick watches wistfully as she slips away into the forest
i have endured a five million dollar beating for nothing
i have been stabbed
stabbed in the back
two wrestlers slam down onto the mat below us
i do not have a friend within a hundred miles
this is a daunting thought if you think about it
we track down the row of other students starting with a three hundred pound behemoth
the row seems to descend in weight class until we reach nick at the very end
nick does his best to not be pinned by dwayne crampton who out weighs him by at least pounds
nick rinses off
dwayne steps up to the shower head next to his
nick glances his way and quickly recoils at the repelling landscape of rolling pink flab
sorry bout wompin ya
why do you suppose guys got only two testicles when we got ten fingers and toes
i could not begin to speculate
nick turns off his shower and slinks away
nick comes up the dusty road toting his backpack
on the porch of the saunders home a handsome but somewhat unkempt paul saunders mid twenties blows cool jazz on a beat up trumpet
im paul sheenis brother
nick comes up the path to meet him
how did you know my name
no we havent
in a previous life
paul begins rolling a joint
nice fire in berkeley
did sheeni tell you that was me
she didnt have to
was i an arsonist in a previous life
but sheeni was
what did she burn
men and boys
paul hands the joint out to nick
he regards it dubiously
an empty hallway
psychedelic sound plays
nick comes around the corner literally floating down the hall
he breaststrokes through the air toward us
he passes just under the door frame and comes down feet touching carpet
he looks into the mirror and finds francois lounging on the bed behind him
my god francois
what was paul smoking
shut up and go with it
nick shrugs and opens the top dresser drawer revealing laceys lingerie
nick starts dancing doing a strip tease for himself
we pan around the room and when we reach nick again hes wearing nothing but a pair of laceys thongs
he models in front of the mirror regarding his bulging t
he removes a c cup bra and holds it high
he uses the elastic straps to fasten the bra onto his head
he starts dancing up a storm to the cheesy vengaboys rendition of brazil in his head
bicycling leg movements
as he backs up we can see that george is watching him from the doorway a safeway bag in his arms
lacey peers over his shoulder
the music halts abruptly
what the hell
nick gives a startled jump
is that my bra
nick sits at the table considerably more clothed and sober
george works on a jug of zin
were calling that fruitcake display strike one
two more strikes and its back to oakland
the front door opens and mrs
crampton enters with safeway bags of her own
dwayne follows close behind her
albert barks and jumps at dwaynes feet
what are you doing here
aint ya heard
were gonna be roommates
aint that zinky
nick looks to his father in horror as dwayne goes chasing after the dog
dwayne get yer dumb ass back here and take yer sleepin pill
you must be nick
wash yer hands boy
i dont serve two shifts
whats going on
cramptons our new housekeeper
im renting out the spare room to her seeing as her camper has been deemed unfit for human habitation
what about dwayne
hes bunking with you
you working on strike two
nick leans back and glares in silent protest as everyone takes their seats at the table
nick tries to shut out the sound of dwayne getting into the creaky bed behind him
you wanna sleep in bed with me
itll be tons warmer
no thank you dwayne
a knock at the door
this came for you nick
nick sits up in bed to receive the letter
as lacey leaves he tears through the wax seal and unfolds its contents
is it a love letter nick
i dont know its in french
say why does your mother give you sleeping pills
cuz otherwise id stay up all night playin nintendo wii
say nick can i walk albert
i dont know
dogs dont grow on trees
but it will cost you one sleeping pill per walk
whatchu want them pills for nick
you never know when sedatives will come in handy
nick emerges from the home
he makes his way down the road
he stops at the familiar sight of my green haven
he gets an amused smile and sighs with nostalgia
the front door of the trailer opens and lefty emerges
nick furrows his brow in confusion as lefty locks the door and comes down the path
lefty what are you doing here
i live here
the guys only charging me fifty in cash a month
i mean what are you doing in town
i did what you told me nick
i threw my backpack off the pier and reported my own suicide
i even left a note
wow lefty im kinda impressed
faking your suicide is pretty ballsy
lefty joins nick in his walk down the road
so where you headed
redwood high school
can i come
why would you want to go to school if you didnt have to
its weird nick but school seems like a pretty fun place to hang out once you get rid of classes and homework
i can see this stunt really has liberated your mind
im telling you nick killing myself was the best thing that ever happened to me
a rowdy cafeteria
lefty and nick dine in the corner
nick has an open french textbook as he tries to decipher sheenis letter
an indian boy vijay joshi makes his way to them
may i sit at your table
im lefty and this is nick
i am vijay joshi
vijay sits and shakes their hands
i see you both have been rejected by the socially elite of our school
ukiah is a cultural wasteland compared to india
though some of the girls are very attractive
do you have a girlfriend
not at the moment
but i am optimistic
how about you
yes but she transferred
you dont mean sheeni saunders
i heard she was interested in some brilliant fellow in the bay area
hey thats you nick
you are not at all what i imagined
nick narrows his eyes
so how is sheeni
i dont know
she sent me this letter
but its in french
shall i translate it for you
you speak french
i speak french english hindi marathi and urdu
that must come in handy
nick hands over the letter and vijay starts reading it silently
he chuckles as he reads and nick squints his eyes at him in annoyance
vijay picks up on it clears his throat and reads aloud
in nicks imagination sheeni puts pen to paper at her desk which affords a view of the sun setting on the ocean
i am writing you from my room in santa cruz
surprisingly boarding school has proven to be a welcome liberation as well as
a stimulating experience which i am now not so quick to change
sheeni slips into a nightgown as other girls walk around scantily clad behind her
perhaps you should consider learning french and enrolling
sheeni chats up a gathering of handsome boys in the hall
they regard her lustfully
english cannot be spoken on campus even if you are hemorrhaging from an accidental limb amputation
i have made friends with the head of the girls basketball team
her name is heather and despite her popularity she is saving herself for college boys
heather a slender giantess poses with the other members of the basketball team for a yearbook photo
i have an interesting roommate from new york named taggarty
taggarty short dark hair intense green eyes manhattan sophistication cloaked in fragile ripeness snaps a polaroid of a sleepy boy
she has already slept with seventeen boys and hopes to rack up fifty before leaving here
taggarty tacks the picture to a wall covered with polaroids
she writes the boys grade c beneath his image
the distant figure on the windsurf board can only be trent
trent has taken up windsurfing and has been designated target number one by all the girls
i am still very angry at him for the betrayal but he claims he wants to mend our friendship
the figure falls into the surf and the crowd of watching bikini clad girls gasp in horror
i guess we shall see
all in all im happy and look forward to further growth in this rich intellectual environment
vijay sets down the letter
nick waits a beat staring in disbelief
nothing else about me
vijay picks up the letter again
love to you and albert
setting down the letter whos albert
albert is our dog
this is a disaster
what the hell does she mean trent wants to mend the relationship
i dont know but this taggarty girl sounds very uninhibited
i wonder if shes made it with a hindu yet
heather sounds like a babe
you think if i grew a beard id pass for college age
ive got to get to sheeni as soon as possible
if i dont trent preston is going to mindfuck her into thinking she doesnt like me
and then hell probably fuck her in other ways
did you know youre supposed to put your pinkie in a girls bumhole vijay
will you shut up and help me out
what should we do
i suggest we steal my fathers bmw and take a trip to santa cruz
vijay youll have to be our translator
but what will we tell our parents
you can tell your father you are staying at nicks house for the weekend
and visa versa
but what if we are caught
to hell with it vijay
its time to take action
the jingle as nick removes his dads keys from the bureau
the trunk slamming closed with the sleeping bags inside
the roar of the engine as vijays hand turns the key in the ignition
as vijay drives lefty holds up a road map in the back seat
nick places a cd in the stereo and take five fills the car
what is this music nick
its dave brubeck
to vijay i thought a person as cultured as yourself would appreciate it
you want culture
i will give you culture
vijay puts in his own cd and ravi shankars tarana blasts from the speakers
nick gives vijay a grin of approval
music plays over
we fly through the forest to keep up with the beamer
the bmw passes cars on the golden gate bridge
the beamer navigates the winding curves of the highway where green hills meet the pacific ocean
the car pulls to a stop in the parking lot the school looming beyond slightly obfuscated by a light drizzle
the music cuts out with the engine
the grouping of boys part as we move through them
finally we reach the center of their attention
sheeni taggarty and heather standing together in their coats
nick vijay and lefty are noticeably shorter than the older boys around them
to taggarty and heather hi im nick
so youre nick
weve heard so much about you
and this is vijay
and this is lefty
lefty goes to usc
and im not gay
nick i knew youd come
sheeni glances over at the disapproving matron
she leans in close
but you must wait in the car until we can sneak you in
nick nods in understanding
an empty hall
the sneaky strings of night on bald mountain
sheeni rounds the corner at the far end
as she and heather sneak the boys down the other occupants of the floor giggle in french and dart from door to door in near undress
a cement cubicle just big enough for a bunk bed two small desks an army surplus dresser and a stuffed armchair
sheeni pulls a nightgown from the dresser
lefty should maybe sleep in my room
its pretty crowded in here
your roommate wont mind
oh darlene went home for the weekend
lefty gulps and picks up his grip
he pauses in the hallway
well see you guys in the morning
the door closes and vijay and nick exchange a knowing glance
pardon me everyone
sheeni steps into the tiny closet to change
vijay and nick regard the
a series of mug shots of sullen looking teenage boys
most of them have been given a grade of c or below
theres your competition
a distinguished group i would be happy to join
the two boys turn around and watch in hot blooded bliss as taggarty searches for her misplaced nightie
the two boys brush their pearlies over the grungy sink
i am in a state of sexual frenzy
what is your plan
we drape a blanket over the lower bunk for sheeni and me
you tackle taggarty on the top bunk
heres a condom
i slipped two to lefty leaving us with four
what if they dont go for it
theyll go for it
you can cut the sexual tension in that room with a knife
dont be silly darling
not with others in the room
leaning in to whisper we must wait until everyone falls asleep
nick tries to appear unconcerned
she gives him a kiss and climbs into her narrow bed
as nick and vijay prepare their sleeping bags on the floor they watch taggarty climb up to her bunk in the sky
do you need the light on to take off your clothes
flipping off the light we can find our zippers in the dark
a beat of blackness
then a light tap at the door
there is the sound of sheeni getting out of bed
she cracks the door letting in just enough light from the hall that a male shadow gets cast across the two boys on the floor
nick squints and tries to hear what sheeni and the male shadow are whispering to each other
after a beat sheeni closes the door and the room plunges into blackness once again
nick listens as sheeni climbs back into bed as if nothing happened
was that the matron
then who was it
it was trent
did you say it was trent
he came to discuss our friendship
i told him now was not the time
so where is trent now
i assume he went back to the boys dorm
now really nickie you are keeping everyone awake with your inquiries
though silence follows we take a moment to allow nicks mind to race in the dark
he stands and looks at the mirror above the dresser
francois can be made out sitting by the window in the moonlight stroking the thompson
now is our chance
chance for what
to confront our nemesis
we must go to the boys dorm and kill trent where he sleeps
i suppose we should at least get a look at him
to see what were dealing with
stubbing out his you see what we are dealing with
and zen i wll deal wiz it
and with that he cocks the thompson for dramatic flare
nick emerges from the room in nothing but his underwear and a whindbreaker
he creeps down the hall
the school security van crawls by in the background a searchlight sweeping the grounds
the moment it is out of sight nick darts from the bushes of the girls dorm and races across the campus to the boys dorm
nick makes his way down the hall checking the names on the colored paper cut out shapes that adorn the doors
he stops and backtracks when he spots the door that boasts the names trent and ed
nick knocks on the door
it opens inward to reveal a bare chested hulking athlete in a pajama pants
this is ed solomon
who the hell are you
i am nick twisp
oh so youre nick
is trent here
you just missed him nick
he just grabbed a couple condoms and left
did he say where he was going
i think he said he was going to heathers room
but thats where lefty is
who are you
oh so youre ed
whats that supposed to mean
its just that sheeni mentioned trent has a thing for a guy named ed and that he touches the guy when he falls asleep
but obviously if that were you youd know about it
must be a different ed solomon
take care now
nick takes off running and ed stares after him
the security van continues to make its rounds
we find nick crouching behind the steps to the boys dorm
he pulls the hood of his windbreaker over his head and takes a deep breath
as the searchlight passes by he makes a break for it
track with nick as he darts from one form of cover to the next perhaps accompanied by the imagined sounds of mortar blasts and machine gun turret fire
at long last he reaches the girls dorm undetected
nick bangs on the door
heather answers in little more than a g string and nick seems to forget his mission just long enough to appreciate her body
whats up nick
is trent in there
what happened to lefty
im right here nick
nick peers past heather where he finds lefty standing naked in the moonlight
trent was here but he left
he only dropped by to lend us a couple more condoms
but i gave lefty two already
yes and that was very generous of you but the night is young
so what is trent the fucking condom faerie
you can have one of ours nick
if you need one
the fact that nick doesnt yet raises his temperament even further
so where did he say he was going
he didnt say but im pretty sure i just saw him go into our bathroom down the hall
oh and id be careful with those condoms
trents roommate ed said that trent pokes holes in them so that he can get sheeni pregnant and be with her forever
and with that piece of disturbing info he leaves them
there is the clap of thunder outside as nick throws open the door to the girls bathroom
he looks around with murderous rage
there comes the sound of someone vomiting
nick kicks in the stall and finds bernice lynch a thin platinum haired girl with six earrings per lobe
she hurls into the toilet again and turns around to find nick
who are you
im sheenis friend nick
sorry to disturb you
it was something i ate
so wait are you sheenis boyfriend
my names bernice
not that you asked
nice to meet you bernice
actually i think trent preston mentioned you
he said you were frumpy but now that ive met you i can see trent is a lying bastard
and trent can go to hell for all i care
you dont like sheeni
personally i hate her guts
well pardon me nick
i feel like throwing up some more now
you didnt happen to see trent preston did you
she waves him away as she bends over the sink to hurl again
then lifts her face and smiles through the dripping bile
i did actually
i think he was on his way to sheenis room
nicks eyes widen in alarm
nick enters the dark room to the sound of the bed squeaking
vijay and taggarty grunt away on the top bunk
he watches the moon lit forms thumping together
he turns his attention to the sleeping beauty on the bottom bunk
he moves toward her
she blinks waking and smiles at the sight of him
was trent here
nick hangs his head
but i sent him away again
nick stares into her eyes to discern her honesty but he finds nothing but adoration
because i want you darling
not even trent can match the industriousness and tenacity with which you have pursued me
nick smiles too
she reaches out to pull him into her bed as
the door to the room slams open and they are suddenly backlit by the harsh beam of the matrons flashlight
qest que cest passer ici
nick bolts upright smacking his head against the top bunk
he lands on the floor where he gets a view of
trent standing behind the matron
the blinding light makes his features difficult to make out but his white teeth are definitely smiling diabolically
the boys come out of the front door of the dormitory the matron flanked by school security guards hot on their heels
the girls in the dorm appear on the balcony in droves cheering the boys escape
vijays pants fall to his ankles tripping him up
nick and lefty grab vijay by the arms and pull him up again as if he were a wounded war buddy in a retreat from the vietnamese army
they reach the beamer at the edge of the grounds
nick gets in first
lefty dives through the back window legs kicking
vijay slams the door just as the matron and her security team catches up to them
the authorities bang on the windows as nick peels out
indian pop blares from the car
they speed off into the night
lefty lets out a holler of joy
i did it three times
two long ones and a quickie
how about you vijay
it was difficult to tell with that condom nick
why did you buy such thick ones
that brand was top rated by consumers
well shes safe
no organism could penetrate those walls
you think the girls are in trouble
they will likely notify their parents
perhaps even expel them
then sheeni will have to come back to ukiah
the car sputters
nicks eyes go to the gas gauge
the rain is coming down again
nick shivers in his underwear
vijay isnt in much more and leftys sheet is drenched
what will we do
well we cant stay in the car
sooner or later highway patrol is going to come by and ask for our non existent drivers license
but we have no money
i have no shoes
ill catch pneumonia and die a indeterminate proto quasi virgin
a couple coins are inserted into a roadside pay phone
there is ringing on the other end
into phone mom
im sorry to wake you but im hoping youll help your only son
especially seeing as it would really piss off dad
a long beat
where are you nick
the three boys are still standing in the rain by the pay phone
the three of them huddle under their only windbreaker
a pair of headlights appear in the rain
the headlights flash twice and nick runs out into the road
nick waving frantically in nothing but tightie whities
the truck pulls to a stop and the passenger door opens to reveal the driver a man named wally rumpkin a seven foot tall giant in a plaid shirt and
he looks down at our three waylaid adventurers
but is one of you nick twisp
the two other boys exchange confused glances not entirely if this is how people go missing
im a friend of your moms
nick nods not yet sure whether or not this gentle giant is actually blushing with shyness or red with agitation at being sent on a midnight mission
so uhm uh
your mom says you need a ride
did i mention im a friend
nick breaks into a smile
finally the gods have cut him a break
wally and estelle watch the three semi clothed boys shovel in fried liver with no complaint
wally was a friend of jerrys
he came to help me in my time of mourning
what happened to lance
estelles face registers none of your business but a kind look from wally and she softens
lance is busy training to be a detective
he isnt around as much as he used to be
nick nods and goes back to eating
rumpkin is very smart
ask him a question nick
rumpkin what famous actress was married to frank sinatra artie shaw and mickey rooney
whoever she is she sure gets around
estelle smiles with pride
nick and the other boys regard the gentle giant with admiration
he bashfully averts his eyes
you should see what he did with the living room
nick and the other two boys pause in the doorway
where once the chevy occupied the space the living room was now fairly returned to its normal uncluttered state with all the furniture placed back in the original positions
at some point wally must have sawed a hole in the wall shared by the living and dining areas because the chevy now occupies that hole and has been painted
and decorated such that it has achieved an almost seamless blend with the wall
estelle goes and takes a seat on the couch
go ahead wally
wally blushes before he flips a switch and the tail lights come on giving the living room a warm flattering glow
wally flips another switch and the cars radio turns on
wally makes a slightly embarrassed gesture of scratching his head before lumbering over to the couch and taking a seat next to estelle
nick watches as wally puts his arm around his mother and they listen to the chevy play them elvis love me tender
the two adults snuggle in the glow of the tail lights and it brings an unexpected rush of caring in his expression
the truck rumbles to a stop and the three boys climb out
nick looks over his shoulder at wally blushing behind the wheel of the truck
it was nice meeting you nick
you too mr
wally blushes even more
he closes the door and starts to turn the truck around
nick watches him go
wally waves goodbye
nick turns and the three boys make their way down the dusty road
lacey works up a sweat to billy blank
nick comes through the door
hes still in his underwear
in the bedroom
i wouldnt bother him nick
hes in a foul mood
hes on with the police
apparently someone broke in and stole his beamer
lacey gives nick an amused smile
get in here
lacey rolls her eyes and heads for the bedroom
nick sits down with dwayne at the breakfast table
nick you got a girlfriend
yes i do
if you asked your girlfriend as a favor would she do it with me
guys dont share their girlfriends
i get ya
youre worried cause your girlfriend might get knocked up
what if i pull out nick
nick seethes inwardly
there comes a ruckus from the back bedroom and lacey emerges
its not my fault you tight assed critical nonfeeling sexist drunk
sticks and stones
it doesnt bother me if you sleep on the couch from now on
does it bother you that youre a selfish uptight boring lover
you forgot lousy driver
george appears in the doorway
thats strike two jerkoff
nick hangs his head
george moves about the kitchen chugging from a jug of zin
lacey picks up the ringing phone
lacey hangs up the phone
they found your car in davenport george
go pick it up
look whos wearing the pants this morning
lacey takes a seat next to nick and sighs
nick i feel for you
it must be tough being a teenager in this house
my mother wasnt any better
your mom has had a difficult time
she has had a great deal to put up with
im starting to appreciate that now
are you by any chance referring to me
if the shoe fits suck on it
george swills some zin and mumbles ominously
well see whos sucking on what soon
i spoke with taggarty this morning
she requested a wallet sized photo
nick looks up glumly from his lunch
lefty has his feet up on the table his facial growth is almost respectable
that makes it official
welcome to the club
nick narrows his eyes at the two non virgins
what grade did you receive
which i feel is perfectly satisfactory given the conditions
i guess this means theyre not being expelled
no apparently they convinced the matron it was all quite innocent
are you kidding
she had her flashlight trained on your hindi boner
lefty and vijay seem taken aback by the outburst
no need to be jealous nick
nick stands and collects his lunch tray
if im to get sheeni expelled and sent back to me i will need a partner in crime
nick enters the computer lab and finds an open machine
luckily francois has a girl on the inside
nick begins typing and speaking out loud
dear bernice it was nice meeting you this weekend in the bathroom
bernice reads the letter
i just want you to know i now see why you loath sheeni saunders so strongly
sheeni taggarty and heather sit across from the headmaster as the matron describes the events
i too have come to despise the snooty pretentious brunette and in all honesty you should probably get her expelled
i am happy to help in that regard
i have included a number of sleeping pills with this note
bernice dumps the pills from the envelope
you must introduce one of these into her breakfast beverage each day
bernice sits next to sheeni despite the fact shes being ignored
bernice drops a pill into sheenis coffee nonchalantly
sheeni watches the instructor
she may be intelligent but she is not likely to pass her courses when shes falling asleep in class
sheenis head slips off her hand as she drifts off
we move across the classroom to where bernice scribbles in her notebook
since meeting you i have come to realize my interest in sheeni was only a transient adolescent infatuation
i like you more than i can say
together we will outsmart these cake eaters
a view of the notebook shows her to be scribbling nicks name with hearts
she flips through pages of obsession
nicks fingers fly across the keys
he looks pleased with himself
affectionately yours nick
he looks around for observers looks back at the screen pensively and resumes typing
please destroy this note immediately
as nick deposits his letter
nick wanders up the drive
we follow him into the house
where he comes upon the sight of paul giving lacey a foot message on the couch
daddy is in davenport
where you left his car
we saved you some mushrooms nick
nick watches the sensual foot message
he picks up the bag full of mushrooms and considers them
nick pukes his guts into the sink
nicks in bed reading lovemaking for advanced gourmets
he glances up at dwayne playing nintendo and scowls
there comes the strange warbled sound of a trumpet from the next room and it is joined by other instruments until we hear the nutley brass rendition of i want
to be sedated
nick furrows his eyebrows in confusion
as the nude figures suddenly become animated making wonderful love
nick follows them with his eyes as they float off the page
we follow nick as he follows the nude figures who do acrobatics down
where lacey watches paul blow on his trumpet
the phone rings
get the phone
nick picks up the phone and paul takes his place at laceys feet
into phone hello
george cradles the cell phone
is that you
i am nick twisp
i am alive
i am a breathing organism
quit fooling around nick
this is your dad
is everything okay there
dont be afraid dad
everything will be okay
you deserve to be loved
what the hell is that supposed to mean
is lacey there
lacey is here
paul is caressing her toes
who the hell is paul
paul is our friend
he makes beautiful music for the acrobats
is lacey naked
dont be afraid dad
he hangs up the phone and pulls out the cord
he joins paul in working laceys feet
dad is afraid
he is on the wrong path
i have felt that for some time
nick watches the headlights from the arriving bmw travel across the walls
they go out
he listens to the front door being keyed followed by his father bellowing
nick gets up and wanders into
where paul stands between george and lacey
okay george just calm down
george lunges and paul socks him in the eye dropping him to the floor
you are in serious trouble
youve assaulted me and i know for a fact that you two were having naked orgies with my son
that child is only twelve years old
george gets to his feet
im sixteen dad
shut your pie hole
turning to lacey and that boy is an underaged minor
im going to have you arrested and charged with child molesting
dont be an idiot george
no one was naked
when you get out of prison you will both have to register as sex offenders
you will never be able to get a decent job again
ive never had a decent job
i dont think id want one
lets go paul
george ill pick up the rest of my things tomorrow
not until you pay me the rest of the money you owe
i paid you all your money
not the extra charges
she gets up in his face
fuck your stinking extra charges
as lacey and paul depart nick turns and dreamily wanders back toward his room
using bad language in front of a minor
the judge will hear about that too
nick gets back into his room and closes the door behind him
dwayne playing nintendo naked
he looks over his shoulder
whats all the ruckus about
please cover yourself
you wanna play nintendo all night
of course not
lets go to sleep
nick unplugs the nintendo and climbs into bed
dwayne just sits there on the floor naked as a clam
a strange night
i dreamed of wrestling for what seemed like hours with an amorous walrus
nick squirms with an amorphous blob they wrestle against the red abstract background
nicks bleary eyes snap open and wander to the floor where his pajamas lie in a crumpled pile
there is only one explanation i have been dwayned
a pillow whacks across a blubbery face
i know what you were doing last night you disgusting beast
dont be mad nick
i like you
dwayne throws off his sheets
nick shudders at the sight
which is when mrs
crampton barges in
boys time to get ahh
wheres yer pajamas
nick made me take them off mom
he took off his too
you leave my son alone
dont go corupt him with yer nastiness
we werent doing anything mrs
it was just hot last night
if you get hot boys open a window
dont go takin off yer pajamas
nick dials on the phone
behind him dwayne eats breakfast cheerfully kicking his feet back and forth under the chair
taggartys at her desk
her thick rimmed glasses almost make her look studious
i suppose you want to talk to sheeni
if you please
taggarty crosses to the bunks where sheeni is curled up among the sheets as if in some renaissance portrait
its your would be lover
sheeni sleepily takes the phone
hello my beloved
how are you
not so well
i have been afflicted with some kind of chronic fatigue
perhaps you are home sick
you do sound rather blue
im not home sick nick
in fact im not very happy with you
what did i do
you know damn well nick
youve been spreading rumors about trent
and he doesnt deserve it
doesnt deserve it
id have to claim he has genital warts to sink to his level
well whatever you said to ed solomon it was enough to get him to give trent a black eye
sheeni i just dont get it
this guy has cock blocked at every turn and youre taking his side
well have to resume this another time nick
its been an emotionally exhausting weekend
my parents are in an uproar over paul
hes moved some floozie in with him up in the studio over the garage
laceys not a floozie
you know her
shes my fathers ex girlfriend
i think that might make you my stepmother in law
dont be gross
at any rate ill let you go
well have plenty of time to settle this tomorrow
yes sheeni thanksgiving
ill be coming for dinner of course
dont even think it nick
you know my parents dont approve of you
im confident they will learn to love me
after all im practically family
nick you must dismiss this thanksgiving notion from your mind
i remain firm on this issue
nick regards the phone defensively
he puts it down and takes a seat at the table
he glares at dwayne as they eat breakfast
there comes a knock at the front door
dont move blubber boy ill get it
a police officer stands on the steps
nick goes wide eyed at the sight of him and visibly slumps
is george twisp in
uh im pretty sure hes sleeping off a hangover officer
is he under arrest
no im the officer working the case of his stolen car
you can tell your pop that the cd he found in his car is ravi shankar
so were a checkin the ins files see if we can get some prints that match
you wouldnt know anyone who might have stolen the car who listens to this crap would ya son
no and im not sure i like the implication
ravi shankar is beloved by many caucasian
what about vijay joshi
nick stands stiff as a board
the officer peers around him at dwayne sitting inside
im pretty sure hes injun
the officer makes a note
to himself vijay joshi
well look into it
thank you boys
nick gives a weak smile and closes the door
crampton complained to dad that i tried to corrupt the fat pervert cohabitating with me
nick totes boxes of belongings from the house to the cramptons dilapidated camper
he has deemed it strike three but is only banishing me as far as mrs
cramptons condemned trailer
a view of the thin birch walls
we come to rest on nick shivering under an electric blanket
theres a blob of snot on his upper lip
tomorrow i will be reunited with my everlasting love
and i will not be stopped
not by an outbreak of the plague nor by a cruel return of the ice age
not even by the gods themselves
the velvet voices of the rat pack come from the home
nick emerges from the camper wrapped in the electric blanket
he scurries into the house
nick straightens his garcia tie in the mirror
he applies hair gel
nick examines the whitehead on his brow
he pinches and a glob of puss smacks the mirror
he emerges into the hall and dances with an invisible partner into the
where the phone rings
he flips off the stereo with the remote and snatches up the phone
nickie i have some bad news
what is it
im afraid lance and wally got into a terrible row
he tried to arrest wally and wally broke lances jaw
whats the bad news
the berkeley police know you started the fire
lance told them where you are
nick glances up and sees the black and white patrol car pulling up outside
nick theyre coming to arrest you
he slams down the phone
the window slides open and nick comes crawling out leaping to the ground
he takes off running through the woods
nick pounds on the door
nick turns to find lefty coming up the path with two bags of groceries under his arms
lefty have you seen vijay today
nick havent you heard
vijays been arrested
for grand theft auto
they found his prints in your fathers car
did he go quietly
he said you were his accomplice and now the ukiah police are looking for you
we linger a beat on nicks blank expression
were off and running through the woods trying to keep up with nick as he flees
the day has proven to be a disaster
where did i gone wrong
i have a decision to make
the spotlight from the overhead helicopter sweeps over the bridge and continues down the road
i could hit the road and spend my life a fugitive with my integrity nearly intact
nick squats in the shadows
hes holding a bouquet of municipal flowers and dabs the sweat on his head with his tie
its that or risk incarceration to keep my dinner date
obviously the answer is clear
nick peers through the bushes at the mobile home across the street
a squad car crawls past the rover squawking a terse description of a teenage white male
nick emerges from the shrubs and approaches the house
he rings the ornate victorian doorbell
paul answers in an apron
right on time
lacey floats toward him and gives him a hug
happy thanksgiving lacey
she spots the sad flowers in his hand
what interesting flowers nick
who are they for
lacey leads him by the hand into the chintz bedecked parlor
sheenis larger than life father and year old mother sit cross legged on the floor running their hands over the hooked rug
saunders you remember nick twisp dont you
saunders coos and takes the flowers
her husband squints up at him
you are very very tall
no hes not dad
he just appears tall because you are on the floor
i can feel the floor pushing against me
can you feel it too tall youth
nick glances over at mrs
saunders who is now eating the flowers
paul served an appetizer earlier
yes its a recipe i picked up in the southwest
nick smiles with amusement
taggarty makes her entrance down the stairs cloaked in a green cape
how is the star crossed persistent lover
she greets him with a casually intimate kiss
okay i guess
she saw you coming and hid in her room
nick knocks and enters to find sheeni sprawled on the bed with a book
dinner is almost ready my love
i do not intend to be party to my brothers absurdities
he has allowed you in and drugged my parents
i think they are deriving some good from the experience
sheeni finally looks up from her book
what are you doing here nick
i expressly asked you not to come
to hell with that
what do i have to do to prove my love to you
my friends have gotten laid and im pretty sure neither one of them was beaten with a tree trunk raped by a walrus or had to contend with the likes
of trent preston
you were raped by a walrus
sheeni i have shown restraint i have committed crimes i have traveled to the lengths of the state and still you wont give me this one little thing
why dont you just say it
thats what you want
you want me to have sex with you
a beat as nicks open admissions makes her consider his point
she sighs and shakes her head
how is my dog
he should be coming out of the oven right about now
she tosses the book at him but he dodges it successfully
i hate you nickie
she stands up and tries to slap him
he grabs her wrists and pulls her to him
i hate you too
they share a long intense kiss
they break away and she smiles in spite of herself
the saunders and extended family take their seats at the polished mahogany table crammed with turkey yams mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce
they all lower their heads and lacey leads them in prayer
saunders emits a long low fog horn of a fart that ends badly
the others exchange glances but he and his wife still have their heads solemnly bowed
dear lord thank you for this bounty
help us to be tolerant of others especially the boyfriends and girlfriends of our immediate relations
they begin eating
a helicopter passes by outside search light briefly coming through the windows
nick watches mr
saunders take a handful of mashed potatoes and apply it to his face like war paint
your father looks rather strange
well mother he is sitting in his own bowel movement
thats no excuse
another helicopter passes overhead
the food is delicious paul
sister darling how long has it been since we all observed the rituals of thanksgiving
not long enough paul
i hope its the first of many such occasions for me
sheeni narrows her eyes at him
a long beat as they all dine in silence
saunders croaks out in song
siiiilent night hooooly night aaaall in calm aaall is bright
paul begins humming approvingly and one by one the others accompany her as mr
saunders pretends to conduct them with a drumstick
round yon virgin mother and child holy infant so tender and mild sleep in heavenly peace
sle eep in heavenly pee eace
and with that the doorbell rings
taggarty gets up and opens the door
oh trent you made it
nick glances up with a start as trent preston makes his entrance
hes not quite the deity nicks expected but rather a fairly plain blond with slightly androgenous features and a certain flamboyance
his black eye courtesy of ed solomon still remains
saunders grunts his acknowledgement as he takes the pitcher and pours water into his own lap
trent darling this is nick
trent swivels slowly around and they lock eyes
nick at last we meet
have a seat trent
im sorry taggarty i cant stay
i have bad news
what is it
bernice lynch has tried to commit suicide
sheeni and taggarty gasp
nick swallows hard
she swallowed a number of sleeping pills and is now in a coma
the poor girl
before i left school i searched her room
did you obtain proper authorization from the officials
no nick i acted on my own initiative
in bernices closet i found this letter
he dramatically extracts the letter from his pocket
in the letter the writer instructed bernice to begin sedating sheeni with drugs he himself supplied
nick you didnt
well you see
you could have killed me
no one yet mr
saunders points a liver spotted finger in his direction
i cant arrest him
but i have called the santa cruz police
they are on their way here now
nick places his napkin next to his plate and stands
well i shall be going now
please continue without me
nick i suggest you remain here and face the consequences like a man
nick stops in front of trent
thank you for that unsolicited counsel trent
and please do drop dead
the other guests murmur their shock
nick stops in the doorway
i did it all for you
you are completely contemptible nick twisp
i never wish to see you again
with the dreadful proclamation ringing in his ears nick leaves
nicks silhouette figure racing through the trees
here i am reviled by friends and family
relentlessly pursued by three police jurisdictions
nick stops at the edge of the woods to catch his breath
froncois suggests we flee the country
but where to go
he looks up the road which has been blocked off by flashing squad cars
the downtown high rises protrude from the layer of smog
in pre lap someone pushes a door buzzer repeatedly
joanie opens the door and finds nick on her doorstep
uh hi joanie
hows it going
since my sister can see through me im obliged to give a relatively candid and thorough review of the events
joanie listens gravely shaking her head at the most gruesome parts of the story
nick finishes flopping into a chair
nick six months ago you were just another brownnosing honor student
im not really sure
i fell in love with sheeni
all i want is to be with her
the rest is all a big misunderstanding
nick youve stolen vandalized trespassed and burned down berkeley
all for one girl
if theres a misunderstanding its with your insight into females
but where did i go wrong
nick boys your age are always looking for the path of least resistance to becoming a man
a boys whole self esteem rests on how fast he can get a girl into bed
so far i agree
sooner or later what those boys realize is that the girls youre chasing base their self esteem on how many hoops they can get the boy to jump through before
going to bed with him
nick furrows his brow
clearly that had not occurred to him
so i guess what you should ask yourself is how far are you willing to go
nick nods in understanding
an epiphanic smile
all the way joanie
im willing to go all the way
joanie nods in amusement
you can stay here a couple days but eventually theyll come looking for you
i dont have much money to give you but here
nick takes the wad of cash clearly moved
i love you
i love you too you little brat
nick slaps the cash on the counter and slides it under the window
one ticket to ukiah please
lance squats on the toilet in a neck brace
he chuckles over an issue of penthouse
the phone rings
he picks it up yeah
hey bacon boy its nick
nick ya little prick where are ya
nick is crammed into the phone booth
hes wearing shades and a fedora
youre on a need to know basis gorilla boy
lance seethes inwardly
no matter theyll get you eventually
let me make it easy
ill be at redwood high school tomorrow morning
round up your donut dipping friends
im turning myself in
nick slams down the phone before lance can respond
nick sits by the window the suitcase on the seat next to him
and the bus flies past the sign that says welcome to ukiah
nick steps off the bus and finds lefty loading his belongings underneath
lefty lifts his eyes and sees his friend
what are you doing here
everyone and their mothers mother is looking for you
they have me soon enough
where are you going
im done being dead nick
heather and i are going back to oakland for christmas
you should have heard how glad my parents were that i didnt kill myself
they were even happier when they found out im not gay
thats great lefty
yeah being in love is pretty great
so whats your plan nick
nick answers with only pensive silence
nick is about to knock on the door when paul opens it in another display of clairvoyance
welcome back nick
we had a feeling you were coming
nick sits beside paul and lacey on the couch as they watch the infamous chicken scene in rebel without a cause
paul and lacey are kind enough to share some leftover fungi to help calm my nerves
that combined with yet another viewing of james deans performance is what gives me my final burst of inspiration
they all watch transfixed as james dean leaps from his automobile just in time to escape demise
as the end credits of rebel play behind them lacey fits a bombshell wig on nicks head and finishes the last touches of make up that make him
who we will come to know as carlotta ulansky
nick regards his female alter ego in the mirror
francois of course wants no part of this and demands that we make a run for the border
but i have decided to veto him
its time to face the music
nick turns the key in the ignition and christmas music rises from the speakers
and the music plays over
where a crowd begins to form in anticipation of nicks arrival
nick watches from behind a tree on the ridge
where police cars and news crews are pulling up to interview the students
the parking lot is now filled with police cruisers and fbi vans the news crews redwood high students and an apparently california wide nick twisp cult following
tina manion speaks into a student news crew camera
this is tina manion reporting live at redwood high in ukiah where local law enforcement as well as the fbi awaits the promised arrival of nick twisp
there comes a murmur from the crowd and tina directs the student camera man to the road on the ridge where
georges bmw pulls to a stop overlooking the school
thats my car
the crowd hushes as the door opens and nick emerges
of the parking lot below which looks like the kind of turn out one would expect of a star wars prequel
staring up in silence
estelle wally vijay trent dwayne george lacey paul
nick gives a little wave as if he were a celebrity
the parking lot erupts with cheers of his name
a few berkeley kids hold up a sign that reads im single lets then shouts of warning from the megaphones
and as the flashers and sirens come to life nick jumps back into his fathers car and peels out
nick glances in the rear view mirror as the cops bear through the cloud kicked up in his wake
nick pops in a cd and turns up the christmas music to drown out the sirens
he zips across the covered bridge the train of law enforcement in hot pursuit
he yanks the wheel hard and veers off onto the mountain road
a few of the squad cars miss the turn and skid side long through a picket fence
nick takes the switchbacks at per wheels practically sliding off the turns
the bmw crests the hill and smashes through the chain link gate
as nick watches the quickly approaching cliffs edge he undoes his seat belt
he goes for the door handle eyes going wide when he finds power lock has engaged
the bmw hurtles off the bluff and soars through the air tires spinning a plume of snow blowing off the hood
the car descends into a nose dive and flips completely upside down hitting the ice covered surface of clear lake with a thundering smack
police cars swerve to a stop at the edge of the bluff and the crowd of officers and agents peer over the side at the hole in the ice
the bmw descends toward us in a storm of air bubbles
as it gently touches down at the bottom of the lake a somber trumpet solo comes in pre lap and we are
where a crowd of family friends and fans stand around in mourning garb over the funeral ceremony
my only comfort regarding my untimely death is knowing my friends and family will do just fine without me
we move from lacey and paul the latter of which is wailing away on the trumpet to lefty his head hung low
heather pulls his head to her breasts
as it would turn out heathers vaginal canal is slightly misshapen
lefty humping heather in the grass ala the scene in which we met him
and thus completely compatible with leftys otherwise incongruent penis
a little to the right
where we find vijay glancing over at taggarty as she smokes a cigarette
vijay would eventually manage to pin the car theft on me
but had lost the attention of taggarty forever
who by the way
never would find her perfect a
taggarty at her wall
ed solomon lounges in the bed behind her
and would therefore start grading on a curve
with a quick stroke of her pen she changes eds grade from a b minus to a b plus
where we find joanie sniffling
joanie of course would get to continue to travel the world
joanie serves up a beverage in first class
and she and her breasts would probably go on to have the wonderful life that they deserve
the celebrity she is serving looks from her cleavage to her eyes
she gives a little smile
where we find estelle weeping quietly against wallys shoulder
wally as it turns out
estelle watches from the audience as wally scribbles at his podium while alex trebeck hosts inaudibly
would go on jeopardy and win ensuring my mothers blessed rise to a higher economic status
the answer on wallys screen says who is albert camus
alex trebeck shakes his head leaving wally with only but enough to best his two competitors
where we find george puffing on a cigar mrs
crampton behind him his hand resting on dwaynes shoulder
my father no longer burdened with crippling child support payments would now be able to afford the model bmw he always wanted
dwayne sticks his head out the window and shouts with glee as his flab flaps in the wind
and would come to find the surrogate son he always wanted in dwayne the only organism alive that could possibly appreciate georges driving
as the car accelerates we see the vanity plate reads thunder leaving just one last piece of business
and finally we arrive on sheeni expressionless
and as we continue to pan we reach
carlotta standing in the background
the bombshell haircut and thick glasses can barely be made out through her veil
paul finishes his trumpet solo and there is a moment of silence to observe the open casket and the single lets mingle shirt and shorts that are being buried inside
sheeni makes her way toward the line of limos and hearses
she approaches the distant carlotta
are you a friend of nicks
carlotta looks up startled
she composes herself and shakes sheenis hand
a terribly old friend
im sorry for your loss
you shouldnt be carlotta
i am no doubt culpable for nicks actions
well love does compel us to desperate acts
people cannot always act rationally
nick carlotta contd the greater the love the stronger the passions the more reckless the crimes
sheeni lets go a slight wistful smile
nick had wonderful a way of making me feel worthy of the pursuit
my dear if theres one thing the demise of nick twisp has taught me its that self worth comes from within
sheeni gives a pensive nod
would you like to stay the night carlotta
we can reminisce of our departed
a kind offer but i really must
i dont think i could bear to be alone tonight
carlotta does her best not to look conflicted but it shows
carlotta hurriedly finishes tucking herself in while sheeni brushes in the bathroom
carlotta hastily switches out the light
sheeni emerges in a few small scraps of flimsy black lace
what an attractive negligee
do you like it
i bought it in santa rosa last fall
i had hoped to wear it for nick
oh darling im sure he would have found it most
sheeni crawls into bed
she cuddles close
i like lying here with you carlotta
i cant think of anyone id rather lie here with
carlotta furrows her brow
except maybe nick
if nick were here what do you suppose he would do to me
make love to you i would think
then why dont you
take off that silly wig and make love to me
sheeni tugs off the wig and tosses it across the room
of course nick
did you really expect to fool your soul mate with such a disguise
nick swoons grasping her gauze glazed nakedness
take me darling
and as they engage in a feverish kiss rousing hymns surge
the church chorus joyful song rings hallelujah
the two lovers are entwined before an abstract red into the nicks penis nightclub where champagne bottles pop with the ringing in of a new era and the leopards roar
and the stage erupts with fireworks
nick sleeps with a grin on his face
he rouses at the touch of sheenis lips on his cheek
my parents are at services
they wont be back for hours
shall we have breakfast my love
what a lovely notion darling
you go ahead downstairs and get things started
sheeni hauls herself out of bed and grabs the phone off the cradle
what are you doing
calling taggarty to report that you are not completely incompetent in the bedroom
do i get to stay and hear my grade
not a chance mr
such things are reserved for girl talk only
and for good reason
she smiles at him and he smiles back
very well sheeni
dont be long
nick prances into the living room in his underwear
he starts to head into the kitchen when he catches sight of the full length mirror out of the corner of his eye
he stops in front of the mirror and flexes his biceps
francois appears in the mirror behind nick thompson slung over his shoulder
well good morning francois
what do you think
what do i sink
i sink nows are chance to run for ze hills
nick lowers his arms and furrows his brow
what do you mean
nick we are young yes
is the world not our oyster
beaucoup des filles
do you not want to know what it is like to make love to another girl
i do but
weve come so far
what about sheeni
yes she will always be ze first conquest but all zis time you saught zis was ze end ze one and only when in fact it is only ze beginning
nick lifts his eyebrows with dawning epiphany
in the reflection we can see behind nick as albert leaps onto the love seat and barks at the sound of approaching sirens
nick runs to the window just in time to see half a dozen law enforcement vehicles pull up
sheeni the police are here
he ducks down from the window as a chopper buzzes overhead
maybe i can sneak out the back
i dont understand
how do they even know im alive
well i called them of course
nick spins to face her
shes standing in the doorway and theres not a hint of wrong doing in her face
well thanks a pantsful
but nickie it had to be done
i cant very well marry a wanted man honey
look at it this way in a few months youll be a free man and we can be together in paris
nick looks to francois in disbelief
but the frenchman just rolls his eyes
you might as well break it to her now nick
a long pensive beat as nick contemplates telling her he may never see her again
but behind sheenis air of control nick finally sees the vulnerability hes had in his hands all along
francois is right of course but on the other hand why be cruel
after all sheeni had managed to give me hope every step of the way
and if hope is what sheeni would now need to go on well then
as always you are right my love
francois smacks his forehead with hand
the frenchman in the mirror sticks the barrel of the thompson in his mouth and blows himself out of frame just as
the front door bursts open and the fbi agents surround nick
the agents lead nick to the caravan of law enforcement parked in the road
it may not appear so but the truth is
ive got the world on a string
sheeni emerges from the home albert barking in protest
nick strains against his cuffs to look over his shoulder at her
write often nickie
i will darling
and dont worry about albert
hell be waiting for you too
as francois would remind me im intelligent healthy virile not violently ugly
on the whole i am splendidly equipped for this great adventure we call the human existence
the fbi agents shove nick into the back of their black saturn
nick watches out the back window as the car pulls away
a view of sheeni waving in the road albert at her feet
besides what jury would convict a teenager who acted out of love
and even if i do get to spend the next few months of my youth getting dwayned by the inmates of the california juvenile correctional system i did get my
thirty two minutes of lovemaking with one of the most outstanding girls of this or any other epoch
nick turns to face the front while behind him the waving figure gets ever more distant
a pensive moment as he actually questions
but was it all worth it
nick revisits those thirty two minutes in his mind and it brings a smirk to his face
you bet your left nut it was
and as tom jones shes a lady kicks in we
