story by harry e
chandlee and douglas w
churchill general atmosphere typical of a busy newspaper office
copy boys running about shirtsleeved reporters and rewrite men pounding away on typewriters
little wire baskets containing cylinders of copy whizzing back and forth such as are used in some department stores etc
morkrum machines typewriters telephone bells and all other sounds relative to a newspaper office when shot has been fully established it takes in the battery of morkrum machines clattering away
the crescent shaped copy desk the desk of the sporting editor with a big cauliflower eared pugilist and his manager standing by the side of the sporting editor a hefty guy in his shirtsleeves smoking a big cigar and wearing a green eye shade the desk of the society editor a prissy old lady who takes down a worn copy of the blue book as the camera passes her and starts looking up some data and any other interesting or typical bits that can be thought out
at the far end of the room is the desk of conroy the city editor
everything shows evidence of feverish activity and great haste
on conroy the city editor at his desk speaking on the telephone
yeah thats all i ever get from you guys a lot of hard luck stories
you come back here and ill give you an assignment
it will be a last interview with the cashier
he hangs up looks around with a scowl
conroy give me a crack at that schuyler story will you
if you ever got your foot into a drawing room youd step on a sliding rug
stew is the only man thats got brains enough to handle this
a copy boy rushes by on an errand
say spud did you find stew
well did you look in the
first place i looked
not there eh
for cryin out loud where is that
go and dig him up
until it takes in a sort of make shift screen concealing a corner of the room
on the other side of the screen
stew smith is holding something in his hand
his hat tilted back on his head and he is regarding this plaything intently
gallagher is sitting close to him also gazing intently at the plaything
gallagher is a girl one of the sob sisters on the newspaper dressed in a trim but inexpensive little tailored suit
here it is
pray for me gallagher
pray for me
on the object in his hand one of those hand puzzles where you have to land jumping beans in the holes
stew your hands are shaking
youve been drinking again
come on come on
here they come gallagher
here they come
conroys shouts are heard in the background
conspiratorially the boss is getting hoarse
theres the third one
if i dont get the last one theres a certain sob sister i know thats going to get a kick right in the
whoops almost had that
conroy the city editor at his desk looking about with a scowl for stew
the copy boy races over to whisper something to conroy
on stew smith gallagher
i made it
the screen concealing the washbasin corner
a wrathy conroy his eyes centering suspiciously on something
with his eyes on the screen conroy reaches out and grasps a heavy telephone book on the corner of his desk
still looking off he heaves it forcefully
showing the screen
the telephone book crashes into it overturning it and revealing stew and gallagher on the other side
they both look up startled
the newsroom erupts in laughter
conroy glaring off fiercely
come over here
conroy at his desk
stew saunters into the scene
look i quit
youre always picking on me
it took me three hours to get those little gadgets in those holes and you screw it up in a minute
he gives the hand puzzle to conroy who is immediately captivated by the fascinating object in his hand
superior mmm not as easy as it looks is it
conroy puts it down with a disgusted look
no wonder youre batty
would it be imposing too much upon you if i asked you to do a little work today
just to sort of break the monotony
with me you can always do business
do you know what to do in a drawing room
it isnt a question of knowing what to do its knowing how to get in one that counts
the telephone rings conroy answers it
speaking on the phone yeah yeah
he hangs up turns back to stew
now listen weve got a tip that the schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame
yeah little gloria
the human cash register
got her hooks into the schuyler kid eh
right for the first time this year
modestly well its only april
come on get going get going
loftily get going where
i can write that yarn without stepping out of the office
yeah and get us into a million dollar libel suit
it wouldnt be the first time
now you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady the sister or the kid
any of them but get it
resigned all right
give me a voucher for expenses
all you need is carfare to long island
youd better get a shave and a shine because you youre going to have a tough time getting in there as it is
i know those bluenoses
their ancestors refused to come over on the mayflower because they didnt want to rub elbows with the tourists
so they swam over
he turns away and exits
someone pacing outside the mansion gates
a guard dog pacing inside the gates
a parrot on its perch hopping from foot to foot
michael schuyler a callow youth with the usual dissipated spoiled look
his fingers are nipping out little chunks of a folded piece of paper dropping the bits on the floor
this is indicative of a habit of the individual in question when undergoing nervous stress
he is very fidgety and apprehensive as he glances around
anne schuyler a beautiful and aristocratic though slightly hard girl a few years older than michael
stuyvesand van alstyne schuyler mother of anne and michael
a grande dame stern and glowering
her attitude indicates suppressed nervousness and anger
she glares over in the direction of michael
then she turns and looks in another direction
viciously dexter grayson if you were any kind of a lawyer youd get those letters back
dexter grayson the family lawyer standing his hands clasped behind his back just completing the pacing of a few short steps in his best courtroom manner his head bowed in
an attitude of deepest thought
he is dressed in striped afternoon trousers and black coat
he turns to regard mrs
but i keep telling you how difficult it is mrs
the last time i asked her for those letters she made very uncouth noises with her mouth
anne schuyler trying desperately to keep from laughing
to reveal a full shot of the room and group
they are in the magnificent drawing room of the schuyler home resembling the union depot and furnished with almost imperial splendor and magnificence
they very much resemble a jury in session
as they continue
i dont know why youre making all this fuss
i only sent her six of them
sarcastic if you had to make a fool of yourself why didnt you tell it to her instead of writing
because i couldnt get her on the phone
you should have known better than to write romeo
i found that out a long time ago
i should say you had
at the rate you two are going well have to leave the country to save our faces
lets hop over to monte carlo
its a great place to save a face
oh shut up
a butler appears in the doorway
he is about to say something but he stammers and turns
stopping him what is it smythe
pardon me madam but what am i to say to the newspapermen
schuyler looks distractedly at grayson
schuyler and grayson
she rises and speaks imperiously dexter go out and tell those ruffians i have nothing to say
grayson faces her placatingly
you cant do that
leave it to me
i know how to handle reporters
with a shudder all right then get it over with
grayson turns officiously toward the waiting butler
weve decided to see the reporters
send in the man from the tribune first
very good sir
oh smythe some bicarbonate of soda quick double strength
i know those news mongrels will upset me
ive anticipated it madame
the bicarbonate is ready
the butler exits
this room resembles the grand central station
it is lined with bookcases filled with gorgeous first editions and special bindings and is furnished in the extreme of magnificence and luxury
present are stew and bingy reporter from the tribune
stew is seated idly leafing through a first edition
bingy still with his hat on spots an expensive music box on a nearby table opens it and does a little jig to the tune that is emitted
bingy as he lingers at the table
he is a lazy sloppy looking guy
his face needs a shave and his pants need pressing
there is a spot of dried ketchup on his tie
on the table is a humidor
bingy opens it and lifts out a handful of cigars
as he looks up from the book he suggests hey bingy youll find the silverware in the dining room
bingy turns putting the cigars in his pocket
grayson has decided to see you
both stew and bingy start forward eagerly
smythe continues the gentleman from the tribune first
bingy beams broadly and stew is disappointed
there are no gentlemen on the tribune
i understand sir
smythe leads the way out
as bingy passes by stew trips him
say take it easy
take it easy
listen my boy
no use you hanging around here
just buy the tribune tonight and read all about it
you can rewrite it for your last edition
couldnt make the last edition
itd take me four hours to translate your story into english
oh is that so
bingy turns to leave
take off your hat
you might make an impression
bingy dutifully doffs his hat
put it on again
hey make up your mind will you
bingy hurriedly puts his hat back on as he disappears
by the door which leads out into the hall
the butler enters and stops standing stiffly
bingy enters behind him shambling awkwardly
he stops in some consternation as he sees the schuyler jury
schuyler anne and michael all surveying him in varying degrees of unfriendliness
bingy hesitates uneasily as he regards this impressive assemblage
quickly he takes his hat back off
then he smiles nervously and starts forward
grayson comes forward to meet him attempting to be very cordial
bingy is seized by a sudden impulse to sneeze
he does so violently
there is awkward silence
schuyler throws off a visible shudder
whats the matter
isnt there a bless you in the crowd
youre the tribune man
how are you
bingy extends his hand
grayson pointedly ignores it
have a seat
thanks i will
bingy crosses the room taking note of the beauteous anne
bingy sits gingerly on the edge of a handsome chair
bingy and grayson
grayson picks up a very flossy and expensive cigarette box from the small end table beside the chair
it is made of gold and semi precious stones are inset in the cover
grayson opens the lid and takes out a cigarette but pointedly does not offer one to bingy
grayson remains standing before the reporter who is very uncomfortable and ill at ease
fine newspaper the tribune
well i should say
i knew your managing editor very well
is that so
yale i believe
we were classmates
she clears her throat menacingly as she looks sternly at grayson
whats the matter
she got a cold
bingy and grayson
both look over
grayson gives her a quick reassuring glance as though to say leave it to me now
he continues his conversation with the reporter
i got him his job on the paper
im a stock holder you know
is that so
as one tribune man to another he laughs
but right now im acting in the capacity of mrs
oh thats all right with me
i wont hold it against you
but you see im here to find out about i know i know
but theres no truth in the story whatsoever
grayson and bingy
he takes bingy by the arm and leads him over to a corner of the room assuming a confidential pose
speaking as they walk however ive taken the trouble to prepare a little statement
here it is
grayson and bingy
grayson takes an envelope out of his pocket and hands it to bingy
bingy opens the flap and sees the contents
the corner of a fifty dollar bill protrudes
bingy quickly shuts the envelope up
grayson is watching him closely
so you see how silly that rumor is
its a lotta hooey
thats what i wanted to say but i couldnt think of it
grayson starts leading him toward the door
camera pans with them as grayson leads him toward the door talking as they walk
thank you very much
all right all right dont mention it
give my regards to your managing editor
i certainly will
they stop at the door
bingy extends a handshake which is again refused
he stops and looks back at the jury
the schuylers all sitting silently and contemplating him
well so long folks
he flutters his eyes at anne
he takes one last look at mrs
schuyler and is again gripped by a violent sneeze
rising to the occasion uh bless you
the butler appears in the doorway behind him
bingy exits past him beaming
waving to butler so long
grayson nods to the butler
smythe bring in the other reporter
the group awaiting the advent of the post reporter
stew is shown in by the butler still carrying the conrad book in his hand
they give him the once over
schuyler raises her lorgnette with a magnificent gesture
stew eyes them with animation not in the slightest discouraged by this supercilious scrutiny
he starts toward them
as stew approaches them
schuylers the name i presume
yes thank you thank you
my names smith stewart smith
no relation to john joe trade or mark
of course you cant have everything
he smiles engagingly on them
stew addresses mrs
schuyler ingratiatingly disregarding her expression of obvious distaste
nice set of conrads you have out there mrs
i was just glancing through this one
indicates the book in his hand whats michael tearing the paper about
just a habit
schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around
since when is a breach of promise case a rumor
no breach of promise case has been filed
the matter has been settled out of court
very cagey oh i see but gloria doesnt seem to be satisfied with the twenty thousand dollars
at this mrs
schuyler rises wrathfully
furiously to grayson dexter grayson you told me it was only ten thousandand you didnt even get those letters from that jezebel
oh so you did give her ten thousand dollars eh
and there are letters
behind stews back grayson makes violent gestures for her to shut up
that takes it out of the rumor class doesnt it
we admit nothing
however i have a little statement all prepared
he takes stews arm and walks him off toward a corner much in the same manner as he handled bingy and lowers his voice confidentially
apart from the others
i have it here
grayson takes an envelope out of his pocket and hands it to stew
stew puts the book under his arm takes the envelope and extracts the contents
it is another greenback
with interest fifty bucks eh
he regards it a moment then replaces the bill in the envelope
his voice is matter of fact and almost casual
dont you know you should never offer a newspaper man more than two dollars
if you do hell think its counterfeit
i dont need fifty dollars
as a matter of fact ive got fifty dollars
grayson is considerably disconcerted
he tries again
the man from the tribune seemed perfectly satisfied
yeah bingy would
he never saw fifty dollars before
you could have bought him for six bits
funny thing about bingy
the more he gets the more he prints
he looks stupid doesnt he
but oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter
he hands the envelope back to grayson and turns away
schuyler group taking his action with dismay
stew starts walking back toward them talking as he walks grayson beside him considerably distracted
so ten grand was the amount you gave the girl
any other statement you folks would like to make
there is an explosive chorus from the group
ad lib talking at the same time thats not so
we have nothing more to say
well make no statements
he turns to them holding up his hand and speaking plaintively
wait a minute
dont get excited
i wouldnt worry about it
a little publicity never hurt anybody
she is on the point of an apopletic stroke
she advances menacingly toward stew
she calls to grayson
shrieking at him dexter have this person leave immediately
stew is not at all perturbed
dexter takes him by the arm and starts to lead him out
i think youd better go
wait a minute thats a great story
newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from schuyler mansion and anne comes up to him
wait a minute he faces her and cannot help but register an appreciation of her beauty
dont mind mother
cheerfully i dont mind her if you dont
schuyler almost choking in her wrath at this outrageous stranger
anne stifles a smile at this cheerful insolence
im sure youre quite willing to be decent about this
why miss schuyler i want to be noble
anne continues in her most devastating manner
youre not going to print this silly thing are you
she puts her hand lightly on his arm
because my names schuyler too
and i havent done a thing but ill suffer with michael
and so will mother
he has been listening to this and enjoying it immensely
he looks over at mrs
who is making a show of holding back a flood of tears
mothers suffering already
anne not wanting to lose her point looks up at stew pleadingly
as a special favor to me you wont print that story will you
stew looking down at her in frank approval and admiration
pleading please stew hesitates still
schuyler michael and grayson
all watching the couple intently hanging on the next wordswondering if anne is going to succeed
they are tense and expectant
he is looking down into her soft melting eyes
then he smiles
you know something lady if you sold life insurance id go for a policy in sixty seconds
oh thank you i knew youd understand
they relax and exchange relieved and triumphant glances
apparently anne has won
stew turns aside
may i use your telephone
right over there
youre all right
stew starts for the telephone
anne walks to her mothers side
stew gets to the telephone and picks up the receiver
he turns to wink at the group thats an unlucky number
you know that dont you
at the telephone
he turns back to the instrument as he gets his connection
into phone hello toots
is conroy there
give me conroy
pause he isnt
try the washroom will you
while he waits for the connection he turns and addresses the group expansively
say i interviewed a swell guy the other day einstein
swell guy a little eccentric but swell
doesnt wear any garters
neither do i as a matter of fact
what good are garters anyway
he turns back to the phone hello conroy
this is smith talking
im up at the schuylers
no im not having tea that is not yet
again he winks expansively at the groupthen returns to conroy is she beautiful
oh boss her pictures dont do her justice
if i was that guy ziegfield what
anne smiles in spite of herself at this flattery
stews voice goes on
yes its easy to see where her beauty comes from
from her mother
for the first time mrs
schuyler unbends to the extent of giving forth a smile
she cannot help but be pleased at this compliment
the atmosphere is now very friendly
everybody feels that everything is all right
stew at the phone now wait a minute
just hold on
keep your shirt on
im coming to that
the schuylers admit the story is true
they gave the gal ten thousand bucks
but shes got some letters and shes holding out for more dough and it looks to me like shes going to get it
horrified and shocked at this betrayal and double crossing
on the phonebreezily right boss
ill be right over
right no i dont think i can get any pictures now
he casually hangs up and turns from the phone
involuntary gasp oh h h
anne confronts him as if he were a reptile of the lowest order
voice cold as ice ive met some rotters in my time but without a doubt youre the lowest excuse for a man ive ever had the misfortune to meet stew
starts walking toward the door still holding his book
the family is tremendously indignant and agitated
stew stops turns looks at them
he is met by icy glares
he indignantly takes a nickel out of his pocket and hands it to grayson
with dignity well if you feel that way about it heres a nickel for the phone call
he glares at themturns and walks out
they watch him walk out stunned and open mouthed
insert dingy board sign outside a building
insert three column heading in newspaper gloria golden follies beauty retains love letters
a reasonably respectable speakeasy smoke filled
quite a number of men and a few women are leaning on the bar and seated around at the tables
stew and gallagher are seated at one of the rude round tables smoking drinks before them
gallagher is reading the newspaper story
she is grinning at the story
and she walked up to me and put her hand on my shoulder and said mimicking anne mr
smith you wouldnt print that story would you
oh no i wouldnt print it read it
over stews shoulder
she laughs at his attempted imitation
youre sure going to be poison to that junior leaguer from now on
i hope not
ive got to call on her this morning
gallagher looks up in astonishment
sure i must drop in on the mad wench
her wounds need soothing
for heavens sake stew are you completely bats
i thought the story was cold
you cant go back there
sure the story is cold but im not
im sizzling look
he moistens a finger touches it to his wrist and makes a sizzle noise
gallagher looks over quizzicallya little suspiciousa little jealous
a drawn out knowing utterance o o oh
came the dawn came the dawn
over gallaghers shoulder
and with it came love
oh gallagher youve got to meet her
shes it and that enthusing and those and them
gallagher takes a sip of her drink before answering
well ive seen her pictures and i dont think shes so hot
disparaging gesture oh you dont appreciate it
her pictures dont do her justice
why gallagher shes queenly she is queenly and i know queens
continues in exaltation and oh has she got herself a nose and i know noses too
that little snozzle of hers is the berries i tell you
and is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens
of course i havent got a nose
stew gives her a hurt look
shaking his head sure sure
youve got a nose gallagher
youve got a nose
but theres different women gallagher
you know like brewery horses and thoroughbreds
deliberately misunderstanding on now stew dont be too hard on her
i wouldnt call her a brewery horse
shes the real mccoy
and the rest of us are truck horses
reproachfully there you go talking like a woman
a trifle resentfully well
well youre my pal arent you
then dont turn female on me
during these last few speeches gallagher has been regarding him with a curious expression
she loves being his pal but wishes he would realize she is also a woman
stew seems a little resentful of her attitude
pay that check will you gallagher
ill give it back to you some time
he flourishes the book of conrad which has been lying on the table in front of him and makes a grand gesture
i go now i go with conrad in quest of my youth
fry those tomatoes will you gallagher
he strikes a poseand exits
gallagher sits looking after him considerably disturbed
sitting looking dismally after stew
she opens her bag and takes out a mirror surveying herself with frank disapproval
she pulls out a curl of hair before each ear tries to soften the severe brim of the hat
she puts a finger to the tip of her nose and tilts it up studying the effect
then with a sigh of disgust she throws mirror and bag onto the table
smythe the butler previously introduced comes from the direction of the rear of the house and proceeds down the long vast hallway towards the front door
the bell keeps ringing steadily
the butler reaches the wide front door
as the butler opens the door and reveals stew standing outside hatless a book in his hand a spring overcoat slightly askew the pockets bulging with contents
the butler quickly tries to slam the door in stews face but stews right foot comes forward with a practiced newspapermans gesture and he forces his way into the room
reproachfully now now jeeves
was that nice
was that being a gentleman jeeves
was it jeeves
your name is jeeves isnt it
stiffly the name is smythe
well well well
with a y huh
wags his head congratulations
what a small world
brothers under livery
he grabs the butlers hand now as a smith to a smythe glacially mrs
schuyler is not at home
i know i know
i waited outside till she went out
shes a very nice lady but we dont vibrate well together
anne dressed in smart sports clothes starts to cross thru the hall
she stops as she sees the butler engaged in conversation with stew
hollowly no ones at home sir
anne starts walking toward them
stew spots her
now jeeves what would you call this no one
anne comes up to them
anne looks up and sees that the butler is frowning and uncomfortable and addresses him
schuyler left orders miss that if this person came here again i was to call the police
thats a good idea telephone the police
the number is spring
get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge
you may go smythe
but i now the lady said you may go the butler bows stiffly and exits
to stewdirectly what do you want
well i tell you yesterday when i was here i had one of your books in my hand and when i got outside i realized i still had your book
in my hand
so as long as i had your book in my hand i thought i might as well take it home and read it
this morning i got up and put your book in my hand and heres your book in your hand
he extends the conrad book and anne making no effort to take it he throws it on the table
haughty thats considerate of you
yeah that was considerate of me
i recommend you read it
stiffly im not interested in your literary recommendations
well maybe its a bit heavy for you
perhaps if youd like something lighter something with a touch of romance he takes a package of letters out of his overcoat pocket held together by a rubber band
he extracts one of them and opens it
just listen to this reading adorable babykins does her miss her baby
him sends his booful lil sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses
bobo is so lonely
interrupting coldly just a moment
i dont see how that trash could possibly concern me
stew advances a little closer putting up a finger
but you dont know who bobo is
and you dont know who babykins is
im not interested
smythe will open the door
she begins to walk away
brightly but bobo is your brother michael
and of course nobody would ever guess who babykins is
anne turns and stares at him incredulously for a moment
where did you get those letters
i stole them when i was interviewing babykins about bobo
anne looks up coldly
i suppose youre going to print them
no give you another guess
anne surveys him with frank scorn and dislike
scornfully oh i dont need another guess
its quite obvious
so its obvious huh
she turns toward the library
will you step into the library
with alacrity sure ill take a chance
anne walks majestically with head held highthru the hallthru the living room and to the library
camera trucking ahead of them
this is a very long walk with anne walking ahead stew trailing
while walking with anne single file you know the indians used to walk like this
pause except the squaw always walked in the back
pause you know why that was
that was in case of attack from the front
pause of course if the attack was from the rear she had to depend upon her papoose
pause oh yes the papooses always had bows and arrows
pause of course if she wasnt marriedthen shed have to protect her own er er indicates rear with thumb over shoulder still walking what country is this library in
pause miss schuyler how about carfare back to the front door huh
anne sweeps in followed by stew
she walks directly to a desk opens a drawer and takes out a large check book
she draws up a chair and seats herself
anne at the desk starting to fill in the date on a blank check
what are your initials mr
er who has remained standing
he is watching her with a peculiar expression
my friends call me stew
its an injustice too because i hold my liquor all right
anne writes on the check
then she looks up
will uh five thousand be enough
for the letters of course
as stew walks closer and addreses her
gee you shouldnt do that miss schuyler
thats all right for your lawyer friend but you shouldnt go around thinking you can buy people
hands her the letters theyre yours
anne has been listening to him with a puzzled expression impressed by his obvious sincerity
i dont know how to thank you
motherll be so grateful shell probably want to kiss you
your mother will want to kiss me
give me back my letters
grabs the letters thats the breaks i get
its the mothers that are always grateful to me
with a smile he hands the letters back here
youre a peculiar person
why the other day i pleaded with you not to send in that story and gestures with letters patiently again i know but that was news
this is blackmail and i dont like blackmail
anne is regarding him with searching scrutiny
her icy belligerent attitude has vanished
i wont even pretend it isnt a very great favor
i wish there was something i could do for you well you could make this table a little uh a little less wide
he leans over closer to her there is something you can do for me miss schuyler
the smile goes out of annes eyesthe suspicion returnsshe is saying to herself i was right the first time
engagingly i havent had any lunch yet
have you got anything in the icebox
the hard disdainful look leaves annes face as she stares at this incredible guy with his incredible request
with a twinkle in her eyes she responds oh you fool
a lovely sunny room cretonne drapes and colorful painted furniture
stew and anne are sitting at the table
anne looks amused and
stew has the manner of having lived in this house all his life
he draws the cup of tea to him and puts in a lump or two of sugar
between him and anne on the corner of the table is a modernistic squatty little tea pot
after years of research i finally discovered that i was the only guy in the world who hadnt written a play so believe it or not in my spare time
im now writing a play
anne is casually amused
yeah i havent figured out the plot yet but its laid in a siberian village
youre a bit eccentric arent you
no most ordinary guy in the world me
only one thing wrong with me you dont wear garters
stew helps himself to another lump of sugar
naw thats just a symbol of my independence
he leans closer looking directly into her face
im color blind
thats whats wrong im color blind
ive been sitting here for a half hour looking at you and i dont know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet
anne smiles at this unexpected statement and stares at him very critically
im just beginning to believe that something could be done with you
say you could do anything with me you wanted to
putty just putty thats me
leaning closer now getting back to those eyes of yours would you mind if i kind of got closer so i could see them
not if youre going to lose any sleep about it
he gets closer takes her chin in his hand and gets an eyeful
now how would you like themopen like this
she smiles radiantly
close them both
getting warm something tells me id better leave
during the last speech mrs
schuyler enters and stops in the doorway surveying this astonishing scene with stupefied indignation and rage
anne gets quickly to her feet as mrs
schuyler sails forward
thats an excellent idea
oh hello mother
easily hello hello mrs
come right in
will you have a slug of tea
he hospitably indicates the table
schuyler is speechless with fury
she does not immediately reply
then what is this person doing here
why stew goes on
as a matter of fact i was just trying to decide the color of annes eyes
i cant tell whether theyre blue or whether theyre violet
what would you say mrs
bursting why quickly dont say it mother please
smith came here today to do us a great favor
schuyler and stew
schuyler with an effort restraining her impulse to yank stew out by the collar speaks
bursting with wrath indeed
perhaps he will do me a great favor
elaborate bow with pleasure madame
get out of here
distressed oh mother
with dignity its all right
its all right anne
i can take a hint
a bit subtle but i get it
its all right
ill explain to mother
he steps close to mrs
the caviar was lovely madam
stew starts to the door smiles at anne and remarks to mrs
schuyler as he passes her you must come over and see us sometime
schuyler freezes in inarticulate anger as stew gives a courtly bow and exits
anne in a stunning evening dress is seated a cocktail in one hand cigarette in the other
dexter grayson in evening clothes is standing before her
where were you yesterday
she has a faraway speculative look in her eyes
oh stew and i went for a long ride
dreamily dexter is there any finishing school we can send him to
witheringly yes sing sing
she ignores this crack
just the same hes going to be a different person when i get through with him
he is looking at her deeply disturbed
when you get through with him
yes itll be a very interesting experiment
sneering to make a gentleman out of a tramp
now anne you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player
you dont seem to understand that this ones different
he has brains
grayson seats himself beside her on the divan
fervently but what about me anne
she looks at him coldly with almost an expression of dislike
oh dont go serious on me dexter
an elaborate modernistic roof apartment thronged with people all in evening dress
stew and anne are walking down among them
anne is radiant and stew is happily guiding her among the stuffed shirts
anne stops before a group
there is the sound of conversation laughter clink of glasses music from stringed invisible orchestra etc
miss montgomery mrs
radcliff how di do
ad lib acknowledgements standing helping himself to a cocktail which a footman is passing about
dexter looks off with a frown of disapproval
they are looking off in annes direction
say whos annes new boyfriend
well if these old ears dont deceive me i believe his name is smith
cant be one of the brothers he hasnt a beard on
well he must have something if anne has got her clutches on him
there is the sound of a piano chord being struck
baxter the hostess is standing importantly by the grand piano at which is seated an anaemic looking young man
beside her stands a stout swarthy italian with bristling mustachios
baxter bows toward the swarthy one who bends almost double in acknowledgement
there is a polite scattering of applause and some of the guests seat themselves
martini starts to sing
unnoticed by the rest stew and anne slip out of the door into the roof garden
a most beautiful romantic spot
rose trees in blossom a vine covered pergola a splashing fountain a few choice marble statues low deep chairs placed to make a gorgeous spot
stew and anne enter from the direction of the house
the garden is dark except for the lights from the interior of the house
from within comes the voice of the singer rendering an extremely romantic sentimental italian love song
this will continue to the fade out of the scene
stew and anne walk still hand in hand toward the edge of the pergola where the shadows are deeper and where a couple of glorified steamer chairs are placed
there is a full moon overhead
she leads him toward a waterfall effect a glass partition down which water trickles
they go behind the dimly lit fountain and sit
in a low deep divan
we see them in silhouette as they go into a passionate embrace
all we hear is the faint voice of martiniand the uninterrupted splashing of the fountain
on divan arms around each other
anne pinch me will you
throw me out of here
give me the air
throw me out of this joint will you
anne smiles happily and pinches his nose
why should i
were happy arent we darling
throw me out because im beginning to get goofy ideas and they concern you anne
passionately none of your ideas can be goofy stew if they concern me
struggling my name is smith well that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month
im white male and over twenty one
ive never been in jail that is not often
and i prefer scotch to bourbon
i hate carrots i hate peas i like black coffee and i hate garters
i make seventy five bucks a week and ive got eight hundred and forty seven bucks in the bank and i dont know yet whether your eyes are blue or
although he is very close to her thats because youre too far away stew
throughout his speech anne never takes her eyes off him
as he fumbles now he turns
their eyes meet
his overwhelming desire for anne overcomes him
he dismisses as futile his effort to be practical sweeps her into his arms and kisses her passionately
typical atmosphere as before
featuring stew at his desk which is directly in front of the battery of morkrums whose clatter comes into the sound track
stew finishes up a phone call
he sits at his desk staring pensively at his typewriter
he is smoking a pipe and is in his shirt sleeves
his hair is rumpled and strewn over the desk is a bunch of crumpled up pieces of paper indicating that he has made numerous unsuccessful starts at writing something
a fresh blank sheet of paper is now in the typewriter
nearby at another desk asleep in a swivel chair with his feet elevated to the desk the low snoring of another reporter blends with the sounds of the morkrums and
other noises of the city room
at the reporters elbow is a telephone
desk of conroy the city editor
a small upright plate on his desk indicates his position
this is near the copy desk
characteristic activities are background for any action that may take place
reporters come up to throw their stories on conroys desk the phone rings etc
a boy comes in with a large number of newspapers under his arm which he throws on conroys desk
there are several copies of each of the rival newspapers in town
conroy spreads them out and begins to examine them
it is evident that he is nervous and jumpy about something
finally he starts to pound the typewriter
insert sheet of paper in typewriter on which is being typed
as she talks on the phone to one of her girlfriends sotto voce sure i got a new dress
a new hat too
listens well ill try to get stew to come with me
she glances in his direction yeah hes all right
you know he thinks hes stuck on some society gal
listens naw it wont last
it better not last
hastily glancing over the headlines of the papers
the phone rings
without looking at it conroy answers what
oh ill be surprised eh
listen if theres any news in that sheet that i havent thrown in the wastepaper basket ill eat it
he is looking down at the papers and suddenly his eyes focus on something which causes the cigar to drop from his mouth and an expression of mingled amazement and
rage comes into his face
we do not see at this point what it is he has read but we know it must be something sensational
abruptly he hangs up the phone
stew as he studies his typewriter
over his closeup comes the excited outraged voice of conroy
a look of infinite weariness and disgust comes over stews face and he grits his teeth
his general expression registers good god there he goes again
with one finger he pounds out four letters insert sheet in typewriter next to stew has typed he yanks the sheet out of the typewriter
he looks over and bellows furiously
you double crossing hound
come over here
stew gets up from his machine crumples the sheet of paper into a wad and flings it at the sleeping reporter
the wad strikes him in the face he wakes abruptly and automatically reaches for the phone
he picks up the receiver and in a voice fogged with sleep calls a number
at conroys desk
conroys expression is one of bitter reproach as he leans back in his swivel chair as stew approaches and stands by the desk
now listen boss if youre going to kick about that expense account interrupting fiercely do you call yourself a reporter
of other reporters the older man at the copy desk and perhaps a sob sister or two nearby who look up with expectant interest expecting to hear stew get a
at her desk
she looks up worried and apprehensive
stew and conroy
it has been alleged yes you wouldnt know news if you fell into a mess of it nose first
so youre the bright lad thats never been scooped
defensively not on my own beat no
howling so that he can be heard all over the room no
well where were you when that happened
he slaps the copy of the tribune furiously and shoves it into stews face
not knowing what it is all about stew with an injured expression takes the paper and looks at it
insert front page of tribune with subheads giving more explicit information the other reporters copy readers sob sisters etc
seeing the unusual commotion and stews bewildered reaction get out of their chairs and cross over to the city desk where they take up other copies of the same paper
to look at
there are amazed and excited exclamations
stew still staring dumbly at the paper
a few others are crowding around glancing over his shoulder etc
ive heard of people being scooped on their own funerals but this
why its news when anne schuyler gets her fingernails manicured but this
she gets married to one of our own reporters and the tribune beat us to it
he notices other reporters milling around well
what do you guys want
go on get back to your desks
go back to your work
returning his attention to stew now dont tell me you were drunk at the time and dont remember
or is this one of bingys snow storms
no no its true all right only we didnt want to get it in print yet thats all
well you see ive acquired one of those new mother in laws and we were afraid she wouldnt understand the whole idea
so we were going to wait till she went to europe
what do i care about your mother in law
youre still working for this paper arent you
or are you
well its your business to get news
and here you had a story right in your own lap and you let the tribune scoop us on it
making a first class grade a monkey out of me
if it ever happens again just dont bother about coming back
he dismisses stew with a wave of his hand
thanks for your congratulations
stew turns away from conroys desk and a group of his confreres come up surrounding him in a series of ad lib congratulations
some slightly profane pounding him on the back whooping and in general manifesting great surprise and glee
this group is increased by copy readers office boys and everybody jabbering and shouting at him
ad lib congratulations stew manages to break thru them and exits from scene
gallagherto intercut with above scene
she gets up and goes over camera panning with her and picks up another copy of the paper and reads the headlines
her face stricken and sick as she reads about stews marriage
abruptly she turns away out of scene
at gallaghers empty desk
stew comes in trying to stave off the mob
he turns on the congratulators pushing them off
whats the matter with you mugs
cant a guy get married without all this
looks around wheres gallagher
anybody seen gallagher
he forcibly breaks away from them and walks back toward the door the last of the wisecracks and goodnatured jeers being flung after him
gallagher is seated alone at a table looking very forlorn
her life is suddenly empty
a drink is in front of her untouched
she is fighting hard to keep her emotions under control
stew enters the speakeasy and mingles with patrons who offer congratulations
he comes to a stop by the table
she looks up forcing a smile
well well well
gallagher old pal
there you are
what did you run away for
i didnt run away
stew draws out the other chair at the table and sits down
he looks across at her grinning boyishly utterly unaware that what he has done has hurt her deeply
sure you ran away
arent you going to congratulate a guy
with sincerity sure
i wish you all the luck in the world pal
she puts her hand tenderly on his
i hope youll be very happy
stew expands under the comradeship of gallagher
he wants to talk
oh sure well be happy
whats the matter with your eyes
its the smoke
calling to bartender joe
a little snifter
returning his attention to gallagher say wasnt i a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that huh
he notices the newspaper which gallagher has been reading look at that
i dont know how i rate that gallagher
gosh theres a swell girl
i want you to meet her
she wouldnt want to meet me
im just an old load of hay
as his drink is served
thank you joe
returning his attention to gallagher tell you what well have one of those parties down at your house one of those spaghetti parties you know
gee we havent had one of those in a long time have we gallagher
quietly not since you broke into society
waxing reminiscent remember the time we had a spaghetti party and while i was serving the spaghetti i dropped it on the floor and while those mugs werent looking i
picked it up and served it to them anyway
yes anne would love that
looking across at him
do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates
sure anne would love that
remember shes a schuyler
now get this gallagher smith
thats the name
murmurs my error
well if she doesnt want to come ill come down alone
shaking her head oh no you wont mr
youre a married man now
mother always warned me never to run around with married men
resentfully say what kind of a pal are you
youre not going to leave me flat
gallagher tries to be elaborately casual
oh ill call you up some time
and if your social duties permit why cut that out
just because im married theres no reason for that
gallagher looks up and off seeing something that startles her
conroy the city editor entering the speakeasy
stew and gallagher
interrupting in a whisper hey ixnay heres the ossbay
stew looks around also startled
stew buries his head in the newspaper in pretense of looking for something
conroy appears at the table and stops
he indicates stew
whats the benedict looking for in the newspaper his lost freedom
stew slowly sticks his head up over the top of the table looking up
grinning sheepishly well if it isnt old fagin himself
conroy sits down at the table
gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story disgustedly baloney
calls off joe
bring me a special
gallagher tries to be very bright and smiling
to conroy isnt it swell about stews marriage
looking straight at her is it
gallagher self conscious realizes this tough old buzzard is on to her
she looks back at him for a moment then drops her head
stew is oblivious to this by play
conroy turns to stew
well when are you quitting
im not thinking about quitting
joe comes in with a drink for conroy
i take it you dont have to work for a living any more he takes a sip of his drink and looks over meaningfully
in a flash of anger now get this conroy
my name is smith
always was smith and always gonna be smith
is that so
he shows that he is genuinely interested in stew and his problems but cant help being a little sarcastic
anne schuylers in the blue book youre not even in the phone book
think that one over sucker
camera pans to closeup of gallagher
quickly in stews defense that doesnt make any difference quietly if they love each other
camera pans back to closeup of conroy
its like a giraffe marrying a monkey
looking off at stew listen youll never be anything but just the reporter that married the schuylers millions
stew smith is dead and buried
from now on youll be just anne schuylers husband
if you can smoke that without getting sick youre welcome to it
camera pans to closeup of stew but thats perfectly ridiculous
defensively wait a minute
now gallagher let me do the talking
get this conroy anne schuyler has got a lot of dough all right and i married her all right but her dough and me
gallagher is looking fixedly at stew very much worried about conroys dismal prophecies
conroy shakes his head in sorrowful gloom
as if he had not heard stew just a boid in a gilded cage a what
you heard me
a bird in a gilded cage
aw youve been reading a lot of cheap tabloids
anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat were gonna forget all about this social stuff and were gonna be known as mr
how do you like that
sarcasm and live on your salary i suppose
yeah live on my salary that is until i finish writing my play
snorts what play
the one about the siberian bloodhound
thats been all rewritten
its laid in araby now
araby my eye
conroy having finished his drink pushes back his chair and rises
he puts an affectionate hand on stews shoulder
well im sorry to see a good reporter go blooey starts away let me know when youre quitting
im not quitting
singing for hes only a bird in a gilded cage a beautiful sight to see he waves his hand tweet tweet ha ha he laughs loud and raucously and exits
stew glares after conroy
under his breath laugh laugh you hyena
gallagher realizes that conroy has hit home with the truth and is sorry for stew
she puts her hand over his sympathetically
dont pay attention to him stew
he doesnt know what hes talking about
im not paying any attention to him
you think that guy could get me upset
not that mug
hes a tough mug hard cynical
he doesnt know the fine things in life that guy
he swirls his drink thinking a bird in a gilded cage huh
its getting so a guy cant step out without being called a magnolia
stew smith a magnolia
say im not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life
ill tell you that
not me not me
im going to step out and mean something in this world
you watch me
he swirls his drink clearly bothered lost in his own thoughts say am i a lucky guy to be near anne schuyler
ive been hit with a carload of horseshoes and believe me i know it
lucky ill say im lucky
pause dont you think im lucky gallagher
sure i think so stew
i knew you would pal
clearly bothered a bird in a gilded cage eh
how is her family going to feel about it
oh theyll be all right
ill bring them around
swirling his drink gilded cage
besides im not marrying her family
stew smith in a gilded cage
clearly bothered that mug
what does he know
another jury scene
this time it is anne whos on the carpet
grayson in correct afternoon attire his hands behind his back and his head sunk is pacing back and forth in a very depressed and gloomy fashion
anne is seated her demeanor betokening sullen defiance
michael is pacing nervously smoking a cigarette
i dont know what you need me here for it isnt my funeral
schuyler stands by a table staring at a spreadout newspaper which is laid out on the table
she flings the newspaper aside
you stay right here michael
some day youll be head of this family but thank heaven i shant be here when it happens
and i hope you never have a daughter who gives you gastritis as anne has me
she pulls the bell rope for the butler
now mother calm yourself
theres no use in getting so excited
schuyler is vastly agitated
oh isnt there
as anne starts to get up sit down
looking off smythe
the butler appears in the doorway
in a weak agonized voice some bicarbonate quick
the butler bows and exits
she passes a nervous hand over her eyes
anne comes up to her
mother if you keep this up youll have a nervous breakdown before you go to europe
anne grayson and mrs
its a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family
i cant imagine what made you do such a thing
of all things a reporter
a barbarian who lets his socks come down
mother i promise you that he wont be a reporter much longer
once i get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named gallagher as anne starts to get up again sit down
the butler enters with a tray on which is a glass of bicarbonate of soda and brings it to mrs
walking immediately behind the butler is stew airily debonair
the butler glances somewhat uneasily at mrs
schuyler as he presents the tray
she glares blackly at stew without a word of greeting and taking the foaming glass from the tray starts to lift it to her lips
airily drink hearty mother
once more anne starts to rise out of her seat
schuyler pauses glowering at stew
stew nods perfunctorily to each member of the jury the total innocent
to michael and you
grayson does not acknowledge the greeting
schuyler having drained the glass dismisses the butler with a wave of the hand and directs her attention again to the matter at hand
in command well whats to be done
hes here now
they are all silent reluctant to speak in front of stew
stew looks at them all a little puzzled then he walks over toward mrs
schuyler and stew
nobody seems to want to do anything to mrs
schuyler brightly why not ask me
perhaps i can offer a suggestion
do what about what
witheringly about what
your marriage to anne
with a tone of dismissal oh my marriage to anne
schuyler we dont want you to go to any trouble about that
we just want the usual blessings thats all
schuylers eyes flash
she draws herself up with haughty dignity
young man i want you to know that i object violently to this whole affair
this finally brings anne out of her seat
she rises and crosses to stew making a show of embracing him
now mother your attitude is perfectly ridiculous
its done now
stewart and i are married
schuyler im afraid shes right mrs
im really very sorry mrs
schuyler that you feel this way
i was in hopes that you would like me
im not the burglar that you think i am
after all were married
i think the thing to do is to kiss and make up mother
furiously stop calling me mother
easily all right grandma glaring this mans impossible
i cant talk to him
grayson lets go where we can talk hic
she emits a burp then fixes a glacial look at anne see what youve done to me
without another word she turns and flounces angrily out of the room
grayson follows her
at the doorway he pauses starts to say something
they all look at him expectantly but no words come out
got it too huh
grayson gives a harrumph and exits
anne michael and stew
michael grins at stew
who won that round
michael starts moving toward the door
ruefully im afraid your mother won that round that is she got in the last blow
i dont feel the way they do
youre really not as bad as everybody thinks
effusively shaking his hand youre beginning to appreciate me eh
dont worry too much about mother shes enjoying this
come on upstairs ill give you a little he indicates a snifter grins and exits
anne crosses to stew and puts her arm around his shoulder
to michael a little
sure ill be right up
to anne hes all right
i like him
he sees two figures pass above in a proscenium alcove first mrs
schuyler then grayson
he makes an elaborate bow to each and is impressed by graysons return bow
he can bend
anne takes a step backwards and sits down with him on one of the divans
camera tilting down with them
he puts an arm about her
come here baby
anne starts fussing abstractedly at stews tie
i havent seen you for three hours
youre neglecting me already during her speech she has been picking away at a stain on his tie
stew looks down and notices it
whats the matter
something i et no doubt
egg marks the spot you ought to get some new ties stewart
i dont need any new ties
ive got another tie ive got another one besides this one
and its a pip too
theres only one thing wrong with it
you know what that is
it has a little weakness for gravy and once in a while it leans a little toward ketchup
of course thats only in its weaker moments
when you move down to my place ill show it to you
anne is somewhat taken aback at the suggestion that shes to move into his place
oh its great
of course it doesnt compare with this coliseum of yours here but twill serve mlady twill serve
elaborate the architecture has a little feeling of missouri gothic and the furniture sort of leans toward oklahoma renaissance with a tiny touch of grand rapids
gently insistent dont you think its silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house when we
you mean youd like to have me live here in your house
anne cuddles closer into his collar
we can have the whole left wing and be all by ourselves all the time
stew is slightly dazed
he is slightly dazed
cynically we could have the whole left wing
wouldnt that be nice
would that be room enough for us
seriously missing his sarcasm oh darling of course it would
if it isnt there are six rooms and two baths but if that isnt enough mother will give us the blue room too i think
oh mother will give us the blue room
you havent a red room have you
well bless her heart
wouldnt that be nice
my oh my six rooms and two baths and a blue room
i guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it wouldnt she
but we dont need it im sure
i see we wont need that
plenty of room plenty of room
he gets up and paces the floor
he looks at anne and sees that she is taking him seriously
he drops down beside her
dropping his kidding look anne youre not serious about this are you
of course i am stewart
now lets get this settled she cuddles closer tweaking his nose
you have the cutest nose ive
never mind my nose
what kind of a chump do you think i am
you think im going to live here in your house on your dough
what do you think my friends would all say
dont be silly
id get the razzing of my life for that
a bird in a gilded cage thats what id be
oh no not me
what do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat
it isnt cheap
cuddling closer listen stew baby lets not talk about things like that now wait a minute
ill do anything you ask me anne but i will not live cuddling closer and stroking his nose oh i love that nose
its such a sweet nose
nevertheless whether the nose is sweet or not im not going to live in your house
you may as well get that straight
they kiss again longer
you do want me to be happy dont you
then im not going to live in your house they continue to kiss as
in bed asleep all curled up his head on his arm
camera trucks back showing the magnificent bedroom with carved wooden panellings a raised canopied bed
the clothes that stew has taken off the night before are draped haphazardly about the room
when the camera gets to a point that takes in a long shot of the room the door to the hall opens and a correctly attired valet appears
he closes the door noiselessly goes over to the windows and draws the brocaded drapes aside
then he crosses to a covered object and with a small flourish removes the cover revealing a birdcage
he approaches the bed
as dawson the valet stops beside the bed
the valet leans over and speaks distinctly
smith sir there is no movement from the form on the bed
still no response
the valet taps the bedclothes shrouded shoulder gently
smith sir sleepily stew turns his eyes heavy with sleep
how do you like your bath sir
i like my bath all right
how do you like your bath
stew peers up puzzled
who are you
surprised im your valet sir
dawson is the name sir
youre my what
your valet sir
stew still stares at him
then he nods to himself thinks he gets the idea
stew kicks back the covers and sits on the edge of the bed in his pajamas
still sitting on the edge of the bed he starts to slip his feet into a pair of slippers
the valet bends on one knee to help him
thank you thank you thank you
ill do that for you some time
thats very sweet
say listen what did you say your name was
was i very drunk last night
stew rises and starts to reach for a dressing gown but again the valet beats him to it holding it for him and helping him slip into it
i must have been pretty much plastered if i hired a valet
oh but you didnt engage me sir
stew surprised turns on him quickly
who did engage you then if i didnt engage you
what are you doing with my pants the valet picks up his pants
did you take anything out of those pants
oh no sir
what are you doing fooling around in here
miss schuyler i mean mrs
smith she engaged me this morning sir
stew pulls out a cigarette
the valet without missing a beat leans over and offers a light
a wary stew accepts
smith engaged me a valley huh
thats very nice of mrs
smith to engage me a valley
stew walks over and gets a cigarette out of a box on a small table waving his hand in a gesture of dismissal
the valet is right behind him holding up his bathrobe for stew to step into
putting on the bathrobe say you are nice
youre all right
youd make a good wife
thank you sir
but not for me
though i like you well enough
youre a nice fellow
youre all right
but im sorry i dont need any valleys today
the valet pays no attention to him but walks around the room picking up the clothes that stew has flung about
oh but indeed you do sir if you dont mind my saying so
a gentlemans gentleman as it were
someone to draw your bath lay out your clothes help to dress you its really most essential sir
stew with his cigarette between his lips stands watching the valet as he retrieves the various articles of cast off clothing
the valets manner is somewhat patronizing
he walks over to a chifferobe and starts opening the drawers preparatory to laying out fresh things for stew
suddenly stew stalks over to him takes him by the shoulder and yanks him around to face him
the valet is astonished and somewhat alarmed at the belligerent expression on stews face
over sweetly are you trying to tell me that i need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up
now im sorry
i appreciate your efforts
but i dont need anybody to help me button my pants ive been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right and i can button em with one hand as
a matter of fact
smith now please stew is rapidly losing his temper
youve got a nice face dawson you wouldnt want anything to happen to your face would you
the valet puts a bewildered hand to his face
oh no sir stew releases him with a definite motion toward the door
all right outside
bewildered i beg your pardon sir
gesturing violently outside
the valet gazes at stew as if he thinks the man is insane
he is considerably alarmed
i think i understand sir
you mean you want me to go
smiling admiringly there you are
you caught on
you see youre nice and youre smart too
you caught on right away
and dont come back
the valet starts edging toward the door
stews eyes bulge as he notices the birdcage for the first time
wait a minute whats this
thats a canary sir
thats a canary
who brought that in here
go on get that out of here
get that out of here
frightened yes sir
very good sir
ranting a bird
a bird in a gilded cage
get that thing out of here
the valet hurries off carrying the birdcage
as he nears the door there is a light tap on the door connecting stews room and annes
the door opens and anne comes in wearing a ravishing and revealing negligee
she carries a small jewelers box in her hand
she crosses the room toward stew
good morning darling
she looks over and sees dawson at the hall door
oh dawson see that all mr
smiths clothes go to the cleaners this morning please will you
the valet bows
stew looks at her blankly
very good madame
he closes the door discreetly and goes out
as they hug
say who is this mug
anne sits down on the rumpled bed
ive got a present
shut your eyes
keep em closed
i know youre going to love them
eyes closed feeling the package little couldnt be an automobile could it
he opens the package well well
aint that nice
he holds them up expensive garters
do you like them
got my initials on them too
theyre nice little things what do you do with them
you wear them of course silly
i havent worn these things for years
i know that
besides id look foolish
i couldnt look gallagher in the face
darling i dont care whether you can look gallagher in the face or not but youre gonna be a good boy and wear garters
honey i love you
ill eat spinach for you
ill go to the dentist twice a year for you
ill wash behind my ears for you
but i will never wear garters
his arms go about anne
under the force of his embrace anne sinks back on the pillows
stew leans forward looking down at her
nose to nose
adopting a sing song oh yes you will my dear oh yes you will my dear youll wear garters and youll like it too
picking up her sing song oh no i wont my dear oh no i wont my dear ill wash behind my ears but no i wont my dear
he bends to kiss her again but she gently resists and continues the sing song
oh yes you will my dear oh yes you will my dear youll eat spinach but youll wear garters too
oh you cant carry a tune you cant carry a tune all you are good for is to sit and spoon spoon
oh no i wont wear garters oh yes you will wear garters they melt into each others arms
general activity as before
camera trucks down the main aisle until it centers on stew at his desk sitting low in his chair his feet cocked up on the corner of his desk reading
a newspaper camera trucks up closer centering on his feet on the desk
one trouser leg is pulled slightly up and reveals a garter
stew reading the newspaper
it is opened up before his face
insert headlines about a three column article as stew reads this he looks very glum and depressed
a reporter the one stew had socked with a wad of paper in an earlier sequence shambles past and stops abruptly staring at stews feet
insert of what he sees
the socks are strangely taut
the reporter glances up and sees that stew cannot see him and then carefully lifts stews trouser leg a few inches
insert stews feet and legs
as the reporters hand lifts the trouser leg the fancy solid gold garters are on full display
the reporter stares at them goggle eyed
he can hardly contain himself at the sight of the garters
he looks off cautiously psst
one or two other reporters hear him and look over curiously
the reporter looks very mysterious and important and makes a motion for silence and caution
they get up and cross on tip toe to join him
the men around stew
they quietly gather around his feet and the reporter who made the discovery proudly displays his find
one or two more step by and all stare
stew still has the paper up in front of his face
is it real
of course its real
any diamonds on them
musta set him back at least six bits
camera behind him and shooting over his head
he is suddenly attracted by this unusual conversation and lowers his paper revealing the group of six or seven men in a huddle round his feet
one just cant wear those and be decent
yes you can if you belong to the four hundred
i wonder what number he is
stew flares in anger
several of them are bending low to get a close peek
with a violent gesture stew kicks his foot forward and sends a couple of them sprawling
stew gets to his feet
go on get out of there
whats the matter with you mugs
didnt you ever see a guy with a pair of garters on before
the two reporters who have done most of the talking scramble to their feet
the second reporter speaks in mock perplexity
what do you suppose he wears them for
can it be possible to hold his socks up
effeminately you know ones hose look horribly untidy when they hang loose like dont you think so percifield
stew gets up as his phone rings
he pays no attention to it
hank another reporter answers
same effeminacy yes my dear chap they look ghastly they look ghastly
get out of here
he starts out when hank calls to him hey stew
indicating phone your policeman
stew comes back and frowning picks up the phone
stew at phone
oh hello dear
wait just a minute to reporters hovering around come on
beat it will you
this is my wife
in your respective chapeaux and over your cauliflower ears
ad lib teasing comments as they exit scene she is lying on her stomach on a rubbing table as used by a masseuse
we see a considerable part of her back on which a middle aged swedish masseuse is industriously working
anne has the telephone in her hand
throughout her scene we hear very telling whacks into phone but its nearly six oclock darling and you know how long it takes you to dress
pause but the ambassador is coming at eight and youve got to be ready by the time he gets here
two footmen stand at either side of a huge iron gate
cars and limousines are arriving dropping off guests in evening wear
gallagher is just entering
smythe holds door open for her
id like to see miss wilson please
who shall i say madam
miss gallagher of the post
moss and fontana are doing a beautiful tango
guests scattered around the room watching interestedly
gallagher is still waiting
smythe enters leading miss wilson a refined looking girl of or so her hand extended
miss gallagher of the post

schuylers social secretary

yes of course
miss ramsey telephoned me

the camera moves with them as they start for the reception room
thats a lovely dress
pause where is mr
oh you mean ann schuylers husband
hes probably very tired
you see hes had to meet all these people personally tonight
you newspaper people have a lot of fun with him dont you
what is it you call him the cinderella man
moss and fontana are just finishing their dance
gallagher stands in doorway with miss wilson watching them
excited voices comment on the dance
miss wilson beckons to gallagher to follow her
camera trucks with them as they weave in and out of crowd
miss wilson points out celebrated guests to her
theres the spanish ambassador
gallagher steals a glance at the celebrated gentleman
you know he looks like one
miss wilson laughs delightedly
at this point they are interrupted by a butler
miss wilson yes
smith would like to see you
to gallagher will you excuse me
make yourself at home for just a moment please
miss wilson follows butler out of scene
gallagher is left alone
she wanders about the huge ballroom peering here and there searching for stew
finally she comes to a large open french door and steps out
several groups of men and women are seated at tables
gallagher enters from ballroom glances quickly at all the men
disappointed at not finding stew she crosses terrace and descends broad stone steps and advances into garden
stew his head cupped in his hands is seated on a stone bench
gallagher wanders into scene
she sees stew and stops
stew does not move
gallagher with a happy smile on her lips moves closer to him
stew suddenly becomes conscious of someone near him and looks suddenly up
he sees gallagher his face breaks into a happy grin
smith ive read some of your plays and id like an autograph
if it isnt my old friend
turn around gal
lets get a look at you
there you are
well daughter of the slums how did you get out of the ghetto
im pinch hitting for our society editor tonight
i wanted to see some life in the raw
aw you wanted to see some life in the raw huh
well gal im afraid we aint got no raw life up here
well ill have to look someplace else
maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies or perhaps some slightly fried pansies or better still some stuffed shirts
and guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck
fixing his tie say whos been tying your ties lately
it looks rotten
he suddenly realizes theres something different about gallagher
he takes a step back so as to look her over carefully blinks his eyes
gee gallagher do you look good
what are you doing to yourself
what did you do to that hair
and where did you get that dress
i dyed one and washed the other
enthusiastically oh you dyed one and washed the other
you certainly look good
anne is walking in direction of stew and gallagher
she stops suddenly when she sees them
her body stiffens
from annes angle
gallagher is facing in the direction of anne
dont turn around now but theres a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us
staring at us
my mistake shes glaring
must be my wife
he turns sees anne
it is my wife
dont go away
stay right there because im going to bring a friend up i want you to meet
standing as before
she is looking off with slightly narrowed eyes
stew and gallagher come up to her
anne prepare yourself for the treat of your life
this is gallagher
sure my pal on the paper
shes subbing for the society editor tonight
anne turns an acid smile on the uncomfortable gallagher
oh yes of course
how do you do
gallagher this is mrs
anne winces slightly at this name
how do you do
there is a short awkward pause
bitter sweet you know stewart you failed to mention that miss gallagher was a very beautiful young girl
gallagher flashes a look at stew seeing that he fails to get the dynamite behind annes casually pleasant phrases
anne plunges ahead
her tone is unmistakable now
as a matter of fact you failed to mention that gallagher was a girl
surprised didnt i
isnt it funny
with a world of meaning yes isnt it
stew is beginning to realize that all is not well as it could be
you see we never look at gallagher as a girl he breaks off
with her eyes on gallagher no
what do you look upon her as
fumbling for words why down at the office we always look at gallagher as eh just gallagher thats all
camera pans quickly to close shot of gallagher
she tries to back stew up
not so comfortable herself they all consider me just as one of the boys
a deadly acid smile indeed
same kind of smile yes isnt it
anne takes stews arm drawing him away from gallagher
miss wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need miss gallagher
resenting the tone of dismissal thank you
ill go and look for her at once
goodbye miss gallagher
goodbye stew she leaves scene
stew turns and faces her
that was kind of a rotten thing to do anne
after all gallagher is my friend
the least you can do is be courteous to her
i thought i was very charming stewart
thats a lot of hooey
ill go and apologize
he promptly walks away from her in gallaghers direction
furious stewart please
she glares angrily at the departing stew
gallagher has just reached the ballroom when stew catches up to her
im sorry gallagher really i am sorry
reassuringly oh thats all right stew
as far as shes concerned im just part of the hired help
strange ive never seen anne act that way before
pause its funny i never thought to tell her you were a girl isnt it
the butler is just opening the door
bingy looking more disreputable than usual steps inside
hello there meadows
disapproving once over who is it you wish to see sir
i want to see stew smith
oh excuse me i mean mr
pardon me mr
smith is engaged
we are having a reception here this evening oh a party
jolly times and merry pranks
im a guy who loves parties
you know he is distracted by two elegantly dressed ladies strolling by
a beautiful pair of shoulders
but listen now as a favor will you please make it snappy laughing waters and tell stew smith i gotta see him because if you dont my whole familys going
ill tell mr
smith at once sir
have a seat
well i got a seat but i have no place to put it
the butler turns to leave then turns back his face expressing distinct disapproval
pardon me sir but ive heard that one before
stew and gallagher standing together
the butler is seen leaving the scene having just informed stew of bingys presence at the reception
to gallagher excuse me
i just want to make sure and see he doesnt take away any of the vases
starts to leave then turns back well well well
my little pal gallagher a girl huh
unexpectedly he bends to kiss her hand tenderly thats just to give you an idea that i know how to treat a gal
get fresh with me and ill sock you in that little nose of yours
ill be right back
gallagher is left staring at her hand wonderingly
bingy gets up from his throne chair and crosses into the doorway of the library opposite him
he stops by a carved low boy and curiously examines a large antique vase
stew comes in and stops with a smile as he sees him
bingy his hand on the vase looks up
stew walks over to him
referring to vase whats the matter bingy a little clumsy to get in your pocket
bingy sets down the vase and surveys him
i was just looking at it
pretty aint it
i was just looking for the price tag
bingy looks him up and down in silent insolent scrutiny
stew begins to burn
what do you want
i just blew over i wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman
sore would you like to have me turn around for you bingy
oh boy id love it
stew makes a complete turn and faces bingy again
appraisingly not bad not good but not bad
you ought to be able to fool about almost anybody
is that so
well have you seen enough or would you like a photograph
whats the matter
hasnt mama had you done in oils yet
singing just a gigolo
now get this mug
youve got the kind of chin i just love to touch
and if you dont get out of here im going to hang one right on it
bingy assumes a conciliatory attitude
take it easy
take it easy dempsey
just relax my boy relax and open your pores
stew glares at him
bingy goes on
i bring a message from garcia
the boss sent me over to offer you a job
he wants you to write a daily column on the tribune
skeptically yeah go on
its all right
you can write your own ticket
a hundred and fifty bucks a week
thinks a bit quietly ill bite
whats the catch
theres no catch
this is on the up and up
of course all you have to do is just sign the article by anne schuylers husband
taking in the doorway
the butler starts to pass by
stews eyes are blazing
well how does the old cinderella man feel about that
with a quick motion stew clips bingy on the jaw
bingy caught unawares reels backward
bingy describes a backward arc just as smythe the butler seeing he can be of service steps forward and catches him
well done sir
through his teeth thats what i think of it bingy
bingy sags in the butlers arms
the butler looks at stew inquiringly
to butler smythe the er gentleman is leaving
bingy is carried out
stew stands glaring after them
anne and her mother at the breakfast table
good morning mother
didnt i tell you that hed be marvelous
everybody thought he was so charming last night
i was so worried for fear hed knock over a vase or something
i must have acted like an idiot
notices the morning paper in annes hands what does it say about the reception last night
oh the usual thing
blah blah blah attended the blah blah reception and wore the same blah blah things
reproachfully stop it
youre behaving like the person youre married to
you dont have anything to complain about mother
he was all right last night wasnt he
i told you not to worry about him
it was a miracle
the man was ill or something
she suddenly notices front page of paper anne is reading
her face freezes in horror
screaming ah ah ah
frantically gesturing at paper look
the front page
anne turns paper and reads the article
i wear the pants says anne schuylers husband
its okay with me says anne
schuyler gets up
paces wildly about room
in a frenzy
i knew it
i knew it
i felt it in my bones
she is interrupted by the entrance of grayson who dashes into the room his eyes ablaze
in his hand he has a copy of the morning paper
tapping paper in hand did you see the papers
cinderella man grows hair on chest
this is the most terrible kind of publicity that could possibly interrupting dont you think i know it grayson
as smythe the butler enters with tray smith send for mr
er smythe send for mr
as he turns to go double strength
muttering as she exits scene cinderella man grows hair on chest
close behind contemptuously i wear the pants says anne schuylers husband
stew now dressed in a business suit comes from the direction of the stairs and stops just before he gets to the door of the drawing room
from within there is an ominous silence
stew looks longingly in the direction of the front door then back at the drawing room squares his shoulders and goes in
as stew stops just inside the doorway
he had been prepared for this but it strikes terror into his soul just the same
from his angle in the doorway
the jury dexter grayson hands behind his back is standing gazing at stew with a fishy eye
schuyler stares haughtily
anne is crying softly
stew looking around at the gallery of faces
then he forces a jaunty smile to his face as he starts to enter whistling as he goes
good morning everybody he gets a cold frigid silent reception well maybe it isnt a good morning huh
to anne anne did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you
have you seen this
shows him newspaper yes the worm
i beg your pardon
hes a worm and im gonna step on him
to engage in a brawl
a cheap common brawl in my own home
i wear the pants
not even the trousers
ive tried to stop the evening papers but its useless
you quit trying to stop anybody well at best you might deny it
why deny it
the more you deny the more they print
let them alone
the thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut
ill take care of this guy bingy myself personally
sees anne crying now what are you crying about
is this true stewart
did you really say it
yes i said it
sure i said it
i didnt say it for publication however
and you struck him right here in our house
yes im sorry i struck him right here in your house
and ill strike anybody in anybodys house that calls me a cinderella man
well what else do you expect them to call you
burning thats the fourteenth crack youve made to me
im keeping count
when you get to twenty im gonna sock you right on the nose
as a matter of fact i ought to sock you right now
anne schuyler are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us
havent you any decency left
defending him why doesnt dexter show some decency
and you might show some too mother
what do you expect a man to do when hes called such names
to stew im glad you hit that reporter stewart
he deserved it
rising all right all right
its your funeral anne schuyler
she flounces out
grayson remains behind
to grayson go on beat it shadow
grayson turns to go then braves the last word
he leaves in a huff
stew puts his arms around the crying anne
six or eight people of distinction scattered around the room
all dressed in full evening clothes
among them is grayson anne her mother and one man in aviators uniform
the men have their coats and hats in their hands the women have their evening wraps on
apparently they are ready to leave for someplace and are being detained
an indistinct murmur of ad lib conversation is heard
on smythe the butler as he approaches mrs
pardon me madam
they phoned through from the mayors committee to remind you its past the hour for the reception
are the cars ready
theyve been ready for the last half hour
including captain white a young handsome aviator
modestly i hope i dont have to make any speeches tonight anne
oh you cant disappoint all the women
after all it isnt every day they get to see a famous round the world flier
yes i know but they scare me to death
this is the fourth dinner youve taken me to this week
im running out of material
are you complaining
yes there are always too many other people around
anne its getting late
what are we waiting for
were waiting for my husband lightly concealing her irritation if youll excuse me ill run up and see what the slowpokes doing
to aviator ill be right back she starts out climbing stairs to stews room
stew stands in front of a mirror fumbling with his dress tie
he pauses his hands still on his tie
were all waiting for you
wheres your valet
i poisoned him
stop trying to be funny and get ready will you
as he struggles with his collar it springs off
im not going
what are you talking about
im talking about im not going out
controlling her anger what am i going downstairs and tell those people
go downstairs and tell them anything
tell them im not going
tell them im not home
getting angrier by the minute stewart would you mind telling me why youre not going
yes ill tell you for the same reason ive never wanted to go out with those social parasites those sweet smelling fashion plates
i dont like them
they bore me
they give me the jitters
do you know youre talking about my friends
yes im talking about your friends and they still give me the jitters
well are you going or arent you
stew makes a move to embrace her
anne come here
listen sternly slipping away from him look out for my lipstick stewart
ill tell you what
lets you and me sneak out all by ourselves interrupting are you crazy
think of the fun we can have well sneak down the back stairs and get in the valets ford
will you stop being silly stewart
trying hard ill tell you what lets do ill take you and introduce you to all my gang
would you like that
hard but i dont want to meet your gang
i dont mean the newspaper fellows that you dont like
another gang i know youd love them
theyre writers and musicians and artists a great crowd of people people who do great things
people who are worthwhile
meaning my friends arent worthwhile i suppose
oh theyre all right anne
but i interrupting belligerently thats exactly what you mean
heaven knows youve made that clear to me often enough
well im sick and tired of it
ive given you party after party ive taken you to some of the best houses in this town and introduced you to people of importance and are you grateful
you insult them and act like a bore
im sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that youve done
perhaps its just as well youre not coming tonight
maybe i can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you and what youre going to do
with which violent declaration she flounces out of the room leaving stew staring after her angry and hurt
impulsively he follows her to the door a retort on his lips
when he gets there however she has vanished
he returns to the room wanders about thoughtfully extracts cigarette from box fumbles it walks to window stares out turns back to room heaves a lonely sigh
he notices his reflection in the mirror and gestures toward it
and that my friends is what is known as the society belle telling ex star newspaper reporter to go to how have you been mr
as stew sits in a typewriter chair
he rolls up the sheet in the machine so that he can read what is already written
strumming of guitars are dimly heard
he studies it for a moment frowning in dissatisfaction
he leans back in the chair and looks up for inspiration
of stew smith pacing the grand foyer
seen from overhead he is dwarfed by the surroundings
he tries hopscotching on the pattern of the floor
that wears thin quickly
supremely bored stew gives a shout and is rewarded with a cavernous echo
smythe the butler then appears nervously crouched behind some grillwork
did you call sir
smythe come here
i want to talk to you
smythe looks unenthusiastic
come on smythe talk to me
smythe im going nuts
im going nuts in this house
come on im not going to hurt you
come on whats the matter with you
stew gives another shout and is rewarded with another loud echo
this coaxes smythe out from behind the grillwork
do you hear something
you try it
reluctant me sir
smythe gives it a timid try
give it more volume
smythe gives a more satisfactory yell
stew nods approval
smythe begins yelling and shouting in earnest
no thats enough
i just wanted you to get the idea
now you know
this house is haunted
incredulous no sir
have you looked in the closets all over
found no skeletons
its haunted just the same
smythe has heard enough
he turns to leave but stew grabs him
smythe what do you do with yourself i mean when youre not carrying those double strength what do you do with yourself
well sir i putter
i mean when youre alone and want to amuse yourself then what
i just putter
hmmm you just putter
do you have to have a putter to putter
oh no sir
i putter with me hands
well isnt that nice
you just go right ahead and putter with your hands
thats all right
how do you do it
well sir ill show you
he demonstrates touching objects on a table and blowing dust off a lampshade
thats puttering sir
well well well
thats all right if you like it
can anybody do that
oh no sir
some people are natural putterers
others can never master it
you mean some people are born and never will become putterers
oh my wouldnt that be tragic
to know that you could never be a putterer
how about me
do you think if i concentrated and put my whole soul into it that some day i might be a putterer
you could never be a putterer
not a good putterer sir
well if i couldnt be a good putterer i wouldnt want to putter
what makes you think i couldnt be a good putterer
well sir to be a putterer ones mind must be at ease
a person with a problem could never be a putterer
for instance sir a fish can putter in water but not on land because hed be out of place
an eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage because hed be restless and unhappy
now sir if you will pardon me with all due respect sir as a smythe to a smith you are an eagle in a cage
a bird in a gilded cage
thats all i wanted to know
stew rushes off upstairs
smythe gives the echo one last try
as stew makes a telephone call
hello gallagher old pal
how are you old pal
a simple room probably in a boarding house or cheap hotel
gallagher is on the phone
a typewriter stands nearby
oh hello stew
im pretty good cant complain
hows our gentleman of leisure
stew at phone
im on the coast of norway and i cant get out will you come and get me out of the coast of norway
gallagher at phone
oh your play
hmmm act one scene one coast of norway and then a lot of blank
is that it
stew at phone
come on dont be silly
pause all right if you feel like you need a chaper one call up hank
youll find him at joes no doubt
hank would be my idea of a perfect bodyguard
pause sure you would
i knew i could depend on you old pal
snap it up will you gallagher
gallagher at phone
she hangs up joyful at the prospect of seeing stew
she hums softly to herself as she picks up the receiver again
bell ringing stew comes out of the library
smythe is going down the hall
stew intercepts him
smythe ill get this
im expecting some friends
very good sir
at entrance door
stew enters and opens it
gallagher and hank enter
glad to see you
how are you
fine but kinda thirsty
come right in ill get you a drink
okay you remember joe
i sort of invited him along to bend an elbow
you dont mind do you
its all right
bring him in
joe appears in the open doorway
stew sees him
come in joe
its all right
hello kid how are you
glad to see you
stew starts to close the door
just a minute johnsons outside
you dont mind if he comes in and dips a beak do you
no no bring him in
the more the merrier
come on in
johnson appears in the open doorway
stew sees him
hello stew old pal
how are you
glad to see you
come in kid
stew starts to close the door
wait a minute
i got two of the boys i brought along they were cruising around with nothing to do
you dont mind if i bring them in
you brought two of the boys
thats all right
bring them in
whats the difference
the two enter followed in a single file by men and women all of whom greet stew as they enter ad libbing hellos and hand shakes
stew stares at them dumbfoundedly
they swarm into the hallway and overflow into the rooms on either side
the butler stands aghast at this invasion
stew starts to close the door when three or four more troop in shouting cheery greetings
stew regards them in amazement
as he watches them file past
im sorry nobody could come
the rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition but theyll be down later
now hank are you sure theyre coming
it will be lonesome without them
to smythe smythe take this crowd in there and give them a drink
and find out what the boys in the back room want
smythe gulps nervously as he is dragged off by the revellers
the gang have taken seriously stews suggestion that they make themselves at home
they have draped themselves about the place a couple are strumming on the piano and others are inspecting the room in awe struck attitudes
smythe is being propelled around the room by the revellers
it isnt done gentlemen
it isnt done i say
it isnt done
well gallagher you certainly took no chances did you
im sorry stew
i asked hank and hank did the rest
hank brought them all
thats all right
well give them a drink and throw em out
as smythe passes by being propelled by revellers smythe
give them one drink and throw em out
dazed yes sir
bingy pokes his head in the door wearing a false beard
spotting him is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana
no its just little bingy baker
stew rolls up his sleeves preparatory to launching a punch
warningly uh uh
bingy dons a pair of glasses and points to them meaningfully
he enters cautiously watching stew warily
striking a pose big chief bingy come to white mans tepee to make friends
big chief very sorry
to show how sorry will bend over and let white man kick big chief where sun never shines
excuse me gallagher
i wouldnt miss this one for the world
he bends over and stew winds up and delivers a hard kick to his backside
bingy straightens stiffly then removes a bottle of alcohol from the target area
fire water all right
he takes a drink both start laughing
well stew thats all thrashed out
by golly im surely glad to see that youre not really sore
you know our racket after all news is news
thats all right
that was a great story bingy
a great story wish id printed it
i gave you the breaks didnt i
that hairy chest story
indicating bingys false beard youve raised it up to the chin i see
laughs go on in the other room and get yourself a drink
bingy emits a war whoop and proceeds into the drawing room where smythe is still being held hostage by the party
gallagher and stew
you know what i should do with you
i should sock you right in that funny little nose
yes and id love it
sure youd love it
he draws her out of the entrance hall and the camera moves with them as they head upstairs the party around them going in full force
stew and gallagher enter
apparently they have been talking about stews play on the way upstairs
how far have you gotten
well ive just been able to get off that norway coast so far
stew gestures toward the typewriter from which a sheet of paper is protruding
gallagher crosses to it
she rolls up the sheet so she can read what is typed on it
reading act one scene one a street in old madrid she turns as stew walks over to her
smiling well youre not getting your play done but youre certainly covering a lot of territory
grins havent i covered some territory
it feels like ive been on a cooks tour some place
stew standing before her
seriously stewart have you ever been to old madrid
grinning in spite of himself been where
gallagher to old madrid
never even been to new madrid
then how do you expect to write about it
oh draw on my imagination i suppose
did conrad draw on his imagination
stew is brought up with a start
what do you know about conrad
i dont know a thing about him but isnt he the one youre always yelling about
stew is noticeably impressed with this point of view
gosh you look cute
gallagher warms up to her subject
isnt he the one that always writes about things only the things he knows about
didnt he go to sea before he wrote about it
then why dont you write about something you know
write about yourself and anne
the poor boy who marries a rich girl now theres a swell theme
gee thats an idea gallagher
thats an idea there
i wonder now
shed make a beautiful heroine
warming up he puts arm around gallaghers shoulder and theres her mother and what a character that old dame would make with her double strength and that lawyer friend of
theirs hed make a great villain and theres you
smiling what could i be
you could be something
inspiration striking he dashes to the typewriter ive got an idea gallagher
lets get this set
thats a great idea for a play
pal get me a cigarette will you
here you are
all right thanks
now lets see
how will i start
hey pal how would you start
shooting through into the drawing room
it is many hours later
the members of the party including smythe are pretty well lit
on the floor of the entrance hall a dice game is in progress
in the drawing room four or five are hanging over the piano singing the grasshopper jumped over another grasshoppers back
in general a large time is being had
as the scene opens a door bell is ringing
a key is heard in the lock
the outer door starts to swing open
one of the party guests very wall eyed now and carrying a whiskey bottle in his hand staggers toward the door
it opens wider and anne and mrs
schuyler and dexter grayson stand gasping in the opening
the guest comes up to them
starting to close door say you cant come in here this is a private party
anne pushes the door violently which sends the guest sprawling
he stays where he lands holding the bottle in both arms across his chest
anne and her mother advance into a close shot and look off with incredulous horror and amazement
on a drunk bingy as he peers at them from an alcove above
recognizing grayson hey my old classmate from harvard
schuyler hello mama
most are too cock eyed or too engrossed in the ongoing crap game to notice them
i know whos the cause of it all
one of the men wanders in from the drawing room in time to hear this conversation
he assumes an attitude of exaggerated courtesy and gallantry as he bows before them
anne and her mother are almost bursting with fury
they spot smythe across the room thoroughly in his cups
to butler smythe
smythe who are these people
smythe comes stumbling up a grin plastered on his face
thoroughly plastered friends of mine
very lit lit literary people
confidentially to mrs
schuyler hes drunk
aghast smythe youve been drinking
proudly i have
confidentially very drunk
indignant where is mr
well for crying out loud i dont know
and i dont care
he jubilantly exits scene
confidentially very very drunk
stew gets to his feet as an idea strikes him
now gallagher if we could only get a great scene a tremendously emotional scene some
thing that would just wring the hearts out of the public to bring the curtain down in the second act that would be okay
couldnt dig one out of your hat some place could you
nope afraid im all out of tricks tonight
now weve got it right up to where the boys wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters hows that
at the partially opened door into the hall
it opens wider and anne looks in
she stares in horrified amazement
gallagher her shoes off sprawled out on the chaise longue stretches luxuriously and yawns
camera pans to stew at the typewriter hair mussed coffee pot and cups prominent the dressing gown over the back of his chair
neither of them has seen anne
she gasps as she quietly steps further into the room
gallagher caught in the midst of a grand stretch sits up abruptly startled
she stares uncomfortably off at anne
at the typewriter
he glances up momentarily and very absently and goes right on typing
absently oh hello anne he types furiously
tight lipped good morning
what does this mean
stewart looks up surprised at the tone of her voice
what does what mean
gallagher sensing scene starts hastily looking for her shoes
one of them has been shoved under the chaise longue and she has to get down on her hands and knees to retrieve it
anne comes in and confronts them her hands on her hips
oh that mob downstairs
i guess i got so interested in the play i forgot all about them
have we got a play anne
oh have we got a play
of course most of it is gallaghers
she did most of it
that brain of hers just snaps like that all the time
he indicates by snapping his fingers
gallagher quietly gathers up her things apprehensive of the storm about to break
coldly im not interested in the way her brain snaps
stew stares at anne as gallagher her hat in her hand her coat over her arm starts for the door
i think i better go stew
i think you should miss gallagher
wait a minute gallagher
gallagher stops transfixed by the new tone in his voice
he comes over to anne
whats the idea anne
the idea is simply this that i want those people to leave here immediately
now wait a minute
arent you being a little unreasonable
have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs
do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom
now wait dont get excited anne
theres no reason for that
perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink
thats all right
ill go right down and throw them out
thats no reason for you to take this attitude
after all i certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house havent i
pointedly your house
getting the implication after a pause o o oh i get you
a knowing chuckle all right
i dont blame you
i kinda forgot myself for a moment there
thats what i call getting me told isnt it anne
anne remains silent
thats exactly what she has done
i suppose ive been boarding out this past year
he takes his coat off back of chair and slips into it
quietly grimly all right ill tell you thisi dont like your boarding house lady as he gathers up loose manuscript he continues
and if its all the same to you im moving out
hotly this is something i should have done a long time ago only i didnt have sense enough to do it
no i had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that i knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning
but no more
so thats that
you cant walk out of here like this
throughout the scene stew is gathering his things togetherand probably packing an overnight bag
oh i cant
whos going to stop me
id like to see somebody stop me
if you think im going to stick around this joint just to look at this mausoleum not on your life
youre going to make no stuffed shirt out of me
now what do you think of that
schuyler stalks majestically in
whats going on here
who is this woman
snappily joan of arc
whats it to you
the mans insane
sure im insane but ive got some good news for you
points to himself this magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint
this bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on
and that is what is known as telling the mother in law
gallaghers cry of joy is cut off by an icy look from mrs
stew is stuffing things into a bag
heatedly to anne youve done nothing but watch me watch me
ever since ive been here
treated me like a thug watched me like a hawk mistrusted me
every time i leave the house that jane indicating mrs
schuyler goes out and counts the silverware
i dont blame her
i know im out of my own crowd
i should have had better sense in the beginning
but ill stay in my own backyard from now on
youre acting like a child
all right im a child
have it any way you want
but im going back to my own apartment where i should have lived in the first place
but no i got to listen to you and move here
if you want to live with me anne okay
but the sign outside will say mr
stew smith and youll have to be mrs
stew smith or theres nothing doing
no more anne schuylers husband he has his bag all packed by this time
he snaps it shut viciously lifts it off the chair picks up his hat and notices mrs
schuyler staring open mouthed at him
schuyler pointedly and heres some more news for you
you can take your red room your green room your left wing and your right wing and you know what you can do with them
to gallagher come on gallagher
he brushes by mrs
schuyler and anne exiting
exasperated oh stewart
stew and gallagher appear coming through the iron gates
as stew and gallagher move off down the street a ragged old panhandler comes wheedling up to them
pardon me could you spare a dime for a cup of coffee
stew is struck by a sudden idea as he regards the bum intently
how would you like to be a knight of the garter
no stew raises one foot then the other and quickly removes the solid gold garters which he presses into the bums surprised hand
as he removes the garters just a minute
to gallagher entertain the gentleman gallagher
to the panhandler there you are my man with those you can eat for a couple of months
he walks away leaving the bum staring dazedly at the luxurious pair of garters
an afterthought how about the socks
as stew and gallagher pass the camera and go down the street arm in arm
as they get past the camera stew is seen to square his shoulders and throw out his chest
he shakes first one leg and then the other as if he were throwing off shackles
stew and gallagher moving along
gallagher has a peculiar expression as she glances at stew
she has been deeply affected by the scene she has just witnessed
stews face is very thoughtful
comfortingly i wouldnt worry too much about it stew
shell see it your way
snapping out of it oh im not worrying about her im worrying about that second act curtain thats all
gallagher stares at him realizing he is thinking more about the play than his split up with his wife
then she breaks into a grin
why youre just a first class chump
you just staged a scene that would play like a million dollars
how about that declaration of independence for the second act curtain
stew stops stock still and stares at her
almost reverently thats an idea gallagher a great idea
gallagher happily links her arm in his and again they move down the street
on it is being typed act
inexpensive but comfortable
stew is in his shirtsleeves
a battered old typewriter stands on the table with a sheet of blank paper in it
stew is seated in a chair before it and is picking out the letters typing
he pauses running up the roller to regard what he has written
gallagher in a little apron is frying some ham and eggs
she looks up as she sees stew from the doorway
how about my breakfast
how do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach
itll be ready in a minute
accusingly never mind that
if you cant get my breakfast ready and cant get here on time in the morning then you can go get yourself another job
in mock contrition sorry boss dont be sorry
just get the breakfast thats all
there is a knock on the hall door
stew crosses and opens it
as stew opens the door
it reveals dexter grayson in the little hallway immaculately clad as usual
stew regards him in frank surprise for a moment
puzzled holy jumping swordfish
i suppose you know why i came
no i have no idea unless some of the silver ware is missing
now dont be absurd smith as he brushes past walking inside may i come in
surely come right in
as he sits down thanks
may i sit down
surely sit down
if i had known you were coming i would have thrown you up a waffle
i dont eat waffles
grayson sits stiffly on one of the grand rapids chairs
stew remains standing and waits silently for grayson to speak
grayson clears his throat
anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce
with enlightened expression she did
uncomfortably she wants me to arrange the financial settlement
listen grayson ive got bucks and cents in the bank
now anne can have any part of that she wants but shed better hurry because im spending it awfully fast
interrupting you dont seem to understand
anne doesnt expect anything from you
overcome by curiosity at the sound of voices she leaves the frying eggs and goes quietly to the doorway and peeks out
grayson and stew
we should like to know how much you would want to stew stares off incredulously
interrupting wait a minute
do i get from you that she wants to pay me alimony
thats putting it crudely but stew starts advancing nervously toward him
grayson a bit alarmed rises
closing in on him remember what i told you about that twentieth crack
all right youve just made it
before you go unconscious i want you to get this through your nut
i beg your pardon
you know when you dont know anything
your natural state
there are some people you cant buy their self respect for a bucket of shekels well i happen to be one of those guys
showing kitchen door open a crack
gallaghers eyes are glistening as she watches and listens
stew and grayson
weakly we just thought that snaps dont think
let me do all the thinking
now you go back to that schuyler outfit and tell them that i didnt marry that dame for her dough and i dont want any of her dough now
i was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married so im giving her a divorce for a wedding present
now stand up
grayson does so completely intimidated by stews manner
stew grabs him by the lapel
and now for that twentieth crack stew punches grayson on chin and knocks him through the open door into the hall
he slams door shut
stew thrusts his hands into his pockets and walks thoughtfully back to the typewriter
stew standing staring down at the typewriter
he is still flushed with anger
suddenly a thought strikes him and his face breaks into a broad grin
he sits down quickly and begins pounding away
gallagher enters from the kitchen carrying a platter of ham and eggs and a coffee pot
she sets them on a small table and this is spread with a cloth
then she crosses over to stew
pretending ignorance who was that
without looking up from his typing grayson annes lawyer
what did he want
gallagher that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act
they sit at the little table
what was the idea he gave you
stew dives into the ham and eggs
its a swell idea gallagher
the wifes family lawyer comes to see the kid see to talk over the divorce
then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony so the kid gets sore socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out
hows that for the beginning of the third act huh
well from now on the play will be easy
all you have to do is bring the wife back have her say shes sorry and then your plays over
he looks over at gallagher with a peculiar expression
vehemently as he scoops out some melon whats the matter
do you think im going to let that guy go back to his wife
not on your life
hes got to go to the other girl
she almost drops her coffee cup in a wild gleam of hope as she looks back at him
gallagher tries hard to keep her voice steady
not sure of herself what other girl
the little obrien girl of course the one you suggested in the story
ecstatic but still fighting but thats ridiculous
you cant make a sudden change like that
gallagher what are you going to do tell me how to write a play
theres nothing sudden about that tensely hes always loved the girl but he was such a sap he didnt have sense enough to tell her
well thats all right we can fix that
go to the little obrien girl and here ill show you
he gets to his feet and comes around to her
gallagher watches him a bit uncertainly
tenderly he goes to the little obrien gal and he says to her in some pretty words of some kind something that you can write hell say as if reading
part very emotional darling im sorry
ive been a fool all my life
ive always loved you only i didnt have sense enough to see it
as quick as i can get a divorce from my wife i want you to marry me
then shell look at him that way yeah then theyll embrace or something like that
they draw closer then hell kiss her or something
to demonstrate the point stew takes her in his arms and kisses her
they hold the kiss longer than is justified
stew is swept away by his sudden emotion and clings to her desperately while gallaghers arms instinctively go around his neck
gallagher chokes back tears that persist in coming
she stifles a sob
stew folds her in his arms
tenderly whats the matter gallagher
whats the matter
gallagher buries her face in his shoulders
