cruel intentions by roger kumble by roger kumble based on the novel les liaisons dangereuses by choderlos de laclos february we circle around the island of manhattan moving closer and
closer till were looking down on fifth avenue
as the melody continues to play we move towards a building and zoom into a window
a fifty year old female therapist dr
greenbaum sits at her desk frowning as she takes notes
books of jung and freud line the shelves
a young man sebastian valmont sits in a chair in front of her looking impatient
the therapist continues to write notes
weve been at this for six months
and you havent made an ounce of progress
sebastian takes out a cigarette
not looking up theres no smoking in my office
sebastian sneers at her then puts the cigarette away
greenbaum finishes her notes and looks up at him shaking her head
what do you want me to say
that im supposed to feel remorse because i act the way i do
the truth is i dont
greenbaum shakes her head and takes notes
sebastian contd look im not like all the other kids in high school
i dont care about book reports and extra credit
teachers are idiots anyway
the only challenge out there for me is women
you see a girl you like
you pursue them
you move on
but you said you have the worst reputation
dont you want to change that
let me tell you something doctor
chicks love a guy with a bad rap
they say they dont but they dont mean it
they all think that theyre the ones that are going to save me
the trick is to let them think its true
i think thats all the time we have for today
same time next week
this is going to be our last session
i like spending time with you
you know youre quite attractive for a woman your age
you have killer legs
this isnt a joke
your parents spend a lot of money to send you here
im trying to help you
dont be insecure doc
youre a big help
sebastian picks up a book of freud
sebastian contd he was a coke addict you know
you think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me
it doesnt work sebastian
it works a little
no it doesnt
i see right through you
i hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase
its going to get you into trouble
well you dont have to get nasty about it
sebastian approaches a photo on her desk and picks it up
my daughter rachel
dont even think about it
rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman who happens to be attending princeton this fall
shes way too smart to fall for your line of b
care to make a wager on that
good luck sebastian
what nervous im going to win
would you please leave
sebastian puts on his glasses and leaves
greenbaum contd asshole
the doctor stews for a moment then reaches into her desk sifts through some papers where she finds a pack of benson hedges and lights one up
she looks at the photo of her daughter then hits the speaker phone and dials
greenbaum contd rachel its mom
rachel doctor greenbaums daughter sits at her desk crying while holding the phone
honey is something wrong
rachel cries for a moment
he told me he loved me and i believed him
who told you
you dont know him
im so stupid
she continues to cry
alright honey just calm down take a deep breath and step out of the circle
would you cut the psycho babble bullshit mom
theres pictures of me on the internet
monitor a nudie web sight
the title reads ivy league bound
beneath the caption is a photo of rachel tied to a bed and smiling with a princeton banner covering her privates
what kind of pictures
nudie pictures what do you think
jesus christ how can you be so stupid
i dont know
he was just so charming
all he did was talk about how i had killer legs and how we wanted to photograph them
things just got out of hand from there
she hears the phone drop mom
are you there
doctor greenbaum bolts out of her office and spots sebastian standing in the elevator
you son of a bitch
doctor greenbaum races down the hall pushing several people out of her way
sebastian stares at her expressionless as the elevator doors close
greenbaum contd youre gonna pay for this you little shit
you hear me
a dentist peers outside of his office to see whats going on
he exchanges looks with doctor greenbaum
greenbaum contd fuck off harold
a meter maid is writing a ticket on a car when a porsche pulls up in front of the townhouse and parks in a red zone
sebastian steps out of the car and walks up the steps to the townhouse
you cant park there
sebastian turns to her and sneers
he takes out a wad of money and shoves it in her breast pocket before entering the townhouse
close on a tuna on a chopping board
a butcher knife comes down on the tuna cutting its head off
close on two hands ripping open the fish
close on two hands rolling a chunk of tuna into a rice roll
close on two hands which carry a lavish tray of sushi through several doors until we enter the final door leading into a enormous living room by manhattan standards with
a view that overlooks the park
eclectic art from around the world emphasize the valmonts passion for travel
sook hee the valmonts housekeeper sets a tray of sushi in front of kathryn merteuil a seventeen year old porcelain skinned wasp with all the grooming you could want in
an east coast child
she sits with a forced smile on her face and listens attentively as bunny caldwell a forty year old nouveau riche socialite talks incessantly
cecile caldwell her beautiful teenage daughter sits by her side
she wears a t shirt with a koala bear on it
i cant tell you how happy we are that cecile is going to be attending oakwood with you this fall
youve always been an inspiration to beau and i on raising her
we just hope she can rise to the high standards which youve set for her
ill do my best
sook hee pours a dish of soy sauce in front of kathryn
kathryn contd to sook hee in vietnamese thank you sook hee
that will be all
sook hee leaves
what was that
i was thanking her
vietnamese is such a beautiful language
caldwell contd kathryn is a straight a student at oakwood as well as being president of the french club
listen to whatever she has to say and youll go far
in french youre too kind
how do you do it
i mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school
where do you get your strength
i know this sounds corny but whenever i feel temptations of peer pressure takes out her crucifix turn to god and he helps me through the problem
call me an anachronism but it works
what are the boys like
cecile is that the best you can do
to kathryn you must forgive her kathryn
shes never been in a co educational atmosphere before
dont worry its totally understandable
most of the boys that matriculate at oakwood are very upstanding gentleman however there are the occasional bad apples
like your step brother sebastian
i cant believe they didnt expel him after what he did to the school nurse
i hear shes recovering quite well
caldwell turns to see sebastian standing in the doorway
he walks over and takes a seat
sebastian contd nice to see you again mrs
you remember my daughter cecile
my what an adorable shirt youre wearing
my father just took me on a trip to australia
how are things down under
blossoming i hope
ceciles attending oakwood in the fall
what year are you in
im what you would call a fifth year senior
but i thought high school is only four years
it is unless youre a fuck up like myself
he winks at cecile
i think well be going now
to kathryn thanks for all your help
kathryn stands and approaches cecile
ill call you later and well get together and plan your curriculum
to sebastian nice meeting you
lets go cecile
cecile follows mrs
caldwell out the door
kathryn closes the door behind them
do you care to tell me what mrs
white trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house
im just taking the poor girl under my wing
kathryn sits on the sofa next to sebastian
she unscrews her crucifix
the top part becomes a small spoon and the bottom part a small vial of coke
kathryn contd the parental units called while you were out
how is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying bali
zipping through my inheritance per usual
hopefully though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid
kathryn uses her crucifix as a coke spoon and snorts a bump
kathryn contd whats wrong with you today
therapy not going well
it was fine
he leaps off the sofa and starts to pace
sebastian contd im sick of sleeping with these insipid manhattan debutantes
he walks over to the wall where nude botticelli hangs
sebastian contd nothing shocks them anymore
he scratches the nudes pubic area
sebastian contd im beginning to feel like im losing my touch
he kisses it
oh poor baby
well you can relax
i have a mission for you
court reynolds an aryan seventeen year old preppy wears a polo sweater with an american flag
you know court reynolds son of garret reynolds
kathryn steps into frame and embraces him
she is wearing the same sweater
he kisses her forehead and messes up her hair
you mean the nazi who dumped you over fourth of july weekend
kathryn throws a sushi at him
sebastian catches it
he didnt dump me
we had a parting of the ways
sebastian stares her down
kathryn contd alright he dumped me
he smiles then swallows the sushi
a drunk court sits in the drivers side and takes a final swig from his flask
he quickly passes out
i went to great lengths to please court
huge sacrifices were made on my part to keep him happy
kathryn rises up into frame looks at court and scowls
she spits on him then wipes her mouth
what do you think
kathryn sprays her mouth with binaca
in any event my feelings were hurt when i learned that he had fallen for someone else
you dont mean
cecile turns toward the camera while eating a double scoop ice cream cone and wearing a mickey mouse club hat
none other than cecile caldwell
she takes a lick of the ice cream which falls off the cone
she mouths the word shoot and stomps her feet sebastian snickers
i dont find this very funny so thats what this is all about
imitating kathryn well get together and plan your curriculum
keep your friends close and your enemies closer
when i get through with her shell be the premier blow job queen of the tri state area and poor little courts heart will be shattered
why go through cecile
why not just attack court
because if theres an attack made on court it could be traced back to me
i cant allow that to happen
everybody loves me and i intend to keep it that way
i see your point
though why should i care
i need you to seduce our young cecile
introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery
shes quite cute you know
young supple breasts a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie
sebastian watches kathryn rub herself
he licks his lips
kathryn contd be her captain picard valmont
boldly go where no man has gone before
sebastian places his hand over kathryns as she continues to rub herself
he thinks for a moment then i cant
kathryn throws his hand off of hers
oh come on kathryn
its too easy
but i thought high school was only four years
i mean please
she knows nothing
shes seen nothing
i could have her under the table at au bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived
go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it
i have a reputation to uphold
oh but diddling the therapists daughter is a challenge
that was just simple revenge
what i have planned requires sheer genius
he takes a magazine and throws it on the table
kathryn picks it up
its the latest issue of seventeen
im not interested in the latest dating tips from jonathan taylor thomas
shut up and turn to page
she turns to the page
insert magazine article the title reads a virgins manifesto
why i plan to wait until marriage by annette harrison
kansas city missouri
jesus christ is she for real
ive read it over and over again
this babys the real deal
daddys little angel
a paradigm of chastity and virtue
what do you plan to do
fly to kansas and woo little dorothy
it just so happens were not in kansas anymore
our little angels father has accepted the new headmaster position at oakwood
shes staying with my aunt up in connecticut while daddy sells his house
can you imagine what this would do for my reputation
screwing the new headmasters virginal daughter before school starts
it will be my greatest victory
you dont stand a chance
even this is out of your league
care to make a wager on that
ill think about it
oh well duty calls
time to add another chapter to my work of art
he holds up a leather bound journal
oh gee your journal
could you be more queer
could you be more desperate to read it
sebastian stands to leave and heads to the door
about that little wager of yours
kathryn contd count me in
what are the terms
if you lose then that hot little porsche of yours is mine
and if i win
she approaches him
ill give you something youve been jerking off about ever since our parents got married
be more specific
whispers in his ear ill fuck your brains out
what makes you think id go for that bet
thats a seventy thousand dollar car
because im the only person you cant control and it kills you
sebastian sneers at her
kathryn contd do we have a deal
no way that car means everything to me
she kisses him and licks her tongue over his lips
whispering you can put it anywhere
baby talk it would feel so yummy
sebastian hesitates then shakes her hand
kathryn contd happy hunting
we move across the sky looking down at lush greens and stately mansions till we pass over the rosemond estate
enormous in size
we see two riders on horseback
angle on the two horseback riders
one a woman of seventy
this is helen rosemond sebastians aunt
the other rider is a beautiful seventeen year old girl
the one and only annette harrison
its a beautiful home you have here mrs
thank you annette
chance hill has been with my family for over sixty years
does your family do much riding
my mother and i used to ride a lot before she got sick
im sorry about that
my grandpa used to breed horses on his farm so i would come over and ride all the time
im familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid west
whats his name
doesnt ring a bell
annette throws her a concerned look
aunt helen contd in any event i want you to consider this your home for the time being
its so peaceful and quiet around here
a shotgun sounds in the distance
annette contd what was that
sebastian must be here
aunt helen gallops down the ridge followed by annette
sebastian stands holding a shotgun
a groundskeeper franklin stands by the trap
the target soars into the air sebastian contd die motherfucker
he fires the gun missing the target
sebastian contd shit shit shit
franklin shakes his head
we hear a cat meow
sebastian perks up
sebastian contd kitty
he quietly reloads his rifle
we hear the cat meow again
sebastian searches for the cat
sebastian contd puss puss puss puss puss
he raises his rifle and takes aim
he lowers his rifle and turns to see aunt helen and annette riding over to him
aunt helen dismounts from her horse and they hug
sebastian contd ive been looking all over for you
god ive missed you
ive missed you too
how are your parents
theyre coming back next week
i write them everyday
she strokes his cheek lovingly
sebastian this is annette harrison
shes going to be staying with me for a few weeks
i guess that makes two of us
he extends his hand and they shake
sebastian contd to aunt helen why dont you head in and whip us up some of that ice tea of yours
well take care of the horses
anything for you my dear
sebastian climbs on aunt helens horse
aunt helen contd stay out of trouble you two
he smiles at annette and beckons her to follow
sebastian and annette put the riding gear away
so what year are you going into
got a boyfriend back home
i dont know
relationships seem too distracting
id rather concentrate on my studies
you a lesbo
she bends over to pick up the saddle
she sighs disgusted then turns toward him
are you often this offensive on a first encounter
i was just being honest
you happen to have a nice ass
she shakes her head and continues with her chore
i read your teen beat manifesto
i must say i found it rather appalling
thats a first
most people praised me for it
most people are morons
i mean who are you to knock what youve never experienced
i wasnt knocking anything
its just my belief that people shouldnt actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch
with those emotions
youve slept with several women
are you happier because of it
how do you know ive been with several women
a friend wrote me
pissed well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip
i didnt mean to upset you
but you still didnt answer the question
an uncomfortable silence falls between them who the hell is taking the time to write letters spreading this shit about me
its not really important
fine forget it
its obvious that were not going to be friends
why are you being so dramatic
look ive got a lot of problems and im trying to deal with them and the last thing i need is people spreading shit about me
alright i said i was sorry
beat can we start over again
i think weve gotten off on the wrong foot
she approaches him and they shake
annette contd annette harrison
she smiles but before he releases her hand sebastian contd so tell me annette
im curious since youve never had sex do you touch yourself
she whisks her hand away and storms out of the stable
sebastian contd what did i say
close on a hand stroking the bridge of a cello
thats good thats good
cecile sits in front of a cello
next to her sits ronald clifford a well mannered fifteen year old african american
holding his own cello he is giving her a music lesson
ronald contd now lets try the a minor scale
cecile attempts the a minor scale fucking up badly
kathryn enters and shudders in silence
ronald contd once more and remember the third note is flat
cecile tries again and once again screws up
oh i suck
take a deep breath
cecile takes a deep breath ronald contd youre concentrating too much on your bowing
let it flow
he stands and sits behind her
ronald contd here let me help you
he places his hand over hers
ronald contd now close your eyes and lets try again
she closes her eyes and they repeat the scale
it sounds much better
ronald takes the moment to study ceciles face
its obvious hes smitten with her
on kathryn who watches from the door
a grin crosses her face
ronald replaces her other hand and plays a beautiful bach sonata with he and cecile sharing the bowing
he closes his eyes as the music takes over him
now cecile opens her eyes and gazes into his
the feeling is mutual
on kathryn she accidentally bangs her hand onto a table which causes a metal tray to fall to the ground
ronald and cecile look up as kathryn replaces the tray im sorry
i didnt mean to interrupt
your playing was beautiful
ronald quickly stands and moves away from cecile kathryn this is ronald clifford
hes giving me music lessons over the summer
ronald approaches and shakes kathryns hand
pleased to meet you
likewise im sure
ronald is one of the few high school students attending juliard
hes composing his first opera
its based on the life of doctor martin luther king
doctor king is my favorite
ronald shakes his head but laughs
cecile looks at him and smiles
kathryn rolls her eyes
i guess our hours up
same time tomorrow
another nice home in connecticut
sebastians porsche is parked outside
a typical teenagers bedroom expect this one is a shrine to herb ritts homo erotic art
blaine tuttle oakwood preps resident drug dealer and open homosexual sits at his desk separating pot seeds from his stash
sebastian paces behind him
some fag no offense none taken wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me
any ideas who it could be
blaine if i knew who it was that person wouldnt be alive right now
where did you say shes from
who the hell do i know in kansas
the football stud
hes from kansas city
i wouldnt be surprised if he was your rat
it would make sense
mcconnell hates me
i fingered his girlfriend at the game last year
i dont think that bothered him
what do you mean
lets just say greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field
are you shitting me
i shit you not
mcconnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month
wed go at it for a while then as soon as hed cum he starts freaking out
you know imitating greg what are you doing man
im not a fag
ill kick your ass if you say anything
beat its like for christsakes greg youre gay deal with it
the only reason why i let him continue with his charade is because hes got a mouth like a hoover
too bad hes in kansas this summer
football team started practice last week
hes already called me to hook up
you think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf
i do believe bravo is showing spartacus on television tonight
dont think its not going to cost you
just make sure your front door is unlocked
shall we say the stroke of midnight no pun intended
sebastian hands blaine two hundred dollar bills
kathryn and cecile sit on a blanket
a lavish picnic lies around them
kathryn wears large sunglasses a scarf and a hat to protect her from the sunlight
she sits behind cecile and braids her hair
so rumor has it that you went on a date with court reynolds
i hear hes very nice
giggles he kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over fourth of july
what a loser she must be
beat anyhow courts invited me to the hamptons for labor day weekend
you think so
i dont know
i guess im just scared
what are you scared of
ive never even gone to first base with a guy
what do i do
havent you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends
its not gross
how else do you think girls learn
here turn around and face me
cecile turns and faces kathryn who removes her glasses
kathryn contd now close your eyes and wet your lips
are you for real
do you want to learn or not
it still sounds gross
cecile does as instructed
kathryn leans in and kisses her on the mouth
see that wasnt so bad
it was nothing
lets try it again only this time im going to stick my tongue in your mouth
when i do that i want you to massage my tongue with yours
thats what first base is
cecile closes her eyes
kathryn leans in and kisses her again only this time longer
she continues to kiss her then gently pushes her tongue into ceciles
cecile does as instructed and they start to make out
kathryn eyes look towards the ground where ceciles hands are now clutching the grass
kathryn smiles and continues her seduction
she places her hand on ceciles thigh and moves it under her dress
cecile lets out a soft sigh
kathryn breaks from the kiss
they look at each other and smile
kathryn contd not bad
that was cool
maybe you should try it on your friend ronald sometime
what are you saying
oh come on cecile
hes crazy about you
is it that obvious
cecile contd he sends me letters you know
thats so romantic
have you responded
well do you like him
i dont know
cecile we just made out in the middle of central park
you can trust me
beat i do like him
i cant stop thinking about him
cecile starts to cry
kathryn hugs her
cecile contd what am i going to do
if my mother found out about ronald she would kill me
kathryn grabs her and looks her straight in the eye
listen to me
your mother must never know
did you hide the letters
theyre in this antique doll house in my room
i want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me
cecile if theres one thing im great at its love letters
with my help hell be eating out of the palm of your hand
perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house
youd do that for me
of course i would
were friends right
cecile kisses her on the cheek and hugs kathryn
little touches of annettes life photo of dead mother adorn the room
annette is reading the fountainhead when she hears singing coming from outside
unable to concentrate she walks out onto the balcony
annette steps onto the balcony
sebastian lies in a floating pool chair sipping a cocktail and listening to his walkman and singing beethovens ode to joy in german
calling out excuse me
you talking to me
look i know this is your house and all but do you think you couid keep it down
im trying to read
skeptical youve read the fountainhead
im not as dumb as i act you know
when howard roark makes love to dominique francon
most romantic scene in all of literature
he rapes her
thats a matter of opinion
you need help
why dont you come join me for a swim and well discuss it
at this hour
i dont think so
oh come on
quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool
gee with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse
give me a minute
ill be right down
she re enters the guest room
sebastians cell phone rings
he answers it
kathryn sits in her bathrobe
one foot soaks in a small tub of water while sook hee tends to her other foot
fuck her yet
im working on it
call me later
she hangs up and lights a cigarette
sook hee accidently jabs her toe
that hurt you stupid bitch
kathryn kicks some water in her face
annette comes down wearing a bathrobe
she sits by the pool as sebastian treads water away from her
holding out the letter you know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible
another letter from your friend
this is my favorite part
reading the letter even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating
he has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention
every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it
you know you could at least have the decency of telling me whos badmouthing me so i might have the opportunity to confront them face to face
how do you know its not some girl whos pissed off at me for breaking up with her
i sincerely doubt it
give me the fucking letter
annette smiles and tears the letter up
sebastian contd why did you do that
the last thing i need is you going into my room searching for this while im away
mocking is that the last thing you need
my your clever
she takes pieces of paper and sticks it in her bathrobe
she then stands and takes off the robe revealing a one piece bathing suit underneath
hows the water
she dives in the pool and surfaces
sebastian contd youre right you know
about what you said today in the stable
im not a happy person
i never said that
you implied it
look i didnt mean to give you a hard time
no its okay
i mean i look at you with all your morals and values and well you seem to be happy in your choices
i envy you
caught off guard thank you
seriously youre amazing
you have everything going for you
counts with his fingers youre smart youre beautiful youre determined
youre everything i want in a girlfriend
jokingly shut up
i wasnt kidding
id like to take you out
look im flattered but seriously it could never work
because you act like a pig
he swims towards her
do you deny that theres an attraction between us
i dont want to answer that
look were friends
you dont find me cute
come on look at these muscles
he flexes for her
im sorry but youre not my type
friends it is
i can live with that
he extends his arms out for a hug
she moves in and hugs him
her smile turns to a look of horror
its my house
she pushes him off her
whats the big deal
havent you ever seen your friends naked before
annette climbs out of the pool
get some manners
she walks into the house
sorry i didnt know you were peenaphobic
she flips him the bird as she heads into the house
sebastian contd oooooo naughty naughty
ten hail marys for you
beat good night
sebastians porsche is parked outside
sebastian presses his ear to the door
moaning oh baby
checks his watch right on time
greg mcconnell all american star football player for oakwood prep is busy getting his cock sucked by blaine who lies under the covers
near orgasm oh god
oh god im gonna cum
im gonna cum
the door swings open and sebastian enters
hey blaine did i leave my
greg throws the covers over his face
sebastian smiles and sits
he lights a cigarette
no movement from under the covers
greg is that you under the covers
from under the covers get out of here
sebastian stands yanks the covers off the bed revealing greg and blaine
i told you to lock the door
i thought i did
this was the first time ive ever done something like this
i was apathetic really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah
please dont tell anyone
this could ruin my career
what about your family
can you imagine the humiliation your fathers going to feel when he finds out his pride and joy is a fudge packer
hey hey hey
careful valmont hes not a fudge packer
cum chugger yes but not a fudge packer
to sebastian please
im begging you
ill do anything
lets just forget the whole thing
i cant help you there
its too good to pass up
greg starts to cry
sebastian contd after all it is you whos bad mouthing me to annette harrison
i dont know what youre talking about
come on greg
youre the only one who knows her
the truth will save you
sobbing i swear on my life i never said a word to her about you
i think hes telling the truth valmont
greg couldnt write a grocery list let alone a letter
alright i believe you
your secrets safe with me
greg wipes his eyes
sebastian contd however this whole incidents kind of turned me on
sebastian unzips his fly
sebastian contd you get my point
greg completely defeated crawls off the bed and over to sebastian
blaine shakes his head and smiles
greg places his hand on sebastians thigh when sebastian contd jesus christ i was only kidding
what do you think im gay
my god havent you had enough for tonight
our boy just cant get enough dick
you sick son of a bitch
blaine and sebastian laugh
ill leave you guys alone
macho voice score one for the team greg
sebastian leaves the room then re enters
sebastian contd come to think of it there is something you can do for me
annette jogs up a dirt road on her morning run
thirty yards behind her a golf cart drives off a meadow and lands on the road
sebastian is driving
annette looks back and scowls
sebastian catches up to her
need a lift
no thank you
how are you today
give it up
oh right last night
i guess i owe you an apology
im not going to speak to you till you realize that you cant intimidate me
i said i was sorry
she continues her jog
sebastian follows alongside
sebastian contd have a nice sleep last night
it was fine
i wish i could say the same for myself
i was up thinking about you all night
i thought we agreed that we were going to be friends
yes well unfortunately i cant just switch the on button to off
the sad fact of the matter is that youve unintentionally rubbed off on me
annette stops running and turns to him
and thats a bad thing
im trying to better myself but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away
im sorry but im not here to be your savior
well try this one on for size
i think im falling in love with you
you dont even know me
dont you believe in love at first sight
yes but only when its mutual
and this is far from mutual
do you think we could spend some time together this morning
im seeing a friend
thats none of your business
how about tonight
thats also none of your business
tell me what to do annette
how can i win your heart
ill do anything
i cant get you out of my mind
you truly want to do something to make me happy
and you promise to abide by it
beat i want you to leave and go back to new york
if thats a problem then ill make arrangements to stay with some friends
sebastian thinks for a moment
ill leave this afternoon
its not about being happy
you and i cant he shifts the cart into reverse and backs away
annette and greg walk along the beach and gaze out at the ocean
he told you hes failing in love with you
ive never known him to say those words before
i thought he said it all the time
thats not his style
one thing i can say about valmont
he always speaks the truth
annette looks lost
greg contd whats wrong
is there a mutual feeling between you two
i dont know
beat what else do you know about him
not a whole lot
we take some classes together
hes got a bad rep but its mostly bullshit
what do you mean
well a lot of people are jealous cause hes loaded
sighs i dont know
ive been hearing some awful things about him
i cant tell you
im sworn to secrecy
greg takes her hand
annette how long have we known each other

sebastian drives down the highway towards manhattan
he holds his cell phone in one ear
that nosey bitch

greg talks on a pay phone out of annettes sight

kathryn is sitting in front of the television scowling
ronald plays beethovens moonlight sonata at the piano while cecile listens and sways to the music
enough with the music

she throws a magazine at the television
sebastian bursts into the living room
you would not believe what shhh
that was beautiful
almost as beautiful as you
ronald checks his watch
well i guess its getting late

he approaches her awkwardly then shakes her hand
angle on living room kathryn freeze frames the image
whats wrong with you

ive recently discovered that our good friend mrs
caldwell is the one who sent the letter to annette urging her to stay away from me
i now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag
any luck corrupting her daughter
call cecile up and get her to come over
ill bust that cherry in a heartbeat
she walks over to the freeze frame image of ronald and cecile on the television
the plot thickens
it appears that cecile has fallen for her music teacher
ooo im sure mrs
caldwell will love that
not to mention court reynolds
unfortunately ronalds moving with the speed of a special olympic bobsledder
whats your plan of attack
i rat cecile out to mommy
mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship
but who will they turn to for help
kathryn smiles and sits on sebastians lap
cecile is planning to go away with court next week
ill need you to speed up her sexual awakenings
sebastian rubs her shoulders
im at your service
mmmm that feels good
youre so tense
sebastian moves his hand down her shirt and under her bra
hes met with no resistance
i hate when things dont go my way
it makes me so horny
i hate it too
he takes his hand out from her shirt and slides it under her skirt
sebastian contd baby talk oh baby your soaking
she closes her eyes and rubs his crotch
she unzips his fly
kathryn contd seductively any luck with your girl

she takes his hand out from under her pants
kathryn contd no pootie
kathryn contd sorry
a meter maid writes a ticket on sebastians car when she grabs her neck in pain
sebastian closes his window and sets down a bb rifle with an infrared scope
goodbye mister bond
he picks up the phone and dials
sebastian contd hi its sebastian

annette sits in bed talking on the other end of the phone
no not at all

it wasnt a date
hes just a friend
theres a moment of uncomfortable silence
well i was just calling to tell you i was thinking about you and i miss you
ill let you go
wait dont hang up
what are you doing
he crosses over to his circular bed where two scantily clad twins gretchen mora are licking popsicles
what are you reading
of human bondage
yeah its pretty relevant considering my situation
youre not gonna start that again
he takes out a bottle of baby oil and pours it on the girls butts
im through with my childish games when it comes to you
hold on thats my other line
to the girls rub
they rub the oil on each other then turn to him and smile
he clicks the phone back on
sebastian contd annette thats my mom calling

i weep for the future
a saleswoman approaches kathryn whos checking out an assortment of fur coats
the saleswoman holds up a beautiful dress
heres something you might like
kathryn examines the label
do you carry any real fur
all our fur is faux
how silly of me
the saleswoman smiles then walks away
kathryn sneers then looks over at a small child staring at her
kathryn contd mouthing the words fuck off
she shoos the child away when mrs
i got your message and came as quick as i could
i hope i didnt keep you from something
not at all
what about her
you promise you wont say anything to her
weve developed a friendship and
kathryn you have my word
it isnt drugs is it
i think theres something going on between cecile and her music teacher
shes so young and hes so black
kathryn reacts to her remark
hes been sending her love letters that she hides under her doll house
i questioned whether or not to tell you but something like this could destroy her reputation at oakwood and i dont want to see her get hurt
kathryn picks out an expensive suit and approaches the sales counter
kathryn contd i hope i did the right thing in telling you
id hate to see cecile ruin things with court
i cant thank you enough
you will be discreet about this
will that be cash or charge
kathryn looks through her purse
i left my credit cards at home
caldwell takes out her purse
let me get that for you
i cant have you do that
its the least i can do
caldwell hands the credit card to the saleswoman
kathryn turns to mrs
ronald gives cecile a cello lesson when mrs
caldwell bursts into the room
who the hell do you think you are
im paying you to give cello lessons
not to pervert my child
caldwell i think youre misunderstanding something
is that so
caldwell holds up ronalds letters
caldwell contd you care to explain this then
ronald and cecile exchange looks of worry
where did you find those
margarita found them while cleaning your room
those are my letters
dont you raise your voice at me
go to your room now
cecile turns to ronald
caldwell contd now
ronald nods and cecile runs out of the room
caldwell turns to ronald
caldwell contd how dare you treat me with such disrespect
i got you off the streets and this is how you repay me
got me off the streets
i live on th and park
you are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and i mean never to see my daughter again

ronald packs up his sheet music while mrs
first of all maam i never touched your daughter and second i would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines
oh dont give me any of that racist crap
my husband and i gave money to colin powell
sarcastic i guess that puts me in my place
thank you for the hospitality mrs
it was a true awakening
he storms off
ronald rides down in the elevator
angry took me off the streets
the elevator stops and the doors open
sebastian and kathryn stand in the doorway wearing shades
kathryn hands ceciles letter
ronald sits in a chair and reads ceciles letter
sebastian and kathryn watch
i never knew she had these kind of feelings
youre a lucky guy
eyes tear up she really loves me
sebastian and kathryn roll their eyes
ronald contd what do i do

ronald e mails for geeks and pedophiles

because we want to see cecile happy and we know you make her happy
she hands ronald a pen and paper
kathryn contd now you just march yourself into the study and start writing

ronald leaves the room
sebastian closes the door while kathryn picks up the phone and dials
who are you calling
sebastian hangs up the phone
kathryn contd what are you doing

she picks up the phone and he hangs it up again

what is that
oh my god its your conscience
she reaches out toward his temple plucks a handful of something throws it to the ground and stomps on it
kathryn contd court renolds is going down and if youre not going to help me someone else will
you amaze me

do you think i take great delight when i hear kathryn is so wonderful
kathryn is a model child
kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day
beat im the marsha fucking brady of the upper east side and sometimes i want to kill myself for it
no i dont enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer
so theres your psychoanalysis doctor freud

sebastian says nothing
kathryn picks up the phone and dials
kathryn contd hello cecile

she hands the phone to sebastian
now i need you to listen to me very carefully
i have a letter from ronald that he asked me to give to you
now i cant exactly bring it to your house since your mother despises me so heres what were going to do
the clock reads
a large collection of antiques and stuffed animals line the room and walls
cecile lies in bed eyes wide open
she crawls out of it dressed in sweats
cecile exits a building and steps into a waiting taxi
cecile lies on sebastians bed
she finishes the letter while sebastian fiddles with a camera
she hands the letter to sebastian who looks it over
you think hell like it

he points the camera at cecile and snaps a photo
what are you doing

cecile breathes a sigh of relief
he pulls her up to her feet

she closes her eyes then puckers up
sebastian takes the string holding up her sweats and pulls it open
cecile bolts up
what are you doing
you promised to let me kiss you
but pointing at her lips i dont want to kiss you here

sebastian points to her crotch
she moves her hands to her sweats and looks up at him
cecile pulls the string to her sweats
they fall to the floor
caldwell enters the room

caldwell contd cecile
she walks over the bathroom door and knocks
caldwell contd cecile

cecile stands in front of her mirror crying
she applies make up to several hickeys on her neck

he looks at cecile and strokes the shaft of his racket
cecile stands and rushes into the house

kathryn listens on the other end of the conversation
ill be there in a few hours
she hangs up the phone and smiles
a nurse escorts sebastian and annette down the hall
its really nice when the young people help out
most of our patients dont have any family nearby
they stop at a door and open it
an old man sits in his hospital bed
nurse contd mister gottlieb we have a visitor for you
sebastian starts to enter the room when the nurse stops him
nurse contd actually sebastian youre going to be spending the hour with mrs
the nurse escorts an unhappy sebastian down the hall
annette waves bye bye to him
annette sits by mister gottliebs bed and reads from a book of poetry
a senile mrs
sugarman sits in bed while sebastian does a newspaper crossword puzzle and ignores her
he smokes a cigarette and flicks the ash into her bedpan which lies next to her on the bed
did i ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me yes you already did
sebastian never takes his eyes off the paper
right after we played backgammon
we played backgammon

he turns to her and extinguishes his cigarette
i said do you want some water
no thank you
theres a knock at the door
annette and the nurse enter

sebastian smiles at annette who smiles back
sebastian and annette drive towards the estate

a smile comes over annettes face
she turns to him crosses her eyes and makes a face
sebastian looks over

she holds the face
sebastian starts to laugh
sebastian contd cut it out
he continues to laugh
she stops making the face

she reaches out and holds his hand
he squeezes it
cecile lies in the bed
theres a knock on the door

cecile bolts up and unlocks the door
kathryn stands there with a worried look on her face
kathryn contd are you okay
kathryn enters and locks the door behind her
cecile is crying

cecile waits a moment then whispers in her ear
kathryn contd he ate you out

cecile i think youre going to have a hard time crying rape if thats all he did
what do i do then
well did you like it
i dont know it was weird
at first it felt icky then it felt kind of okay
then i started getting really hot and then i started shaking and then like i dont t know
it felt like an explosion but a good one
cecile you had an orgasm
im so proud of you

cecile embraces her happy
now that youre on your way it would be stupid of you to stop
think of sebastian as a tutor
let him instruct you
i dont love him
i love ronald
dont you want to make ronald a happy pappy
practice makes perfect cecile
my advice is to sleep with as many people as possible
but that would make me a slut
beat wouldnt it
cecile everybody does it
its just that nobody talks about it
cecile takes the information in
its like a secret society
thats one way of looking at it
annette sits on the grass reading gabriel garcia marquezs love in the time of cholera
she puts the book down and wipes a tear from her eye
sebastian peers out his window with a pair of binoculars
kathryn enters his room
i just had a nice chat with cecile
i dont think shell be giving you anymore problems
who are you spying on
take a look for yourself
he hands the binoculars to kathryn who looks out the window
jesus she reeks of laura ashley
sarcastic oh shes crying
wittle babys upset by the big bad book
sebastian grabs the binoculars from her
whats your problem
shes really getting to you isnt she
if you must know yes
i dont know what to do
i cant stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet im completely infatuated with her
beat she made me laugh
and thats why youre losing your bet
im not losing the bet
its just taking longer than i expected
do you mind if i take my new porsche for a ride
kathryn the only thing youre going to be riding is me
now if youll excuse me i have some work to do
he storms out of the room
sebastian walks over to annette who continues to read her book
she notices him and sets the book down
am i bothering you
not at all
have a seat
he sits down next to her
dont tell me you finished the fountainhead already
he points to her book
sebastian contd great book

sebastian sticks his hand in his pocket and fiddles around
my friend monsieur philipe is a friend of florentino
whos monsieur philipe
you dont know monsieur philipe
sebastian takes out a sock puppet
sebastian contd low voice bonjour mademoiselle
laughs bonjour monsieur philipe
monsieur philipe voice you are very pretty
i would like to kiss you
the puppet kisses her on the cheek
sebastian contd monsieur philipe voice oooo that felt good
he kisses her on the cheek
monsieur philipe voice that felt good too
i will kiss you all over
the puppet attacks a laughing annette
she playfully grabs sebastian and starts to tickle him
sebastian tickles her back
they roll around on the ground until sebastian lands on top of her
a moment of tense silence passes and sebastian kisses her
the kissing intensifies until she pushes him off her
sebastian contd im sorry about that
i am too
he paces for a moment and his mood turns to anger
you know what
i dont take it back
why are you doing this
because im in love with you
i thought you said we were going to be friends
i cant handle it
i cant keep my feelings bottled up like you
can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me
i have feelings for you
then whats wrong
i love you annette
its not like you have a husband unless your married to jesus
thats not fair
why cant we be together
annettes eyes well up with tears
you really want to know
its because i dont trust myself with you
beat i took a vow and because of you im tempted to break it
dont destroy that for me
she hurries off
sebastian enters the room and slams the door behind him
he hears the shower running from the bathroom
sebastian enters the room
cecile sticks her head out from the shower curtain
want to join me
indifferent some other time cecile
he leaves the room
cecile looks confused
a moment passes and sebastian re enters taking off his clothes
sebastian contd what am i an idiot
sebastian and cecile lie in bed
sebastian smokes a cigarette and writes in his journal
am i suppose to be this sore
for the first time yes
a moment of silence
i like it better when im on top
this is what i like to call quiet time
this is time when we reflect on what weve done
she looks at the troubled expression on sebastians face
cecile contd somethings bothering you
is it me
no you were fine
he looks out on the balcony where kathryn is eavesdropping
they make eye contact and she waves
its that girl annette
he stands and walks over to the balcony where he closes the blinds
cecile contd you love her dont you
i dont love you either
i love ronald
im getting out of here
sebastian heads to the bathroom
where are you going
im taking a shower

good night cecile
under her breath prude
annette is reading in bed
theres a knock on the door
sebastian enters the room
i just came to say goodbye
where are you going
back to the city
i may take off to europe for the rest of the summer
i just cant handle it around here
i think thats for the best
good for you
i dont want us to end on bad terms
well im afraid you dont have a choice in the matter
you make me sick
youre a hypocrite and i dont associate with hypocrites
annettes eyes well up with tears
how am i a hypocrite
oh please annette
you spend all your time preaching about waiting for love
well here it is
right in front of you but youre going to turn your back on it
im sorry that were not at the age where we can get married
if we were id propose but thats not going to happen
so i guess were just fucked
ill move on but you
youre going to have to live with yourself knowing youve turned your back on love
and that makes you a hypocrite
sebastian heads to the door
sebastian contd have a nice life
annette races toward him and throws her arms around him
sobbing please dont go
get off me
she kisses him passionately
i want you
sebastian embraces her and draws her over to the bed
she lies down and starts to unbutton her dress
sebastian stands over her watches her
her crying does not let up as she continues to undress
sebastian stands stunned and watches her
im sorry i cant
a pained look crosses her face
sebastian leaves the room and closes the door
sebastian closes the door and leans against it
he wipes his eyes which are starting to water
he goes over to a mirror at looks at himself
sebastian contd get it together you pussy
a stern look comes over his face
he smiles then walks away
a cab pulls up to the house
the front door opens and a crying annette quickly leaves the house and climbs into the cab
she closes the door and the cab pulls away from the house
we pan up to a second story window where kathryn is looking down and smiling
sebastian lies sleeping in his bed
his journal lies beside him
a feather tickles his nose
he stirs awake and looks up to see kathryn staring down at him
howd it go last night
well i know how it went with cecile
she wont shut up about it
howd it go with mrs
sebastian sits up in bed
if your asking if i nailed her the answer is no
she shot you down
exactly the opposite
so what went wrong
i dont know
she was lying on the bed ready to do it but i i dont i was
i just didnt feel right about it
youre telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didnt
god are you a chump
a momentary lapse of judgment soon to be rectified
he climbs out of bed and puts on his robe
he starts out the door when if youre heading towards her room you wont find her
where is she
you dont know
big smile she left thirty minutes ago
whered she go
she wouldnt say
she apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends
beat you blew it sebastian
that girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again
sebastian throws off the robe and starts to dress
well see about that
a shrine to hot babes whos posters adorn the walls
greg is busy dumping muscle magazines several issues of teen beat and some musical theater cds into a trash bag when the phone rings
he answers it
sebastian is talking on his cell phone
is she with you
who is this
sebastian you faggot
is she with you
where is she
i dont know
why dont you leave her alone
mcconnell im gonna out your ass in two seconds if you dont tell me where she is
i told you i dont know
shes staying with some friends of her parents
she caught the train twenty minutes ago into grand central
you better not be fucking with me cause its your ass on the line
sebastian clicks off his cell phone
sebastian contd motherfucker
he bangs on his dashboard
the porsche weaves in and out of traffic on its way to the city
a group of passengers exit the train
annette is among them
she stops when she sees sebastian standing in the distance
annette stops in her tracks
she drops her bag rushes over to him and embraces him
sebastians cruel demeanor drops when he realizes how happy she is to see him
he looks her in the eyes and smiles
sebastian carries a laughing annette into the room
they continue to kiss and he carries her over to the table
he sets her down and accidentally knocks over a lamp
they both laugh
they kiss some more then start to unbutton each others clothes
sebastian struggles with her pants button
sebastian contd fuck this
he picks her up again and moves to the bed
they collapse on the bed and he accidently falls off it
sebastian contd suave
annette cracks up
sebastian reaches up and yanks her down on top of him
they both laugh then kiss
establishing shot annette sits on the windowsill watching sebastian as he sleeps
he slowly starts to wake and looks at her
she walks over to him and kisses him
sebastian contd you alright
i have to get going to my friends house
beat was it it was perfect
she smiles and holds her hand out
he takes her hand in his
annette closes the door to the bedroom and walks down the hall passing a mirror on the wall
in the mirrors reflection is kathryn looking very angry
sook hee carries a bundle of folded laundry down the hall
sebastian enters the hallway from his bedroom
he grabs her
you work way to hard
hands her a wad of money take the day off
sook hee smiles and moves on
sebastian continues down the hall
he passes kathryns door and hear noises
sebastian leans against the door
a little to the left
look pretend like youre writing the alphabet
mmm stay on b
sebastian knocks on the door
sebastian hears some fumbling then a door close from inside the bedroom
sebastian enters the room to find kathryn lying in bed wearing only her bathrobe
well you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldnt have invited me in
sebastian walks toward the closet
sebastian contd who is our little friend so inexperienced that you have to resort to the alphabet game
he throws open the closet door
ronald stands there covering his genitals with his hands
sebastian contd well well well
its not what it seems like
ronald picks up his clothes
as he leaves say hi to cecile
ronalds head drops as he closes the door behind him
calling out call me
sebastian throws kathryn a look
kathryn contd you cant have all the fun
sebastian sits on the bed
kathryn contd you seem to be in a good mood
a big grin appears on sebastians face you didnt
tell me all the details
oh come on
for her first time
thats the amazing part of it
i mean it wasnt like cirque du soleil acrobatics just standard missionary stuff but it was
ah forget it
im going to sound like a hallmark card
no tell me
it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part
so you made love
ooo i hear the birds chirping
mock mock mock
she places her hand on his crotch
so i assume youve come here to make some arrangements
some other time
im not in the mood
and thats why youre leaving

he leaves and slams the door behind him
sebastian talks on the phone

he hangs up the phone
kathryn stands in the doorway

kathryn starts to cry

at first it was but now its become something bigger
kathryn you know i love you
ive always loved you

kathryn sits down on his bed
she slips her underwear off from under her bathrobe and tosses it aside spreading her legs
kathryn contd alright come on lets get it over with
but mark my words this is the only time itll happen
she picks up the phone
kathryn contd whenever youre ready

thats not fair
youre taking all the fun out of it
then do me a favor and get rid of her
if not for me then do it for you
look at yourself
youre a joke
shes turned you into jelly
what do you want to be one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling
people used to respect you
they feared you and now youre going to throw that all away
sebastian stares at her lost in thought
kathryn contd poor sebastian
he used to be cool but now hes just another love struck faggot
one of the many
a taxi drives down the street
kathryn and sebastian sit in the back seat
her arm is around his
sebastian looks nervous
why so nervous
ive never done this before
how have you dumped girls in the past
i knew this guy last summer in the hamptons
he and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other
but she had this huge weight problem
his friends taunted him mercilessly about it
you know how do you breathe when she sits on your face
its embarrassing for you to be seen with her
finally he couldnt take it anymore and decided to dump her
she flipped and he went on the defensive
i distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again
im completely fucked up
im completely fucked up
im completely fucked up
beat poor fatty never had a chance
the cab pulls up to the curb
sebastian gets out and heads into the building
kathryn leans out the window
dont be weak
the cab drives off
sebastian rings the doorbell
a woman mrs
oshea answers the door

oshea contd calling out annette

sebastian closes the door behind him
annette enters the room
well im going to head back to the kitchen

oshea mouths hes cute to annette
annette smiles and nods
oshea leaves the room
would you like a tour
she takes his hand and leads him down the hall
they enter a guest room
and this is my room
she closes the door behind them
she smiles and kisses him
annette contd you think we can be quiet
she embraces him
sebastian remains lifeless
this isnt working out for me anymore
smiling yeah me neither
she looks him in the eye and can tell hes not joking
annette contd whats wrong
its not you its me
im completely fucked up

i love you
i wish i felt the same
unfortunately i feel nothing
i think it was just the conquest
sorry im completely fucked up
annette bursts into tears
why are you trying to hurt me
im just being honest
i just wanted to see what you were like in bed
she attacks him but he grabs her hands and fends her off
he pushes her against the wall and covers her mouth with his hand
sebastian contd shh
i dont think mrs
oshea would appreciate you acting like a total psychopath
she slinks to the ground and continues to sob
you dont know how to love
you dont even know me
the fact of the matter is there is some one i love
shes smarter prettier
you dont even compare to her
the only reason i am here is because she wants us to be exclusive
but you knew this was important to me
what your virginity
well thats over now
annette clutches her stomach and continues to sob
he moves towards her
he opens the door
im completely fucked up
he leaves and closes the door behind him
annette continues to sob
a cab driver carries several shopping bags out of a cab
kathryn walks down the hallway and enters her room
the room is dark
kathryn flips on the light
sebastian is sitting in a chair wearing his shades journal in hand
a little melodramatic dont you think
i have a flair for drama
mind if i ask what youre doing in my room
you wanted an answer to your question
he takes off his glasses
we can tell he has been crying
devastated beyond repair
i doubt shell ever trust a man again
he holds up a bottle of champagne
i thought we should celebrate
id love to but unfortunately im expecting some company
not that its any of your business but yes
sebastian holds up a letter
kathryn takes the letter
sebastian contd i havent had a chance to read it but im sure it goes something like yahdah yahdah yahdah you mean a lot to me
yahdah yahdah yahdah i hope we can be friends
etcetera etcetera etcetera
you see i expected your sort of bullshit so i took the liberty of phoning ronald and cecile
right now theyre having a little get together in my love shack at the grand central hyatt
im so sorry he chose cecile over you but i promised him i would see you through your crisis
now where were we
pop goes the champagne cork
sebastian contd oh yeah the celebration
he reaches down and picks up two glasses
he fills them and hands one to kathryn
sebastian contd what shall we toast to
to my triumph of course
not my choice of toast but its your call
to your triumph over annette
sebastian contd whats so funny
my triumph isnt over her
its over you
you were very much in love with her and youre still in love with her
but it amused me to make you ashamed of it
you gave up on the first person you ever loved because i called you names
dont get me wrong im flattered that you chose me over her but please understand i never loved you sebastian
youre just a toy
a little toy i play with
and now youve completely blown it with her
i think thats the saddest thing ive ever heard
she clicks his glass and drinks
sebastian doesnt drink
he looks ill
in any event you still owe me my reward
im sorry but unfortunately i dont fuck losers
sebastian slaps her across the face
kathryn contd you motherfucker
she grabs him and starts throwing wild punches
they fall to the ground
kathryn contd nobody hits me
he rolls on top of her and pins her to the ground
get off me
will you calm down
get off me
he stands and gives her a hand up
they both catch their breaths
im very sorry about that
now get out
we had an arrangement
didnt you hear what i said
i dont care what you said we had an agreement
youve slept with half of the borough so dont tell me youre being choosy
screaming get out
im giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed
and if i dont
then i will consider it a declaration of war
i think you have your answer
war it is
he grabs his journal leaves and slams the door behind him
sebastian paces while talking on the phone
its desperate that i talk to her
ive already told you shes not home
well please leave a message that i called
ill do that
he hangs up the phone and throws it into a mirror which shit
he collapses on his bed and buries his face in his hands
exhausted he looks up and sees his journal lying on the floor
he picks it up and flips through it
sebastian walks down the street carrying a small package
he enters an apartment building
sebastian rings the doorbell
oshea answers the door
what do you want
i need to talk to annette
shes not here
do you know where she is
do you know when shell be back
listen were entertaining some guests so annette
young man i already told you shes not here
could you please see that she gets this
he hands her the package
ill do that
its really important
she closes the door
mrs oshea turns away from the door towards annette who stands in the hallway
kathryn sits in a chair doing her nails
she checks her watch takes a moment and makes herself upset
she picks up the phone and dials
ronald is sleeping
the phone rings
he awakens and answers it
voice cracking ronald
ronald sits up nervous
is everything okay
hes out of his mind
what do you mean
i think hes high on drugs
he hit me then took off
im afraid to be alone
please come over
ill be right there
he hangs up the phone and grabs his pants kathryn hangs up the phone
she instantly becomes calm and returns to doing her nails
annette sits and stares at sebastians package
she picks it up and opens it
she takes out a journal and a letter
she opens the letter and reads it
thank you for reading this letter
i dont know what i can possibly say to rectify the harm i have caused you
for once in my life im at a loss for words
sebastian sits at his desk writing the letter
the truth of the matter is that being with you was the only time i have ever been happy
my whole life has been a joke
i prided myself on taking joy in others misery
sebastian walks the streets of new york
he seems sad and lonely
well it finally backfired
i succeeded in hurting the first person i loved
i wish more than anything i could take it back but i guess thats not possible
annette continues to read the letter
enclosed is my most prized possession
for a long time i considered it my trophy
a sordid collection of my conquests
if you really want to know the truth then please read it
no more lies
we pan down the side of the building to the ground
sebastian lies against the building waiting for annette to return
a car is picking me up tomorrow and taking me to marthas vineyard where we have a summer home
nothing would make me happier than if you joined me
im a fucking wreck without you
if youre interested please meet me outside my building at nine
if not i understand
ronald sits and listens as a grieving kathryn tells her story
and when i confronted him about his affair with cecile he told me it was none of my business
then when i said well what about ronald he said you were nothing more than a stupid
the n word and that you deserved what you got
and this happened before you and i hooked up
its been going on for a while
beat then he called me a disgrace to our family and thats when he hit me
racist piece of shit
id be careful if i were you
god knows what hes up to
he doesnt scare me
ill kick his ass in
will you stay here for the night
you can leave in the morning
thats when my parents get back and dont worry about it
kathryn hugs him
youre a good friend
a street cleaning machine drives past the apartment sebastian lies sleeping on a sofa in the lobby
the night doorman taps him awake
what time is it
you got to go
did she show up
do you mind if i check upstairs
i cant have you do that nor can i have you hanging around the lobby all day
thanks for letting me crash here
dont worry about it
sebastian stands and staggers out of the building
ronald walks out of the building and heads toward the corner
he stops when he sees sebastian crossing the street
under his breath son of a bitch
sebastian walks toward ronald who blocks his path
ronald contd sebastian
sebastian looks up at ronald
tired hey ronald
it seems that you and i have some talking to do
can we do it later
ive had a really bad night and ronald shoves sebastian
sebastian contd whats your problem
where the hell do you come off hitting women
what are you talking about

oh christ she got to you too
did you hit her
ronald you dont know what youre talking about
dont know what im talking about
i know that you fucked cecile
sebastian says nothing
ronald contd its true isnt it
ronald im sorry
ronald tackles sebastian to the ground
ronald lands on top of him and hits in the mouth
ronald contd i trusted you
ronald hits him again
blood pours out of sebastians mouth
sebastian is dazed
ronald grabs him by the collar
ronald contd i trusted you
sebastian takes a moment to catch his breath
he knees ronald in the groin
ronald screams in pain and falls over
sebastian climbs to his feet
sebastian contd why dont you give me a chance to explain
sebastian kicks him in the ass
ronald falls over
sebastian contd dont you get it
we were all part of her game
sebastian pins him to the ground
sebastian contd im gonna let you up but you have to give me a chance to explain
sebastian releases him and ronald catches his breath
sebastian looks up and sees annette standing across the street witnessing the event
sebastian contd annette
sebastian stands and races over to her blindly crossing the street
annette notices a speeding cab and pointing sebastian
sebastian looks up just as wham
the taxi hits him dead on sending him flying over the car and onto the street
the cab skids to a stop
annette runs into the street and over to sebastian who lies in shock he sees her and grabs her hand
she starts to cry
ronald and the cab driver run over to them
get an ambulance
the cab driver races back to his car
sebastian looks up at annette
annette contd were getting you to a hospital
annette contd youre gonna be fine
annette contd its alright
blaine twenty high school girls and several friends of the family are dressed in black making polite conversation and consoling sebastians parents and his aunt helen
caldwell stands in the corner with cecile and her husband mr
sad sad sad
to think of the opportunities that boy had
this should be a lesson to us all that our children need constant supervision
she puts her arm around cecile
its all about quality time
annette enters sebastians room now cleaned up
she walks around the room taking it in then approaches the window
she stares out of it for a moment
he loved that view
annette turns and sees kathryn at the door
she enters the room
i can see why
kathryn extends her hand
have we met
i dont think so
did you know sebastian well
you might say that
now i remember
your fathers the new headmaster at oakwood
im sure youre going to love it there

beat well ill leave you alone now
i just came in here to get something of mine
kathryn walks over to sebastians desk and takes the keys to his porsche
she goes to leave when she turns back to annette
kathryn contd you sure youre going to be alright
im here if you need a friend
look i know this sounds corny but whenever i feel like i cant go on i
takes out her crucifix turn to jesus and he helps me through the problem
call me an anachronism but oh cut the shit kathryn
you heard me
who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me
my brother is dead have some respect
kathryn i know all about you and sebastian
sebastian was a pathological liar
i wouldnt believe a word he i have his journal
he sent it to me the day before he died
everything about you is in it
the blow jobs the hand jobs the menages your bout with bulimia the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you
lets see then theres your coke problem

smiling i know
kathryn starts to cry
annette contd kathryn please
didnt you once say that crying is a sign of weakness
im very disappointed in you
kathryn continues to sob
annette contd alright stop crying
theres a bright side to this you know
annette puts a comforting arm around her
annette contd youre going to be my pet project next year
youre going to do what i tell you to do wear what i tell you to wear
youre going to befriend the unpopular sleep with the insecure
think of the social ramifications it will cause
you and i are going to turn this school around
and do you know why youre going to do it
beat cause your ass is mine
annette grabs kathryn by the face kisses her forcefully on the mouth then shoves her back
kathryn looks at her in horror
annette contd well be in touch
she winks at kathryn then leaves
close on kathryn
she sits down on sebastians bed utterly defeated
annette contd forgot something
annette steps back into frame and takes the car keys out of kathryns hands
annette races down the highway
she opens up the glove compartment and rifles through some cassettes
she takes out the carpenters greatest hits and inserts it
cue up the carpenters singing goodbye to love
annette reaches down and takes out sebastians sunglasses
she puts them on and checks herself out in the rear view mirror
a grin crosses her face
we move off the porsche and ascend into the air
the porsche weaves through traffic as it disappears into a sea of cars
