written by zach braff panicky through crackly los angeles tower this is transworld two two heavy we are going down
engines two and three are
tower this is maydayi mayday
through crackly radio heavy pull upt pull up
the radio noise is drowned out by the a capella soprano voice of a young indian boy as he sings a melodic hindi prayer
slow motion the plane is going down fasts everyone panics and screams in slow motion as the oxygen masks away like plastic pendulums
the soprano voice continues the prayer
andrew largeman large is the only passenger who remains unfazed
even as the flames from the wing echo fiery reflections on his cheeks even as the young mother seated next to him clutches her newborn and wails towards god even
as bags fall from the overhead compartment at half speed and the beverage cart slides down the aisle andrew largeman sits peacefully unaffected
he calmly reaches up and turns his air vent so it blows directly on him
he looks up to it bings as the light flashes on and off
the binging continues more and more frequently at first in rhythm with the prayer and then it dissolves into the ring of an whiteness
morning sun streams through a palatial picture window
the phone continues to ring
a ceiling fan spins above stacks of scripts a cell phone charging bare walls and a small human figure dwarfed by the enormous white bed in which he sleeps
his byes bounce back and forth under their lids as he dreams like theyre chasing each other in a game of tag
the phone is finally answered by the machine
larges eyes stop moving
this is your father
larges eyes slowly float open
hi hello its uh
look uh you dont call me back so i dont know how to do this
if i cant
if youre not gonna return my calls then theres no way for us to communicate
starts to cry look i dont know how to do
this but youre gonna need to come home now
last night uh
your mother died last night andrew
im so sorry
but she uh
last night she drowned in the bath
the machine cuts the voice off
larges eyes processing
they elide slowly left then back right as if scanning in data
he blinks again slowly
his eyelids float closed
he falls back to sleep
the rush of water from the bathroom sink
large appears to stare directly at us
his body is there but his mind seems absent
he reaches to the middle of the frame almost at us and pulls open both doors of the mirror hes been staring into
his face and chest are immediately replaced with the two dozen orange prescription drug canisters that immaculately line the shelves of his medicine cabinet
he closes the mirror doors and stares at himself
large rushes through throngs of people on their lunch break
he manages to avoid eye contact with all of them as he tries to find an address while checking a piece of paper
he boards an outdoor escalator and starts climbing thl stairs
after a moment he looks to his right through a window into a gym where a man on a stairmaster is walking alongside him
large registers something he isnt going anywhere
the camera pulls back to reveal hes been walking up on the down side
he stands still and lets it bring him all the way down where he moves to the up one and rises towards the next level
his expression never changes
a casting assistant sits behind stacks of headshots and manilla envelopes while the phone rings constantly
large sits next to another actor that looks exactly like him theyre even dressed alike
casting please hold
casting please hold
we pull back to reveal they are sitting beneath an eight foot photograph of urkel wagging his finger at the camera
a slow degree pan around the room reveals ten other actors identical to large aggressively rehearsing their lines to themselves
the actor seated next to large leans over to him
large looks at him
im not a whore you say
and to that i say if you would do this
that you would do this
youre a whore
but it pays the bills you say startin to get a little pissed
and to that i say how do whores how do you think a hooker justifies what she does to her non hooker friends

codey an extreme special ope hacker with an edge

an overweight casting assistant enters
yeah hey sandy
under his breath fuck
come on in
to the room hey guys were only doing the first scene okay the ill cut you
good talking with you bro
we hold on large as he swings his gaze to the actor on his other side aggressively running his lines to the air
hazy and claustrophobic in stopped traffic on the freeway
large stares absently out the window as blaring sirens
compete with the obnoxious ramblings of l
talk large suddenly squints his eyes and clutches his neck in pain
large pulls his car into a parking spot throws the club on his steering wheel and heads towards the back door of the restaurant
but something catches his eye on the side of his car
the camera pulls back to reveal a gasoline pump nozzle sitting in his gas tank with a foot of tattered hose ripped off at the end
he stares at it trying to remember the last time he bought gas
he looks both ways and covertly pulls the nozzle from his tank
he walks towards the back door of the restaurant and throws the nozzle in an open dumpater
large flings open the door and enters a long dark corridor lined with stacked chairs
he passes a waiter in a black tunic wearing eye make up to make him look asian
youve got thirty four and twenty five seated and taylor booked a pilot so he quit
you picked a bad night to be late
large glides through the chaotic environment unfazed by any of the stress
he rounds a corner to a time card machine and swipes his card
the machine beeps and displays the word late in red
he crosses to a locker and quickly changes into a black tunic and pants
he moves through the kitchen which is whirling with over thirty people in white chopping frying sauteing yelling
the vietnamese chef wears a headset and barks orders down the line
large is met by a french woman manager
she walks with him as he weaves his way through the kitchen
ten resumes just today
they come in everyday from idaho or florida or milwaukee and do you know what they want even more than a guest spot on everybody loves raymond
they want your job
this will not happen again
this will never happen again
you have two tables
you are thirty minutes late if i ever say this again your job will she pulls off the top resume from the bunch shes grasping revealing a headshot on the
todd slauson from duluth minnesota
during all this large remains calm and unphased
he takes a stick of eye make up from the pocket of the tunic and paints his eyes to appear asian
as do all the white good looking male waiters
he takes a small radio transceiver device from the pocket of the tunic and turns it on
he unwinds the ear piece pulls it through the back of his jacket out the neck and into his ear
immediately we hear a vietnamese mans voice giving orders over the ear piece
accented but monotone waiter number fifteen your table number twenty three is ready
large takes a deep breath and pushes open the door into a very fancy hollywood vietnamese restaurant filled to capacity with a friday evening crowd
the energy is completely different from the other side of the door
soft asian music plays the room is very dim and lit by candlelight
waiter ten you forgot the order of forty one for table one o one
all waiters eighty six tuna special
large remains dead pan as he crosses to a table with six young hot hollywood types
what the fuck man

waiter number twelve flight number with non stop service to newark international will be departing from gate d
on larges face close as he closes his eyes and we the blare of a jet liner taring off dissolves into the rush of water as large washes his hands
at the last oink in a very long row
he grabs his neck while squinting his eyes closed in pain for a brief second
a moment later he picks up his bag and heads down the line of sinks
as he passes each sink he unknowingly activates their motion sensors and each faucet shoots a tiny burst of water
the nasally voice of a woman singing an off key version of once twice three times a lady with synthesizer accompaniment
a large group of people are gathered around a steel coffin
atop the coffin site a framed picture of a tired looking woman in a wheelchair
this is sarah largeman
we find sylvia largeman the source of the music
close on her face as the assorted palette of colored make up on her cheeks swirls together with tears until it collects on the tip of her chin and drips
like a leaky faucet onto her lyrics sheet as a rainbow of tears splatter the words once and twice
the song finishes and the rabbi begins a series of hebrew prayers
large squints through the mourners to see his father gideon largeman shovel a handful of dirt onto the casket
behind him stands cynthia dillard a beautiful young black woman
his focus racks to reveal two young men seated on a rusty tractor smoking cigarettes about thirty yards behind the ceremony
we jump cut to after the ceremony as large weaves through the crowd and approaches the two men
we see now they are ha rks good looking in a dirty way
they are quite filthy but each sports expensive jewelry and black yarmulkes
they look up as large approaches
largeman what the hell are you doin here

large heads back to his car
the crowd has dispersed
tight on an enormous portrait photograph that fills a wall in it large as a young boy sarah not yet in a wheelchair and gideon largeman huddle together with a
black woman and her young daughter cynthia against a white background
they all wear white t shirts blue jeans and no socks
everyone but sarah smiles widely into the lens
shiva is in full swing as forty or so older suburban jewish new jerseyites of every shape and size mingle over small food and small talk
the camera moves past several a heavy woman with gobs of make up and lots of gold
well you had to call her she never called anyone
a woman in a white tennis outfit talking to a group
this was a woman who never smiled
an older man in glasses with cream cheese all over his lips
somebody ate all the lox
the camera moves to two very jewish older ladies simultaneously telling the same story to a group of friends
the new thing is talk to the hand

large site on a couch in the den next to his aunt sylvia the singer from the funeral
some young children play on the rug in front of them
large stares off into space as she pets one of the childrens heads and looks to large for conversation
did you know your mother redid the hallway bathroom
large looks over realizing shes talking to him

large flips the light on to reveal the entire bathroom is done in the same floral pattern everything wallpaper towels curtains
he looks down at the shirt its the same pattern
he slides his sweater off to reveal his pale thin chest
he stares at himself in the mirror for a moment
he tilts his head to the right and stares at his body
he pulls the shirt on and buttons up the front
as he does his entire chest and person disappear into the design of the room
he looks at himself in the mirror it looks like his head and forearms are floating in mid air
large almost smiles as he makes his forearms dance around in mid air
gideon largenan sits alone at his desk

they nod at each other
large walks out
a tattered vintage american flag site framed above the bed
large eases past all the shelves trinkets nothing seems to mean anything and then several people are seated amongst dozens of presents laughing
seven year old large stands with his arm around a seven year old cynthia
they both wear enormous chicken foot slippers and smile from ear to ear
larges pov zooms into the face of the only person in the photo not smiling
this is sarah largeman
she stands not yet requiring a wheelchair
he crosses to the bed and sits down
the surface sends waves towards the pillows throwing them off the bed revealing its a loud ring from a phone on the bedside table which appears to be made out
he answers it
large pulls away a tarp to reveal a classic world war ii army motorcycle with a sidecar
the corner of hie mouth raises and holds the idea of a smile
large flies through the suburban sprawl without a helmet
the the wind throws his hair back as large whips through the back roads
hes going really fast
he closes his eyes flying by a cop car doing eighty before he opens them again
lights flash behind him as he pulls over
the cop car stops behind him and blares him with the search light

all we can see is a silhouette of a figure standing amidst the blaring lights and swirling blue and red colors

the crowd quickly moves onto other things
in a whisper you like that

mark points to a photo of an awkward looking young man

a teenage couple drunkenly makes out on the bed

a group of people sit around the couch drinking beer

this guy has one idea and hes a trillionaire
i got a thousand ideas but i gotta sit around and wait for all my relatives to die
they join the group
mark blows coke off a large golf book
dave has a young girl on his lap
large begins to notice that the girls in the room although quite attractive are pretty young
as he pans the room he lock eyes with a beautiful young girl
they play chicken briefly to see who will break the stare first
large does and looks to his right where someone has just passed him a joint he hits it and passes it on
he passes large the golf book
oh no thanks man
but youre like a movie star and shit
no no thanks
well then here
jesse opens his palm to reveal a tiny hit of e with a smiley face on it
large takes it in his hand and thinks about it
he looks around at everyone else in the room eating them including the cute girls
i guess ill see youguyslater
he eats the hit
should we play a game
other than golf
no lets play spin the bottle
the idea is met with mixed reaction from the group
im not playing spin the bottle how old are we
or more importantly how old are they
jesse passes large the joint
theyre all legal
he smiles a toothy grin
kelly a young hot girl with a raspy voice takes control
well we just ate all this fuckin ex what the hell else are we gonna do
the girl has a point
okay how bout this
he holds up a bottle of tequila with a ribbon around
first lets finish daddys golf tequila
then we can use this bottle
the group loves this idea as they laugh and party the caia
era finds its way to larges face as he feels the weed and the beginning of his trip
his eyes and face navigate the ha mnv start
the party seems to fast forward around large the music fades to one low note until it breaks with people calling his name
he snaps his attention to the game
the bottle is pointed directly at him
largeman this is dana
large looks over to the sexy young girl whom he locked eyes with before
she smiles at him
awkwardness fills the room
snapping out of it oh whos up
they all laugh
she gets up and slowly walks over to the couch
she smiles nervously
large stares at her
we see in his eyes hes feeling more fucked up every instant
she stands above him at the couch then straddles him with her knees on either side of his legs sitting on his lap
the music plays
everyone is speechless
she slowly leans in
they kiss softly enjoying every second
its incredibly sexy
they stop and look at each other
she kisses him on the cheek and gets up
everyone reacts and some clap
this is gonna be a good night
everything speeds up and slows down
a barrage of images people hooking up girls kissing girls guys feeling girls up joints being passed one girl crying mark showing off his golf swing large trying to take
deep breaths jesse and dave hugging two figures moving quickly under a blanket
kenny in full riot gear letting people take turns hitting him in his helmet
faster hands gripping each other a nose on a neck hands gripping a waist
ecu s largos face as his eyes swim in their eocketo s end the corners of his mouth lift with the idea of a smile
the motion of the room is sped to a blur until finally a blaring light comes out of the darkness
morning sun streams through a window revealing larges face full frame eyes still closed
across his forehead in thick black marker the word balls is written
his eyes open wide
he has no idea where he is
his eyeballs swing left then right
as large site up the camera pulls back to reveal we are large site on the sofa covered in an afghan
white morning sunlight pries past the beach towels covering the windows to highlight the duet in the air
a noise in the kitchen pops large s eyes open
he has no idea where he is
larges pov into the kitchen reveals limited glimpses of a person walking around like a hunters amateur video of his bigfoot sighting
he can only make out pieces a sword boots then a cereal box
then quickly the figure turns into perfect view a medieval knight in full regalia
they make eye contact for a second and large slams his eyes shut
when he opens them again the knight is gone
large and mark sit with carol marks mother and tin payton
carol is mid forties and always looks like shes got a cold or has just been crying
tim is dressed as a medieval knight
large and mark stare at tim as he slurps down his cereal
carol smokes a thin cigarette
mark is shirtless
no one addresses the fact that it says balls in black marker on larges forehead
silence but for the clanking of silverware and tims its good isnt it
no one responds so tim nods to be nice
i always try to save a couple of marshmallows for the very end but i can never make it
my mind wanders and im left with flakes and pink milk
and yet each time i pour a bowl i tell myself that this time this is gonna be the time im gonna save at least one
so tim how long you been working at medieval times
but ive only been a knight for two
you have to pay your dues
i worked in the stables and helped in the kitchen

you must have gotten it confused with pleej artulyah

large stares at mark in disbelief then starts to laugh
they all start to join him except mark
they stop laughing
mark hes a knight
hes just a fast food knight
i should get going anyway
he gets up to leave
but his sword gets caught between his chair and the table
they all watch as he fumbles to undo himself
hes like john ritter at his finest
large and mark just laugh
thanks for the cereal
by the way it says balls on your face
carol follows tim out
large slides to the microwave doors reflection
my mom did it
mark and large sit captivated by alligators eating zebras on tv
larges forehead is now merely smeared with black ink
mark leans forward to pull a bong hit from a blackened colored tube
he coughs out his hit and reclines his bare back against the torn pleather couch
carol enters and stands next to them watching the tv
she finds a long thin cigarette with lipstick on it in the ashtray and lights it
what the fuck is that shit mom
gimme a hit of that
dont bring those fucking people here anymore mom
or im leaving

he passes the bong to his mom

okay bye large good to see you

she gets to the door then crosses back to mark

she slams the front door
she drives me crazy
shes gets all fried out and makes me feel like i gotta impress her all the fucking time

large site forward abruptly
oh not what time is it
large rushes in to the counter
a female hispanic receptionist looks up
hi im andrew bargeman

she looks at her watch
im going to need you to fill out this paperwork for me and well call you when were ready for you
he site back down and begins filling out the form the door opens and a blind woman with a seeing eye dog enters
the receptionist sees her and calls out hi mrs
oh hello there

large turns back to his paperwork
he fills out a line before he notices the seeing eye dog has wandered over to him
large looks at him
cold disinterested hi how are you
the dog looks both ways before mounting larges leg and proceeds to thrust his groin to and fro
large tries to shove him off
he looks back at the blind woman who stares off in the other direction
large is about to say something to her but he stops himself
under his breath get off
the dog thrusts away
finally large gives up and decides to just let it hump away he tries to return to his paperwork
someone bursts out laughing
large turns to see a cute year old girl he hadnt seen sitting in the corner
she wears really big headphones

the girl and large look to each other the receptionist is gone

the dog humps away
the girl comes over and sits one seat away from large

they sit and watch him go
oh hes gonna be sore tomorrow
wide side angle on the whole waiting room
everything still but the dogs thrusting pelvis

arthur immediately responds to her voice and returns to her side to lead her into the office

jake ryan winters
i doubt youd know him
he was on sheena once as some gnome or something
i think thats great though
oh that last scene where you make that speech to the whole stadium and your dad gives you the thumbs up that was it was emotional
i mean i didnt cry but i think my dad did
i couldnt totally see but he got up to go to the bathroom and i think i heard him sniffle
couldve been dander
so are you doing anything else
not right now im just
any other retarded roles
im sure you could definitely get more of those
no im just auditioning and
i cant believe youre not really retarded
jakes not a very good actor
i mean on sheens you couldnt really tell cause he was in a hairy gnome suit but he used to put on these really low budge renditions of andrew lloyd
webber musicals in our attic when we were kids and they were awful
it sucks cause there isnt a whole lotta work for little people you know
anyway sorry i talk too much fill out your forms
large just stares at her
what are you listening to
you know them
oh are you kidding me
you gotta here this one song itll change your life i promise you
oh but you have to fill out your forms
well do it while you listen to she hands him her hugs earphones
the shins flew slang is playing
he looks at sam and she just stares at him and nods smiling
after a moment he takes the phones off and hands them back to her
the song continues softly from the headphones
i like it
so what are you doing here
what are you doing here
waiting for a friend
fuck that was nosey im sorry
i didnt mean to be nosey
that was so nosey
its al ight
i uh get headaches
so i just wanna have that checked out
were ready for you
he turns to sam
it was nice meeting you
good luck with your head
dont worry sam well get to you next
large turns to sam
she looks away
large site alone in a barren office
he pans around the room staring at all the diplomas
his eyes follow them up from the base board all the way up to the ceiling to reveal theres actually one on the ceiling
the doctor enters
theres absolutely nothing wrong with you
im just kidding how would i know that
they shape hands
im doctor cohen
what can we do for you today andrew
ive been having these really intense headaches
they only last for a split second and then theyre gone
its like a lightning flash almost like a surge of electricity and then its gone
he looks at the chart
youre gideons kid
i didnt even put the two together
im sorry about youre mother
i must have missed you at shiva last night
so how long have these headaches been going on
well i think ive had them in some form since i was a little kid
but theyve been getting more and more frequent over the last year
looking at chart how long have you been on the lithium
oh uh ive been on some form of it since i was ten or so
and what about paxil zoloft celexa depakote did any of that ever help you
i mean i dont know
its recently occurred to me that i might not even have a problem
only id never know it because as far back as i can remember ive been medicated
i grew up on it
i left them in la
this is the first time i havent had it in my body since i can remember
well itll leave your body pretty fast
ill write you a prescription
was thinking about taking a little vacation
have you spoken to your psychiatrist about that
e h well my psychiatrist is my dad
i think hed prefer me to stay on it
he likes to think it makes me happy
and i let him think that because hes sort of consumed by the idea of making everyone happy
well look ill examine you and give you a catscan just so you wont worry that its anything serious
but to be honest i think the headaches are something else
our bodies do very funny things when theyre consumed with stress and anxiety
things youd never expect
i found my ex best friends cuff links in my wifes puree and i couldnt get an erection for a year and a half
but that doesnt really feel like it
i mean i dont feel stressed or really anxious at all
well with all the lithium hes had you on its amazing you can even hear me right now oh right
first of all i do think you need to find a psychiatrist that isnt your father
that justs something that should have been remedied years ago
he knows better
secondly im not in a position to comment on whether or not you should stay on the meds or not i dont know your story
but my opinion since youre paying for it is that those drugs may help as a means to an end
but if youre not in any sort of therapy sooner or later whats ever going on in your mind will find a way to peek its little head out of
just something to think about
beat but for now lets have a look at you
an overhead shot of large staring at the wall as he lies on a white slab covered from the waist down by a white towel
an old female nurse straps him to the slab ignoring the obscene words and drawings in black marker that cover his chest
the camera cranes down to reveal large and the slab being sucked
into the catscan tunnel
large drives out of the parking lot
there seated at the bus stop is sam bobbing her head to music she wears a backpack and holds an odd looking helmet in her hand
he pulls up alongside her
why were you really there
im a robot
do you lie a lot
what do you consider a lot
enough for people to call you a liar
people call me lots of things
is one of them liar
i could say no but how will you know im not lying
because i ll choose to trust you
you can do that
i can try
whos bike is this
it was my grandfathers
it was the only thing he left to anyone in my family and he left it to me
and i like it
this is the point where you ask me if id like a ride home
would you like a ride home
fine but i m not getting in that sidecar why not
sidecars are for bitches
anyone who gets in that thing is automatically your bitch
thus i will ride on the back
she climbs on the back behind him
re the helmet what are you like
they drive off
i thought my boyfriend was gonna pick me up on his bike so i brought it
but then he couldnt so
so what its like one of those tandem things
no its a ninja
way faster than this thing
but what kind of helmet is that
you can use it on a motorcycle
anyway hows your head
i should live through the day
make a right here
they stop at a light
are you doing anything right now
can you elaborate on doing anything
well i just had this idea
i promised this guy id stop by his house thats right up here but i dont really wanna stay very long
so i was just thinking if you came with me i could say i have to take you home when im ready to go
well thats pretty damn random of ya andrew
nice to meet you
may i use you
thats the hollywood in ya i guess
no its not like that cmon
itll be fun
ill tell you what
well have like a signal
when you pull on your ear thats the code and then ill say well ive got to get her home now
and then well go
she mulls it over
can we have code names too
if youd like
but dont try and like kidnap me or anything because my step uncles a bounty hunter and i could have you tracked and killed
the light changes and they drive off
the poorly maintained backyard of a mansion pools fountains
jesse stands shirtless and unshaven holding an enormous bow and arrow aimed at the sky
the end of the arrow is on fire
a joint hangs from his lips
sam and large look terrified
he unleashes the arrow into the air and the three of them scramble around in terror trying to avoid wherever it will land
it plunges into the earth three feet from sams foot
frozen she yanks on her ear hard
sam and large stand on the front porch of her working class house
ill be fine
am i the first boy youve ever brought home
but i lied about my boyfriend driving a t
he doesnt drive a bike
no i dont have a boyfriend
he might drive a bike wherever he is
well were off to a great start
okay so sometimes i lie
im weird man
about random stuff too and i dont even know why i do it
its like a tick
i swear sometimes i hear myself say something and then i think wow thats not even remotely true
so how am i supposed to know whats real
well i always feel bad and admit them when theyre lies
can you trust that
open the door
she pushes the front door open and immediately three enormous doberman pinchers bark and climb all over large
kick their balls
kick their balls
sam tries slapping them on their backs
olivia sams mother comes rushing in clutching a hamster with a bloody nose
everybody downl who wants to eat
do you want to eat
well then get the fuck off him
she smacks their asses and they eventually retreat to the other room
im so sorry we just dont have the time to train em
who has time to trainem
when they were puppies it was cute but now its like having a herd of clydesdales
its just too much
kevins the baby he really just follows the others but last week anthrax and steven killed a dove and left him on the front porch
or maybe it was a pigeon he was grey
member that samantha
mom this is
the place is a wreck im so sorry
you look very familiar
hes the retarded quarterback
oh my god
you are the retarded quarterback
you were so good on that show
now im really ashamed
look at this place
and im wearing sweat pants
to sam through her teeth while nodding at is he really retarded
oh tell me whats that alan thicke like
ive heard hes a cocky son of a bitch
no hes a really nice guy
well welcome welcome
samantha i told you to take the wheel out of the hamster cage
she holds up a dead hamster
i forgot mom
well you forgot and now jellys dead
luckily i got peanut butter out in time
we have to get the only hamster on planet earth that cant figure out a stupid hamster wheel
now the rest of am cant even get a good sweat going
theres a shoe box on the kitchen counter
you can do the honors
i have to run to work
she sighs and absentmindedly pate her forehead with the hamster
it was so nice to meet you
samantha put the clothes in the dryer and bury jelly
she kisses sam on the cheek and then shes gone
they stand there a moment to catch their breath
then they both start laughing
come on in
they walk into the living room
big couches with tattered afghans on them
a christmas tree with the lights on in the far corner a few unwrapped presents underneath
an enormous hamster labyrinth a fish tank three cats a bird cage
so this is it
no its not
you dont have to say that just cause you cant think of anything else to say
its really nice
its very cozy
you guys are a little early on the tree huh
yeah well we never got around to taking it down so when it got to be fall again we just figured we might as well leave it
are you freaked out
youre totally freaked out arent you
no not at all
i like it
wanna see my room
they cross to the staircase and are met by titembay ti tem bay a handsome young black man in a sweater carrying books
titembay this is my friend andrew
andrew this is my brother titembay
hi nice to meet you
nice to meet you
im sorry about jelly
oh its okay
i saved some mac and cheese for you
its in the f ridge
anyway im late for class it was nice meeting you
yeah you too
they walk up the stairs
we watch the locks turn as sam uses a key from the outside
music posters everywhere
this is it
she puts on a cd the song im doing fine by colin hay
nothing fancy but
its titembay right
yeah its weird huh
youre so freaked out right now youre like running for the door
you can go dont feel bad
stop doing that
that whole thing you just did
dont do that
i want to be here and i wouldnt be here if i didnt want to be okay
trust me my familys way more fucked up then yours okay
yeah hes my brother
is he adopted
well kind of
my mom adopted him years ago from sally strothers
one of those for the cost of a cup of coffee a day kind of things
where shes like how can you sit there and not help the children
and we just couldnt
we couldnt sit there and not help those children
so we sent him letters and pictures for years and then i got really into ice skating and we kind of forgot aboutem
then one day the phone rang and it was titembay and he was at the dry cleaners around the corner and he said that he was going to school at
rutgers and living in the dorms but since he was used to living with his tribe hed much rather live with his family
yeah and hes been here ever since
hes an amazing guy you gotta hear some of his stories
i mean this guy struggled through so much because he wanted to learn
i think of what hes accomplished and i just feel so lazy
hes studying criminal justice at rutgers right now and when he was a baby he was one of those kids with flies all over his face
i mean thats great
its a crazy story
that my friend is a true story
im not that good a pause
sam sits on the bed
the awesoke music plays
she breaks the moment by pulling a small tattered piece of satin fabric off the bed
this is tickle
large sits down next to her
what is tickle
tickle is my favorite thing in the whole world
its all thats left of nannie
and tickle is all that remains
was there a hurricane or something
no i mean i had it since i was born
it was the blanket they brought me home in from the hospital
its like the wailing wall
the wailing wall
its like the most holy place for jews to go and pray in israel
its all thats left of this enormous temple that was destroyed by the romans
wow so youre like really jewish
yeah you are arent you
no im not
i mean im jewish but im not really jewish
i dont do anything jewish
i dont go to temple or anything
but i dont know any jews who go to temple
the jews i know only go on yom kippur
one day the day of repentance
did you know that most temples are designed with movable walls so that on the one day of the year when a everyone comes to repent they can actually make
the room big enough to hold everyone
i dont really believe in god
oh i believe in tickle they laugh
a nice moment
they hold eye contact
the awesome were not gonna like make out or anything
im sorry i just totally ruined the moment didnt i
no i wasnt
i just mean were not gonna like make out
i hadnt planned on
i didnt mean to put that out there that was lame
that was so dumb
you know what i do when im feeling completely unoriginal
she stands up and does really weird gestures with her hands
i make a noise or i do something that no one has ever done
and then i feel like
unique again even if only for a second
so no one has ever done that
not in this spot no
you just witnessed a completely original moment in history
you try one
trust me yours was good enough for both of us
what are you shy
this is your chance to do something that has never ever been done before and will never be copied throughout human existence
if nothing else youll be remembered as the only person who ever did this
he stares at her
shes not gonna let up
large lifts his index finger in the air and twirlsa it
be stares at her
how was that
oh ive done that one before
she bursts out laughing
sam cont t so i got to bury this hamster before the dogs eat him
you warms help
rusty leaves fall on a backyard swallowed mostly by an empty above ground swimming pool
sam carries the shoe box as they walk around behind the pool to reveal about a dozen large rocks serve as tombstones for different pets
i mean this is
they stand in silence
its not that were bad pet owners or anything its just that weve had so many of them over the years
besides some of these are fish
not to say fish deserve less than other animals but moat people just flush them and we just dont believe in that
i mean the idea of flushing something that had life in it
it just makes me sad you know
you gotta honor something a little more than that like congratulations man you had life
heres your trophy a little spot in the ground to hang out in
anyway im gonna put jelly right here next to goliath the rotweiler titembay backed over during his driving exam
she kneels down and begins to dig with a small shovel left nearby
large sits down next to her and watches her dig
a brisk wind makes him hug his knees in for warmth
what are you thinking about
a second ago before i asked
right now i was thinking
i was thinking that ive been going to a lot of these things lately
no not dates
this isnt a date
is this a date
who else died
thats why im home actually
yeah i uh
i havent even really told you that yet but uh
yeah my mom just died
sam stops digging and stares at him
god its weird to say that out loud my mom died
eo thats why im home
im so sorry
oh god im so sorry
and here i am putting you through another one
i mean not that jellys even comes close to your moms
although we loved jelly but still
im so sorry
i didnt know
no its okay
its okay actually
im all right with it
anyway i think its what she wanted so
how did she die
large thinks about that
im sorry im so nosey
forget i asked im sorry
i just need to shut up sometimes
no its okay
she drowned actually
sams jaw drops
my mom was a paraplegic she had uh
she was in a wheelchair
she was uh
taking a bath and then i guess she slipped or something
thats what they say
i dont know
but needless to say she drowned
thats how she died
sam is speechless
tears well in her eyes
this was uh
oh my god
tears roll down her face
with a laugh why are you crying
i dont know im sorry im not usually like this
its just so sad
its so tragic
its like real life tragedy or something
look lets change the subject okay
lets really bring the focus back to jelly
i mean what could be ruder than talking about someone else who died while youre in the act of burying a close friend
sam places the box in the hole shes dug
what should we do
well iive only been to one of these things re the other graves you appear to be the expert
we usually say something
okay well ill go first
i didnt really know you jelly
but from what i hear you were a good pet
had a little trouble with the wheel
its not funny
jelly you were a great pet
tears roll down her face
im so so sorry i forgot to take the wheel out of the cage
im so sorry about that
i hope that you liked me
tears stream down her face as she shovels dirt onto the tiny shoe box
the patter of the soil hitting the box is the only sound we hear as the camera cranes up above them to a birds eye perspective settling on a final
frame that looks down on the whole backyard the above ground pool the pet cemetery and in the bottom right corner sam burying as large watches
once again shiva is in full swing
large passes through a doorway and begins to hear a computerized seeping to the tune of the shmaa
a jewish prayer
he looks to his left to see an electronic mazooza on the door frame
it says the sharper image on the bottom
he moves his head back and forth past its censor and each time it begins the beeping of the shma anew
a tired looking man in his s eating a cookie
avi wants his bar mitzvah theme to be musicals
as in broadway musicals
can you believe that
pauls kids theme was the meta i got to do the elora with mookie wilson
miriam and i were at one last weekend at the pierre whole thing was like a winter wonderland
live penguins wearing yalmulkas
now me i got to lay out ten grand alone for some asshole to build a barricade of french garbage across the boccie lanes at my tennis club
the camera picks up large holding a plate of food as he approaches cynthia
she sits alone with a big photo album on her lap
i was just thinking i was just thinking you spend youre whole life lusting for anything you dont have
you stress over money and your career you set your clocks back you exercise you wait in line you paint your house get depressed feel better buy things take your
clothes to the dry cleaner set your clocks forward and spend your whole life waiting for happiness to arrive in the mail
then you die and people are really sad they cry really hard
and then they go eat lunch
hetakes a bite of his bagel
oh please be a little more interesting than that
please dont be the brooding guy
thats so unoriginal
id rather hold onto who i imagined youd become
she didnt like being alive
she got what she wanted
this should be a party
instead were supposed to mope
she never did anything
she made you
i do have to say im impressed with the turnout
what you didnt think people would come
seems to me the only thing more depressing than a funeral is a funeral where no one shows up
dont you ever think about wholl show up to yours
right now im alive so i think about living
its one way to determine who your friends are
the people whod show up at my funeral if it was held in their state thats one level of friend
but my real friends the people who really love me theyd come if it was on the other side of the country
so where do i fall into that
youd be there
oh you think so
i think youd show up because the truth is that you really did miss met you always thought of me as the brother you never had
but youve got too much pride to let me know that
you want to pout cause i dont return your calls
youre way more talkative than i remember
today ive been more talkative than i remember
what about mine
i probably wouldnt travel for it no
but dont worry im sure youll have a great turnout
why do you say that
cause theres also the guy who lives his life to insure a good turnout
i think thats how my dad lives his like hes sort of writing his own eulogy as he goes and making life choices dependent on how it will sound in
are you implying that thats why im going to med school or something
im just saying a lot of people not necessarily you a lot of people try and accumulate accolades that will somehow justify their lives
its said we spend ninety five percent of our lives trying to look good
where do i sign up for not caring
how about sucking it up and really having it out with your dad
that would be a tremendous step towards not needing to look good
wow that was so clever how you did that
is he grooming you to be a psychiatrist too
med schools one thing but please dont become him
hes one of the most caring people ive ever met
well you would say that youre the son and daughter he never had
hell youre the family he never had
has he got you on lithium yet
wait till he does youll love him even more
i bet my mom a dollar you were coming home with a message
i said after nine years hes definitely coming home with a message
i looked for a message i got bored and became an actor
large enters the kitchen where janice s cynthias mom is doing the dishes
he walks over to the counter near the sink and just stares off across the room
she dries her hands and moves to large
she opens her arms
after a beat he steps into her embrace
he rests his head on her shoulder and closes his eyes
neither says a word
morning sun blasts the entire room
large site on the edge of his bed squinting at pictures large peeks his head around the doorway
after shutting the door behind himself he crosses to the dresser and lifts one perfume bottle out from a dozen
he smells the nozzle then brings the bottle with him as he edges towards
the bathroom is stark white
a large jacuzzi tub sits at the far end of the room
the faucet drips
as it wells with water and overflows to drip onto the drain
large crosses to the tub and tries to tighten the faucet to stop it from dripping
it continues to drip
he stares at the empty tub
large jumps around and puts his hand to his chest
holy shit you scared the shit out of me
he covertly slips the perfume bottle into his pocket
just wake up
sleep all right
i havent even really been in here for a while
ive been using the one in the hall
shower pressures awful in there though
its by no means as good a bathroom as this one is
this one is well we redid all this
beat catching himself this is hard
the faucet drips
they avoid eye contact
janice will make you some lunch
well i guess its breakfast for you
what time is it
drip look i wanted to ask you
i mean if you dont want to talk about this its perfectly fine but im just
no i can
i figured you would want to
but we dont have to do it now
i mean you dont have to do that now
its just at some point i would
i have some questions
i knew that you would
occasionally she would hum
always the same tune and i never knew what the song was
i dont even know if it was a song or if she just made it up its funny because it always struck me as so out of character for her
and every time she did it
i just always liked it
but i never told her i could hear her because i knew if i ever did she would stop
she took a bath every night
and she was always very quiet
the only thing i would ever hear when im in the bedroom was a little splashing of water when she was moving around
and every now and then her humming
so anyway then usually she would call me when she was done so i could come and help her out
but this time that night
she never called
and i just figured she was taking a longer bath or something but when i called out to her she didnt answer
so then i uh
when i came in she was there
so she didnt yell or
i didnt hear anything
the tv was on pretty loud
i always watch the weather report before i go to sleep
its just weird
i dont know its just that youd think if someone was really drowning to death they would scream
i mean really scream from the terror of it all you know
they would splash and scream i would think i would have thought
i would have too but no
off larges look what
dont take this the wrong way
im not reading into this im just thinking out loud so dont get what
its not that
im just saying did they check
i mean has someone ruled that out
because they know she drowned andrew
im just saying the facts
and i suppose it doesnt even really matter
but id be curious to know
i would like to know if thats what happened just for me
i mean would that surprise you
she made it very clear to everyone she knew that nothing was ever going to make her happy i know
do you think i dont know
and cmon lets be honest she tried it before
lust shut your fucking mouth
large is taken aback
if nothing else will you please just leave her alone
thats all you get
we will never see her again
she tried very hard but she just couldnt find it
she could never find it
and i think i know that shes found it now
i know that
and i know theres a certain amount of guilt that you must feel for the way things unfolded but its too late now
so im asking you for me not to do that
come here and do that
i think i deserve to know the truth
you want to make her crazy
does that make it easier for you
tears stream down gideons face he sits down on the toilet and cries
its like you want to torture yourself or something
why would you want to think that
that that happened
why would you ever want to think that
large moves closer to his father who sobs with his head in his lap and his arms over his head
it takes everything large has to reach out his hand and almost touch his fathers shoulder but he doesnt make it and his hand lands on the sink next to
i just want everyone to be happy again
i dreamt last night that i had special powers
if i squeezed my eyes shut and clinched my fiats closed tight enough wed all wake up in paradise
with a laugh through i was like a superhero
and that was my power
a giant rusted yellow tractor sits parked by an open grave large and jesse lean against opposite tombstones facing each other
mark stands in the open grave stealing valuables from an open coffin
a small pile of jewelry sits beside the grave
how could you leave all that lithium
i was totally gonna hit you up for some
this fuckin guy
im glad youre back man because this town is so messed up
everyones got there drug of choice like in brave new world
did you ever read that book
who wrote that
aldous i dont know
jesse continues talking but his voice distorts into warbled slow motion large stares in shock as mark drops a wedding ring into the pile of jewelry hes stealing off the
eye contact for an uncomfortable moment
large breaks it and looks away
and people are just like that here man
huxtable aldous huxtable
sam and large are looking through a photo album
olivia enters with an enormous parrot on her shoulder
andrew would you like to see sams ice skating tape
she was so ahead of her time
she could have gone to the olympics
no i couldnt have
yes you could have
dont blame it on the epilepsy you had a gift
large looks to sam but she avoids eye contact with him cmon let me see it
lets just show him the florida stars of the ice opening the gator costume
im asking you seriously
dont be shy
just let me see it
oh she wants you to see it
how could you not want him to see how talented you are
they cross to the tv room where they find titembay wearing rubber gloves seated next to an open tool box dusting the coffee table for fingerprints and referring to an
open text book
white powder reveals fingerprints and pawprints everywhere including the tv screen
honey what are you doing
im dusting for prints
well do you think we could move the crime scene to the kitchen
i want to show andrew sam skating
but someones been pissing on my gamecube and im about to close the case
it wasnt me your honor
the pawprints point to a canine
andrew come sit down here next to me
large sits next to olivia on the couch between snoring dobermans
he places his glass of water on the table
sam stands in the doorway
i cant believe youre showing him this
the shaky amateur video comes up on the screen a person in a full alligator costume wearing white gloves skates onto the ice
the lights come down except for a spotlight on the alligator
there she is
youre the alligator
you can tell by the hands
the alligator skates in and out of the white fingerprints on the tv screen to classical music
we begin to see that sam is a talented skater
in a very odd way its beautiful
here comes the double axle
i mean come on
isnt she good
large titembay and olivia applaud
as they do the lights in the room switch on and off
titembay claps twice to turn them back on
that was so good
youre moms right you were amazing
titembay has begun brushing white powder on larges water glass revealing his fingerprints
okay this was great but we have to go now
all right well i just wanted to show you how talented she is
okay get out of here
wait give me a hug
sam crosses to her mom
i love you so much
im so proud of you
i love you too
olivia kisses sam on her forehead
okay have a good night
she pats sams butt as she walks toward the door
thank you so much for dinner
cmon youre giving me a hug too
ill take a hug
okay good night
calling to titembay night tim
sam and large sit in a booth of a local irish pub drinki ng pints
it was the only thing i ever really liked doing pretending to be someone else
but ive been so out of it the only parts i ever get offered are to play handicapped people
she tries to hold it together but she bursts out laughing
its not funny
dont ya see that its a joke
if you cant laugh at yourself lifes gonna seem a lot longer than youd like
so what should we laugh at you about
i lied again
i have epilepsy
which part are we laughing about
i had a seizure in the law office where i work and they said their insurance would only cover me if i wore preventative covering
the helmet i was carrying
large is silent
oh come on thats funny
im the only person in the world wearing a helmet to work who isnt putting out fires or racing for nascar
but what do you do
i cant quit their insurance is amazing
what can you do
im not saying i dont cry a lot but in between i laugh and realize how silly taking anything very seriously is
and plus i look forward to a good cry
i just love the way it feels
i havent cried since i was a little kid
i didnt cry at my mothers funeral
i wanted to i
i thought of all the saddest things i could think of things in movies this image from life magazine that haunts me
that actually made me sadder than anything the fact that i felt no numb
what do you mean
mark dave and jesse appear with some others
hey guys this is sam
this is mark dave and you met jesse
nice to meet you
im sorry i yelled vagina just now i didnt see you
lets get fucked up
off larges smile we a palatial swimming pool in the backyard of jesses mans ion
the manhattan skyline twinkles far in the distance
large sam mark dave jesse and a couple of high school girls from the bar stand in their underwear on the edge of the pool
one two three
everyone jumps into the pool screaming except for large
he stands there staring at the water
what are you doing
largeman get the fuck in the pool
oh its so warm
can you swim
course i can swim
jump cut to
large in the shallow end doing the most pathetic doggy paddle youve ever seen
everyone stares in disbelief
dude maybe you should stay on the steps i dont know cpr
you look like a drunken beaver
they all laugh sam swims over to him sitting on the steps
she smiles at him
in a whisper i never learned how to swim
i thought you just had a cramp
in a whisper i cant whistle if it makes you feel any better
theres a handful of normal kid things i kinda missed
theres a handful of normal kid things i kinda wish id missed
she floats on her back beside him
so how long are you gonna stay here
probably till my fingers get wrinkly
with a laugh no i mean in jersey
i think ill probably head home the day after tomorrow
thats not my home
rer smile fades
you know that point in your life when you realize that the home you grew up in isnt really your home anymore
and all of a sudden even though you have a place where you put your shit the idea of home is gone
i still feel at home in my house
youll gee when you move out
it just kind of happens one day and its gone
and you feel like you can never get it back
its like you feel homesick for a place that doesnt even exist
but maybe its like this rite of passage you know
and you wont ever have that feeling again until you create a a new idea of home for yourself for the family you start for your kids
its like this cycle
maybe thats all a family really is a group of people who miss the same imaginary place
they hold eye contact
the splash of a cannonball swings their gaze to the others horsing around in the deep end
sam leans her head over and rests it on his shoulder
an enormous and desolate living room devoid of any furniture or decoration
mark jesse sam and large sit huddled under towels at the foot of a colossal fire place that houses a small blaze
they eat potato chips and drink canned beer
they are all pretty tipsy
mark plays with a silent velcro sample
how bout some fucking furniture dude
i bought a chair but i didnt like it
where is it
its keeping us warm
i got an idea loud tape well make millions
i feel like if i had showed up at school and presented the idea of silent velcro they would have sent me away a whole lot sooner
they all laugh
so why did they send you away
she takes a sip of her beer
whoa listen to this girl
they didnt send me away
youre the one who said they sent you away
i mean they did but
they sent me to boarding school
sent me away implies i went to some asylum or something
there were no straps involved
why did they send you to boarding school
large looks to jesse and mark
they sent me to boarding school because uh
they thought i might be dangerous
oh are you freaked out
youre so freaked out right now
why did they think you might be dangerous
im dangerous and i didnt get to go to boarding school
i was a kid and i was they just
i was a teenager and they were depressed and it just wasnt a good combo
but obviously something happened
i mean there must have been an event
youre like a little detective
you and titembay should go into business together solve mysteries out of a van
am i being too nosey
i just havent ever really talked about it
to be honest i never really knew either
i mean i heard stories
you wanna know
i was the reason she was in a wheelchair
i pushed her
so there that is
no its the truth
it was a complete freak accident
i mean its one of those things that you replay a million times in your head and you see so clearly what a freak thing it was
say whole life she was depressed for no reason
look at this picture
he pulls the picture of he and cynthia as children wearing chicken slippers out of his wallet
look at her face
thats how she
was every single day of her life
and one day
i was nine years old and i just really hated her for that and i pushed her
i mean it was innocent
i was just frustrated cause
you couldnt make her happy
and any other time she would have just yelled at me and sent me to my room but this time in that moment the door of the dishwasher was open
the latch on it was broken and it would just randomly fall open
that fucking latch its funny how so much of my life hasbeendetermined by a quarterinchpiece of plastic
so she fellbackover the door and her neck hitthekitchen counter paralyzing her from the waist down
sams eyes are wide in shock
oh my god
still want to compare fucked up families
but your mom was in the wheelchair long before you left
well i was nine
they sent me to therapy and my father put me on these drugs that were supposed to curb my anger
and ive been on some form of them ever since
my mother who was clinically depressed before the accident sank even lower to the point where she just ignored everyone but our housekeeper janice and her daughter cynthia
and when i was sixteen my psychiatrist dad came around to the conclusion that it might not be the healthiest environment for me to be growing up in
so he sent me to boarding school
and i havent been home since
for her funeral
until now for her funeral
im off to a ripping start in this life huh
next time through i think ill lay low out of the gate
he takes a sip of his beer
the thing is though when i think about it i wasnt really abnormally angry at all
i mean it all happened so quickly i got prescribed all these drugs for anxiety and depression and anger so i just kind of became what they are
it sounds like a punishment
i think it was
so i left them in la
im taking myself off punishment
please dont remind me
all he heard of that whole story was left drugs in la
a year old girl from the pool comes around the corner mark
wheres the sauna
mark and jesse look at each other
they race towards her tripping drunkenly on towels and pushing each other out of the way
sam smiles at large
her face glowswarm from the fire
youre in it right now arent you

a beat of silence
she tries to stifle her smile by pursing her lips as she turns back and looks him in the eyes
shes so cute

large with bedhead in his boxers hunches over into the refrigerator
he pulls out orange juice and closes the door to reveal gideon standing there

a young black woman with enormous gold earrings and long fingernails stands at the register

she clicks her tongue
she begins filling out a form

theyre not sharp enough

she rings it into the register and counts out bills to mark
thirty nine fifty three
i hope we came in handy at handi world

they exit the store and enter the mall
they walk past stacks of lumber
a major loop hole in the handi world return policy permits returns without receipts on items below forty dollars
so how often do you go
i hit every employee once then wait for them to
luckily no one works at handi world for very long
except karl benson

mark stops and looks at large in the eyes
i dont take anybodys money andrew

and the only thing worse than a favor is a favor involving money
the motorcycle pulls up behind two ambulances being cleaned with hoses
large sees cynthia changing the sheets on a stretcher
they climb off
this will only take a second

this is sam
re the stretcher did he live

he backs away and mounts his bike
cynthia turns to the stretcher and quickly uses her thumb to swipe a tear welling in her eye
mark sam and large enter the tacky lobby
mark carries the gym bag
large and sam follow mark down a corridor and into a vending machine room
he opens a door labeled private into a kitchen area
they weave through the kitchen down another hall
they arrive at a locked door
after a beat its opened by an asian teenager with bad acne blasting his walkman
the far wall is entirely covered with a blown up mural of a new jersey drivers license used for making fake ids
the space where the face would go is missing revealing an opening in the wall
they climb through
they squeeze down a long dark corridor filled with graffiti
they come upon a young teen staring through a peep hole in the wall
mark taps him on the shoulder
he turns his head and nods in recognition
when he pulls away from the peep hole the light projects the yes that really happens
as he looks at mark sam and large his forehead is filled with the image of a business man brushing his teeth
mark leans into his ear
down the hall
theres a hooker in room
its crazy down there
i figured id just chill with this
slow motion mark gestures for large and sam to follow him down the hall
the hall is strewn with young men staring into peep holes
as mark sam and large pass them the peeping toms each turn to see who it is
as they turn each one has the image of what theyre watching projected on their face
we hear the echoes of the sounds from the rooms
an old couple slow dancing projected on another teen
regular motion they arrive at the end of the hall where a group of six young guys are glued to the image being projected onto the wall opposite the peep
an old camera lens has been ducked taped to the peep hole causing the image to appear in perfect focus
the projection shows a very hot young hooker getting taken from behind by an older greaseball
her face is no more than three feet from the peep hole
the hookers muffled moaning can be heard from the other side of the wall
everyones eyes are glued to the wall
large notices one kid has duct tape over his mouth while another is sweating profusely
sams jaw is dropped open
im fucking you
im fucking you
large notices another kid lip synching along with the greaseball
mark spots diego a hispanic guy wearing a bell hop uniform and gestures him closer
shes fuckin hot
this is the most exciting day of my life
weve never had anything close to this
ive got that nitrous tank for you so can i get that info
youre gonna have to wait a couple
the hooker moans
whos fuckin you
whos fuckin you
the lip synching kid mouths you are
dude were kind of in a rush
you can wait hes about to cunt
im gonna fucking cum
diegogestures told you
cum on my back
the group responds in silent shock
jaws drop diego grabs his hair with his fists
just as they are about to climax we mark diego large sam and others rush out into the outer room
they speak in quiet whispers
that shit was hot
i got to go drop some knowledge on that ho
how do you know shes a hooker
of course shes a fucking hooker
girls that look like her do not fuck guys that look like him unless its for money coke or fame
julia roberts married lyle lovett
who the fuck are you
oh this is sam and large
why are you bringing these people here
hes the guy who needs that thing
look i brought you the tank so can you just tell us where to go now
tank come with balloons

no i dont have balloons
suck it off the tap
and i need it back when youre done the guys holding my thirty nine bucks
who here just saw some titties
they all stare
raise your hand if you just saw some titties
they all raise their hands
so everybody needs to calm the fuck down
were in a hurry
you know where kiernans quarry is
they pull up on the motorcycle
down in newark right
yeah its at the bottom of hillside and rivington
you cant really see it from the street but its there
park your car at the gate and hop the fence
at the bottom of the quarry theres this junkyard run by this guy named albert
lies the one that tracked down the piece youre looking for
ill call him right now and tell him to expect you
what the fuck are we doing
just be patient
dude weve been patient all day but its my last day in town and you havent told me what the fuck were doing
i mean if you told me we were going on a six hour scavenger hunt for blow i would have passed
if i was gonna give you coke wed have gone to the high school football practice and wed a been reeling five hours ago
well i think weve corrupted this innocent girl enough for one afternoon
im not innocent
getting worked up yes you are
and thats what i like about you
and i dont want this fucking guy taking you to the bottom of a quarry in a sketchy ass neighborhood to find some pitbulls raping each other or
crack whores huffing turpentine or whatever it is that you have us wow
thats the most worked up ive ever seen you
he was protecting me
he likes me
dont be cute
youre my knight in shining armor
dont talk about knights in front of mark
its a sore subject
im gonna kill that motherfucker
beat as mark gets it
he comes after him
they play wrestle as sam watches
the three of them reach the top of a small hill to reveal
colossal old cranes and construction trucks loom in the distance like ancient dinosaurs frozen in rust and graffiti
the center of the quarry goes so deep they cant see the bottom
they stand on the edge
rain clouds rapidly drift overhead
this glace is surreal
i never even knew this was here
ive heard about it
they were supposed to build a mall here i think
yeah i remember reading about it in the paper
they were digging one day and they broke through into this like natural phenomenon
its like an underground grand canyon or something
so now theyre in some huge legal battle over whether they can build here or not
can you imagine the guy whos job it is to fight for the right to build his mall on some like geological phenomenon
they love their malls here man
okay lets just find this guy and get outta here
youre not gonna tell us what were getting
its a surprise youll see
mark walks on ahead of them down a path that winds down alongside the abyss
further down the path
sam looks to large
he uses an old mop handle hes found as a walking stick
as they continue along the path it begins to get continually cluttered with rusty junk
an old bedframe a porcelain tub remnants of a jungle gym dirty broken toys
further along down the path amidst the junk they see a thirty foot dilapidated souse boat perched on cement blocks that sits right on the edge of the cliff
its windows glow warm and welcoming
mark stands in front of the boat
this isnt what he expected
rain begins to fall
i guess this is it
knock and barter for dessert storm trading cards
please dont tease me about my hobbies
i dont tease you about being an asshole
they stand in the pouring rain staring at the boat
mark steps up and pounds his fist on the wooden hull
after a moment albert a very gentle looking man in his mid thirties with a newborn baby asleep on his shoulder appears on the deck
he smiles warmly in a whisper mark
are you albert
with a smile yes
come on in out of the rain
sam and large look at each other then follow mark up an a frame ladder that sits next to the hull
they step inside and the door closes behind them
its very cozy and warm
great music plays
a wood burning stove heats the room and throws warm amber light onto a small living room with deep cushy couches
you guys must be freezing
make yourselves warm by the fire
im just gonna go put her down
ill be right out
the three of them huddle by the fire
they speak in quiet whispers
i must say ive been continually impressed today with how each new place you bring us manages to be weirder and weirder
what do you mean this is nice
ah nothing just hanging out in an old boat at the bottom of a quarry in newark
its hardly the bottom dude
did you see that cliff
albert returns with faye an equally gentle and caring looking woman in her early thirties
this is my wife faye
this is mark and sam and large right
diego told me when he called
please have a seat make yourselves comfortable
its really coming down out there huh
yeah it just started pouring all of a sudden
well in a bad storm i like to pretend this old boats my own private ark
unfortunately if this is the apocalypse im not quite sure it still floats
would any of you like some tea
id love some tea
large and mark look at her
faye crosses to a small kitchen
they all sit there politely nodding at each other
what is it that you do here
what is this place
were calling it kiernans fault
and no ones really quite sure what it is because they havent been able to explore it
theyre locked in a legal battle over who has the rights to the land
so one of these days it will either be a national park or a shopping mall
but while their locked in litigation i was hired to make sure no one comes inside
what they dont know is that im a geologist working undercover for the preservation lobby
so at night
i go down
hes documenting it to support their case
so how deep does it go
no one really knows
ive been in the furthest and that was about two miles down
but i like to pretend its infinite
faye brings them tea
its kind of an odd job isnt it
guardian of an infinite abyss
yeah i guess it is
we also trade and deal in antique jewelry
i suppose its pretty odd for you that we live down here like this no
not at all
never crossed my mind
but we think its important
what do you think youll find
i dont know
new frontiers are hard to come by these days
i guess i just like the idea of discovering something
doing something completely unique that no ones ever done before
large looks to sam
but i used to think that was all that mattered
no matter what it was as long as i could put my name on it
like it would somehow justify the fact that i lived that i was here
i did that
i got this plate on my travels
but you know what
thats all ego none of that stuff really matters
if at the end of the day i get to be with her if i get to be with this person right here and the baby we created then thats
all i need
just having felt that
if i die in an hour i know ive lived
faye kisses his forehead
you know my whole life ive had that same anxiety that if i didnt discover something or
save something or
save something from being discovered
that ill have somehow wasted my time here
and that somewhere whatever force created us would resent me for it
well i think that force would rather remind you that breathings all it takes to be a miracle
he takes a deep breath
large sam and mark stare at albert transfixed
hes like a sage
well i suppose you want what you came all the way down here for
yeah that would be great
it took me awhile to track this piece down
but i owe diego huge
he pulls a small paper bag off the counter and hands it to mark
mark looks inside and nods his head
they all stand
well thank you for the tea
okay good luck in the rain
would you like some garbage bags or something
yeah that would be great
they open the door and venture into the down pour in their garbage bag parkas
albert stands with his arm around faye in their warm doorway
as the three of them climb down the ladder and head up the path
large turns back around
yelling over the rain r hey albert l yeah
good luck exploring the infinite with a smile thank you
slow motion mark sam and large in black garbage bag rain parkas head up the incline away from the trailer at half speed
large leads them to an old yellow crane thats rusty arm hangs out over the edge
he climbs up onto its base
regular motion large screams as loud as he can with everything he has like hes emptying himself into the abyss
sam and mark look up at him and climb up alongside large to join hint
the three of them in their black parkas with their hair drenched against their heads scream as loud as they can with everything they have in the pouring rain
freeze frame the three of them smiling
a perfect moment
unfreeze sam locks eyes on large
he stares back at her
he wraps his hands around the back of her head and they kiss in the pouring rain on the edge of something
the rain has stopped as larges motorcycle pulls up in front of marks house
mark gets out of the sidecar
so i dont know if im gonna see you
dont you wanna know whats in the bag
to be honest i dont even care anymore
mark pulls out the bag
it practically falls apart its wet from the rain
he pulls out an antique necklace with a square pendant on it
he puts it in larges wet hand
id be lying to ya if i told ya this was my plan all along
but i got it back
thats got to be worth something right
this whole day was about this
and anyway you didnt want it down there with her
its better for you to have it
large shakes his head hes shocked
mark backs away still wearing his garbage bag parka
hey if you ever need a kato you know where to find me
large sits back down on the bike into sams wet arms
he stares at the pendant in his hand
what is it
its my moms favorite necklace
they sit soaked from the rain in the empty bath tub where sarah largeman drowned cross legged facing each other
large wears the necklace around his neck
he plays with the pendant
extreme close up inside tee pendant its an antique game where you try to get three tiny lead balls to sit in three separate indentations
i dont want to play this game
shes sitting here across from you and you can say anything at all
all the things you never got a chance to say
well i dont want to push you
i just thought it might help
i mean isnt that what you came home for
re stops playing with the necklace and takes a deep breath
if she were sitting here
if my mother were sitting here i would tell her
the faucet drips behind him
i really dont wanna
i would tell her that im sorry
im sorry that she wasnt happy
and im sorry i couldnt make her happy
and you know if i could have had anything i ever wanted to have happen in my life actually ever happen it would have been that she would be happy
a tiny tear wells in his lid and
oh my god large i think i see one
yeah i do
dont move we should save it or something
she finds a clear plastic cup
here dont move im gonna get it
she tries to coerce the tear off his cheek into the cup like a child capturing an inch worm
i guess i could put it in my scrapbook if i had a scrapbook
is that it
i think so
i dont feel any more coming
well if you do let me know and ill grab the cup okay
this was a good idea
its funny this thing reminds me of this really random memory of my mother
its so weird i havent thought about this in so long but this great memory i have where i was a little kid and i was crying for one reason
or another and she was kind of holding me and rocking me back and forth
and i could see the little balls in this thing just rolling back and forth
and there was just snot dripping down my nose
and she just handed me her sleeve and told me to just blow my nose into it
and i remember thinking even as a very little kid wow
this is love
more tears start to well and overflow from his eyes
he tries to stifle them with a laugh
he cradles the pendant
this is love
and it just felt so
good to be there
and i didnt feel safe very often but at that moment
tears are now streaming down his face as well as sams
she holds the plastic cup in her hand
oh large im never gonna be able to get all these
she moves closer wrapping her legs around his waist to hug him close
she kisses his wet cheeks
im never gonna be able to get all these am i
its so funny isnt it
but i think thats the single most amazing moment i remember of my mother
cause she wasnt sad and she wasnt being prodded to be happy she was just there
to be your mom
he node and tightens his lips trying to hold in the faucet that his eyes have become a monumental release
he almost looks like a different person
they stare directly into each others eyes
he turns away its too vulnerable a place for him
look at me
look at me
and we see a vulnerable lonely little boy
in a whisper let go
listen to me
just dont hang onto any of it anymore
youre holding on so tight and you just
you dont have to hang onto any of it anymore
just let it all go
i just dont
just let it all go
he cries with his elbow over his eyes
what do you feel
that always helps me
my mom always says whats the word thats burning in your chest
she touches his chest with her hand
what is it
he looks away
look at me
what is it
in a whisper i would say that its love
its this love that i have
yeah it is
and youve got so much of it in you
god you do
youve got so many years of it in you pleading to come out
this fucking hurts
that is life
if nothing else
pointing to his chest that is life
and sometimes it burns
it might be all there is
look at you
look at you
you look like you just came back to life
he just stares at her
who are you
im your new friend sam
holding up her sleeve
they both laugh a release
i feel like i just get so much thrown at me like theres so much speeding by me in a day that i feel like if i look up from
the sidewalk ill get dizzy and fall down
so its like i just
barrel through and dont look up so ill just never fall you know
and thats really
and you know its so sad to say this but thats really how ive been living my whole life
trying to barrel through
well it sounds like you were due to fall
yeah i was
then with a laugh
beat realizing thats funny
the definitions always confused me but im pretty sure thats irony
he wipes his tears away with his own sleeve
she comes in for a tight embrace
he kisses her gently on her cheek with his eyes closed then rests his head on her shoulder
how do you feel
on larges face as he thinks about that question
when im with you i feel so safe
like im rome
a wide shot of the bathroom as sam and large embrace in the middle of the empty tub and the faucet continuee to drip
larges stereo plays i just dont think ill ever get over you by colin ray large and sam lie naked in each others arms
he lies wide awake resting his cheek on top of here
a series of dissolves of large as he lies awake in different positions staring at the ceiling processing
s am turns to him
he gets up out of bed and puts his clothes on
large stands at the end of the bed staring at gideon lying propped up with a book on his cheat asleep
the evening news is on the tv
he sits up startled
oh hey hey cmon in
he finds his glasses on his chest and lifts the remote to turn off the tv
sorry to wake you
no no its uh
i was just reading
ive been on a pretty crazy little journey these last couple of days
youve been avoiding me
no i just
maybe i have been
im sure you can find plenty of things in your life to be angry about but what i dont understand is why youre so angry at me
all i ever wanted was for everybody to be happy again andrew
thats all i ever wanted
but when were we ever all happy dad
i mean you always say that but when was that
when was this time that you have in your mind that you wish we could all get back to
cause i dont have it in my memory
maybe if i did i could help steer us back there
but we should
you and i need to work on being okay if thats not in the cards for us
well we might have a shot at it if you could just forgive yourself for what you did
what i did
what i did
you know what dad
im gonna forgive myself for what i did right now i was a little boy and somebody made a shitty latch
thats what i think now
and im not gonna
i mean im not gonna take all those drugs anymore
because theyve left me completely numb
i have felt so fucking numb to everything i have experienced in my life
and for that im here to forgive you
gideon site up against the headboard
youve always said you wanted us to have whatever it is we wanted
well maybe what mom wanted more than anything was for it to all be over
and for me what i really want more than anything is for it to be okay with you for me to feel something again even if its pain
going against your doctors recommendation thats a pretty weighty experiment to take on dont you think
with a chuckle this is my life dad
this is it
ive spent twenty six years waiting for something else to start
so no i dont think its too much to take on
because its everything there is
i see now its all there is
perhaps the great tragedy of my life will be that you both deserved more than i knew how to give
we deserved nothing more than you
and you deserved nothing more than us
large puts his hand on the center of his fathers bare chest
you and i are gonna be okay
you know that right
we may not be as happy as you always hoped wed be
but for the first time lets allow ourselves to be whatever it is that we are
and thatll be better
i think thatll be better
large sits next to sam on a staircase between two escalators
what are you doing
i dont want to hurt you
how can you
how could you
whats going on
we can figure out the long distance thing
this is a good thing large
youre gonna be
please dont do this
you dont realize
this is good
this doesnt happen often in your life
we can figure this stuff out
i wanna help you
we need each other i havent even lied in two days
is that true
look at me
sam look at me
this is not over
im not putting a period at the end of this thing
im putting like
an ellipses on it
because im worried that if i dont go figure myself out if i dont go land on my feet and be okay on my own im gonna fuck this up
and i dont want to do that
this matters too much to me
he checks his watch
this isnt a conversation about this being over
its about me needing time to
look i just fired my psychiatrist i gotta go out and find a new one
he stares off
i gotta go
im gonna call you
as soon as i get there im gonna call you
she nods heartbroken
look at me
large cont t look at me
youve changed my life samantha
and ive known you for four days
this is the beginning of something big
but right now i gotta go
he kisses her on her mouth
as he pulls away she arcs her head to touch his lips for one more second
well paul is off tonight but were lucky enough to have ryan walker here to tell us about our weather
gideon sits on the edge of the bed cutting his toe nails
hes naked except for white underwear
the sound of water running in the bathroom
ryan hows it lookin out there
gideon doesnt hear the voice as he bends over and tries to pick each toenail hes cut out of the thick carpet
thank you dan
well i have some good news
we are in for some gorgeous weather coming our way out of the northwest
a scream and a bang from the female voice in the other room
gideons face as it whips up into frame from his task on the floor
he darts up off the floor and races to the open bathroom doorl he is about to enter and then hes stopped abruptly
sarah is drowning
through the door we see splashes of water as they land on the bathroom floor
he cant move fro en
his mind is racing adrenaline
we can almost see how fast his mind is processing through his eyes
the weather report continues low in the background
and then silence
gideons face wide eyed in terror
his fingers as they slide down off the bathroom door frame
he backs away slowly to the bed and site down staring blankly at the bathroom door
and then he starts to sob
quickly his whole body seems to surrender into it and he weeps hard
his whole back lurches upward with each soh
so there you have it folks get out the picnic baskets push up those storm windows cause it appears that spring has arrived
gideon looks up lost
his face is covered with tears
he reaches down to the phone and dials
i need an ambulance
sam cries in a phone booth
a knock on the glass spins her around to see large
he opens the door
what are you doing
remember that idea i had about growing and working stuff out on my own and then finding you when id figured myself out
yeah the ellipses
its an awful idea
and im not gonna do it
because like you said this is it
this is life
and im in love with you samantha
with a laugh i think thats the only thing ive ever been really sure of in my whole life
im really fucked up right now but i dont want to waste any more of my life without you in it
because i think i can do this
i know i can
i want to
we have to
tears stream down her face
she smiles her angelic smile
beat nodding what do we do
he looks at her and smiles like weve never seen him smile what do we do
they pause for a moment staring at each other transfixed by adrenaline and spontaneity
slowly large leans in and they kiss amidst an almost desolate baggage claim area
music cue radiohead sulk as one lone bag circles an empty carousel waiting to be found
