written by mark bomback patrick marber september th resting face up on a black surface
a beat of silence is broken by its abrupt ring
move in tighter on the phones lcd display
a number comes up ring
a hand enters frame
we follow it to a pad and pen we now discover to the left of the phone
the hand picks up the pen brings it to the pad on which we find a list of handwritten numbers
at least fifty
to this series is now added
we pan across the city skyline a beautiful sight over which we hear the clacking of computer keys
a wall of glass offers a letter boxed view of a sleek conference room
amber sconces illuminate an enormous table empty save for young man at the far end a lonely figure hunched over a laptop
steadily tighten on jonathan messer late s trim build not entirely at ease in a suit
likeable features suggest a gentle intelligent demeanor
grids of numbers from the laptop screen reflect off his glasses
tired he rubs his eyes continues typing
briefcase in hand jonathan walks a vacant corridor of empty cubicles
in a few offices lights are still on the figures of young men and women at work are blurred like photos out of focus behind the frosted glass of closed
waiting for his train jonathan pauses at a news kiosk
do you have tomorrows times yet
the grizzled old man behind the counter doesnt look up
it is tomorrow
the old man grudgingly bends to cut the plastic on a fresh stack of newspapers
as he does jonathan glances at numerous porn magazines on display
naked women smile back at him anything else
no thats it thanks
jonathan descends an above ground subway stop
neighborhood streets are vacant the clopping of his shoes the only sound
jonathan turns a corner heads for a humble duplex the first floor marked by unlit neon fleurs de solange
he ascends the steps his keys out jonathan
the voice from nowhere startles him he spins to find solange a vibrant haitian woman with a thick accent standing in the doorway below bundled in a ski jacket
solange youre up so late
so early jonathan
we open in one hour
so tell me you have been out with a lady friend oui
je suis desole madame mais no
but why else does a young man come home at such an hour
just working late thats all
every night working late working late
teasing him ah you cant fool me
you are mister mischief maker i know this
you come by
later and pick out something for your lady friend oui
furnishings are nice but sparse
jonathan hangs his suit jacket in a closet of empty hangers
not much decoration other than a dated jimmy connors poster and an old tennis trophy
jonathan lies in bed flipping channels on a small tv
typical late night stuff infommercials cnn a brazilian soccer match channel j public access on which x rated clips advertise phone sex
jonathan lingers a moment on these explicit ads then clicks back to the roaring soccer crowd
he closes his eyes and drifts off to the frenetic portuguese of an unseen announcer
two corporate lawyers are talking shop while pouring coffee
fixing his coffee jonathan reaches past them
they barely give him a glance as they continue their conversation
so the knicks win last night
im pretty sure yeah
actually they lost by
both pause turn to jonathan
jonathan smiles awkwardly
it was supposed to be a good game though
back to lawyer hey so
did you get a chance to look over that memo from watkins
bustling yet here too jonathan is ignored as he carries his coffee past assistants and lawyers talking shop
politely at those he passes few bother to smile in return
again jonathan works alone at one end of the long table rapidly typing eyes ping ponging from files to laptop beside him a meticulous arrangement of pastel colored post its
on which are scribbled various calculations
he strikes us as extremely good at his job tackling the overwhelming array of numbers and data with methodical assurance
taking a break he pauses to peer out the glass wall before him
behind the glass employees pass like fish in a tank
in a stall jonathan is staring sleepily at patterns in the stalls marble door when a sudden knock knock on the divider to his right startles him
he peers down and over to expensive black wingtip shoes a wall st
journal spread on the floor
another knock knock
confused jonathan turns to address the divider yes
take a look at this
the voice sounds youthful energetic
its owner slides his journal along the floor halfway between the marble division
the japanese are developing a toilet that can analyze your urine for glucose levels kidney disease even cancer
theyre referring to it as the super bowl
that certainly is something
of course if youve ever been to japan you know theyre nuts about their toilets
im talking web sites symposiums
you think im kidding
they have bowls over there that cost more than a piano
what i want to know is how youre supposed to retrieve this analysis you know from your super bowl
maybe theyre developing a fly with a nursing degree
whos in there anyway
uh jonathan messer
im from worth and berman
ive been over here a few wee a flush from the next stall cuts him off
the sound of zipping up of a belt buckled then of a stall door opening
so youre an accountant
jonathan follows the footsteps now addresses his stall door
audit manager yeah
so hows it work rutherford stern hires worth and berman to give their blessing to our books and they send you
have laptop will travel
what about you
what about me
well i didnt get your name for one
th the sound of a faucet running drowns him out
sorry i didnt catch that
gets no response hello
i said its wyatt
jonathan flushes buckles his belt opens his stall door only the mens room is now empty
three oh eight pee em
alone again jonathan listens to voice mail on his cell phone
find two more batteries sitting ready in a charger
just wanted to confirm youre wrapping up over there at rutherford stern because the controller at clancey has been on me to get someone in there by thursday
i told him how brilliant you are said youre the best auditor weve got
anyway i forwarded you some documentation
jonathan clicks his mouse to find a mails ending in worth berman
he reaches for his palm pilot clicks on a day planner stylus writes clancey into next week
other than places hell be working days are all entirely blank
jonathan still working
only a few of the post its now remain on the tabletop
yawning he glances at his watch a
startled jonathan turns to a well dressed young man in the doorway penetrating eyes playful smile familiar voice sorry if i scared you
i was heading home and saw the lights
we met before in the can
its wyatt right
wyatt bose nods as he steps into the room
theres something very likeably on about him
so do you normally work this late
im supposed to be out of here by tomorrow so im just trying to finish up
what about you
this is an early night
hard to believe that once upona time a mans success was measured by how little he had to work
you know in sweden the average worker gets weeks a year vacation
regards his stacked files do you like accounting
its all right if you enjoy working with numbers
do you like being a lawyer
its all right
if you enjoy working with assholes
jonathan laughs glances at his monitor screen
well im probably disturbing you no its okay
so worth and berman huh
dont you have to like be in mensa to work there
jonathan smiles shrugs modestly
been with them long
since my senior year of college
they subsidized my graduate degree
so you were poor
jonathan is given pause by the bluntness of the question
well i guess you could say that
i was raised by a single mother and she died when i was nineteen so
it wasnt so bad though
im sure a lot of people have had it worse
not around here
practically every suit i know is harvard by way of andover
by way of exeter
wyatt smiles takes a few idle paces
what do you say to a break
close on a screensaver of swimming fish
tilt up from jonathans laptop screen to wyatt and jonathan sitting on top of the expensive conference table passinga joint staring out at the rain hammering the far windows
its just sometimes i feel so i dont know removed
i mean i work for one of the biggest accounting firms in the world and
theres not so much as a desk there to prove it
theyve decided all we need are cell phones and laptops
messages are voice mailed documents e mailed salarys deposited online
chet peterson my senior manager
i swear he wouldnt recognize me if i was sitting in his chair
jonathan pauses takes another drag train of thought drifts i dont know
i used to have friends
but its like ive spent so much time trying to prove myself working these hours you can only do it so long before you look up and realize youve lost
just fell out of touch
and i try to meet people at work
but its always the same
to the accounting staff im a pain because for two weeks they have to hold their breath and hope i dont pick up on any of their screw ups
and to everyone else im just a temporary fixture so why bother
the truth is this is the first meaningful conversation ive had in i dont know how long
its like if i disappeared tomorrow im not
sure anyone other than solange would even notice shes my neighbor
i live on what must be the only block in brooklyn that still isnt hip
i guess i just never counted on the isolation
its like sometimes i look through that glass and i see life literally passing me by
jonathan stares out the glass wall in stoned silence
by the clock on the wall there
youve just talked for minutes straight
wyatt looks at jonathan and cracks up
jonathan hesitates then he too starts to laugh so now they cant stop their laughter filling the expansive room until its drowned by the sound advance of pouring rain
jonathan hurries in the cold
rain for the times square subway
hes just about to descend when across th avenue he spots a beautiful young woman in a camel hair coat clutching a slim briefcase waiting to cross the street
jonathan gazes at her almost gasping
shes surrounded by pedestrians with umbrellas
shes the only one without one and shes drenched
but she seems content to entertain herself drawing a pattern in the drops collecting on the umbrella in front of her
jonathan watches intrigued and then the rumble of the subway below reminds him hed better move
jonathan stands in a long line to buy a metrocard his glasses steamed up
he takes them off to wipe the lenses
jonathans pov the entire station is a blur all unfocused muted colors no object discernible from another until his glasses return his pov to immediate focus and he sees the
same young woman inthe camel
hair coat a pair of dollar bills in her hand entering the station
jonathan cant help but stare again
despite her business attire theres an almost childlike lightness
to her step
jonathan notices her slim briefcase
beneath her hand he can make out the first letter of a monogram s
she checks out the long line for metrocards considers waiting then decides lifes too short
she continues past headed for the turnstiles
jonathan continues to observe as she raises her briefcase then proceeds to wriggle her slender frame through the narrow gap in the turnstile
a panhandler on the other side watches her with amusement
glancing up she catches his eye and blushes a mischievous smile
once shes through she drops her money into his collection and slips out of view
angle on jonathan still stuck on line staring at the space she vacated
jonathan arrives as an n train pulls away the platform now practically
weary and still a bit stoned jonathan peers sleepily into the dark expanse of tunnel yawns and then he sees s is waiting on the same platform
ten yards away
he gazes at her
shes unwrapping some gum
he watches as she puts a piece in her mouth
the sound of an arriving n train
s heads for it jonathan follows
the train halts
the door before him is the last of its car the door before her the first of the next
the doors open
ii s a ii turns to jonathan excuse me is this the train for canal street
it takes jonathan a second just to find his voice
shes even more arresting up close
either one is i mean the n and the r both stop there so you know either way i mean this is the right train
sos of thanks
s enters her car
jonathan wavers wants to follow into her car but doesnt have the nerve
he enters a different car
jonathans slumped against a window annoyed
at himself for not getting in her car
he can see s
she sits in the other car chewing her gum
he studies her hes absolutely knocked out by her
next stop canal street
canal is next
he sees s rising to join the small crowd gathering by a door
jonathan stands up his last chance
determined he braces himself and rises grasping his briefcase
the screeching of brakes as the train grinds into canal st
a sudden jolt of the braking train
causes jonathan to stumble slightly and his briefcase bangs against a seat and snaps open contents tumbling out
his cell phone hits the floor
jonathan quickly bends for his phone when the train lurches to a halt nearly knocking him over and sliding his cell phone a few feet along the grimy floor
we hear the hiss of the doors opening as jonathan grabs for his phone a second before its stepped on
he hurriedly stuffs it in his pocket shoves his files and papers and paraphernalia back into his briefcase and rises to his feet to find the doors closing and s
devastated he hurries to a window searching the platform as the train begins to depart
he can just glimpse the back of her camel hair coat as his car is sucked back into a tunnel
he stands helpless just shuts his eyes and lowers his head
jonathan is pouring coffee when he brightens on hearing wyatt enter talking animatedly with lawyers and
caught up in telling his joke wyatt doesnt seem to notice jonathan
only when the lawyers burst out laughing does wyatt glance up
his eyes meet jonathans
jonathan smiles in greeting but wyatt just nods coolly returns to his fellow lawyers
jonathans smile falters
he exits wordlessly
jonathan hands over files and cd roms to a less than sociable i guess thats it
nice meeting you
jonathan turns to go takes two paces then turns back
listen could you point me toward wyatt boses office
the assistant controller looks up in mild annoyance
hes an attorney here
she sighs put upon then slides out a desk drawer in which a laminated page of names and extensions is taped
jonathans eyes follow her lazy finger down the list hey quit looking down her shirt
jonathan instinctively leaps back from her desk turns to find wyatt grinning at him from down the corridor
so where to next
clancey funds on thursday
clute nichols after that
wyatts about to reply when another lawyer passes him in the hall
wyatt taps the lawyers shoulder
hey wait up a sec
smiles back well good meeting you jonathan
wyatt turns and starts to walk off with the other lawyer
jonathan bends for his briefcase wait so you have off tomorrow
jonathan looks up to wyatt smiling at him from down the hall
you dont happen to have
decent backhand do you
beneath an enormous bubble dome jonathan and wyatt play mixed doubles with two attractive young women early s
between points we observe from jonathans side of the net wyatt chatting up his partner
the rapport between jonathan and his partner is markedly less comfortable he wipes his brow smiles at her she forces a polite smile in return
a good rally underway
jonathan fires a backhand
wyatt returns it with an audible grunt
jonathan snaps the ball back to wyatts partner only wyatt intercepts nailing it back
jonathan returns it with equal force
a grin on wyatts face as he savors the battle blasting back each ball
the women step aside
jonathan lunges barely managing to lob a return
sensing victory wyatt raises his racket and with a guttural bark mercilessly smashes the ball
jonathan dives racket over extended and returns a near perfect shot just over wyatts head
but it lands two inches outside the opposite baseline
jonathan curls forward gasping for air
silence then wyatts solitary applause echoes in the humid space
they shake hands at the net
jonathan is exhausted
develop akiller instinct and youll beat the crap out of me
jonathan turns to commiserate with his partner but shes already gone to join her friend
jonathan crashes out on the court
from his low angle he watches as wyatt goes over to the girls and says something that causes a burst of laughter
the girls finally wave goodbye
wyatt hops over the net
they asked if wed fancy a post game cocktail
dont worry i got us out of it
jonathan is barely able to speak
i wouldve been happy to
are you kidding
theyre a couple of first years at merrill
screw that we can do better
hey you ok
jonathan nods as an amused wyatt helps him to his feet
soft jazz plays as wyatt leads jonathan past the bar area
wyatt is admiring jonathans weathered tennis racket
man i remember when these first came out
i think i was a frosh at boarding school
chuckles fingers a string jeez are these strings natural gut
actually its a hybrid weave natural gut and kevlar
theyre pretty obscure now
i should replace them theyre all frayed
looking up jonathan abruptly slows his pace his eyes suddenly fixed on a woman sitting at the far end of the bar
from behind it looks remarkably like s
only as she turns her profile proves otherwise
wyatt and jonathan in towels heading for the showers
jonathan still deep in the s moment have you ever considered contacts
jonathan halts confused to find wyatt studying his face his eyeglasses in particular
oh yeah i tried once but i was allergic to something in the solution
you have an attractive face
your eyes especially
jonathan looks self conscious in his towel
its not a come on just an observation
considers him a beat you dont get much do you
what you mean sex
no flood insurance
how many women have you slept with
oh i dont know not a whole of course you know
okay fine just four
what about you
i have no idea
you just said everyone i meant everyone like you
confused jonathan looks up as wyatt disappears into a shower stall
jonathan emerges freshly showered a towel around his waist as he walks toward the rows of lockers
im on the list
jonathan finds wyatt half dressed seated on a bench by a locker and talking on his cell phone
there better be
wyatt hangs up looks up to find jonathan staring puzzled
jonathan reaches into his locker for his hanging jacket and pulls out his own cell phone
its identical to wyatts
we have the same phone
oh and you thought i was using yours
i can afford my own phone calls you know
no i wasnt of course you can im pulling your dick jonathan
grins slams his locker actually i was just firming up some plans for tonight
are you free
sure i guess but i dont want to youre not
what do you say are you in
i guess i could go home and change
forget it you can borrow something of mine
a three story brownstone in an expensive west village neighborhood
as wyatt leads jonathan to the staircase they pass a papery faced gentleman s in a fine suit
t a uten abend herr kleiner
glances back this way jonathan
urban chic to a serious degree
big terrace funky furniture framed snapshots of wyatt with similarly hip and attractive young friends and great art including an entrancing image of a burning candle just slightly out of
its a gerhard richter
kleiner downstairs is a hot shot art dealer he hooked me up with the gallery in munich
wyatt disappears into the next room
alone jonathan wanders pauses by the framed snapshots
the young people in them are like wyatt beautiful strong wealthy
jonathan pauses by one photo in which wyatt looks a bit younger his hair bleached blonde and loosely spiked
talk about a bad look
startled jonathan quickly turns to find wyatt standing right behind him
a slick expensive suit draped over his arm
here try this one
off jonathans hesitation what
nothing i just hope i can pull it off
you hope you can pull it off
you know who you remind me of
a guy i roomed with freshman year at princeton
real smart witty too when you loosened him up
only from day one he just didnt fit in
for starters he was dirt poor
but it wasnt that
see there was always this boundary this wall between getz and everyone else
you could argue we laid the foundation but he built it
built it by believing the lie
that he was any different
the clothes the money the wry anecdotes its all one big masquerade
anyone can get in youve just got to wear a costume
but getz never got that
he assumed he could never scale the wall when the truth is he was the only one guarding it
it never occurred to him his anonymity could be an asset
no one gets over like the guy whos just a face an impression
we are all of us only who were perceived to be
so what happened to him
who james getz
oh he killed himself
hesitates a beat youre pulling my dick arent you
wyatt turns to him with a grave look
with both hands
jonathan cant help but laugh as wyatt hands him the suit
close on a buff young man emcee in a vintage bowler hat
he struts up to us thumbs in his suspenders and now straight from the cafe germaine the velvet rope is proud to introduce you to the lovely miss lu lu
an ultra elite new burlesque nightclub in manhattan s parisian decor
strictly upscale patrons male and female sip from crystal barware while on stage a betty page type performs an elegantly choreographed strip tease
wyatt and jonathan sit at a small table each table is fitted with
an old fashioned black rotary telephone as well as a small monitor recessed into the tabletop on which old stag films play silently
all part of the wink wink ambience
its a little self conscious but i thought youd get a kick out of it
hows that suit working out
oh great actually
keep it then
ive got two just like it
jonathans about to protest when a waitress arrives
two macallan year
isnt this like fifty bucks a glass
well try not to spill any
regards the floor show so whats the wildest thing youve ever done
sexually i mean
the wildest thing
oh i dont know ive never been too adventuresome
all right whats the lamest thing then
wyatts focused on him amused eager to hear it
actually that was probably a few months ago
i was flipping through money magazine and saw this small ad in the back
it read something like are
you feeling all alone
looking to meet women but have forgotten how
and there was this number
and you called it
so what happened
the phone just kept ringing
and thats it
wyatt stares at jonathan a beat then starts to crack up
lame enough for you
you called a sex ad from money magazine
that is beyond lame
jonathan too starts laughing when the phone at their table lightsup
wyatt looks to jonathan raises a brow then picks up
he listens a moment smiles hands it to jonathan
wyatt taps his shoulder directs his gaze to a sexy brunette at a distant table receiver to her ear eyeing jonathan
jonathan hangs up turns to wyatt
she wants to dance
jonathan is slow dancing with the sexy brunette to an old edith piaf ballad
he looks over her shoulder to his table where wyatt is sitting talking on his cell phone
glancing up wyatts eyes meet jonathans he flashes a proud smile
jonathan continues dancing truly enjoying himself
the brunette leans in whispers something in his ear
wyatt clicks off his cell phone looks up to find jonathan returning alone looking deflated
shes a hooker
wyatt shrugs grinning
hold on you knew
what are all the women here prostitutes
that depends on what you mean by that word
stretch the definition and you could incorporate most of the men as well
sips his drink you know in amsterdam prostitutes not only belong to a union they have to pay taxes
you seem to possess quite a store of international trivia
i just get around
its not like she just shot your dog
i was only trying to help
besides what are you looking for a relationship
as if you have time for one
this was your first day off in how long
four for me
face it weve mortgaged our youth
pimped out our twenties
but we still have needs
and theres nothing shameful about wanting them met
so you sleep with hookers
so how do you meet your needs
wyatt studies him a beat another french love song drifting in the background as the emcee introduces a new girl
what if i told you
breaks off laughs christ i sound like an infommercial
what were you going to say
you dont think that women have these same urges
young women just like ourselves successful and working their asses off to stay that way
you better believe they do
and well lets just say theres a way
a way it can be taken care of
you make it sound like a mob hit
wyatt smiles and turns his attention back to the floor show
wyatt and jonathan are in the back seat
a quiet beat
what you were talking about before
wyatt turns to jonathan with a grin some other time
at the corner please
the rhiga royal
to jonathan listen i have to meet someone
the cab pulls up before the rhiga royal hotel
you had a good time tonight
yeah i did
listen that thing with the hooker im really sorry if i forget it
it was funny
wyatt smiles warmly pats jonathans shoulder
ill give you a call tomorrow
wyatt climbs out
jonathan watches through the cab window as wyatt disappears into the golden glow of the lobby
later driving in the cab jonathan catches his reflection in the glass
he smiles liking how he looks in wyatts suit
outside rainy manhattan passes by ina hypnotic blur
to driver hey
could you let me out at the next corner over there on th avenue
jonathan stands in the exact spot where he first saw s
he buys a new york times and a hot dog
pedestrians and theatre crowds pass by as he remains rooted to the spot
hoping hell see that face in the crowd
after a while he shakes his head at the ridiculousness of it and heads down into the subway
clanceys stiff controller s hovers nervously over jonathan as he unloads files onto the huge conference table
beside him we see hes set up his laptop phone charger pencils and a fresh unopened pack of pastel post its
any problems youll want to see julie levinson shes our assistant controller or if shes busy scott werner our senior accountant
if werners unavailable we have two staff accountants but like i said i dont anticipate any problems
i mean weve never had any before so
i just need the access codes for the accounts and sub accounts
the controller suddenly looks uneasy
youve got account numbers but no access codes
without those i cant get the banks to authorize statement verification
beat smiles besides how else can i steal the money
nothing i was just pulling your leg
i do need those codes though when you get a chance
other than jonathans suit and tie the reduced number of post its and the lighter stack of files little has changed
jonathan is hunched over his laptop
like rutherford sterns conference room this one too is designed with a glass wall
jonathan peers out at workers passing in utter indifference to him
slightly different tank slightly different fish
close on a business card a rutherford stern masthead beneath it wyatts name and office number
jonathan picks up his cell phone and dials it
ring hey jonathan
howd you know it was
you really ought to block your caller id
so same place as yesterday
along the entire square of ledge throngs of suited business types bundled in scarves eating street vendor fare
its here we find wyatt and jonathan having a quick bite
i wonder what the founding fathers would make of this scene
wyatt regards face after face of young men and women wearing expensive suits wolfing down lunch so they can get back to work a good of them talking on cell
phones as they eat
im just glad to be outside
awkwardly heartfelt ive got to tell you this has been great meeting up for lunch
i used to just a cell phone rings
they both instinctively reach in their jackets take out their identical phones
its wyatts thats ringing
jonathan rests his down on the ledge
okay see if you can
gettme on the out of jfk tonight
wyatt rests his phone on the ledge next to jonathans
rutherford needs me to join him asap in london to paper some financing with lloyds
i tell you about this
no no you didnt
yeah i should be gone a few weeks
jonathan tries to mask the wave of loneliness setting in
nah itll be boring as sin
wyatt studies him a moment grabs his cell phone and rises from the ledge
shit id better get back
sitting before his laptop jonathan takes out his cell phone and punches in some numbers
he enters the numbers again receives the same prerecorded message
he hangs up when it abruptly rings surprising him
he stares at the phone a curious beat then answers it
jonathan mess click
more puzzled jonathan frowns a beat then replaces the battery with one fresh off the charger
as ignored as ever jonathan is squeezed among employees on their way home
two secretaries speak in hushed tones thats just it
you caught him in a lie so now everything he says you have to ring of a cell phone
surprised he takes out the phone presses talk
a soft electronic rustle from the other end
then are you free tonight
i asked if youre free tonight
im sorry i think you have the wrong click
the line goes dead
jonathan trudging home
he descends into the subway
jonathan is heading for the downtown n r when
his cell phone again
he steps aside and answers hello
the crackle of static on the other end
then are you free tonight
actually i am but i dont think im who the static on the other end worsens
im sorry i didnt get that
i said i am free but i could you be at the plaza in one hour
i i guess but beneath the eloise portrait
the roar of a train pulling in
only when the train passes can he hear the other end
but now theres no one there
jonathan stares at his cell phone and frowns
close on the phones display as jonathan scrolls down its list of stored numbers
his expression says none are familiar
and now he gets it
a heavy set cabbie glances in his mirror at jonathan in back cell phone to his ear
into phone hi its jonathan ive got your cell
i guess you must have mine
i imagine youre in the air now but call when you get this
if you do
oh and you got a call from someone who im
forget it just call me
jonathan hangs up
so where ya visiting from
youre from out of town right
i can usually tell
you seem like a tourist
ive lived here all my life
no offence pal
the cabbie pulls over on central park south
jonathan leans forward peers up at the gorgeous french renaissance facade
well here ya are
wealthy guests stroll chat lounge
hotel staff in immaculate uniforms greet assist etc
jonathan anxiously wanders the perimeter then slows as he spies a portrait of a precocious little girl grinning at him
jonathan is standing awkwardly beneath the eloise portrait glancing at his watch growing restless unsure
pardon me but may i ask you something personal
jonathan quickly looks
up to find standing before him an attractive blonde woman
around his age slender to the point of stark dressed in a chic grey business suit
are you waiting for me
i think so yes
youre here for wyatt right
hesitates appraising him im sorry did we speak earlier
yes we did good
lets go then
jonathan and the blonde stand in an elevator alongside an elderly couple
the couple smile at the handsome pair
jonathan fidgets uncomfortably
the woman is staring at the lit numbers
he notices a room key in her hand
whispers aside look i dont think im i mean you and i
we dont know each other
she turns to him the slightest smile on her thin lips
the doors open
she steps out
walls carpeting details all classically gorgeous
the blonde keeps a quick pace headed toward a room
what i mean to say is im fairly certain theres been some kind of mistake
she stops dead in her tracks her back to him
youre not who i spoke with on the phone
no i mean yes but youre not attracted to me
oh no its not that at all its just its just what
she turns steps toward him
jonathan opens his mouth to explain when she covers it with hers
it takes him a moment to succumb to her kiss
but not too long
a smooth plane of pressed sheets creases as two bare bodies lower to them
the blonde hovering over him jonathans tentativeness is all but gone
jonathan cradles her to him her features softening under waves of pleasure as she gasps and whispers in soft slow annunciation as if it were the sweetest word in our
later jonathan lies post coital
and then a look of mild anxiety whats going on
he turns to the blonde but shes fast asleep
on the sound of a door shutting jonathans eyes squint open
still naked he props himself up leans over to find hes all alone
a clock radio reveals itself as the source of the faint classical music we hear
the time reads am
he rises glances around the room
no sign of her
showered and dressed jonathan is talking with a desk clerk
sir im showing that room as having checked out at this morning
well could you tell me the name of the guest who was staying there
im afraid were not allowed to disclose information regarding our guests
if you give me her name i can confirm if she was registered here
actually the thing is
jonathan exits to good tidings from the bell staff
lost in his thoughts it takes him a moment to respond
he starts to walk
his cell rings
hey youre up early
so youve got mine and ive
listen last night
i met this damn
sorry im gonna have to call you back they want me in a meeting
hey no long distance calls okay
wyatt hangs up
jonathan shakes his head amused
he hails a cab glances back at the hotel
his lips curl into a vaguely proud if still dazed smile
jonathan sits alone at the long conference table working but distracted
he pauses eyes wyatts cell phone sitting there
the numbers stored have no names associated with them
its just a series of undesignated seven digit sequences a list of phone numbers that seems to go on and on
jonathan clicks on a number at random
it highlights itself
jonathan hesitates then clicks again
the number is dialled
ring a woman with an elegant british accent answers yes
hello um im sorry to bother you how did you get this number
through a friend
i think youve got the wrong number
now if youll excuse me wait jonathan fumbles for what else to say before she hangs up
close on jonathan
what to say
and then braces himself swallows are you free tonight
he shuts his eyes ready for a hang up
a long silence
i can be
jonathan opens his eyes half in disbelief
im afraid thats a bit uptown for me
perhaps the mercer
say by the shakespeare half past eleven
it should be fairly evident
the soho industrial motif is the antithesis of the plaza
by a vintage book library we find a sleekly dressed young black woman perusing spines of salinger scott sheherazade excuse me um im sorry to disturb you she turns regards
him a moment curiously a copy of shakespeares a midsummer nights dream in her hand
im supposed to meet someone here and youre rather new to this arent you
i like that
she enters first then jonathan
he waits for her
to push a button only it seems shes waiting for him to do the same
im sorry what floor
she rolls her eyes
jonathan and british accent cross the lobby once more
frankly im surprised that whoever gave you access didnt explain more
right then the rules one
no names no jobs no nothing
two latex is mandatory and non negotiable
three no rough stuff the only rule thats even remotely malleable provided theres mutual consent although i say if thats your thing take it elsewhere
she halts a few feet from the registration desk
the initiator is responsible for the room
takes him a second oh so i should
jonathan is holding a key card
british accent is leaning against the opposite wall eyeing him with a slight grin
the elevator doors open
they are headed for a room as he ventures another question so are there a lot of people who do this
she turns to him with a look of growing impatience when the creak of a cart causes them to glance up a room service waiter is crossing past the far
end of the hall
jonathan turns back to find her staring at him uneasily
how did you get into this
well a friend of mine he uploaded your numbers but failed to explain the basics
hes well he was going out of town
off her frown im doing something wrong arent i
its not that its just
well you strike me as something of a stowaway
in fact if i were more suspicious id say you didnt belong here at all
flustered jonathans about to offer some explanation but obviously somebody felt you did
the notion suddenly registers with jonathan wyatt
and im a sucker for bashful boys
she takes his wrist traces a finger over his palm
and removes the key card from his hand
jonathan and british accent having sex
she has his arms pinned back writhing on top of him clearly enjoying the control jonathan remains awed just enjoying the ride
jonathan lies in bed beside british accent
can i ask you something
why do you do this
why are any of us doing this
for the economics of the arrangement
rolls over away from him its intimacy without intricacy
jonathans about to reply look ive got a a
she says no more
jonathan stares up at the ceiling a beat
well good night
she doesnt reply
alone at his laptop the stack of files down to a bare few
he dials a number on his cell into phone hey i never heard back from you
i guess youre busy
with stuff over there
smiles to himself ive been kinda busy too
ive been wondering did you mean for me to take your phone
jonathan walks the carpet draped sidewalk toward the entrance then pauses looks around in recognition of this same spot where wyatt had gotten out of the cab that night
ive got a feeling you did
i can see you grinning right now
jonathan returns the bell staffs chipper greetings and steps inside anyway i just wanted to say
soundtrack music swelling to herald a montage jonathan seems somewhat more relaxed as he lingers in the lobby
a woman with a boyish haircut taps his shoulder
jonathan and an asian woman having sex on a plush celadon carpet two briefcases resting side by side a few feet away
alone as usual jonathan now seems strangely contented in this isolated state
workers pass in the wall of glass but now he doesnt bother looking up
in his briefcase we note the inclusion of a toiletries bag
at a registration desk jonathan hands his credit card to a desk clerk
a bellhop gestures to a luggage cart
jonathan shakes his head looking confidently past him to a tall woman seated inconspicuously among the various out of towners
jonathan wakes up alone his necktie knotted around a bedpost
he reaches for the phone presses room service
jonathan is waiting to make some copies when the secretary at the copier hands him a stack of paper
can you hold these
only the voice belongs to the woman jonathan is having sex with referring to her legs that she wraps around him
jonathan buys a bottle of o
and a count box of condoms
carrying his coffee mug jonathan suddenly slows his eyes locked on the blonde with whom hed first been at the plaza
her eyes fix on his as he
nears a flash of mutual recognition
then nothing as they pass without a word
jonathan cant help but allow himself the slightest grin
jonathan wades confidently through a sea of young executives
he approaches a redheaded businesswoman
he asks her something
she looks up confused when another redhead taps his shoulder
her free hand slips into his
their fingers interlocking
pull back from interlocked fingers to find jonathans hand entwined with another womans
we realize were watching their image in a mirror when we pan away from the mirror
to jonathan and yet another woman having sex
the bed keeps banging against the night stand a glass of water moving closer to the edge with every bang
theres something almost rote about it a numbness in the repetition
the glass falls hits the ground and breaks
match cut to jonathan plunges into water
jonathan doing laps
he emerges from the pool strides with confidence past the tourists flanking him on either side older couples snoozing parents adjusting floaties on kids business travellers with airport novels
he continues toward us hair slicked back like wyatts
jonathan arrives at his buildings steps to find solange hurrying out of her flower shop
she embraces him warmly
jonathan for so long i dont see you
jai ete tres occupe
and no longer so exhilarated by his nightly activities
you believe you can trick me mr
i want to meet this lady friend of yours
jonathan is about to protest ah
ah ecoutez i have beautiful winter roses just
jonathan smiles but theres a reticence to it
maybe later okay
there is no later when it comes to love
if you find it you must not let it go
jonathan nods absently continues up the steps when she tugs his sleeve
he turns to her she searches his eyes
there really is no one
jonathan evasively shakes his head
there should be jonathan
it is not good for a young man to be too much alone
he gives her an uncomfortable smile
she smiles back but as she heads inside she looks both sad and worried for him
jonathan continues up the steps opens the front door and disappears inside
we remain on the vacant street hear his footsteps climbing the steps and then the muted ring of his cell phone
a beat then another
and the front door opens again as jonathan steps back out into the night
checking his reflection in a mirror while he waits jonathan faintly hears what sounds like wyatts laugh
he quickly turns to the sound a bar off the lobby
through slotted glass he scans the backs of heads a group of business men
reflected in the mirror a woman appears behind him
jonathan freezes his eyes grow wide excuse me
he doesnt breathe
utterly stunned he turns to confirm
jonathan stares at her in sheer disbelief but shes oblivious smiling casually back at him
s enters first flips on the light proceeds inside
jonathan enters tentatively behind her eyes still glued
s takes off her coat drapes it over a chair
jonathan remains still and silent just watching
she undoes the wrists of her blouse then the collar button
jonathan is about to say something but cant
she undoes the next button
we can glimpse a bra
she undoes the next before we
um the thing is i know you
she glances up curious her hand lingering by the front clasp of her bra
not know exactly but we sort of met before
in the times square subway station
it was raining
az s az in the subway
you had no umbrella
you were soaked
its true i dont have an umbrella
then you asked me if the n train stops at canal
she squints back at him vaguely recalling him
she smiles warmly and continues to unbutton her blouse
azsa is something the matter
this just seems strange thats all
because youve seen me before
i dont know its just ever since that night on the train ive thought about how nice it would be to see you again
and now suddenly here you are taking off your clothes
az s of bingo
so whats the problem
its just that a generous smile hmm it is kind of a gear shift
she starts to button her blouse back up
azsaz well maybe some other time
jonathan is thrown as she reaches for her coat wait dont go
she glances back curiously
what i mean is by any chance
are you hungry
a bellman rolls a cart noiselessly down the carpet placing early editions of the new york times before each room
he pauses by a door quietly leaves anewspaper
we can hear the sound of jonathan and s talking and laughing
they sit across from each other indian style on the bed
the radio is tuned to a pop music station
theyre finishing a meal of burgers and fries getting along famously
you have some ketchup on your chin
sorry im a messy eater
azsaz me too
jonathan rubs at his chin with a napkin misses
she takes the napkin dabs it in water and cleans him up
they continue to eat for a while eyeing each other between bites
um i think theres a little piece of
onion in my hair
she laughs and flicks it
they get everywhere
by the way my names azs
she puts her finger to his lips
a first touch
an electricity between them
azc a playful smile you know the rules
the rules seem to specify no conversation either
they are a little rigid arent they
but i think we should obey the no names
itll be fun
ah but i know
yours begins with an s
azsir is that right
i saw part of the monogram on your briefcase
s if i see excellent work holmes

her face is an inch from his the moment mysterious and sexy
holmes voice hmrn

she sports a camel coat a briefcase and possesses no umbrella

sexy steffi soaking in the rain

sally with three ls

jonathan rubs his chin
the mysterious s alighted from the train at canal street
she may well be from downtown
how foolish ive been sinead
s giggles charmed by him
do i look like a sunbeam
to me you are sunbeam
then so be it
jonathan considers this a moment and concedes
can i ask what you do for a living
i sit behind glass and watch people pass like fish
she smiles a more interesting answer than she expected
you work in a bank
im kind of an accountant

im living the dream
feel free to leave now
u s az still here
so what about you
azsa no were still on you frank
off jonathans look frank
you look like a frank
so frank when you were a little boy what did you wanna be when you grew up
confesses a pro tennis player
i wanted to be an umpire
i loved the idea of sitting in that big high chair
umpire voice the ball was good mr mcenroe
i can see it
an s new wave love song comes on the radio
she beams reaching across jonathan to turn it up
a s i used to love this song
s stands up on the bed starts to dance
she reaches her hand out to jonathan
he smiles shakes his head
trust me its not a pretty sight
ill be the judge of that
he hesitates then takes her hand rises to his feet and starts to dance with her
hes self conscious at first but shes agile enough to guide him and soon hes into it
is s il see
you just need the right partner
she closes her eyes swaying with the music
they dance together
hes falling even harder for her
as the song ends she holds his gaze when a small yawn escapes her
she covers her mouth
of s az im so sorry
suddenly im crashing
she drops down on the bed tugging him down with her
they lie back side by side
id like to see you again
not in a hotel
it s hmm
id have to think about that
how about tomorrow
s to it is tomorrow
she curls up next to him rests her head on his arm closes her eyes and drifts off
jonathan gazes over at her
the perfect line of her jaw
the petite divot above her lip
the tiny pierced comma in a presently unadorned earlobe
and then he notices in the far corner her purse
he stares at it her name and personal details less than feet away
he hesitates then tries to silently slide his arm out from under her when she stirs and nuzzles closer
he looks over
to the purse then back at s sleeping peacefully on his arm
and chooses this perfect moment over knowing any more
close on jonathans sleeping face
his eyes slowly open
jonathans pov her purse is no longer on the chair
he raises his head sees that shes gone
he stares at her pillow
the indentation where she slept
smiles to himself
he gets out of bed and heads for the bathroom
theres a note on the desk on hotel note paper frank you snore like a tractor
will call u later
sunbeam xxx he stares at the note beaming when his cell phone rings
jonathan picks it up
are you free tonight
a bea and then wyatts familiar laughter

because i thought i saw you last night at the hudson
the hudson huh

what do you mean by that

yeah yeah yeah but sometimes you just have to go with what you feel dont you
hold on a sec
muffled sounds of wyatt talking to someone else
its non stop back to back bullshit here
listen ill call you later
and hey congratulations
wyatt hangs up
and then reads the note again grinning
the morning crush of executives filing toward elevators
among them we spot jonathan just slightly out of step a sleepy smile lingering on his face
jonathan is working on his laptop clearly distracted
he looks at his cell phone hoping it will ring but it doesnt
he calls up the list of recent calls incoming scrolls up to the top number
it reads number unavailable
jonathan looks worried wondering how he can get a hold of her when his cell phone rings
he immediately picks up
unfamiliar voice are you free tonight
i think you have the wrong number
jonathan arrives at the subway station
hes a little anxious now still hasnt heard from her
he lingers at the top of the stairs not wanting to descend
below him he can hear the lonely roar of a train pulling in below
only when the train quiets down does jonathan realize his cell phone is ringing
he picks up
intermittent static on the other end
and then what sounds like a woman gasping its unclear if its a sound of pleasure or pain
the gasping comes faster jonathan debates hanging up when the gasps halt replaced by the faintest whisp of a female voice no
theres no mistaking the tone now its fear then
suddenly a shrill terrified scream
and the line goes dead
jonathan stares breathlessly at the phone in his hand like hes just witnessed something awful
he quickly checks the display number unavailable
jonathan looks panicked with the possibility that it was s when the phone rings again
he hesitates then picks up
are you free tonight
jonathan exhales in relief on hearing her voice
jonathan stands on a corner looking out of place amidst the glistening neon and bustle of asian faces
he peers anxiously down the
street checks his watch all anticipation when something is wrapped around his eyes
hes startled tugs it off and spins to find s smiling back at him
if s ill i bought you a present
she drapes the scarf around his neck
its all striped bright colors all the more funky against his dark suit
i knew it
you look smashing
sure you dont mean clashing
she laughs then notices how tense he seems
saz are you all right
i got a call before yours im not sure if it was real or if it was even meant for me but there was a woman who sounded like she
was being i dont know hurt
s seems instantly on edge
something about this scares her
if sip you dont know who she was
shakes his head it couldve been a prank
now youre the one who looks scared
saz no its just it sounds creepy thats all
she shakes it off mustering a smile as she takes his arm
azsaz come on
a makeshift street market everything from fish and meat to cheap electronics for sale in cramped stands
jonathan and s walk arm in arm through the packed crowd like a couple
jonathan looks like weve never seen him before a fascination with everything around him especially her
they pause at a stall selling cheap trinkets including a small metallic wind up toy of a duck riding a bicycle
hes so cute
whats his name
duck on bike
s beams like its the greatest name ever
an intimate place jonathan and s are the only patrons at this late hour
they sit across from each other grinning at duck on bike as it totters across the table trips over a chopstick and flails on its side
t s az oh poor duck on bike
she uprights the toy and it keeps on moving across the table
you gotta respect him he just keeps at it
a waiter arrives and sets down a laminated menu entirely in chinese
s points to the characters like an expert
ft well have this
oh and lets try one of these
the waiter nods walks off
what did you order
az s of i have absolutely no idea
how do you know well like it
how do you know we wont
jonathan gazes at her a beat
this is so
not my life
az az is that a good thing
more than you know
jonathan looks at her
ever since that night on the subway i havent stopped thinking about you
sorry i didnt mean to freak you out
she slowly looks up again touched
azsaz are you always so honest
even so im not sure i believe you
jonathans look why not
az youre in the sex club
another anonymous guy looking for anonymous action
im not judging you im in
there too but dont say youve been solemnly holding atorch for me for how long is it wow one whole month
but ive thought about you a lot
in between the mindless shtupping
and sometimes during
the waiter brings them their drinks
so how come you got involved in the club
she frowns slightly thinks
if wouldnt it be great if you could just meet someone and not have to do the work family previous relationships thing
isnt who we are right now so much more interesting than where weve come from
but that didnt really answer my question
she reaches over and takes his hand holds it tenderly
az s of i know it seems like im holding out on you but im not
its just i turned thirty this year and i made this vow to live only in the present
and its good you know
and yes maybe its because there are things in my past i dont care to think about but thats the same for everyone isnt it
he nods still holding hands loving every moment of this
az i like you
i hope you like me
cant that be enough
jonathan smiles completely disarmed by her
the waiter brings their food and goes
i wasnt asking for an autobiography you know
i was just curious
is a beat a woman i know used to do it
so i decided to give it a try
for various reasons it suits my present situation
you mean the intimacy without intricacy
it has its merits
at least i thought it did
until you came along
he beams gazing at her
blushing she starts in on the food
outside we can hear rain starting to fall
jonathan and s step out into pouring rain pause under the shabby awning
waiters inside are putting chairs on tables
she fishes in her coat and pulls out a pack of gum
the wrapper is entirely in chinese
she offers him a piece
oh no thanks
dont let the wrapper intimidate you
i buy it at a store nearby
it has ginseng in it you know for energy
its not bad though it sort of tastes like hairspray
she chews her gum
he watches her the jaw line her lips
she looks at him and smiles but theres something behind it a sadness
almost an uneasiness
hey are you all right
i dont want to complicate your life
i want all the complication youve got
she gazes at him blinks back her emotions
it sc your glasses
theyre fogging up
she reaches out and gently removes his glasses
she wipes the lenses then peering into his eyes slowly leans in to return them to his face
only she presses her lips to his instead the glasses still in her hand the kiss itself at once tender and passionate
she absently lowers her hand lost in the unexpected intensity of the kiss
embraced they accidentally step under the sheet of water falling off the awning
jonathan guides her back beneath the awnings shelter
at s is breathless whisper maybe you should go
maybe you should stay
she smiles as he kisses her even more passionately
again they feel the awnings drops and jonathan moves to shelter them only s leans into him instead leading him out from under the awning the falling rain suddenly drenching
their faces as they continue to kiss the moment purely exhilarating
wiping the rain from her face jonathan gazes at her soaked and utterly beautiful with something akin to awe like hes just breathed for the very first time
rack focus on a hotel down the street its neon sign reads hotel lotus
jonathan and s lying on the bed in their white hotel bath robes underwear on his arm around her as they watch tv
he strokes her hair
she nuzzles up to him
she changes channels
finds some tennis
they watch together
so were you any good
but i didnt want it enough
the guys who make it really need it
i played recently first time in years
ive got this friend a new friend hes great
maybe youll meet him one day
anyway we played and he creamed me
but i knew i was better than him
he said i had no killer instinct
it i dont know i think youre a pretty determined character
on a level with this feller
he points to duck on bike watching over them like a charm
given the chance i believe you could be
she idly flips channels finds a romantic melodrama an old black and white film
they settle back to watch
i know we said we wouldnt rush
but for the record im doing everything ican to apply
the brakes here
of me too
and for the record id like nothing more than to make love right now
but im kind of glad we decided to wait
its a wise and mature choice weve made
our parents would be proud
jonathan is wild with lust for her
but say we did just say
say we were to suddenly tear off these robes
would that be such a terrible thing
for two people in manhattan azs
in the small hours on a wet winters night
to consummate their deep human needs in a frenzy of
fucking and sucking
you were saying
who who would blame these two people
is az who could possibly judge them
they face each other breathing deeply almost panting
and who would know
his face is inches from hers when she rolls over and reaches for a glass of water on the night stand
she sips her water as she turns back to jonathan
still jonathan picks up on her subtle shift
is everything okay
she starts to say something then stops herself and nods instead
she sets down her glass starts to get out of bed
where are you going
i az a mischievous smile for ice
a lusty grin ice huh
i saw a machine down the hall
ill be right back
she starts to tie her robe closed
thats all right ill go
he hops off the bed grabs an ice bucket from the mini bar and a key card from the table he surreptitiously adjusts his penis as one does and goes
to the door
hes about to turn the handle when saz wait glancing back yes
she hesitates a cryptic beat then shakes her head and smiles at him with immense tenderness
jonathan beams back
p hurry okay
he blows her a kiss she blows one back
almost in slow motion
she looks stunning
as jonathan exits the room hold on the room number
jonathan runs down the long corridor to the ice machine
hes giddy with excitement
at the ice machine an eccentric old woman in her night attire is slowly filling a bucket
piece by piece
her weak gnarly hands plucking at the blocks not wanting to break her long nails
jonathan hops around in an agony of frustration
she turns looks him up and down he feels a bit self conscious in his robe and bare feet
would you like some help maam
i can manage thank you
finally her bucket is full and she goes on her way
jonathan quickly fills his bucket with ice
returning down the empty hall ice bucket in one hand key card in the other jonathan hurriedly checks door numbers
we see room has the do not disturb sign on
jonathan arrives back at room
he pauses and slips his robe from his shoulder mock sexy
he puts the card key in the lock starts to open the door a small rectangular light blips red
he tries the card again
he knocks on the door calls out i cant get the card to work
he tries the card again
leaning in he thinks he hears something behind the door
he peers down at the key panel red
he knocks harder waits for a response
he jostles the door handle it wont budge
hes getting anxious now his breath quickening
he tries the key card again red
he pounds harder then slams his shoulder into the door
desperate he tries the key card again and the light turns green
a milliseconds surprised hesitation then he jerks the handle throws open the door and jonathan tumbles into he peers up into the small entryway empty
ahead of him we glimpse the foot of the bed its mussed blanket and sheets
jonathan gets to his feet starts for the bed his breath quickening as he now notices a few red specks on the blanket
panicked he rushes forward to find blood soaking the bed splattered all over the crumpled sheets
jonathan gapes horrified the world crashing in on him just as he senses something behind him and bang
something hits him to the back of the head he goes down like a sack of potatoes
the ice bucket on the floor
the ice has melted a pool of water seeps out
follow the flow to arrive at jonathans
slowly responding to the cold water
the tv playing a different film now
overhead of jonathan lies on the floor
he groans a little
rubs the back of his head
checks his hand for blood
pain etched in his face he manages to get to his feet shaky
he looks around the room
no sign of s
he runs into the bathroom
back in the room he tries the closets empty
the connecting door between this room and the next locked
he looks to where shed draped her clothes and bag every trace of her is gone
he whips back to the bed the sheets are still crumpled only theres no blood an here on them
he runs to the window looks down at the street
its four in the morning no one around
tripping over his own legs jonathan runs barefoot down the corridor
he rounds a corner another stretch of narrow corridor
we hear the muted ding of an elevator
jonathan tears off in its direction
he stumbles into the open square in which the elevators are located
he crushes the down button peers up to the floor indicator overhead slowly creeps to
his bare feet pounding the cement steps jonathan takes each floor faster sweat on his brow and his palms which slip their grasp on the railing he tumbles head first
crashing to the nd floor landing
he clutches his head gets up and continues to dash down
of the stairwells exit as jonathan stumbles out he lurches forward finally looking up to find hes in his undershirt tugged and misshapen boxers twisted around his bare thighs robe
open jonathan scans the lobby wild eyed and shaking
its utterly vacant at this hour the only sound a piped in muzak rendition of the beatles yesterday
the asian clerk working there snaps his head up with a startled gasp
jonathan barely manages to breathe the word help
two hotel security guards take the lead as they near room jonathan trailing breathless and shaken
i saw blood on the bed and then someone hit me
when i came to she was gone
this woman you were with
whats her name
jonathan looks blank his mind racing
i dont know
off their looks it starts with an s
was shea prostitute
no shes just a person
a friend with no name
of course she has a name
i just dont we have to find her something must have happened to her
the two security guards are eyeing the bed
i thought you said there was blood
i told you whoever did this must have cleaned it up while i was out
jonathan freezes eyes darting to the night stand
my wallet and keys theyre gone
they were right here
he looks over to the chair where his crumpled suit lies
his scarf is gone too
maybe she took them
she didnt do this okay
something happened to her
you dont understand we were
he sees something on the floor between the bed and night stand
he runs to to pick it up a chinese gum wrapper
this this was hers
jonathan clutches it desperately the lone trace of her existence
the guards exchange a look like hes insane
sir are these your clothes
jonathan nods absently
how about putting them on
jonathan arrives to find detective russo female mid s waiting by reception with a uniformed officer
seeing jonathan she sizes him up a moment then approaches him
messer im detective russo
still shaken jonathan sits in a wooden chair across from russo amidst the din and traffic of the precinct
and you dont know anything about her
where she works
where she lives
i told you how we met
through a sex group
her flat words hang in the air
he guiltily avoids her eyes
does this group have a name
i dont its not like that
messer i spoke to the desk clerk
she only recalled seeing you check in
thats the way it works
but now youre telling me that in addition to this mystery woman there was another individual in the room
not at first look i know how it sounds but im telling you whoever hit me must have i dont know taken her
he stops himself shuddering to think of the implications
messer have you had experiences like this before
taking any sort of medication
im not crazy okay
a woman vanished back there
there was blood all over the goddamn bed
he becomes very conscious that this sounds crazy when a cell phone rings its russos
she pauses struck by the genuine desperation in jonathans face
she finally picks up
glances at jonathan no i dont think its necessary
she hangs up and turns to jonathan
he looks away barely able to contain his devastation
what am i supposed to do
an awkward silence then if you want to file a report regarding the items she corrects herself the items you claim were stolen
jonathan shakes his head crushed and exasperated
id like to go now
is that all right
can i just can i go
jonathan climbs up to the landing fishes in the dark for a boot
he tips it a spare key falls out
as he starts back down he feels something in his coat pocket
he reaches in finds duck on bike where hed pocketed it
jonathan stands motionless beneath the shower face buried in his elbow completely overwhelmed by his loss and longing
jonathan enters wanders for his bed when he pauses staring at his dresser
he approaches peering down at something thats caught his eye
his high school tennis trophy
nothing unusual except for a small square outlined in dust three inches from the trophy base the wood around its perimeter far more faded than the exposed area as if
the trophy had recently been moved
jonathan swallows tensely staring at the cryptic dust mark sound advance bang
of a file cabinet drawer yanked open in
used for storage including an old gun metal grey filing cabinet
phone to his ear jonathan rapidly sifts through faded file folders crammed with papers and documents
your ad says hour locksmith
well how soon could you
he opens a file its where he keeps his passport
he stuffs it in his back pocket keeps searching pulls a folder marked credit cards
sorting through old statements he finds the line to report a card lost or stolen
close on jonathans haggard face in the mirror of a medicine cabinet as he pulls it open
be fishes around finds what hes looking for a small black cannister for film
he pops the cap to reveal a fat roll of emergency money
jonathan exits the bathroom crosses the living room to the foyer where we find a locksmith finishing changing the lock
jonathan lies awake staring at his muted tv his face tear stained his eyes clouded
this is jonathan messer
i wont be able to come in today
im pretty ill
duck on bike sits on his nightstand next to his glasses
jonathan seated resting against the window drifting off into
we move in tighter on his face tighter next stop canal street
canal is next
jonathan jerks awake
a few stares from nearby passengers
jonathan emerges from underground to hectic chinatown
what once felt romantic now feels cold and exclusionary a bustling mix of asians and map clutching tourists
he surveys the area overwhelmed eyes searching for anything resembling a clue
foreign faces return only cold blank stares
jonathan pauses by a street vendor takes from his pocket the gum wrapper he found in the hotel shows it to the vendor
cramped and dingy
jonathan makes his way to the counter where an old woman sits smoking
he holds up the wrapper
i was told you sell this gum here
the old woman studies him a wary beat then gestures to a candy display
in one box is the same gum
a woman a white woman buys this brand of gum
i need to find the old woman interrupts him in raspy chinese
im sorry i dont do you know the woman im talking about
a white woman
please its very important that i my grandmother doesnt speak english
jonathan spins around to find a chinese girl
in a smock
can you ask if she knows the name of the white woman who buys this gum
the girl questions the old woman in rapid chinese
a dragon her smoke then gives a lengthy answer
the girl nods finally turns to an anxiously waiting jonathan
she says they sell that gum in practically every store in chinatown
jonathan is struggling with his stiff new key hearing his phone ringing inside
jonathan rushes for the phone picks up
creepy and drab
jonathan enters approaches a receptionist
the receptionist nods points across the lobby to detective russo
jonathan looks very worried
the elevator descends with an unnerving rattle as jonathan rides down with russo
the body came in late last night although time of deaths still unclear
she was found in a taxi driver was in a
coffee shop on his break came back to his cab and there she was in the back seat
the elevator shudders to a metallic stop
her purse was recovered from a dumpster about a block away so weve got a name
jonathan tenses as the elevator doors bang open
jonathan looks sick with fear
russo leads jonathan into the harsh fluorescent lights of the morgue
a medical examiner s looks up from a deli sandwich takes one last bite and waves them over
as they approach jonathan notices the two uniformed officers stationed down here
they recognize russo nod in recognition and eye jonathan with hard careful stares
stands over agurney casually lifts the sheet thats been draped over the body
we glimpse a slender foot
close on jonathan beside russo
he turns instantly pale lip quivering as he stares in disbelief our camera slowly coming over his shoulder to get a look at the victims face its not s
but we do recognize her
its the blonde the first woman hed been with the one hed passed without a word in an office some days later
she looks the same only death pale and naked and her neck marred by a thin discolored line where shes been strangled
he tries to speak but can hardly breathe let alone answer
was this the woman you were with last night
she frowns suspicious of jonathans hesitation
his tense eyes whip across the morgue the two cops still idling there
theyre out of earshot but their mere presence amps tension
angle on the guns in their holsters
the handcuffs dangling mr
no shes not
not last night
russo studies his strained expression a suspicious beat
jonathan exits behind russo as they step onto the sidewalk
i figured it was a long shot
the only reason i called you down is she was last seen with a man in the bar of the hudson hotel
suddenly tenses the hudson
you mentioned this group of yours meets up at various hotels
i thought it was worth a shot
russo glances up at him trying to read him something about his reaction not sitting right with her
messer is there anything else you want to tell me
nervous and torn jonathan manages to shake his head
jonathan exiting the morgue talking low into his cell phone
wyatt its me
i need to talk to you
call me ok
a pleasant receptionist smiles up from her expansive desk
may i help you
jonathan is standing across from her
yes i need to get in contact with one of your attorneys wyatt bose its extremely important
hes working out of the london office right now
if i could speak to his assistant or someone whod know how to reach him immediately
just a minute
the receptionist types into her phone system
she shakes her head confused
b o s e

wyatt with a y
angle on a middle aged woman walking past
pomerantz works in h

jonathan walks alongside ms

yes yes im he works here
ive seen him working here

he hands her wyatts business card with the rutherford stern masthead on it
she studies it with a look of confusion
i dont know whats going on but i can assure you there is nobody here named ive seen him in the halls for chrissake we smoked pot in the conference
pomerantz abruptly frowns when jonathan spots a lawyer this lawyer and another laughing at wyatts punch line
jonathan runs over to the lawyer grabs the mans arm
look im trying to find wyatt
i saw you talking with him cracking jokes in the coffee lounge
flash on same scene wyatt looks up eyes meet jonathans
jonathan smiles in greeting
but wyatt just nods coolly
i crack jokes with a lot of people
hold on youre telling me you dont hey easy with the hands okay
jonathan realizes hes got the mans sleeve in his fist
he lets go spins back to ms
he said he was in london with mr
rutherford paperinga mister messer
jonathan spins to find ms
pomerantz scowling at him
rutherford is presently recovering from hip surgery
in new jersey
jonathan glances around to find everyone lawyers assistants mail clerks all staring at him
breathless jonathan bolts up a set of stairs knocks on a door
he knocks harder
from within we hear a set of footsteps
sound of a lock turning the door is opened
wyatt by a man in his early s his wife behind him both strike us as wealthy downtown patron of the arts types
sorry i i need to speak to wyatt
excuse me wyatt
he lives here
in this building
he must be new
see weve been out of town the past months not in this building in this apartment
young man weve owned this apartment going on thirty years now
i was right here with him
the man takes a step back catching his wifes equally wary expression his hand making for the chain lock
that painting there its a gerhard richter right
even more uneasy yes
from a gallery
in munich the one that herr kleiner handles
the art dealer downstairs
you must mean mr
moretti but hes in the carpet business but wyatt smoke to him
unless it was in italian i doubt he got very far
jonathan steps back looking like hes losing his mind
are you all right
jonathan stumbles out breathing hard as he tries to grapple with this when he slams up against a mans shirtfront
two hands grasp his arms we glimpse a pair of black wingtips and whip tilt up to the papery face of herr kleiner aka mr
jonathan sits slumped against a window the world around him is ceasing to make sense
across the aisle a young bohemian couple sit side by side her headon his shoulder
on jonathans face theres a sense of loss that is almost overwhelming
jonathan takes the crinkled chinese gum wrapper from his pocket smoothes it in his hands stares down at it with a look of longing
when his eyes suddenly widen
he sees something inside something he hadnt noticed
he unfolds it to reveal two words written in a feminine hand on the white underside im sorry jonathan quickly looks up as if expecting someone else to share in
this haunting discovery
of course no one does
he stares back
down at it bewildered stunned chilled
jonathan runs out from the subway station
determined he walks down canal street his eyes suddenly land on a copy shop across
tight on jonathan as we see something click in his head jonathan steps off the elevator heads straight for the receptionist
she immediately looks nervous
sir we asked around nobody knows the guy when i was working over here you made a photocopy of my i
we do all freelancers its policy
oh im not sure im allowed to you have to
she looks at him sees his desperation
jonathan is flipping through the stack of photocopies then halts on one
he stares at it
the receptionist peers over
he was real cute
only he wasnt a lawyer
he was a systems analyst i think
he was here for a few days to work on the computers
receptionists pov of the photocopy in jonathans hand
its of a massachusetts drivers license
staring back up at us is wyatts smiling face
i thought you said his name was wyatt
pan to the name beside the photo sansky
jonathan is already running for the exit
close on jonathans laptop screen as an internet search engine runs the name bansky william
a page of some matches is returned
jonathan readies himself then dives in
beside the keyboard rests the receptionists photocopy of william banskys massachusetts drivers license
we see detective russos business card resting a few inches away
checking urls site by site
he finally pauses on one
its an article from the boston herald
the headline police have few clues to young executives disappearance
as jonathan scans the article we glimpse some lines of text
looking for william roger bansky age
was employed on a freelance basis by an on site software consulting firm in boston
bansky recently relocated from the chicago area
a number of bad checks
debts a young man on the run
tilt up to jonathan scribbling on a post it pad he sticks the post it to the photocopy of banskys id
he steps back stares at it a beat when he notices something on his desk resting under the phone a manila file folder
he frowns at it clearly out of place here
he picks the file up opens it
to a series of x photographs
heart racing nervously he takes one out its of jonathan standing in the plaza lobby by the eloise portrait
confused he quickly flips to the next one in it a blonde now stands there with him the blonde found murdered
jonathans rapidly breathing as he shuffles through more photos
theyre in sequence taken by telephoto lens
jonathan and simone forester getting in the elevator
opening the room door
in one jonathan has his hands on her neck
hes sweating with anxiety when suddenly the phone rings startling him
he eyes it warily then slowly picks up
messer its detective russo returning your call
jonathan freezes tries not to sound panicked his eyes fixed on the damning photos of himself and simone forester
oh right i was just checking in to see if you had any leads
on that missing girl of yours
no not yet
anxious to hang up oh okay thanks are you sure you didnt know simone forester
the photos of simone in his hands jonathan tenses
i told you before i remember what you said
an unsettling silence and you werent at the hudson two nights ago
i dont why are you turns out among credit card charges made that night there was one with your name
the card was declined
i cancelled them all the day they got stolen
i figured it didnt mean much cards move quickly
it just struck me you know
jonathan can hear the suspicion in her pause
by the way the morgue confirmed strangulation as cause of death
he found trace fibres of kevlar in her neck wound
its used in certain kinds of rope and string
jonathans eyes suddenly go wide whip pan with his gaze to the hall closet door
yes yes im thought i lost you for a second
well i wont keep you
you have a good night
jonathan slowly hangs up his panicked gaze returning to the hall closet as he paces toward it throws open the door
in the far corner rests his racket bag
he grabs it yanks open the zipper
his face draining of all remaining color as he peers into his empty racket ba
his racket is gone
jonathan pacing the floor paranoid
he holds detective russos card
knows he should call back
he abruptly reaches for the phone and dials
i know okay
i know your name isnt wyatt bose
i know you killed that woman
and i know youre trying to frame me for it so so why
what the hell is going on
and where is she
if you hurt her i swear to god ill
jonathan falters unsure where hes going with this and realizing hes now talking to himself
simply hang up
to erase and record a new messa ge press star
jonathan hesitates hits the star key
a new beep
harder its me
i need to talk to you
he hits pound
at least hes done something
suddenly from o
a faint creak
jonathan spins scans the room grabs the nearest blunt object his tennis trophy
quickly cut shots of jonathan searching his apartment his trophy raised as a makeshift weapon
he finally halts uneasy but satisfied theres no one else here when his home phone rings startling him
his machine picks up this is jonathan
please leave a message
a moment of hiss then jonathan
jonathan whips to the phone it sounds like wyatt chet peterson calling only its not
i understand you were out today
i left messages on your cell but never heard back so i thought id try you at home
he slowly lowers his trophy as he listens staring out the window at the dark night and empty street below
just want to make sure youre up to speed with weiss murphy because the folks at clute nichols are expecting you
jonathan sits in a crowded car dressed for work
theyre our biggest client so needless to say make them your top priority
jonathan takes out the crinkled chinese gum wrapper
he stares at it with a look of longing this is his priority a series of shots jonathan asking around about s
the street vendors
the receptionist at the hotel
the waiter at the restaurant where they ate
they all shake their heads
heading back for the subway dejected he steps on
a discarded page from the newspapers metro section sees a headline still no suspect in murder of young exec
the photo is of simone forester
intensely preoccupied jonathan walks alone past assistants and execs
in his eyes a sense of paranoia a mistrust of every strange face
isolated behind yet another wall of glass jonathan just stares bleary eyed at his laptop unable to work
jonathan exits starts toward the sidewalk but hears something sandpaper shuffle of shoes on pavement
be spins no one there
just one of many large stone pillars adorning the building
jonathan peers anxiously at the pillar wavering
he steps closer trying to glimpse behind it ring
of his cell phone breaks the stillness
he catches his breath quickly picks up
a silent beat
are you free tonight
he hangs up chilled
turns again to the pillar steps closer no sound
then turns and walks off
people heading home from work
jonathan among them utterly desolate
sliding his metrocard he suddenly feels watched again
he spins peers anxiously behind him
only strange faces passing through turnstiles
a narrow curved stretch of grimy walls of ads and graffiti
jonathan keeps a quick pace feeling vulnerable
we lag back following him from an anonymous pov glance up at a sign for stairs to the n r trains
jonathan is waiting for his train eyes nervously glancing around still feeling watched when he sees a young woman standing all the way across on the opposite platform waiting for
she casually turns her head and jonathans eyes go wide
jonathan just gapes across the divide of two subway tracks he cant believe hes seeing her again
when she starts to back away almost as if she might run
confused jonathan rushes to the edge of his platform
wait right there
jonathan stands on the edge reeling desperate to get to her
he looks around hears the distant
nimble of afar
off train and suddenly he does something wed have never thought him capable of he jumps onto the tracks
he lands hard nearly breaking his ankle but quickly scrambles to his feet splashing in the sludge between rails eyes darting along the track anxious to avoid the third rail
ears attuned to the sound of that distant train as he races for he reaches the grimy rungs and quickly climbs up
he gets to his feet on the center divider now only one lane of track separating him from the platform she was standing on only shes no longer there
he scans the people waiting no sign of s among them and then suddenly he spots her heading for the exits
she glances back utterly stunned to find jonathan standing on the center divider feet soaked in muck
neither speaks for a moment just staring at each other across the solitary track
then i thought you were dead
she looks like she wants to say something but doesnt
and all at once hes hit with a crushing realization you are in on this arent you
she holds his eyes a moment longer fighting back emotion then she abruptly turns and starts back for the exit again
how do you know him
off her silence damn it answer me
she halts slowly looks back at him
of camaz through the club
he caught me trying to steal his wallet
jonathan looks confused shes struggling to stay composed but looks like she could break down at any moment
azsaz he asked if i wanted to make some real money
all i had to do was get involved with you and not ask any questions
jonathan just stares devastated
so everything between us was nothing
she fights back tears
after that first night i tried to call it off he said hed kill me if i didnt go through with it
go through with what
get you out of the hotel room slip out and meet up later for my money
only i ran instead
hes been looking for me ever since
i have to leave the city then why didnt you
because i needed to see you again
i needed to be sure you were all right
despite his conflicting emotions jonathan is moved by this
s f i didnt know how to find you you were just a number in a cell phone and
is cont d jonathan had taken that
i remembered you took this train wait jonathan
we hear the approaching roar of an incoming train
ii s f did you go to the police
hes framing me for murder
he killed a woman from the club someone id been with
s is shocked
clearly she had no idea
i s f jonathan you have to leave
do you understand
you need to get the hell out of here hes going to kill you
the roar of the incoming train is growing louder
dont you understand
hes going to kill when the incoming train completely drowns him out
and swipes s out of jonathans view
jonathan struggles to peer through the train windows but its passengers prevent him from getting a look at her
just then the train doors open with the noise of passengers getting on and off
panicked jonathan cranes his neck trying to see her through the windows
he boards the train using it as a bridge he pushes through passengers desperate for an open door to the other side
shuttle to new yorks grand central station
grand central is next
he jumps off the train in the direction shed been walking only shes nowhere in sight
jonathan spins frantically as the doors close and he hears the train start to pull away
he runs alongside the train desperately searching for a glimpse of her no sign of her in any of the windows
until the last car passes and there she is standing at the rear observation window her hand pressed to the pane her tearful expression bidding him a heartbreaking goodbye
he stumbles to a devastated halt eyes pleading vainly as he watches her recede framed by the rectangle of window directly beneath it the trains steel
exterior labelled the shuttle lines circled black and white s
tilt down from the constellations of the vaulted ceiling to the tiny figure of s standing at the ticket counter staring uneasily through bars at a ticket agent
lets see theres one to new haven leaving in
if you need to go farther you can transfer from there
s peers anxiously around her like someone hunted
and thats the very next train leaving
only a few scattered travellers this late
s slumps into a seat takes a breath and starts to quietly break down
she shuts her eyes tries to stifle her sobbing
a mans hand extends a handkerchief from the seat behind her
azsaz no thank you
rack focus on the man withdrawing his handkerchief behind her grinning coolly to himself its wyatt
rack back to s as her eyes blink open in terror jonathan yanks open his mailbox
as he heads upstairs theres a change in his face a newly forged determination
he takes out his cell phone dials
the other end immediately picks up jonathan messera jonathan hangs up
takes an angry breath
he hangs up again
but his face bears a blank eerily driven expression
he hits redial again as he opens the door to jonathan enters phone still to his ear
jonathan hangs up and just stares at the phone in his hand on the verge of something like a scream
he takes a breath
presses redial once more
only now it rings
ring a click of someone picking up then silence and faint wisps of static
not a word from the other end
we barely make out breathing
is that you
jonathan takes a tentative step forward as if fearful that the least movement will cost him this connection
say something damn it
from the receiver we hear a well exhaled breath
and then sung in a low whisper yesterday
reeling jonathan grips the phone tighter to his ear
all my troubles seemed so far away
what do you want from me
now it seems as though answer me
theyre here to stay oh i believe why are you doing this to me
in yester im going to find you you hear me
jonathan slams the phone down tension in his face joined by a new emotion something closer to
im going to find you
jonathan is heading for the clute nichols building that same focused tension on his face mr
jonathan is too lost in thought to hear it
he glances up
to find russo standing near the entryway whats she doing here
he has no choice but to meet her
i was gonna call but i was in the area
just doing some follow up
jonathan tries to mask his uneasiness
on that missing girl of yours
one whose name began with
have any luck finding her
jonathan absently tightens his grasp on his briefcase
thats too bad
she studies him a cryptic beat then smiles flatly
well who knows maybe shell turn up yet
you have a good day mr
jonathan nods tensely then walks off feeling her watching him from the curb as he goes
employees pass by the glass behind which we see jonathan a lone figure at his laptop surrounded by files and post its
close on jonathan as he scribbles on a post it yesterday beatles
widen to find the post its organized with his usual fastidiousness only scribbled with words not numbers wyatt bose william bansky and other random scribblings
hes trying to apply his mathematical mind to his crisis hoping to conjure some kind of pattern or logic to it all
reverse angle through the glass to anyone passing he looks like your typical overly meticulous isolated auditor
closer on jonathan as he clutches the table looks seconds away from utterly losing it when something suddenly occurs to him
he whips around gaze fixing on his cell phone
he grabs it
presses a key repeatedly scanning then hits send
jonathan brings the phone to his ear listens for the other end then are you free tonight
jonathan waits anxiously by a botero sculpture of a rotund dog
a young woman in a blue pashmina approaches
blue pashmina enters first jonathan follows her into an empty elevator
the doors close
do you know wyatt bose
immediately guarded excuse me
what about william bansky
does that name she darts
for the door open button but he blocks her path
i swear to god ill scream
please im not trying to scare you i just im looking for someone
and its very important that i find him
she tries to push past him again jonathan blocks her
he does this too or he did
someone had to give him the numbers
someone let him in
if i can find who it was that knew him they might know where hes she suddenly kicks him in the shin with a spiked heel
jonathan grasps his leg she presses the button and is out the opening doors before hes even looked up
sound advance tense clacking of computer keys
close on jonathan alone at the end of the conference table eyes scanning files absently fingers typing on auto pilot
his gaze holds a new determination as the clacking of keys jonathan anxiously escorts another young woman past the quasi moroccan motif
asking her something he takes out a folded paper from his pocket shows it to her its the photocopy of banskys license with the image of wyatts face
she quickly shakes her head her eyes searching for the exit
jonathan trails a tall woman as she bee lines for the exit
he grabs her arm thrusts the photocopy into her hands
she halts looks up at him
and tears it in two before handing it back and hurrying off her glare full of paranoia
jonathan rises from a couch to greet yet another young woman
he gets no more than a few seconds into his question when she about faces without a word
jonathan has a relentless look in his eye
takes out his cell calls another number
rapid jump cuts of a dozen different womens faces all indicating twenty different kinds of no with each cut the women occupy the exact same position in frame only their
faces and the hotel backgrounds behind them change
room key in hand jonathan rides up with a woman in a black business suit a tall attractive business type
jonathan stares at his shoes trying to mask his
jonathan and black business suit come in
she starts to i need to ask you something its incredibly important
he pauses to unfold his now scotch taped photocopy shows it to her
she freezes eyes fixed on the license photo
jonathan braces himself for her departure when she stares back up at him in scared but clear recognition
seated on the edge of the made bed black business suit shifts uncomfortably as she lights a cigarette
i was in chicago on business a little over a year ago
i was out
to dinner with one of our chicago partners
a man named holloway
thats how i met him
tight on jonathan as we smash to a slightly older man holloway sits with his back to us
across from him sits black business suit
a younger man steps into frame rests his hand on holloways shoulder
at first i assumed he was a junior executive at their firm
but he wasnt
thats not to say he didnt work for holloway but clearly in a more intimate capacity
black business suit takes a cool drag on her cigarette
i wasnt shocked
besides obviously im no prude
even back then id been doing you know this thing for a while
wyatt is talking entertaining his two companions but clearly more focused on black business suit flirting it up
i was simply curious
more so when he apologized explaining that hed forgotten about another engagement
wyatts knuckles just barely stroke black business suits thigh as he rises to leave
they exchange a knowing glance
i was intrigued
he was intelligent informed about everything from law to art to politics
id never met anyone so in command of his own charm
he said that hed come from nothing that everything he learned he learned from his tricks
he claimed that holloway was even grooming him for a position at his company
she lights another cigarette with her old one
in a way i felt for him
but i also admired him
it sounds silly
but he had a way of making me feel close to him you know
this clearly hits home with jonathan
he barely nods
so i found myself telling him things
and next thing i knew you told him
a beat and she nods crushing out her other cigarette
he seemed fascinated by it
wanted to know all the details
i suppose id had too much to drink
and i was distracted
i was thinking about what a great lay he was going to be
wyatt and black business suit go at it with animal aggression
shes on all fours arching lustily pleasure nearly unbearable eyes clenched shut as she climaxes
exhausted her body goes limp
tilt up to his face an eerily blank driven stare devoid of real pleasure
she struggles tries to protest when his hands grip her shoulder blades thrusting harder violently pinning her down her sudden fear stifled by the mattress close on black business suit
staring off chilled by memory
only afterwards i discovered two of my credit cards were missing
as was my cell phone
of course i couldnt say anything to holloway
and jamie must have known id never report it to the police
so i just put the incident out of my mind
i all but forgot about it until one night maybe two months ago black business suit is crossing the lobby for a portrait of hearst and a suited man lingering
when the man looks up
i almost didnt recognize him
but when i did i suddenly felt very very scared
she freezes obscured by one of the trees as wyatt checks his watch scans the lobby with a cool piercing look
i left before he saw me
she drags on her cigarette looks off into space
he must have used my cell phone to get into the group
crushes out her cigarette anyway thats it
thats all i know
she looks around
at the room the bed
she shudders rises
wait thank you
off her look have you ever run into him again
and i dont ever want to
that was his name
bundled in her ski jacket solange is closing up her shop for the night stacks of flowers in her arms when she notices jonathan coming down the front steps
jonathan youre home early only when he looks up she finds the young man in the overcoat isnt jonathan
oh je suis desole
wyatt flashes her an icy smile continues down the steps
solange watches him walk away a puzzled look on her face
huddled over a computer jonathan typing eyes red from exhaustion and stress as we hear his recall whos james getz
a guy i roomed with freshman year at princeton
on jonathans monitor we see hes on a web site for princeton university alumni
he types in getz james
a beat then no match
a long list of g names follows
jonathan scrolls down the list but theres no getz
jonathan exhales about to log off when a name among the hs jumps out at him holloway
jonathan stares at it tensely then clicks on the name
sort no contact information available
jonathan thinks a moment then tries a search engine types holloway reed then decides to add the word missing
an article appears
from the chicago tribune body of missing businessman finally discovered
a head shot style photograph shows a man in his early s whom we recognize from black business suits story
beneath his photo his name reed holloway
jonathan glances up at the hotel employee manning the desk
can i print this out
porn shops and prostitutes the streets pulsing with a sinister energy
jonathan is pacing toward the subway reading over the printed article
jonathan descends the steps to his presently deserted neighborhood
the departure of the subway train is joined by the distant
wail of sirens
jonathan continues down the block then pauses
he wrinkles his nose smelling something
he looks up two blocks away a thick plume of smoke is billowing up into the sky jonathan bolts around the corner to find an ambulance and fire engine curbside
a fire raging in the lower story of his building
running toward the blaze he speeds past a black bmw parked across the street engine running
it suddenly shifts into gear and peels out in a fast turn
jonathan spins something about it troubling him but the bmw is already gone
he continues racing toward his building
the neon fleurs de solange sign crackles and sparks in the flame
through blown out windows piles of burning flowers emit what must be an awful stench
two ems workers are loading a gurney on which solange lays burned and half aware but alive when jonathan rushes over
she manages to open her eyes her voice barely audible jonathan
he squeezes her hand as shes lifted into the ambulance
to ems worker is she going to be okay
yeah shell make it
the ambulance doors slam shut
a hand grabs jonathans arm
he spins its a fire worker
i live here
thick smoke clouds the stairs and corridor
suit jacket over his head jonathan is hurriedly escorted by the fire worker
his own door has already been kicked open splintered at its hinges
the place looks like its been turned upside down furniture soaking wet charred areas on walls
lucky we were able to contain it somewhat
better get your valuables together
still in shock he tosses random clothes in a gym bag duck on bike too
calls out how did it start
were not sure
maybe a bad fuse
jonathan opens his medicine cabinet takes out his small film cannister uncaps it to see how much money he has left
not very much
he stuffs the cannister into his pants pocket
jonathan opens his old gunmetal gray filing cabinet then pops open his briefcase trying to decide what to take
he finds a file marked bank statements pulls it about to toss it in his briefcase when he stops something about its contents close on the file
stuffed with paper
but not bank statements
copies and copies of photographs of jonathan with simone forester
some weve seen some new
jonathan hunts through more files his breathless nausea telling us the contents of each and every file have been swapped out with photos
he opens another at random and freezes its a photo of jonathan and s walking in chinatown
he scans through others shots of them in the restaurant entering the hotel lotus
tight on jonathan terrified by the horrific implication mr
jonathan gasps as he looks up to find the fire worker in the doorway
he quickly shuts the file
just give me a minute
a paranoid looking jonathan returns with a briefcase stuffed near to bursting
the tired fire worker looks up impatiently
jonathan regards his minimal possessions realizes how little evidence there is of a life
a wrenching sense of isolation
i guess it is
you got someone you can stay with
the sort of decrepit no tell motel frequented by hookers and junkies
jonathan clutches his briefcase as he stares through steel mesh at
the night clerk
its fifty for the night
jonathan fishes out his film cannister and parts with what he discovers are his last three s
even more depressing than the lobby bars on the windows stains on the thin walls through which the faint sounds of paid sex bleed in
somewhere a bottle smashes
unable to sleep jonathan has emptied his briefcase contents onto the bed
he stares at one of wyatts photos of him and s
shes smiling up at him
extreme close on the image of her face
the smile frozen in time at once haunting and heartbreaking
he gently sets the photo down beside the chicago tribune article hed printed on the unsolved murder of reed holloway body of missing businessman finally discovered
his eyes drift to the article and something suddenly occurs to him flash on the photograph in wyatts
brownstone of wyatt with bleached hair styled in a loose spike in the articles photo holloway sports an almost identical look
his eyes move to the date of the article may
jonathan on the phone a business card in hand
boston police how can i direct your call
jonathan reads off the card detective russo had given him this is detective russo nypd badge number
just need some information from you guys
jonathan sits in suspense awaiting a response
youve got a case a missing person named william bansky
im wondering if you can tell me the date he was last seen
hold a sec
bansky william last seen
jonathans eyes return to the holloway article body of missing businessman finally discovered dated may
anything else you thats it thanks
jonathan quickly hangs up equally encouraged and chilled by the connection hes made
tilt down to a post it on which hes scribbled bose bansky holloway
to this he adds james getz a line of customers stare mutely up at plasma tv screens above except for jonathan unshaven suit wrinkled face all anxious tension
jonathan slides his passport through the windows metal tray to the teller s working behind three inches of glass
the teller examines the passport then slides it back
mkay if youll just swipe your atm card
she gestures to a small punch pad to jonathans right
actually my card was stolen

the thing is i already used your automated system and

jonathans cool is cracking
the teller wrinkles her brow
mmkay if you press on either phone

hands of a guy about whom everything i know is apparently a lie
ive had my building set on fire my neighbor nearly killed and my apartment ransacked

the stunned teller stares back at him slack jawed
look i know im just another face on this side of the glass i get that
but im begging you as one human being to another please let me into your life just long enough to help me out here
the teller stares back at him a beat and nods
she starts quickly typing into her monitor finally looks up
im showing that card as having been sent out four days ago
it definitely went out
we even heeded the change of address request
well like i wait what request
apparently you informed the bank of an address change
she swivels her monitor so he can see
jonathan messer e
st street as seen from the convex mirror of an atm machine we watch from an anonymous pov jonathan racing out of the bank
jonathan rounds the corner at a jog checking awning numbers finally halts on one e
we recognize the doorman in the midst of fielding a complaint by an elderly tenant with a yappy dog
jonathan hurries to the elevators unnoticed
jonathan emerges from an elevator
the last door on the left
jonathan tries the doorknob
jonathan checks under the mat
sure enough theres a key
empty walls expensive views polished wood floors
jonathan takes a wary step inside leaning to peer around the corners
he paces cautiously through the living room
the dining area
the glistening chrome and granite kitchen
a room as empty as the others with the exception of a small pile of envelopes beneath a window in a far corner
jonathan slowly nears
to find its a stack of mail
he picks up an envelope o
the creak of a door hinge
jonathan whips around no one behind him
he steps out of the room to investigate
we remain alone in the empty room an excruciating beat
until jonathan finally steps back in only slightly at ease
he returns to the stack of mail picks up an envelope
he reads mr
jonathan messer e
eyes wide he hurriedly flips through the rest of the mail all addressed to him at this address
jonathan still staring at this mail in disbelief when he finds at the bottom of the stack another photograph
its of s standing fearfully on the subwa latform across the track from jonathan
and suddenly jonathan is gripped with fear unaware of a blurred nearing intruder
long time no see
jonathan spins round wyatts standing there with a gun
its pointing directly at jonathan
i have some instructions
follow them and i might let her live
where is she
this shouldve been simpler
i frame you you panic
where is she
a terrifying silence jonathan erupts goddamn it tell me what you did to press pause on the questions and listen
the brokerage firm youre auditing is clute nichols
as a standard part of that audit youre temporarily privy to all client accounts as well as access codes required for transactions
tonight youre going to skim from those accounts a total of million and transfer that money to an account ive established overseas
i cant i have no idea how to even i know you dont
but i do
brandishes the gun now please
jonathan takes it out and tosses it to him
wyatt catches it
and hands jonathan an envelope
its all in there
their banks will just be opening
it wont work they screen for stuff like this
itll be discovered eventually
i can live with eventually
i always have
this account overseas its in my name isnt it
a moment of tense silence
jonathan just stares back hard a quiet beat then whyd you pick me
wyatt raises a brow vaguely amused the question
you answered the ad jonathan
off jonathans confusion feeling all alone out there
have a great job fine personality and good looks to match but no time to
meet that special someone
help is just a phone call away the ad in money magazine
told you to block that caller id
of course i had to scope out a whole lot of losers before i hit the jackpot
after all there only so many jonathan messers out there
if you screw with me well you saw what i did to that blonde
thats kindness compared to what ill do to your little girlfriend
you wont even recognize her when im through
why should i believe you
everything you told me was lies
not lies jonathan
now youre fucked
he grins his charming grin and starts for the door
remember be smart
ill be watching you
feel free to take a shower looks like you could do with one
the front door slams
jonathan just stands there staring shell shocked at the envelope
jonathan comes out the building putting the envelope in his suit pocket
as he crosses the street a car horn blares whip around to find a car barrelling at us
jonathan dives out of the way an instant before the car would have hit him
face first in the gutter scraped and gasping jonathan peers up to see wyatts black bmw speeding away
a stiff guy in his late s is working in his office when an assistant enters
peterson one of the audit managers is here to see you
well okay bring him back
we follow the assistant out the door read the name stencilled on the glass chet peterson senior manager
through a set of frosted glass doors we see petersons assistant approach a receptionist who gestures across the lobby
the assistant approaches the sofas where jonathan is seated
she addresses him
chet peterson looks up as his door is opened jonathan good to see you again
reverse angle to find a young man weve never seen before
actually i was just looking for fred whipples office
next door down
the young man ducks out and now peterson sees his assistant approaching jonathan a few paces behind her adjusting his glasses
peterson reloads his greeting jonathan good to see you again
close on chet peterson gravely peering across his desk
well i have to say your resignation comes as something of a surprise
most of our auditors seem to like the freedom the position affords
youll stay on to finish up at clute nichols of course
track around peterson to see jonathan seated across from him lifting his head to reply and doing so revealing its wyatt wearing one of jonathans suits hair colored and styled
like jonathans even sporting identical eyeglasses
he offers an awkward half smile just as jonathan would
so do you have any plans
im going to travel
i want to see the world
peterson nods benignly
jonathan sitting in the conference room of clute nichols lettered boxed by the glass wall through which he watches employees pass in fewer and fewer numbers
throughout this jonathans blank stare of harrowed tension never changes
abeautiful shot of the cityscape accompanied by the sound of fingers clacking on keys
jonathan seated at the far end of the empty table typing on his laptop
beside him is the envelope wyatt gave him and its sheet of paper on which instructions are typed
jonathan peers at the laptop clock
it reads pm
his eyes travel in a tense triangle from instructions to laptop screen to glass wall fingers typing all the while
he finally reaches a prompt bienvenue
pour anglais cboisez p
we glimpse a small
logo with a swiss flag
jonathan presses f
reads some more types some more
finally we read enter sub account number
jonathan enters more per wyatts typed instructions
jonathan copies the numbers in from the instructions
his eyes travel to a page atop a clute nichols file
we can glimpse an digit code circled in pencil
jonathan stares at the cursor
on the laptop screen the icon blinking petulantly
hes about to type
and then he halts
his eyes drifting to his cell phone resting in its charger
tighter on jonathan
his eyes fixed on the cell phone an idea forming in his mind ring
of the cell phone suddenly jars us
jonathan hesitates then picks up
whats taking you
jonathan says nothing
we can hear wyatt getting tenser i said whats taking you
i wondered if you were monitoring this
dont worry about what im doing
just finish the transaction
not until i see her
off wyatts silence the transfers impossible without an access code
and theres no way im entering it until im sure that shes safe
so you tell me
how do we do that
wyatt still remains unnervingly silent
we tighten on jonathan holding his breath any plan hes concocting clearly hinging on this
low frustrated you have a wireless connection
jonathan lets out a brief exhalation
jonathan snaps his laptop lid shut packs it in his gym bag in which we glimpse the photo hes kept with him of s smiling up at him
he then turns to his cell phone once more
he picks it up scrolls the menu punches a number
are you free tonight
a sudden jarring sound advance of music as we
an elaborate and intensely packed wedding party is being held up here beneath the glow of heat lamps the music and crowd noise unspeakably loud
we travel through the din past hundreds of well heeled partiers mainly young and wealthy
the party noise is even slightly audible stories below where we find jonathan carrying his bag as he enters
jonathan surveys the busy lobby
and of course the eloise portrait
may i ask you a personal question
jonathan spins around stares frostily into wyatts magnetic smile
with wyatts new look they could be brothers
except wyatt looks clean and crisp jonathan dishevelled and tense
wyatt eyes the bag in jonathans hand
where is she
in one of the rooms
a thin smile i got us a table
a waitress delivers a pair of drinks to where jonathan and wyatt are seated
two macallan year
the waitress leaves
wyatt raises his glass
jonathan just stares back at wyatt
banskys dead isnt he
he was dead when i met him
just like you
the rest was a mere formality
re the laptop of course he didnt have your bargaining chip
speaking of which
not until i see her
shes the only reason im here and not at the police
i told you shes in a room
give me the key then
wyatt considers this then takes out an electronic key card and slides it across the table
of course theres nothing on the key card to indicate a room number
as soon as youre done ill tell you the room number
not good enough
wyatt reaches for the key card as he does we glimpse a handgun concealed by his suit
you wont let her live
you killed all the others youll have to kill us too
hey i like you okay
youll be fine
scoffs repulsed you like me
i do jonathan
in my way
after all youre my creation
im the one who gave you life
dont you get it
it was her not you
shes the one
she gave me life
you can steal my identity but not whats here
he puts his hand on his heart
wyatt is startled by jonathans passionate outburst
yeah well im weeping big wet ones for you both
now lets get on with it
i dont have all night jonathan
jonathan reluctantly nods his assent
wyatt lets go of the key card
jonathan opens his bag
close on jonathans laptop screen as it defuzzes from sleep
the screen as it was cursor blinking by the request for an access code
wyatt watches intensely as jonathan starts to type then pauses looking confused
jonathan quickly reaches around
to the back of his laptop feels an empty jack and suddenly turns pale
what is it
my wireless modem i must have left it in the conference room
i cant get back online
wyatt glares at jonathan seething
you stupid fuck
i can go back there and no
thinks then abruptly get up
wyatt and jonathan crossing the lobby they arrive at hotel guest business center partitioned by a wall of glass
jonathan and wyatt stand on the other side peering in
they dont let you use your own computer
wyatt takes out a hundred dollar bill gives it to jonathan
they will now
jonathan takes the hundred and heads into empty at this hour with the exception of a sleepy looking employee
as jonathan steps toward the desk he takes out the hotel key card his eyes travelling up to a clock overhead
wyatt eyes jonathan on the other side of the glass
insert wyatts pov jonathan explaining himself to the clerk
satisfied wyatt finds a comfortable chair with a direct view of the business centers glass
across the lobby an attractive auburn haired woman in business attire glances over at him
jonathan is subtly slipping the bill to the employee
you forgot your
own room number
i just checked in and its been a hectic day
look at me
the employee looks uneasy something about the ill concealed tension in jonathans eyes
you could just ask at the front desk
im sure they can i really dont have time okay
jonathan presses the bill into the employees palm peers up at the clock again the big hand clicks over to
still eyeing jonathan
he sees the employee hesitate then accept the money
wyatt looks relieved when his view is abruptly blocked by the auburn haired woman
pardon me but may i ask you something personal
wyatt quickly looks up at her momentarily confused
are you waiting for me
the employee finishes swiping his card through a scanner
his view of jonathan still obscured by auburn hair
what the hell are you and then he sees auburn hair glance unsurely at the eloise portrait then at her cell phones clock and now realizes motherfucker
he jumps up shoves auburn hair aside eyes darting to the business center to find jonathan no longer behind the glass just his laptop resting on the counter where hed
jonathan rushes into an elevator car just as its about to close
he turns to find a young family riding up with him
theyve pressed floor
he presses floor
wyatt arrives at the elevators none are ready to open
he furiously presses the call button his hand hovering by his concealed gun
ding as the elevator doors open and the family step out
jonathan is left alone impatiently waiting for the doors to close when his eyes land on something in the hallway the fire alarm
he suddenly reaches out to stop the elevator door just as its about to close
wide shot of an empty hotel hallway as suddenly the fire alarm blares to life
pan to find jonathan dipping into an emergency exit stairwell
wyatt is just about to step onto an elevator when a crowd of wedding guests also start to pile in
furious he abandons the elevators for the nearest stairs
guests spilling out of rooms met by the blaring alarm
as jonathan smashes the glass of yet another fire alarm
surveillance monitors show guests in the various hallways and stairwells rushing in confusion at all angles
weve got alarms on two wait three floors only the party stories above remains oblivious music still blasting the upscale throngs still partying
wyatt is bounding up the stairs rounding the fifth floor when he hears the door overhead bang open and like a tidal wave a flood of guests fill the stairwell
wyatt presses against the crush of bodies pushing his way up the stairwell
close on a door marked by a placard th floor as its banged open by jonathans shoulder
the sound of the fire alarm is fainter up here as jonathan races down the carpeted corridor room numbers blurring past in sporadic fits
jonathan finally lurches to a halt before room
he takes out his key card about to slide it in the slot when a hand grabs his forearm
he spins in panic to a cleaning woman
she says something
in vietnamese indicating the ringing alarms
fire i know ill be out in a minute
the scared cleaning woman nods and hurries off as jonathan quickly slides the key in the slot
the light blinks green
he jerks the door handle and throws open the door to find nothing
the room is freshly made up no sign of life other than a porno film blaring from the tv set on pay per view
jonathans heart is pounding where is she
he searches every corner the bathroom the closets
the sterile room taunts him the uncreased bedspread the neat arrangement of the complimentary stationary the incessant moaning coming from the porn on the tv set jonathan suddenly erupts grips
the tv and shoves it off its ledge
it hits the floor with a crash and sudden silence
jonathan rubs his brow heaving in desperation when his eyes land on the sleek dark piece on which the tv was
resting its a dense rectangular block only when jonathan taps it he realizes its hollow
he immediately seizes it yanks it from the wall
and there she is lying face down in a lifeless heap s
panicked jonathan rushes to her turns her over
she looks semi conscious hands and mouth duct taped
jonathan hurriedly removes the tape gently shakes her terrified by how lifeless she appears when her eyes widen focus on his face
before he can say anything she throws her arms around his neck presses her face to his chest
whispers gratefully youre alive
hes struck by these words and nods holding her face in his hands as he kisses her urgently and gratefully
what do you say we stick together from now on
id like that
a rush of guests hurriedly descending the staircase a seemingly endless stream of densely packed faces
close on wyatt jostled within the flow of the wealthy guests as hes the only one heading up
he passes the th floor
jonathan and s hurrying down the hall jonathan torn between a choice of two stairwells
his eyes dart from one to another he finally gambles on the one to the right
wyatt forcing his way upstream with menacing determination his gaze is wilder more and more irritated by the descending mob of successful well dressed guests hes pushing against when he
halts peering up through the railings lozenge shaped opening past a collection of hands and profiles
to jonathan and s some three stories above
tight on wyatt
as yet unnoticed by jonathan he remains halted on a stair bodies squeezing past him
tighter on his eyes
that predatory gleam
even tighter on his gun tucked carefully at his side
close on jonathan and s three stories above starting to descend when jonathan notices the hint of disruption in the flow of bodies below
immediately wary he leans over the railing but cant get a good look
he grips the railing leans further over
and his eyes find wyatts staring right back up at him hes down there
i saw him oh god up weve got to go up
clutching her arm jonathan and s turn back up against the flow of traffic
stories above less and less people are evacuating
angle on wyatt as he presses upward his steely gaze even more rapacious
the crowd is thinning as jonathan and s race upward as well
insert jonathans pov a shaky dizzying blur as they race higher and higher
insert wyatts pov from below but gaining on them jonathan and s
appearing and disappearing with each twist and turn of the staircase
close on jonathan and s desperately racing upwards
close on wyatt bounding the stairs footsteps echoing the staircase now empty and quiet save for the footfall of jonathan and s no more than three floors above wyatt now
wyatt slows his pace leans into the railing takes aim
close on jonathan and s still hurrying up when a shot rings out a jolting echo clanging through the stairwell the
bullet missing them by inches
s screams jonathan tugs her with him when a second shot rings out the bullet punching a dent into the underside of the stairs just overhead
on wyatt realizing he needs a cleaner shot taking the stairs even harder in pursuit all merciless intensity
the party is still at full throttle
apparently no one has yet told them of the alarms
close on a stairwell door marked emergency exit as it suddenly bangs open and jonathan and s spill out
they pause a moment thrown by the sight of all the wealthy beautiful faces laughing dancing
she grabs his hand and they waste no time disappearing into the mass of bodies
they keep moving
shoulder to shoulder within the swell of partiers they fit right in instantly anonymous though not as smartly attired
back to the stairwell door as wyatt enters the party scanning the dense crowd all senses alert
insert wyatts pov just a mass of successful attractive partying young men and women
theres no way to pick jonathan and s out
wyatts smirk fades to an icy glare as he stalks the periphery
within the crowd s clutches jonathans hand their heads ducked low as they press forward
close on wyatt frustration gnashing at him as he quickens his pace the idiotic enthusiasm of the crowd enraging him sweat beading on his face when suddenly the music stops
close on jonathan and s glancing around in confusion ladies and gentlemen we need everyone to evacuate the hotel
this way please
the crowd noise resumes as the throngs begrudgingly start for the exits
on jonathan and s doing their best to stay concealed within the exiting crowd
angle on wyatt pushing his way through the crush shoving people aside trying to find them when he suddenly stops
he has an idea
he takes out his cell phone
back to jonathan and within the crowd when jonathans cell phone rings
close on jonathan as his eyes widen in panic
he quickly fumbles for it tries to turn it off but its too late
whip across the crowd to wyatt grinning wider
hes spotted them
in an instant he is bee lining through the packed suits
wide shot of the rooftop as the throngs are clearing out
jonathan grabs s as they duck racing across the dark rooftop looking for a place to hide
they take cover behind a large venting duct near the ledge gasping to catch their breath
stepping back ss foot clinks against something a stray iron railing post
down for it starts to lift it when wyatts hand darts in and grasps the other end
she looks up in terror when wyatt punches her violently knocking her to the ground
jonathan rushes to her only to be blocked by wyatt gripping the iron rod tight
nice try back there jonathan
looks like you picked up a thing or two from me
jonathan tries to strike him when with a lightning quick movement wyatt whips the iron rod through the air cracking jonathan across the face
killer instinct pall
jonathan crumples his glasses knocked to the ground
close on wyatt as he grips the iron rod like a tennis racquet steps into position and brings the rod down on jonathan with ruthless tennis strokes backhand
jonathan can barely peer up bloody and beaten
he hears wyatt drop the iron rod
jonathans pov wyatts blurry figure hovering above suddenly swoops in on us as wyatt grabs jonathan by the throat hefts him up and yanks him back to the roofs concrete
jonathan fights to struggle free when wyatt jams the gun under his chin
no no im just a face in the crowd
im a tourist just passing through
jonathans pov wyatts face presses closer now almost in focus as he presses jonathans torso back over the ledge as for you you had your fun
wyatt presses closer crushing jonathans back to the edge
now were going to go back down
insert jonathans hand reaching into wyatts pocket his fingers fumbling for the cell phone jonathans old phone
were going to get that laptop
close on jonathans fingers blindly prodding he has the phone now his fingers feel for the antenna
and were going to finish this once and for when with all his strength jonathan jams the cell phone up into wyatts eye the antenna punching into the retina
wyatts grasp slips from jonathans collar as he stumbles back cupping a hand to his wound as he swings his gun toward jonathan when with every ounce of strength jonathan
charges wyatts shot missing him as jonathan slams him into the ledge wall seizing the momentum to turn himself as wyatt falls right over the edge of the hotel rooftop
wyatts body plummeting down the magnificent facade vanishing into the vastness of the city below
close on jonathan as he crawls to the ledge peers down into the darkness
he exhales then turns back to s to find shes right beside him grateful tears in her eye
she leans into him and he holds her tight the two of them embraced on the precipice as we strobed reds and blues of police and fire
trucks amassed trying to control the throngs of guests and pedestrians blocking our view of the body theyre all gawking at
we travel through the confusion until we find jonathan and s sitting side by side on the sidewalk curb each propped against the other
the shock of it all is beginning to fade
he reaches into his pocket and hands her duck on bike
yours i believe
she winds the toy up
they watch it make its funny way down the sidewalk
can i ask you something personal
whats your name
s considers the request then smiles gently leans in close and whispers the answer in his ear
jonathan gazes at her a moment whatever her name is it must be perfect
so what now
she smiles up at him
are you free tonight
on jonathan treasuring these moments
he is truly free perhaps for the first time in his life
they gaze at each other
we leave jonathan and s to their privacy pulling back as they continue talking continuing away until were the window itself now a frame letter boxing the scene people passing
like fish in their tank
except for jonathan and s seated center frame two small figures side by side face to face talking intimately as we
