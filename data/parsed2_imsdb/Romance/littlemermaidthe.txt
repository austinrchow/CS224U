flounder seeing shark looming behind him

shark chases them all around
ariels bag is hung up

they crash through and go round and round
flounder gets knocked silly but ariel saves him and traps shark you big bully
shark snaps at him and he swims away

scuttle on his island humming and looking through his telescope
scuttle looking through the telescope the wrong way shouting
mermaid off the port bow

flounder yeah we were in this sunken ship it was really creepy
scuttle human stuff huh

scuttle its a dinglehopper
humans use these little babies
to straighten their hair out

you got an aesthetically pleasing configuration of hair that humans go nuts over
ariel a dinglehopper
flounder what about that one
scuttle holding pipe ah this i havent seen in years
this is wonderful
a banded bulbous snarfblat
ariel and flounder oohhh
scuttle now the snarfblat dates back to prehistorical times when humans used to sit around and stare at each other all day
got very boring
so they invented the snarfblat to make fine music
scuttle blows into the pipe seaweed pops out the other end
oh the concert
oh my gosh my fathers gonna kill me
flounder the concert was today
scuttle still contemplating pipe
maybe you could make a little planter out of it or somethin
ariel uh im sorry ive gotta go

scuttle anytime sweetie anytime
cut to flotsam and jetsam then ursula in background watching magic projection of ariel swimming
ursula yeeeeeees hurry home princess
we wouldnt want to miss old daddys celebration now would we
in my day we had fantastical feasts when i lived in the palace
and now look at me wasted away to practically nothing banished and exiled and practically starving while he and his flimsy fish folk celebrate
well ill give em something to celebrate soon enough
i want you to keep an extra close watch on this pretty little daughter of his
she may be the key to tritons undoing
fade to the palace throne room where ariel is being admonished
triton i just dont know what were going to do with you young lady
ariel daddy im sorry i just forgot i triton as a result of your careless behaviour sebastian careless and reckless behaviour
triton the entire celebration was er sebastian well it was ruined
this concert was to be the pinnacle of my distinguished career
now thanks to you i am the laughing stock of the entire kingdom
flounder but it wasnt her fault
ah well first ahh this shark chased us yeah yeah

we mustnt lurk in doorways its rude
one might question your upbringing
youre here because you have a thing for this human
this er prince fellow
not that i blame you he is quite a catch isnt he
well angel fish the solution to your problem is simple
the only way to get what you want is to become a human yourself
ariel can you do that
ursula my dear sweet child
thats what i do its what i live for
to help unfortunate merfolk like yourself
poor souls with no one else to turn to
i admit that in the past ive been a nasty they werent kidding when they called me well a witch but youll find that nowadays ive mended all my ways
repented seen the light and made a switch true
yes and i fortunately know a little magic its a talent that i always have possessed and here lately please dont laugh i use it on behalf of the miserable
lonely and depressed pathetic poor unfortunate souls in pain in need this one longing to be thinner that one wants to get the girl and do i help them
yes indeed those poor unfortunate souls so sad so true they come flocking to my cauldron crying spells ursula please
and i help them
yes i do now its happened once or twice someone couldnt pay the price and im afraid i had to rake em cross the coals yes ive had the odd
complaint but on the whole ive been a saint to those poor unfortunate souls now heres the deal
i will make you a potion that will turn you into a human for three days
now listen this is import ant
before the sun sets on the third day youve got to get dear ol princey to fall in love with you
that is hes got to kiss you
not just any kiss the kiss of true love
if he does kiss you before the sun sets on the third day youll remain human permanently but if he doesnt you turn back into a mermaid and you belong
sebastion no ariel
he is silenced by flotsam and jetsam
ursula have we got a deal
ariel if i become human ill never be with my father or sisters again
ursula thats right
but youll have your man
lifes full of tough choices innit
oh and there is one more thing
we havent discussed the subject of payment
you cant get something for nothing you know
ariel but i dont have any ursula im not asking much

youll never even miss it
what i want from you is
ariel my voice
ursula youve got it sweetcakes
no more talking singing zip
ariel but without my voice how can i ursula youll have your looks
your pretty face
and dont underestimate the importance of body language
the men up there dont like a lot of blabber they think a girl who gossips is a bore yes on land its much preferred for ladies not to say
a word and after all dear what is idle prattle for
come on theyre not all that impressed with conversation true gentlemen avoid it when they can but they dote and swoon and fawn on a lady whos withdrawn its she
who holds her tongue who gets her man come on you poor unfortunate soul go ahead
make your choice
im a very busy woman and i havent got all day it wont cost much just your voice

laughing she transforms into a human with ariels voice
fade to castle at night
eric is playing the flute and contemplating as grimsby approaches
grimsby eric if i may say far better than any dream girl is one of flesh and blood one warm and caring and right before your eyes

he is distracted by ursula vanessa singing with ariels voice and is placed under her spell
scuttle flying toward castle in morning

i didnt know triton attacks the contract with a fierce blast from his trident to no avail
ursula you see
the contracts legal binding and completely unbreakable even for you

the daughter of the great sea king is a very precious commodity
but i might be willing to make an exchange for someone even better

ariel makes her miss eric and blast flotsam and jetsam
my poor little poopsies
on surface as ursula grows beneath
ariel eric youve got to get away from here
eric no i wont leave you
ursula now very large
you pitiful insignificant fool
eric look out
ursula now i am the ruler of all the ocean
the waves obey my every whim
the sea and all its spoils bow to my power
she wrecks havoc creates a whirlpool and raises some shipwrecks
he gets on board one of the ships as ariel falls to the bottom of the whirlpool
ursula attempts to blast her
ursula laughing wickedly
so much for true love
as ursula is about to finish ariel eric steers the ship into her
she is impaled and dies most horribly
eric collapses on the shore
the trident falls back to triton and everything reverts to normal
fade to morning with eric on beach and ariel watching from a distance
triton and sebastion look on
triton she really does love him doesnt she sebastian
sebastian well its like i always say your majesty
children got to be free to lead their own lives
triton you always say that
sighs then i guess theres just one problem left
sebastian and whats that your majesty
triton how much im going to miss her
he turns her into a human and she goes to meet eric
they kiss which fades into kiss on wedding day
everyone is happy
sebastion is attacked by louis
he beats louis up and returns to the sea
sebastion yes thank you thank you
ariel and triton hug
ariel i love you daddy
big finale while part of your world music plays
ship sails off as ariel and eric kiss
