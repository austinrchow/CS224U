href b b by luc besson bob garland marylin golden god is at the bottom of the sea and i dive to find him
enzo maiorca the image is in black and white
the sun disappears behind arid cliffs which cast giant shadows on the sea
a little boy around years old tanned from head to toe sprints along the cliffs scrambles from one rock to another with amazing agility
in one hand he carries a transparent plastic bag
in the other a net bag containing flippers mask pants and sweater
the only thing that slows him down is his bathing suit obvious hand me downs way too big
he tugs on them as he goes holding them up
until they slide again
as he leaps again
and pulls them up
the little boy is jacques mayol
jacques reaches a ledge jutting out over a deserted cove
he spits in his mask
expertly spreads the spit with a finger
locks his feet into the flippers
he surfaces a long way out
adjusts his mask
and swims away from shore
the boy stops swimming starts to gulp air sucks it in oxygenating his blood in a series of deep rapid breaths almost hyperventilating almost alarming if weve never seen this
his gaze is glued to the ocean floor
clear clear water
and intensely blue
suddenly he catches his breath and dives into the blue
jacques touches bottom
clamps his legs around a rock to hold himself down
unhurried thoroughly at home feet under
he opens the plastic bag
a huge speckled moray eel appears in a hole in the rock slithers toward him
the carnivores jaws are bigger than the boys head
the boy smiles at him
pulls a piece of raw meat out of his bag and holds it out
the eel takes the morsel delicately and slithers back into his hole
gravely jacques takes another morsel out of the bag
jacques walks up a steep road bordering the port almost dry now
two boys about his age run up the streets call out catch up with him and gesture toward the port
the little boys tug jacques to the end of the pier and point to something in the water
jacques walks over and sure enough sees something shining a few feet down in the water
squinting a coin
i found it
camera pans and we see a middle aged priest loading supplies into a small boat
he stops to watch the childrens negotiations
little jacques is putting his flippers on
ill get it but no fighting all right
the two boys nod as they point to the coin
well split it
you cant split a coin
the pope smiles
then well buy something and split that
its a small coin
i dont want a ferrari
what is it
interrupting them maybe a little radio
the two boys look at each other
well decide later
the light is going
i get the radio from after school until midnight
since when do you stay up until midnight
all right all right
can i concentrate
and you can stop pointing
ive seen it
ive seen it too
the voice is enzos
another young boy wearing little round glasses
annoyed shit its the italian
he is slightly older than jacques but he is taller
enzo is with roberto his younger brother the only one allowed to carry his flippers
five kids are behind him
well if it isnt the little frenchman
how is the little frenchman
enzo pats jacques on the shoulder and leaves his hand there a lightly intimidating gesture
you dont mind if i go instead do you
intimidated and pretending not to be no
if you did mind youd tell me wouldnt you
enzo pats his shoulder reassuringly
to his brother roberto mio palmo
roberto who has already started to moisten his big brothers gear in the water holds a pair of dripping flippers and a glistening mask
the pope watches the scene with obvious pleasure
to his brother on the edge of the pier count
sure of himself enzo takes a deep breath and dives in the water
roberto counts out loud
the kids all walk over to the edge of the pier
a few feet away jacques takes off his flippers
enzo bursts out of the water the coin in his hand
the children cheer and clap
roberto rushes to catch the equipment that comes flying at him piece by piece
enzo walks over to jacques
showing him the coin whos is it now
you saw it but i dove for it
jacques doesnt answer
enzo smiles and slowly puts the coin in his pocket
he pulls it out again and waves it under jacques nose
without turning around roberto
enzo looks at jacques for a while
ill throw it back into the water
you dive and if you do less than six its yours
jacques doesnt say anything then finally shakes his head negatively
enzo smiles taps him on the shoulder
the first boy finally sums up his courage to speak
i saw the coin first
smiling you cant split a coin stupid
enzo laughing sticks the coin in his pocket and leaves the pier with his gang
the pope smiles and pulls a coin from his pocket
with his flippers dangling from one hand jacques sadly stares out at the sea
the pope calls him over
jacques goes over to him sees where he is pointing the faint gleam of the coin underwater
is it a coin shining down there
overjoyed it is
its a coin
ill get it for you father
itll be for the poor
jacques intent on the coins glimmer quickly slips on his fins prepares his mask
he swims in the water like a fish goes directly to the coin
scoops it up brings it to the surface
he breaks water waves the coin looks for the priest and sees he is no longer there
he looks at the ancient impression on the coin boy on a dolphin
hes swimming near the spot where he fed the moray eel
he senses something behind him and turns around
he sees a dolphin still and silent floating vertically
it seems to be watching him
the surprise is such that jacques is in a panic leaps up to the surface
he bolts upright as if suddenly awakening from a dream
a burly man around fifty crosses the room in the shadows and throws open the shutters with a bang
sunlight pours in
he walks over to jacques bed in the one room house and runs his hand through his hair
with a smile come on time to get up jacques
jacques rubs his eyes
his father walks over to a pile of blankets on the floor on the other side of the room
he gives the pile a kick
screaming at the top of his lungs louis wake up
he uncovers a kettle on the fire and ladles up a big bowl of soup for jacques
a fifty year old man pokes his head out from under the pile of blankets
its uncle louis who is having a very hard time waking up
jacques bursts out of the house running
diving gear under his arm
a piece of buttered bread in his mouth
he catches up with his father and uncle louis
theyre on a path winding down to the port
jacques slows down abruptly
tries to imitate their stride
the weather is balmy and the sea lies before them peaceful and blue
their boat on the water
the chug of its engine echoes off the cliffs
a few gulls drawn by the sound skim the waves of its wake
jacques father checks the antique air pump
jacques polishes the enormous copper divers helmet and lays out the rest of an old fashioned deep sea divers suit
at the foot of an old monastery another boat passes
the priest is in it
jacques father and louis take off their caps
jacques takes the gold coin out of his pocket
the pope nods to jacques
his father looks over at him without understanding
the child quickly puts the coin back in his pocket
louis casts anchor
a few feet away siting on a rock the kid with little round glasses is fishing
he turns around to the boat
jacques smiles and waves at him
enzo waves back obviously disturbed in his fishing session
jacques come help me
jacques helps his father into the divers suit
the burly man struggles into a pair of weighted lead shoes
he seems sluggish and tired
jacques watches worriedly
he has a weird feeling
you shouldnt dive everyday papa
then you shouldnt eat everyday jacques
his father catches him fondly by the scruff of the neck
winks at him dont worry
when im tired down there the mermaids help me out
father and son smile at each other
then his father puts the helmet on
jacques joins louis at the pump
the heavy divers suit disappears slowly underwater
the gleaming copper helmet is the last thing to slide out of sight
jacques and louis work the pump
regular steady motions to maintain the flow of air
to jacques hey
have you ever seen a mermaid
they keep on pumping for a while then
ive seen them
uncle louis goes on
jacques doesnt budge
dont you want to know where
jacques looks at the bottom to watch his father
he doesnt answer
he moves along slowly in his cumbersome diving suit
he is working the top of a rock outcrop on the sea floor
he sees a sponge hooks it puts it in a bag thats attached to a life line from the boat fastened to his waist
he moves on
they keep up the rhythm
sitting on a rock at a distance enzo watches them
uncle louis is bored stiff
why dont you ask me
where i saw the mermaids
why dont you ever ask any question
im always the one asking the question
were sitting here like two stones and im taking to myself
ask me something goddamnit
jacques calmly looks over at him slows down his pumping and almost serenely asks him in a completely flat tone why did my mother leave
uncle louis seems disturbed by the question
ill at ease come on now pump
he is walking with difficulty at the bottom
his bag is full of sponges
he seems to be having trouble breathing
jacques and louis are pumping silently
uncle louis feels obliged to answer jacques question
uncle louis finally breaks the silence and explains your mother didnt leave
she went back to america thats all
its her home
shes allergic to this island
she likes refrigerators and machines that clean the floor
so one day she left
woman are like that unpredictable like the sea
they havent been paying attention to the bubbles gushing at the surface
the air hose is being pulled down in a very worrisome way
with a slight grin so where did you see mermaids
uncle louis smiles
in the bars in athens
very pleased with himself uncle louis burst out laughing
jacques shyly shrugs his shoulders
the air hose is suddenly yanked down
jacques immediately sees all the bubbles
he is white as a sheet
jacques rushes to the side of the boat and starts yelling down at his father
he grabs the life line and starts pulling at it hysterically
the air hose snaps and starts flying around like some crazy snake
jacques tries to jump overboard
uncle louis catches hold of his foot at the last second
jacques is slapping the water with his hands trying to go down but uncle louis wont let him
jacques is yelling desperately
enzo is now standing on his rock watching the scene horrified
the sea now looks as if it were boiling
uncle louis grabs hold of jacques and hugs him in his arms
standing on his rock enzo is now crying desperately
the last air bubbles are now breaking on the surface it looks as if they will never stop
the image is now in color
a rocky pink cliff over looks the very bright sea which fills the screen
alfredo runs skips up the cobbled street as fast as he can go surprisingly fast
he runs to the large terrace of a restaurant which he enters
we have time to read the sign carrying the restaurants name la mamma
alfredo skips in
he is panting covered in sweat
his panic is palpable
the whole room watches him approach a long table where a large family is having a birthday party for a very old lady
he has to stop a second and catch his breath before he can get the words out
then leans over and whispers in the ear of a great big man around built like a bull wearing little round glasses
the man listens then stiffens
a beat up fiat towing an equally beat up trailer stops
enzo unfolds out of the drivers seat like a circus clown emerging from a toy car
the construction supervisor an american wearing a three piece suit hurries over to him
enzo has already started undressing
roberto unloads the diving gear from the trailer
exhausted signore molinari
shaking his hand yes
calmly undressing expressionless how did it happen
upset the company asked me to extract everything i could from the wreck so the divers were trying to get at the engine
and then the boat turned over
in the current
look i fucked up
can you help
how many are down there
enzo goes back to the car
were feeding him air but hes not breathing regularly
youve got to get him out fast
enzo glances at the map then at the accident site
a beat ten thousand
youre going to hold me up at a time like this
you do understand youre talking to the champion diver of the world
yes but ten thousand dollars
enzo opens the trunk of his fiat and pulls out the jack
he slams the trunk shut and stands looking at the american straight in the eyes
you tell me
how much would you say the mans life is worth
extremely uncomfortable the supervisor doesnt answer
in my village we have a saying when the wind blows the flags of all nations flap in the same direction
baffled what does that mean
that you should get your checkbook
hes at the end of the pier his feet dangling in the muddy water of the port
a few feet away a pump sends air hissing through a rubber tube to the diver trapped below
enzo inhales steadily his chest heaving like a bellow
he carefully puts his spectacles inside his shoes dons his flippers etc
with his usual flair of suspense
behind him the supervisor and other construction workers watch expectantly
roberto heaves a stone weight into the bay a cable attached to it plays out from a drum on the pier
enzo ignoring everyone grabs the ordinary tire jack flip flops over to the now taut cable the stone has hit bottom
he takes a deep breath and dives into the bay
enzo dives down a chimney of muck
picks his way over and around every hazard until he reaches the diver trapped under a huge piece of debris
he pats his shoulder to comfort him he then inserts the tire jack under a piece of concrete
and as if he were changing a tire begins to pump the handle
slowly in a swirl of mud and water the chunk of debris rises off the divers leg
everyone is staring at the water silently suspensefully
the supervisor has his checkbook in hand but has completely forgotten it intent upon whats going on underwater
roberto taps him on the shoulder
since we have a little time what do you say you write that check
enzo cuts the cables tangled around the divers torso
then he takes off his flippers plants his bare feet on the concrete grabs the diver by the shoulders and pulls him free
the diver drops the air tube and climbs as quickly as possible toward the surface
the diver surfaces gasping for breath
a cheer goes up from the crowd
several men hurry to pull him onto dry land
but there is no sign of enzo
everyone waits breathless
to the supervisor sign here
suddenly enzo appears burst out of the water holding his flippers up in the air like a trophy
the onlookers cheer help him out of the water slapping him on the back
enzo tosses the jack and his flippers to roberto
impassive and silent he slips his arms into the prize fighters robe that roberto holds out for him walks solemnly back to his car
roberto takes the check and walks over to the car
enzo bends down into the car and opens the roof
through the open roof smiling thanks thanks a lot
i mean that too
you extortionist bastard
the car rushes off
in the distance we see a police carabinieri car and an old fire engine rolling in the direction of the construction site
enzos car drives past them
enzo looks at roberto out of the corner of his eye then suddenly explodes with joy
we took him for ten thousand dollars
roberto whoops and whistles
enzo reaches over and leans on the horn
the little car races by and finally stops at the top of the cliff facing the sea
the two brothers sit back relax
stare out to sea
after a while enzo what are you going to do with the money
have the car painted
santini will do that for dollars
then tell him to wax it too
what are you going to get
thinking a rosary for mama a dress for angelica something with rhine stones for whats her name and get yourself a suit that fits
but most important
find the frenchman
find me mayol
mountain peaks stark and white
a winter sky which is strangely and disquietingly dark
a landscape swept by snow
a yellow light comes out of the storm advances toward us
the headlight of a train
a narrow gauge locomotive steams up grade pushing piles of snow in front of it
sitting in the train leaning against the misty window johana cross has clear quick charm and a sort of romantic fragility
she is dressed simply but warmly
she looks through the window all she sees is white
it is clear that she was not the one who decided on this trip
reading the key phrases from a beat up note book she calls upon an old peruvian
in spanish is this the lago del demonio
es bien aqui el lago del demonio huacracocha
the old man goes into a long rambling explanation
johana nods without understanding a thing
the train pulls in slowly pushing piles of snow in front of it and finally stops in front of an old shack which serves as the station
a man frank bundled in a parka comes out of a snowmobile parked by the station and walks up to the train
johana steps down carrying her suitcase and drops two feet in the snow as she comes off the last step
frank walks over and leans down towards her
smiling welcome to peru
frank throws the luggage into the back of the snowmobile jumps in and turns the ignition on
johana takes her hat scarf and gloves off
frank glances over at her he is both amused and charmed
dont you have a heater
hitting at the dashboard yeah
is this your first trip to peru
does anybody live to make a second
frank smiles and kicks the heating system then leans over to check it his eyes off the road
a little worried forget about the heater
the storm is at its peak
the frozen snowmobile plows along side the lake huacracocha and stops in front of a cluster of quonset huts almost completely buried in snow
frank gets the bags out of the back
the suitcases are by now frozen stiff
johana follows in his steps
a couple of llamas are huddled up against the hut in attempt to protect themselves from the storm
johana is bewildered
shacks in the middle of the andes the lake of the demon and now llama that have to be pushed aside to enter ones home
as frank opens the door a man is leaving the hut
the man is jacques mayol
johana and jacques pass each other in slow motion
everything seems suddenly suspended time sound cold
jacques mayol instantly makes an impression on her
he is now still dark haired with dark eyes
he is wearing a red diving suit and a pair of round goggles
he looks like some legendary creature one would dream about
everything finally regains its formal speed
the door slams the man is gone
she and frank are in the middle of the entrance hall
johana hasnt yet gotten over the vision she has just had but she regains composure and enters the next room
johana happily takes her gloves off
frank puts down the bags and walks into the next room
its a sort of laboratory filled with ultra modern equipment
a big bay window overlooks the lake on which is built a long wooden dock
sitting in a corner an old peruvian man is preparing hot drinks
johana drops into a chair
a drink to warm up
yes thank you
intravenous if possible
pulling out a flask tea
did i just see a man in a red suit and goggles
frank smiles and pours some whiskey in her tea cup
calling out dr
the insurance man
the insurance person is here
its about time
frank smiles and pours johana some tea
she warms her hands on the cup
she asks blankly
would it be out of place to ask what hes doing
the guy in the halloween suit
lawrence comes in from the other side of the room
he walks straight over to the bay window
did you have a nice trip
we were getting restless its been three weeks since the accident
johana walks over to the bay window and starts staring at something in the distance
at the end of the dock jacques who is sitting on the edge of a hole which is cut in the ice is putting a pair of gloves on
he then grabs the handles of a strange machine which emerges from the water and starts taking deep breaths oblivious to the cold his mind completely elsewhere
johana watches jacques
she just cant believe her eyes
lawrence is bent over one of his machines fiddling with different switches
to johana you should get things moving you know
were out of equipment and we cant do half of our experiments
frank check the program
johana is finally able to speak
who is that
thats the experiment
dumping a guy into a frozen lake
lawrence turns one last knob
the truck fell into a very deep crevasse
we werent able to save the equipment
ill have to talk to the driver
in the spring when he melts
johana walks closer to the window
she isnt hearing a thing hes saying
jacques is putting on his flippers
johana cant believe it
jacques is standing by a hole cut in the ice
he is holding onto the machine in the water
he is waving a mask
dumbfounded you really send him under the ice
he isnt a slave or a convict or anything
my dear science is a cruel mistress
how is he going to breathe
he isnt going to breathe
jacques takes a deep breath turns a handle and a weight yanks him straight down into the water
lawrence sets his stop watch off and flips a few switches
johana grabs his arm as if they could do something about it
he raises the volume we hear the mans heartbeat through a small speaker
thats his heartbeat
excited can you hear the speed at which its slowing down its incredible
lawrence tears off the sheet with the heartbeat measures on it and hands it to johana
johana feels shes on the verge of crying and cant figure it out
jacques stops his machine by turning one of the handles
hes deep beneath the surface of the frozen lake
he swims deliberately carefully into a large tube which is hinged open
he closes it around himself
his heart is still slowing down
he pushes a button on the machine and a flash of light bursts in the opaque night surrounding him
we see a moving x ray image
hes in the fluoroscope now
listen to his heart
the flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesnt even feed the limbs anymore
its a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins
how long can he stay down
he should come up soon
smiling unless hes decided to stay for the night
why is he doing this
for one thing its his job
as for the rest of it i wish i knew
johana sighs with relief as jacques appears at the surface in one big breath
shouldnt somebody take him a blanket or something
smiling at frank coffee might be nice
she heads towards the old peruvian and pours a cup of coffee
afterthought will he understand spanish
his mothers an american
he spent half of his life in the states
id try english if i were you
hes groggy half hypnotized
he looks up at the dock sees johana with a cup of coffee
he stares at her
she hands him the coffee
puzzled i recognize you
we saw each other a little while ago
serious in the lake
wondering whether he is joking or not no
in the hut
after a long beat
with a beautiful smile then it was somebody that looked a lot like you
jacques then turns around and walks toward the huts
johana still hasnt moved as if petrified by her emotions and the severe cold
she then walks up to the hole in the ice and peers into the dark water
johana emerges from a down sleeping bag
shes wearing a big sweater and a wool hat
she is not sleeping
intrigued by the sound of the snowmobile she gets up and walks over to the frozen window
jacques and frank are loading their luggage onto the snowmobile
outside lawrence is saying goodbye to jacques
unseen johana also waves from behind her curtain
jacques senses something he turns around toward the cabin and smiles waving his hand at johana
she hides behind the curtain and shyly waves back
jacques gets into the snowmobile and drives out of the frame
we are left with an endless array of snow caped mountains
fixed image of the cote dazur
the sparkling blue sea fades into the distance
a french taxi rides along the winding road overlooking the creeks
from behind all his bags jacques obsessively stares at the sea
the driver smiles
its beautiful isnt it
we had some bad wind this week
there isnt one olive left on its tree
it suddenly left us this morning
i sure wont be the one to call it back
the taxi comes to a stop in front of marineland
jacques gets out carrying one of his bags
to the driver ill only be five minutes
he enters marineland
the park is closed the paths are deserted
jacques approaches the dolphins tank
all three dolphins rise up in the water
greet him with a click and clatter of tongues
jacques sits down at the edge of the tank
good morning everybody
did you sleep well
i slept in a plane and it wasnt too great
he opens his duffel bag
hunts around comes up with two packages wrapped in brownpaper
the dolphins stare at him intrigued
calling out hey
the dolphins cackle some more
you think id forget you
the driver who seems to be quite familiar with the place walks in heading straight over to the soda machine
out of the corner of his eye he takes in the scene very intrigued
jacques has not noticed him
he starts unwrapping the first package
he produces a little ceramic llama
looking at the llama bewildered
as bewildered as a dolphin can be
jacques turns the llama upside down
it moos hiak hiak
its a llama
bathsheba shakes her head
jacques throws the llama into the water
he unwraps the second package
a pair of peruvian gloves and hat
wide eyed the driver sits in the stands to watch the show
thats for you darjeeling
we wouldnt want you to catch cold
he throws them to darjeeling who catches them
singing out ta da
for you tina
he pulls out a thermos
something youve never seen either
he opens the thermos
he sprinkles snow flakes on tinas head
she tries to taste it
smiling like a child a new experience tina
nostalgic i missed you little rascals
did you get my post card
the three dolphins leap into the air and land with a huge splash which soaks jacques
he takes his shirt off
pretending to be serious oh
is that what you want
alright but five minutes no more
i have a taxi waiting
he takes off his pants
the taxi driver gets up as if to keep him from going in
jacques dives into the pool
he swims under the dolphin reaches out and grabs hold of the dolphins snout
the dolphin pulls jacques around and around the basin while jacques pets his chest and belly
we have never seen jacques so relaxed and happy
overview of a gray and dirty manhattan morning
johana depressed stares blankly out of the window of a yellow cab
she watches the muddy brown water flow under the brooklyn bridge
the driver keeps yelling obscenities to all the cars around him
a suitcase in each hand johana gets out of the cab and walks up the stairs of her apartment
johana puts down her suitcase wearily
catches her breath and gets out her keys
she tries one in the top lock
it doesnt work
she tries harder
theres a womans voice yelling angrily from inside the apartment
i changed the lock you son of a bitch
the door opens
we were burgled
they got the new t
johana comes in looks at the ransacked apartment
and the new stereo
i hope they remembered to take the microwave this time
how was your trip
help me clean up okay
you called the police
theyre going to send detectives
when they get around to it
shrugging so what all they ever want is your phone number anyway
johana goes over slumps into an easy chair and sighs
after a beat
how was your trip
doubtfully i guess
whod you meet
johana opens her handbag takes out the strip of electrocardiogram paper hands it to her
you met a doctor
congratulations youre in the chips
an afterthought unless they have socialized medicine in peru
indicating paper its his heartbeat
ill make some coffee
starts toward kitchen they left the stove
the living room is almost completely put back together
sally is replacing books in the bookcase johana is using a carpet sweeper and talking away
nonstop maybe you cant be sure you know the flippers they add height or they take it away or something
anyway short dark hair
not punk or anything just short
and the cutest smile
he wasnt smiling at me i dont think just smiling
and he thought he saw me in the lake
i mean that was a figure of speech
theyre so romantic the french
bored half asleep i thought you said he was peruvian
annoyed havent you been listening
sally opens the drapes revealing its dawn outside
since eight oclock last night
youre in love
dont be a jerk
emphatically theres no such thing as love at first sight
jacques is swimming alone at the bottom of a gigantic swimming pool
he wears a monofin his head and chest are wired up to an assistant who runs back and forth alongside the pool
a mans feet are seen walking over to the side of the pool
jacques is swimming laps arching his body like a dolphin
as he approaches one end of the pool he sees a coin slowly falling in front of him
jacques picks it up and looks at it its an old greek coin
jacques smiles and swims to the surface
jacques pokes his head out of the water and pulls off his goggles
enzo stands over him smiling
jacques my friend how are you
i leave you swimming and twenty years later youre still in the water
what the hell are you doing
an uneasiness sweeps over enzos face and quickly disappears
smiling again you never would have recognized me huh
check out the suit
looking good no
you know im the world champion
yes i know
i dove feet
they say im like lazarus
you know the guy who was raised from the dead
enzo goes on
serious doesnt it surprise you that i just show up like this
listen the world championship starts in ten days in taormina
be my guest
enzo puts down an airplane ticket on the side of the pool
surprised jacques looks over at the ticket
because im sure youre dying to beat me
shaking his head i dont want to be in any competition
i dive because i like to not to beat a record
dont you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him
all you need is to want to be the best
smiles youre the best enzo
with a tense grin on his face thats too easy
every time i beat a record theres always some dumbshit asking me dyou know that french guy mayol
hes supposed to be very good
too bad he doesnt compete
so youre going to come with me to taormina
first because youre my friend and second because you dont have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure
he pushes the airplane ticket to jacques ill see you there
she is seated across the desk from him
hes reading through her report
behind him outside the large plate glass window window washers are seated on a scaffold suspended far above the city
they eat lunch
johanas eyes wander bored around the office as duffy reads
he looks up
indicating report this is good work
unfortunately its incomplete
he glances at the window could you eat a sandwich floors above the street
absently what kind
johana am i boring you
of course not definitely not
well maybe a little
what did you say
i said that the file is incomplete
see if you can get through to this lawrence character and have him send the peruvian registration for his missing truck
and dont let him tell you it was in the glove compartment
she starts out of the office
to her back did the driver really freeze
like a popsicle
theyre keeping him on a stick until spring
im glad i didnt go
under her breath leaving so am i
doctor lawrence covers one ear with his hand as he yells into the phone
screaming i said all the truck papers are in the glove compartment
johana sits at her desk she too is yelling into the telephone
her colleague looks over at her and smiles
with a sigh okay listen just get the customs office to send me a copy as fast as possible
we cant send you new equipment until our file is complete
youll have it by the end of the week hows that
youve made me a happy insurance person
he is just about to hang up
johana jumps up
johana starts snooping around the papers on her desk embarrassed by the presence of her colleague
as softly as possible you dont know how i could reach that diver of yours
we need some additional information
i mean we have a few questions to ask him
the last thing i heard he was off to taormina for the world diving championships
thats taormina in sicily
johana dashes in without knocking
listen i just found out weve got real problems in sicily
alarmed what dyou mean
improvising the mafia
la cosa nostra
i knew it
i knew we shouldnt have written that policy
pale whats happened
the documents are forged
the notary is a phony
he has the same signature as the contractor
outraged it cant be true
fast talking we have to send somebody over there immediately
if we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy
well be off the hook
theres a flight to rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to sicily
reaching for phone ill send cardoza hell be able to
interrupting i tried him he cant go
his son is being bar mitzvohed tomorrow
ill go boss
i thought it was spanish that you spoke
after a beat italian is practically the same thing
a ferry comes into the dock as a plank is slowly lowered
as it descends four rail cars lie in wait in its belly
johana comes off the boat carrying her suitcase she wears a light summer dress
she looks around seeming a little lost
a white fiat taxi screeches to a halt beside her
the driver whose arm loosely dangles from the car window grins at her
the white fiat taxi pulls up in front of the san domenico hotel but it is jacques who gets out of it
the driver helps him with his bags
checking the books mayol
uncomfortable are you sure
jacques looks down at the piece of paper stapled to his ticket
this is the hotel san domenico
yes sir and it has been so for years
more and more uncomfortable yes but
so you havent got a room left
no sir the hotel is full because of the diving championship
the receptionist starts working on his papers again
jacques completely lost stares blankly at the hotel clerk wondering what to do next
the tiny fiat clatters onto the sidewalk in front of the hotel narrowly avoiding the countess limo
parks its frontwheels on the sidewalk rear end in the road
enzo followed by roberto get out of his car like a king descending from his carriage
on the way he stops and kisses a distinguished elderly womans hand
the hotels enzo tosses his keys to a doorman who stepped up to complain
to doorman be careful with that car its a new paint job
enzo enters the hotel and sees jacques
yelling across the lobby giacomino
enzo and jacques
the two men kiss each other on both cheeks pound each others back
they are both moved
looking at him so you finally decided to join us
you did the right thing
to the desk clerk hey paolo
get my key
to jacques gesturing over his shoulder you remember my little brother roberto
roberto nods to jacques who shakes his hand
what room have you got
i dont have one
you dont have a room
at the top of his lungs paolo
what did i just hear
i personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend jacques mayol and you treat him like a stranger
embarrassed its okay enzo
ill go somewhere else
not only is jacques mayol a very special friend but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world
and youre throwing him out
are you crazy or what
really embarrassed now enzo drop it ill find something
enzo looks at him for a moment and gives him a warm smile
he hands him his own keys
ill take the countess suite
she told me she was leaving for the cemetery
shell be more comfortable there
paolo half heartedly hands him the key
enzo glances at jacques to make sure hes properly impressed
he throws his arm around jacques shoulder hugs him and gives him a real smile
sincerely im glad youre here
theyre at a table on a terrace that overlooks the sea
theyve just arrived and all around them people are lunching away furiously
enzo beckons to a passing waiter who comes to the table
hes a very handsome slightly effeminate young man
to waiter spaghetti del mare to jacques its delicious here
its the one thing they really know how to make
del mare for two
nodding quickly yes sure for two
and a bottle of frascatti
si signore grazie mille
the waiter hurries away
enzo watches his departure then thoughtfully
he moves just like a woman
then as if he were speaking to jacques it must be hard to live in two worlds like that huh
to breathe in one swim in the other
jacques nods without really knowing
suddenly louder anyway
nothing beats a sexy broad
enzo starts laughing
jacques would like to crawl under the table
their lunch is on the table half eaten
so after all these years you must have lots of questions to ask
am i right
quickly yes of course
lots of questions
jacques is satisfied with his answer
he thinks that the subject is closed
they eat silently for a moment
enzo watches him
then well what are they
giving up im sorry
i dont know how to ask the questions
enzo bursts out laughing
ill do the asking for you
tell me dear enzo how did you become world champion
oh thats a long story
his voice changes well after you left amorgos i went back to italy and joined the navy
so you now have in front of you captain molinari whos been on leave of absence for the past years
how do you make a living
your experiments does it pay well
jacques doesnt seem to have ever thought about marriage
me neither cause of my mother
shes a curse my mamma a tornado
stubborn as a mule
i was engaged
for a week
after that mamma was so mad i tell you pasta was bouncing off the walls
so not married
well good for you
you play the field like me
a girl in every port huh
bluffing exactly i mean after all were men
slapping the table top damn right
thats what i tell them when people say youve turned into a fish
concerned people say that
sorry he went too far forget it
i was joking
johana comes out of the stone tunnel which leads to the terrace
she looks over the crowd trying to find someone
jacques is sitting with his back to her
she finally spots him and walks over to the table
this one is for me
ill bet you my watch that shes in my bed tonight
jacques turns around and recognizes her
johana smiles and walks up to the table
enzo takes his watch off and puts it on the table
quickly i tell you shes mine
to jacques hello
surprised you know each other
enzo kisses her hand and brushes his watch off the table in the same movement
this is a great pleasure
laughing at the protocol johana cross pleased to meet you
then to jacques faking surprise well
isnt this a coincidence
i really wasnt expecting this
all the way out here
please have a seat
i wouldnt want to interrupt anything
johana sits down
not at all
youre staying at the hotel
i wish but its full
they recommended a pension in town
they say that all of taormina is full
whats going on here
its the free diving world championship
i am by the way world champion
johana has turned toward jacques paying no attention to enzo
jacques cant stop looking at johana
but what brought you to sicily
i was doing an insurance investigation in palermo
to enzo i work for an insurance company
back to jacques so i decided to take a few days off
uncomfortable i dont know this island at all
it really is gorgeous
there is no place in the world more beautiful than sicily
the waiter passes behind them
enzo reaches out grabs him by the arm pulls him to the table
to waiter a spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent
smiling i think ill have a coffee
youll like it
enzo pours the wine
johana shrugs fatalistically
the waiter leaves
jacques intrigued stares at johana
she pretends not to notice
impatient where did you two meet
in a lake
i might have known
to johana as i was telling you earlier im the world champion free diver
some people say its the most virile sport in the world
one has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea all muscles contracted in one super human effort
ahi ahi cazzo
god shell kill me
pushing the plate in front of johana if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant
he quickly brushes off the crumbs in front of him
heading toward them
shes a huge woman in widows black
she shoulders her way through the tables
roberto carrying her suitcases follows at her heels
enzo jumps to his feet
throws his arms around her
expressionless you expect me to carry all the luggage myself
roberto and an elevator
isnt that enough
signora molinari inspects the plates on the table
suspiciously what have you been eating
coffee only im diving tomorrow
you remember little jacques jacques mayol
and his friend johana
signora molinari nods grudgingly
arriving proudly spaghetti del mare
enzo is the only one with no plate in front of him
signora molinaris eyebrows condense into a dark stripe across her forehead
johana hands enzos plate to the waiter and takes the full one
to waiter thank you
and begins to eat ignoring the expressions of amazement all around her
johana nods enthusiastically her mouth too full to speak
impressed to johana benvenuto
mamma molinari has a huge grin on her face
they emerge onto the street in front of the entrance of a small rooming house
jacques is carrying johanas luggage
the old pension is covered in bright pink bougainvilliers there is laundry hanging on the other side of the street
thanks for helping with the bag
she looks up at the pension with little enthusiasm it looks great
i thought it was a nice place
suddenly doubting isnt it
im being a pain in the ass
looking at him its beautiful here
they look at each other
jacques is silent
he just stands there a suitcase in each hand
johana breaks the silence
youre going to be very busy these days arent you
i dont know
i would have liked to visit the town
see the coast
i dont know anybody
expect for you
feeling she has gone too far but you are going to be very busy
you must have tons of things to prepare interviews
and a competition like this one must require a great deal of concentration right
shakes his head negatively yes
i dont know
i dont like competitions
it ruins the fun
dont you think
with a faint smile i guess
but you know
im american and ive mostly been taught to be competitive
theres always pleasure of being the best
maybe on earth there is one
but not when you dive
you see to dive deep into the sea for no reason
just to do it
its a feeling
i dont know how to say this
he looks up at her as he pronounces the last word
she smiles at him lovingly
laughing you can put down the suitcases you know
he lets go of the suitcases
suddenly behind them there is a loud screech of tires
the fiat tears across the street
enzo in his fiat
he pokes his head out of the window
cmon you two
jacques we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight
we have a new world champion
im a little tired i dont know if
get in the car
theyre in front of a wardrobe looking jacques over in the full length mirrors
hes wearing an evening shirt and a tuxedo of enzos
the collar is too big the sleeves hangover his hands
he looks at himself dubiously in the mirror
the bow tie
roberto hands enzo the bow tie he hooks it around jacques collar
taking a few steps back very good
jacques looks down at his tennis shoes
what about the shoes
hesitates anyway you dont have anything else do you
then its very chic
a big reception is organized on the terrace of the hotel
the official divers and technicians are all gathered in front of a podium
the terrace is loaded with photographers
roberto keeps turning round and round the long buffet table
jacques is alone at the bar
incongruous detail a whiskey bottle on the table beside him
she has also had a few drinks
i thought youd be at the dinner
its too loud for me
he tugs at his over sized tuxedo
you look adorable
smiling especially the sneakers
jacques looks down at his feet doesnt know what to make of her comment
johana sits down beside him and pours herself a drink
they touch glasses
on the podium novelli the organizer of the championship stands in his tuxedo talking into a microphone
an older man in a worn out suit stands next to him
ladies and gentlemen your attention please
andre bonnet president of the international diving championship committee is going to present this trophy to the new world champion of free diving
this afternoon our new champion descended to the remarkable depth of feet
the audience applauds
this young man tia
novelli cant quite read his notes
andre bonnet takes his turn to read the note
a young tahitian jumps up heads for the podium
novelli hesitates to repeat the name
lets all give him a big hand
the audience cheers and applauds the new champion
enzo sits at a table watching the ceremony
very sarcastic a one day hero
he gets up and walks out of the room
jacques and johana are sitting at the bar
the whiskeys have gone to their heads
enzo walks over to them
a new world record
it gives me something to beat tomorrow
to johana you ever been to tahiti
ill take you there
well live in the sun
youll cook fresh fish and well make love under the coconut trees
johana smiles and shakes her head
you forgot the hula
yes of course ill do the hula
youll be lovely but no thanks
to jacques jacques would you do a native dance for me
i dont know how
jacques leaves the bar
johana watches him go
enzo notices her way of watching him
hes a little jealous
he looks strange doesnt he
like a baby that just learned to walk
have you known him long
we used to live on the same island in greece when we were kids
what was he like when he was little
and skinny very skinny too
that is compared to me
amused i get it enzo you were a superior child
what is it johana
youre so crazy about him you dont see the truth
she doesnt answer
forget it dont think of jacques as a human being
hes from another world
and just where are you from
enzo sits at the grand piano in the corner of the terrace
beethoven was always a favorite of his
jacques very tipsy by now walks over a glass in each hand
he hands enzo a glass then takes off his tennis shoes and sits them neatly on the piano
there is nothing like music
it speaks from the heart
can you tell me why we bother diving in the dark the cold without ever taking the time to breathe
can you tell me why we do it
for the mermaids
enzo smiles moved
my father used to see them everywhere too
but the only one he ever caught was my mother
actually she caught him
today at lunch you asked me if i had any questions
you finally want to know about women
are they whats most important
sometimes they are
what exactly do you want to know
everything about what
enzo grins at jacques and starts playing again
there are now several empty champagne bottles around
they are both quite drunk
enzo is philosophizing
johana is looking for them
so between mamma roberto and the sisters we yell and scream all day long
except with angelica
she just cries
and then finally we all end up kissing
can you explain that to me
jacques cant answer
because thats what love is all about
its a pain in the ass but keeps us together
then in a half dreaming half desperate tone a large and beautiful family
johana walks over to them
we must quit the competition
enzo hits a wrong note on the piano
if we dont
im going to beat you
johana stands next to jacques
with a nervous laugh huh
well listen to him
to johana do you hear that
he looks me in the eye like some fuckin gold fish and says im going to beat you
with a smile thats what hes here for isnt he
listen to her
thats what hes here for
hes here to loose thats what hes here for
first of all im unbeatable
second how old are you
two years younger than you
as i said second of all youre too skinny
youve got tiny lungs
i still dont understand how you can dive without getting sick
the size of the lungs has nothing to do with it
look at me
these arent lungs
how long can you hold your breath
enzo is getting really angry
the drinks have a lot to do with it
impatiently i dont know
longer than you
enzo pulls open his collar and rises
jacques and enzo dive into the pool in their tuxedos
each one carries a beach umbrella in a concrete base to help them stay at the bottom
enzo takes two goblets out of his pocket hands them to jacques
takes a bottle of champagne out of the other pocket and opens it
the cork floats out of the bottle
above on the surface of the pool theres a splash
johana finds a mask on the side of the pool and watches them
her dress is soaked by now
enzo pours champagne
courteous and grave they clink glasses and begin to drink
they have already been underwater longer than a minute
they cant really drink out of the glasses and enzo offers jacques the bottle
jacques studies the label like a connoisseur
he drinks passes the bottle back to enzo
paramedics roll two stretchers toward the elevators at full speed
enzo on one jacques on the other
both men keep throwing up water
the paramedics roll the stretcher toward the bed
johana very worried follows them
take it easy
dont worry hes empty now
he needs sleep thats all
the two men leave the room
johana walks over to the chair and rearranges jacques shirt and jacket which the paramedic had thrown down
jacques looks like hes just had a very rough night
he sits up and grabs the sides of the bed as if he were on a moving boat
johana turns around furious
the ass hole award
well let me tell you its a tie
she walks over to the bed
acting like a pair of two year olds
you could have died in that damn pool
please move slowly youre rocking the boat
smiling lucky i was there to save you
seeing her wet dress you jumped in
only to help the medics i assure you
johana wet walks over to the wet clothes on the chair
she pulls out jacques soaking wallet from one of the jacket pockets
its still here
she tries to wipe it
i want to show you
is it ruined
well water isnt exactly the best thing for pictures
not even for pictures of dolphins
give it to me
johana hands him the photograph
he stares at it looking very sad
worried johana sits down next to him
on the verge of tears my real family
he looks at the picture and cries what kind of man has such a family
she takes the picture out of his hands
he is so upset that johana can hardly help from crying with him
she sits next to him and strokes his hair
im sick of never feeling at home anywhere
johana takes him in her arms
he breaks down
the early morning sun slowly lights up the water
a yacht has left the hotel dock
it is moving out to sea off the coast of taormina
this is the committee boat for the diving competition
on the boat roberto is worried
he checks his watch and finally decides to wake up his brother
enzo is asleep in the fore peak curled up on a coil of line snoring away
he wears his tuxedo jacket over a skimpy bathing suit
enzo wake up
pulled from his dream eh
he gets up on one arm
the medics are looking all over for you
irritated im meditating cant you see
jacques does two hours of yoga before going down
i can take a five minute nap cant i
the boat stops
the anchor is thrown over board
the sailors technicians and officials are getting ready for the competition
today is enzos turn to dive
a man is hooking a plaque indicating the depth feet onto a lead disk which he heaves into the water on a cable
a medic is bending over enzo taking his blood pressure
roberto pulls the tuxedo jacket down
the doctor puts a blood pressure band around enzos upper arm pumps it up
he listens with his stethoscope
molinari im terribly sorry but i cannot allow you to dive in such an advanced state of exhaustion
enzo jumps to his feet grabs the doctor by his lapels lifts him in the air
outraged what do you know about the sea
so you just put your tubes and tin cans away
the sea is mine
i know when she is ready for me and when she isnt
and today she is ready
you dive at your own risk
youre been warned
enzo smiles and pats the doctor on the shoulder
its a large float rigged to the stern of the committee boat
roberto and an assistant help enzo down the swim ladder to the platform
hes wearing a wet suit and fins
he flip flops to the end of the platform
roberto hands him his mask
the goggles are filled with polystyrene to eliminate as much air pressure as possible
only two pinholes to see through
the mask fits tightly over his nose
when enzo puts it on he looks like an astonished insect
enzo breathes faster and faster
roberto holds the wire controlling the weighted diving apparatus
enzo crosses himself takes a last long gulp of air
roberto releases the weight
it sinks and drags enzo down he quickly disappears into the dark water
but this is jacques as he was a child
he swims along the bottom finds and picks up a gold coin
we can see its ancient markings a youth on a dolphin
jacques looks up
in front of him is a dolphin floating vertically still apparently just watching
jacques isnt scared anymore
but every time he swims toward the dolphin it moves further away
it finally disappears
he sits bolt upright in bed awakened by his dream
he looks around the room trying to get his bearings
johana is asleep in a chair across the room
on the wall behind her her last nights dress is drying on a hanger
shes wrapped up in a hotel bathrobe fast asleep
jacques finally awake from his dream sees johana sleeping
he walks over to her touches her shoulder
she wakes up starts out of the chair
she grabs the blanket to cover herself and in doing so a book falls on the floor
its one of his
you scared me
jacques picks up the book
just checking up on your family
then embarrassed i guess i was drunker than i thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress
im glad you stayed
getting up id better get back now
you wouldnt want to spend the day with me
she sits back in her chair amazed that he would even ask
self conscious no
she says no as if she had asked the question yes of course
jacques and johana enter the dolphinarium
johana is wearing an old pair of jacques shorts along with an oversized t shirt and rolled up sweater
she seems quite pleased with her new attire
jacques and johana walk straight through marineland and head toward the dolphin pool
its pretty crowded mostly kids
the dolphins are lying motionless at the bottom of the pool
the trainer is tired of throwing fish in the pool and getting absolutely no reaction
whats the matter
i dont understand
weve tried for two days
they wont eat
they wont perform
its since we got the new one
it thrusts its head over the edge of the pool looks to jacques and speaks
is she the new one
surprised the trainer nods
johana looks over at jacques then at the dolphin
she doesnt understand
how can you tell its a female
the way she moves
three other dolphins gather around the one that jacques is patting
jacques is staring at the female dolphin
it looks like the animal is trying to tell him something
suddenly the dolphin grabs him by the sleeve and pulls him into the pool
jacques hangs onto the dolphins muzzle
lets it pull him along
the dolphin swims to a far corner of the pool and pulls jacques to the bottom
the other dolphins circle above
jacques pops up
as he does three dolphins leap in the air behind him
johana walks closer to the pool
she is so excited by what jacques is doing she finally falls into the pool
after a while jacques gets out of the pool and helps johana out
did you ever think of trying the public pool
hes a dolphin specialist
in that case whats wrong with the new one
is she sick or not
taking his time to answer not the way you mean
what am i supposed to do
do i call the dealer
the investment you understand
i certainly am entitled to complain
its going to cost you more than you think
jacques turns around and walks off
johana catches up with him
shes not like the others
she cant stand to be away from the sea
impressed how do you know that
stopping i dont know i just feel it
jacques and johana are walking across the corridor
enzo walks up to them followed by his tribe
everybody is congratulating him
roberto is screaming mamma molinari is crying
enzo smiles as he talks back to them
he sees jacques
enzo grabs hold of his shoulders
jacques and johana are completely soaked
dont be sad i only took back what was mine
he gives jacques the diving plaque it reads feet
here its a present
johana and jacques smile at each other
jacques has won his bet
touched thank you
enzo slaps him on the shoulder
to johana tonight were having a little party among ourselves
oclock in my suite
enzo walks off then turns back toward them
he whispers in jacques ear
can you explain why you are soaking wet
were in training
enzo walks off
three formally dressed officials are waiting in front of one of the hotel rooms
one of them holds a medal in his hand a glass of champagne in the other
through the door mr
roberto tell your brother to be reasonable
everyone is waiting for him upstairs
the photographers are there the press
he cant hes indisposed
trying to keep his calm shall we call a doctor
no its okay
mamma is going to try something
jacques and johana walk up from the other side of the hall and stop in front of the same door
mayol help us
he refuses to receive his medal and everybody is waiting for him up there
we already have problems with the press because of the danger and if we dont even have the divers help
dubious ill do my best
thats very kind of you
jacques knocks on the door
then enzo opens the door himself
come on in
the officials look at each other baffled
enzo molinari allow me to impress upon you the importance of your attending the award ceremony
for the press
loosing his temper i think my brother told you i was indisposed that should do it no
im allowed to be indisposed right
so you just tell the press that the big enzo molinari overwhelmed by his inspiring descent to feet will not be able to receive this trinket because he is
he looks inquisitively at the three men
enzo looses his temper
because he is
he slams the door in their face
tell me why dont you go and get your medal
because pasta should be eaten al dente
so the trinket will just have to wait a bit
enzo takes jacques by the shoulder
inside his room is absolute chaos dancing singing eating
wet suits hung out to dry everywhere
mamma molinari is whipping up mountains of spaghetti on an improvised stove in the middle of the room
a lot of smoke
all of italy crammed into a few square feet
johana taken in by the warm atmosphere sits in a corner of the room
jacques walks over and sits down at her side
to mamma mamma
she points at roberto who is taking forever to grate the cheese
enzo grabs the guitar from his other brothers hands and starts playing
you go down
you come up
to johana right johana
smiling congratulations enzo
dont you agree jacques
you always were the best
enzo laughs then sees his mother
enzo starts singing in italian
mamma molinari serves the pasta roberto follows her around sprinkling his cheese on the plates
she serves johana a huge plate of pasta enough for three giants
with a smile buon appetito signorina
johana who isnt even hungry grins uncertainly
jacques has walked up to enzo
he doesnt dare ask his question
smiling whats the matter
you still have a bunch of things to ask me
you want to know the price of tea in china of how we landed on the moon
is that it
jacques is serious
no i have to ask you a favor
a beat youre the only one wholl understand
seriously im listening
tutto va bene
the three officials are eating pasta plates on their knees
their mouths are too full to speak they nod enthusiastically
mouth full gracie mille chignora
mamma molinari smiles and slams the door
jacques is driving johana sits beside him
enzo crammed in the back seat very uncomfortably because of a stretcher which takes up all the space
they are dressed as they were at enzos party
leaning forward hey
will you slow down
when did you learn how to drive
driving isnt the problem its remembering the right road
jacques runs a red light
and the lights
running lights stealing stretchers
youll have us in jail
enzo stop bitching will you
they get out of the car
jacques starts to change into his swimming trunks
enzo shakes his head cant believe hes really come along
he laughs and starts undressing
its a very narrow street
the car moves down it quickly
the back seat is now occupied by the dolphin
its nose and tail protruding through the windows
johana is in the front seat turned around spraying the dolphin with a watering can
they have driven to the public beach
they slowly lower the stretcher into the water
the dolphin leaving the stretcher swims around a little but wont go away
he wont leave jacques
moved you cant stay here
jacques swims off with her for a while
enzo walks back toward the car with the stretcher
johana standing by the water looks at jacques and the dolphin who are swimming off together
jacques keeps splashing the dolphin as they swim
you can stop that now she has all the water she needs
jacques cannot get rid of the dolphin
all right we did it
lets go back to the party
jacques and the dolphin cant seem to part
just one minute
johana is worried she walks up to enzo who goes back into the water and takes jacques by the arm
jacques the dolphin is home now
and thats where were going
hurry up now
our girlfriend is freezing over there
the dolphin starts swimming off
jacques follows enzo half heartedly
enzo stops the fiat in front of the pension
the three of them get out
enzo hasnt bothered to dress
johana heads for the gate she obviously has no desire of leaving jacques
well good night then
you going to sleep here all by yourself
she looks over at the pension having a hard time concealing her lack of enthusiasm
its a comfortable place
sinister is what id call it
ours is so much cheerful
why dont you come and stay with me
theres plenty of room in my suite
smiles the mammas there too
face clouds up yes the mamma is is there
good night enzo good night jacques
to jacques you dont need a stretcher to take her with you
you know that dont you
the dolphins arent the only ones who dont feel very good sometimes
leave it alone enzo its okay
she rings the bell for the concierge then looks back at can i come watch you dive tomorrow
yes of course
the concierge comes out and opens the iron gate for her
johana disappears into the parc
enzo turns to jacques
you really do have a few things to learn about women
the sun is rising on a rough sea
the committee boat is anchored in the open sea feet above the sea bed
jacques who is on the foredeck of a boat at sea has just laid a towel down before him
hes suited up sitting in the lotus position staring straight ahead clearly self hypnotized
johana novelli and other officials are in the stern of the boat watching last minute preparations
the scuba divers in brightly colored wetsuits and aqualungs flop out onto the diving platform plunge into the water disappear
what are they for
they wait at feet
just checking if there was a problem they could do something right
of course thats what theyre for
johana sees scuba divers with weird air tanks
pointing and those
those are the divers who go down to feet
they dive with a helium oxygen mixture
at that depth compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide
whats that little air bottle on the machine
that isnt for the divers actually
its for the balloon
it blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator
without it with the pressure at the bottom the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed
shocked but doesnt jacques dive without anything
on the boat novelli checks his watch
jacques comes out of his room
hes dressed to dive
he ignores everyone as he goes down the ladder to the diving platform
he seems to be in another world
all sounds coming to him are drowned out
jacques sits in the divers slot
opens his eyes slowly and looks around
he puts his flippers on an assistant stands at his side
the figures on the platform are vague the voices are garbled and incomprehensible
moving almost in slow motion he raises three fingers
ten other divers have waited for this signal to dive
they disappear one by one into the blue
jacques uses contact lenses instead of a mask
he puts them in and now his view of the world is as distorted as his hearing
already euphoric from the vast amount of oxygen in his system he moves into another reality altogether
seems to empty himself out
jacques fills a small tube with water
pours it into his nostrils
tilts his head
then lets it run out
he puts on his gloves
all his movements are slow he seems to be operating in a different time zone
he seems unable to take his eyes off the water
jacques puts his nose clip on
he puts his hand on the gueuse
closes his eyes and inhales slowly
then he takes a sudden last breath nods the technician releases the gueuse and in one flashing movement he disappears
the gueuse slides down the cable
jacques hangs on like a ribbon in the wind past a marker feet down
above him the boat disappears from sight
he moves faster and faster
through a sea that looks like a cloudy sky
the light fades rapidly around him
below white spotlights pierce an ocean dark as night
jacques reaches them in a matter of seconds
turns the brakes brings his machine to a halt feet down
the medics are waiting for him there
they take his pulse
check his eyes
the bubbles from there scuba tanks churn the water around them
jacques closes his eyes
a tap on the shoulder he releases the brake on the gueuse
plunges further this time into pitch black
below him a faint spotlight glows on the bottom
he reaches it and the dark diver moves to him
jacques brakes his machine
moving very slowly turns his body right side up
like a sleep walker jacques starts to take the plaque off the plumbline
pauses in the middle of the gesture
the dark diver flashes the high sign to jacques thumb and forefinger touching fingers extended all clear
jacques does not respond
the diver repeats the signal
jacques does not respond
the diver taps jacques on the shoulder
and then jacques responds thumb and forefinger touching okay
slowly reluctantly he wraps his hand around the handle of the balloon
the dark diver quickly turns the handle for him
the balloon inflates
jacques hangs on
lets it carry him up
at the plague marking feet jacques lets go of the the balloon
with a burst of speed it darts toward the surface
jacques follows slowly undulating like a fish
hes getting warm now
he closes his eyes
passes the medical control without stopping
without even seeing it like someone asleep
hes moving faster now toward the warmth toward the air
jacques opens his eyes watches the lights grow brighter
the silhouette of the boat comes back into view
feet to go
in slow motion jacques hand holding the plaque breaks out of the water followed by his arm in one continuous movement his shoulders and head
he gasps for air
a trickle of blood comes from his nose
flashbulbs flicker spectators cheer
the dolphin the one rescued last night leaps into the air in perfect harmony with jacques triumph
the dolphins in the dolphinarium leap into the air at the exact same moment
the trainer doesnt understand whats going on
jacques falls back into the water
two divers run over and pull him up onto the dock
jacques seems completely dazed almost in a trance
he slowly comes to and starts screaming louder and louder
it is the scream of his body in need of the surface reality and the feel of the land
johana is terrified
she can hardly breathe
jacques and johana walk down the gangway
novelli has lead the way and the news has been spread
jacques looks very weak and punchy
johana holds him up
the spectators applaud as he goes by
intrigued jacques looks at them all
excited jacques listen to the applause
he doesnt respond
trying to keep up jacques you set a world record
arent you happy
dont you feel proud
i feel proud and all i did was watch
he is staring at her hes returning to the real world
slowly he smiles
she grabs hold of his arm and gives him a proud kiss on the mouth
jacques is a little stunned
enzo walks into the hotel his arms filled with packages
he sees jacques and johana
from the look on his face we can tell he knows that jacques has beaten his record
he deliberately puts on a huge smile as he walks over to them
he drops his packages on the bar and gives jacques a big hug
im happy for you
he kisses him and starts handing out his presents
to jacques here
to johana here
what is it
little presents nothing much
i knew it i just knew it
he holds up his arm he is wearing two watches
i won it
he bet that you couldnt beat me
jacques opens his present
its a little ceramic dolphin
you still collect them
you dont have that one do you
its really beautiful
oh its nothing
i knew it
i told roberto hes very good that little frenchman very good
i lost my title but i won a watch
johana has opened her package
its a big plate with a text engraved on it
is it a poem
no its the recipe for spaghetti frutti del mare
to jacques you see i was right in getting you out here
youre a world champion my friend
jacques has opened the last small package
its a measuring tape
he looks at it without understanding
enzo explains its a measuring tape
he grabs hold of the tape and lets it roll to the ground
you see this is your record three feet more than mine
looking at it from here it doesnt look like much does it
jacques looks at him without saying a word
enzo hands him the measuring tape
keep your little measuring tape my friend it will be a nice souvenir when i beat you next
enzo taps his shoulder and smiles
theyre locked in a long kiss
he untucks the bottom of her shirt and slides his hands under it
theyre in bed making love in their fashion
moonlight shines in the silver sea
in the background are the lights of the bay of taormina
jacques is in bed with johana
they are both asleep
suddenly he sits up as he always does after his recurrent dream
hes wide awake looks over at her sleeping
she sleeps peacefully like a baby
quietly gently he eases out of bed and walks to the open window
he stands on the balcony staring at the sea
then in the distance in the moonlight a dolphin leaps out of the water once twice a third time
jacques laughs and goes back to the bed where he sits down next to johana
she is still sound asleep
jacques quickly gets into one of his diving suits
he puts on his flippers
the dolphin is still jumping in and out of the water
jacques jumps off the pier and swims over to her
johana rolls over and feels the bed in her sleep
jacques absence wakes her
she gets up and walks over to the balcony
she doesnt see anything
johana walks down the pier and notices the little pile of clothes jacques has left behind
she looks around but still cant see anything
she decides to sit next to the pile of clothes and waits her eyes riveted to the sea
the sky has just begun to light up again
johana is still sitting next to the pile of clothes
she is wearing jacques sweater
she looks sad yet serene
the look of a woman who has been thinking over the situation and who has made up her mind
tired jacques swims back to the pier
it looks as if he has come out of nowhere
he is exhausted
he takes off his flippers and gets up onto the pier in front of johana
he looks at her a little surprised to find her there
warm what are you doing here
she answers in a far away voice with the same serene sadness
im going to leave jacques
dripping with water he sits down next to her
his face is drawn from fatigue
im going back home
because one shouldnt fall in love with creatures from the sea
im not from the sea
i dont understand what youre talking about
yes you do
you know exactly what im talking about
youre afraid i want to hold onto you and i do but youre not ready
at least not for me
but its not true i feel good with you
it feels right
she looks at him for a moment then takes his face in her hands and rests it on her bosom as if a small child
ive got to get back to the hotel
and get my suitcase packed
the train station faces the sea
jacques and johana are standing on the platform amid others
in the distance we hear the rumble and whistle of a train
johana gets on the train
the station master blows his whistle
will we see each other again
johanas eyes are filled with tears
take good care of yourself jacques
the train starts pulling out of the station
where can i call you
johana tell me where can i call you
johana doesnt answer
jacques stands helplessly in the station his eyes filled with tears
enzo opens the door of his suite
his hair is messed up hes got sheet prints on his face and is wearing the top of a diving suit
can i come in
no problem i enjoy talking in my sleep
enzo walks back into the apartment and crashes on the bed
hes lying on his stomach
jacques walks in and lets himself drop in a chair
wake me up at
enzo closes his eyes
jacques looks over at the clock it says
jacques doesnt say anything and stares blankly out of the window
opening one eye hmmm
jacques doesnt answer
is it the girl
jacques stares out the window
did she leave
enzo gets up and sits on the side of the bed
im going to take care of you
ive got this job on an oil rig no sweat
im taking you along
get your bags packed
youre coming with me i tell you
he pats him on the back
well make a great team the two of us
the platform shines in the morning light
there are several stories of crew housing and offices above the deck
long steel legs disappear into the swelling slate gray ocean
we hear whop whop whop of a helicopter
the helicopter is landing
crewmen rush to secure it to the oil rigs deck
doors open and two passengers get off jacques and enzo
they each carry a duffel bag of personal belongings
theyre both wearing fluorescent diving suits
the drilling superintendent comes to meet them
weve been waiting for you for three days
is that the way you talk to the best diver in the world
and to his friend jacques mayol
the superintendent smiles sourly and gestures to a crewman
show them their quarters
five minutes later jacques and enzo are following the crewman
whispering he doesnt like us
his job is to hand out the paychecks
and he does that very well let me tell you
the diving capsule suspended by cables begins its descent through a trap door in the deck
it plunges into the sea
the three men in the capsule are jacques enzo and the tough looking capsule commander noireuter who is much too professional for enzos tastes
enzo watches through a porthole while the commander concentrates on the control console
he runs through a checklist of systems
jacques responds with a check as he verifies each one
enzo is already bored and fed up by the procedures
jacques is lost in thought they dont look cheerful
suddenly you still thinking about her
jacques doesnt answer
enzo goes on
dont think about her anymore
let me tell you youre just making yourself unhappy
there are so many women in the world
he takes a cigarette from a pouch in his diving suit and stares at noireuter
plenty of women everywhere right
coldly smoking is absolutely forbidden
it isnt lit yet
you shouldnt even carry cigarettes on board
listen were not supposed to piss either but that doesnt stop you from carrying it on board
stubborn the rules are the rules
checking out this creature whats your name again
and where did you say you were from
i didnt say
enzo smiles sardonically shaking his head very slowly
the commanders answer explains it all
a technician is overlooking the capsule descent on a video screen
the superintendent watches over the technicians shoulder
theyre at feet
enzo a cigarette dangling from his lips looks through the porthole
i was seventeen i loved her so much i tried to die for her
two years later i couldnt even remember her name
let me tell you time erases everything
i dont want to erase anything
youd rather think about it and make yourself miserable
after thinking about it yes
smiles i give you this
dumb but stubborn
taking it as a compliment thank you
the technician fiddles with a few knobs
end of descent
the diving capsule ends its descent
the commander turns to enzo and jacques who is still staring out the porthole
with a mickey mouse voice you have enough air for minutes
enzo bursts out laughing
with donald ducks voice whats with the voice
its just the helium because of the air pressure
does the voice come back
for others yes
for you who knows
still a little worried to jacques try speaking to me
with daffy ducks voice i dont find this funny
we were having a serious conversation
enzo and jacques burst out laughing
they keep these same voice till the end of the scene
enzo pulls out a tiny silver flask out of his pocket
to jacques here give me your finger
enzo taps a drop onto jacques finger then on his own
then noireuter blows up
in a panic is that alcohol
are you out of your mind
alcohol is strictly forbidden
loosing his temper hey
dyou have any other complaints
just make a list and well stick it on the porthole
enzo pours a second drop on his own finger
go on suck your finger
enzo has no qualms about it and sucks his own finger
noireuter is petrified
are you crazy
at this pressure
its very deep down here
come on suck your finger youll be seeing mermaids everywhere
jacques convinced sucks his finger too
the alcohol has an immediate effect on them
to jacques a thousand commanders and we get a belgian from alcoholics anonymous
enzo gets out of the diving capsule head first
he is connected to the capsule by a number of cables
jacques who follows him gets completely tangled up in them
they are both hilariously drunk
the superintendent hears them laughing through the control room speakers
he flips a communication switch
can you hear me
whats going on
to the technician are you sure youre on the right channel
the technician nods back to him
the two divers have gotten to the spot they are supposed to be working on
they have their arms around each other and are dancing
noireuter watches them through the porthole
he shakes his head in complete disbelief
we hear the two friends humming the tune of a viennese waltz
if those guys are playing a radio down there theyd just better watch out
sally is talking away pointing around the apartment
and if we repaint the walls well need new curtains you put the painters on you visa and ill do the curtains on american express
for the couch theres bloomingdales
or are you still over your limit
flatly way past it
does that have a hidden meaning
im just depressed
you look it too
you havent been working out you havent been taking your vitamins
you havent been drinking your herbs you havent been
stopping her i know i know
im a terrible person
after a beat its
im so damn damn sad
what is it honey
tentatively do you think i should have stayed
dont you think maybe i should have stayed
ive been a jerk right
then emphatically i should have stayed
i was supposed to be in love
i was in love
i am in love why did i act like a bitch
he went swimming
all the man did was go swimming
i must be crazy
it was too good to be true
vitamins exercise herb tea
and see a doctor will ya
the doctor enters with a folder speaks to johana well miss cross herbs arent going to do the trick this time
worried its serious right
i think so
if thats in order
johana breaks into a wide grin
its in order
i dont think its me you have to thank
duffy is at his desk
his lunch is spread out in front of him
outside the window the window washers are eating their lunch too
johana hurries in
agitated i came to make a clean breast of everything
the whole business
bluffing with his mouth full of sandwich yes
in a rush remember when i went to italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium
well we werent being cheated by the mafia or anybody except maybe by me
she sees the window washers do they come for lunch everyday
i really went on my own business to see a man that i happen to be in love with
and im glad i did it but im sorry about the policy and ill be happy to make up the money the company didnt get
of course just now i dont have
she checks a note shes holding one million four hundred and ten thousand dollars
but if you were to dock my salary say twenty dollars a week in a few hundred years wed be even
and i think this is where you fire me
swallowing sandwich youre right
will that interfere with my getting maternity leave
the italian i presume
hes french he was just in italy for the competition
smiling he seems to have won it
yes isnt it wonderful
im so happy
ill bet im the happiest pregnant fired person in the world
she starts to leave
calls out to the window washers
bon appetit and adieu
johana stares out of the bay window of her manhattan apartment
hesitant she walks around her telephone
finally she makes up her mind picks up her address book and dials the number
jacques is on the telephone in front of a little window overlooking the sea
he is very glad to hear her voice
how are you
i got fired
i had this job with enzo
we got fired too
johanas face lights up with a huge smile
johana is still on the phone sitting in front of the bay window
day is dawning
looking out at the skyline its getting light out
here its getting dark
she stretches lies down on the carpeted floor
jacques seems to have gone through all topics of conversation
ive been thinking about you a lot you know
johana is by now completely stretched out on the floor
so have i
a beat hello
im still here
well then talk to me some more
its hard you know
youre so far away and i dont know what else to say
then tell me a story
he turns around and sits on the window sill his feet dangling in mid air
he looks at the sea seeking inspiration
do you know how it is
starting again do you know what youre supposed to do to meet a mermaid
with a smile no
you go down to the bottom of the sea where the water isnt even blue anymore where the sky is only a memory
and you float there quietly quietly and stay there
and you decide that you will die for them
only then do they start coming out
they come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them
if its sincere
if its pure
they will be with you and take you away forever
johana listens with the abandon of a child being put to sleep
the sun hits the roof tops
the sea is sparkling
the phone rings on the window sill
its me again
after a silence im being a pain huh
not at all
smiling absolutely positive
in that case
im at the airport in nice
jacques doesnt know what to say
he looks around him cant figure out what to do
huh ill be right over
johana is standing in front of the airport
jacques sees her
they smile shyly at each other
jacques and johana are sitting in the back of a taxi
the driver stops in front of the hotel
loud the carlton
enjoy your siesta
jacques and johana look at each other
the room is in semi darkness despite the blazing sunlight coming through cracks in the shutters
jacques and johana are making love
jacques is on top of her his whole body covered in sweat
the rumpled sheets and the movements of their bodies suggest the movements of the sea
all sounds are disproportionate and slightly distorted they are underwater
all johanas reluctance has vanished
both of them act like people who have never felt anything like this before
a certain astonishment at the depth of their feeling
an increasing freedom
all the muscles of their bodies stretch to their limits
jacques progressively finds himself disappearing
his image dissolves point by point
disintegrates into unbroken blue
the effect creates the impression of someone melting the screen is now totally blue
a thin high pitched sound
from the bottom of the image a tiny pinpoint starts toward the camera
it is jacques naked swimming out of the deep blue ocean toward the light as if he were coming out of a dive
he comes closer and closer to the until his head almost touches the lens
a sudden deafening noise
and we find jacques on top of johana
he looks down at her speechless
a little frightened are you okay
after a long beat
i think i love you
jacques and johana step out of the elevator of a th century building
jacques is carrying her suitcases
why did you take me to the hotel if you live here
jacques rings the door bell and sticks his key in the door
surprised someone in there
jacques nods and pushes the door open with the bags hes carrying
they enter a huge very old apartment filled with models and paintings of boats
jacques leads johana to the other end of the apartment
its a huge old fashioned bathroom
the centerpiece is a deep ancient bathtub on faded gild feet
theres a rippling shadow of a body under the bath water
dont be afraid
its my uncle
he goes to the tub and pinches the end of a tube
uncle louis underwater has been breathing through it
louis head pops out of the water furious
loud as if speaking to a deaf man uncle louis this is my friend johana
did you buy the cassettes
the wagner the berlioz
i brought johana to meet you
are you crazy
i have no use for a woman
since my accident
johana is visiting me
tentatively bonjour monsieur
she looks to jacques whispering to johana uncle louis
hes a year old amazing guy isnt he
im very pleased to meet you uncle louis
to johana did you bring the cassettes the wagner the berlioz
pointing to jacques this idiot never listens to anything i say
sometimes i wonder if he isnt deaf
louis climbs out of the bathtub and pulls on a bathrobe
behind him hes pulling two insulated wires out of the bathtub
we see that theyre connected to small underwater speakers
as they surface incredibly loud music blasts the finale of the overture trumpets timpani cannons etc
the sound fills the room the apartment and probably all of antibes
the three of them are at the table
there are a few scraps on their plates on a threadbare lace tablecloth
incredibly loud symphonic music is playing
louis is as deaf as a fence post
everyone has to scream over the music
where are you from henrietta
correcting him johana
what kind of name is that
to be named after a city
smiling he doesnt hear too well
yelling i said i was from new york
yelling at jacques that explains it
the best lays are from new york
when i was in new york oh boy
to johana before my accident you understand
then back to jacques jacques stands up and lowers the music
impatient uncle louis
johana is my friend
shes come to stay with me for a while
that way ill see more of you
where are you going to stay
outraged in my apartment
with a sigh its my apartment
jumping up liar
when you were an orphan i nursed you at my breast
uncle louis we have a guest
im going to put a lock on the telephone
them calming down to johana did you bring the cassettes
jacques room looks like a diving equipment storage room with a bed in it
jacques notices johanas gaze
solicitously you think itll be all right
youll be comfortable here
catching her breath its going to be
jacques johana and roberto are waiting at the port
glancing at his watch its not like him to be late
of course sometimes he doesnt show up at all
once in capri he
interrupting we get the picture roberto
looks over her shoulder jacques i think louis needs help
jacques turns around
uncle louis is a few yards behind them at a fish stand on the dock
hes holding up an eel and screaming at the fishmonger
yelling two dollars for this
this fish wasnt caught
it died of cancer
jacques shrugs his shoulders and gives up on the idea of interfering
pointing here he comes
a speed boat races along the water
its a beautiful highly varnished mahogany riva
it races into the port
standing at the helm looking like christopher columbus his hair brushed back by the wind is enzo
next to him hanging on to the windscreen is an impressive six foot dark haired beauty
she has a scarf over her hair
she wears a purple leather micro mini with a cerise halter top and her ruby fingernails are three inches long
if she ever actually would get cast in a movie shed make raquel welch hide in shame
her stage name is bonita enzo kills the throttle swings the speedboat into a perfect landing at the dock
roberto takes the lines
during all of this everyones attention is actually on bonita who is tugging at her long black hair
theyre all awestruck except for roberto
meaning the speed boat where did you get that
meaning bonita that
this is not a that
this is bonita mariposa the famous spanish actress
whispering to bonita who is going to be careful with the varnish
back to roberto and who has come to spend a few days with us
and very quickly wheres mamma
checking watch you have eight hours before she gets here
enzo glances at his watch and sighs with relief
bonita says hello to jacques kisses johana
loud classical music booms from the stereo
the noise pins jacques enzo and roberto to their chairs
uncle louis gets a bottle of whiskey and serves everybody
hes really going totally deaf
im not as deaf as you are blind my boy
you take care of your eyes ill take care of my ears
laughing im sorry uncle louis
uncle louis pours him a whiskey
come on drink up my boy
it might just save us from your bullshit
the bottle is empty
uncle louis goes to the kitchen
jacques turns down the music and finally hears the bell which has been ringing
jacques opens the apartment door its professor lawrence
suit and tie and carrying a bottle
im glad you could come
i want you to meet enzo
enzo and lawrence shake hands
with a smile so youre the famous enzo molinari
with an even bigger smile in the flesh
i have that honor
johana comes into the bathroom closes the door cutting down the blaring music
the paint is peeling off the ceiling
bonita is standing under a watt lamp putting on make up in front of jacques cracked shaving mirror
youre going to live here permanently
maybe if jacques will let me fix up the place a little
johana walks over to the mirror and watches bonita put on her make up like a professional
wistfully hes shy not like enzo
not like enzo
putting on eyelashes i think hes really nice
hes a funny guy
sometimes even very moving
after a long silence im pregnant bonita
bonita stops working on her make up and looks pensively at are you going to keep it
does he know
thinking maybe you should talk to him about it
i just dont know how to
bonita looks at her with the same pensive look
johana goes on
i was thinking of something kinda stupid last night
you know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the gods
take leda for example sleeping with jupiter who came to earth as a swan
well can you imagine leda announcing to her swan youre going to be a father my little chick a dee
starts laughing but your man isnt quite a god
smiles probably not but i still dont have the nerve to tell him
well youre going to have to tell him sometime
unconvinced johana nods
she changes the subject
do you love enzo
earnestly very much i think
a beat but theres going to be a problem
the problem mamma molinari sits between enzo and roberto looking like a malevolent storm cloud staring across at bonita
desperately mamma calimari fritti
zuppa de pesci
eyeing bonita nothing
im not hungry
mamma bonita is an actress like sophia loren anna magnani
icy sarah bernardt
i sing too
a hell of a carmen
want to hear
coldly no thank you
theres an interminable awkward silence
then uncle louis at last finds his way to the table
jacques who is too grateful for the interruption springs to his feet
uncle louis you remember enzos mother signora molinari from amorgos
screaming the whale
how could i forget
always was something fishy about that woman
mamma molinari is having trouble breathing
what were italians doing living in greece anyway
louis we were french
whats the matter with you
complete panic mamma pesce di spada
all of them are gasping for air trying so hard not to laugh
to mamma hey whale
can you pass down the squids
they all burst out laughing
the diving platform is out
the competition has begun
enzo is at the gueuse getting ready to dive
roberto works around him busily
bonita on deck above him is making little gestures of encouragement
enzo isnt amused
other competitors watch from the committee boat
enzo turns the handle on the gueuse plunges into the water
professor lawrence taking notes stands a few feet away
he dives down further and further down
he approaches the two medics in aqualungs at the control point feet
they move toward him
assistants help him onto the platform
roberto pulls off his fins
enzo rips off his mask
he looks furious
he tosses the depth plaque which proves he is qualified back into the water
a shit dive
he looks around angrily for an official
those goddamned frogmen doctors waiting around at feet they just kill your concentration
theyre required by law
climbing off platform theres no law down there
the only law is what your lungs can take
to the next diver have fun
they waiting for you down there to take the temperature of your ass
he keeps on walking across the boat runs into jacques whos just about to begin his yoga preparation
jacques sees enzos expression looks concerned
defensively anybody can have a bad day
ive had many
when the sea doesnt want you
disgusted its never the sea
its roberto mamma that stupid actress
jacques what do you know
go do your hindu exercises and dont break my balls
enzo stamps into one of the cabins
johana is reading a child birth catalog
she throws it away upside down as soon as she hears jacques approaching
jacques comes in and sits opposite her
he seems bitter
well how was it
in an involuntary gesture jacques flips through the catalog
sadly enzo had a bad day
johana wonders if jacques will understand the presence of the baby magazine
tense and you
i didnt dive
she takes the magazine youll try again tomorrow
i dont know
it didnt feel right
im going to bed
he goes away
you forgot your magazine
he hasnt heard
jacques goes to the bedroom and throws himself on the bed
johana looks as if she had wished hed put two and two together
enzo bursts out of the water
he rips off his face mask throws it on the diving platform roaring with pleasure
he tosses the depth plague to roberto
let them try
johana opens the apartment door
bonita is standing there a suitcase in one hand
i wanted to say goodbye johana
they kiss each other goodbye
johana is very uncomfortable
she hands her a note could you please give this to enzo
bonita grabs the note back and tears it up
its no use
just tell him i said goodbye
and give him a kiss for me okay
the two women hug again
sorry bonita you shouldnt be discouraged so easily
i dont have the strength to fight off la mamma
anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier
bonita rests her hand on johanas stomach
did you tell him
im waiting for the right moment
you take care of yourself johana
bonita smiles at her and disappears down the stairs
officials novelli lawrence roberto and of course enzo disembark
there is a lot of excitement on the dock
everyone has already heard the news
people swarm around enzo
lawrence spots jacques in the crowd and goes to him
smiling good huh
he really was unbelievable feet deeper than the world record
then eagerly and jacques
he held his breath for four minutes and fifty seconds
smiles too good
i guess i have tomorrows work cut out for me as enzo would say
seriously you must be very careful jacques
at these depths to hold your breath for over five minutes is
youd really be pushing it
i think its very very dangerous
jacques sees enzo being carried past on the shoulders of the crowd
he ignores lawrence runs beside enzo
yelling enzo enzo
in answer to the crowds applause thank you thank you very much
enzo and novelli stand on a little stage facing the crowd
enzo is holding a gold trophy waving to friends in the audience
now im sure youve heard that some people have suggested it is too dangerous for us to continue
dangerous because we dont know how to measure the physiological consequences of this type of dive and also because the scuba divers are not used to going down below feet
while the attentive crowd listens to novelli enzo is gesturing to roberto explaining what appetizers he wants from the cocktail trays
the crowd laughs
but we polled the free divers and they insist that the competition continue
theres wild applause
enzo lifts the trophy over his head smiles like a champ and yells into the microphone
yelling good luck to you all
enzo and roberto are on the front deck watching the divers
a german diver comes up to the surface empty handed
the tahitian comes out of the water in a semi coma
the doctors carry him away
once hes sure that the diver is out of danger enzo smiles again
a whole team of japanese walk over to the diving platform
the team consists of one diver and six assistants three of them playing music to help the diver concentrate
the diver wears a white wet suit with a red circle on his forehead
he is concentrating very hard so much that enzo walks over to him to make sure hes okay
the japanese diver concentrates with such strength that he faints
smiling to his brother fabulous what a dive huh
the diver from the philippines stands at the end of the diving platform
he concentrates for a moment then gives up and walks away
whats the point of knocking yourself out
theyre in bed side by side both of them half asleep
the only light in the room comes from the open windows
he rolls over and watches her sleep looking down at her adoringly
he slips off the chain with the gold coin
slowly holding the chain he runs the coin gently over her body stops at the level of her stomach and lets it rest there
she opens her eyes and looks at him wondering if he senses something
softly what are you doing
im putting you on the coin
that way youll always be with me when i dive
she smiles closes her eyes
he swings the coin over her face gently some kind of private ceremony
she looks just a little intimidated
the coin is now dangling in front of her mouth
she hesitates then opens her mouth jacques lets the coin slide into it
jacques walks up to the diving platform
lawrence has fixed scientific equipment on his chest
jacques wets and slowly puts them on
enzo watches from the deck his expression has changed
johana on the deck also opposite enzo watches a little worried
jacques concentrates then releases the gueuse and lets himself disappear under the water
jacques dives down very fast
the control takes place at feet the doctors check him and let him go
he continues his descent its getting darker and darker around him
the gueuse stops at the level of the underwater platform just below the diver who swims over to him in a sea of bubbles from his oxygen bottles
he asks jacques if he is alright jacques nods and gives him a huge smile before swimming off downwards
the diver realizes and starts after him
he grabs jacques by one of his fins and pulls him back to the round platform
jacques lets go of the balloon
the diver panics
jacques slowly motions that everything is fine and slowly paddles up to the surface
the boats huge stop watch indicates min then then
jacques has been down there for over minutes
johana is worried sick
enzo doesnt know what to make of it and lawrence feels completely helpless
the stopwatch indicates then and jacques half unconscious brakes through the surface of the water
johana screams and cries with joy when she sees him
the crowd applauds
enzo is somber
novelli takes the plaque from jacques hands and turns to the crowd
he dove feet
the crowd cheers in excitement
enzo is sullen
lawrence is very worried
theres a pile of gear on the dock
enzo is in the boat loading one piece of luggage at a time jacques comes up to the boat
parked in the background we see a taxi waiting with johana sitting in the back seat
enzo pretends not to notice jacques arrival
jacques watches him for a moment then finally dares to speak
pointing at taxi theres a party at the hotel tonight
enzo keeps loading up the boat
busy thats good
after a beat enzo dont be angry
i was lucky
enzo throws the last duffel bag into the cockpit
serious ill see you in amorgos
enzo turns around and jumps onto his boat
jacques walks off the dock past the cab
johana opens the door to let him in but he keeps walking
you go back ill walk
he walks off
the park is empty as jacques approaches the pool
tina the dolphin jumps out of the water swims to meet jacques
jacques pats her and kneels to talk to tina sadly i won today
i dove very deep tina
the dolphin giggles
whats so funny
can you dive deeper
the dolphin nods yes
smiling so you understand everything
the dolphin nods
so tell me why theyre all angry at me
why is enzo angry
i never wanted to compete with him
i never wanted to be champion of anything
all i want is to escape from them all
for just a few minutes no people
nothing but the sea
the dolphin nods and giggles
do you really understand me
are we actually having a conversation here
again the dolphin nods yes
all right then tell me can i ever dive as deep as you
stay under as long
then the dolphin nods yes
are you sure
the two other dolphins stick their heads out of the water
they all nod together
jacques is awed and perplexed at the same time
the little town of amorgos is beautiful mountainous
its surrounded by a luminous turquoise sea with white villas clinging to hillsides
there is a small port
we saw it in the opening sequence further along the coast we see the diving federation committee boat surrounded by all sorts of activity
through the open windows we can see parts of the village where jacques grew up
hes staring out the window lost in his own thoughts
its beautiful isnt it
behind him johana is hiding and throwing up
he walks to her
just the long trip
im a little jet lagged
you want to lie down for a while
no ill be fine
can you just hand me a glass of water
while jacques gets her the water johana stares at the view
roberto stands on the port waiting for his brother
suddenly the sound of a motor boat and twelve note horn echoes in the bay
the boat has just arrived at the town dock
enzo tears rolling down his cheeks from the wind throws a duffel bag on the dock and looks up at roberto
is he here
uncomfortable hes training
enzo makes a face
johana sits on the little dock in front of the hotel
jacques pulls on his fins looks out into the water
she clutches a stopwatch ready to set it off
a few yards behind hidden between two bungalows enzo watches them
jacques takes a few deep breaths and dives a few feet underwater
johana starts the stopwatch
enzo who sees jacques disappear walks over to johana and sits down beside her
okay now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk
what are you doing here
checking out the competition
enzo why do you guys do this
teasing what else is there
seriously you know what im talking about
why do you and jacques risk your lives diving
avoiding the question you risk your life when you cross the street
frustrated damn it
why wont you give me a straight answer for once
because youd laugh
i wont i swear
seriously i dive in search of god
if i go deep enough im going to find him
to me the sea is a religion
that surprises you doesnt it
looking down at jacques in the water a little
you think its the same for jacques
shaking his head no
jacques is a creature of the sea
he isnt meant to live on earth among us
you should know this johana
reassuring herself he can learn
he is learning
you really think so
did you tell him you were pregnant
surprised how do you know that
you told bonita but you didnt tell him right
johana shakes her head negatively
because he wont understand and it will just hurt you
jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake
and hes only waiting for one thing that some god up there will turn him into a fish
how long has that moron been down there
looking at the stopwatch five minutes and fifty seconds
grabbing away the stopwatch that idiot
they jump up
enzo dives into the water
as johana watches panicky enzo pulls jacques up onto the dock in his arms
jacques is unconscious
enzo is furious
the fear of loosing his friend has absolutely enraged him
he starts pacing up and down the dock
is he alright
furious the fool was asleep
if i werent around hed already be dead
is that who you want to live with
well good luck
you better learn to look after him because i wont always be here to do it
once again he marches off then comes back
mumbling how long was i asleep
to jacques long enough to die
listen if you really want to die thats your problem but dont do it under my nose okay
a few steps away then coming back
to jacques ill never let you take away my title
dyou hear me
enzo stalks off defiantly
the competition has begun
a series of quick shots of different competitors at various points in their dives
the tahitian comes up unconscious
the german comes up unconscious
so does the diver from the philippines
novelli doesnt know what to think
jacques is in a t shirt and jeans rope sole sandals
johana wears a light white cotton dress
they both sit on the restaurants terrace overlooking the sea
below them a small boat passes
in it are baskets filled with sponges
jacques stares at them for a long time
do you ever sometimes just stop and think how sweet life can be
johana wants to say something
when you dive
with that machine
what does it feel like
after thinking about it the feeling of slipping without falling
the hardest is once you are at the bottom
because you have to find a good reason to come back up again
and i always have a hard time finding one
johana has never looked so sad and lost
jacques doesnt notice
enzo who is sitting at the piano behind them starts to play staring at the sea
jacques and johana turn around and look at him
smiling you should start playing the piano the piano is really refreshing it clears the sinuses
very good the piano
tomorrow is going to be a big day
hes alone in the bow
the others are clustered in the saloon cockpit in the stern
the boat is moving close to the cliffs
the monastery looms above them
hes scanning the apparently abandoned monastery searching for signs of life
a red and blue taxi boat pulls up alongside the committee boat
in it lawrence waits to climb on board
enzo puts his flippers on and grabs his gueuse
he is serious concentrating hard
lawrences boat slides along the big committee boat and the doctor climbs onto it
lawrences briefcase is open
theres a stack of graph paper on a cabin table
when i analyzed the data from mayols last dive it became apparent
taps the graph paper at the depths these men are diving it is a physiological impossibility that they can retain enough oxygen in their blood to make it back to
its a function of how long it takes to get to the bottom orient themselves and to return
to attempt to break mayols record is simple suicide
to novelli for the last time
im telling you cancel the competition
novelli and the medic look over at the diving platform where enzo is concentrating
molinaris a seventeen time world champion
do you want to tell him he cant dive
lawrence doesnt answer
novelli is thinking
get mayol in here
enzo is preparing
he sits at the edge of the platform hyperventilating almost in a trance
we see jacques in the background talking to novelli he then walks over to enzo and climbs down next to him
no response enzo
i know youre angry at me
no response enzo its important
enzo opens one eye
quickly we cant dive anymore
they want to cancel the competition for a while
enzo looks at him coldly
takes another deep breath
rushing on its not safe they say
the doctors say it isnt possible to go deeper and live
free diving is over as a sport
you say that because you have the title
i would never cheat you
well thats very nice of you
he takes a last breath signs himself and reaching for the gueuse disappears into the water
lawrence novelli the medics and others are arguing
lawrence is furious that enzo is diving
novelli is balling out his assistants
jacques is on the platform watching the others as if they were a gaggle of geese
he listens to the sound of the gueuse playing out watches the depth indicator the stopwatches
he knows something is wrong
he walks over to the edge and grabs hold of a little oxygen bottle which is there for security
he takes a few breaths of the oxygen as he puts on his flippers and dives down after enzo
jacques pulls himself down the cable hand over hand
or feet down he sees a group of medics coming toward him carrying enzos unconscious body
jacques struggles with them pushes them away takes enzo in his arms and climbs toward the surface frantic screaming silently at him desperate to get away from the flow of
air bubbles from the scuba tanks the commotion the memory of death
enzo has a big serene smile on his face
the medics push both divers toward the surface
as if they were on land jacques starts shaking enzo to wake him up
he then slaps his face but enzo remains unconscious
they finally break the surface in each others arms
they pull enzo out of the water
the doctors open his jacket
enzo motions to jacques to come close
he still has that long smile
faintly you were right
moved i was right about what
after a long silence it is much better down there
its a better place
he tries to take a deep breath the effort is exhausting
jacques smiles holding back his tears
push me back in the water
crying i cant
jacques take me back down
his smile freezes he stops breathing
his eyes close
jacques puts his head down on his friends chest and sobs
the doctors gently try to move him away but jacques resists
just give him five minutes
what does it matter now anyway
come on just leave him alone
lawrence encourages everybody to leave the platform
jacques quickly grabs the nearest rope and ties it to his belt
before anybody can stop him jacques rolls enzos body back into the water and dives after it
he holds enzo in his arms
lets the dead weight of the body pull him down deeper and deeper
the rope around jacques waist runs out stops his descent with an abrupt jerk
when he feels it jacques lets go
watches as enzos body continues to drift by itself into the bottomless blue
the doctors have run over and are pulling the cable that jacques is attached to
he is unconscious when they pull him up
they hold him up by his feet
jacques throws up gallons of water
they put an oxygen mask on his face
listening to his heartbeat the heart is going to stop
the stimulator quickly
suddenly everything collapses for jacques
the image slows down the light fades
jacques only hears his heartbeat which slows down
his heart stops
among the crowd around him he sees johana fresh gentle smiling
her movements are smooth and slowed down
she smiles at him simply
jacques smiles back
the heart starts again slowly
the image goes back to normal
sounds multiply doctors the panic etc
and slowly come back
jacques falls unconscious
the heart started again
its all right
novelli falls back in his chair relieved
jacques is lying on the bed he has a strong fever
johana sits at his feet
lawrence rummages through a medical kit
he takes a pill from a bottle and gives it to him
have a good sleep
jacques swallows the pills
johana walks over from the balcony
lawrence motions to johana that they should let him sleep
he goes out of the room
tenderly to johana who had started to leave the room kiss me
johana bends over and kisses him
jacques holds her by the arm doesnt want her to leave
well talk later
johana kisses him on the forehead and leaves the room
theyre at the little zinc bar
not talking not really drinking either just toying with their glasses
roberto passes stops
ive packed all of
a beat im going to the radio telephone
swallowing to call mamma
they watch sadly as he leaves
jacques sitting up in bed finally lies down under the sheets
he turns off the light by the bed
theyve moved from the bar to the table
there is uneaten food in front of them
a third place is set
johana looks at the wall clock
ill go see how hes doing
let him sleep
jacques is lying on the bed he is not moving anymore
he is breathing loudly as if tired out
from his pov the room becomes very dark and blue
the noise is unbearable
the ceiling turns into water
jacques eyes are wide open
his face is sweating
the water level from the ceiling comes down to him until he is swallowed by it
as he falls into the water we see a dolphin gulping air at the surface and going back very quickly to the blue
the dolphin meets his group about ten of them kg of muscles swimming at more than km h underwater
they all break through the surface to gulp air regularly
suddenly one of them leaves the group
he crosses the blue and seems to make sonar like sounds
we see a sonar picture
its an image in which the dolphin will appear a few seconds later
the dolphin comes up like a rocket gulps air and goes back down
the sonar image appears again
finally the dolphin locates a group of fish and starts hunting them exactly like a war plane
he manages to break the group in two then in four and this way he isolates his victim
he breaks the surface to gulp air and goes back down
he goes full power
the fish he is after are even more divided
there is only one left totally lost and in a panic
the exhausted fish is swallowed
the dolphin slows down goes back up breaks the surface in slow motion
images becomes pale and bright
he screams inhumanly
image is white black silence
johana opens the shutters
the room is a shamble of broken glass water pitcher and glasses lamps and vases
the windows are blown out
jacques is lying in bed
there is a thin trickle of blood coming from his nose and ears
in a panic jacques
are you alright
jacques jumps into enzos boat
still worried jacques
are you alright
are you alright
she jumps down into enzos boat
he starts the engine
the boat is racing out of the port
johana yells over the sound of the engine
youve got to tell me what happened
i saw how it has to be
jacques parks the boat in front of the committee boats diving platform
he turns on the platform lights above and underwater
he throws down the diving cable feet
jacques gets undressed and sits down in the lotus position concentrating
johana sits down a few feet away and watches him wondering just how far he is going to push this whole thing
as the cable unrolls johana starts crying
she understands that jacques is going to dive to the bottom into the blue into himself
jacques you know i love you
jacques is putting on his flippers and stands facing his gueuse
after a silence dont be sad
its not because of you its me
its all going on inside me
a beat ive gotta go and see
johana starts pacing up and down the diving platform
there is nothing to see
its pitch black down there
youll be all alone
look at me jacques
i am here
she starts waving her arms im real
i am not a dream
jacques will you look at me
she breaks down please
jacques has not moved he still sits motionless facing his gueuse
johana doesnt know what to do or say
she is totally drained
its wonderful for you
you are the father
jacques is petrified without any reaction
he doesnt understand
she realizes its hopeless and stares at the sea
after a while i lied
to keep you here
she kisses him
promise me one thing
promise you wont forget me
she pulls the line releasing the gueuse
jacques takes a deep breath and grabbing hold of the gueuse disappears into the water as if swallowed by the ocean
jacques slides along the cable pulled by the weight of the gueuse
he has a beautiful smile on his face
he is in his element
night has closed in around him
he turns on the headlight of the gueuse it casts a dim light around him
johana has walked over to the edge of the platform
she is holding the cable to hear jacques descent
the counter shows that jacques is quickly passing the feet mark
jacques keeps going down as serene as ever
he has gained a lot of speed
johana holds her face in her hands
the counter indicates that jacques is going very fast
the gueuse jerks to a stop and shakes the cable
jacques turns his body right side up
the counter now indicates a depth of feet
johana has felt the jolt of the cable
she cries her tears and looks down at the water
the headlight on the gueuse illuminates only a few feet around jacques as if he were standing in a circle of light
he stays there patiently floating around and around his cable
as if he were waiting for something
a long form circles the border between the darkness and the light
jacques holds out his hand
a dolphin comes and presses its body against it
two other dolphins come out of the night
jacques watches in amazement
a dolphin lays his muzzle in jacques hand ready to lead him off
jacques lets go of the cable and lets himself be led away
their silhouettes disappear in the deep blue night
