written by richard lagravenese an upstate new york town
a circus is being dismantled
the big top falls and is gathered up by workmen
trucks are being loaded with animals
an elderly man jacob jankowski year old stands alone with a walker in the middle of the empty parking lot
his shirt is stained with sweat as if it took great effort for him to get there
as he watches the circus disappear jacob looks lost bewildered and fragile
charlie s circus manager and russ a tattooed teen with rings through his eyebrows approach him with a wheelchair
excuse me sir can we help you
no reply from jacob did you miss your ride
i missed the spec
yes im afraid you did
can we call someone for you
whered it all go
hes seriously old
did you come with the folks from the retirement home
no i came on my own
lets go inside and we can call them to pick you up
charlie motions for russ to get jacob in the wheelchair
no i told ya i came on my own and im not going back

as if talking to a child its ok
were gonna call the home so they can come pick you up
why dont you pick some of those rings out ya head maybe you wont be so stupid ya dumb little shit
sir we need to get you out of this parking lot
my trucks have to come through here
he offers the wheelchair
jacob relents and sits
i got it russ
take the walker
finish closing up the ticket booth
russ takes the walker and exits as charlie wheels jacob
in my day they had old timers in the ticket wicket and freaks like him in the sideshow
damn kid didnt even know what the spec was
you sound like you know circuses
charlie checks his watch impatient to get jacob home
i was on two
calling os to trucks malcolm tell them to come through
patronizing to jacob two circuses
wow thats something
ringling of course but that was later
ill need your name when i call the home
first one was called benzini brothers most spectacular show
charlie suddenly stops upon hearing that name
wait a minute
did you say you were with the benzini brothers
youre saying you were there for the
i was in the middle of it
i dont believe this
after the hartford fire and the hagenback wallace wreck thats the most famous circus disaster of all time
i remember it like yesterday
better cause i dont remember yesterday
charlie obrien the third
jacob jankowski the only
jankowski i would be honored if you would have a drink with me in my trailer
a bottle of expensive laphroaig scotch sits on the table
charlie pours them each a shot
it feels good
to the scotch ah i remember you
camel wouldve loved this stuff
camels drink scotch
jacob laughs shaking his head no
charlie pours another you really got here on youre own
the great escape
but i got lost
i should call the home let them know where you are
i dont know why they call it a home
you dont know anybody there
they fill you so full of drugs you dont care
five kids and not one has a place for me since their mother died
they take turns visiting me on weekends
they forgot whose turn it was today so nobody showed up
i had a life ya know
a big life
it isnt right
changes the subject
so how did the benzini brothers stampede start
the story is two guys got thrown off the train and no point in telling a story if all you want to know is the end
from the beginning
now lets see
well everything began the same day everything ended
ha isnt that how it always works
a mirrored medicine cabinet closes revealing the reflection of jacob jankowski years old handsome full of energy
it was a big day
my final exams
jacob bounds down the stairs and into the kitchen
jacobs mother and father are finishing up breakfast
the father tunes a philco radio while smoking a pipe
the mother pours coffee wearing a cardigan sweater and pearls
late for class jacob grabs a piece of bread and bacon and downs a coffee as his mother sweetly scolds him in polish
his father says something supportive in polish as well
jacob thanks him in polish
he kisses his mother and exits
a simple clapboard house in a middle class neighborhood
jacob runs out passing his fathers sign on the front lawn doctor of veterinary medicine the beautiful campus of cornell university
after six years of dissections castrations foalings and shoving my arm up a cows ass more times than i cared to remember i was finally going to graduate cornell in
i was summa cum laude
ha ha and the oldest male virgin on campus
jacob sits beside a beautiful blonde who distracts him with her legs
she notices him staring crosses her legs and smooths her skirt
veterinary sciences final exams is written on the board of a lecture hall
the proctor announces from his desk
you may begin
jacob the blonde and fifty other students open their exam booklets and begin under the proctors supervision
i had my whole life planned
i knew exactly where it was taking me
and then with the opening of a door it all vanished
the lecture hall door opens and dean wilkins enters
the dean walks to the proctor and they confer privately
may we have a word
fifty pairs of eyes turn to look at jacob who looks up
jacob steps outside with dean wilkins
jacob its your parents
im afraid theres been a car accident
jacob walks down a dimly lit hall with a police chief and a chaplain to the morgue led by a nurse
we follow them inside
the room is windowless and bare except for two gurneys each with a sheet covered body
a coroner stands between them
jacob sees a steel table upon which lay his parents belongings wedding rings pearl necklace his fathers pipe
are you ready
the chaplain places a comforting hand on jacobs shoulder
the coroner exposes first jacobs father then jacobs mother
we see only jacobs expression is there any other family to call
jacob in a black suit
hyde is seated opposite him
i know this is difficult for you but theres been no mistake
the house and all their assets including your fathers practise are now property of the bank in default of the mortgage
but im telling you my father put away every penny he ever earned
they owned that house outright
why would he have a mortgage
my guess is because he let people pay him in beans eggs or whatever they had instead of money
and so hes penalized for not turning away people who couldnt afford his help
he was a doctor
yes i know he was a very good man but in banking terms in the reality of what makes this world actually function he was an irresponsible man
im sorry but you oughta to know the truth
this depression is going to last for a long while
and the only ones who will be standing at the end of it are the ones who fight to take what they need to survive
everyone else is going to disappear
dont make the same mistakes as your father
jacob is disturbed by this description of his father
jacob in his black suit walking home
looks up ahead to see all the family possessions are on the lawn being scoured over by strangers fathers philco radio mothers jewelry
a foreclosure sign hangs beside his fathers business sign things happened so fast my head was spinning
and that mortgage
i just couldnt figure it out
a delivery truck pulls up at the curb
it is met by a bank representative who receives a package and carries it to jacob meeting him halfway
this just came for you jacob
whatever it is im going to have to include in the banks report of assets
i also have documents to sign
the bank representative continues mos as jacob opens the package i didnt believe the lawyer or the bank
my mother worked
they had savings
we were never broke
so why would they need a mortgage
and then it hit me
jacob opens the package revealing a brand new sign reading
they did it to pay for my ivy league education
for a moment jacob cant move
this thought stuns him
with his house being picked apart and the bank representative speaking about papers jacob cant take it any longer
he drops the sign and walks away
the bank rep calls after him jacob
jacob they need these signed by the end of the business day
jacob walks away from the bank rep pulling off his tie and tossing it
he is crying the reality finally hitting him
i walked and i kept on walking
its a strange feeling becoming an orphan the same time youre becoming a man
to have this freedom to be anything you want at the same time everything you were is taken away
so i just walked then all of a sudden i stopped
jacob stands with his feet in a clear stream
he is no longer crying
there are dense woods pitch black all around him
like id been sleepwalking and i woke up
i had no idea where i was
jacob can hear the buzz of insects the glow of fireflies and the cries of distant animals in the woods
it unnerves him
far off beyond the dense woods jacob sees a moving flickering light like a distant silent star moving past the trees
the light is moving around the woods until it curves towards jacobs direction
he hears a distant clank clank
curious jacob puts his shoes on and walks back to a gravel path that leads to train tracks just as jacob is so close he is hit by a wall
of wind that nearly knocks him down
it is dark and the train is moving fast
what is it inside of us makes us decide to grab onto life again and again no matter how many times it abandons us without a second thought
what is it makes us hungry for more of the same
somebody smart should figure that one out
jacob makes his decision he runs parallel to the train
stumbling over gravel pitching forward and losing his balance recovering then running faster scanning for something to grab hold of to hoist himself up
he sees an open stock car is three cars behind him
as it catches up to him he lunges forward reaching for the iron grab hold and flings himself upward
he clings on with his left leg elbow and chin
his right hand clings to the grab hold
with his left hand he claws the floorboards of the stock car but the aged wood scraps off under his fingers
his right leg is dangling beneath the train itself dangerously close to the tracks
jacob is slipping
with everything hes got jacob makes one final life or death effort managing to get his left knee up over the edge
using foot knee chin elbow and fingernails he scrapes his way inside the stock car and lies panting
a dim light barely illuminates the interior
jacob breaths a brief sigh of relief and accomplishment when suddenly a huge jacob swings at this brute with his free arm but its blocked easily as the brute moves
him to the open car door
oh dont go messin with blackie
throwing people off of trains is one of the perks of his job
jacob can now see three men playing cards by a kerosene lamp
one man has a rifle aimed at jacob
another a shrunken stubble faced old timer drinks out of a jug
blackie holds jacob out on the edge of the open stock car as trees slam against the train almost cutting jacobs face
we dont need no bums on this train brother
you can get off right now and keep running
old timer rises with a lantern and hobbles on one bad leg inspects jacob and his nice suit with the lantern
now everybody calm down here
grady put that damn rifle away
blackie letim go
and i mean on the inside of the train
jacob struggles as blackie pins one arm behind him
im tellin ya ya cant red light him we dont need that trouble
look at them clothes hes no bum
blackie scans jacobs clothes then tosses him inside the train and returns to the card game
jacob pants relieved
dont be sore kid
its more like a reflex with blackie
and that theres grady
nice to meet you
youre pretty young for the rails
you running from something boy
you on the lam
nothing like that
where you headed
i dont know
no shame in it
what can you do
about anything i guess
camel gives him the once over look then offers the jug
we land in deposit in the morning
well find you some work
and if youre still alive by the end of it ill get you some food and take you to uncle august
jacob drinks and chokes on the liquor
lord and master of the known and unknown universes
jacob looks baffled
camel laughs as he drinks more oh kid dont tell me you didnt notice
grady and bill laugh though blackie remains un amused
ha he really dont know
you didnt just jump a train boy
you jumped the flying squadron of the benzini brothers most spectacular show on earth
you done landed your ass on a circus kid
pre lap the circus train brakes screeching to a halt
jacob is rolled awake as the train stops
he is disoriented as blackie grady and bill jump out through the open stock car door
camel is fast asleep drunk from the jug
the train has stopped adjacent to a huge grassy lot
beyond it the scattered buildings of deposit ny backlit by dawn
jacob jumps out of the stock car in awe of what he sees hundreds of dirty unshaven men pouring out of the train like ants on candy
the wagons of the train are painted scarlet red with gold trim and sunburst wheels
emblazoned on each wagon benzini brothers most spectacular show on earth
jacob wanders as the circus is being created canvas tents are raised the big top laying sprawled on the ground
men standing over seams lacing pieces together
eight man sledge teams pound stakes into the ground at breakneck speed
teams of men are raising enormous poles with their combined weight chanting pull it
now down stake it
several teams horses pulling wagons are charging right for jacob
jacob jumps out of the way nearly being run down
he is out of place
in the way of this finely tuned machine
jacob ducks into a large tent for safety
a stillness takes the place of the chaos outside the translucent tent is as tall as the sky
it has barely been set up just the tent and jacob is in awe
camels llamas zebras and horses stand behind low ropes slung between iron stakes some with their heads in mounds of hay
two giraffes stand within a chain link fence
lions tigers panthers jaguars bears chimps and an orangutan
the animals stop moving as if to give jacob an acknowledgement
jacob responds with a nod or a smile
the orangutan is stretching its arm outside its den for something out of reach
jacob tries to understand
what is it
what do you want
the orangutan strains its arm
blinking at him
jacob looks around and sees a half squashed orange on the ground in front of the cage
he picks it up
jacob opens the den and hands the orangutan the orange
she takes it and sets it on the floor of her den
she returns and reaches out for jacob again
jacob hesitates not knowing what she wants
but deciding to trust her jacob extends his hand to hers
the orangutan wraps her long fingers around jacobs hand and holds it for a beat looking to his face
jacob returns the gaze realizing she is thanking him
he is touched
youre welcome maam
the orangutan lets go and returns to the orange in her den
what the hell you doing in here
get outta there
you aint a menagerie man
only menagerie men is allowed in there
jacob runs out to camel
camel escorts jacob through the grounds to a baggage car
gonna try to get you set up with crazy joe
do i call him crazy joe
it has been said crazy joe went to prison for killing a man who spit into the wind and hit the back of joes neck
so no i would not call this man crazy joe to his face
camel and jacob walks on to an open stock car door where crazy joe stands a burly man missing three fingers
i got a first of may here
think you can use him
crazy joe scans jacob shoots an oyster of dark brown tobacco juice then disappears back inside
camel tells jacob youre in kid
jacob and another young man wade with their shirts off are shovelling tons of horse manure
jacob is queasy blinking from the stench
the young man doesnt seem bothered
ive never seen so much manure
baggage stock horses
they packem in a car
how do you stand the smell
jacob and several other flying squadron men struggle to pull on cables hoisting up the canvases on the big top
it takes a tremendous effort
jacob uses every bit of strength
when the big top is raised jacob cant help but be impressed with the accomplishment as the local townsfolk rubes cheer
jacob struggles to shovel llama manure out of the menagerie
he checks his hands they are blistered and bleeding
cecil the barker is speechifying from a platform beside the sideshow entrance strutting back and forth as a crowd gathers
jacob and other working men including wade are positioned around the perimeter of the crowd
when cecil gives the signal ya gotta push the rubes in towards the entrance but without them catching on or else theyll be a fight
jacob wade and the other men position themselves equidistant around the perimeter of the crowd facing cecil
when cecil pulls his ear the signal
jacob and the other men move forward inching the crowd into the sideshow tents
jacob shovels yak manure more easily having taped his blistered hands
grady hands jacob a long lead pipe
stand inside the tent and smack the sides with this when you see a head trying to peek in without paying
jacob follows grady into the tent
jacob enters and is paralyzed by what he sees camera angles behind barbara a topless woman on stage alone in front of rows of ogling men as she maneuvers her
breasts in circles flipping the tassels attached to them
the men hoot and holler for more as barbara smiles encouragingly hiding her routine boredom
jacob is paralyzed by the sight of a naked woman
grady frantically motions for jacob to snap out of it and use the pipe at the heads sneaking under the tent to peek in
startled out of his enthrallment jacob lifts the pipe too quickly and hits his own forehead
then proceeds to do his job banging the heads thru the flaps
jacob shovels zebra manure no longer affected by the scent
by this point the menagerie tent has been fully installed ten chandeliers hang and twinkle from the roof illuminating the a gloriously bannered candy stand in the tents center
jacob hears someone entering the menagerie
he turns to see
behind the rows of beautiful black and white horses jacob catches flashes of pink sequins
pink sequined gloves of a woman caressing and whispering to them
she is marlena
her shimmering eyes and hair
her porcelain skin
her pink sequins make her glisten and sparkle
jacob is spellbound as he watches marlenas gift with horses marlena uses signals with her whip or clicking sounds with her tongue to communicate with the horses they line up
at her subtle command they raise their hooves they bow down to her rise up on their hind legs
she clicks her tongue and one white silver maned horse lifts a hoof for her to inspect
she clicks for him to take a step
jacob notices the silver maned horse walks tenderly on the foot
he decides to help
approaching the shimmering marlena jacob looks like hes been shovelling shit all day
excuse me maam
marlena doesnt respond
she looks at him with suspicion
he may be foundering
jacob also clicks his tongue as he glides his hands up silver stars fetlock
to marlenas surprise the horse trusts jacob lifting its hoof
jacob examines it
he should be all right for tonight
but id put him on stall rest as soon as possible
he clicks his tongue and eases the hoof down
marlena looks both impressed and insulted
marlena does not
she clicks and assembles her horses in formation then leads them out of the menagerie
jacob looks after her adoringly
camera follows jacob into the big top
jacob arrives as we reveal jacob can barely contain himself
the audience young and old is captivated
faces of poor depression era townspeople light up with joy and amazement during jacobs lines we see clowns jugglers acrobats exotic animals marlena with her horses high divers on fire
diving into a tank of water
it is truly spectacular you never saw anything like it
you could hardly take it all in without fearing you might go blind from the shine
from one kind of world too hard to bear came some kind a heaven no one knew existed
end on jacob seeing marlena gloriously atop her horses who form a tableau as a curtain of sparks falls behind them
the big top drops
horses men and equipment dismantle the great city of tents
and then just as quickly heaven was packed away and gone
as the train travels a worn out jacob sits cramped under a bunk beside a contortionist taking up little space
jacob voraciously eats a plate of food camel snuck in for him
you like the food
you deserve it
you done good i hear
woah you better take a breath before it all comes back up on ya
have a hit of jake
he offers jacob his jake
jacob drinks and chokes
its an acquired taste
now get yourself outta there
im gonna take you in to see august
as jacob squeezes out the contortionist unwinds himself and takes up more space
but its the middle of the night
only time circus people live when they dont have to work
camel leads jacob through various sleeping cars revealing the lowly conditions of life on the road
wooden bunks no private space one bathroom for a dozen to share
the musicians car men smoking cleaning instruments
looking at jacob with suspicion and wry humor
the trumpet player plays taps
jacob doesnt understand why
i got a son about your age
lives outside of reading pa
havent seen him for years
fix your shirt there
jacob shoves in his shirt
he likes the kid
the clown car clowns without make up reading or playing cards
they look at jacob as if he were walking the last mile
one clown waves goodbye
remember when you meet august let him do the talking and dont ever mention ringling
he hates them bastards worse than the depression
barbara and the coochie girls car girls in various forms of undress negligees sheer robes
barbara exits a bathroom and bumps into jacob who fumbles seeing her half nude hows your pipe kid
camel leads the slack jawed jacob away
slightly more upscale and private quarters with a passenger aisle outside individual doors and windows
hey camel whos that woman who works the horses
now stop right there
she dont talk to nobody and you dont talk to her
and dont mention her to august
aint no right way to talk about somebodys wife and make it sound like a compliment
camel takes this opportunity to drink some jake and ask look kid before we do this i gotta ask
i aint tryin to know your business but i do know you aint been on the road too long
youre too clean your clothes too nice and you dont got a possession on you
see a man on the road collects little things
its not a big life i can tell ya
so before you start i ask if you got any kind of life to go back to thats what you should do
he tries to not sound emotional when he says i dont
camel studies him as if understanding what isnt said
i am sorry to hear that
they move on
they reach a platform facing the fanciest car yet
standing upon it is an enormous muscular bald man earl
this heres earl
hes gonna take you in
earl this heres jacob
shakes hands w camel i dont know how to thank you
you may not want to after you been on a show long as i have
good luck to ya kid
camel exits os
alone with earl jacob asks do i look ok
then with one hand earl slides back the door and with the other hand violently grabs jacob by the neck and throws him head first into the car
jacob falls into uncle augusts opulent private car with wood panelling cushioned furniture and chandeliers
sitting at a table playing cards are cecil the barker diamond joe menagerie and ring stock mr
erwin talent booker crazy joe baggage stock and with his back to us in a high wing back chair uncle august rosenbluth
earl shoves him against the wall dangling him off the floor
as august speaks to jacob all we see is the back of his head and smoke from his cigar as he plays cards throughout
that stowaway the old drunk took under his wing
jacob tries to explain but earl bangs him against the wall
to the game ill see your three and raise you five
i dont believe ive had the pleasure
jacob jankowski sir
and what is a jacob jankowski and why he is on my train
just looking for work sir
can you fly
set yourself on fire
ever worked a show son
ever been to a show
jacob sensing where this is going gets augusts attention
august stops playing cards
the others react with sudden apprehension
earl casually shakes his head to warn jacob
august finally rises and turns to camera handsome charismatic fiercely intelligent
matinee idol looks that mask a darker nature
ringling you say
but it was terrible
have you seen our show
what was your favorite act
jacob sees a circus poster with marlena and her horses
the one with the black and white horses
and the girl in pink
ah our star attraction
well i believe were looking for a boy to carry water for the elephants arent we diamond joe
we dont have an eleph shut up
i would do that sir
id like to work with the animals
august and the others chuckle
jacob doesnt understand why
august crosses to jacob as he ridicules and youd carry water for elephants
you have any idea how much water an elephant drinks kid
never met a college man yet who knew his own ass from shinola
you eat my food and you ride my train like youre entitled to survive
but you see nothing survives here without my permission
maybe if you tell me youre nothing ill let you stay although my bet is you wont last
jacob refuses to let august demean him
he stays silent
you smell like every kind of shit
why would a college boy want that
times are hard for everybody
and i guess because
out of all the dirt and sweat and shit and working with fellas you dont want to be caught dead meeting in the daylight comes
so much beauty
we think august and the men are moved by jacobs words
thats beautifully put
toss him off earl
and make sure you see the red light before you red light him
as earl drags jacob in tow august derides him to the others another sonny boy mad at mommy and daddy for paying the bills
sounds like he studied poetry
i got no use for people who rhyme
shouts as he is dragged it was veterinary science
and i can tell you one thing that star attraction horse of yours wont be walking in a few days let alone performing center ring
august stops and turns
earl stops with jacob
now all the men are intrigued
earl stops with jacob may i ask what school
youre a cornell graduate
jacob lies and nods
august wonders whether to trust jacob
marlena did want a vet to take a look at silver star
he worked the rubes for me this afternoon
he shovelled horse shit
dont make him a horse doctor
august looks reluctant
until jacob caps it i hear ringling has its own vet
the other men cant believe jacob spoke up like this
but it amuses august who faces him and smiles all right cornell
come with me
august leads jacob out
august and jacob exit onto the platform
are you sure footed jacob jankowski
i believe so
without missing a beat august leans forward catches hold of something around the side of the car and disappears
the train jerks a curve
jacob almost falls
jacob looks up to see august is on the roof of the train his face moonlit his hair blowing wildly in the wind
he points downward
jacob none too pleased advances to the edge of the platform as the train speeds by and looks where august is pointing he can see the edge of a thin
he wipes his hands on his thighs
jacobs right hand meets the ladder
his left grasps wildly until it ensnares the other side
his feet jam into the rungs
jacob climbs to the roof
august gives jacob a hand up and they sit cross legged
its a breath taking sight isnt it
always gets me
i cant get a new liberty horse mid season
so you make sure this horse performs and the jobs yours
nine bucks a week
if you cross me ill feed you to my meat eaters and there wont be a trace left of you
jacob hangs on every word
you do right by me jacob jankowski
ill show you what its like to travel every inch of this country every inch of this world and be welcomed home in every street be loved in every town
ill give you a life most suckers cant dream of
jacob is mesmerized by august
august stands and tap dances across the roofs
jacob has no choice but to follow
the two men dance and leap atop the train from car to car across the moving train
jacob grows increasingly confident and euphoric following augusts exultant lead
august drops into the ring stock car followed by jacob
on one side is a line of marlenas black and white show horses
the other side there is a makeshift door
august kicks through the door revealing a small room this makeshift room is lit by a kerosene lamp on a crate next to a cot propped up by a wall
a dwarf kinko walter is reading on his cot
he has red hair
he and august greet each other with polite disgust
this is jacob
hes going to bunk with you a while
how do you do
what is he
i said his name is jacob
i asked what not who
hes going to help out in the menagerie
a menagerie man
performers dont bunk with working men
theres a growl from his loyal russell terrier queenie
well there are performers
his hand indicates high and then there are performers
his hand indicates lower kinko standard considering we used to keep the goats in here im sure marlenas horses out there object to now sharing their quarters with you
of course i can always change that and send you back to a bottom bunk with the other kinkers who sorely miss your sunny personality and affectionate camaraderie
kinko knows this threat this gentleman is the shows new veterinarian ivy league no less which puts him a good deal higher than you in my estimation
perhaps youd like to offer him your cot
as the kerosene lamp light flickers in augusts face kinko knows he has no choice
august smiles and turns to leave
ill find you in the morning
sleep well cornell
jacob is left staring at resentful kinko and queenie who snarls at him
jacob tries to be friendly a jack russell
theyre very smart
queenie jumps at jacob growling hunch backed
jacob is pressed against the wall
kinko returns to his book
youre not getting the cot
jacob is washing himself with dirty water out of a bucket beside camel
camel starts hitting his leg
he laughs ha this gam of mine keeps falling asleep on me
pretty soon the only place for me is going to be selling tickets but im too ugly for that
camel straightens up when august appears clearly on his guard
he turns his back to continue washing
we can do better than this for our new vet
ill arrange for you to start getting your own water bucket like the performers and bosses
two buckets per person
august walks away as jacob hurries to follow
see ya camel
sips his jake yeah take care kid
august and jacob enter a more upscale tent where male performers are washing from personal buckets of water
youll need new clothes too
ill set you up with the monday man
what day of the week did your mother hang out the wash to dry
he takes other peoples clothes
its the depression cornell
where have you been
oh right cornell
kinko is bathing with his two buckets when august snatches one of them away
here use kinkos second bucket for now
you barely use up one
jacob tries to placate
august its all right ill if you need a razor there are some back there with my name on them
august walks away
jacob follows august away from kinko
when august stops jacob is caught off guard
its good to have an educated man like you around
i need one other sane individual in this operation
thank you for everything august
august pats his back and exits
jacob heads for the bucket
august wants jacob to follow him to the horse
jacob thought he was going to bathe
jacob follows behind augusts commanding stride
diamond joe and greg a ring stock man in overalls are leading the marlenas horses out of the ring stock car
im sure its nothing serious
dont tell my wife i said this but she coddles them too much
she has a particularly strong affection for silver star
i dont encourage it
its unhealthy to love an animal that much
here she is
marlena runs up to them still in her bed clothes robe
darling meet jacob jankowski benzini brothers own veterinarian
its a pleasure to meet you
marlena barely acknowledges jacob keeping their previous meeting a secret for which jacob is grateful
august puts his arm around her and they kiss
lead the way doc
they enter the ring stock car
jacob marlena and august arrive at the stall to see silver star is laying down
he is breathing heavily his rib cage rising and falling
jacob immediately senses the worst
jesus marlena he wasnt this bad in the show
jacob moves to examine the horse but he flinches in pain
marlena takes over by sitting besides silver stars head and stroking his head while singing a soft lullaby
jacob registers marlenas soothing effect causes silver star to relax
his breathing grows calmer
so jacob begins to examine him as marlena watches protectively
jacob runs his right hand down the leg to the fetlock
he lays his hand on the hoof then place his thumb and forefinger on the back of the fetlock
he looks at the sole of the hoof which is bulging and dark with a red line around the edge
jacobs expression tells us this is a bad sign
is that the problem
do you need any hoof testers
diamond joe has them
well how are you going to fix it
marlena looks at him coolly expecting an explanation
jacob doesnt want to tell her the truth
jacob looks to august and rises leaving marlena with the horse
jacob pulls august away to whisper
i didnt want to say anything in front of
hes already foundering
this horse isnt getting back on his feet august
if there was anything i could do i would but were going to have to put him down
im real sorry
augusts stares at jacob or rather stares through him
a dead stare that lasts just a beat or two too long
and then just as suddenly the look is gone i know you are
come with me
jacob doesnt know what this means
two buckets filled with putrid meat
flies buzzing on top
diamond joe finishes filling the buckets as august grabs one
joe bad report for silver star im afraid
jacob here says theres no hope
were going to have to put him down
diamond joe registers a concerned anxious look to jacob
so i need you to round up pete and greg get a wagon and a harness stretcher
he has to be hauled
a harness what
jacob and ill take care of the cats
well meet you back at the stall
grab the other bucket will you
diamond joe seems uneasy about this as we follow august and jacob who comments on the putrid meat
august this stuff has gone off
do the cats really eat this
no they really love goats
jacob looks to him were all out of goats
jacob waits with the buckets outside the car
august is inside unlocking the padlocks then reappears and jumps out
they get a bucket each
apprehensive jacob hops up
august hands him the buckets
the cat dens have two compartments to the left is a pair of lions
to the right a tiger and a panther
all are massive
as soon as jacob appears they lift their heads ominously
august has unlocked the dens but left the padlock hanging on the cage bars
the animals can smell the buckets now
jacob is a bit unhinged what do i do just open the door and toss it in
unless you think a formal sit down is appropriate
jacob approaches the tiger first
the six hundred pound cat rises then roars his massive head hitting the cage and rattling the lose padlock
why dont you start with rex
thats him on the left
august is pointing to one of the lions with a ratty mane and visible rib cage
smaller than the tiger jacob has a bit more nerve
he reaches for a bucket
august suddenly shouts unnerving jacob even more not that one that one
he points to a difference bucket
jacob can see no difference between them but no matter
he lifts the bucket and approaches the lions cage
rex the lion lunges at the den door
whats the matter
didnt they cover this in school
august is having a grand time
rex is rubbing his mangy coat against the cage bars
jacob fumbles removing the padlock and laying it at his feet
he lifts the bucket and waits
when rex turns away from the cage door jacob swings it open
but before he can spill out the contents of the bucket rex turns and chomps his huge jaw down on jacobs arm
the bucket drops spilling the entrails inside which cause rex to release jacobs arm and attack the food
jacob slams the cage shut and checks to see if he has an arm
he does but it is dripping with saliva and as red as if hed dipped it in boiling water
but no skin is broken
august is hysterically laughing
furious jacob storms off what the hell is wrong with you
you think thats funny
yes i do
aw jacob wait
dont be sore
i was having a little fun
i could have lost my arm
rex hasnt got any teeth
jacob feels more foolish and walks away when just as quickly augusts tone of voice turns darker jacob
jacob stops and turns
august isnt laughing any more
he has that snipers stare of augusts darker side
august moves towards jacob almost menacingly as he speaks
people want their money back when the star act on the poster isnt in the ring
a star attraction keeps a circus alive
without it animals eat that and men eat nothing
it takes time to find and train another horse so without silver star i have no star act
i dont know how hes been performing august but you dont have a star act now
that horse cant walk and if he does youll lose him
hes in a lot of pain
august squeezes jacobs sore arm from rexs attack
jacob cries out in pain as august holds his grip yet speaks calmly we always have choices jacob a choice between our pain and someone elses
that horse was performing before you came and he will continue to perform until he drops dead
im telling you to keep it alive and thats what youll do or youll be red lit like anyone else who doesnt obey the law here
every nation has its own laws under god jacob
you left america the second you jumped my train
i like you
believe me i do
im only thinking of your future
august lets go of his arm and walks away
jacob is angry
angry jacob inspects his arm swollen and red from rexs mouth
he hears o
murmuring coming from silver stars stall
he approaches to find marlena sitting at silver stars head stroking his nose and humming the lullaby
marlena strokes silver star as jacob appears
and marlena speaks to him for the first time
tell me the truth
whats wrong with him
jacob hesitates before answering then the connective tissues between the hoof and the coffin bone are compromised and the coffin bone rotates toward the sole of the hoof
if he keeps walking itll puncture through
hes in a lot of pain
and if he rests
youll lose him anyway
marlena breaths in this bad news and braces herself tears welling up in her eyes
then you have to put him down
jacob is impressed by her
and a little surprised
its the right thing to do
but august wont let you
then if im the shows vet then its my decision isnt it
but august wont like it
then itll be my last decision
marlena is impressed by jacob
she doesnt quite know what to make of him
a determined pent up jacob marches towards bill and grady who are taking a break smoking
camel is drinking jake
what are you doing on the wrong side of the tracks
i need a gun
it cant be that bad
they laugh but jacob insists boldly
i need a gun
or a rifle
grady leans inside the open car door and gets him a rifle
jacob takes it and marches back
they watch him curiously
jacob passes blackie on the way and boldly ignores his intimidating stance
performers and workmen sense a drama brewing and follow jacob to see what is happening
jacob jumps into the ring stock car with the rifle as kinko exits his room with queenie
what do you think youre doing
both of you
jacob continues on to silver star and marlena
you should go
ill keep him calm
jacob respects marlenas fortitude
jacob raises the rifle and aims trembling
stoic marlena tears in her eyes turns her face away
jacob pauses upset
jacobs distraught expression tells us everything as the rifle slides to his side
he looks to marlena
this is their first moment of intimacy
she rises and takes the rifle from his grip
she sees his arm bruised from the cats
she seems to know what it means
she offers a respectful farewell
ill be sorry to see you go mr
she exits o
with the rifle
the yaks are motionless
flies buzz around their head and ears
jacob swats them away
the polar bear is on his stomach breathing heavily
jacob smooths his coat
jacob leans down and hoists a bucket of ice scattering the ice near the polar bear who rolls closer to it
jacob sees rex lying on his side in his cage panting with thirst
he brings a bucket of water to rexs cage and opens it
rex gets to his feet but this time jacob doesnt flinch
he isnt frightened
he gives rex the bucket of water
rex drinks as jacob strokes his mane which rex allows
august calmly enters the menagerie with the rifle
he walks to the center and stops staring at jacob
jacob goes about caring for the animals moving from one to the next trying not to be unnerved by augusts presence
then august does a surprising thing he sits in the center of the menagerie crossed legged with the rifle beside him
youve got a gift for them
like marlena with horses
its god given
i can always spot it
jacob takes bobo out of his den
bobo hugs him tightly
he continues on as he replies my father used to say that to me
he must have been a wise man
this stops jacob
he turns to august
how is marlena
august tilts his head curiously with a smile
youre a genuine curiosity jacob jankowski
what am i to do with you
i threaten to throw you off a moving train feed you to my lions and you go ahead and shoot my star horse anyway
so i think jacobs an educated man
for jacob to disobey me and shoot that horse that horse must have been in pretty bad shape
perhaps bad enough to injure my marlena during the show
and so i think jacob jankowski might be a valuable person to have around
tell diamond joe the animals need more water when the humiditys this bad if i dont see him before i go
youre not going anywhere
you belong here
theyve been waiting for you
jacob doesnt know whether to believe him or not
then but dont ever disobey me like that again
ill give you this one
ill call it respect
next one i call betrayal
i do thank you though
you and silver star solved a much bigger problem for me
august pulls a pack of camels from his pocket
august lights inhales blows smoke then
you see meat eaters are always more valuable to a circus than hay burners
and you saw what we had to feed them
what does silver star have to do with the cats
we should have just enough food for them to get us to the next show thanks to you
of course marlena wont speak to me for a day or two but shell come around
so i was right
you are a valuable man
as he walks away rifle over his arm jacob is unnerved august what did you do
kinko reads comic book porn inside a book of aristotles poetics
jacob sits on his bed thinking
i couldnt stop thinking about marlena
i didnt see her for three days
our shows were cancelled and we kept moving because word was august found a dead one
the train wheels screech as it begins to stop
jacob rises and looks out of open train car doors
the train is pulling into the site of a ghost town abandoned circus a dilapidated big top broken wagons and tents desolate performers walking about idly or sitting in the
as the train pulls into goshen performers stick their heads out the window to see
jacob sits in the open stock car with kinko and queenie
why are we stopping
august loves his sideshow freaks
theres a guy with this outfit who has a parasitic twin growing out of his chest
he dresses it in a tiny tuxedo and black patent leather shoes
no talent but a real money maker with the rubes
calls himself the man and a half
goddamn augustll pay him double what he pays me just for the irony
what happened to this circus
went belly up
pretty common nowadays
circus bosses see the end coming and theyd pull a runner with all the money
menagerie belongs to the town now
august can get anything he wants for a song
jacob and kinko watch august striding through the grounds as desperate performers hopeful for work rush up to him
most of them will never belong to another show
and they know it
august is helped by earl who pushes the performers aside so august can head straight for the goshen town officials standing beside an oldsmobile
they exchange greetings
crazy joe is organizing the flying squadron to take whatever parts of the fox circus remains that they can use
jacob is checking baggage stock horses when he sees marlena sitting alone outside her stateroom
he walks to her
just as he reaches her marlena turns to him looking as if she hadnt slept in days
before they can speak they hear
a deliriously happy august is walking and holding the champagne pouring glasses held by earl who then hands one each to marlena jacob diamond joe and crazy joe as they
all walk towards the fox bros
we have a new star
the man and a half
nah lousy ringling got here first
but we got better
a bull elephant
her name is rosie shes fifty three and shes brilliant
the best bull they had
im going to come up with a whole new star act around her and marlena
you can ride her in the spec from now on since we have no liberty horse
august smiles at marlena who looks back contemptuously upset about silver star
august ignores her
jacob notices the exchange between them
pours himself a glass
our own bull
ringling cant hold that over us now
im renovating an entire car just for her
just for the elephant
but the bunkers are at capacity
ive got roustabouts three to a bunk
august tosses off this concern
well find places for everyone
and when our new star sells tickets well buy another car
were a show to be reckoned with now
camera pov dozens of benzini brothers work men are dismantling and taking what they need
as our characters walk through this crowd of working men in constant motion part the way to reveal rosie the elephant she is gargantuan
ten feet tall at the shoulder
her skin is mottled and cracked from the tip of her trunk down to her feet
only her ears are smooth
she has deeply set amber eyes with extremely long lashes
she stands tall behind a rope chained to a stake in the ground
jacob marlena august diamond joe and greg observe her
she has such long eye lashes
shes a hundred if shes a day
were lucky if she can move
darling what do you think
shes magnificent isnt she
marlena keeps her rage silent but it is all the more potent
august decides to ignore it
jacob keeps his eyes on rosie but feels the tension between them
rosies caretaker approaches filthy shirt behind suspenders
you the bull man
refers to diamond joe this is my menagerie man
wheres your bull man
ya got no bull man i gotta tell the township or else they cant sell her to ya
august grabs jacobs arm and shoves him forward here he is
hes my bull man
rosies caretaker looks at the surprised jacob then all right
see this animal
this heres the stupidest goddamn animal on the face of gods good earth
heres your bull hook
youre gonna need it
he tosses a bull hook a wooden rod about three feet long with a four inch metal pick coming off the end to jacob
i dont believe it
the mayor said she was the best bull you had
if she was the best bull why is she the only one left
you think youre the first show to turn up picking on the bones
august is annoyed
as the caretaker gathers his things some elephant tramp who dropped dead in genesee sold her for a song which still aint no bargain cause she aint done a damn
thing since but eat everything in sight
starts to walk away well good luck to ya
and if i dont ever see another dumb bull in my life itll be too soon
rosie pulls her trunk from the trough
she lifts aims and blasts the caretaker with such a force his hat sails off his head in a stream of water
jacob august diamond joe and greg bite their lips from laughing
marlena just stares into rosies eyes
the caretaker stops his hair and clothes dripping
he doesnt turn just stands still for a moment then moves on
augusts enthusiasm is slightly dampened
joe you and greg come with me
we have to find a car to renovate
see what you can do with her
jacob and marlena are left alone with rosie as flying squadron men continue to work in the tent
there is an awkward pause between them
rosenbluth i hope im not speaking out of turn here but but i had no idea they were going to do that to silver star
this relaxes jacob but he senses she is still sad
and please call me marlena
im not a snob like everybody thinks
he faces rosie and tries to cheer marlena up
hello rosie im jacob jankowski
this is mrs
can you say mrs
marlena smiles as she watches jacob stroke rosies hide
youre a beauty huh
skins a little dry you oughta take care of that
first thing you notice about a womans age is her skin
rosie lifts her trunk and begins to explore jacobs body
jacob plays it up to make her laugh
are you flirting with me young lady
i usually like to make the first move
her trunk taps his head i like to get to know a girl first
take her out
meet her folks
her trunk goes lower of course aggressive women can be a nice change
she tickles him jacob and marlena laugh her mood lightened because of jacob
i think you two are engaged
jacob is thrilled to have this effect on marlena
a harmonica plays a tune in the distance
they turn towards the sound and see that the two of them are alone in the tent
all the workmen have left
jacob and marlena turn back to rosie who stands between them
there is a awkward lovely moment of intimacy between the three as marlena strokes rosies trunk
her hand and jacobs come very close to overlapping
when their eyes meet one of them quickly averts their glance
there is clearly a growing attraction between them
but its uncomfortable
i think rosie likes music
that harmonica song is lovely
im confessin that i love you
marlena stops her face flushed by jacobs confession
the name of the song
im confessin that i love you
overlaps realizing confessin that i love you
jacob tries not to laugh
they return to stroking rosie trying not to look at each other
kinko is on his bed reading his aristotle but quickly shuts the book
queenie growls at jacob
kinko returns to his book
jacob sees a new bed roll and pillow upon which sits a letter
he reads it jacob looks up to find kinko staring at him
what is it
its trouble thats what
not that i give a damn but youre playing with dynamite with those two and youre gonna blow all of us up
august is the meanest sonofabitch ive ever met
i admit he has his moments of insanity but hes really a very generous charming guy
you dont get it do you
when august feeds your arm to a lion thats the real august
the one whos generous and charming thats the insane august
they hear a fight outside the car
they move to investigate jacob and kinko look out of the open ring stock car to see august is standing before a man who is being held by blackies men
and punched by blackie himself
the man is bleeding and bruised
various other performers and working men also watch the brutality
six men got red lit last night
cancelling shows and that damn elephant cost august
he needed to clean house to save on payroll
its a lousy day when an animal gets paid and men dont
why are they beating him
he hid one of the men who was supposed to be tossed
word was the train was over a trestle instead of land
nobody comes back from that
get rid of him
he comes back on my property you can shoot him
august walks away with earl and his men in tow
blackie and his men drag the beaten man away
as they turn jacob recognizes the man it is wade who worked jacob on his first day
august wearing a tuxedo opens the door on the platform
come in come in
jacob enters their stateroom which takes up half the car with an additional room cordoned off by a velvet curtain
the main room is paneled in walnut and outfitted with damask furniture a dinette and a pullman kitchen
darling our guest has arrived
jacobs eyes go wide upon seeing marlena who appears looking radiant in a rose silk off the shoulder evening dress
im so glad you could come
would you like a beer
im not dressed for champagne
we can fix that cant we darling
august winks at marlena who giggles at their secret as august ushers jacob to the velvet curtain
were celebrating our new star rosie
my plan is to have the act ready for the manhattan jersey show so she can start selling tickets
unfortunately we had to let some men go last night
jacob listens to how august will explain this i dont like doing it not one bit
but to keep hard working men working i had to get rid of lay abouts and thieves who are dead weight
if i had the funds to pay them all i would but times being as they are
i regret it though
jacob believes him
august turns to him with cheer so tomorrow my faithful bull man we begin
but tonight we dine
tonight we all deserve champagne
august whisks the velvet curtain aside ta dah
a tuxedo for jacob who smiles impressed
three white gloved waiters remove the domes off of silver platters revealing oyster bisque prime rib boiled potatoes asparagus in cream
marlenas dress barely covers her shoulders exposing her porcelain skin and the curves of her breasts
jacob can barely keep his eyes off of her during dinner
jacob is wiping his plate clean as august proudly offers more
marlena laughs at jacobs embarrassment when he realizes his plate is clean
wine is poured over and over
as the evening continues
august is at the center of conversation entertaining marlena and jacob
they are drunk from the wine
jacob i want to apologize to you in front of my darling marlena so she can witness how truly sorry i am for any bit of nastiness between us
running this show the many pressures
it can get the best of me sometimes im afraid
people dont realize how much august does holding everything together
how difficult it is in these times
the whole company is like a family to him
thank you my love
he kisses her hand then turns to jacob from now on i shall trust your judgement in all things veterinarian
please say you accept my apology
jacob is enamoured with august again especially seeing marlena smiling in agreement
of course i do august
youve been nothing but swell to me
i could truly use a friend i can trust
jacob once again beams at the compliment as august pours more wine
but jacob feels a twinge of guilt
he stands to make a dramatic statement
august and marlena look up to him
i have to tell you something
you may not trust me after you hear it
august and marlena pause giving jacob their attention
i never took my final exams at cornell
im not a real vet
then august and marlena burst into laughter at the dire earnestness with which jacob made his statement
but its true
i never got my degree
im not a licensed vet
they laugh even harder
a worthless piece of paper from the ivy bush league
of course youre a vet
you have the gift
youre idealism is just so
when are you going to learn that the rules written of by and for these united states of suckers do not apply to us
not about this august
all right let me ask you do you honestly think this is the most spectacular show on earth
then laughs no
its nowhere near
lucinda our fat lady isnt pounds
four at the tops
and you really think the tattooed man got tattooed by headhunters in borneo
hes from pittsburgh
took him nine years to ink himself
and you know what i did when the hippo died
swapped out her water for formaldehyde and kept showing her
for two weeks we travelled with a pickled hippo
jacob marlena laugh the world is run on tricks in here and out there
so trust me its having a talent that counts
in this world its all thats real
look at this country these dead god awful towns we play
talent and illusion bringing life to what is dead
even for just a matinee
how wonderful is that
jacob believes hes right
marlena smiles in agreement
august rises to toast
jacob and marlena follow
to talent and illusion
and silver star
august takes a beat and smiles warmly at marlena
to all we love
he leans over and kisses marlena longer than appropriate in front of a guest
jacob downs his wine closing his eyes
suddenly august grabs jacob and marlena and pulls them up to dance throwing his arm around them both as we hear louis armstrongs dream a little dream of me
august starts singing along imitating satchmos voice encouraging jacob to join in
august is a great performer filling up the space with his impersonation
jacob can only laugh along
come on jacob
its customary to sing for your supper
jacob joins in to perform with august
marlena applauds them
august breaks away to dance with marlena as jacob sings
they begin to slow dance very intimately
jacob gives up singing and plops himself on an upholstered chair drinking more champagne
jacob watches them dance
he looked like a different man when he looked at her
i said to myself maybe love does that to a man
i didnt know much about it
suddenly august kisses marlena a bit too aggressively
we have a guest
august stares at her
his expression darkens locking his eyes on marlena and tilting his head as if he is examining her
marlena smiles and strokes his face
august doesnt respond
he remains intense
darling what is it
august takes her face by the chin and tilts it with complete control as if searching for proof of something he cant trust
his grip tightens hurting her
alerted jacob sits up prepared to intervene
but marlena shows no sign of fear
she knows exactly what to do
she manages to moves his hand to her mouth and kisses it
you dont know your own strength my love
and then just as quickly augusts expression softens relaxes almost into sadness
as if hes about to cry
marlena senses it immediately
she whispers lovingly
august stops and eyes the bed beyond them
he leaves marlena and throws himself face first on the bed
excuse me jacob
jacob watches as marlena attends to august lifting his legs onto the bed taking off his shoes
august begins snoring
marlena smooths the hair out of his face then closes the curtains and returns to jacob in the main room
is everything all right
marlena puts a finger to lip and keeps it there as she returns to her victrola and selects another record
she cranks it on and plays it low
a ruth etting song
hes just had too much to drink thats all
i hope you had a good time tonight
i wanted so much to make things up to you
tonight was your idea
oh auggie wanted it too he felt horrible about what happened
he really does like you jacob
but its hard for him
hes under a lot of pressure
he does more than people realize holding things together
you said that
well its true
opens her arms to him
one dance before you go
jacob cautiously approaches
marlena takes his hands but when jacob presses closely against her and places his hand against her bare back he almost swoons
they slow dance
jankowski is polish isnt it
is that all right
yes of course sorry
i just think its interesting
i dont know what i am besides augusts wife
i grew up in foster homes since i was a baby
kentucky oklahoma kansas texas
i must have covered a dozen states by the time i was
id make up stories about who my parents were
when i was five i pretended for a whole year my mother was an appaloosa mare
they both laugh
and i pretended that i was really an appaloosa filly
and that i was just dreaming i was a girl and one day id wake up
and id run home
anyway i was a lot safer inside those stables than i ever was inside those homes
marlena stops not wanting to continue
jacob finds a new route for her conversation
what happened at
there was a parade for the circus
at the head there were six black fresians hands high wearing red tassles
and august was leading them
the second he looked at me the way he looked at me i knew id never live with strangers again
and the way he talked
told me id find a home in every city
welcomed in every town
and hed give me a life most suckers cant dream of
ha you too huh
its a wonderful lie isnt it
but he said hed make me a star attraction and he did
im pretty lucky he found me
jacob lost in her eyes and her voice blurts out he was pretty lucky to find you
marlena is surprised by the compliment
youre sweet to say so
feeling exposed jacob searches to change the subject pretty song
dont tell him what happened
jacob takes this as an intimate moment between them
oh no marlena i wont ever tell
marlena smiles laughs using jacobs joke back on him thats the name of the song
dont tell him what happened to me
shes one of my favorites
jacobs head starts spinning
marlena takes care of him are you much of a wine drinker
i have no idea
maybe you should go to bed
jacobs bow tie is undone she ties it
here let me
we cant let you go out there all untied
a circus is a small town
what will people say
as marlena ties his tie jacobs eyes simply rest on marlenas face sinking deeper in love
when marlena finishes she looks up to jacob
she can tell jacob is enamoured
she smiles warmly touching his cheek
sweet sweet jacob
im not that sweet
lowers her hand good night
marlena turns and disappears behind the velvet curtain
jacob stands still for a moment then exits
a drunk jacob sees the ring stock car door open filled with peoples legs hanging out and loud voices from within
jacob hops up into the car
kinko is giving a party with a bottle in his hand and drunken hospitality on his face
thirty performers cram the area usually occupied by marlenas horses including barbara and another coochie girl nell
kinko and queenie are performing tricks
he admires the talent and humor of kinko and queenies act
at the end the girls laugh and applaud
jacob joins in but the sound of jacobs voice immediately makes queenie stop and growl at him
kinko barbara and the coochie girls stop laughing and stare the drunken young man with his shirt out of his pants
he is ripe for the picking
they get an idea
jacob my friend
folks this is my friend and roommate jacob
id like you all to make him feel at home
kinko starts laughing uncontrollably and before jacob can protest or escape barbara and nell approach him moving in for the kill
blurry eyed jacob staggers back but the others refuse to let him leave
in fact he is picked up bodily raised above their heads and transported to silver stars empty stall as barbara and nell disrobe him
kinko opens the lid of a trunk speaking to someone inside where am i
kinko moves about a car filled with racks of costumes props and an open trunk containing the hidden jacob
where are you right now or where are you in an aristotelean context because right now youre in a trunk
inside the trunk o
jacob lifts his arm to camera and discovers he is dressed in a red silk dressing gown
where are my clothes
im not wearing anything underneath this huh huh
as jacob struggles out of the trunk we only see his arms
what the hell did i do last night
you threw up on barbara
and maybe nell
i feel sick
you look a little pale
kinko holds the mirror to jacob
we see for the first time jacob races through each car past musicians clowns and the coochie girls clutching his robe rubbing the make up off
along the way the circus company taunt and tease him with sexy hoots and hollers
kinko follows him delighted
having cleaned up jacob is dressing in his own clothes
kinko sits on his cot reading shakespeare with a melancholy queenie at his side
when jacob scratches his shaven balls
your balls itchy
pissed off jacob continues to dress
itll grow back
aw come on you still store about last night
now i figure were even
in fact i probably owe you one
feel free to borrow a book
lets just drop it
kinko opens a book to read
jacob notices queenies quiet
whats wrong with queenie
what do you mean wrong
i mean shes not hating me
concerned pets her yeah shes been like this all day
i dont know
she must have eaten something
she did her business and it was kind of
did you look at it for parasites
i dont like looking at my own
get some honey from the cookhouse
and if you can find any slippery elm powder
but the honey should do it
if not well check her for parasites
jacob starts to exit
as kinko reads his book jacob
he moves to exit again
kinko never looks up from book jacob
my real names walter
they never look at each other but a friendship is formed
when jacob hops out he sees performers and roustabouts all gathered by a performer train car huddling and discussing
he crosses to investigate meeting up with august diamond joe and mr
we got big trouble
now weve got no center ring star act and no sideshow star
how did she die
i dont know where were gonna find a fat lady this late in the season
i dont care where you find one but find one
to diamond joe better get some kind of rig set up to lift her out of the car
how did you carry silver star out
considers for a second mmmm
no no of course dont be silly
well figure something else out joe but get it down for the performance
put her in the hippo tank for now
you better start on that elephant
we need her performing yesterday
out of the darkness of her car the enormous elephant emerges being led down a ramp by jacob
jacob cleaned dressed and hung over sits crossed legged in front of rosie
the two stare at each other
rosies nose searching the ground for something to eat
jacob without energy or focus his head pounding orders her rosie
rosie just looks at him without moving
rosies trunk starts to sniff around jacob
rosies trunk investigates jacobs body tapping his head
my hair hurts
rosies trunk snakes around him
no more cracker jack until you do something
rosie curls her trunk around jacob and slowly topples him sideways turning him over as he weakly threatens im getting really mad now
i mean it
rosie gets the cracker jack from his back pocket
you just cant get enough of somebody in your pants can you
jacob quickly gets up as august strides towards him
heard you had a rough night
does everybody know what happened
can somebody tell me
august suppresses a laugh
im opening the midway and the menagerie this afternoon for some extra cash before the show tomorrow night
well see how she does with the crowd
she got any skills
but i dont really know how to do this
well first of all you cant do anything with a bull without the bull hook
august takes the bull hook from the ground
its the only way to train them
jacob steps back
august stabs rosie behind the shoulder
rosie lifts her foot a little
august keeps jabbing her with the hook
dotting her flesh with blood
jacob gets upset
august theres got to be another way
we dont have the time
she has to start earning her keep move
august stabs her other shoulder
continuing to shout
rosie is getting agitated
pulling away from him but constrained by her chain
her eyes fearful
other performers rehearsing in the area begin to watch as august strikes rosie harder and harder
she begins to bleed
jacob tries to stop august by going for the bull hook
please august let me try again
but august angrily pulls it away and turns on jacob dont tell me my business
you dont want to watch this get the hell out
making love to it aint going to work
besides from what i hear youre not that good at it
jacob watches upset and furious at augusts treatment
rosies flesh is dotted with wounds from augusts bull hook
jacob is applying zinc ointment to them
im so sorry girl
just a few more here
the un staked canvas flaps behind rosie wave up with the breeze
rosies trunk rises
she smells something from outside the tent
when jacob bends down for more ointment rosie tries to turn around but her chain is still staked into the ground
as jacob straightens up he sees rosies trunk carefully wrap itself around the stake and pull it up out of the ground
she then manages to turn herself around her butt to jacob
rosies trunk then dives down and up under the canvas flaps
a vat of lemonade left on the concession stand which is in the process of being dismantled
work men are carrying items back to the train
we see rosies trunk come out from under the canvas her body hidden searching for the lemonade
jacob peers out to see rosies trunk dip itself into the vat of lemonade and drink the entire contents
jacob is amazed
he looks around workmen are some distance away loading the train
no one else sees her
rosie finishes then turns back into the menagerie
rosies trunk gathers up the stake and then stakes it back into the ground
jacob cant believe his eyes
as the train travels to weekhawken new jersey
jacob is looking out of open car to nyc skyline across the river
we were on our way to the manhattan jersey show and mr
erwin still hadnt found a fat lady
tickets sales were low
so august ha ha
august pulled a hat trick
august is sitting atop rosie smiling waving his top hat then forlornly placing it against his chest and lowering his head in respect for lucinda
manhattan is in the distance
a parade like you never saw a funeral and a celebration saying goodbye to one star introducing a new one
playing those rubes dying to get a peek like he was rolling a coin over his finger tips
rosie leads a small parade of clowns including walter and a perky healthy queenie down the main street
marlena sits atop a percheron in full costume
jacob walks astride
lucindas wagon carrying the dead lucinda follows
it wasnt really lucinda in there
it was barbara in a fat suit and wig inside the hippo den
we buried the real lucinda by the railroad tracks between towns
cemeteries cost too much
we were the only family she knew
people line up to cheer and offer their silent respects
and satisfy a ghoulish fascination at the dead fat lady
august sure was right about rosie
she pulled the people right in
rosie played that crowd like a pro
the rubes love the exotic rosie
kids run up to pet her with their parents
as rosie passes we see an old woman standing in front of her green shuttered house waving with delight
we see she has a abundant vegetable garden which rosie eyes covertly
we hear the band playing from inside the big top as the performers and ring stock are lined up for the grand spec
but as soon as the spec started we all knew it was too soon for rosies debut
rosie heads the line
marlena sits atop her in her sequins and headdress grabbing onto rosies leather halter
august stands beside with the bull hook
his face is cold and still
his fingers clutch and release the bull hook
the spec music begins and everyone makes last minute adjustments
kinko and queenie included
august shouts into rosies ear
rosie hesitates so august strikes her right shoulder with the bull hook
the pain sends rosie flying through the big top flap causing marlena to adeptly flatten her back atop rosie so as not to hit her head on the pole that
runs across the big top flap
others gasp at the near accident
august is already furious
jacob senses danger ahead
he follows in curling the edge of the sidewall so as not to impede the spec performers
jacob watches as rosie makes it twenty feet down the hippodrome track then stops
without missing a beat marlena yanks herself upright beams a smile and thrusts her hands in the air her back arched her toes pointed as if it were all a
part of the act
the crowd goes wild clapping throwing peanuts whistling
rosie only moves in fits and starts causing the rest of the spec to pass them by at times
she trots ahead of august and then when august reaches her she stops making august halt awkwardly
august feels humiliated until the crowd laughs thinking its the act
august realizes the crowd loves it
so august the performer starts to play the infuriated fool to the audience acting comically angry and frustrated with rosie
but when he turns back to rosie he is red faced with real anger poking under her shoulders with the bull hook
after three stops and starts august plunges the bull hook sharply into her shoulder blade
and rosie takes off at a faster speed curling her trunk in the air
the crowd cheers
marlena grasps rosies halter as they fast approach the dangerous pole above the entrance
if marlena doesnt bail shell be knocked off by the pole
jacob august the spec and the audience watch enthralled as rosie charges toward the entrance
when suddenly marlena lets go of the halter and leans hard to the left
just as rosie bolts out of the big top marlena grabs hold of the pole above the entrance and is left hanging there as rosie exits the big top
for a moment the audience doesnt know if this is part of the act
jacob wants to run to help her
but marlena quickly decides what to do she lets go of the pole with her left hand and quickly swings around so she is facing the audience still hanging from
her face lights up and she points to her toes
the band leader takes this as a signal and conducts the band into a drum roll
the crowd relaxes and applauds
marlena begins swinging gaining momentum as the band roll mounts
soon in one final burst of performance inspiration she releases herself from the pole sails through the air tucking her body into a ball rolling twice uncurling for one sideways
rotation and lands firmly in the sawdust in her feet
she straightens up and thrusts her arms in the air
the crowd goes wild
the band plays victory music
coins are thrown from the bleachers
even the spec performers cheer
august acknowledges the audiences response by bowing as if it were all his creation
but after a moment jacob can see marlena is in pain as she turns and subtly limps out of the big top
he follows her
jacob rushes to her
marlena in pain collapses in his arms
august rushes out and is stopped cold by the sight of marlena in jacobs arms
he immediately tenses up
august shes hurt
august takes her in his arms
barbara appears to help
im here darling ive got you
bring her to my tent its closer
jacob send joe for ice
you go and find that goddamn bull before were run out town
and take the hook
august is seething his expression cold as he carries marlena o
jacob concerned takes the hook and runs o
rosie is standing in a vegetable garden calmly feeding herself cabbages
the owner is the old woman who was delighted by rosie in the parade
she is now screaming hitting her with a small garden shovel
jacob runs up
im sorry maam
ill get her
you better before she gets at my rosie has helped herself to tomatoes
jacob steps in
rosie pauses for a moment flapping her ears at jacob then shoves a bush of tomatoes in her mouth
jacob almost laughs
bad elephant thats not nice
this kind lady hasnt invited you
she exits into the house as rosie wraps her trunk around cabbages uprooting them as jacob tries to battle her trunk
greg arrives with a bucket he places in front of rosie
her trunk stops fighting jacob and sniffs inside the bucket
whats in the bucket
gin and ginger ale
elephants love booze
one whiff of this and shes not thinking about cabbages no more
bats her trunk away moj malutki paczuszek
are you polish
greg again pushes rosies trunk away from the bucket
last show i worked one bull faked a belly ache just to get the whiskey
better grab the hook
are you a bull man
august would hire you in a minute
dont want the job
not for him
besides im not bull man
i just like big beasts
jacob gets it and follows greg who carries the bucket
is she following
jacob turns around to see and sure enough rosie is leaving the garden and trotting behind to catch up to the bucket of gin and ginger ale
the show is still in progress we can hear the band playing for the aerialist act in the background
as jacob makes his way to marlenas stateroom he crosses paths with august whose face is dark as thunder
a little shaky
doc says shell be fine
did you catch the bull
shes in the menagerie
august takes the bull hook from jacob and walks with cold blooded intent towards the menagerie
jacob panics realizing what august about to do
jacob follows to stop him august
she was good
she came back on her own
besides you cant do anything now
the show is still going on
the band will drown it out
jacob touches augusts arm
august turns on jacob with a murderous expression shoving him to the ground
jacob is about to get up to fight but august cautions him with the bull hook to stay down
august smiles slightly
would he really use that bull hook on jacob or is he kidding
jacob stays down
august continues on entering the menagerie tent
jacob sees marlena running towards him
jacob and marlena run across the grounds to the menagerie as workmen are running out of the menagerie tent hearing august screaming from inside
they enter the menagerie tent to see
august is beating rosie who cries out with each blow
the animals are panicking from inside their cages the lions roaring the monkeys squealing
marlena freezes at the entrance as jacob runs to august
august turns to see her
enraged he stops jacob with get her out of here
jacob wants to help rosie but can not disobey august in this moment
he returns to marlena and ushers her out as august continues to beat rosie
marlena and jacob step away hearing rosie cry out
marlena cant bear it
she grabs jacobs hand for support
jacob tentatively holds onto her waist guiding her away
she leans into him
jacob loves being this close to her
the screams of august o
pull their attention to see earl and his men physically dragging a maniacal august out of the tent his bull hook and clothes bloodied by his rage
he is kicking and struggling against them like a madman
jacob is shocked by augusts behavior
but marlena has seen it before
she pulls away from jacob and exits o
rosie is lying on her side her foot still chained to the stake
she is quivering riddled with bloodied holes
jacob is kneeling applying zinc ointment not knowing where he can touch that wont hurt her
he is heart broken
rosie what am i going to do with you
rosies eyes look up to him her lashes blinking
her trunk lifts and wipes at her own eye
greg appears with a bucket and several bottles of whiskey
he begins pouring whiskey bottles into a bucket
here this will help
he really hurt her
told you about him
curses august in polish dont understand why a man like that wants to be around animals in the first place
he shouldnt have the right if you ask me
listening to greg jacob gets increasingly angry
he sees the bull hook
he grabs it and marches out of the menagerie
earls men are smoking when one sees jacob marching angrily towards augusts stateroom carrying the bull hook
alerted somebody better find earl
jacob reaches the platform to find the door ajar
he moves through it
the stateroom is in a shambles
an open suitcase of womens clothes lies strewn across the floor
august appears from behind the curtain he looks uncharacteristically distraught
teary eyed and unkempt
do you know where marlena is
did she send you
she wont speak to me
he cant finish
he sits burying his head in his hands
she wont let me apologize
she wont forgive me
jacob is astounded by augusts sad pitiable state
i dont know what happens to me jacob
when i saw that bull running wild with marlena i
i lost my mind
but its because i love her
why cant she understand that
jacob stands coldly isnt there anyone who understands
jacob remains silent ah its all my fault i know it is
ive spent too much money on that bull
i cant pay the workmen
our debts are piling
were losing attendance at every show
i have no star attraction
i dont know whats going to happen to us if rosie doesnt sell tickets
if i lose this circus ill lose marlena i know it
jacob softens seeing august in this helpless humble light
im sure thats not true
maybe you can talk to her
shes tired of my apologies but this pressure im under
of course thats no excuse for what i did
rubs the images away i cant believe what i did
is she all right
shell be ok
would you tell marlena
and tell her
tell her ill do anything
anything she wants
august i cant
im sure shell forgive you
she loves you
anyone can see that
august wants to believe him
he seems more hopeful
jacob nods confused his anger diffused
as he exits jacob
jacob stops and turns back as august asks what were you planning to do with that bull hook
jacob realizes hes holding the bull hook
you look like me
jacob looks in the mirror and indeed with rosies blood on his open shirt bull hook in hand he looks like a violent man
maybe there is someone who understands me
but jacob is unnerved by the smile
and the comparison
suddenly earl enters and looks around on alert whats going on
everythings fine earl
august nods to jacob who pushes past earl to exit
jacob jumps down off the platform
confused and disgusted he takes the bull hook wedges it under the train and breaks it in half
jacob enters to find greg still treating rosie
hows she doing
oh shes a strong one this one
jestes dobra dziewczynka jacob watches as rosie lifts her foot and greg rubs ointment
jacob sees the many empty whiskey bottles
is she drunk
shes four tons
shell just sleep good
screwing ointment top potoz noge
jacob watches as rosie puts her foot back on the ground
masz moja piekna jacob watches as greg digs in his pocket and pulls out a mint brushing off the lint
rosies trunk investigates then nimbly plucks it out of his hand and into her mouth
oh my god
an excited jacob is leading august to the menagerie tent
jacob leads august to rosie
a curious greg stops tending to rosie
jacob hands august a slip of paper with polish words
just read those out loud
august reads the words in polish with jacobs help
da da daj
rosie does nothing
august looks to jacob
jacob is worried
greg suggests in a low whisper might help if he said please
prosze rosie daj noge
pros prozze rosie
rosie lifts her foot
augusts eyes gleam
reads and recites rosie
rosie puts her foot down
august starts to understand
reads and recites do tylu rosie
rosie sighs shifts her weight then takes a couple of steps backward
august is amazed
jacob is thrilled
that fox bros bull man didnt tell us was the elephant tramp who sold rosie to them was polish
august grabs jacob and kisses him on the mouth
weve got a new star
greg remains cautious
the live band plays on a raised platform
the dance floor is jammed with couples
tables and u shaped booths surround the dance floor
tuxedoed bartenders serve from a wooden bar lined with hundreds of bottles in front of a smoky mirror
august jacob and marlena sit in a booth
they are drunk on their third bottle of champagne
marlena is wearing a beautiful low cut beaded red gown
jacob can barely keep his eyes off of her
marlena is particularly drunk weve never seen her this wild or spontaneous
she sings along with the band
she keeps rhythm by banging her hands on the table
however she is acting distant to august
august is happy she is having a good time
when he slides next to her and puts his arm around her marlena stiffens would you like to dance darling
no thank you
marlena takes her champagne glass and drinks the last of it
august tries to make light of it
we need more champagne
ill get it
no you stay with marlena
august kisses her cheek but marlena is clearly still upset
august lets her be
he exits o
you ever going to let him off the hook
thats an unfortunate choice of words
rosies going be great
he wont hurt her again
i know it
jacob what you know about august is pretty much nothing
jacob feels put down
marlena realizes that came out too brusquely
she softens and explains with vulnerability you know how many star acts weve had
how much money weve made and lost and made
silver star paid for our new stateroom and look what happened to him
everything august touches gets fed to the cats one way or another
hell never change
jacob is moved
marlena shifts gears and rises
i want to dance
maybe you should wait for august
i want to dance now
she pulls him up onto the dance floor
marlena dances light as air
she spins from jacob then returns to his arms so that her back is to him
jacobs forearm is on her collarbone skin to skin
her chest rises and falls under his arm
her hair under his chin jacob can smell her fragrance then she unwinds away from like a ribbon
when the music stops everyone applauds their dance including marlena
he looks up to the bar august stands stock still
his eyes glaring at jacob
the dark expression weve come to know
seething with quiet rage
jacob takes a step back from marlena when suddenly they hear pandemonium jacob is swept by a crush of bodies
people scream shoving their way towards the exit
marlena is shoved along with them a few heads in front of jacob
jacob reaches through the sea of flesh and grabs a hand
by marlenas expression we know he has grasped her hand
jacob scans the panicked crowd for august but all he sees are strangers running in every direction people screaming
jacobs hand is ripped apart from marlena at the doorway
jacob is thrown into the alley
people are piling into cars engines are starting wheels squealing
suddenly marlena appears grabbing jacobs hand
she takes off her shoes
they run through back streets
they run under a fire escape panting out of breath
the sirens and screams of the crowd are distant
lord that was close
aw look at my stockings
and theyre silk too
i wonder if august got out
marlena looks up at jacob and starts laughing hysterically as if for no reason
they are both still drunk
i dont know how were going to get home
ive never been in new york have you
marlenas laughing subsides as she gets an idea
i want to see the empire state building
what about august
i dont know where he is do you
and he doesnt know where we are
its not our fault
like you said who knows how long itll take us to get back
jacob is hesitant
marlena takes his hand and softly pleads just a few hours jacob
for just a few hours we dont belong anywhere
we dont belong to anyone
jacob looks in her eyes and knows he shouldnt but
i was doomed
they run off
a summer storm with thunder and lightening is coming towards them from over the hudson river
marlena and jacob are looking out at the expansive view of new york city
other couples stroll about the sky deck
marlena breathes in deeply
ive never seen so far
jacob shakes head look at it
as far as the eye can see and its nowhere near all thats out there
jacob notices tears in her eyes
are you all right
yes hahaha im fine
im a complete mess
suddenly marlena screams as loud as she can startling the other couples
beat of silence then sorry
but jacob understands he screams and marlena joins in
the other couples leave the sky deck to get out of the rain and away from that crazy couple
marlena and jacob stop wet panting laughing from the release
then looking out at the view not at each other
marlena begins to confess what she needs jacob to know
i need you to do something for me
promise me you will
i want you to go
i want you get away from us from the show
youre smart jacob
you deserve better than us
leave as soon as you can or something terribles going to happen
surprised confused why are you saying this
its all right
no one can hear
well never get another chance to say it all
marlena looks into jacobs eyes and finally addresses what theyre both thinking nothing can ever happen with us you know
its too dangerous
august will never let me go
you dont know what hes capable of
how can you be with a man youre frightened of
i dont have to feel afraid of him if i dont feel anything
after all these years ive learned how to do it so well
i tell myself im managing
i can manage him
august loves me
nobody else ever did
who am i to say its the wrong kind of love
see theres no place for a woman like me in any decent kind of world
you know where they found me when i was a baby
in an alley behind a whore house in baltimore wrapped in newspaper
no one even bothered to leave a note
this circus my horses this is the only kind of life i can have
august made a woman like me a star attraction
and im safe
and i was fine before you came
jacob feels sorry and hopeful at the same time
theres nothing that can cause a woman so much trouble as a good man
im not that good
and i dont want to be
dont say that
no i dont
good men dont wind up with much in the end except their goodness
isnt worth much is it
look what weve done to you already
she touches jacobs face gently
until this moment they didnt realize how close they are to each other tracing jacobs face with her hands as he leans in closer
you deserve as good a life any other girl
am i still a girl
i feel so old
they stop and silently acknowledge where this is going
as they move towards a secluded spot they continue to kiss in between lines
this can only be tonight
we have to go back
promise me you understand
promise me youll suffer
i already am
promise youll look in my eyes the whole time
jacob kisses her with his eyes locked onto hers
with marlenas back pressed against the entrance jacob reaches up and locks the door
they sink to the ground
marlena sits inside jacobs embrace on the ferry her head leaning against his chest their hands entwined
if i had money if i could take care of you would we be going back
youd have to be a rockefeller
august would find me
he always does
have you tried to get away before
jacob you promised
you said you understood it was only tonight
jacob walks marlena out of the port to a waiting cab
they stop a few feet from the cab
jacob gives her all the money in his pockets
marlena looks at him as if for the last time
where were you when i was
they kiss not wanting to let go
marlena pulls away and runs into the cab
jacob watches it drive away
jacob reaches the circus
everyone is asleep
jacob enters the menagerie heading straight for rosie
he gets on the ground beneath her and lies down
rosie raises her trunk to allow jacob to lie beneath her
jacob is asleep under rosie when walter wakes him up
why are you sleeping here
somebodys looking for you
jacob and walter enter to find bill and grady hiding an ailing camel in a dimly lit car
jacob kneels down to him
how nice to see ya
i dont know kid
woke up a few days ago and my feet was all floppy
jes cant feelem right
it aint just that though
its other stuff too
like down there
camel his eyes wide and fearful nods slowly
whats wrong with him doc
i dont know
jamaica ginger paralysis
ive seen it before
no such thing
is there doc
walter looks at camels empty jake bottle
the manufacturer started putting this plasticizer in it or something to get around regulations that jamaica ginger extract not be sold as booze
youre not supposed to drink this stuff ya know
well what the hell am i supposed to drink to stop the shakes
its prohibition and i aint no astor
its ok camel
well get you some moonshine
grady dont lie to the man
if men were getting paid blackie wouldnt have tossed four of em between boonton and weehawken
will he get better
walter looks at him his expression says no
we cant leave him here
theyll red light him for sure
he gets an idea and turns to walter
walter understands and reacts with an adamant walter is walking quickly back to the performer train
jacob follows trying to reason with him
throughout the scene they are looking out for blackies men and speaking low
blackie and his men only patrol the roustabout cars
they dont work the performer train
we can hide him easy until until when
what are we going to do with him
shoot him like silver star
because thats what he is jacob
in a week he wont be able to move his legs at all
he has a son in pennsylvania
were playing there in three weeks
thats all he needs
walter doesnt want to do this but clearly cant say no
i was right about you
youre going blow us all up
august got home tonight before you and marlena
people are talking
walter stalks off leaving jacob unhinged by the news
i shouldnt be a clown
i should be a goddamn fortune teller
the cookhouse tent is divided into two sections by a curtain
one one side working men and the buffet table of food
it is made up of benches and bare wood tables with salt and pepper shakers
the other side of the curtain is filled with performers
the tables have a checkered tablecloth and flowers
marlena is sitting alone drinking a cup of coffee
he sits opposite her
good morning jacob how are you
jacob senses others eavesdropping
but the table is far enough away so they cant be heard
i wanted to uh
is there any chance i could speak with you alone
is something wrong
i just wanted to
walter said people are talking about what happened
oh jacob champagne completely overwhelms my senses
i always feel the better for it when i abstain
all i remember is getting pushed by the crowd and then running and getting a hole in my stocking
i dont even know how i got home
i dont remember a thing
well i want to apologize for
ha ha jacob its silly of you to apologize for my torn stockings
you werent even there
jacob is crushed by her reaction
marlena maintains her upbeat facade
august enters with his tray of food and crosses to them
he is smiling like a man who has spent the night having great sex
august kisses marlena right in front of jacob
it is a long sensual kiss
a holdover from their night together
i slept like a baby after last night
thank you my darling
were in public
jacob understands his meaning and is quietly devastated
ah nothing to be ashamed of
man and wife reuniting in the most sacred of marriage places
my marlena has forgiven me
alls well with the world again right jacob
that was quite an adventure last night
im glad i didnt have to bail you out
how did you get home
i dont know
i just ran
how did you two get separated
you were so close on the dance floor
i told you sweetheart
we got pushed apart by the crowd
this older married couple brought me to the ferry
id like to look them up and invite them to the show free of charge
ill even pay for their transportation
id pay it a hundred times over to anyone who helped my wife to safety
thank goodness she had chaperones
if anyone had harmed her or even touched her theres no knowing what i might do
jacob makes note of the implication
marlena ignores it
while jacob coaches august from the sidelines the company of performers and workmen watch august command rosie in polish
august said he would create an act for marlena and rosie that would haveem line up for miles
august and the company are delighted when rosie lifts her foot
or walks forward then backward
his accent was awful but rosie obeyed without fail
marlena watches full of excitement and praise for august
he instructs marlena where to stand
he commands rosie who lifts marlena up with her trunk
everyone cheers and applauds
those near jacob pat him on the back grateful that he saved the circus
i was finally a part of them
when they enter the center ring they stop
august gives rosie the command to lift marlena down with her trunk
but rosie hesitates
august commands her again with more force
but rosie doesnt move forward
she shuffles a foot backwards
august grips his silver tipped cane
jacob and other performers watch anxiously
will rosie fail
then august turns to the audience and mimes apologizing to the crowd
when he back is turned rosie hits his butt with her trunk
the crowd laughs uproariously
jacob and the others realize its all part of the act
walter slaps his back
barbara kisses his cheek
august displays great performance skills
he turns to rosie acting suspicious
rosie lifts her head away as if to say it wasnt me
august turns back to the crowd to apologize and once again rosie flicks his behind with her trunk
this time august knows it her
he turns to her tips his hat over his brow and shakes his finger scolding as if to say no no no rosie responds by waving her trunk mocking him
and the crowd bursts into applause
august commands rosie who lifts marlena with her trunk and places her on the ground
posters of rosie and marlena highlight the act coming soon
blackie and his men are covering up the posters of other circuses and town events
august could have given barnum a run for his money
he spent the payroll money on expensive posters promoting that act like it was bigger than ringling
and we sold out every performance in every town
marlena blows kisses to the audience
she skips theatrically around the ring with rosie trotting behind her august hovering beside
marlena stops and wipes her brow feigning exhaustion and sits on a small ball
rosie observes her with a smile and a raised trunk
rosie copies marlenas actions placing her enormous rear down on a much larger ball
the crowd screams with laughter
marlena stands in mock outrage wagging her finger at rosie
she turns her back on her folding her arms
rosie also stands and presents marlena with her rear end facing the other way
the audience loves it
in that center ring rosie became a guaranteed star attraction
jacob sits alone facing rosie in her massive stock car made of steel talking to her in polish
alone with me telling her every thing i couldnt tell anyone else she became the closest thing i had to family
marlena looks back and scowls
with dramatic flair she raises one foot and places it on the small ball as if to say take that elephant
rosie not to be out done guided by augusts polish commands curls her trunk lifts her foot and places it on her larger ball
marlena straightens out both arms and extends her other leg like a ballerinas toe pointed
she place the foot alongside the other so that she is now standing atop the ball
rosie waits a moment then lifts her other front foot onto the ball
the crowd explodes
august pretends to be outraged with marlena
but as showers of coins and money rain upon them august and marlena stand beneath showers of glittering coins
ha august was a new man
the workmen set up the circus with energy and renewed spirit
august treating them with pats on the back of gratitude
treating everybody first class spreading the word his rosie act would finally get the men paid
jacob walter and a camel enjoy a card game and moonshine
and with business so strong nobody was worried about getting tossed so we didnt have to worry so much about old camel
august is filling a bucket with gin and ginger ale for rosie
and nothing was too good for rosie
when august found out she liked gin and ginger ale he made sure she got both every day treating her like some favorite child
marlena does a double take then lifts up her finger as if to say i have an idea
with a rising drum roll she shuffles her feet atop the ball moving herself around the ring
rosie places all four of her feet onto the larger ball and rolls herself around the ring
marlena and rosie go faster and faster along with the music
the crowd goes wild
august takes marlenas hand and kisses it as they take their bows
but i didnt trust the new august
i kept waiting for the real one to show up
out of the darkness of the car rosie appears in the light being guided down the ramp by august who gently pets her trunk whispering in her ear
her ears flapping she purrs with affection
it was when i saw rosie purring under his touch as if nothing had happened between them that the worst thought occurred to me
marlena and jacob are laughing listening to august telling a story after a private dinner
jacob glances at marlena
maybe i was the man not to be trusted
marlena moves to augusts lap
jacob watches marlena looked happy
and it broke my heart
the circus is nothing without its traditions
august has gathered all the performers and trainers in a circle
jacob stands in the center
marlena beside august
its a family
and like any family when a new member is born its arrival must be greeted with celebration and gratitude
now weve been a little busy with sold out performances thank the gods
but right now i want to take this moment before todays show to gather together
we close our eyes
everyone closes their eyes
and we thank whoevers up there that sends desperate men running for the rails
because it was a lucky day when jacob jankowski jumped our train
because of him together with our beautiful rosie and my beloved marlena we have the greatest star attraction in benzini brothers history
he found a way to save us all
and so to officially welcome jacob into the family we open our eyes
everyone opens their eyes
and we give him the traditional benzini brothers baptism
jacob is a mess covered in pies seltzer and confetti
the company breaks up with laughter applauds and cheers
walter and barbara bring jacob towels embracing and kissing him
the rest of the company follows suit
august motions for marlena who retrieves a large mens clothing box and carries it to jacob as august watches from a distance
the crowd parts as marlena hands him the box
august watches jacob open the box to find his own tuxedo
now you dont have to borrow mine
everyone applauds hugging and kissing jacob thank you august
its from both of us
jacob looks to marlena
it is awkward between them
they cant kiss each other
jacob nods and says courteously thank you marlena
youre welcome jacob
as marlena exits with the others we discover august watching from them a distance augusts expression tells us he knows what they are hiding
marlena and rosie exits the big top
we hear tumultuous applause coming from inside
jacob awaits them as usual
jacob commands rosie who lifts marlena off his back and places her carefully on the ground
jacob pets and commands rosie to follow him but stops when i wonder if you could help me
ive planned a surprise for august
hes been so wonderful dont you think
could you make sure rosie is staked in my tent after the show
thank you so much
oh and im sure it would be nice for august if you were there too
marlena turns and exits o
jacob isnt sure what to think
rosie is staked into the grass inside marlenas tent happily occupied with a pile of watermelons
marlena wears a silk beaded dress with the diamond necklace
there is a serving table with silver domed platters and wine bottles
marlena is trying to open a champagne bottle when jacob enters
oh hell be here any second
jacob can you open this for me
jacob takes the champagne bottle and manipulates the cork
rosies trunk is curious inspecting the bottle in jacobs hand
marlena sees and laughs as well
rosie continues fooling around causing marlena and jacob to laugh even harder when the cork pops
what is this
jacob and marlena turn to see august enter laying down his hat and coat his shirt unbuttoned at the top
jacob pours the champagne into two flutes which marlena rushes up to august handing him a glass and kissing him
did you show jacob the opening night present i gave you
marlena turns to jacob and indicates the diamond necklace
indicating the necklace oh
do you see jacob
it looks stunning on you
they kiss again
marlena raises her glass of champagne
to august an authentic miracle man because he made a star attraction out of me
august nods in gratitude
they tilt their glasses and drink
forgive me for arriving too soon and spoiling the surprise
august takes out a cigarette and lights it
dont be silly
i couldnt wait for you to come
i could go back out to give you more time
or better yet yell raid and clear the place out so you two can be alone
in a split second jacob and marlena know the danger present
august gave no sign of it coming
im probably wrong
i assumed that night after the raid was the first time you two fucked but obviously its been going on longer than that
auggie youre being silly
did you think i didnt know
august dont do this
marlena gets frightened
august saunters over to the silver tipped cane leaning against the flap
he picks it up as marlena and jacob remain still
suddenly they hear rosie peeing where she is staked
she too is frightened
how long did you think you could keep this from me
august please theres nothing august swipes the tables with the cane knocking all the platters and glasses to the floor
we should go
so you two are a couple
i just dont think youre safe to be around a woman right now
this is not a woman
this is my wife you ivy league lying piece of shit
say i bet the authorities would like to know you practise without a license
dont you see how much i love you
i see you
i see you too clearly
i have to admit that was a nice touch when you got back from the speakeasy
being with me in our bed after being with him
covering your tracks
i should have known a whore only performs for a man like that when she wants something
marlena come with me
marlena drops the fluted glasses crying suddenly hes quiet
he stands still
marlena approaches him now cautiously but tenderly
are you all right now
august looks at her
marlenas expression is one of care and concern
jacob watches carefully
has it passed
suddenly august flicks his lit cigarette into rosies open mouth rosie reacts and jacob moves to help her as august grabs marlena shoving her so hard she falls against the
table knocking it and her to the ground
he attacks her trying to rip off her diamond necklace
jacob attacks august pulling him off of marlena
jacob and august fight savagely pounding each others faces crashing against broken plates and spilled gravy banging their heads viciously against the ground rolling over each other as they alternately
marlena screams for them to stop
rosie bellows pulling on her leg chain
the fight spills out of the tent into the circus grounds
jacob and august continue beating each other as they roll out into the crowd
augusts madness empowers him
he manages to overpower jacob in a choke hold
jacob is losing consciousness
because of marlenas screams earl and his men run to the tent
within seconds they are pulling august off of jacob
august gets to his feet
his cool expression is even more frightening as he re enters marlenas tent
from inside the tent they hear a crash
no he wont kid
earl disperses the crowd that has gathered which includes walter who sees jacobs bloodied face and goes to him
from inside the tent they hear two soft thuds
then a louder one
then an unnerving silence
see its over
can we let you go
jacob pants and nods
earl and one of his men let jacob go in degrees until he is standing up
walter holds his waist
come on jacob
with walters help he tears his eyes from the billowing flap and walks away passing rubes who watch with fascination
walter uncorks a jug of moonshine and hands it to jacob who holds a towel to his bloody beaten face
jacob drinks from the jug panting until the pain subsides
camel speaks from behind the trunks
the only thing thats keeping you alive right now are the rubes who saw everything
august cant risk getting rid of you here
but you better not get back on this train when we leave tomorrow night
somebody turn me around
share some of that jug
shut up camel
well what the hell
camel uses whatever strength his has to push aside the trunk and see bloody jacob
who did that to you
is it true
jacob wants to deny it but his silence speaks the truth
he can only manage to shake his head no
but walter can read between the lines
he lowers his head in despair
the train starts to move
all three react with surprise
why are we moving
we have a matinee tomorrow
somethings gone wrong
suddenly a knock on the door
the three men immediately are on alert
walter grabs his knife from beneath his pillow
camel tries to shove himself behind the trunks
the knock comes again as we hear jacob
jacob its marlena
they breath a sigh
jacob opens the door to reveal
marlena with a black eye
jacob rises to her
i had nowhere to go
i told him im leaving him
are you all right
looks worse than it feels
re jacobs face laughs ha look at the two of us
marlena awkwardly enters the room to walter and camels stares
she sees the moonshine and breaks the ice
can i have a swig of that
walter throws her the moonshine
marlena drinks like a pro
why is the train moving
marlena sits with the jug casually talking were being run out
apparently august was so optimistic about money coming in for rosie he figured hed double down and find himself a new fat lady to put him really toe to toe
so he sent mr
erwin into town who finds this rather large woman in a restaurant and offers her the job
she was the police chiefs wife
erwin got a left hook in the jaw and we got til morning to get out of town
this cracks everybody up
a release of tension
but the laughter turns to quiet sadness as the reality of their situation sinks in
marlena looks to jacob and leans into his arms
he holds her clearly in love then ushers her out of the room for privacy
walter sees what he knew all along
he kisses queenie aw girl
were all in it now
marlena and jacob exit walters room outside of which marlena placed her small suitcase
they pass by marlenas horses
why are you hiding that roustabout
because blackie and his men dont work the performer train and theyll red light him if they find him
he cant work anymore
they come upon silver stars stall empty right before the door to the next car
does august know where you are
he thinks im with barbara and the girls
he wont go there
he cant find you
as soon as we stop before we stop well jump off and ill take you to a hotel in town
and after that
august has all our money
where will i go
marlena im not leaving you
well find a way together
i wont let you go back to him
marlena smiles needing to hear him say those words
she embraces him grateful
jacob holds her tight assuring ill call my dean at cornell
if i can take my finals again get my degree i can get my license
they lay in the silver stars empty stall
moonlit through the wooden slats
oh jacob that would be wonderful
you know i bet ringling would take us both then theyd be getting a vet and a star attraction thats a sweet deal for them
although i wont be a star but i dont care
ill take no billing at all
wed be safe from august if we were with ringling
dont worry about him
of course id have to wait a while until i can work again
what do you mean
im going to have a baby
jacob is stunned
please dont ask me how i know
is it all right
you can change your mind
overwhelmed jacob keeps kissing her
marlena lets go of all the anxiety she had about him
he loves her
she knows it
change my mind
oh marlena please
please be happy
cries relieved i will
as soon as i stop being terrified
jacob kisses her
he guides her to the ground against the hay
she nestles in his arms
im so tired
ive got you now
marlena tries closing her eyes
then without warning
kinko sits against the door holding a trembling queenie hearing the screams and struggle
camel quivers in fear behind the trunks
a heavy rain pours
a bloodied battered jacob is semi conscious face down in a stream in the woods
jacob his eyes almost swollen shut wakes out of unconsciousness
he looks up through blurred vision
through the trees he can see a distant flickering red light
his knees buckle and he crawls out to the ground
he stands again
and he walks out of the woods towards the flickering light
he stumbles and falls
he rises and fumbles forward
using all his strength to get himself out of the woods
jacob struggles out of the woods to a clearing
squinting through the rain with swollen eyes he sees
he walks with legs barely able to move
he climbs up the gravel to the train tracks and begins to walk
jacob is walking on the train tracks in the direction of marlenas train
he has walked all night and into the day
jacob beaten bloodied exhausted looks up ahead the benzini bros
train and the big top tents already set up
its pre matinee
all the tents have been set up
the rubes are filling the grounds
the midway is packed with people
nell is sitting by an open window fanning herself from the heat when she sees jacob wandering behind the back of the train where no one can see him
nell watches as jacob tries to reach the train then falls unconscious
nell quickly brings barbara to the window
barbara sees jacob and immediately takes charge
camera tracks barbara and the girls through the windows as they walk through the car
barbara is organizing a plan with the girls
nell and two coochie girls hold their robes closed as they walk among the crowd
the coochie girls head for blackie and his security men
they talk to them to distract them
we see nell approach walter in full clown make up doing tricks with queenie for the crowd
nell whispers to walter
his expression tells us what we know
barbara and the tattooed man sneak to the fallen jacob with a blanket
they turn him over shocked by his condition
jacobs eyes open hes delirious
help me with him
delirious to tattoo man dont you work the matinee
i gotta re ink
they cover him pick him up and carry him off
jacob opens his eyes
walter is applying wet cloths to his head
camel watches nearby
jacob suddenly rises marlena
where is she
did he hurt her
i dont know
your pupils are two different sizes
jacob pushes himself up onto his elbows but his world spins
i have to get marlena
what if he jacob look at me
youve got a concussion and youre on a moving train
theres nothing you can do
marlena can handle him
shes done it for years
i have to get her
jacob you cant
shes going to have a baby
walter is stopped
camel shakes his head
does august know
jacob shakes his head what have you done to us
were going to ringling
you can too
im a fifth rate clown when second rate circuses are folding all over the place
doesnt put me on top of ringlings list
theyve got a dozen of me in the wings
i couldnt even go if i wanted to
august wont pay anyone
says the shows debts have to come first
first time in benzini bros history performers havent been paid
people are starving out there jacob
in the united states of america
where am i going to go
what about family
like my son
gotta have somebody
not a woman i have any use for
shes sold me to this outfit when i was
she sold you
im not exactly cut out for farm work
dont worry about me
if you and marlena go if august doesnt kill you first ill know what to do
ill tell august how well i got to know you and how i can help him find you
might even get myself a better room out of the bargain
it wont be anything personal you understand
each wants the other to survive at any cost
do whatever you have to walter
you too jacob
they exchange a final look which is a goodbye
walter turns away from jacob holding queenie to his chest
camel looks compassionately at jacob and says ya poor kid
the night this train passed ya
you shoulda kept on running i guess
camel and walter are snoring asleep with their backs to jacob
queenie is asleep nestled in walters arms
jacob struggles to raise himself up
his world spins
he holds tight to the bedroll until the spinning subsides
jacob is a man with a mission
his eyes focus on walters knife sticking out from beneath walters pillow
the train is moving fast
the rain has returned
jacob is making his way towards the back of the train as it moves forward
he holds the knife in his mouth
moving like a tightrope walker over the wet train roof as rain pours
when he reaches the cars end he takes a deep breath
with all his strength he leaps across the divide between the cars and lands clinging to the top rail panting like a dog
he removes the knife from his mouth having cut his lip
he licks the blood back and replaces the knife this time keeping his lips retracted
jacob leaps to the roof of marlena and augusts car
at this moment the train is making a curve
jacob climbs down over the side ladder
beyond him we see jacob jumps to the platform
he can see the rocky waters far below the trestle
he catches his breath and waits as the train straightens out onto land again
jacob turns the knob of the door to the stateroom slowly hearing a click pausing then opening it
jacob enters the stateroom leaving the door open
he creeps towards the velvet curtain which is closed
he grips the knife
when he reaches it he pulls the edge and peeks inside
august is asleep on his side his arms locked around marlena who is awake facing the curtain
jacob and marlenas eyes meet
she sees the knife in his hand august suddenly moves pulls marlena closer to his chest burying his face in her neck
jacob steps forward raising the knife
his hands tremble
the moonlight glints off the blade throwing off light
marlena is looking up at him tears in her eyes
she subtly shakes her head no
she doesnt want him to do this
jacobs hands are shaking now
the knife gripped in his hand
he wants to rescue her hes so close
we hold the moment
marlenas expression convinces jacob not to do it
not to cross that line and kill august
defeated jacob kneels beside her and hangs his head
marlena reaches out to touch him
this time she really is saying goodbye
but jacob can not bear it
he looks at her for the last time then rises and exits
jacob returns to the ring stock car hopping down from the roof
the horses are stirring agitated
he calms them
and then jacob sees the door to walters room is open
jacob enters to find the room in a shambles
a terrible realization comes over him walter and camel are gone
they have been red lighted
he finds queenie shaking with fear curled in a ball
he takes her in his arms
with queenie he rushes back into the ring stock car
he checks everywhere calling out their names
he stops at the open stock car door
the rain continues to fall
jacob collapses holding queenie to his chest
tears fill his eyes as he tries to hold it together looking out the moving train his worst nightmare realized
i wanted to believe taking walters knife didnt make a difference
i left him without a fighting chance
maybe they survived
maybe they were tossed over grassy land
i couldnt let myself believe what i already knew
jacob falls apart crying without shame
a sunny day
the circus is completely set up
townsfolk rubes are already buying tickets for the matinee
i waited almost til matinee time so i could let myself be seen by as many people from town
jacob opens the ring stock car and jumps out holding queenie
he hasnt slept all night
as he walks through the circus grounds working men like greg and performers like barbara are shocked to see him alive
with a fools courage he brazenly walks past blackie and his men cutting a path through performers and working men right up to august who stands with earl at his
he is dressed and ready for the matinees performance
jacob stops and they exchange looks
august glances at queenie in jacobs arms
he says nothing
im not here to cause any trouble
funny i thought you already left
id like to say goodbye
to the menagerie
just a few minutes and then ill go
augusts eyes narrow
earl waits for the outcome
theres nothing more you can do to me
killing mell be more trouble than its worth now that the rubes have seen me
you were right about me from the start august when you said i wouldnt last
i cant survive here
i am nothing
august feels victorious and therefore benevolent
earl take him to the menagerie
then escort him out of my circus into altoona
and if he comes back you can shoot him as that is within our lawful rights with regards to trespassers
august walks away
earl escorts jacob to the menagerie
on the way they pass barbara
jacob pauses to hand queenie to her
she has tears in her eyes
jacob continues with earl
jacob enters alone
he takes in all the animals who look back at him
he crosses to rosie and stands before her
her trunk greets him stroking him
he presses his head against her
rosie comforts him
it makes jacob fall apart all the more
after a few moments jacob turns and walks away
he stops in the center of the menagerie
he looks at each animal in their den in the same way as when he first met them this time saying goodbye
each animal is at the front of its den or cage looking at jacob
there is a silent exchange between them
come on kid
when jacob starts to exit again something happens the lock on rexs cage busts a little as he rams against it
as earl escorts jacob they walk against the tide of audience members walking to the big top entrance
earl speaks low
its good youre going
they must have known you got back on the train last night
he tossed more than half a dozen working men
kinkers never get tossed
so that was meant for you
we hear the gounod waltz starting in the big top
a few of the guys that got tossed caught up with us again
instantly earls expression tells jacob its bad news
jacobs breathing almost stops as he listens keep walking
they got tossed off the trestle if you can believe it
camels head hit the rocks
he died right away
jacob is heartbroken and dreads what hes about to hear
earl pauses for a beat
this part is harder to tell walter
walters legs were smashed up real bad
they had to leave him
they dont reckon he lasted the night
jacob is in shock
he can barely walk on
the ones that came back
i dont know how but one way or another theyre taking down august tonight
hearing this jacob stops to face earl
why are you telling me
earl can not find the words its clear the killing of these men does not sit well with him
earl shifts his focus hes alarmed
earl what was that
all the performers and work men on the midway are on alert
earl runs back towards the big top
what is it
the disaster march
everyone with the show barrels towards the big top when greg appears amongst them and calls to jacob jacob shoots through the tent flap and is immediately flung up against
the sidewall as hyena on his back
jacob looks to the menagerie and faces
jacob is scanning the tent for marlena when jacob manages to hold bobo in one arm and the orangutan in the other as his eyes sweep the tent searching for
marlena then jacob sees the panther makes its way through the searching and dodging animals jacob sees a flash of pink sequins
he sees august with marlena standing beside him in front of rosie
marlena sees jacob and makes a run for him but august quickly grabs her arm and flings her to the ground
she falls out of view from jacob
jacob runs to them dodging the fleeing animals when suddenly a bull hook flies from out of the air across the animals and pierces jacobs shoulder
he cries out
rosie cries out
she begins to stamp her feet
marlena lies with her face in the dirt crawling beneath the ropes to get under rosie for safety
august pulls jacob with a new bull hook tossing him the ground
august glares at him his eyes full of rage he attacks but jacob dodges the next blow grabbing onto the bull hook and twisting it with such strength it topples
august who refuses to let it go
jacob and august fight savagely amidst the stampede
like madmen fighting with the intention to kill
jacob unleashes a rage and a strength we have yet to see in him as he beats august without mercy
but august manages to overpower jacob unleashing his own maniacal fury
by taking advantage of the bull hook wound august gets jacob into a death grip around his neck
marlena screams out unable to help as animals stampede around the two men locked in combat
only rosie who towers above them knows what to do
jacob choking under augusts grip looks up at rosie
she raises her trunk to smile at him
jacob looks down and sees that rosies stake has been pulled out of the ground
jacob fights august to breathe as rosie reveals she is holding the stake loosely resting its end on the dirt
the chain still attached to her foot
jacob flips himself which forces august to turn his back on rosie in order to keep his grip on jacob
marlena covers her head in her arms not wanting to see
jacob can not breathe
august is squeezing the life from him rosie lifts the stake as if it weighs nothing and brings it down onto august splitting his head in one clean move
she continues to hold the stake until august topples forward dead his skull opened like a hardboiled egg
released of august jacob rolls himself under the ropes just
rosie then slides the stake back to the ground
marlena head hidden under her arms sees nothing
the menagerie is clear of the stampeding animals
marlena lifts her head up from beneath her arms remaining under rosie
she sees august lifeless body
she looks to jacob
he rises bloodied and beaten but alive
wide angle the empty menagerie except for jacob standing marlena under rosie and the two monkeys inspecting augusts dead body
the polar bear is walking calmly down main street
it took days to round them up
some we never did get back
two children are delighted that a giraffe is eating from their second story window
camera discovers a dishwasher and rex the lion both quivering huddled opposite each under beneath a sink
i dont know who was more scared the rubes or the animals
the nesci bros
circus train is pulling up alongside the ghost town of the benzini bros the ruins of the circus are highlighted by strong winds blowing up dust and dirt
when the nesci bros
circus showed we were officially belly up
a man screams after unrolling a canvas and making a discovery inside
a crowd forms
when jacob reaches it he sees
dick nesci and the sheriff fight with jacob over rosie
these animals are now the property of altoona and were here to sell them to mr
not all of them
some of these animals are mine like this bull
do you have any proof
jacob is stalled
hes just an elephant tramp
the bull is his
you dont want her anyway
she cant do anything
dumb as a box of peanut shells
skeptical dick nesci steps up to rosie
whats her name
jacob and rosie exchange eye contact
nesci is skeptical
gertrude step up
rosie blows and swings her trunk throwing dirt across the people around her
dick nesci takes the bull hook and prods under her leg ordering her up
rosie just swings her ears and sniffs dick nesci with her trunk
then checks his pockets for treats
jacob exchanges a look with rosie
jacob is walking rosie holding the orangutan with bobo atop rosie
through the wind and dust they look for marlena
of her black and white horses
marlena looks spent shocked relieved tearful hopeful
she reaches jacob
what happens now
i wish i knew
marlena exhausted eases into jacobs arms
wide angle jacob and marlena and their animals as the giant tent of the benzini bros
big top falls to the ground
jacob is finishing his story
charlie is enthralled
the first bottle of scotch is gone
the second half full
i convinced my dean to let me take my finals
marlena was right
with my degree our animals and marlenas acts ringling got a sweet deal
our son was born our first season
we named him walter
he spent the first seven years of his life with ringling
thats why i
i just cant understand how he forgot to show up today
his eyes glitter there was a circus in town
he looks affectionately at jacob
by the time our third son came wed had enough
rosie was tired
luckily the vet at the albany zoo dropped dead so i got the job
we bought some property so we could keep the horses
then five kids
bobo and that orangutan
never named that orangutan
nothing ever sounded
elegant enough for her
just called her maam
smiles with great joy man oh man that was
that was a life boy ill tell ya
charlie smiles appreciating this old mans big life
and then before you know it the kids are borrowing the car and moving out
marlena and i on our own again
until she passed
this moment causes jacob to pause
he still loves her
i never told marlena it was rosie who got august
i didnt want her to know
when rosie passed on she cried for days
i owe that bull my whole life
my kids everything
charlie peeks through the window and sees a cop its the heat
theyre here for me
charlie and jacob exchange a look
charlie opens the door to greet a local cop
hi officer can i help you
yes im hoping you can
an elderly gentleman went missing from the nursing home down the street
staff seems to think he came here
we had a lot of folks from the home today
but no i havent seen him
the cop peers past charlie and sees jacob
excuse me but who is that
pause then oh
thats my dad
the cop is suspicious
charlie covers he cant talk
had a major stroke a few years back
but hes doing well
aint ya pop
understanding the ruse jacob starts to play the part of a stroke victim he opens his mouth his jaw quivers
he reaches for his glass with a shaking arm
charlie helps him
jacob holds out his tongue like a parrots as charlie helps him drink
the cop watches with a blank expression
jacob swallows and nods speechless smiles and manages to drool
the cop wonders
then pulling out his card ok well thanks for your time
heres my number in case you hear of anything
sorry to bother you
the cop exits
charlie returns to sit opposite jacob
they consider this unspoken proposal you sure about this
beat as charlie pours another shot
then i wonder if we can get you into the book of records
oldest man who ever ran away with the circus
nah im not running away
just coming home
old jacob uses his walker to enter the menagerie
he moves to each animal meeting his eyes with theirs
each animal gives him a look of acknowledgment
he comes to an orangutan
younger than the one from his benzini days
he steadies himself
jacob lets go of the walker and reaches his arm out to the orangutans cage
the orangutan studies him for a moment
jacob keeps his arm extended which isnt easy for him
the orangutan then extends his hand through the bars to jacobs hand
jacobs fingers entwine around the orangutans hand
they hold for a moment
thank you maam
