assistant director ok so here it is
the entire script to clueless including important actions songs from the soundtrack and my own personal comments just hit the little speaker next to the characters name to hear the
lines from the movie theyre not working yet i hope you enjoy reading it as much as i enjoyed writing it
its amazing the things you pick up when watching a scene times
one thing this is written by a hopelessly devoted and loyal alicia silverstone fan so some of the commentary may be biased
but i figure if youre reading this then you must have some interest her
any suggestions errors anything
please email me pacey
com kids in america the muffs heaps of shots of the girls having fun so ok youre probably thinking is this like a noxema commercial or what
but seriously i actually have a way normal life for a teenage girl
i mean i get up i brush my teeth and i pick out my school clothes
fashion girl david bowie daddys a litigator
those are the scariest kinds of lawyers
even lucy our maid is terrified of him
hes so good he gets paid five hundred dollars an hour just to fight with people but he fights with me for free cause im his daughter
cher please dont start with the juice again
daddy you need your vitamin c
wheres my briefcase
its been a couple of months now so i say we go out to malibu
dont tell me those braindead low lifes have been calling again
they are your parents
and dont try sneaking out of the office
lovitz is coming by to give you a flu shot
oh josh is in town
hes coming for dinner
because hes your step brother
but you were hardly even married to his mother and that was five years ago
why do i have to see josh
watch those lips
you divorce wives not children
just a girl no doubt did i show you the loqued out jeep daddy got me
its got four wheel drive dual side airbags and monster sound system
i dont have a licence yet but i need something to learn on
cher runs over a potted plant on the kerb oh why that came out of nowhere
watch her face when she looks back at the road heres where dionne lives
shes my friend because we both know what its like to have people be jealous of us
and i must give her snaps for her courageous fashion efforts
dionne and i were both named after great singers of the past who now do infomercials
shopping with dr
well at least i wouldnt skin a collie to make my backpack
that was a stop sign
i totally paused
its not even eight thirty and murray is paging me
he is so possesive
tell me about it
this weekend he called me up and hes all where were you today
and im like im at my grandmothers house
dionne and her boyfriend murray are in this dramatic relationship
i think theyve seen that ike and tina turner movie just too many times
now i have to say to her
dee why do you put up with it
you could do so much better
alright sh sh
here he comes
shoop salt n pepa woman why dont you be answering any of my pages
i hate when you call me woman
where you been all weekend
you been jeepin around behind my back
watch cher closely
no but speaking of vehicular sex perhaps you can explain to me how this cheap k mart hair extension got into the back seat of your car
i dont know where that came from
that looks like one of your stringy something on others you got up here
i do not wear polyester hair ok
unlike some people i know like shawanna
dee im outie
why do you gotta go there
ive had it with you
is it that time of the month again
croud gasps i dont know why dionne is going out with a high school boy
theyre like dogs
you have to clean them and feed them and theyre just like these nervous creatures that jump and slobber all over you
random guy puts his arm around cher ooo
get off of me
uh as if
should all oppressed people be allowed refuge in america
amber will take the con position
cher will be pro
cher two minutes
so ok like right now for example the haitians need to come to america
but some people are all what about the strain on our resources
but its like when i had this garden party for my fathers birthday right
i said r
because it was a sit down dinner
but people came that like did not r
so i was like totally buggin
i had to haul ass to the kitchen redistribute the food squish in extra place settings but by the end of the day it was like the more the merrier
and so if the government could just get to the kitchen rearrange some things we could certainly party with the haitians
and in conclusion may i please remind you that it does not say r
on the statue of liberty
class breaks into applause thank you very much
hall how can i answer that
the topic is haiti and shes talking about some little party
it was his fiftieth birthday
if she doesnt do the assignment i cant do mine
so does anyone have any further thoughts on chers oration
yeah i cant find my cranberries cd
ive gotta do to the quad before somebody snags it
im afraid i cant permit that
any further insights
i had an insight mr
im all ears
ok like the way i feel about the rolling stones is the way my kids are going to feel about nine inch nails so i really shouldnt torment my mom
well its a little off the subject of haiti but tolerance is always a good lesson even when it comes out of nowhere
and with that in mind im going to distribute you report cards
now is there a christian stobich in this class
the buzz on christian is that his parents have joint custody so hell be spending one semester in chicago and one semester here
i think it is a travesty on the part of the legal profession
look at chers face while speaking
ahhh i cant take it anymore
thank you for that perspective cher
hall hands out the report cards now could all conversations please come to a halt
travis jumps up to the window and could the suicide attempts please be postponed till the next period
after cher the most classic character in the movie suddenly a dark cloud settled over first period
i got a c in debate
on phone dee
did you get your report card
yeah im toast
howd you do
i totally choked
my father is going to go ballistic on me
hall was way harsh
cher and dionne meet up in the hall he gave me a c minus
well he gave me a c which drags down my entire average
ill call ya ok
isnt my house classic
the columns date all the way back to
wasnt my mom a betty
she died when i was just a baby
a fluke accident during a routine liposuction
i dont remember her but i like to pretend she still watches over me
pretty groovy huh
fake plastic trees acoustic version radiohead yuk
uh the maudlin music of the university station
waa waa waa
cher enters the kitchen yuh what is it about college and cry baby music
hey whos watching the galleria
so the flannel shirt deal
is that a nod to the crispy seattle weather or are you just trying to stay warm in front of the refrigerator
grabs chers tummy oo wow
youre filling out there
your face is catching up with your mouth
i went by dads office
he is not your dad
why dont you torture a new family
hey just because my mother marries someone else doesnt mean hes my father
actually kato thats exactly what it means
they enter the lounge i hope youre not thinking of staying here
i sure want to
im sure you do
ive got a place in westwood near school
shouldnt you go to school on the east coast
i hear girls at n
arent at all particular
hahaha youre funny
josh changes the channel from beavis and butthead to the news hey
god you just got here and already youre playing couch commando
in some parts of the universe maybe not in contempo casual but in some parts its considered cool to know whats going on in the world
thank you josh
i so need lessons from you on how to be cool
tell me that part about kenny g again
from dining room cmon you chuckleheads get in here
they move to the dining room josh are you still growing
you look taller than you did at easter
i dont think so
to cher doesnt he look bigger
his head does
so josh have you given any thought to our little discussion about corporate law
yeah you know but i think id really like to check out environmental law
do you want to have a miserable frustrating life
oh josh will have that no matter what he does
at least he knows what hes doing
and hes in good college
id like to see you have a little bit of direction
i have direction
yeah towards the mall
which reminds me wheres your report card
its not ready yet
what do you mean its not ready yet
well some teachers are trying to low ball me daddy
and i know how you say never accept a first offer so i figure these grades are just a jumping off point to start negotiations
one of the mobile phones rings everyone answers their phone dee
yeah jake what
not the afternoon
cher and josh put their phones down you are such a brown noser
oh and you are such a superficial space cadet
what makes you think you can get teachers to change your grades
in background i told you i wanted it in the morning
doesnt he understand
in the morning
only the fact that ive done it every other semester
shake some action cracker i told my p
teaher an evil male had broken my heart so she raised my c to a b
im so miserable
i cant eat i cant sleep i cant study
theyre slime theyre slime i mean theyre horrible dont feel bad dont feel bad i know and you see theyre all like this
then i promised miss giest id start a letter writing campaign to my congressman about violations of the clean air act
hall was totally rigid
he said my debates were unresearched unstructured and unconvincing as if
i felt impotent and out of control which i really hate
i needed to find sanctuary in a place where i could gather my thoughts and regain my strength
dude whats wrong
are you suffering from buyers remorse or something
watch cher flick her head god no
nothing like that
its just that weve been shopping all day and i still dont know what to do about mr
i have tried everything to convince him of my scholastic aptitude but i was brutally rebuffed
get over it ok
hes a miserable little man who wants to make everyone else miserable too
dee thats it
weve got to figure out a way to make mr
hall sublimely happy
heres the four one one on mr
hes single hes and he earns minor duckets for a thankless job
what that man needs is a good healthy boinkfest
unfortunately there was a major babe drought in our school
the evil trolls from the math department were actually married
and in the grand tradition of p
stoeger seemed to be same sex oriented
of course there was always miss giest
something told me not to discount miss giest
well sure she has runs in her stockings and her slip is always showing and she always has more lipstick on her teeth than her mouth
god this woman is screaming for a make over
im her only hope
cher is writing a note outside miss giests pidgeon hole rough winds do shake the darling buds of may but thy eternal summer shall not fade
did you write that
duh its like a famous quote
travis and miss giest walk out of her office toward where cher and dionne have split the scene i know youre going to be better now
now you run along and ill see you third period and you will try to remember to bring your textbook
miss giest reads the note left by the girls and her face brightens oh my god
she actually looked happy
scene changes to mr
halls classroom paroudasm budapshawn tardies to work off
paroudasm mutters something in farsi and his friends cheer janet huon no tardies
travis berkenstock tardies
by far the most tardies in the class
the whole class cheers and applaudes
travis approaches the podium this is so unexpected i uh i didnt even have a speech prepared
uh but i would like to say this tardiness is not something you can do all on your own
many many people contributed to my tardiness
uh id like to thank my parents for never giving me a ride to school the l
city bus driver for taking a chance on an unknown kid and uh last but not least the wonderful crew at mcdonalds for spending hours making those egg mcmuffins without
which i might never be tardy
well if mr
berkenstock has no political messages to include in his speech ill go on
cher horowitz two tardies
do you recall the dates of these alleged tardies
cher in lawyer mode
one was last monday
hall i was surfing the crimson wave i had to haul ass to the ladies
i assume your referring to womens troubles and so ill let that one slide
thank you mr
miss giest was right about you
what do you mean
well she said that you were the only one in this school with any intelligence
cher get in here
would you tell me what the hell this is
um a second notice for three outstanding tickets
i dont remember getting a first notice
the ticket is the first notice
i didnt even know you could get tickets without a licence
oh sure you can
you can get tickets anytime
oh is that so
cher nods well not around here you cant
from this moment on you will not drive sit do anything in that jeep without a supervised driver present
and no cruisin around with dionne alright
two permits do not equal a licence
do i make myself clear
cher i expect you to become a good driver
i want to see you apply yourself
im gonna practise real hard
the scene moves to the poolside a licenced driver with nothing to do
where would i find such a loser
hey granola breath you got something on your chin
im growing a goatee
oh thats good
you dont want to be the last one at the coffee house without chin pubes
i cant tell you how much i enjoy these little chats of ours but in the interest of saving time why dont you just tell me what you want
so actually i have a permit and i can drive and all but daddy says i cant take the jeep out without a licenced driver and since your not doing
anything and all you know
what are the chances of you shutting up until you get your way
hmmm slim to none
hey james bond in america we drive on the right side of the road
you try driving in platforms
look i got to get back to school
ah you want to practise parking
whats the point
everywhere you go has valet
what class you going to
actually im going to a tree people meeting
me might get marky mark to plant a celebrity tree
getting marky mark to take time from his busy pants dropping schedule to plant trees
josh why dont you just hire a gardener
you know maybe marky mark wants to use his popularity for a good cause make a contribution
in case you have never heard of that a contribution is the giving of
excuse me but i have donated many expensive italian outfits to lucy
and as soon as i get my licence i fully intend to brake for animals and i have contributed many hours helping two lonely teachers find romance
which ill bet serves your interest more than theirs
you know if i ever saw you do something that wasnt ninety percent selfish id die of shock
oh thatd be reason enough for me
would you call me selfish
not to your face
is josh giving you shit because hes going through his post adolescent idealistic phase
look theres mr
the girls run over to mr
hall um do you drink coffee
well not from this cafeteria
but uh yes under normal circumstances
well i am such a retard
when i was packing daddys lunch this morning i gave him my lemon snapple and i took his sucky italian roast
do you want it
are you sure you dont want it
duh it might stunt my growth
i wanna be like cindy crawford
but i thought maybe you and miss giest might like it
maybe you can share it
well uh thanks
to dionne hmm
outside miss giests office she opens the door miss giest
did you sign up for the environmental fair
oh yeah we will
you have such pretty eyes
dont hide them
and these clips are so cute
and this tiny little waist
oh and dont forget to sign up for the environmental fair
not a total betty but a vast improvement
well we did our best
we gotta book it if were going to make it to p
scene moves outside cmon dee
ohh i feel like failing dude cmon
i know what you mean but at least its exercise
i feel like such a heffer
i had two bowls of special k three pieces of turkey bacon a handful of popcorn five peanut butter m ms and like three pieces of licorice
gasp oh my god
is that a photo op or what
will you look at that body language
legs crossed towards each other
thats an unequivocal sex invite
oh cher hes getting her digits
look at giest she is so cute
ohh old people can be so sweet
change lightning seeds the following scenes show miss giest and mr
hall get it on while everyone is thanking cher
the entire student body was utterly grateful for the improvement in their grades
cher whats this all about
my report card
the same semester
whatd you do
turn in some extra credit reports
you take the mid terms over
you mean to tell me that you argued your way from a c to an a
totally based on my powers of persuasion
honey i couldnt be happier than if they were based on real grades
girls just wanna have fun robert hazard i felt so satisfied i wanted to do more good deeds
dionne sneezes dee when your allergies act up take out your nose ring
there you go there you go
all right cher
earth to cher
come in cher
i would just like to say that physical education in this school is a disgrace
i mean standing in line for forty minutes is hardly aerobically effective
i doubt ive worked off the calories in a stick of care free gum
class cheers well you certainly exercised your mouth cher
now hit the ball
ball flies by inches from chers nose miss stoeger that machine is just a lawsuit waiting to happen
thanks for the legal advice
cher returns to line dionne
uh no miss stoeger
i have a note from my tennis instructor and he would prefer it if i didnt expose myself to any training that might derail his teachings
my plastic surgeon doesnt want me doing any activity where balls fly at my nose
well there goes your social life
principal walks onto the scene miss stoeger
got another one
ladies we have a new student with us
this is tai frasier
tai you dont have time to change but you could hit a few balls in those clothes
she could be a farmer in those clothes
dee my mission is clear
would you look at that girl
she is so adorably clueless
we have got to adopt her
cher she is toe up
our stock would plummet
dee dont you want to use your popularity for a good cause
motions to tai cmere
hang with us
oh thank you
how do you like california
man i am freakin
i could really use some sort of a herbal refreshment
well we do lunch in ten minutes
we dont have any tea but we have coke and stuff
you guys got coke here
yeah this is america
scene changes to the girls walking down main path unknown song and artist so we decided to show tai the ropes at bronson alcott high school
that is alanas group over there
they do the t
they think thats the most important thing on earth
and thats the persian mafia
you cant hang with them unless you own a bmw
and theres elton in the white vest and all the most popular boys in the school
including my boyfriend
aint he cute
if you make the decision to date a high school boy they are the only acceptable ones
cher which one of them is your boyfriend
chers got attitude about high school boys
its a personal choice every woman has got to make for herself
murray approaches the girls to dionne woman lend me five dollars
murray i have asked you repeatedly not to call me woman
excuse me miss dionne
ok but street slang is an increasingly valid form of expression
most of the feminine pronouns do have mocking but not necessarily in a misogynistic undertone
murray hops away wow
you guys talk like grown ups
oh well this is a really good school
im gonna go get a soda
you guys want
i cant put that cute little squeal into words scene changes to inside cafeteria my iron lung radiohead to food oh wow
to tai thats nice representation
those are really nice stickers
oh you like em
see i was thinking it was too cluttered
you know i wanna wipe all of this out and concentrate on one main decorative statement
like uh marvin the martian
get outa town
i can do marvin the martian
well i mean theres not really a lot to him
but you wanna see
thats really cool
you drew that
yeah and wait i got
you didnt trace this
heres another one over here
and lots of little guys
that is so cute
i love to draw
youre really good at it
yeah really you are
scene changes to outside are you sure thats fat free
and you lose wait by doing it like this
like really small
dionne giggles hisses its true
i met a really cool guy
alright hes got long hair hes really funny and straight off right
he offers me some smoke
there he is
are you talking about drugs
tai how old are you
ill be sixteen in may
my birthday is in april and as someone older can i please give you some advice
tai nods it is one thing to spark up a dubie and get laced at parties but it is quite another to be fried all day
do you see the distinction
loadies generally hang on the grassy knoll over there
unknown song and artist guitarish sometimes they come to class and say bonehead things and we all laugh of course
but no respectable girl actually dates them
you dont want to start off on the wrong foot do you
tai shakes her head ive got an idea
lets do a make over
dionne lights up no no
chers main thrill in life is a make over
ok it gives her a sense of control on a world full of chaos
how could anyone resist that
i have never had straight friends before
supermodel jill sobule various scenes of cher and dionne making over tai then cher and tai working out in the lounge room squeeze in
cher i dont wanna do this any more and my buns they dont feel nothin like steel
ok it will get easier i promise
just as long as we do it every day
not just sporadically
how do you know if were doing it sporadically
thats another thing tai
weve got to work on your accent and vocabulary
see sporadic means once in a while
try and use it in a sentence today
ok from now on were alternating cindy crawfords aerobicise and buns of steel and reading one non school book a week
my first book is fit or fat
mine is men are from mars women are from venus
now that takes care of our minds and bodies but we should do something good for mankind or the planet for a couple of hours
josh walks in hey brainiac
uh the dreaded ex
tai this is josh
nice to meet ya
you know about this stuff
i want to do something good for humanity
how about sterilization
tai cracks up
cher and josh enter the kitchen so what do ya think
that im devoting myself so generously to someone else
no that youve found someone even more clueless than you are to worship you
i am rescuing her from teenage hell
do you know the wounds from adolescence can take years to heal
yeah and youve never had a mother so youre acting out on that poor girl as if she was your barbie doll
freshman psych rears its ugly head hey i am not taking psych
i am going to take that lost soul in there and make her well dressed and popular
her life will be better because of me
how many girls can say that about you
josh and cher walk back to the lounge where tai is watching t
and singing along with the mentos ad
god i hate those ads
be seein ya
yeah i hope not sporadically
oh my god
do you see how boys are responding
my heart is totally bursting
travis approaches cher you have timor right
did you get a flyer
wow a party
its in the valley
the cops usually break em up in less than an hour and it takes that long to get there
and besides its just local loadies
do you guys think that travis is gonna be there
tai i thought we moved on from there
dont sell yourself short now
youve got something going for you that no one in this school has
oh im not a virgin
i mean mystery
as far as everyone is concerned you were the most popular girl in your school and the fact that you hang with dee and i well
speaks very highly of you
if you strike while the iron is hot you can have any guy that you want
i got it
he just broke up with collette
oh my god
hes way popular
hes like the social director of the crew
yeah and his dad can get you into any concert and i noticed him scoping you out
he was looking at me
he said you gave him a toothache
howd i do that
its an expression
it means he thought you were sweet
is that true
oh you are so bad
scene moves to fountain where cher is taking pictures of the crew alright supergrass ok you guys all get together
oh that is great
tai tai get a little closer
hey elton uh why dont you put your arm around tai
yeah thats great
check out chers little smile and rock
tai cmere cmere tai
scene moves to just cher and tai by bushes hold that
doesnt she look classic
yeah this is beautiful
she looks like one of those bottichellis chicks
hey why dont you make me a copy of this ok
another one of chers little squeals
this is my friend tai
get out of my chair
tai moves to opposite cher
lucy brings in dinner
thank you lucy
it looks great
what is this crap
daddy its from the cut your colesterol cook book
doctor lovitz says youve got to get down to two hundred
chers pager beeps

so uh whatd you do at school today
i broke in my purple clogs
mels phone rings
yeah yeah no no what
so check it
murrays geometry class is right by eltons locker and taped up inside was the picture you took of tai
oh my god
eltons got a picture of you hanging up in his locker
oh no shit
so anyway the whole crew is going to this party in the valley
cher hangs up the phone

in background i told you i want it in the morning

sun valley is north
all i see is bel air then youre on the wrong map
i am not on the wrong map
look at the number on the top

there are no numbers on the top
murray makes a frustrated noise
murray shut up
please dont friz out
the gang pull up outside the party
listen tai when we get there make sure elton sees you but dont say hi first
look like youre having fun and youre really popular
talk to someone in his eyeline preferably a guy
make him come to you and find an excuse to leave while hes still into the conversation
the key is always have him wanting more
you got it
i got it
does a rail slide with his skateboard on the stair rail
oh did you just see that
skateboards that is like so five years ago
oh you guys came
you want a beer
ill get you one

the girls enter the party house
unknown song and artist this is ragin
lets do a lap before we commit to a location
dionne drags a dancing girl away from murray
who was that
cher aint that the same dress that you was wearin yesterday
was that you going through my laundry
like i would really wear something from judys
do you prefer fashion victim or ensembly challenged
amber walks off
what a clone
cher you looked much better in that dress than she did
travis bursts onto the scene spilling drink on chers shoes
ruin my satin shoes why dont you
they move to the kitchen
excuse me my shoes
this is so not fixable
its a small price to pay to the party gods
look ill make amends
how about some chronic shit
oh its the least you could do
hey eltons over there
act like travis is saying something funny
tai hands joint to cher and blows smoke in her face
tai starts cracking up
whats so funny
elton approaches and reaches behind cher for the joint oh here
summer enters holding a card hey everyone
lets play suck and blow
the card passes through the group until elton drops it on purpose and plants one right on chers mouth god elton

dionne screams in the background its dee

cher answers hello

cher hangs up the phone what was that all about
she wants me to come home for spring break

i believe im you gail orange he said hed come over with some video tapes and wed watch them
a night alone with christian
i sent for reinforcements
then dee and i had to design a lighting concept and costume decisions
i dont rely on mirrors so i always take polaroids
whenever a boy comes you should always have something baking
oh im still all red
well im trying to make you as white as i can cher
look youre all flushed
you have to calm down
you know i am so glad i never did it with someone i had lukewarm feelings for
christian is brutally hot and i am going to remember tonight forever
later the door bell rings
cher opens the door hi

whats wrong with me
maybe he really was tired
i suppose it wasnt meant to be i mean he does dress better than i do
what would i bring to the relationship
get back into the right lane
whats the first thing you do
first thing i do is i put on my blinker
dionne accidently turns the wipers on oh wait shit

then i look in my mirror
ok then i glance at my blind spot
glance with your head not the whole car
i swear to god i swear to god woman you cant drive for shit

actually going all the way is like a really big decision
i cant believe i was so caprecious about it

oh there it is
alright were off

boy getting off the freeway makes you realize how important love is
after that dionnes virginity went from technical to non exisistant
i realized how much i wanted a boyfriend of my own
not that christian wasnt a blast to hang out with
he was becoming one of my favourite shopping partners
um wheres tai
oh she met some random guys at the foot locker and escorted them right over there
in distance oh my god
did you see
i dont know where she meets these barnies
i have a question alright
is it james dean or jason priestly
ok you looked hot in it
with the barnies if i fall would you guys catch me
could we please be more
tai screams stop it
bring me back up please
bring me back up
tai screams a little more then christian rescues her thank you
were just joking
someone could get killed
tai runs over and hugs cher cher you dont understand
i was just sitting there and i was just talking to those guys and then all of a sudden we were laughing and
hey are you ok
are you sure
yeah uh huh
lets get you home for some r r huh
christian laughs boy considering how clueless she was tai certainly had that damsel in distress act down
meanwhile back at school everyone was talking about tais brush with death at the mall
was it like a montage of all the scenes in your life
not exactly a montage
is it true some gang members like tried to shoot tai in the mall
that is what everyone is saying
when i was nine i fell off the jungle gym thats when i saw this light you know
move down for cher
tell me more tell me more
where was i
you were thinking about was really important
oh right right
right before you die your mind just sort of gets very clear
its a very intense spiritual thing
well i know when i was held at gun point
to tai you were saying
i dont know i cant i cant pinpoint the spirituality out for you you know if youve never experienced anything
but now i dont know how to act around him
i mean ordinarily i would strut around in my cutest little outfits and send myself flowers and candy but i couldnt do that stuff with josh
cher and josh are in the lounge watching t
whats with you
what do you mean
youre so quiet
you havent made me watch the real world
i care about the news
shows scenes from bosnia you look confused
well uh i thought they declared peace in the middle east
scene changes to mels den with cher walking past the door in her pyjamas cher get in here
whats up daddy
what are you doing dancing infront of my office
nothing i just wanted to see if you needed any help with anything
yeah you caould help me with something
come over here
every time that you see a telephone conversation that took place on september third highlight it
just september third
daddy did you ever have a problem that you couldnt argue your way out of
tell me the problem and well figure out how to argue it
i like this boy
and he likes someone else
how could that be
i dont know but i feel wretched
well obviously this boy is a complete moron
you are the most beautiful girl in beverly hills
and to tell you the truth im not sure i want you with a stupid fella like that
well actually he is a smart guy and you know hes one of those do gooder types and now i feel like all my after school commitments are just not
how can you say that
who takes care of everyone in this household
who makes sure that daddy eats right
to tell you the truth i have not seen such good doing sice your mother
now get back to work
later while we were learning about the pismo beach diaster i decided i needed a complete make over except this time id make over my soul
but what makes someone a better person
and then i realised all my friends were really good in different ways
like christian he always wants things to be beautiful and interesting
or dionne and murray when they think no one is watching are so considerate of each other
and poor miss giest always trying to get us involved no matter how much we resist
oh its just that doesnt even show
you know every single possesion every memory everything you had your whole life
gone in a second
can you imagine what that must feel like
elton raises his hand elton
