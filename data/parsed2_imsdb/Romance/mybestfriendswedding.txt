by ronald bass first draft screenplay dim lighting crowd buzz a long line of the rich the celebrated the congenitally impatient
everyone in this queue holds a reservation at least an hour overdue
tourists cant even make the line
pan ahead to
the burnished dining room the tables of power the elegant service
covertly many eyes are drawn to the one table receiving by far the most lavish service of all
captains hover presenting delicacies pouring wines murmuring obsequiously to a guest whose person they screen from our view
we can see however
the honored guests companion
ignored bemused across the table
this is digger downes darkly attractive
kind eyes an intellectuals mouth saville rows most unobtrusive and conservative chalk stripe suit
he is gay but you wouldnt guess it
loyal and wise and generous and you might
he watches with a quiet twinkle as the captains now step back revealing to us
their most unlikely icon
julianne potter almost wears her favorite bulky sweater over a bunch of other stuff she pulled together in fifteen seconds
she is unkempt quick volatile scattered and beneath it all perhaps because of it all an original beauty
dark liquid eyes a cynical mouth slender expressive fingers which point to
a variation on our squid ink risotto
trace of moselle to sweeten the stock
she doesnt like that idea at all
shoots him a sharp look of doubt that makes him smile
dont kill us on this one its a long shot
places the moist lump of black rice before her
she takes a surprisingly small amount rolls it over her tongue
makes dead flat eye contact with digger
and nods its actually quite nice
the captain breathes with relief
she turns her dark eyes to him
the tone says theyre pals
im writing it up as inventive and confident
which it is
off the record ill need an extra boat of the ink
or a salt shaker
ill toss a coin
as the captain splits digger looks around at the other tables which makes many pairs of eyes awkwardly glace away
is it ever embarrassing having your bum kissed in public
if your ass isnt chapped you are not a good writer of note
she glances at her two remaining waiters who shamelessly fawn nearby
is it sad to be an editor and bask only in reflected insincerity
ive adjusted and thanks for asking
she leans forward as if sharing something conspiratorial
see the pull of a book like twenty chefs is not who i put in
its who i leave out
which is everyone you couldnt get in
plus some guys whose food i dont like
pushes the risotte across to him
he lifts a fork
this fellow from newsday ever call
pulls a cellular out of a large jumbled bag
ill buzz my machine
inventive and confident yeh
is newsday a real interview or just some cute guy youre setting me up w
i dont send you men anymore
you dont know what to do with them
shes punching in her code
sometimes i do
like for two months
over the phone we hear her answering machine
mans voice v
and her face changes
just to hear the guileless voice
god it must be what months huh
i cant wait to talk to you
im in chicago at the ritz carlton
she looks impressed and surprised
fancy place for this guy
call me four in the morning whatever we gotta talk
as she hangs up
she still has that look in her eye
digger has never seen that and he likes it very much
the man of the moment
a sweet natural smile that makes us like her too
the bohemian sophisticate has vanished
no no the opposite
thats my best friend michael oneal
he sounds desperate to talk
the wandering sportswriter
he pushes the risotto back her way
i didnt know you two had a past
her gaze sharpens
the look in your eye
shakes her head no way
sophomore year at yale we had this one hot month
and you know me i got restless
he knows her
she got restless
so i get up the nerve to break his heart
i tell him theres this dreamy exchange student from pakistan who wants to you know
and he gets this
he says i knew i couldnt hold your interest which of course makes me feel like the shallow bitch ive always been
he nods yeah
then he says but what makes me want to cry
is im losing the best friend i ever had
hears the feeling
in her voice
and when he said it i knew
i felt the same
she covers with a smile
so i cried
for maybe the third time in my life
and i kissed him
and weve been best friends ever since
fingers turning her wine glass
nine years weve seen each other through everything
losing jobs losing parents losing lovers
travelled all over weve had the best times
the best times of my life maybe
just drinking and talking
even over a phone
no hes nothing like me
hes like you
no offense taken
hes the salt of the earth
kind and loyal and generous
the one constant thing in my life is hell always be there
hes still in love with you
that stops her
she has to say
but it never gets in the way
something she probably hasnt confessed out loud before
well he has a true friend in you
he wants her to know he sees that
whenever george tells someone how steadfast i am he always makes me sound boring
solid and genuine is not boring
michael can be completely insane
a young waiter arrives
sets a boat of black squid ink beside her plate
there was this one night in tucson like six years ago
we got amazingly drunk i mean keith richards time
the kid tops off her glass of meursault
looking at her
god i havent thought of this in so long
the waiter hanging now
i can even believe we did this
digger sees the guy listening gestures to her with his eyes
so she looks up
could you give us a minute
the kid stunned speechless
people lose jobs for a lot less
you wont miss much i promise there was no sex
he reddens and disappears
ive lost interest
he takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit cuts his fingertip takes my hand does the same to me
she places the tips of her index fingers together
he says swear
when were both if weve never been married
we marry each other
and laughs again
can you believe that
but digger isnt smiling
she wonders why
begins to spoon black squid ink onto her risotto
see he figured that would be a sign from god or someone of comparable authority that wed misunderstood our destinies
he still has this real serious look
shes still spooning ink
we never talked about it again
i dont know what made me think of
digger quietly i do
she lifts her spoon mesmerized by the gravity of his tone
youll be in three weeks
how old is he
it hits her like a ton of lead bricks
she shovels some swampy risotto into her mouth without looking
she shovels in more drippy black goop
it is really disgusting
hes not proposing marriage theres no way im buying one word of th
then why are you compulsively eating
if youre not hysterical
more goes in
her lips and mouth completely black
like a circus clown
he cant do that to me
were about to find out
ink is now dribbling out of the black hole of her mouth and down her face
she absently dabs a napkin keeping some of it from reaching her sweater
when i turn him down
she realizes the full weight of the truth
well never be the same
i have a suggestion
ill have to kill myself before i call him
staring in each others eyes
digger sadly that was it
julianne furiously scrubs her blackened tongue with a toothbrush
gray foam pours from her mouth spattering the oversized basketball jersey she wears as a nightshirt
in the mirror her troubled eyes dwell on michael flick to the cordless phone standing ominously on the closed toilet lid
she spits sticks her tongue way out
depressed terrified and disfigured for life
she snatches up the hated phone and wanders aimlessly into
west village view
defiantly jumbled aggres sively eclectic
traces of wonderful taste mixed with i like it you got a problem with that
she stumbles around rehearsing
this is awkward timing michael i just joined this convent and they never give your deposit ba
full length mirror
she straightens her hair to look her best
michael im married
and i have two weeks to live
michael im trying to be gay dont confuse me
she turns to continue pacing and walks straight into a dresser
stuns her momentarily
she punches up the number primping absently in the mirror
when it connects
i was calling michael oneal but seeing its so late i could just leave a mes
no such luck
julianne soft good evening sir
youve been enrolled in the obscene call of the month club and th
god its so good to hear your voice
she forgets herself
because its good to hear his too
ive been calling for days
yeh well my old machine kept eating messages
i tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement but finally
urgent look i have to ask you something
something so incredibly important that if you turn me down i dont know what ill d
julianne bright i just have to tell you this one thing first okay
i mean this will hand you the biggest laugh of your adult life
come on girl suck it up
i was thinking about you and i remembered this unbelievably insane night we spent together in tucson like a thousand years ago
i mean theres no way you could possibly remember the
soft are you kidding
like a brick wall
the sweetness in his voice
i think about that night all the time
shes going to have a heart attack
but its not why i called
and just as a tsunami of relief begins to sweep away
i called because i met someone
and her smiles breaks off
like a spine snapping
because there is something in his voice
well thats great
you havent really had anybody since dingbat jennylee
you dont understand
ive never felt this way about anybody
she sits down hard
right on the floor
and shes all wrong for me
i mean shes a junior at chicago university shes twenty years old
like when i first met you
juliannes mouth is suddenly dry
and her dad is like this billionaire who owns the white sox and some cable empire and you know how ive always been miserably awkward around those kinda stuffed suits
shes finally making her mouth work
but theyre so down to earth such wonderful people
youve met her parents
were getting married
theres a knife in her heart
she can scarcely breathe
michael its wednesday night you cant possibly be getting married on su
actually it all starts tomorrow
its one of those four day weddings with all the traditional events and ten million people flying in from madagascar such
julianne incredibly lame arent you
working this weekend
i mean is that responsible
well the sox are at home
sis letting me do a profile on the big hurt
barely audible thomas yeh
shes staring at herself in the mirror
a straw to lunge at
well maybe we should talk ab
i need you
a lifetime of emotion welling in her eyes
if you cant come
and hold my hand
ill never get through this
please come please
i cant wait for you to meet her
hold on julianne
staring in the mirror
like watching the end of her life
the closet the armoire all the drawers are wide open
two huge suitcases open on the bed into which julianne is flinging clothes as she fumbles to smoke and dial at the same time
over the phone now
machine youve reached digger and george
brevity will be appreciated
julianne in a rage snatches up a tiny clingy sexy dress
pouts at it
she holds the dress against her body
she clicks off
checks the dress in the mirror
raises the short skirt a little higher
digger driving the open air cherokee up the ramp to united airlines departures
julianne wind whipped trying to light a fresh cigarette from the butt of the last one
he glances over
hates to see this
you cant get lung cancer and die in four days
go to plan b
she sucks deep
you have no appropriate sense of emergency
my best friend is ruining his life
no hes ruining yours
if you love someone its your duty to save them from themselves
you have a real philosophy of life
its called the law of love asshole
she is tight enough to snap
and at the edge of tears
staring out at the skycaps clinging to her cigarette as he eases to the curb
digger gently why dont we have a drink
you could catch a later fl
im a busy girl
ive got four days to break up a wedding and steal the brides fella
she finally looks at him
he doesnt say anything
hes adored me for nine goddamn years
i can see why
she knows him maybe five seconds plus she has billions of dollars plus shes perfect so dont go feeling sorry for miss pre teen illinois
so her voice softens
which shows the hurt
and dont go feeling sorry for me you dont know me that well
were only friends
digger softly i stand corrected
stand in her eyes
im making a big mistake huh
digger shrugs maybe youll learn something
he wraps his hand over hers
she looks down at it
im gonna bring him back man
against all odds yknow
cos if i dont
she wraps her fingers around his
i gotta live with it forever
looks in his eyes
and at my wedding
ill be the only bride with her own best man
and she kisses his cheek
jumps out of his car
before she cries
yanks her bags from the back
they trade small salutes
and then shes gone
the jetway disgorging passengers into the swarming ant colony called ohare
julianne lugging multiple carry ons trying to pull fly away strands of hair into place nervous as a schoolgirl looking all around and
there he is
michael is tall and square shouldered a boyish grin an unruly shock of hair
he looks gorgeous sweet and just dangerous enough to be irresistible
his face lights to see her and she
runs to his arms shedding bags along the way slamming off heedless civilians to be
swept off the earth in strong arms spun around laughing like crazy their cheeks tight together
when he sets her down
he kisses her nose
his arms are still around her
michael murmurs can you believe it
can you believe im actually gonna do this
julianne lost in his eyes not hardly
she follows his gaze and
there she is
kimberly wallace is small and slender but it is a body to die for
the face is striking not at all perky and vapid but lovely and interesting
worst of all intelligent
she walks toward them purposefully her eyes locked to the woman in her fiancees arms
at the last moment michael releases julianne and kimmy
throws her arms around the startled visitor
holds her tight with such genuine warmth that julianne can only slowly hug back
as michael beams
this just makes everything so perfect
her arms stay around the slightly dazed julianne
the younger girl leans close confides
all ive heard from the day i met michael is julianne this and julianne that
i think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you
pale gray eyes
alive with joy and intimacy
ive never had a sister
kimmy tearing down the throughway in her mercedes sl a dashing confident driver
julianne riding shotgun hair flying a total wreck in the open convertible
michael is happily crouched on the little platform behind their seats hugging his knees
the roar of the wind makes it impossible for him to hear them
my hearts in my throat here
right off i have to ask this monstrous favor
you need a few dollars
kim glances over
at eighty miles an hour
a bittersweet look
just like he said
her eyes at once admiring and regretful
i can be quick
i can even be funny
shakes her head
an endearing youngster
but i cant be dry
can you watch the road
its in the delivery
she looks back to the highway
this is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav
you want a menage on your wedding night
kimmy straight back no that wouldnt be burdensome
julianne studying the delicate angular profile
hard not to like this kid
my classmate angelique shattered her pelvis line dancing in abeline on spring break
the sweetest smile
be my maid of honor
julianne just blinks
you cant believe what itd cost to bring in a temp
how about promoting a bridesmaid
someone you know for at least forty five minutes
we cut off a huge semi who blasts his horn
kimmy fearless oblivious and analytical
the bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty
identical twin debutantes from nashville who are basically vengeful sluts
with amazing bodies
which was the disqualifying factor
the twin part
i like to remain impartial in my contempt
sees the off ramp and slices across four lanes of speeding bullets in a heart stopping nanosecond
this kid could drive for penske
julianne has to pound her chest to get her heart started
looks back to see if michael fell out
he is absurdly wind blown
gives her a beautiful grinning thumbs up
loves this stuff
this means i have four days to make you my new best friend
brings juliannes eyes back
and since i already know everything about you
including intimate facts im mortified to have heard but too envious to forget
its time for you to learn about me
easing off the freeway
she meets juliannes glance
to get personal
julianne smiles sounds like a plan
the place is stunning
high ceiling soft light large rococo mirrors louis quatorze sofas and chairs
michael wanders rest lessly fish out of water among designer displays and stylish female patrons
takes a look at his watch
a period sitting room ringed with mirrors along its tapestried walls
kimmy sits on a louis treize loveseat next to a stack of costly gowns
watching with an expertise beyond her years as
julianne stands on a platform
a seamstress fitting her into a sleek pale daffodil colored gown
there are pins everywhere as the seamstress struggles toward a perfect fit
continuously looking to kim for approval
if youd rather the lilac
julianne shakes her head
this one is beautiful
i thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress
you wont be comfortable unless youre distinctive
julianne glances over
what else did he tell you
you hate weddings you never go
youre not up for anything conventional or popularly assumed to be female priorities
and she stops
not wanting to offend
julianne quietly not even love
the look holds
the seamstress keeps working as if shes deaf
thats why michael and i were the wrong fit
right from the start
he said that too
she stands up
walks to the platform
smooths her hand over the fabric down juliannes back along her hips
communicating to the seamstress with her irritated expression
well i thought i was like you
and proud to be
until i met rumpled smelly old michael
pins start to come out
kimmy points these too
and then i found i was just a sentimental schmuck
like all those flighty nitwits id always pitied
she leans forward
so they can look at each other
funny world huh
it is that
i need a smoke
and before anyone can breathe she steps off the platform ripping the living shit out of the gown right down the side
the seam stress eyes flash open in abject horror
julianne a deer in headlights looks quickly around at the evidence of her screw up in six different mirrors
kimberly just steps to her fingers the tear
its mostly the seam
lets get this to carlos
and unzips julianne down the back
in her rush to step out julianne stumbles but her arms are pinned by the pulled down dress and she just
topples like a felled oak thudding on her face the gown ripping some more the seamstress screaming like an idiot
julianne looking up helplessly a trussed hog bound in her dress
kimmy firm just
like you talk to a three year old
deftly kimmy pulls the dress free leaving julianne in her underwear
signals to the seamstress lets go
dont you have to be somewh
just my bridal shower
and michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at comiskey for a one thirty game
opens the door
other than that
julianne sits on the loveseat in her bra and panties lighting one cigarette from the butt of another
suddenly she hears
an argument outside the door
strains to listen
it does sound like michael and kim
we cant make out the words
she jumps up dashes for the door stubbing her toe on the platform shit
falls heavily against the door with a thud that makes her wince and
the argument stops
she opens the door a crack
opens it wider to reveal
a teenaged boy looking right at her
he sends a true shit eating grin and she slams the door hard enough to rattle walls
she paces furiously helplessly arms around her half naked self until
the door opens a crack and her daffodil gown comes through it
come in and shut the
because its michael who has entered
with the dress
so he does
she flushes and snatches up her own clothes which were characteristically tangled in a heap and tries desperately to untangle them enough to cover herself
he is amazed and amused by her embarrassment
michael laughing should i turn around or someth
michael im in my underwear
shes tearing at her clothes only making more of a mess
weve seen each other a lot more naked than this
she seems ready to rip her clothes apart so he gently takes them from her hands
she tries to stand unselfconsciously as he easily untangles them
i mean we were skinny dipping in greece just as pals less than two years ago
she grabs the clothes and covers the front of herself
looking at him with a mix of emotions she couldnt begin to sort out
things are different now
he looks in her eyes
and nods a little sadly
guess they are
michael softly well
i leave with two thoughts in my mind
he walks to the door
puts his hand on the latch
michael even softer youre still a very pretty girl
the look holds
there is such feeling on both sides she doesnt know what to make of it
whats the sec
and hes gone
she looks around at six different views of her uncovered backside
the parking valets wait by their stand as the convertible pulls up
these girls must be late for something the way theyre jumping out of the car
luckiest guy in the northern fucking hemisphere is all im s
because im a little understand
most sentimental schmucks i pity want a honeymoon after their wedding
just to top it off
the valet gives kimmy her ticket
i cant expect the nba to hold up the playoffs
theyre walking fast toward the garage elevators
im excited sports illustrated gave him this kind of shot hes only there a ye
so your honeymoon is exactly where
if san antonio sweeps sacramento we could start there
or depending on indiana clevel
garden sports all
little swing of maybe fifty degrees fahrenheit represents a packing challenge but theres fine food and cocktails at a choice of embassy suit
at the elevator
kimmy slams the button
its his career im supportive
look ive been everywhere ive seen the world ive laid on a beach
i want to be with the man i love
thats what makes it a honeymoon
end of story
im just saying hes lucky
an empty elevator arrives
they get in
takes one woman in a billion to put up with his array of shit
the guy is a one man festival of idiosync
kimmy slams the penthouse button
looks at her calmly
youve been introduced to the symphonic range of
his snoring yeah
he says its worse than ever
that snaffle one
julianne imitates an incredibly annoying high pitched snarl
well now it has this sorta phlegm rattle behind it
stopped at the lobby
a family of four gets in
oblivious kimmy demonstrates the phlegm rattle
really gets into it
as the family watches julianne tries her own version
more like this
the family is looking at each other
cigars in bed
i broke him on that
but the bathrooms a swamp he wears reeboks to dinner tells the same admittedly funny jokes three hundred times
sucks in a breath
loves action movies subscribes to playboy for godsake reads over my shoulder cant keep track of the checks he writes
the family gets out
the door closes
he sucks soup through his front teeth
a trademark move dont touch it
but he sure can kiss
its been awhile
ill take your word
after two weeks of cataloguing all his faults i made a command decision that changed my life
she slams the emergency stop button
we jolt to a halt
i threw the list away
shakes her head
hes not a balance sheet so many wonderful qualities so many faults
from her heart
and loving him means loving all of this
do you get nervous in small confined spaces
so its sweet of you to be protective
let me rephrase that
but nothing ever could ever did give me a moments pause about this marriage
do you get hysterical in small confined spa
youll always be there
in his mind
the perfect creature he loved for all those y
well perfection can get wearing after whi
im not joking
i had to face up to all my competitive drives and believe me ive got em
and the answer was so simple
i was gonna predict that
youre enshrined in his heart and memory
which works out great
ive missed a step
he has you on a pedestal
and me in his arms
lunges for the emergency button yanking it so hard it comes off in her hand
a terrifying buzzer ensures
jesus were trapped
no this happened to me once almost it was excruciating
begins banging random buttons out of control
kimmy watching this
julianne looks wildly up
theres a panel up there you could boost me
ripping off her platform shoes
you know how little air is in these things
ive seen statistics
once youre trapped between floors
kimmy taps her
points to the lighted panel
it says ph theyve reached the penthouse
then the door is jammed
takes a heavy platform and begins banging the metal door with all her strength sending resounding booms throughout the area as kimmy reaches and
presses door open
the metal doors part opening directly onto the banquet room just as a mighty blow comes down and the platform flies from juliannes hand straight between
two identical stunning young women serving as twin hostesses for the shower
a beat of mutually stupefied looks and we hear the shoe crash somewhere to a small spattering of shrieks
mah gawd its the bride and the woman shell nevah live up to
kimmy mutters to julianne that would be us
did she say th wrong thang agin
it is so in character
amanda and samantha newhouse year old twins
true southern belles with the faces of angels and bodies made for hot oil wrestling
mandys hair is dyed ash blonde sammys is amber
otherwise the experience is similar
thrusts out her hand im julianne potter and
wed be the vengeful sluts
we came in complementary colors
have you sized up the groomsmen jules
you get first fuck
dont pick the short hairy rich one
unless he has a hump
the girls cast identical blank looks at kimberly
kimmy to the sluts dry
i told you
is this michaels julianne
all eyes turn to an elegant woman of barely
she has her daughters hair and eyes and slender form
but the bearing rules half an empire
fonda would envy
im isabelle wallace and my handsome new son scarcely did you justice girl
she takes both of juliannes hands and our heroine is sort of magically charmed
as if touched by glinda the good witch of the north
now my husband says to scoot you over to the ballpark so you can hang with michael
but first you have to meet a lot of really old women
looking warmly in her eyes
that is if youve absorbed enough profanity
flicks a glance at the twins
leads julianne off
pouting we sayed one fuck
cab crawling toward comiskey park through stifling traffic
julianne oblivious cellular to her ear
do you hear me
digger are you the
i dont know hit men whoopee cushions saltpeter something
the girl is impossibly impregnable
even i want her to get the guy
tell him the what
she shakes her head
what a guy
may i never get
game in progress
watched by michael three groomsmen his age two middle aged men and one bodyguard
suddenly a dull thumping at the door
it keeps up
they finally all look over
the bodyguard gets the door revealing
which of you gents ordered two beers
one single tray
holding fourteen beers
balancing on one hand
michael jumps up terrified at the impending mayhem this sight suggests
lemme give you a ha
julianne sweetly michael
youll unwittingly imply that im clumsy
he stops in his tracks
the guys whistle
think of that
and as well as i know you
she goes first to the bodyguard
sorry maam im on duty
julianne lovely smile its miss
that leaves two for me
heads down the row
julianne potter this is hank and gerry from si and you know daniel
shes nodding flawlessly plucking two beers each from perimeter of the tray keeping the rest perfectly balanced in the center
michael is flat dumbstruck
next a tall patrician gentleman with rolled up sleeves on his hand stitched silk shirt
this is my father in law walter
once again she gracefully plucks two beers for the distinguished father in law
how are you doing this
youre on drugs
sets them down
the man has a smile wonderful in its ease
if he gives you grief ill have him skillfully beaten where the wounds wont show
i guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question
under the circumstances
charmed to know you jules
nice meeting you too walt
a nod between equals
she moves on
and this guy you know
she sure does and effortlessly balancing her one hand load she dips to kiss a porky balding guy with big time shoulders
straight on the lips
they go way back
he is uncomfortable at this rich mans wedding even as gracious as everyone has been
his watering eyes twinkle at her and the voice has a trace of boston
you gonna be my boys best man
despite shouts from the others
best everything joe
but im going to dance with you
you dont dance
you learn to dance
her innocent smile
youve never seen
big reaction from the guys as she heads toward michael with the last of the beers not looking down at the fielders mitt which lies right in her path and
as his lips part to scream a warning she skips
neatly around it
hes in shock
youre an impostor
what have you done with my best friend
as he takes away the remaining beers
and how was the hot dog
his eyes fix on her left breast
huge mustard stain
she cant believe it
cheap and unnecessary
we were looking anyway
michael and julianne sit with their beers on the edge of the luxury box roof
the game the stadium spread out beneath them
yet they are alone in the world
she dangles her legs and we can hear her kicking the glass below
i just admire your maturity thats all
i mean there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring
day after day year after year
see thats what i thought at first
how can you like someone that perfect
no potential for long range livability
drinking their beers
side by side
both stare only at the game
the closer i watched the more the fault came into focus
each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability
shes too genuine
how can you trust someone you can never mistrust
never look at each other
no matter how many times i leave the toilet seat up she forgets and puts it down
endearingly absent minded
my very point
heres another one
shakes his head
this one really gets him
she makes the bed
quite the little eccentric
at first i thought it was a gag but shes always done it
this is not the ammunition julianne was hoping for
is there a coup de grace in here somewh
she finds him personable
can that kind of defect be passed on genetically
she looks over now
and michael is looking back
smiling the most wonderful smile
her reaction shows that she thinks its for her until
she has a few good traits
hating herself for asking but seeing no way out
gimme like eight and nine off the top ten list
first girl i ever knew
who lets me give her a bath
the look in his eyes
she can hardly bear it
and when i hug her even in public
i dont have to let go right away
she lets me hold her as long as i want
he seems so deeply in love
nice kid dont you think
a slow nod
looks like from here
a slender black woman sings a soaring gospel number backed by three ladies who could each solo in any church choir
it is mesmerizing stirring transcendent
the unseen audience clapping fiercely in rhythm shouting support
slow pan now
every face is black
we arent in church at all but a venerable blue club
one of those places youd swear everybodys played from robert johnson to bessie smith and back again
as the song ends there is applause some rapping on tables with their knuckles or their drunks
we keep panning to a far corner
julianne leans across her beer to kimmy
howd you find this pl
kim shaking her head
looks admiringly to michael
lived here my whole life never heard of it
until our first date
she reaches slender fingers
traces one back along his hair
he finds all these spots everywhere he goes its a mystical gift
michael shy jesus one d back from the bears knows a place
its not just clubs
this guy always knows the best everything
the best guitar store the best beef ribs the best horowitz record was he always like the
the best dim sum the best camping stuff
stop were embarrassing h
best valley in new zealand best
i tried those on
when you werent looking
now hes grinning at julianne
and she likes that a lot
where was that florence huh
together in the memory
as kimmy watches
me hanging on behind in the rain all night
till the gas ran out
and the first sniff of left out
i love florence
juliannes eyes flicker
could this be a teensy opening
keeps her eyes her easy smile and her killer instincts trained on michael
take her there
he nods okay
i mean now
shes perky she deserves a honeymoon
he draws a breath
if san antone sweeps sacramento
what is this shit
you gotta get off the road by september anyway when does fall quarter start
and the happy couple look at each other
they are awkward
juliannes heart soar like eagle
im not coming back
for senior year
could this be
the mother lode
dont architects find a degree sort of
the couple still staring in each others eyes
well the school will be here
architecture will still be around
i travel every week
college ball motor sports training camps
the most important thing
is being together
and she smiles
im just a baby
ive got all
in the world
michael putting kim in the back of a cab
as julianne watches
because i could come
to the twins soiree
so they can paw you and drool
julianne calls out helpful theyre gonna drool anyway
he kisses her tenderly through the open window
she waves past him at julianne
kimmy to both enjoy each other
and drives off
as he watches after julianne comes up behind him
slips her hand up onto his shoulder muscle
starts giving a little massage
should i whistle down a cab
hey cabs are expensive
im cheap remember
turns his head to see her
shes still rubbing his shoulder
about the dumbest things
share a smile
as always it covers a lot of years
the els right down the street
unless youre afraid of the neighborhood
she looks around
it is an issue
but she remembers
im always safe with you
she means that
he takes her by the hand
they begin walking
pretty amazing girl youve got
make that kind of sacrifice
what leaving school
all of it
shes leaving her family her friends everything she knows
shes putting her career on hold and she seems a pretty ambitious driven kind of pers
michael quietly in her way
all to follow you in this dumb job where you travel weeks a year to college station texas and such
its not a job for a grown man michael peter pan never married
hes let go of her hand now
looking down at the pavement before him fists in his jacket pockets
julianne softly i dont think shes naturally the
arent you afraid shes gonna choke on this stand by your man shit after awhi
michael real quiet no
hit a nerve
this is promising
i mean walter owns the sox cable sports
most girls in her spot would be angling to get daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t
she would never
even think of that
juliannes geiger counter is going berserk
i guess youre right
that would be deceitful
i got the point
he looks over at her
no smile on his face
an edge we havent seen
alls fair in love and w
that would be a girl
i dont even know
theyve reached the stairs to the el
a rickety train rattles above them
as they start up she slips her arm around his waist
julianne murmurs forgive me okay
i was talkin crazy
he slides his arm around her shoulder
they climb out of frame
close on a shallow pool of water in a bathroom sink
green powder pouring in a hand swirling it around until
its albanian i think
one of those
i bought it downstairs
it becomes truly disgusting lumpy green mud
i figure what the hell
can it make me look worse
follow the hand up as it slathers the shit across her face in great green dripping gobs
shes juggling the wall phone trying to keep it mudless as she assures digger
dig of course
of course of course of course of course i have a plan
more green slime
the julianne we know disappears
i ask myself what would lucy ricardo do in this situa
desecrates three hotel towels wiping her hand
well one worked once
throws them in the bathtub
fastidiousness a short suit
ricky wouldnt let her in the show
reaches for her toothbrush absently
all her attention is on the conversation and the hideous green face in the mirror
i recall it differently but we digress
without looking picks up a tube of hotel shampoo
so in the version youre ethel with better fashion instincts
squeezes it all over the toothbrush
this puts you in charge of plan b the unprincipled and insanely dangerous back up plan
lifts it toward her mouth liquid shampoo dripping from the bristles
in case simple lying doesnt work
at the last second
we dont know why because shes still never looked at the brush
what happens if you brush your teeth with shampoo
turns on the tap
tries to scrub the toothbrush clean and drops the phone into the green swamp which spatters all over her front
shes stymied agitated circling the sink leaning down to it
she sets the toothbrush down in her toiletries kit
decides to yank on the phones cord and the receiver springs out bopping her in the face
shes so filthy at this point she just wipes it clean on her nightshirt
this is one of those problem phones
lifts the toothbrush and tube of paste from her kit
you know guys from sports illustrated yes
i mean you can walk right in there
squeezes on the paste lifts the brush to her mouth
you could get access to letterhead for example
jams it in her mouth brushing as
julianne mouthful or even maybe their fax
the funniest look on her face
down to the toothpaste tube
which says ben gay
julianne and kimmy cruise the stately display cases
everywhere the tiffany logo the silent watchful staff in morning coats
as they browse julianne takes a blueberry danish from a paper sack and begins to eat
the staff notices
so does kim
its an homage thing
awkward girls grow up on audrey hepburn movies
you wouldnt understand
but wipes a blue glob from juliannes face
anyway i think youre wrong
what you were saying before
about michaels job
i forgot i even said th
i just think youre wrong is all
forget i brought it up
points to some jade pins
kimmy wrinkles her nose
i mean he loves his job
bad games bad towns bad pay bad flights bad hotels real bad food
homeless rootless lonely maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four
whats not to love
none of this is lost on kimmy
shes wondered the same
but he always says
whatever is manly and independent
kim nods slowly
way ahead of her
why would he trade that for running say a big piece of the pr at a powerful complex challenging conglomerate like your dads
kim stares back
a strange look
thats just the sort of thing my father and i discussed
julianne just blinks
im not stupid
say how about this
pointing to tiny golden scissors in the novelty case
kim so absorbed by the main topic she has to force herself to focus on
for the twins
what in the world is th
gold nose hair clippers
points to the tiny hand lettered sign
kimmy shrugs not quite it
so you dont think michaels as happy with his job as
julianne points to a matched pair of large
gold dog collars
they dont have dogs
kim nods oh
but cant keep her mind off
you think hed accept
a job like that
by any yardstick that involves sanity it would be the greatest thing that ever happened to him
present company excepted
kimmy nodding slowly
her yearing achingly apparent
on the other hand hes proud
last thing a man wants to admit is being trapped in a dispiriting dead end job that can never support a family
a very sweet smile
throw a man a life preserver
hell say thanks anyway id rather drown
kim nods again
they are so bonded at this moment
one almost has to
what you said
make it appear that hes doing you the favor
kimmy bites her lip
her eyes go down
self conscious to admit
i couldnt really
after you know
her voice trails off
julianne kind but wise lying
all the time
that brings the gray eyes up
julianne bats her dark ones
oh darling my pitiful desires and ambitions are dirt beneath the manly boots of your priorities
kimmy has to smile small
a self awe gal
julianne pouring it on two hundred seedy motels a year
dinners out of vending machines
waiting for you in vermin infested corridors of dark crotch rot locker rooms
this stuff makes me hot
the very words ive used
julianne thinks it over
kimmy waits for guidance
we make dad your co conspirator
michael does a favor for walter
walters reorganizing his public relations needs a brilliant guy whos close to him who he can completely trust
hope overriding reason
so you beg
michael please do this for daddy please please please blah blah blah
its only for six months
it would mean so much to me to help him out
turns up her palms
hell see right through it
if he wants to
they share a smile
in six months hell be happy settled successful
he wont get mad huh
may i be of any help whatsoever
mooney is the most gracious brit salesperson ever to offer kindness intelligence and thoughtfulness to a customer
he is large sixty with disappearing hair watering eyes and a manner that makes you think of immediately hiring a butler
bridesmaid gifts for two well assertive outspoken tennessee debutantes
kimmy still focused he wont be mad
julianne to mooney nothing here seems to quite capture their distinctive personalities
something customized perhaps
we can fashion most any item from gold
an object that might represent what is closest
to their heart
kimmy under her breath dont even think dildo
julianne digs through her jumbled bag
could you do this
tossing an object on the counter
it is a mastercard
a gold one
kimmy softly bingo
they smile at each other
more bonded than ever
you dont think hell be mad
can julianne even make herself do this
you can live a lie
in a fabulous selection of red roof inns
or you can make one desperate stab at hap
i just dont want to freak him out
what do you think
julianne stares into the soft gray eyes
its now or never
the smile of a dear sister
how mad could he get
julianne enters with a really nervous kimberly in tow
approaches the maitre d
we close to hear
wallace and his guests have retired to the humidor
points to an escalator leading to the mezzanine
behind a glass wall what looks like a british mens club
thirty guys and a billion cigars
as julianne starts toward it
she turns back
loves this shit
its unofficial of course
but traditionally the humidor is for gentlemen only
ive got this girlfriend at the justice department
with all this time on her hands
her look is every bit as hard as his
he gestures to the escalator
she takes kimmys hand and up they go
we can see walter in a big leather chair enjoying a major stogie
kimmy licks her lips
every head turns
a nice range of reactions from offended to attracted and points in between
julianne murmurs piece of cake
ill hang and think happy thoughts
heads over toward her father
julianne walks confidently even provocatively to the wall lined with bins of cigars
every eye in the place is on her butt
she runs her fingers over a few contenders
plucks one out examines it puts it back
walks a little farther
selects another big and black
rolls it expertly in her fingers
sniffs along its length
a guy comes over
could be successful a brokers pin stripe
nearly as attractive as he thinks he is
know what youre looking for little lady
little lady huh
she glances at his coven of buddies who pretend not to notice
then straight to the guys blue eyes
i asked first
she holds up her cigar
i like em long and hard
runs it under her nose
smell is important im a believer in that
takes a match from a cut crystal bowl
but you never know what youve got
till you run your tongue over it
and she does
moistening the full length of the cigar
the boys are laughing openly
she strikes the match
as she lights up
what youre looking for in a man
she glances at his wedding ring
then straight into his eyes
actually im partial to married gentlemen
the way she says that
the guy swallows
we can see some of the air has been sucked from the room
why is that
its so much time
when i phone the wives
explosive laughter from the peanut gallery
as she jams the big clemente churchill into her mouth she sees kimmy waving her over from across the room
without even looking at the guy shes just put away
she crosses the room walter stands politely looking very dapper very powerful and focusing on her with considerable interest
he waits until she sits on the edge of a costly leather hassock
simply your idea
she cant read this guy
maybe thats how he built an empire
she nods yeah
youre a woman of insight
he sits on the arm of his chair
close enough to speak quietly
my wife and i love this marriage and deplore its circumstances
he puffs his cigar
julianne puffs her
kimmy looks on a kid watching the grown ups
as you guessed my daughter is unhappy about giving up her life
and in my opinion cowardly in avoiding the necessary confrontation
then he stops
as if reading juliannes eyes
mike has a world of ability
id do anything to have him in my company
one more puff
except ask him
julianne is a little stunned
kimmy looks helpless
hed resent it
and most important kim
no smile on his lips
hes a great kid but hes still a kid
instead of recognizing that his resistance comes from insecurity hed turn it to anger
to protect himself
spreads his hands
from realizing that hes ignoring my daughters needs despite how very much he loves her
he looks to his daughter now
they both have some growing up to do
but theyre good people theyre starting with love
theyve got time
softly i think youre making a mistake sir
his eyes come back to her
a little sharply
and that interests me
how someone who knows him so well could be so wrong
a formidable guy
she meets his gaze
see i love him too as much as anyone here
and for a whole lot longer
from her heart
i think i know best what would make him happy
julianne fully dressed sits on the closed lid of a toilet seat
the stall is tiny enough to arouse claustrophobia in an astronaut
her cellular phone pressed to her ear she is listening angrily smoking ferociously every call in her body running at red line
okay okay okay okay i hear you all right
she closes her eyes
it is stupid dishonest desperate beyond belief and cant possibly ever work
it can only end in humiliation and disgrace
now can i say two words
deep drag on the cigarette
shes striped her gears
all right twelve words
julianne exits the stall
to face three black teenage girls
just staring at her
supportive you do it girl
julianne nods to the kids
they nod back
she exits the restroom into
we are in the middle of the brookfield zoo
and sitting on a bench eating popcorn from a bag
what was going on in there
some crazy person
michael and julianne walking together
hes eating his popcorn
she carries a cardboard container with nachos a gooey fudge waffle cone and a large drink
youre not eating
i never eat when im serene
you never eat when youre despondent
i switched that around when you werent looking
she swirls a single nacho chip in cheese
but her heart isnt in it
last zoo we were in was
the rhinos were fucking
boy those were the days
and when she looks over
his eyes are waiting
softly yeah they were
theyre passing the hippo pen
but they dont notice
that was nice
the way you said that
so was that
hes feeling restless something
doesnt know quite what to say
its weird being the groom
all these things kimmy has to take care of
you need a baby sitter
thats what im here for
he holds her eyes
then looks down
and the way hes doing it begins to excite her
he looks up neither one of them noticing that as they walk she is about to
crash into a chest high metal stand that displays animal facts
we have followed him as she is wiped from frame
his face from shock
now theres my girl
pan back to see her wearing everything from her cardboard container
nachos fudge sauce diet coke the works
it is really awful
kids bystanders laughing cruelly
her eyes fill with tears and she tries bravely to smile against it
see i can only do it with beer
he takes out his handkerchief
and with that and his hands gently scoops the worst of the mess off her
the fact that hes touching her breasts and her body is something they pretend not to notice
she laughs softly and a few tears fall even though she doesnt know why
such an odd raw confusing moment
to the world looking on they are lovers
murmurs see better already
and he kisses her face
not quite her lips
but only an inch away
we can feel her heart pounding
he strips off his shirt only a tank top underneath
well go back to the bathroom youll put this on
she sniffles okay
bet youre glad im here to take care of you
he puts his arm around her
bet i am
holds her close as they start toward the restroom
hope that crazy persons not still there
were on their backs
she doesnt scare me
julianne in t shirt and shorts rushes onto the deck of a sprawling beach club
clutching her bag she quickly surveys the scene
the entire beach has been taken over by the wedding party
young folks old folks little kids maybe people
we scan with her to find a crowd around
a three on three volleyball game
kimmy and two groomsmen on one side facing michael and the tennessee debs
the twins wear spectacular bikinis and are surprisingly athletic as well as predictably uninhabited
as the next point begins kimmy serves
sammy in back makes a nice dig lobbing to mandy who sets for michaels vicious spike straight through his best mans hapless defense
the crowd cheers michael and as he turns mandy gives him a savage
chest bump of congratulation that any nfl linebacker would be proud of
it puts the surprised michael straight on his butt
the twins pull him up and sammy gives him a hot kiss on his ear that makes the crowd react
kim plays good sport
julianne watches michaels body for a beat then
down the beach several barbecue grills have been set up
manned by beach club staff and family alike
michaels pop joe is dispensing beers from a keg
kims mom isabelle is coordinating the beans potato salad and corn on the cob table
julianne races across the sand to
a huge smoky grill where walter is basting baby back ribs clearly enjoying himself
julianne runs up to him says something into his ear
he looks at her
then turns his station over to a club steward and follows julianne down toward the lakeside
as they stroll together shes a little breathless
hes watching her profile curious silent
at the waters edge
whispers is anybody watching
i hope so
this is all too mysterious to waste on just me
she reaches into her big bag
pulls out a single folded sheet of paper
i picked up michaels messages for him at our hotel
i stole one
his face darkens
the easy smile fades
he holds up his palms
julianne reading my son in laws mail is not something
sir this is important
havent you ever in your life cut one corner to make something important turn out right
his smile returns
just a little
matter of fact thats how i got married
the look holds
she thrusts the paper out
he still doesnt take it
its a fax from sports illustrated from ben isaacson michaels boss
quickly i know ben
she opens the paper
we still have no answer to our e mail of wednesday
which option do you select
i dont mean to rush you but personnel needs to tie up the loose ends
he takes the paper
we see it now
i think hes been fired
it doesnt say th
hes said some things over the past few weeks
look this is why i came up with the idea of you offering him a job
he looks up
and why i couldnt say anything before in front of kim
she bites her lip
seems so earnest
i just think of how
desperate he must be feeling
hes marrying a rich mans daughter and hes about to become destitute
you know the kind of job market hell be facing
and you think hes kept this to himself
hes too proud to beg for help
and if you wait till this comes out your offer will be like charity
hes staring at her
but his mind is working behind his eyes
if you do it now its like hes helping you
he can accept with dignity
he taps the paper with the back of his knuckles
this fax could mean
any number of things
she knows that
i should call ben
then it could all come out sooner or later
nobody should be in on this
just you and me
or more correctly i
she takes the paper back
what if what if i could find that e mail
the long straight look
maybe hes hooked
i never noticed
kimmy has your eyes
tall gangly young desk clerk
lank hair pimples
he looks up beams to see
shes flirting her ass off
you still havent straightened that tie
and she reaches across the desk with her lovely slender hands
does it for him
her fingers brush his chest on the way back
we can assume a woody
you know my friend the one whose message i picked up
his eyes flick toward his stately female supervisor helping another guest across the way
well hes still with the wedding party
and he asked me to get something he needs real badly from his room
the boy swallows hard
if you could just let me ha
see that woman
not only does julianne see her
the woman is looking back while shes talking to her customer
not a pleasant look
she said if i ever pull a stunt like that again
youll lose your job
tear my pecker off
is what she said
an elevator opens revealing julianne carrying a gym bag
she looks down the long hallway sees a maids cart
heads the other way briskly to
a small alcove
opens the gym bag pulling out a bath towel
begins to yank her top up over her head
the young maid now pushing her cart down the hall wheels squeaking and from nowhere
julianne darts into her path barely covered by the towel held tight across her she is grinning blushing
the maid can only blink
i locked myself out please hurry
and looks frantically up the hall mortified that any moment a stranger could happen upon her predicament
her eyes dart back to the maid
the maid just stares
uno cinco does ses
julianne alone in his room looking around frantically
no worries about this guy making his bed every day stuff clothes strewn everywhere the bathroom looks like a cherry bomb just detonated
shes tramping through a bachelors debris wearing only her towel looking looking
there it is
the corner of his laptop sticking out from beneath a discarded bedspread
she snatches it up opens it sets it on the cluttered desk and
there are wallet sized snapshots of kimmy
some as a little girl
some with michael
and next to them
the plastic fold out wallet inset
that he has not yet quite rearranged
so she picks it up
leafs through until she finds what she was praying would be there
michaels arm around her
on the deck of a boat
they have drinks in their hands
happiness in their eyes
and she stares at it
jesus god how long has he carried this around
she flips through further all the rest have her in them
maybe half a dozen
her heart is throbbing
her eyes are damp
back to the one on the boat
she slips it from the plastic window
puts it back where it belongs
punches up the goddamn laptop
this is it girl
do or die
murmurs you wouldnt change your password would you
you never change anything
those words make her bite her lip
damn im becoming a senti mental slob
letters flying across the screen
okay were ready
reads as she types mike
i hate this downsizing shit as much as you do
but i know this cant become as a complete surprise
through the window the wedding party barbecue has extended into night
lanterns music lots more food lots more drinks
in the distance on the sand michael is slowdancing with kimmy
some where nearby the soft clicking of keys
we pull back to see
a small clubby room
books leather polished woods
only two people here
walter looking on stony faced as a determined julianne grimly struggles to find what shes looking for in michaels laptop
she stops typing
looks at the text on the screen
her eyes sharpen as she reads what walter cant see
its an oscar performance for our desperate girl
she turns the screen around
i hate this downsizing
all the air comes out of him
softly and kimmy doesnt know
she shakes her head
signs ill tell her ive reconsidered
she nods gravely
he looks in her eyes
youre a smart girl jules
she forces up a fleeting smile of gratitude
but walter isnt smiling at all
wish my daughter
bad your guts
the hot saloon in chinatown
upscale downscale jammed michael and kimmy at a small table in a far corner
close on them
sure youre okay
she looks really scared
turns her drink in her hand
looking down at it
its not just a gag huh
no its uh
a real big favor
he takes her hand tenderly
i wish youd just
come out with it
i mean why are we waiting for jules
she smiles up at him
the best she can
she loves him so much and she is sick with worry
whats good of having a big sister if she
gestures with her eyes
because her big sister has just entered
julianne wears a long sleek sarong slightly see through
her hair is bound up with silver pins
as she moves through the room toward us we can see that for once her make up is flawless understated
when she arrives at the table
michael is beaming admiringly
he stands up
softly wow and wow
you have a date after this
never can tell
he holds her chair
she exchanges an intimate smile with the anxious kim
you make me think of that song we used to
and he starts humming
the song is the way you look tonight
when im awfully low
he looks from julianne to his bride
kims eyes flick to julianne who nods supportively
the kid takes a breath
its really my father
who needs the favor
his face sort of comes to a stop
nothing she can read yet
he nods yeah
hes reorganizing some of the divisions of the company
his eyes flick to julianne
she looks down
quiet he never mentioned that
neither did y
blurting and public relations is a big problem area for him
she can see it now
in his eyes
she just cant tell how bad
he needs someone incredible someone really close who he can trust
like family huh
she is terrified
it would only be maybe six months
or three or four
it would mean so much to him
straightens her spine
and to m
sharp to julianne and you knew about this
against the noise of this place
i think you ought to listen to her michael
this is her life too
just the thing
to bring that anger near the surface
he turns to kim
well which is it
she doesnt like that
you gonna tell me daddy thought this one up
all of a sudden im the only jerk alive who can help him deal with the press
a deer in headlights
why dont you start being honest for one fucking sec
near tears i am honest
all of a sudden im supposed to drop out of school forget my family forget my career forget all the plans i had for my life
well forgive me for screwing up your plans
he cant even believe hes hearing this
im sure glad im hearing all this now before its too late
what is that sup
and what am i supposed to do with my life huh
i am years old
i work in a low paying low status zero respect job which unfortunately i happen to fucking love
a little bullshit about daddys needs and presto im a lap dog in high society
softly michael it sounds like a wonderful opportun
whips around does it really
how come you never took some sell out establishment job
you had plenty of chances
glares in her eyes
ill tell you why
because that isnt you
and it isnt me either
were the same person
back to kim
what a sweet little picture
mommy and daddy arent losing a daughter theyre gaining a eunuch
well if thats the way you f
damn straight its how i feel
whats their wedding gift a little gold collar that says mikey poo
or do i have to change my name to binky
shes crying now
real tears on her face
the big equalizer
you wait till two days before the wedding to drop this on me and im just supposed to roll over and drool
she is sobbing now
she cant help herself
which makes him totally crazy
he jumps up
im an insensitive chauvinist asshole and youre well rid of m
a wrenching cry from her heart
it stops him cold
and before juliannes astonished eyes kimmy reaches out a trembling hand
michael you are so
choking back the sobs
and i am so very wrong
for different reasons
we cant go down two roads
and still be together
her fingers stretch beckoning
ignores her we settled this
and i reneged
that wasnt fair
please please take my hand
you have to forgive me and forget this ever happened
people are watching staring
these two see only each other
or ill die
a frozen forever moment
he steps to her
lifts her up in his arms
into the deepest most heartfelt kiss
and as she clings to him people begins to applaud and whistle and laugh
in her pretty dress
closes her eyes
julianne in her nightshirt her back to us sobbing into her cellular as she paces the room
see thats what i never counted on
i never heard of a brilliant moron before
we close as she whips around startling us with her grotesque day glo purple face mask
the green was better
i mean the little twerp losing it
we know the drill
clutching the phone
michael and i are the same person
self absorbed and imperfect and vaguely loveable
we deserve each other
tears are flowing
which over this mask is not a pretty sight
im out of hope im out of sneaky ideas im at the end of my rapidly fraying hysterical little rope
she trips over an open suitcase and disappears from frame
the thud is slightly alarming
god i hate this hotel
on nothing is particular
and i hate talking to your machine
rear view of julianne asleep on the floor sunlight streaming in
a soft knocking on a door somewhere nearby
she barely stirs
the knock becomes a strong rapping and she fights for conscious ness
her back still to us she
rises stumbles to the door which is now pulsing with an insistent pounding and throws it open as we snap to
close on juliannes face still encased in a now decomposing purple mask her eyes springing wide she screams in shock and we snap back to
digger watching impassively at the high strung shriek
in the silence that follows
you stole my line
he touches his face and she realizes
starts clawing at the overripe mask but he grabs her wrists
we dont want your face coming off with it
since when do you say ch
when im talking to children
she looks in his eyes
realizing at last
you flew all the way h
im on the noon back
we have this thing with georges family in the hamptons
soft youre butting in
he still holds her wrists
she brings one of his hands to her lips
kisses his knuckles
softer i really resent this
julianne seated at the sink staring into the mirror as digger gently applies soup cloth and water to easing away the mask
a paleontologist restoring a bronze age artifact
by the side of the half filled sink rests her plugged in curling iron
what i mean when i say annoyingly perfect is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection
it is vulnerable and endearing
and that is annoying as shit
you like her
if i didnt have to hate her id adore her
she looks up at him and winces as the movement makes him scrape her face
last night she was crying these big real tears when she thought shed lost him
it was like there was a knife in her heart
looking in his eyes
needs him to hear
and i put it there
i hated myself i grieved for her i couldnt enjoy one second of it
and then when it didnt work
can you believe this
i was devastated
softly go figure you
because i realized
when i see him say i do that knife will be in my heart
and it will be there every
she holds his wrists now
to stop him
to plead for understanding
every time i think of him forever which could be a lot
she almost choked on that last part
so she composes herself
you watch a guy caress his girlfriends butt
you see an old spice commercial
sentimental moments are everywhere when youre in the right frame of mind
she swallows hard
fights for a grip on her determination
there are nights in the next years
youve been working on this huh
and having done the right thing will only really be comforting oh maybe five six times
she sets her jaw
this is my whole lifes happiness
i have to be ruthless
quietly and you believe that
his eyes are gentle and merciless at once
no way she gets off this hook
he was in love with me every day for nine years
i can make him happier than she can
its not his happiness youre feeling guilty about
proudly i dont know the meaning of the word guilt
i am breaking her heart in the short run but doing her a gigantic favor
she would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus
the man you love
the feminist warrior will rise up in this kid and shell be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife selecting from a short list of body parts
someday shell thank you
lets not get carried away
and the defenses drain from her clay ravaged features
the real julianne is glimpsed
id settle for
someday ill forgive myself
for doing this terrible thing
her eyes tear up
which by the way i cant figure out how to do
as the tears fall he wipes at them discovering
youre supposed to take your make up off before you apply the m
guess what i brushed my teeth with last night
he thinks about this
following her eyes to the toiletries kit he browses for a moment
try less appropriate
that was thursday
he stops on that note
i cant even say it
the first word is preparation
then comes a letter of the alphabet perilously close to g
she reaches to test her curling iron burns her finger shit
knocking the appliance into the half filled sink
she lunges for it and a terrified digger grasps her arm
considering the circumstances im not wholly against suicide
just not by electrocution in front of me
ive got this noon flight
he reaches to pull the plug from the wall and now she lunges to grab his arm slipping her face falling forward stopping an inch above the sink
how do you know you can touch that plug
are you a licensed contractor
what do you suggest
she looks from the plug down the cord to the submerged curling iron
maybe they just seal off this room
they have others
hes staring at her
sweet but intense
i didnt mean about that
if i hear the words tell the truth or any paraphrase thereof i dive into the sink and pull you with me
looking at her
looking at her
lets go meet michael
ill wait downstairs
julianne has cleaned up pretty good
she sits with digger on a fashion fabric sofa
they are side by side studying something with equal concentration
and slight concern
i suppose its too late to start over
its too late to start over
pull back to reveal michael in his wedding tux submitting to a final fitting from a stylish fitter
you guys are heartless my bride picked this out
like i said dazzling
is she going to dress you every day
michael smiles over
digger smiles back
they live each other
yeah its in the contract
softly well then ill take it up with her
michael motions okay cmon over
digger rises goes to michael the fitter steps back as digger shows him
the cut here here
fingers lightly traveling over the lapel the side stitching the cloth straight down the spine
trouser width this is all classic
which means safe something id wear
i should look different
you should look like you dressed yourself
michaels grin is back
playful and friendly
and im supposed to respect your fashion tips because youre what a new yorker
quiet smile something like that
julianne loves that the boy are getting on
means this long trip
pretty nice of you to come
well im close to her
i wanted to meet the one that got away
said so naturally
that embarrasses michael who looks down his smile suddenly awkward
im just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective
steals a glance at julianne
she rolls her eyes
what a goofball my outrageous friend
to digger stay huh
i honestly wish i could
ill call georges parents
tell them i need a best man who actually looks after me
julianne comes over
softly theyd say thats my job
she runs her hands over his jacket smoothing it everywhere
with tenderness that approaches transparency
glances back at digger
ill take it home from here
pinches michaels ear
looks in his eyes
she looks down
michaels nails are unclipped with layers of impacted dirt
she touches his fingertips a little more softly than she may have intended
everyone looks down
she zips michael up
to digger you dont miss much
part of being a new yorker
cutting edge salon
loud pulsing music
digger and michael in adjacent chairs heads back each smoking impressive cigars as their hair is styled
diggers stylist is a hot trashy female
michaels is a tall flamboyant male in a day glo vest
each man has one hand soaking the other being worked on by a manicurist so julianne goes from one to the other removing their cigars so they can exhale
a seraglio feel to the way she does this
now shes arguing with michaels stork like stylist
we cant hear over the music but she keeps tugging on michaels hair pretty passionate about her point of view
suddenly she grabs the scissors to do it herself and michael
bolts out of the chair
skycaps guests of impatient travelers a bus offloading forty japanese tourists
a taxi cuts off a van to reach the curb
opening the door for digger and julianne
digger says something michael gives him a strong hug
julianne raises one finger to michael back in a second
leads digger off by the hand
close on them now
alone in the throng
digger just stares at her
those maddening judgemental eyes
youre going to say it arent you
tell him you love him
with all your heart
im taking my next book to viking
tell him youve loved him for nine years but you were afraid to realize it
im moving this book to viking
tell him youre afraid of love
afraid of needing
to belong to someone
he touches her hair
we all do beautiful
im sorry about that
staring in her eyes
even julianne has run out of words
tell him you know this is the worst dumbest cruelest moment to do this to him
but there it is and he has to choose
and what will he do
digger isnt smiling
his voice low beneath the crowd
hell choose kim
youll stand by her at her wedding
youll kiss him good bye
and youll go home
he holds up one finger
almost touching her nose
this is what youve come to do
now do it
she looks frightened and moved all at the same time
she kisses him on the lips
and walks away
he watches her go through the crowd
take michaels hand
lead him back toward the taxi
the skyline of chicago moves past us
the nbc tower cityfront center
big weddings are so strange
you keep saying that
up ahead the wrigley building draws closer
kim has all this stuff to do i hardly see her
well youve got the rest of your lives
they lean on the rail of a cruise boat easing down the chicago river
getting your bed made
they smile at each other
seem so comfortable together
you miss her huh
ive got you
that you have
staring in her eyes
dont you throw up on boat
if you like
and she lurches over the railing emitting a barrage of incredibly disgusting sounds her feet flailing in mid air
he laughs as he pulls her back down to the deck
of course it was all a joke
he brushes back her hair
ive been thinking a lot the last couple days
about us actually
casual have you
theres a lot of memories to choose from
its more than that
that tightens her throat pretty good
when she tries to speak out comes a dry croak that makes him laugh again
softer this time
i mean its embarrassing to say it this way but
her eyes widen in a burlesque of anticipation
so he smiles
she knows how to put him at ease
youve sort of been
yknow the woman in my life
straight back youve been the man in mine
passing under the michigan avenue bridge
no one knows quite what to say
and i was thinking this could be our last time
except for the hot affairs well have twice a year
except for that
shes smiling so easily
who would guess her stomach is double knotted
i can hardly wait for your wedding
she watches his surprise
boy i never thought id hear you say that
can i come
she holds herself together
real soft with
i couldnt have it without you
hes glad to hear that
its normal to have
second thoughts huh
to be scared
is this a change of direction
or is it the direction shes been praying for
i wouldnt know
i never had that many first thoughts
i mean you commit to a wedding
and then it seems like
momentum you know
you forget you
you and i
i mean in all our relationships with other people
we didnt use the word love a lot did we
when you love someone
you say it you say it out loud
or the moment
passes you by yeah
shes a smart girl
off in distance the centennial fountain shoots an eight foot jet of water across the river
for michael and julianne it goes unnoticed
we dont have a song
kimmy and i
we dont have a song
is that a bad sign
all julianne can do is shrug
sings softly someday when im awfully low
and the world is cold
she doesnt want to cry
so she puts all the strength she has into fighting it back
sings i will feel a glow just thinking of you
and the way you look
smiles that sweet boyish smile
dance card filled
i have it on powerbook these days
he holds up his arms
and she moves into them
he begins to dance with her turning so slowly
and yes people are watching
sings in her ear with each word your tenderness grows tearing my fears apart
she holds him closer
bites her lip
sings and that laugh that wrinkles your nose touches my foolish heart
he looks at her
shes still in his arms
where did we first hear th
straight back the night we met
right to his eyes
the night we fell in love
he doesnt know what to do with that
so we heard it
like right that
we danced to it
just like this
just like this
a long beat
and he has to say
i wont lose you will i
her eyes close
utterly lost in his
because i wont let you
julianne in crisp chalk stripe trousers and a buttoned up dress shirt
her coat slung over her shoulder she wanders through the saturday deserted office space
desks cubicles monitors silent
a row of executive offices standing empty waiting for the custodian
turning a corner we hear
life at the end of the hallway
a grand conference room with a glass wall
walter in shirtsleeves running a strategy meeting for five
deidre his personal secretary clicking every word into her laptop at warp speed
walter sees julianne through the glass
a comic take of pleased surprise
he comes out to greet her
i thought michael was picking me up
i told him get the important stuff kims ring
ill collect the inconsequentials
they smile at each other
kim said when he turned down the job there was no friction
julianne thinks back
he smiles at her line reading
but his mind is always probing
i havent caused
a problem have i
her bright grin
his eyes linger on it
well youre a little early
i need to make some calls
could i use
julianne enters the spacious corner office high above the city
closes the door quietly behind her
so anxious she is practically hyperventilating
she goes slowly to the vacant cherrywood desk
its computer and monitor standing silent
she is stalking it like a deadly animal
she is there
talking to herself her own desperate support network
softly you can do this
sacred filled with doubt and conflict
her hands clutch at each other
then one flicks out
and the computer goes on
the screen glows
waits for her
her mouth is sand her stomach water
she pulls the paper from her pocket
looks at it
looks to the monitor
mumbling to herself e mail address
to ben isaacson senior editor sports illustrated from
her heart is thumping
see you can do it
doesnt look easy
licks her lips
you do it fast its over
like it never happened
and recites as she types
i need a favor
here we go
this is it
my daughters every happiness
and my wifes
and least of all my own are in your hands
knowing you value our friendship and the
cooperative relationship between our companies
i am hopeful of your help
it has to be
i have offered mike oneal my new son in law a great opportunity in my company
this would also enable my daughter to settle in chicago near us and pursue her dreams and plans
to his own detriment as well as ours michael will not accept our offer
while he works for you
she stands up
stares at the screen
still standing types
my daughter joins me in this plea for your cooperation and discretion
is there a sound
outside the door
she hovers over the escape key
for your understanding
she hits a key
the screen goes blank
the computer asks
do you wish to send
she tells the computer
are you crazy
get him fired
the computer asks hold for later
and she types yes
just till tonight when i bring him back
to look for
she glances to her huge bag
rummages through pulling out a manila folder
lays it by the blank computer
fans out a few pages in a natural disorderly way
takes a step back
struck to her gut
but when she has done
walter alone with deidre now signing a stack of documents as she efficiently places one after another before him
when he glances up he sees julianne wandering the halls
stands tells his secretary
going through stack off to rehearsal
send out this and this not this this and
slips on his coat
and by the way
im holding four or five e mails i wrote over lunch
on his way through the door
send em out
julianne and walter enter the rear of a striking gothic chapel pastel light slanting in through stained glass windows
we now see the full effect of her outfit a mans style chalk stripe suit tailored to fit her body set off by a bold silk tie
she hangs back while walter proceeds down the vaulted nave toward
michael kimmy isabelle and joe who stand casually joking by the altar
scattered around are assorted groomsmen ushers an obvious flowergirl
coming toward us up the aisle
the minister early s lean and quite attractive
mandy is hanging on his arm pressing her body against him as they walk murmuring urgent murmurs close to his ear
hes a really good sport and really uncomfortable
sammy is walking backwards right in front of them drops her bag and bends to retrieve it as if oblivious to major cleavage on immediate display
julianne is so lost in her own anxiety she doesnt even notice until
reverend dyer this is kimberlys somewhat butch maid of honor
julianne potter prominent new york drag queen
today the girls voices are charmingly musically southern with none of the extreme accents we heard at the shower
the minister extends his hand
billy dyer julianne
and i love the suit
she shakes his hand smiles graciously but her eyes flick to michael now approaching up the aisle
the girls lead the minister away
looks her up and down
softly takes me back
one that glows a little
you sang the song
least i could do was wear the outfit
except now youre better looking
as she loses herself in his eyes
i got the ring
he pulls the box from his pocket
somewhere an organ sounds
and as he is about to hand her the box
sing swi i ng low ow ow
wee ee eet char i ot
such exquisite two part harmony michael stops to watch
sing comin to car ryyy me ho o o me
it is amazing
soulful vengeful sluts
he is enthralled
julianne simply impatient
she wants his attention
no accents today
yeah kim told me they were giving you their dueling scarlets act
actually theyre sophomores at juilliard
she takes the box from his hand
opens it as the singing continues throughout
the ring is delicate hammered gold
one of a kind
will she like it
shes staring at the ring
my groom person
your family needs you
his masters voice
he gives julianne a smile
shes left with the box
gazes at the ring
lifts it out
singing well i look over yon der and what did i see ee ee
slips it on her left hand
singing comin too car ryyy
me ho o ome
turns it on her finger
so many emotions
singing it was a hand
of a a angels
coming for me e ee
tries to pull it off
singing comin for to carry me home
it wont come
not even close
close on a bowl filled with squares of butter
hear the butt of conversation from a rowdy friendly joint
juliannes right hand reaches to the bowl fingers trace the rim innocently then
slide the bowl into juliannes lap beneath the table
her right hand massages all the butter into a gooey revolving mess
we can pick out familiar voices now family in distance the twins closer
as hidden from view julianne brings
her left hand from her pocket
the ring is still there
the finger already red and swollen from pacicky efforts to pull it off
and as applause surrounds us julianne
plunges her ring finger into the morass of grease frantically tearing at the ring butter splurging on her pants everywhere as we pull back to see
the long table covered with butcher paper the family at the far end the twins down here with us a mug of beer for each place as team of waiters
with heaping platters of crabs which they
fling across the butcher paper as applause continues from everyone but julianne who still struggles secretly
as the waiters set huge wooden mallets in front of each guest joe oneal rises pounds the table with his mallet for attention
like to welcome everbody to our little rehearsal supper
he coughs unaccustomed to public speaking
walter and isabelle clap and call out support
so joe lifts his mallet
okay everyone stand up
and everyone does
with one exception
she jams her left hand in her coat pocket smears her right palm sort of clean on the underside of the table grabs her mallet and jumps up
to the bride uh goes the honor
of cracking the first crab
everyone applauses by banging their mallets
joe raises his high
but first a toast
and everybody snatches up their beers with their left hands as julianne drops her mallet with a horrific crash grabbing her beer looking up to
on the spot im right handed
a hugely embarrassing half second
bailed out by
to our host my cuddly papa joe
who taught me to play blue hawaii
on my nose
with a look at julianne kim sets down her mallet gently and performs a nasal hum of the tropical standard strikingly her nostril repeatedly for vibrato
it is charming and everybody watches
close on an actual living if geriatric lion
he blinks from his cage bored as hell
hear the surrounding noise chatter loud sinatra music of a very large party
pull back to see
and overdecorated ballroom in dim and dramatic lighting dripping with the trappings of ancient rome
the mingling guests are the neatly one hundred females of the wedding party most of them older women
they are served by wandering well built athletes in roman togas or gladiator costumes
julianne still in her suit hiding by a table piled with a carload of grapes
her left hand still buried in her pocket
the eyes of a hunted animal
she jumps a foot both hands flying up left one awkwardly slamming back into its pocket
the girls have snuck up behind her
they have changed into hot gowns that are really only wide ribbons wrapped around their bodies
i know why youre scared of our party
its too hip
sinatra singing stranger in the night
hugely muscled half naked black and white studs serving enchanted blue haired ladies
kimberly wanted to tickle the grandmas so we figured give em a cheap thrill
walter supplied the decorative touches
points out the jokes nose tackle from the bears
power forward from the bulls
defenseman from the black hawks
my personal favorite the designated hitter
im partial to the tight end
this is usda prime largely available beef
with no notice able competition present company excepted
now they stare at her
with identical really odd smiles
and yet here you are
all celibate and reclusive
with those big dark haunted eyes
as if you were harborin some
well im worried about something
their expressions are deliciously identically expectant
i left this really important file in walters office
i have to send my editor some
on territorial sales
to close my book deal
so kim gave me the key
and michaels on his way to drive me down to wal
we thought it was the ring
the one you better get the fuck off your third finger left hand
that was a
reflex to see if it would
helpful look good on kimberly
and then it didnt want to come off
maybe its happy there
oh the way out of the crab house
we asked michael if we could see the ring
he said you told him
itd be safer with you
an so it is
julianne for once is speechless
to our amazement the girls wear identical smiles of kindness and support
shut up sugar hes on his way
lets get to work
huge gleaming chaotic kitchen
cooks waiters working at top speed
the three women race in look around frantically half the guys stop to ogle the twins
and industrial sized jar of peanut butter
juliannes hand plunges in halfway to the rolled up sleeve at her elbow
smooches it around real good
pull back to reveal
she is surrounded by the twins and six guys all shouting conflicting instructions
julianne flings off the excess slop
tugs for all shes worth
it wont budge
a sous chef wipes her hand with a towel a janitor crashes a tool kit onto the counter
throws it open pulls out
a spray can of wd
instantly her hand is black
the guy tugs
he cant believe it
its mental lady you aint trying
sammy is rummaging through her handbag pulling out
there is nothing so tight this cant help it
a tube of jelly
the letter k y
julianne just gives her a look
mandy pushes through with a butchers cleaver
i saw this on hard copy
people cut off body parts and the hospital sew em back o
the look has turned toward her
cold i saw the show
well maybe it works on fingers too
the little girl in the doorway
everything gets real quiet
mandy takes charge
she rolls down juliannes left sleeve rips the hem out of the cuff so that it flaps down over her hand covering the ring
sammy wipes the black stuff from juliannes fingers
dont worry baby
you could pick your nose with that finger and michael would never notice
hes a man
the twins lead her off
were on their backs for
personally i think mr
michaels marrying the wrong girl
youre much more his type
view through a heavy glass door of the empty dimly lit lobby
pull back to see julianne just as she
kicks the shit out of the glass
almost breaks her foot
i cant believe this
pull back farther to see michael still trying keys from a large key ring in the heavy lock
sign over the door says wallace enterprises
traffic hustles by oblivious to her suffering
its no big deal she just gave you the wrong keys thats s
and she slams her whole body against the glass making it rattle ominously
she looks around wildly hysterical
what is the big deal about getting this file tonight
a good question
she needs a good answer
i promised digger id e mail him those figures
from his face that wasnt it
they are very important figures
hes just staring at her
im up against a deadline
im getting married tomorrow
thats my point
he really doesnt get it
i mean tomorrow
well all be busy with more important things
tonights my last chance
i forgot how cute you look
when you get impossible
right in front of walters
if memory serves
we could use
his computer to
just e mail those suckers right ou
tomorrow is sunday
nobodys doing business
crack of dawn monday walterll take you up there
her eyes fill with tears
he is mystified
softly give it up kid
touches her hair
you cant win em all
and slowly he takes her hand
leads her way
she takes one backward glance at the locked door
her last dream dies
michael and a disconsolate julianne board the elevator
he presses she pushes
michael carries a handful of messages slips and an envelope
as the car starts up she folds her arms across her chest at the edge of tears
he doesnt know what to do
gently listen up huh
even if you blow this deal how big could it be
voice nearly cracking youre right
easy come easy go
hes really concerned cant bear to see her so upset
she wont look at him
she wants to die
the bell rings the doors open to her floor
she just walks out
and he follows
they stand now she with her arms crossed lip trembling
she cant believe how close she is to losing it
this thing means that much to y
it means a lot
ill call the house walters probably not even asleep
her mouth drops
she cant believe this
ill drive you out there well get the key well go back to the office
she throws her arms around his hugging him so hard so close
he laughs she is so weird
she pulls back beaming glowing
come on well call from your room
she claps his hand
as they head down the hall
if i fall asleep on the altar tomorrow
hes trying to flip through the message slips in his free hand
you better be there to
funny these are all from ben
shes at her door turning the key
he looks at the envelope
the fax is from ben too
man its my wedding and my boss cant leave me alone
entering her room maybe its congratulations
he follows her in opening the envelope
and his face suddenly
turning to him michael
i cant believe im doing this to you on the night before your wedding
but i think you need and deserve to know
and he looks up to her
what youre marrying into
he hands it toward her
she takes it hesitantly and he walks past
toward the phone
reading i received the following e mail this afternoon
ben i need a favor
my daughters every happiness
her eyes bug out of her head
we can hear him dialing the phone
she keeps reading its all there
how did this happen
i need to talk to kim
reading mike the funny thing is hes offering you a gig youd be stupid to turn down
im just tired
please put her on
reading maybe you should take the job
and dump the girl
and when she turns
could you give me a minute
he looks more sick than angry
as if the heart has just been cut out of him
she doesnt know what to say or do so she just stands staring dumbly
she nods stumbles out of her room closing the door behind her
now shes in the empty corridor clutching her big jumbled bag sinking down to sit on the carpet her back against the door
she doesnt look elated
she seems frightened distraught and most of all confused
because she cant understand why
she digs absently through her bag
box of matches
she lights up
somehow she seems near tears and laughs bitterly at that
shakes her head at how fucked up she finds herself
squeaking wheels approach but she is too lost to hear them
miss are you locked out or something
she looks up
a small wiry man of nearly in a slightly faded but neatly kept uniform
on his cart a ton of bags
no i just stepped out because
its a non smoking room
and inhales deeply
leans back against the door to look up at him more comfortably
politely well its non smoking floor too
maybe you could go to the
seriously why dont you have me arrested
that wasnt sarcastic
he doesnt know what to say
i mean that
arrested convicted put in solitary
see im a dangerous criminal person
i do bad things to honest people
this see this smoking
tip of the iceberg
waves her hand
make a citizens arrest i wont struggle
itll be like getting al capone on tax evasion
now she seems angry
but not at him
her eyes fill with tears
can i help you miss
she squints at his nameplate
do you smoke richard
yes maam i do but its
a non smoking floor yeah
well you know what
and she takes the cigarette from her lips
turns it around holds it out to him
he doesnt move
he reaches down takes the cigarette from her hand
staring in her eyes he takes a deep drag
savors an expert nostril inhale of his exhaled smoke
hands the cigarette back to her
my grandmother always said this too shall pass
wipes at her eyes
finds a smile
if you werent on duty id buy you a drink
he just nods
he waves back pushes his cart down the hall
as she watches him go the door behind her suddenly opens and she
falls through it flat on her back at michaels feet
staring up at him seeing that he looks as bad as she feels she takes raw deep drag
softly its over
and crouches down
close beside her
the cigarette drops from her hand unnoticed on the carpet
so he lifts it crushes it on the heel of his shoe
i want you to quit this shit itll kill you
she just nods obediently
okay i will
she denied it
said i was crazy and paranoid
a bad combination
he tries to smile
its really hard
theres this big brunch tomorrow morning
at her place
he lets the air out
so he wont cry
she said how can i call everything off what do i tell everybody
shakes his head
can you imagine that
no its for the best it really is
we were so wrong for each other
maybe tomorrow youll feel dif
the job thing would have broken us up eventually anyway
she couldnt have lived with it
i know that now
maybe that part is right
maybe it would have ended anyway
maybe she can pretend shes not a monster
and shes right im crazy to fall for someone
i hardly knew
looks deep in her eyes
hes so glad shes there
you still got that ring
she holds up her left hand the flapping sleeve falls away
the ring is on a finger that is swollen and raw
i tried it on
but it wont come off
he smiles at that
a sad smile of friendship
then takes her finger gently
into his mouth
it is something like a kiss
and when he removes her moistened finger
he pulls the ring off
nothing to it
its mental you know
he doesnt understand that
should we take a walk
or maybe some food sent up or something
i just want to be alone
is that okay
she nods sure
he kisses her cheek
maybe ill go back to new york
hang with you for awhile huh
she nods again
whatever you say
he steps into the open doorway
or well go somewhere
if you have the time
if san antonio sweeps sacramento
they smiles at each other
ive never been to texas
the look holds
just above a whisper
thanks for coming to my wedding
and then hes gone
julianne brushing out her hair in the bathroom mirror eyeing her image with evident dissatisfaction as she listens to the receiver digger and george are with family in the hamptons
until monday morning
brevity is even more in order than usual
her eyes find the pack of cigarettes
next to her toiletries kit
softly i won
her fingers touch the pack
as if an object of significance
takes it up
i didnt do things quite your way
i got it down
cradling the phone against her shoulder she carefully tears the top of the pack completely open
and forty years and nine grand children later when i sit with michael on some rustic porch slogging through our sweet swamp of nostalgic memories
reaches the pack toward the toilet
no one is going to sweet the details
turns it upside down emptying a dozen cigarettes into the john
of one weekend in chicago
drops the lid with a clatter
hits the flush
talk about celebration
she lifts a tube from her toiletries kit
stares at it real close
im gonna brush my teeth with actual toothpaste
turns it over reads all the writing
i guess im too exhausted to feel the elation i so richly undeserve
squeezes some paste onto her brush
so im gonna hold calls at the desk
while i get my
around her mouthful god it is toothpaste they should sell this stuff commercially
anyway a girl does need her
squints at her image
laughs spewing a little foam
well were a bit past worrying about beauty sleep
lets just settle for not frightening small animals
tells diggers machine
anyway i couldnt have done it without you
even though i did if you follow that
wipes her mouth
the eyes a little dreamy
three words happily
well you know
julianne sprawled all over the bed mouth open like a carp sleeping mask against the daylight
a sudden rapping at the door and she
sits bolt upright
utterly disoriented until she pulls off the mask
stumbles out of bed walking toward the firm knocking when
a message slip slides beneath her door
she lifts it barely conscious
this wakes her up
to the slip youre going where
julianne climbs from her taxi
only slightly in awe she sets off past the reflecting pool which fronts a mansion of graceful stone and timber
its a hike today because the circular drives is clogged deep with bentleys mercedes and waiting limos vying for space with a score of delivery vehicles of all kinds maintenance
trucks catering and florist and food vans
julianne escorted into an enormous room where brunch is in progress for more than a hundred
she looks from the vaulted ceilings to the frescoed walls the inlaid floors the massive pipe organ above the stone staircase the oil portraits of scottish ancestors and their favorite
isabelle has risen from the main table and comes to her
julianne is in the twilight zone
what are these people laughing about
do they still think theres a wedding
were so glad you slept in
takes her arm graciously
this woman would make anne bancroft look coarse
as they walk
now you have a choice
the idea is bride and groom shouldnt see each other on the magic day
julianne looking all around
magic day it seems to be
where the bell is a bride or a groom
so michael stays put in the garden
kimmy stays in here
there she is obscured by a cluster of the appropriately fawning
she has the same hunted eyes and false slightly manic smile julianne wore yesterday
this at least makes sense
and the guests go back and forth
where will you start
close on julianne
watching the brave frightened bride
she looks tense
i would never have guessed
a steward leads julianne to the edge of an expansive rose garden altogether elegant and comfortable with its long white picnic tables where nearly a hundred guests casually dine served
by rolling carts
there at the head table michael staring at us
he looks like a poor attempt to cover a hard night
she locks onto his eyes
what the hell is going on
he looks helpless miserable
she gestures with her head follow me
bronze abstract pieces some quite large face a huge set of childrens swings regulation playground size
julianne sits in one moving slightly back and forth
trying to hold on to her temper and her sanity
in the distance trucks are winding their way to and from the pond where crews are setting up tents lights heaters for tonight
the circus has come to town
when she looks back
before he can draw a breath
i had the craziest dream last night
walter and kimmy had asked your boss to
look i came down here to face everybody
i didnt want to slink away like some coward
but the scotch salmon was so fucking good you decided to stay for brunch
she hasnt told anybody what am i supposed to do
get married apparently
she comes off the swing pushes him back two feet
what the hell are you thinking of the goddamn wedding is six he swallows hard
this is her family and her fault
and your point
ten years old well
how come she didnt
he just blinks
this is a serious matter
she pokes his chest punctuating
ill be right back
a modern take on the medieval castle kitchen towering ceilings dark wood copper pots hanging a series of walk in coolers and freezers
the place is a madhouse of activity as prep cooks slice chop sort every kind of food imaginable and delivery teams bring more
the girls walk through
alone together in the eye of the hurricane
kim choked with excess sentiment
look at all this beautiful food so lovingly prepared
theyll eat it anyway you ever been to a walk
kimmys lip trembles
this is not how she thought of her wedding
the din is so horrific kimmy leads them into a walk in meat locker
even here two butchers are dressing eastern fresh corn fed carcasses
you guys want to give us a minute
the men blink at each other
wed like to be alone with our pork
on that basis
kimmy sits on a stack of packaged frozen fowl parts
stares up with big sweet wet eyes
hows he doing
julianne cannot believe this
the jerk whos running your life
this must be
very very hard on him
what with the psychosis and all yeah
when are you gonna come clean with your folks
dont you see
if youre waiting for do you take this man
thats considered poor form
that this is all my fault
stops julianne cold
whatever delusions i drove him to there is truth at the heart of it
i want him to work for my father
i want to stay in school
i want a life of my own
harder and harder for julianne to push
her mouth is dry
yeah well lots of couples are imcompat
i love him
fragile and strong at once
tell him its my fault and that i love him
a long beat
ill be right back
the court has become a giant holding pen for tonights balloons
there are maybe a billion in assorted colors already blowing in all directions under clear plastic sheeting which has ben spread across the top of the courts chain link fence
michael stands outside the court clutching the chain link like a prisoner as julianne comes through the gate
from somewhere we hear high squeaky alien voice like sounds
how is she
julianne absorbs this
as the bizarre sounds continue she whirls around
we now see three stoner college guys who have been filling the endless array of balloons from helium tanks at center court
clearly theyve been inhaling their working materials
minnie mouse a nazi salute
when she turns back
i asked you
she admits its her fault
he absorbs that
do you think she still loves me
we watch the struggle inside her
her voice drops
sure she does
shes crazy about you
now tears stand in both their eyes
the stoners are doing their alvin and the chipmuks impersonation festival in the b
singing in castrato harmony
but our two dont notice
i keep asking how can i explain what happened
and i keep getting that same answer all night long
and it doesnt matter
i drove her to it because i want things my way
and even if she did something tricky and unfair
she was blinded by love okay
for obvious reasons
does that make it right
love doesnt have to be right
it just has to be love
the stoner are now helium crooning bridge over troubled waters
actually theyre getting better
shes giving up half her life for me and im bitching because it hurts her
singing sail on silver girl sail on by
shes a saint
and im a worthless ingrate
singing your time has come to shine all your dreams are on their way
ill marry her at six oclock if shell still have me
the stoners blend on the high note
its pretty moving
ill be right back
pan along a gigantic serpentine stack of wedding presents
nearly twelve feet high the pile curves along the balcony high above the diners in the great room extending al the way to
an organ loft
alone above the noise of the party julianne and kimmy have just reached the top of the staircase
trapped between ten tons of lavish gifts and the keyboard of the mammoth organ
dwarfed by their surroundings kimmy draws the hardest breath of her life
what did he say
juliannes eyes move over the young girls face
kimmy yelps in her ecstasy flinging herself against julianne and they go down full length across the organs pedals blasting the room with a monster chord of china rattling volume
and horrifying disharmony
as grown men and women scream in spontaneous terror below kimmy begins to
and kiss and hug her new sister
and holds her tight
julianne and michael walk the gravel path beside a breathtaking pond ringed with willows that dig heavy branches to the waters surface
he is relieved reflective
head down he never notices that she is
too petrified even to hyperventilate were lucky shes breathing at all
we watch her life unraveling before her glassy eyes
never looks up thank god you were here
mumbles to herself oh yeah
i was so confused so conflicted so
well it happens
they pass an expanse of lawn which has become the event parking area
family vehicles delivery trucks service vans
everything that couldnt fit on the circular front driveway
i might have thrown away
searching for the right words
your one chance for true happiness
you never want to do that see thats always a
as they say in the sport biz
theres a vague stepford wife quality to her voice
he hears that now and looks at her
maybe he cant tell shes frightened
but he can tell shes something
softly are you okay
she stops walking
she cant look at him so she looks around
across the lawn crews are moving equipment into the brightly colored tents unfolding and setting up stacks of tables and chairs raising the poles between which all those balloons will
at the center of it all
a huge topiary white sox batter just completing a murderous swing
hes maybe fifteen feet tall
she points to it
the big hurt huh
walter likes the past
and he likes the little guys
so julianne nods
because she does too
squints up at michael
got a minute
he nods you bet
worried for her
what is this
she looks in another direction and we now see that we have nearly reached
a stage thats been set up for the band
chairs music stands sound equipment
a gleaming dance floor already in place over the lawn
next to it a shimmering white gazebo
like the centerpiece of a wedding cake
why is the dance floor by the gazebo
she takes his hand
they walk toward it
she thought it would be such a romantic place
for our wedding dance
looking down at her
up the white steps now
the gazebo floor has been covered with hardwood
the perfect place
for a wedding dance
he almost runs into her
she is staring up at him so strangely their bodies only inches apart
he is caught transfixed by the intensity in her eyes
i have to say this quick okay or ill have this massive coronary and youll never have to hear it
which you need to
does that make any sense at all
the coronary part does
we can feel her heart beating from here
jules whats wrong
this is the dumbest thing i will ever do
so dumb in fact that i cant
i dont think
and then she does
she puts her hands flat on his chest
looks in his eyes
michael i love you
a heartbeat passes
ive loved you for nine years but i was too arrogant and scared to realize it
now im just scared
he stares at her dumbstruck
she moves even closer
i know this comes at an inopportune time but i have to ask this one really gigantic favor okay
holds her breath
let me make you happy
and in a half beat of excruciating silence
it sounds like three favors
his eyes are loving
they care for her
she swallows lost in them
but when you think about it
slides her arms around his neck and raises her mouth
the most beautiful kiss she will ever offer
all of her heart is in this and as his hands touch her body
a scream rips the world to pieces
they whirl to see
kimmy halfway up the path
her hands across her mouth as if to stem the horror that pours forth as she shrieks from her soul and
back down the path
michael bolting after her shouting her name
a frozen moment and
julianne takes off after him
all three running screaming their various emotions at the top of their lungs as workmen stop to watch from neighboring countries
kimmy staring from halfway there has an insurmountable lead
leaps into her convertible and peels out just tearing up the gravel as she rockets out of sight
no way to catch her
michael is racing for the cars
julianne sprinting her guts out losing ground with every stride
michael jumps into a cherokee
he grinds the gears
she keeps running
his engine fires
he blasts off
she keeps going
gasping for air clutching her side shes dying here
slams into a florists truck looks inside shit
next a butchers van looks inside jesus
to the world at large up ahead michael has stalled the cherokee
she still has a chance dashes to the next van
bornstein extermination a handsome rendering of a rat above the toxic materials warning flings the door open
michael speeds away
she kicks the ratmobile in gear
julianne tearing through traffic desperately struggling to keep michaels cherokee in view while she shrieks into her cellular
down the block michael whips around a corner
we follow suit to see his destination dead ahead
the dispatcher radio intrudes
uh unit four baker charlie how we cookin on that skokiie infestation
now shes steering the car tearing at the radio controls and screaming into the phone cradled on her shoulder
uh what happens if you got that methyl ethyl shit on your hands
michael rips into the train stations parking lot
we swerve around a taxi cut off harley careen into the lot
uh you got maybe thirty seconds before youre sterile
for gods sake dont touch yourself or anything
up ahead michael is out of his jeep and running
she slams on the brakes throwing herself against the wheel
uh this is one monkey zebra
it wasnt bees in the gals wall it was cats
she tears the door open
she says gas em anyway shell pay cash
how do i pay this
with julianne now racing through the lot michael vanishes into the station she plunges in after him bouncing off bystanders apologizing lunging on gasping for breath past exhaustion threatening clumsily
through the crowd like a staggering drunk catching a lucky glimpse as he heads
down a staircase to the tracks
my god whats he doing
a second wind fueled by panic and she bolts after him dancing down the steep staircase somehow without killing herself reaching the concourse to see him running for
track a train already rumbling ready to pull out she sprints after him
he disappears behind the train she falls skids springs up pushes through gaping onlookers almost there the train pulls but hes just standing there
his back to us
watching it go
her body nearly collapses with relief
she pushes herself on but her legs arent working right in their maxed out fatigue and she lopes and staggers until she comes up behind him
hes still lost in thought staring after the train
she tries to speak but theres no breath
so she puts her hands on her knees and just gasps for air like a dog
wheezing panting trying once more to speak but she cant yet and then he casually turns and
jumps out of his skin
a heart attack seeing her
croaks dont speak
he just blinks at this sweaty ripped up maniacal figure
i saw that moving
flinging both her hands across his mouth
a frozen beat
he nods okay
cautiously she takes her hands away
at least she has made him smile in spite of everything
at least shes done that
i have to make a confession
besides that i love you
this is even worse
hes waiting to hear
the e mail
you thought walter sent your boss
i wrote that
youre not saying you actually
youre saying that y
stricken with remorse wrote it yeah
im the bad guy
she nods her head wildly hair flopping
shakes her head like a two year old
pacing in circles i mean do you realize what youve
well of course you realize thats why youre confessing i mean
how could you do that
i didnt know it would get sent
i just wanted you to
get mad at kimmy
as this begins to sink in
ive done nothing but slimy underhanded despicable not even terribly imaginative things
ever since i got here
staring in his eyes
eyes she cant read at this point
to win you
to win you back
tears in her own eyes now
and i was blinded by love
like you said
shaking her head
but that doesnt excuse any part of it
i am pond scum
i am the fungus that feeds on pond scum
the layer of mucous that cruds up the fung
the pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus
and to her amazement
the trace of a smile
softly on the other hand thank you
she blinks at that
which squeezes out a tear
for loving me that much that way
just above a whisper
its pretty flattering
except it makes me fungus
well that part i knew
shes never loved him more
so you have to marry kim
because she will actually make you happy
i in contrast am a shallow neurotic psychopath with relatively little to offer
nod your head
do as youre told
he nods his head still smiling
her tears are running now
maybe she doesnt notice
just promise youll never tell me who you would have chosen
if i hadnt confessed
she chokes back a sob
cos if you would have chosen me
then i threw away a perfectly good life
just to be a decent person
which is a questionable trade off
he nods slowly
because hes supposed to
and if you would have chosen some year old punk over me
id have to kill myself
his smile keeps getting smaller
whispers ill take it to my grave
she looks around
im so glad you didnt jump on that train before
i came here looking for her
the words leave a silence
why would she come here
this is where i proposed
stares deep in her eyes
she needs to hear this
i had to cover a game in milwaukee
she saw me off
and when the train started to leave
i jumped up on the step i help the handle and without
has to admit
without a thought in my head
i shouted marry me
now her eyes tear up again
and she doesnt know why
and she gasped and covered her mouth and the train was pulling out and suddenly she screamed yes
and blew me a kiss
what a girl
i never forgot that
its two weeks
that is so romantic
which makes him reach and touch her hair
i just wonder if you know why
its because romance isnt mystery and tricks and doubts and halting unspoken longings
thats not the real romance
tears in his eyes now
the real romance is saying yes
does she know that now
he looks at his watch
sighs woulda been a nice wedding
urgently you cant believe youve lost her
sooner or later youll find her and youll look in each others eyes and youll see all that love
course if its later rather than sooner id hate to be you at six oclock
beat youve got a lot of explaining to
im just thinking of how shes hurting
like her life is over
thats little egotistical
he glares at her
but undoubtedly accurate
she claps her hands galvanized by the emergency
okay well split up
you go to every romantic place you guys have ill go
someplace brilliant and the first one who
if you find her
a gentle warning
may be hard
for you to explain
beat because the only fear she really has is
and she likes tommy lasorda
looks at her own watch
but if you do get to her first
she looks up
there is something you are authorized to say
julianne sits on the fender of this guys taxi
the driver smokes paces while she waits for a connection on her cellular
wallace egregious residence mandy speaking
its jules you guys havent had a call from say kimberly have you
oh shes slipped out the little monkey
probly with michael doin the nasty
a shallow laugh
or crying in her nachos down at comskey park
juliannes face snaps to alert
ex cuse me
i had this crank call
from some guy who thinks he saw her
i said what would a bride be doin on her wedding
you are so right
what a nerve on that guy
bring my dress to church huh
signals the driver lets go
i want to pick up a little something for the ceremony
game in progress
julianne and the bodyguard stand in the doorway of the deserted skybox
everyone walter knows is going to a wedding
the box is empty except for one cardboard container of nachos extra cheese sitting alone before a pulled back chair
she wouldnt confide in me so i called the house
feels terrible about all this
luckily i got her cousin
yeah big break there
going to the john she said
could be there awhile
julianne bursts into the enormous chaotic restroom
looks around wildly no sign of kim
from the long line of stalls
sobbing in here you bitch
now everybodys really interested
julianne ignores them strides to the stall
knocks like its a door
let me in baby or ill rip this damn thing off its non code compliant hinges
some scattered applause
from down the line
still sobbing over here nitwit
julianne moves down the line
stares at the door
we hear the soft muted crying from within
drops to her knees
bends her head low
peers under the door
what she sees prompts a sad warning
and she crawls under the door on her belly
we go with her to see
kim fully dressed perched on the closed toilet lid her knees drawn up her arms around them
and pulls herself up to her knees
kimmy tries to glare but it just isnt in her
havent you done enough
the world gets real quiet
an entire bathroom is listening
julianne cocks her head to one side
in one minute
you are going to feel so foolish
have you ever heard of
i threw my arms around your husband
and kissed him with all my heart
because i was so happy
and leans close
as kimmy flinches
whispers hes going to take
big grin the job
a stunned pole axed moment
and kimmys eyes spring open
beaming with your dad yeah
can you guess why
everything inside kimmy bursts free in a torrent of tears
and dissolves sobbing into juliannes arms
a beat for julianne to reflect and then she strokes her tenderly
well of course he loves you
kisses the top of kimmys head
very soft hell even i love you
kimmy holds her tight
from her heart
i never want to go through this again
thats entirely understandable
outside the stall
juliannes feet sticking out under the door
the two burst out of the stall hand in hand at a desperate dead run past us
hear them explode out the door and
five stalls open
women exit crying
a taxi pulls up in front of an ivy covered chapel fronted by nearly a hundred souls milling about in attitude ranging from overstimulated curiosity to clinical hyperanxiety
our girls jump out of the cab and half the crowd starts running toward us twins in the lead
cutting this short we were bonding we lost track were officially sorry now lets put it behind us
kim waves at her mom by the chapel entrance
and takes juliannes hand for support
believe me we got a bride whos worth waiting for yes
out of our way
pure blinding white
across frame floats more white this gauzy and ethereal
it settles its roots planting deeply in the brides hair
tilts up to
the face of the woman who placed it there
juliannes eyes appraising this bride we cannot see
and so softly
dont worry sugar
when he looks at you it will be as if
the words stronger
because there is no smile
hes never seen a woman before
pan down the white until we are
close on the brides perfect slippers
begins to slowly pan back up the length of an exquisite gown
we can tell from the organ the nearby thrum of expectant voices that we are nearing the moment
firmly clasping walters
keep panning the bodice the lace her throat and finally we are close on
the face of the bride
now we understand the word radiant
we also understand scared senseless
our perfect unflappable kimmy is in a trance of emotional overload where bliss and panic seamlessly blend
the organs noddling stops
kimmys eyes alerted like a small animal bearing a predator approach her thicket
suddenly the chord
the wedding march from wagners lohengrin
and we snap to
kim and walter
this is it
whispers left foot
kims pov the chapel every pew packed every neck craning this way the white satin carpet down the endless aisle to where
also in a zone of pseudo consciousness
from which he attempts a smile
kims pov whip pan the groomsmen the twins locking focus on julianne standing strong and beautiful a glow of her own in the daffodil dress
she sends her little sister a wink across the trackless miles of aisle
you can do this kid
on her fathers arm she walks the gauntlet of the worlds intrusive admiration
one step at a time
the most beautiful she will ever be
she is dazzling the crowd and managing to not throw up at the same time
and shes there
at his side
she glances back to her maid of honor just to make sure shes not working without a net
crosses her eyes
which lets the kid smile and finally take a breath
have a little fun huh
kim nods got it turns to
who stands before them with a calming presence
thank god someone has done this before
the crowd has hushed
the ministers eyes are only for two
his words are for all
michael and kimmy wrote these words
she asked me to confide mostly michael
a ripple of laughter
gentle and fine
they are setting in
so he gets to say them
a pleasant one
the crowd adjust in its seats
as michael begins
why do people get married anymore
and on these words
we snap to julianne
share her interest in the bluntness the simplicity the unorthodoxy of this beginning
why not live together amicably with no sense of obligation beyond the moment
as long as the sex is good
as long as no one more interesting has wandered into view
as long as the thousand conflicts of two individual wills remain comfortably compromised
proud to the bone
and when one feels the urge to move on to explore the new
no guilt no disgrace no promise broken
his eyes damp
against our expectation
no agony of having dishonored a time
when our hearts
and the world were different
joe nods as he hears
marriage is a lot to put up with
julianne once more
the answer must be
that there is some need basic to the human heart
the obligation of commitment
her eyes have clouded
as if michael is talking to her
some need to belong to one another in a way which rages against the notion
that all is impermanent
against the notion of mortality
and suddenly all the feeling rises in her throat
our love is bigger
than life itself
and the tears come
they come freely unhidden unnoticed
as if they were needed
looking at his bride
thats what we want
is what we do about it
kimmy smiles at him
with love bigger than life itself
we are fools in this
thank god almighty
he is done
there is a silence
boy that was good
the minister holds up a sheet of paper
for the crowd to see
mostly paragraphs crossed out in red ink
michael and kim also edited what they want me to say
the idea was were only marrying once
we have to remember it forever
lets keep to the good stuff
squints at the sheet you may kiss the bride
the minister waves this off his little joke
turns to the best man pantomimes the ring
as the hammered gold circle is handed to michael julianne absently scratches her still swollen finger
mandy taps julianne on the arm and produces
a matching ring
gives it to her
so julianne steps forward
places the second ring into kimmys waiting hand
their eyes meet and hold throughout
if anyone here can show just cause why this man and woman should not be married speak now
or forever hold your peace
julianne clears her throat
kimmys heart flutters
in the silence
juliannes wonderful smile
michael reaches for kims hand turns her gently to him
places his ring on her finger
holds her hands
i promise to love
and respect and comfort you
to hear your voice and your heart
until we are parted by death
smiles a fleeting beautiful smile
fumbles slightly putting the ring on his finger
i promise to love and respect and comfort you
to hear your voice and your heart
until we are parted by death
staring in each others eyes
a moment so fragile the minister waits an extra beat
for the record you each agree to marry the other
quickly i do
smiling i do
the minister joins their right hands
we havent said much about god this evening i know
but he is here
and he is happy
to bless his wonderful children
close now on julianne
for the inevitable moment
in that michael and kimberly have given themselves to each other by solemn vows and the exchanging of rings
unnoticed by the world
her eyes are close
i pronounce them husband and wife
those whom god has joined together let no one put asunder
the eyes open
wet brave ready for
kiss the bride
as michael does
this is what all the preparation was for
tables lights balloons the guests dancing on the hardwood floor at the base of the gazebo
the bride and groom among them relaxed and happy
two who are one
the stage the band playing
julianne conferring with the twins and the band leader clear that shes giving the instructions
then she takes her glass of champagne to the microphone
klunks it for silence
the band stops
the dancers follow
all eyes are comfortably turned to the maid of honor
she looks to the couple
just below her
then to the crowd
im a writer too not as good as michael
but i do steal from quality
she raises her glass
everyone at the table does the same
this is to my best friend
on the occasion of his wedding
shouts of support a few whistles
she tells michael
if i have truly come to know your bride as my new sister
this is in her heart
she has to stop
because she will not let herself cry
ill slip quietly away from the noisy crowd when i see the pale stars rising blooming over the oaks
looks in his eyes
ill pursue solitary pathways through the pale twilit meadows with only this one dream you come too
from four hundred hands
but not from his
he is too moved
too understanding of what he has heard
i dont have a wedding gift
but this is on loan
until you two find your song
and with that the band begins
the opening phrases of a song we have come to know
michael seems overwhelmed
julianne nods toward the gazebo
michael takes his brides hand leads her up the stairs into his arms as the twins step to the microphone and guests begin to applaud an unscheduled wedding dance
singing someday when im awfully low and the world is cold i will feel a glow just thinking of you and the way you look tonight
soft two part harmony
as perfect as the words
singing youre lovely
with your smile so warm and your cheeks so soft there is nothing for me but to love you just the way you look tonight
julianne can cry now
because shes tied with half the place
singing with each word your tenderness grows tearing my fears apart
and the laugh that wrinkles your nose touches my foolish heart
julianne begins to sing
even by the man shes singing to
singing youre lovely please dont ever change keep that breathless charm darling please arrange it cos i love you
just the way you look tonight
the band keeps playing
the dance goes on
two people lost in each other
the way its supposed to be
julianne caught in the middle of the throng
a young couple dressed for travel appear at the top of the staircase
the shout are deafening
the bride has her bouquet
she spots julianne far below
throws it her way julianne reflexively goes for it
not a fucking chance
the twins nearly trample her in the stampede mandy wresting the prize from sammys grasp
everyone cheers and then the couple is
flying down the stairs racing through the crowd with a protective phalanx of groomsmen bodyguards heading for the door for freedom
julianne trapped in the crush loses sight of the couple struggles against the flow suddenly panicked by the certainty that she will never see him before
and then hes there
he has julianne in his arms
holding her so tight
an embrace so wonderful so terrible she could go mad from the confusion alone
against the din he murmurs in her ear
wherever i go
deep deep breath
you win a few you lose a few
some get rained out
and to her surprise
very softly you have a good time
to her greater surprise
there are a few tears left after all
i did what i came to do
even softer good girl
she just cant speak now
so she doesnt
i was thinking
maybe you might visit us for awhile
weve got the room made up
this fucking guy
god she loves him
ill think about it
oh youre more than okay
just above a whisper
and with the last of her strength
if the sun comes up ill see you tomorrow huh
at the other end
ill play those odds
you have sweet dreams
we hear the click
she turns her back on the stars
she walks from frame
