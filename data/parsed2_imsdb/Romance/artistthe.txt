written by michel hazanavicius silent film illustrated musically with some title cards to indicate the dialogues with actors whose lips move when they speak although we never hear their voices
the images are in black and white in format
the letters of the titles come up on a title card typical of the s
elegant motifs around the edge of the frame and in the background there are geometrical shapes reminiscent of the light beams of a film premiere
behind is a stylized town
the titles end in a fade to black
on black the date appears on the screen in a futuristic s laboratory a man in tail coat and bow tie is being tortured
ultrasound is being piped into his ears
its incredibly painful
title card im not telling
i wont talk
his torturers cold men of science in white coats gradually increase the volume
the pain seems unbearable the volume reaches level maximum the man passes out
guards wearing long leather overcoats throw the man into a cell
as the man is lying there on the ground a dog wiggles through the bars at the window
the dog a jack russell jumps on top of the man visibly his master and begins to lick his face
the man opens one eye
when he sees his dog he cant help cracking a smile
the man now on his feet looks in pain
despite the pain he motions to his dog who begins to bark in lively fashion
outside the cell the guard looks curious about the noise
he goes to the door opens the spy flap and finds himself face to face with the man eye to eye just a couple of inches apart
the man moves his eyes in such a way that he hypnotizes the guard
superimposed on the screen a spinning black and white spiral until the dazed guard take his keys opens the door and releases the man and his dog
the man the hero thus imprisons the guard without harming him then runs over to the guards desk
his ears are still causing him pain but he opens a drawer and takes out his belongings a top hat which he snaps open and a mask which he puts
over his head to conceal his eyes
we catch up with the masked man walking down corridors
he suddenly stops copied by his dog who follows him like his shadow
the man on his guard has spotted another guard where two corridors meet
with a look he orders his dog to move forwards into the guards line of sight
the guard looks over at the animal
using his fingers the hero pretends to shoot his dog
the dog collapses plays dead
the guard increasingly curious gets to his feet
he slowly approaches the motionless dog
when he comes close he is attacked from the side by the hero who quickly puts him out of action with a mere punch
the masked man then rushes to another cell and releases a young female prisoner
she too is wearing evening dress
as she is thanking him he staggers and clutches his ears in pain
title card can i help you in some way
title card no
i dont get helped
i give the help around here
he composes himself
she casts him an admiring glance
then in view of the urgency of their situation they escape at a run
they come out of a house that is lost in the hills climb into a bugatti sports car that the man starts by rubbing two wires together and speed off
the car speeds along the road
its occupants turn round to check they arent being followed
the guard who got knocked out picks himself up realizes whats happened and dashes over to his office
he grabs a radio emitter and begins sending a message
the hero the young woman and the dog come to a halt in the bugatti on the air field by a telegraph pole whose wires lead
to a watch tower
in the watch tower a radio receptor is vibrating
a soldier approaches listens and suddenly understands
he grabs hold of his gun and goes out onto the air field only to find the fugitives
he tries to shoot at them as he draws closer but the hero manages to throw an airplane propeller at him before climbing inside where the woman and dog are
waiting for him
the airplane begins to move
the soldier shoots
the airplane is positioning itself on the runway while the soldier continues to fire
the aircraft gains speed
the soldier is still shooting but too late as the heroo pulls back the joystick and the airplane takes to the sky
the soldier is furious but the hero is all smiles as he looks back towards the ground and shouts something
title card free georgia forever
the airplane flies away into the evening sky
a little later in the night still at the controls the man is fighting not to fall asleep
behind him the women is sleeping the dog is lying in her arms
suddenly she is awoken by explosions happening close by
the man doesnt understand it either he tries to pick up altitude but quickly notices that the explosions are in fact pretty and inoffensive
he consults a calendar dial on the control panel that shows it is july th immediately understands and bursts into laughter
title card weve arrived welcome to france
as the music picks up the tune of the marseillaise the airplane flies away through the exploding fireworks
the words the end appear on the screen
from the moment they parked the car onwards we become absorbed by whats happening around the screening of end of this film
behind the screen weve seen the actor who plays the hero his name is george valentin closely studying the reactions of the audience
he was standing close to his dog motioning to it not to make a noise
the dogs name is jack
in the same area weve also seen the lead actress
her name is constance gray
she too looks tense and is latched onto the arm of a pleasant looking man who is chewing anxiously on a cigar
the man looks rich but a little weak
hes surely the producer
in the house much of the audience is open mouthed excited immobile and often wide eyed
in the pit a symphony orchestra plays to accompany the film
now that the film is ending and the last note is sounding the cast anxiously awaits the audiences verdict which after two or three seconds of silence bursts into thunderous
applause to the great joy of the actor and the people around him especially the actress and the producer who kiss each other on the lips
two theater hands bring down the curtain
the lights come on
george valentin comes onto the stage and acknowledges the audience they are cheering for him
he is so happy he dances a few tap steps to express his joy then he acknowledges the orchestra before finally motioning to someone in the wings to join him
jack the dog trots over in response
the crowd laughs and cheers george waves to the dog jack waves back then waves at the audience the people are loving it
in the wings constance is fuming with rage but on stage george is pretending with his fingers to pull at the dog who fakes death
thunderous applause again
behind the actress the producer cant hold back a smile and this enrages the actress still more
suddenly george hamming it up remembers something hed forgotten and asks someone from the other side of the wings to join him
she comes over smiling to the audience and says something to george with a smile
title card ill get you for that
she waves but we can tell that her smile is set between her teeth
she isnt feeling comfortable
george motions firing a gun with his fingers but she does not fall down merely casts him a very funny glance
george looks at his fingers not understanding why they dont work anymore then mimes throwing them away behind him as though theyve become useless
constance stalks back off into the wings in annoyance but the audience is ecstatic
once in the wings the actress sticks up her middle finger at george and exaggeratedly mouths so he can read her lips put this up your ass
george grinning broadly responds by clapping his hands in applause then leaves the stage executing a few more dance steps as he does so
the audience is delighted
as he comes off stage george gets soundly told off by constance but still grinning he motions towards the audience who are still asking for more
the producer although delighted by the successful reception makes a weak attempt to calm the actress down
as for george he returns to the stage the audience roars
he pretends to want to leave the stage and mimes bumping into an invisible wall just as hes leaving the stage
george holds his nose the audience goes wild constance gets even madder and while george carries on clowning about the producer too breaks into a beaming smile
hes probably realized that george has the audience on his side
constance furious storms off
she is followed by the producer who is trying to placate her although it looks like hes got his work cut out for him
outside we are in front of a typically american movie theater decked out with all the accessories of a grand premiere
the entrance is lit up there are crowds gathered on the sidewalk cops are guarding the red carpet with a cordon of bodies etc
george comes out causing the crowds mainly young women to press forwards and the photographers flashes to spark into life
the cops are struggling to maintain control of the situation as george poses for the photographers and waves at his many fans
in the crowd a young woman right at the front is staring at him in rapture
she drops her bag and as she bends to pick it up a swell in the crowd pushes her underneath the arms of the policeman in front of her out
of the crowd and into george
she stares at him more in love than ever delighted to be there
the police wait for someone to give orders
george doesnt quite know what to do
the young woman finally bursts out laughing which after a moment of shock causes george to laugh too thus placating the cops and tacitly signaling to the photographers that they
can take pictures of the scene
the flashes seem to lend the woman self confidence who in a very carefree manner begins to clown about in front of them
george is delighted at the sight by the whole scene and realizing this the young woman steals a kiss
the image becomes static then dissolves into the printed picture on the front page of the hollywood reporter newspaper along with three other pictures of the scene and the headline
whos the very same newspaper is being read by an elegant woman sitting at a sumptuous breakfast table
we are in the large dining room of an ultra luxurious hollywood villa
all around her are magnificent furniture superb paintings and objets dart including a beautiful trio of monkeys one hiding its eyes one with hands clasped to its ears and the
third obscuring its mouth
george comes into the room and kisses his wife
she responds with cold indifference
you could cut the atmosphere with a knife
the woman hands george the newspaper
he knows whats up but tries to laugh it off
she doesnt find it funny is as cold as stone and barely looks at him
she is obviously extremely annoyed with him
george picks up his dog and puts it on the table
jack drops his head to one side and his big eyes implore seem to implore her forgiveness
its the exact expression of someone asking to be loved but doris is implacable
she gets up walks away and does not turn back
left on his own george has a closed expression on his face
he seems unhappy to have hurt his wifes feelings
then he realizes that jack is on the table in a ridiculous pose and signals to him to get down
the dog obeys
george looks at the paper the cause of his problems
thirteen white letters placed on a hillside
below in town a bus
inside the full bus is the young woman from the day before
her name is peppy miller
she is proudly holding the hollywood reporter with her face on the front page and is more or less discreetly making suggestive glances hoping that someone recognizes her
but the people around her from working and middle class backgrounds are visibly on their way to work and remain impervious to her game
she carefully puts the paper away in her bag in which four or five copies of the newspaper are already carefully tucked away then gets off the bus at the
she goes through the main gates of kinograph studios and heads towards where they hire extras
in a courtyard fifty odd people are waiting some sitting on wooden crates others standing
there are mums with kids guys with animals men dressed as cowboys etc
peppy is among them sitting next to a man of about sixty who is dressed in a highly stylized fashion
his job is obviously that of a butler
peppy proudly shows him the picture in the newspaper
the man leans to take a closer look unfolds the newspaper sees the headline smiles and then folds it back up again and returns it to peppy text side up
highlighting the headline whos that girl
peppy is a bit annoyed to have been put in her place but deep down she knows hes right
nobody knows who she is
she puts the newspaper away
a man who visibly works for the studio some assistant or other comes into the courtyard climbs on a crate and makes an announcement
title card contemporary film
five girls who can dance
all the men who had pressed forwards turn on their heels leaving the assistant surrounded only by women
the man says something to one girl who begins to dance
he motions to her that its ok and she heads off towards the wardrobe section
he does the same with a second girl and she gets hired too
then its peppys turn
she puts a lot of energy into a few top class tap steps impressing the guy to such an extent that he smiles admiringly then signals that shes hired
full of self assurance that her lucky day has come peppy heads off towards wardrobe too swinging her hips as she pauses in front of the butler
title card the name is miller
she finishes with an exaggerated wink before walking on leaving behind the impassive butler
in the lobby george is preparing to leave the house
he waves at the huge full length portrait of himself waving and smiling whilst wearing a tuxedo
he looks great in the painting and george is delighted to see and to wave to himself
later george in a luxurious car driven by his chauffeur arrives at the kinograph studios with his dog
the guard at the entrance smiles broadly at them and waves
as he walks towards his dressing room everyone smiles at him
hes not always fooled by these signs of respect and apes a few smiles himself
in his dressing room wearing a tailcoat and top hat george is finishing putting his make up on
he has a white face and dark lips and eyes
his chauffeur is signing autographs for him on full length photographs of himself george with his dog
george says to him title card go and buy a piece of jewelry for my wife
a nice piece to make it up to her
the chauffeur nods
having finished his mask up george picks up a photo looks at it closely and then writes on it
as he leaves the dressing room we see the photograph
hes written woof woof on it and signed it with the paw print of a dog
were on a film set the crew is setting up a shot
the director is unhappy with a screen positioned behind a bay window and he sends it off
title card remove that screen and bring me another one
on the double
two hands pick up the screen and carry it away
george arrives on set everyone smiles at him
he sits down on the chair which bears his name
the producer whom we saw the previous day at the premiere arrives
his name is zimmer and hes flanked by and followed around at every moment by two secretaries and two assistants
one of them hands him the hollywood reporter and zimmer before hes even come to a halt talks to george as he shows him the front page
he is visibly upset
george looks a lot more relaxed he says hello and vaguely tries to reassure him
but zimmer persists still pointing at the newspaper
title card because of this childish nonsense theres nothing about the film before page
behind george the two set hands come back with a new screen of sky scenery and wait standing just next to george
as they are holding it there is a three foot gap underneath
while the producer is talking to him georges attention is drawn by a lovely pair of womens legs that have come to stand behind the screen the top half of
the body being hidden by it
george acknowledges the sight with a smile and is about to bring his attention back to the on going discussion when his attention is drawn away again by a noise
that of the tap steps the female legs are making presumably as a warm up
george smiles in recognition and responds with a few tap steps of his own
the womens legs instantly stop seem to think a moment and then answer back but with a jump in the complexity of the steps
a tap dialogue ensues between the two pairs of legs until the set hands the path before them now cleared pick up their screen of scenery and walk off with
the screen moves away and as it disappears reveals that the upper body belongs to a young woman
she pulls a face meaning here i am
and of course its peppy except that she immediately realizes who she is dealing with visibly she wasnt expecting this at all and feels completely ridiculous and uncomfortable
her joyful expression gradually becomes one of abject apology but george is roaring with laughter
after a short pause zimmer makes the connection
he checks the front page of the paper and recognizes her
then he begins shouting at her and all she can do is lower her head unable to reply
he gestures that shes fired and for her to get out and she starts to go completely distraught
shes just made a couple of steps when george stops her and tells her to come back
everyone is surprised most of all him
zimmer cant believe it and so doesnt respond at first
theres bad feeling between them as though neither wanted this sudden conflict but like it had always been there tangible
everyone on the set seems to be waiting for zimmer to react but to their surprise after a long moment of hesitation he walks away without saying a thing
peppy looks at george gratefully smiling but seems a little preoccupied as though she might have made a mistake
everyone on set gets back to work
theyre about to start shooting
the director is showing george what he has to do
the scene is happening in a cabaret restaurant
george has to cross a dance floor but each time he is stopped by a guy ringing a bell to signal it is time to change dancing partner
george finds himself dancing with peppy one moment and in the arms of a very fat man the next the director finds the gag hysterical
the scene is shot several times from three different angles
each time george dances with peppy and each time the nature of their rapport changes
to begin with they are happy and laughing but then with time less so
then they become embarrassed and then things get worse
we start the sequence again and again to the sound of the clapperboard counting the number of takes but the eroticism between them is the only thing that stands out
from the scene every thing else goes unnoticed
ultimately no flirting or suggestiveness has gone on just the very obvious beginning of feelings between them that they find disturbing
its probably love
later on in the dressing room corridor peppy holding an envelope goes up to georges door
she knocks waits for a reply then enters
theres nobody there
she hesitates not sure whether to leave or stay
finally she goes into the room and places the envelope addressed to george valentin on the dresser
then she attentively looks around the dressing room
she looks at the objects and photos and notices hanging from a coat stand georges jacket on a hanger and his hat which sits on a hook above it
the way the clothes are disposed looks like georges silhouette except that the clothes are empty
she goes over strokes the jacket and little by little brings george to life through his clothes
she puts her right hand into the sleeve and touches her own waist
as its georges sleeve she makes it look like his arm has come to life as though george has come to life
even more so since her left hand is stroking the jacket as though george were inside
she takes pleasure from the embrace and when george comes into the room she slowly removes her hand without any rush
george sees her they look at each other
he closes the door but doesnt go over to her instead going over to the mirror
he looks at her she at him
he motions to her to approach
he stares at her face for a while before he speaks
title card if you want to be an actress you need to have something no one else has
he takes a make up pencil and draws a beauty spot above her upper lip
she looks at herself in the mirror and smiles
she likes it
she turns towards him and quite naturally folds into his arms
the dog watches them curiously with its head leaning to one side
they are probably about to kiss when georges chauffeur comes into the room and catches them
george swiftly moves aside and there is a moment of discomfort
the chauffeur unwraps a parcel and takes out a large and beautiful pearl necklace
george is intrigued by the necklace and turns away from peppy
she understands that george has his own life that their embrace was just a stolen moment and slowly leaves looking back at george as she does so
he does not look at her
she leaves the room
once he has studied and necklace and is satisfied george turns back towards peppy but she is no longer there
the chauffeur exits the room
when he is alone george looks at himself in the mirror
his expression shows that he things he is the stupidest man in the world
he mimes shooting himself in the temple with his fingers but its the dog which collapses into its play dead pose
the next morning hes having breakfast with his wife
the atmosphere is still dreadful but this time hes not making any effort either
he disdainfully watches doris eat
she is cutting up strawberries using a knife and fork
george watches her smiles and continues to watch
except its not doris hes watching
instead its peppy whos tucking into her food and talking and laughing vivaciously
george is with her with an expression of love on his face
hes laughing with her when suddenly reality bites
hes still sitting opposite doris and shes staring at him because she doesnt understand why he is laughing
she visibly finds him ridiculous
he stops laughing and breakfast carries on as normal
we see several quick sequences which indicate time passing breakfasts with george and doris where the atmosphere is increasingly dreadful
doris scribbles on photos of george in the press draws on moustaches large spectacles etc
short extracts of george in various films in which he portrays a pirate then a cowboy then william tell etc
we also see him in someday in july in the sequence he shot with peppy and the fat male dancer
movie goers reacting to the films but the way the images are edited cut with breakfast images could mean they are reacting to them too
among the audience is peppy miller
shes trying to concentrate fully on the film and is pushing away the handsome young man shes with who is trying to kiss her
we see her later at the movies again but this time alone
we see her playing some bit parts maid dancer etc
her roles seem to get a little bigger
we notice that she now wears the beauty spot that shell keep forever
her name climbs up the ranks in the title sequences of films until it appears on its own
we see her signing a contract in a small office she seems happy
george signs a big contract with zimmer as photographers take pictures
he smiles broadly whereas zimmer looks like his smile is a little forced
the date appears on the screen
george dressed as a musketeer is sword fighting with three middle ages thugs in a tavern
he kills two of them but unfortunately loses his epee when fighting the third
but when the third man attacks george merely dodges with a sleight of body and puts his attacker out of action with a right hook
calm restored he smiles and waves in brotherly fashion to a mysterious man who is trying to hide underneath his long cape
the man stands up throws aside his cape and reveals himself to be
he puts his bicorne hat back on and warmly thanks an astonished george
napoleon says something to him and george respectfully bows walks away from him still bowing then turns and runs
once out of the decor he bumps right into a worried looking zimmer who is followed by his loyal assistants
george is in a playful mood
zimmer tells him title card i want to show you something
george seems astonished that zimmer is leaving the set and not filming but agrees
napoleon walks past them very imperially and gestures royally to a technician to bring him a chair
the technician doesnt miss the chance to remind the man that he is only an extra and not napoleon
zimmer his guards and george still dressed as a musketeer come into a screening room in which a dozen or so very serious looking people are waiting
they sit down and zimmer very proudly and self confidently gestures to an assistant who passes on the message to the projectionist
the room goes dark
the screening begins
on screen we see a card that indicates its a sound shooting test for a talking scene
then constance appears the actress from the spy film
shes standing in front of a mic and she tests it delighted to be there
we see her again the microphone has disappeared and she acts out a scene
its a monologue
her acting is terrible very theatrical but the audience can hear her
it is however awful
in the screening room the audience seems stunned by what they see hear
they are fascinated
they then begin to congratulate each other and slap zimmer on the back
zimmers pride seems to grow by the second
george who at first seemed very surprised slowly begins a snigger which gradually has become a belly laugh when the actress earnestly ends her monologue
when the lights come up george is laughing uncontrollably way beyond the bounds of mere mockery as his sincerity is obvious
the people present are embarrassed and zimmer is deeply put out
george still laughing leaves the room waving an apology with his hands as he goes but also pointing to the screen to explain why hes laughing
zimmer feels even more humiliated
fade to black on his face
were back with george in his dressing room
hes removing his make up
he moves some ordinary object and the object as he moves it makes a noise
we hear the noise it makes
really hear it
its the first time weve heard a sound that comes from within the film itself
one second later george realizes that the object made a noise
he moves it again the object makes a noise again
george is worried
he tries another object and obtains noise again
his dog barks and we hear it
he gets up chair makes a noise and says something to his dog but no sound comes out of his mouth when he speaks
he realizes this
panic sets in he turns to the mirror and tries talking again but still no sound comes out
not understanding whats happening the feeling of panic fully blossoms and he flees his dressing room
noisy laughing dancers pass in the corridor others are talking or shouting and even if we cant make out what they are saying they are all making sound
george tries to talk to them but his voice remains silent
one dancer seeing his fright bursts into throaty laughter
george rushes through the milling crowd the sound of which is becoming increasingly loud
and bursts out into the courtyard of the studio that is now suddenly deserted and silent
in front of him a feather eddies slowly to the ground carried by the breeze
it finally lands making a completely abnormal and disproportionate noise like that of a building crashing to the ground in slow motion
george screams but again his cry is silent
george awakes with a start
hes in bed and is having trouble shaking off his nightmare
the film continues as normal in other words silent
his wife is sleeping by his side
he gets up taking care not to make a sound
george calms down as he sits in the living room alone in the darkness
jack still sleepy has just curled into a ball next to him to fall back to sleep
george smiles and gives him a pat
driven by his chauffeur george crosses town heading for the studios
the car goes through the studio gates
theres nobody there
george gets out
he goes into the courtyard
theres nobody there either
he goes into the studio and heads for the set
there is still no one about
he doesnt understand and goes back outside
outside in the deserted courtyard a feather eddies towards the ground carried by the breeze
george is watching it drift to the ground when suddenly a gust of wind sends it soaring back into the sky
george follows it with his eyes and notices a man crossing between two sets
he looks like some kind of set hand or assistant a working man in any case
george calls to him
the two men draw close and george asks him whats happening
the man takes the days newspaper out of his pocket and hands it to george before walking off
george reads kinograph studios stop all silent productions to work exclusively on talkies
despite the secretarys attempts to stop him a furious george storms into zimmers office
zimmer is in a meeting with some men
they are probably engineers in view of the attention being given to the plans lying on the desk
everyone is surprised by georges rude entry
the engineers seem embarrassed but zimmer smiles and politely asks them to leave as though asking for their understanding
as they head for the door some of them drop their heads so as not to meet georges eyes whereas others look him right between the eyes but without any
this exchange causes a strange unpleasant feeling within him
he seems embarrassed
its perhaps due to the rudeness of his eruption into the office but its more likely due to the looks hes been given
for the first time for ages he has not been looked at how a star is normally looked at with respect desire and admiration but like any ordinary man is
looked at or worse still how a superfluous man is looked at
as george realizes that his status has just changed zimmer invites him to sit down
then speaks to him in a friendly manner
title card we belong to another age you and i george
nowadays the world talks
he talks to him looks a little embarrassed while george takes it on the chin not knowing how to respond
title card people want to see new faces
george reaches deep down into himself and makes an effort to bring up a smile
title card paramount will be delighted
they still want me
zimmer responds with a pursing of the lips that is more damning than any counter argument could be
as though hes telling george he can always give it a go
george understands whats happening
zimmer is sorry
title card im sorry
the public wants fresh blood
and the public is never wrong
george gets to his feet
title card its me the people want and its my films they want to see
and im going to give them to them
zimmer nods with another pursing of the lips as though he cant wait to see that
george seems very sure of himself
title card i dont need you
go make your talking movies
im going to make them a beautiful film
as george leaves in disgust his eyes are drawn to an advertising feature representing the new faces of kinograph studios
among the medallion framed young portraits george recognizes that of peppy miller
he glances up at zimmer
title card fresh blood
the two men exchange a last glance then george exits
outside he feels a few seconds of discouragement but as he meets the gaze of the engineers waiting in the secretarys antechamber he puffs up his chest and walks tall
out of the office
going down the stairs from the offices he passes a laughing peppy who is accompanied by two young and charming men perfect specimens of americas golden youth
she is coming up he is going down
when she notices him she stops already one step above of him
she has a beaming smile and is truly delighted to see him
he is delighted too although his mood is very different
title card him how are you
title card her fantastic
ive been given a lead role
isnt it wonderful
he nods we see in his eyes that hes terribly happy for her
they look at each other she laughs
then she fumbles in her bag for something with which to note down her telephone number on a piece of paper
it takes a while and is a little chaotic she apologizes but he visibly takes a lot of pleasure out of watching her
she finally gets the number down and hands it to him telling him to call her to really call her
in response he casts a glance over to the young men waiting for her higher up the stairs and she bursts out laughing
she leans towards him to say something
title card gadgets
she looks at him flirtatiously
then she gestures again for him to call her and he nods even though we think that he probably will not do so
she leaves and he watches her go before beginning his decent once more
once at the top she turns back to call out to george he too has turned to look
she smiles at him breaks into a few tap steps for old times sake then blows him a kiss
he catches the kiss with a smile pretends to make it disappear in his other hand like a magician then shows her the inside breast pocket of his jacket as
proof that hes keeping it safe and warm
she laughs loudly and goes on her way
he watches her walk away with admiration in his eyes
she vanishes and georges smile takes on a note of melancholy and then he leaves too
george comes home
doris is there scribbling on a magazine but he takes no notice of her
when the dog jumps into his arms however he greets it affectionately
doris is vexed
a while later hes running jack through his tricks when doris arrives
title card we have to talk george
title card or not
she insists but he doesnt listen
hes with his dog
she gets annoyed he doesnt answer she ends up throwing jack
george cannot forgive her for doing so he looks at her in disgust
she starts to cry
title card im unhappy george
he answers without looking at her
title card so are millions of other people me for instance
thanks to a montage of shot frames photos and press cuttings we see george begin making his film the first clap of the board that shows hes both the films
producer and director
the film is called tears of love and it tells the tale of an english adventurer played by himself accompanied by a young woman an old man who looks like
a professor and who is probably the father of the young woman and lastly an african tribe represented as savages and whose humanity remains to be proven
we see george in the various stages of preparation writing re writing directing acting signing a lot of checks but also leaving very early in the morning to set up
shots with his collaborators etc
he looks fulfilled like he truly believes in what hes doing despite the tiredness hes feeling
his dog has a role in the film too doing tricks
george looks very happy very committed
he takes a supple branch feeds it through the sleeves of a womans blouse and by holding the two ends of the branch out in front of him dances with
the imaginary woman
everyone around him is happy and laughing
hes not shooting a comedy however its obviously a drama of some sort from what we see of the set and the way the actors play their role
then appear on screen the mock ups of posters they are shown on the set to george
he chooses the one in which he is most prominent its a poster depicting a cutesy melodrama and bears the release date october th
in the street at the entrance to a movie theater george sees a large beauty spot film poster
the poster shows peppy close up wearing a magnificent and jauntily positioned chapka over one eye
she is incredibly stylish but in no way vampish more the image of a young comedy debut
george looks at her peppy seems to be smiling at him
he smiles back
then his smile becomes strained
hes noticed something
the two theater employees are sticking a banner over the poster that reveals the release date of beauty spot its also october th
then we see advertising inserts and full page press articles appearing one after the other creating a montage of images with a very s feel
get some peps with peppy
and a close up on her smiling mischievous face
the girl next door the girl youll love to love young and pretty etc
with a photo of peppy each time posters of the film and then everywhere the face that its a talking movie
talking talking talking
as for george his image is a lot more austere the photographs show him as very serious
and the captions are like im not a muppet anymore im an artist
were in a smart restaurant
george has his back to the room and is eating with his chauffeur
peppy comes into the restaurant and comes to sit just behind george
they are back to back
she is with several young men two of whom are journalists and they are interviewing her
title card your first film doesnt come out until tomorrow and yet youre already the new darling of hollywood
how do you explain that
she starts by bursting into laughter which draws georges attention
he turns round to listen to the rest of peppys answer
title card i dont know maybe its because i talk
and people hear me
she continues talking obviously happy that people are interested in her
she doesnt see george smiling behind her
title card people are sick to death of those old actors who pull faces to make themselves understood
she continues talking with the casual arrogance of youth
behind her georges smile vanishes
title card anyway its normal for the young to take over from the old thats life
make way for youth
george is hurt
he gets up and before he leaves gestures silently that if she wants his place all she has to do is take it
she watches him leave and immediately regrets what shes just said
its the day of the films release october th
george opens his front door
his chauffeur is outside
the mans expression announces bad news
hes holding the days press
the huge headlines talk of a stock market crash a black thursday a catastrophe
dressed in a robe george is on the telephone in the living room
the atmosphere is stifling
he hangs up
his chauffeur looks at him inquisitively
george replies as though lost in thought
title card it would seem that were ruined
the chauffeur takes it on the chin with as much reserve as he can muster but george continues
title card thats the best case scenario
he almost laughs not so the chauffeur
now wearing a suit george is sitting at his desk
lying in front of him are the front pages of newspapers reporting the crash
he looks for something on the inside pages of one paper and reads
next to a large picture of peppy theres a review of his own film beginning tears of love old and boring
he shuts the paper and searches for something in the drawer of his desk
he takes out a piece of paper
its the telephone number that peppy had scribbled down for him
he looks at it moves closer to the telephone hesitates looks at the paper again then puts the scrap of paper back in the drawer without making the call
peppy awakes in bed with a start
she doesnt know what has woken her up
she looks around looks at the phone seems perplexed
then a mans arm invites her to lie back down she does
still at his desk george gets up and goes to the window
he seems lost in thought
an extract from tears of love in which we see george holding the young woman in his arms take part in a cliche d african dance with shields spears and
all the african accoutrements attributed by westerners at the time
george and the woman are complacently watching the dance when george says to the young woman
title card lets go back norma
theyve never seen a white woman before and i dont want to take any risks
theres hardly anyone in the theater
the people that are there look bored more than anything
at the back smoking a cigarette george takes the failure on the chin
one couple gets to their feet and leaves the theater
as the man reaches george he recognizes him and casts him a glance that seems to say goodness old chap this ones not up to much
george doesnt know what to say in reply
outside george comes out still smoking his cigarette
on the sidewalk people are cheerfully waiting in line
george walks up the line and comes to a movie house thats playing the beauty spot talking movie
a huge poster depicts peppy and the people in the line seem excited and delighted to be going to see the film
its visibly a success
george takes it on the chin
inside the car behind the implacable chauffeur george is talking to himself as though hes re running the story in his head and searching for what he might have done
better or differently
once home he finds a photo of himself on the floor
it has been defaced with a scribbled moustache spectacles and a big nose
theres a note to him scribbled on the back
we read it at the same time as him
its over george
youve got a fortnight to collect your souvenirs together and get out of the house
you should go see beauty spot its incredible
george takes it on the chin and leaves revealing behind him the portrait of himself wearing a tuxedo smiling and waving
as for peppy shes in the theater watching tears of love
shes with a handsome young man who seems bored
george is wearing shorts and an explorers hat
he is sinking in sinking sand
the young woman is screaming and the dog barking
the africans are panicking but theres nothing anyone can do
george stops struggling and looks deep into the eyes of the young woman
he says gently title card farewell norma
i never loved you
its obvious hes only saying that so that she can forget him and move on with her life but it doesnt wash and the young woman weeps all the more
terribly moved by this last sacrifice on his part
in the balcony peppy is speechless and her face impassive
on screen george and the young women exchange a last glance as georges face gradually sinks into the sand
next to peppy the young man sits watching her
she sees sad
on screen george has disappeared into the mire
only one hand stays in the air for several seconds more in a tortured pose that of a dying man trying to hold on to the wind
peppys companion seems to find the film far too long and doesnt understand why they havent already left
the hand has disappeared
the young woman is in a state of shock rigid with a look of horror on her face
she is no doubt about to be put to certain death
the dog turns round and walks off with head and tail lowered
the end appears on the screen
peppy seems moved
she is shaking her head from side to side
evening has fallen on the town
on the ground lies an old page from a newspaper that bears a picture of george
a mans feet trample the picture
george is at home
two bottles are apparent and obviously drunk he is staring out the window
the projection of raindrops sliding down the window look like tears running down his face
and jacks face too
george is pulled out of his stupor as he hears something
he opens the door
she immediately notices that george is drunk
her smile tenses a little
title card i wanted to talk i
george looks at her
title card i saw tears of love
george nods and answers
title card and so youve come to get your money back
she smiles stiffly not knowing how to react
title card too much face pulling
she stops smiling because its not funny at all
its bitter even
theres an embarrassed silence
softly she tries to explain
title card about last night
she stops because george is not looking at her anymore
hes watching the arrival of the young smiling handsome and wholesome man who is with peppy
george bears a melancholy smile
title card youre right
make way for youth
the young man shakes georges hand
hes obviously a nice lad and very polite
title card im so happy to meet you
my dad just loves you
he says it very nicely with no ulterior motive but george is cut to the quick
the comment wounds him and peppy notices
she cuts short the meeting by smiling and upping the cheerfulness stakes as though to kid george she hasnt noticed any embarrassment or perceived anything that might have shocked or
hurt him during their encounter
title card ok
well well be off now
ill call you soon
george smiles politely
she leaves taking the handsome jock with her
george watches them leave
as does his dog who sits with his head and ears hanging low as though very disappointed
george watches peppy walking away then steps forwards and sits down on the steps leading up to the house
as she gets into the car peppy seems surly unhappy even for the first time
she turns her back on her companion
title card take me home
id like to be alone
george watches the car leave then goes and sits on a bench next to the front door
but the bench breaks and george finds himself on the ground next to the dog
george remarks evenly to jack title card see could be it just wasnt my day
in the rain a worker is taking down letters from the facade of a theater
of tears of love only the word tears remains
peppy is facing her mirror and putting her make up on
she takes a break looking a little sad
someone some kind of assistant opens the door to her dressing room and says something like you need to hurry up
she nods and gets back to work
alternate shots of three or four film posters and frames from them which illustrate peppys rising fame
her name moves higher up the posters and into bigger letters
the films are called the rookie the brunette the girl next door and finally on the roof
we catch up with her in a close up applying her make up
the camera pulls back and we see that not only is she not putting the make up on herself a make up artist is doing that but there are in
fact four pairs of hands getting busy around her two make up girls a hairdresser and a wardrobe assistant
peppy fortunately has stayed completely natural and doesnt seem to take any of it seriously
as the last touch is put in place peppy gets to her feet and turns round
at her feet lie a dozen pairs of shoes each pair as magnificent as the next and all in their swanky boxes
peppy tries on a pair
close up of her feet
crossfade to a mans pair of shoes with used heels and uppers
georges dog comes to sit at his feet
the date is superimposed on the screen
the camera climbs up his legs to reveal george lying fully dressed in his bed obviously at home in view of his attitude
and even if his suit is still pretty smart hes become more common less unattainable
he seems to have lost whatever it was that made him so superb
primarily hes a bit drunk somewhat hesitant
george gets up and closes his murphy bed the kind of bed that slots up into the wall to look like a closet
then he walks across the living area
his home has changed too its fallen in class and is a lot more modest than the one we were used to seeing him in
we do however recognize some of the objects furniture and paintings from his old house notably the huge portrait of him smiling
he goes into the kitchen which is open onto the rest of the apartment
theres nothing in the refrigerator
he looks for something to drink but theres only one bottle left in the rack
he lifts it up
he opens a closet
inside a tuxedo hangs among a number of bare hangers
in a pawnshop george still a little drunk is selling his tuxedo
the pawnbroker and he are visibly disagreeing on the price but of course its george who folds first and hands over the tuxedo
the pawnbroker counts out the bills and hands them to george who in a fit of pride leaves a tip as he leaves his dignity intact even in the face
at home george is drinking and watching his chauffeur fix some food
he seems preoccupied
title card how longs it been since i paid you last clifton
the chauffeur answers as he carries on doing what hes doing
title card been one year now sir
george gets up visibly thinking that he shouldnt have done that that its wrong
he go gets the keys and a jacket comes back and gives them to the chauffeur
title card youre fired
keep the car
get yourself a job someplace else
the chauffeur refuses george insists
they dont agree but george ends up throwing him out even though weve understood that hes doing it for cliftons benefit and not through any unkindness
once outside the chauffeur doesnt move
he stays next to the car
george watches him through the window
the chauffeur still doesnt budge
george pulls the curtains
in the evening george looks out between the curtains the chauffeur is still there
george turns on his heels and gets into his murphy bed
george is in bed with his eyes open
outside the chauffeur is still in the same position
the next morning george gets up and goes to look from the window
the chauffeur has gone
george is a little sad but thats just the way it is
he looks around at his home
a little later george looks at himself in a mirror
we pass from him to his reflection which he hides by placing his drink against the mirror
a sign says that the effects of george valentin are to be auctioned
furniture costumes objets dart and paintings on september th
there arent many people in the room just five or six
george is standing at the back smoking a cigarette
his position and demeanor are exactly like when he was watching the screening of tears of love from the back of the room with the verdict of failure in the
hes looking a little unsteady on his feet probably due to the hip flask hes necking that seems to contain liquor
the objects go under the hammer one by one
we see the three monkeys go by notably hear no evil speak no evil see no evil
two buyers especially are raising the prices by bidding against each other a distinguished and reserved looking man and a lady of a certain age who looks a bit severe
to the point of bigotry
they dont seem perfectly comfortable but they are the only two buying
a few crossfades the display table emptying faces hands being raised hammer falling sold labels show us the lots disappearing every single item is sold
george is now with the auctioneer hes studying the list of items as auction assistants busy themselves around him carrying and packing the sold lots
the auctioneer who is putting on his coat congratulates george
title card well done
it all sold theres nothing left
george nods but his smile seems a little ironic
he leaves the room
on the stairway as hes leaving he is joined by the distinguished looking man who puts on his coat and leaves
they leave at the same time
the man crosses the street we follow him
he gets into a car
peppy is sitting in the back
shes alone and watching george walk off with his unsteady gait
the man casts a glance to ask her what he should do next
peppy with a forced smile motions that they can leave
as the man starts up the motorcar george is walking away
the car sets off and overtakes him
peppy does not turn round
george dressed differently is drinking in a clandestine bar that has made the effort of putting up a few christmas decorations
george is visibly smashed
a small version of him appears superimposed on the bar dressed as an explorer and discovering the life size version of himself
the big version watches the little version load his rifle
then the little version shoots at the big version but the big version just smiles
little version runs off shot to get help and he comes back with a tribe of african warriors all bearing spears
big version tries to defend himself staggers as he gets to his feet tries to gesture to the barman but he is so drunk that he falls straight backwards without
making the slightest attempt to stop his fall
the africans leap about with joy
georges chauffeur comes into the bar
he motions to the barman who jerks his head in one direction
the chauffeur follows the indication and finds george lying on the floor totally smashed
he slaps him gently around the face a few times in a vain attempt to wake him then lifts him over his shoulder pays the check and leaves
at georges house his chauffeur puts him to bed and hangs his suit carefully before leaving the room
he sees the dog goes over to it and strokes it
they look at each other
we can tell that the chauffeur is worried about george
peppy miller is the guardian angel
its a huge poster on the facade of a movie theater
george goes inside
the auditorium is full
george sits down in the first row
to watch the film he has to look upwards and sees a huge and magnificent peppy rising above him
shes playing a scene with a young actor we recognize its humphrey bogart
hes become a spectator he laughs is absorbed and cries along with the others
coming out of the theater several young people bump into him
they dont recognize him
theres a lot of people milling about so he picks jack up
a woman exclaims an oh
of admiration as though shes recognized george
he smiles modestly but soon realizes that its just because she thinks jack is cute and has come over to stroke him like she would any other dog
she is totally under jacks charm and says to george
title card if only he could talk
george still has the smile on his lips but it has become one of resignation
he looks away as the woman strokes the dog
george is playing zorro
he performs stunt after stunt and the close ups show his devastating smile to its best advantage
in fact its an extract from the mark of zorro with douglas fairbanks into which well insert close ups of jean weve shot ourselves
the zorro sequence is being screened on a wall in georges apartment
george is watching himself slumped in an easy chair
his sluggish attitude and listless air are in sharp contrast with the image of himself projected by the film
then the image jumps and goes white
george gets up still half smashed
his shadow is clearly delineated on the white screen
he sees it looks it up and down and then starts to look at it sideways
title card look what youve become
he carries on shouting at it obviously very annoyed with it
title card you were very nasty
he doesnt even want to look at it anymore
he looks disgusted
suddenly his shadow separates itself from him and moves independently from him
as he shouts at it it lowers its head and doesnt reply
title card you acted very badly
you were thoughtless
he carries on as though its normal until his shadow walks off with its head bowed
he watches it go trying to understand whats happening but its gone and hes still there
he begins to holler
title card come back
come back here right now
totally smashed he starts to violently throw film reels against the wall as he hollers
the cans split open and the film bursts out all over
george is becoming more and more frenzied
the floor is now covered in cans and film
he stops dripping with sweat
worriedly he looks around for a moment
then he strikes a match takes a second to consider what hes about to do and throws the match into the middle of the reels
theres madness in his eyes as he watches the fire take hold
we can see his pleasure at seeing the flames spread
but hes very quickly overrun
the reels burst into flames in an instant and give off lots of smoke
jack is panicking and barks incessantly
suddenly george seems to lose it
he doesnt know what to do anymore and although the fire is spreading quite spectacularly around him he runs to where the reels and films that he has not opened
are and begins throwing them frantically over his shoulder as though hes looking for one in particular
the ever increasing denseness of the smoke however is making the task almost impossible
on the floor below the smoke jack flees the room and runs off while george suffocates but continues to struggle with the cans of reels
the dog comes out of the house and makes a dash for the sidewalk as fast as he can
in the room among the flames and the smoke george now breathless picks one of the reels and tries to turn round
he collapses still holding on to the can
jack spots a cop at a junction
he takes hold of the cops trouser leg with his teeth and tries to pull him towards georges house
the policeman doesnt understand however and pushes it away with his foot
the dog persists and barks but the cop just wants to be left in peace
george is suffocating on the floor
the level of smoke is getting ever lower and is slowly covering his face
jack barks louder and louder
the policeman feels uncomfortable
a woman is watching the scene inquisitively
not knowing what to do the cop motions to the dog to be silent and threatens it with two fingers just like george miming a pistol
jack collapses and plays dead
the cop has no idea whats happened he crouches down and touches the dog to see if its all right
jack wakes up and goes to leave but stops immediately to show the cop he wants to take him with him
the cop still doesnt understand its the woman who tells him what he must do
the cop seems to understand has a moment of doubt and then starts following the dog
jack encourages him to go faster but the cop resists to begin with
little by little though as though realizing the seriousness of the situation he speeds up
more and more until he finally arrives flat out at georges home
the cop sees the smoke coming out of the house
he runs into the smoke
a completely unconscious george overcome by the fumes is dragged out of the fire by the policeman
they come out the house
george is still clutching the reel
a crowd has formed people recognize him
one woman feels sorry for him a man runs for help
george is unconscious
we see peppy on a shoot sitting in a chair with her name on it smoking a cigarette
everyone about her is busy preparing a shot
suddenly an assistant brings her a telephone
she takes the receiver with a smile and listens
her expression tightens a little
she hangs up pensive for a moment
on set the director gestures to his assistant that the shot is ready and they are good to go
the assistant goes towards peppy to let her know but as he gets to where she should be her seat is empty
he looks everywhere for her but she has disappeared
in her car and still in costume she urges her chauffeur to go quick as he can
the car pulls into the hospital courtyard
peppy bursts into the lobby talks to a woman at the desk who directs her with a raised hand that peppy immediately follows
she bounds up the stairs four at a time and comes into a corridor and then to a door through the window of which she sees george lying down
his dog is at the foot of the bed asleep
george is on a drip unconscious and covered in bandages
a doctor is in the room with a nurse
shes anxious but the doctor seems reassuring
title card hes not in any danger now
he just needs to rest
peppy goes up to george
she notices that his burnt hands seem to still be clutching something
in response the doctor shows her the reel of film that sits in a corner of the room
title card he was holding that
it was real hard to pry it away from him
peppy picks up the can
the label is too damaged to be able to read the title of the film
she opens it and unrolls some of the film in front of the window
we see random photograms run by
its the only sequence they ever shot together years before
peppy is moved
without turning round she asks the doctor title card do you think he could come rest up at my place
the doctor nods with a kindly glint in his eye
title card its probably the very best he could have hoped for
an ambulance takes george still unconscious to peppys house
jack is with him
its a large beautiful house very expensive and very hollywood
but its also very inviting
its night time
george is in bed
he opens one eye
then he wakes up and looks around not understanding where he is
jack wakes up and barks wags his tail
a nurse who had been dozing in an armchair facing the bed awakes with a start then goes over to george
she reassures him motions to him not to get upset then slowly leaves the room before running off down the corridor
she knocks at a door then goes back to georges room
peppy is close on her heels
she comes into the room in her nightgown
when he sees her george smiles and she rushes over to the bed and puts her arms tight around him
she is terribly moved but when she releases him from her arms to talk to him she realizes that he has lost consciousness again and so was not sharing the
same special moment as she
she pulls a face afraid she might have done something wrong glances over at the nurse then lays georges head back on his pillow
the next morning peppy brings breakfast into georges room and they eat it together
she laughs talks eats drinks and is as vivacious as he had dreamed she would be all those years before
he looks at her with a smile on his face
then she looks at her watch and realizes she needs to hurry
title card ive got to go
i have to be on set for nine oclock
george smiles kindly at her
she returns the smile but we can tell that maybe reality has just reminded them that she is working and he is not
they exchange a last glance before she leaves the room
george now alone gets up with some difficulty
he picks up a pile of folded clothes from an armchair
its his jacket and pants both half burned
on the floor his shoes are in exactly the same state of disrepair
a little later and alone hes exploring the house
its richly and tastefully decorated highly personal
he goes along a corridor and down a wide stairway
jack begins sniffing outside of one door as though he wants to go inside
george opens the door and goes into the room its a kind of storeroom in which everything is covered up with sheets
he closes the door behind him
the room has a ghostly quality to it
jack sniffs about everywhere
george too seems troubled by the strange pervading atmosphere
his curiosity is spurred by a convoluted object that is covered in a thin cloth
a ray of light surges into the room
the door has opened and standing against the daylight is a maid
title card you should go back to your room sir
george nods with a smile
the maid leaves pretty swiftly we havent seen her face the whole moment seems rather strange
george is intrigued but leaves the room
he has to call jack to him
jack is reluctant to go but finally obeys his master
a screenplay lies on a table
peppy and zimmer are seated either side of the table and are talking animatedly
were on the set we saw the previous day and peppy seems to be trying to convince zimmer of something
she seems to be describing a film poster or the facade of a movie theater shed love to see
he doesnt seem too enthusiastic from the looks of the negative shakes of his head and his apologetic air as he listens to peppy
she finally stops talking and gives him a determined look
zimmer uncomfortable and sorry calmly replies
title card george is a silent movie actor
he belongs to the past
today hes a nobody
as zimmers speaking she removes her accessories and hat
zimmer is so intrigued he stops talking
title card what are you doing
she looks him straight in the eyes and answers title card im stopping work
its him or me
she looks determined
hes looking unsure of himself
he visibly isnt sure hes understood properly
she drives her point home
title card what i mean is its either him and me
or neither of us
zimmer still isnt sure hes understood
he just looks at her
title card im blackmailing you get it
even when shes blackmailing shes still pretty and zimmer looks at her totally at a loss but at the same time its obvious that hes going to back down
the people around them are listening in on their conversation and seem to be waiting for his decision
theres an element of deja vu to the situation and zimmer who already backed down a few years before gives in
title card and why not
she smiles at him picks up the screenplay with delight and leaves
as he moves away she whistles at him
he turns round and she vigorously blows him a kiss
the screenplay lies on the front seat of a car
the camera pulls back its clifton who is in the driving seat
george is lying in bed when his former chauffeur comes in
at first hes delighted to see him but this turns into astonishment and he seems to ask the man a question
the chauffeur answers title card i work for miss miller now
george visibly doesnt know what to think and although he remains pleasant becomes somewhat reserved
its as though something has come between them
the chauffeur places the screenplay on the bedside table
george seems to greet it with mistrust certainly not with enthusiasm
the chauffeur also has a box of cakes with him that he puts on a plate for george
george doesnt want any its all too much
before he leaves the chauffeur overcomes his habitual reserve for the first time and says to george title card shes been good to you
shes always looked out for you
the chauffeur leaves without trying to convince george further as the other looks on full of pride and doubt
from the window we see the chauffeur get into the car and drive off
we recognize the car as being the one that belonged to george
at the window george watches him leave
then he seems to have an idea or more exactly an intuition
george goes into the room thats full of sheets
he goes straight over to the object with the bizarre shape and lifts up the sheet
underneath he finds his former objet dart the three monkeys hear no evil speak no evil and see no evil
he thinks for a moment then pulls of another sheet to reveal a piece of furniture
once again its a piece that used to belong to him and we recognize it from having seen it at the auction room
after taking off several other sheets george realizes that she bought everything he had put up for sale furniture paintings objets dart souvenirs etc
he rips off sheets one after the other and the objects appear even down to his suits and tuxedos
he continues and discovers the painting depicting him in a tux waving and smiling
george looks stunned at the sight of himself looking so full of life
hes interrupted by the same ray of light which surges into the room once more
this time at the door are the butler and the maid
george walks towards them when he sees them
the closer he gets to them however the more his expression tightens
we realize that the butler is none other than the distinguished looking man who purchased everything at the auction and that the maid is the woman who was bidding against
him to raise the sale prices
george is looking at them as he leaves the room
he has recognized them but doesnt say anything to them
he walks off still shocked by what hes just realized
he finishes putting on his burnt suit in his room and leaves
he goes down the stairs and flees the house
george is in the street wearing his burnt suit and damaged shoes
he is shirtless
with jack by his side he walks along the sidewalk
there are a few other people walking along
about twenty yards ahead of him a man is begging
he holds out his hand to passers by
george approaches and when there are no other passers by between him and george the beggar glances at him and lowers his hand
he doesnt raise it as george approaches
george stops in front of him and looks at him but the beggar motions to him to scram
george continues on his way
for that moment at least he has become one of them
he buttons up the collar of his suit in an attempt to hide the fact that he doesnt have a shirt then heads off and loses himself in the crowd
some distance later he stops to check his reflection in a shop window
the image he sees is that of a bum
its even more striking because the in the window there is a young male mannequin wearing a tux top hat and white scarf
the image of the mannequin and that of george are superimposed
a cop comes up to george and begins talking to him in a friendly manner
he speaks but we dont know what about
there is not title card
george visibly has no idea what the cop is talking about
the cop seems to be talking about nothing important just chatting
he talks and talks
george doesnt understand what hes saying and doesnt understand why hes talking to him
title card what did you say
the cop smiles carries on talking then stops
he thinks hes talking to a madman
he doesnt persist merely sizes george up and once hes decided that hes harmless the cop walks off
george totally bewildered by the incident seems to lose his grip on himself a little more
peppy gets home in the evening arms laden with flowers
she quickly goes up the stairs and into georges bedroom
hes not there
she looks for him but cant find him
the maid says that he has left
she drops the flowers
george goes into his house that has been disfigured by the fire
the flames have changed everything and the atmosphere here again seems ghostly and sad
george sits down in an armchair in the darkness
jack sits down facing him
he wags his tail and it thumps on the ground
in the room with all the sheets peppy is with the maid
the maid seems to be telling her what happened with george how he removed all the sheets etc
peppy listens with an inscrutable expression on her face
then suddenly overcome by a terrible thought she rushes outside
she runs out of the house and over to the car but the chauffeur isnt there
she honks the horn to call him but theres no response
she honks the horn again then not wanting to wait any longer and seeing the keys on the dashboard she gets behind the wheel starts the engine and pulls off
in a series of kangaroo hops
its obvious that she doesnt know how to drive all that well but still goes at full speed more or less successfully
just as she passes through the gate the chauffeur turns up
he sees her drive away
peppy is driving as fast as she can through town but shes pretty reckless and almost causes an accident
outside georges house the wind is slamming one of the shutters with the regularity of a metronome
george takes a gulp of liquor then puts down the glass opens a cardboard box and takes out a pistol that he places on the table in front of him
he picks up the glass for another gulp
jack doesnt like what he sees
as for peppy shes speeding along totally ignoring even the most basic of road safety requirements
george puts down his glass and picks up the pistol
jack isnt happy at all
he barks and bites georges trouser leg pulling on it
peppy speeding along
george puts the pistol into his mouth
jack is barking like mad
george still in the same position closes his eyes
title card bang
george is in the same position
he still has the pistol in his mouth
visibly hes heard a bang from outside because he takes the pistol out of his mouth and looks out the window
outside we see peppys car has rammed into the gate and is still shuddering
peppy didnt brake in time but she doesnt care
she jumps out the car and runs into the house
she rushes into the living room and stops for a moment to look at george
george awkwardly tries to hide the pistol behind him
she bursts into tears
title card i feel so awful
i only wanted to help you
to take care of you
he seems to reply that no its not her fault shes got nothing to feel bad about
he opens his arms towards her still holding the pistol and the gun fires itself
fortunately no one is hurt but the incident makes peppy laugh and between sobs and gasps of laughter she throws herself into georges arms
they hug for a long time
peppy says into his ear title card youve got so much that no one else has
and into her ear george replies title card no im nothing but a shadow
no good for anything but silence
peppy doesnt reply
she just holds him tighter still and closes her eyes
jack is sitting close by watching them and wagging his tail
outside the shutter is still slamming and the car is still shuddering
peppy opens her eyes
visibly shes had an idea
jack wags his tail and thumps it on the ground
the shutter slams
the car shudders
peppy smiles at george
title card i know what you have that no one else does
peppy moves away from george and motions to him to listen
the shutter slams
jacks tail thumps
the car shudders
peppy does a few tap steps
george doesnt understand
peppy starts again with a beaming smile waiting for his response
george does a few tap steps himself basic ones without any great enthusiasm
she smiles at him and does a few more complex steps that are a lot livelier
he smiles back finally understanding the golden gift that he has in his feet
he looks at peppy lovingly with a beaming smile on his face
music suddenly begins to play and we see feet dancing in another decor
except that from now on we actually hear the sound of the tap steps
we pull back to find peppy and george in zimmers office
theyre dancing for him
little by little zimmer is convinced by them and when they finish their demonstration he has a broad smile on his face
we find peppy and george on a film set still dancing
the piece of jazz they are dancing to has gone so crazy that now everyone wants to get up and dance
they are dancing a tap number facing the camera in a decor representing a stylized new york
the choreography is incredible in the grand style of the old hollywood musicals and they finish with a knee slide that brings them right up to us with big smiles
on their faces
the music stops on a powerful blast from the brass instruments that leaves everyone bursting with energy
in the ensuing silence peppy and george stay exactly where they were facing the camera with the smile stuck on their faces
it goes on for a little too long they are out of breath
then they look at someone off shot
they are facing a film crew from their era of course
the director smiles
zimmer sitting next to him seems ecstatic
the director speaks and we hear what he says
zimmer has both his thumbs up
the director says to peppy and george
george laughs and replies and we hear him too
the end the credits run while peppy and george go back to their positions
the camera ours pulls back and into frame come all the technicians who are setting up the shot the hair make up and costume people for continuity the camera coming
into position the director coming over to say a few words to the star couple in short the shot being prepared for another take
and when everyone is in position the director speaks into his megaphone and we hear ok camera
fade to black and the music picks up again for the end of the credit sequence
