ron bass third draft rewrite february previous drafts by laura jones beth henley glaring fluorescence trash overflowing with cheap detergent boxes empty coke machine flashing all lights orange
only two dryers are humming
its very late
keep panning to
a wiry gimlet eyed woman furtively removing crumpled newspapers from a dryer
she flattens and folds them meticulously her glance darting angrily everywhere
top secret mission
a natty little black man
partridge has spread a late supper on a neat cloth atop a dryer
small cold fowl
brie baguette olives
bottle of red
an air of competence of indomitable upbeatness
he ignores the spy dressed as bag lady as if she were normal
more curious about
a hulking rumpled figure scrutinizing help wanted ads as if cramming for lifes midterm exam
circles one slowly
set out on quoyles dryer are one snickers bar and four empty snickers wrappers
his version of cold supper
he reaches for the candy but seeing its the last one he
goes to the candy machine
drops in his cents hits the button
the snickers starts to fall but gets caught in the mechanism at the last moment
quoyle blinks dully
one more retelling of the story of his life
he bangs the machine half heartedly
shakes it with his shambling strength
pounds the coin return button
he empties his pocket
studies the results
and without so much as a sigh
he ambles back to his dryer
starts to unwrap the last snickers
partridge taking this all in
but mata hari of the neat newspapers goes to the candy machine kicks it violently
out fall the snickers and the cents
she scoops up both turns in a single motion to
glare death at the enemy
quoyle opens his mouth to comment
resumes unwrapping his supper as
his dryer stops
he pops it open
suddenly yanks a tangle of graying shirts out onto the grimy floor to reveal they have been
stained streaky blue by a cheap pen quietly melting amid the pile
this slips beneath even quoyles expectation level
the big soft face is pitifully yes even adorably devastated
quoyle a murmur ruined
and to the bystander
this seems a comment on more than shirts
partridge softly nah
rub the ink with hot salt and talcum powder
quoyles head whips around
as if he thought he was alone
if youre shocked when someone aims kindness your way
that oughta tell you somethin about yourself
watches the little guys undemanding smile
just staring then again
if youre that kinda guy
and put a cuppa bleach in next time through
as quoyle gazes at his benefactor the woman sneaks up snatches his help wanted ads
races them over to her dryer
as the boys watch she shoves them in starts the machine with quoyles coins and glares fiercely back at us
a mother bear protecting her cubs
holds out his hand
quoyle glances at the little mans cold fowl supper
its my name
shabby one floor newspaper
old equipment listless personnel stale you can smell from here
only guy working is partridge who is laying out the front page and glances up to see across the floor
quoyle enter in his best suit
it is also his worst suit
partridge points to the only enclosed office and gives his buddy a hearty thumbs up
quoyle nods his smile a rictus his eyes a glaze of panic
we see now that he is chewing somehow
on the way into the office he snags a doughnut from a paper plate by the coffee
ed punch managing editor looks up from a reverie with a startled expression
he wears really thick glasses which magnify his eyes giving him a frightening aspect
from the rear we see quoyle can barely squeeze himself into the chair
i dont like that
all the change spills out of quoyles pockets and clatters onto the wood floor rolling interminably as quoyle fidgets
partridge says youre not as dumb as you look
reverse angle now to see quoyles face
the neat moustache of powdered sugar
how could i be
and takes a healthy bite from whats left of the doughnut
anyway thats why im takin a chance on you
partridge said hed re write whatever of your stuff
quoyle nods dumbly
were a family paper
upbeat stories with a community slant
self help stuff are you a break fast alcoholic
guide to getting dumped
quoyle nods bigger
like he gets it
punch shoves an antique tape recorder across the table
city planning board meeting at two thirty
three hunnerd words max
sink or swim
hold on quoyles eyes
quoyle as a fat kid in a baggy bathing suit being savagely pummeled by his vicious older brother
i think my brother said that once
being pulled off the sniveling quoyle by a rough hairy man with dead eyes
maybe it was my father
quoyles father hauls him off the deck and in a single motion flings him into the pool
sink or swim pig butt
watches the thrashing with mild contempt
turns away before quoyle simply sinks beneath the surface
im not a water person
the empty room a haven of dust motes floating in sickly fluor escence
quoyle sits across the desk gazing with endearing fearfulness as partridge turns page after page
see three hunnerd words would be like one page
oh fifteen sixteen
so we should cut it
partridge does glance up on that
gonna have to
or you could tie me in a sack throw me in the river
tell the police you thought it was oddly wrapped lard
might be quicker
nobody has to
quoyle pulls a big glass jar from a paper sack
sets it on the desk
does your wife like special pickles
theyre fine with cold cuts
partridge looks at the cornichons
they look expensive
come by for supper tomorrow
well find out
sausages on the bbq interesting colors and sizes
a huge hand delicately places cut up pieces of quail on the grill
it is quoyle trusted paying attention
mercalia a slim black woman with fiery eyes and an enticing smile hands him a glass of white wine and
goes to slip her arm around partridge
he watches quoyles concentration approvingly
shares a smile with his sexy wife
and raps a knife on his glass
quoyle looks up with innocent eyes
which makes partridge hesitate
got you this
mercalia takes out the package
wrapped in tissue a neat ribbon
she hands it to quoyle and leans up to kiss his cheek
quoyle looks down at it dumbfounded
an anniversary present
anniversary of our friendship
sweet and slightly confused
seven and a half month anniversary
he starts to unwrap
a nice one
he is overwhelmed but still uncomprehending
its because were happy
and steals a glance at her husband
quoyle big grin youre havin a baby
that stops partridges face
no more stalling
mercalia and me are movin
quoyle so pole axed he cant even lose the smile
it just turns stupid and transparent
his friend swallows
you know shes been learnin to drive a rig
she got the oakland to new orleans run
im gonna make her smoked duck sandwiches for the road
i can edit copy anywhere
quoyle nodding slowly smile still there
i guess ycan
partridge sees that its a death blow
mercalia looks at her feet
loves all that counts
its the engine of life
as if parting advice
as if quoyle should file that away
so quoyle nods some more
as if he will
stay in touch
on this quoyles smile deserts him
so partridge reaches out his hand
quoyle paralyzed then takes it
close on their handclasp and dissolve to
a slender feminine hand
buried in quoyles
petal bear mr
pan up to see her
tiny twitchy moist ringlets
a gray eyed predator
she looks around at the milling suits and their name tags
as if they were alternatives
do you hate this shit or what
quoyle transfixed by her slight form in its loose but clingy wrapping
the smile that sees him again and flickers
what do you think
you want to marry me dont you
she laughs as if at some off color response
runs hot fingers up his arm leaning to his face
buy me a drink somewhere its seven thirty
i think im going to fuck you by ten
what do you think of that
she laughs again
bright like whiskey music
you are quite
petal naked in near darkness moves with authority toward the massive lumpy creature nearly overflowing his bed
draws the covers back
i won the lottery
climbs on the lithe move of a leopardess
it was pretty much like that for a month
petal riding in silhouette with great violent swoops
close on his face his eyes
somewhere in there
we got married
smoke and bodies
quoyle alone carrying his sloshing beer apologies unheard toward
after that i had to follow her to see her
the back of petal talking to a big guy in a shiny suit
which i know was wrong of me
close enough to hear
what do you think
you want to marry me dont you
hold on quoyles face
the lovelight has never left
it shines through the shock
as if in apology
she didnt know she was pregnant
one year old bunny is screaming in a rickety crib festooned with mobiles and bright toys
hear quoyle pounding in
he reaches to lift her
way up starts running around the faded little parlor making cheerful airplane noises as he dives and swoops the shrieking kid until he
gives her a kiss which doesnt put a dent in the screaming and flops her down on the diaper table
she is screaming louder
he is fumbling with the diaper the baby wipes getting a wad of ten or so at once
the phone rings
he runs off
runs back lifts bunny diaper dangling from the tape stuck to her skin and snatches up the phone hoping with everything in him that its
how do you make an alabama slammer
he takes a breath
can hear the noise of a rowdy spot
country juke box
where are y
hence the question
has stopped screaming
ill make you one
thats a swell idea
now go look on top of the fridge where i keep the mr
what should he do
he sets bunny carefully on the floor
she starts screaming again and he lifts her quick cuddles her
lopes off leaving the phone on the floor
races back in with the mr
boston a bag of pork rinds and a pacifier
something for everyone
as he flips the pages he murmurs into the phone
except for being thirsty
she laughs almost friendly
im busy ill see y
quoyle reads ounce southern comfort ounce sloe gin
ounce triple sec
three ounces o
the buzz of her disconnect
he glances down at bunny working the pacifier
murmurs to the receiver
ill tell bunny you miss her
hang up the phone
kiss a baby
eat a pork rind
as he gazes down on bunny we push into her face and match dissolve to
an ecu of bunny now six years old asleep in the flickering blue light of a nearly mute tv
apparently she was watching sportscenter
pan the darkened shoebox room
toys everywhere in a clutter
a pile of used barbies limbs jutting in all directions waiting for a mass grave
back to bunny to see
she sleeps in her fathers lap
his chin resting on her head an industrial size bag of cookies handy
somewhere a door opens
quoyle gently lays bunny on her bed and lurches into the hall to see petal disappearing into her bedroom and he hurries to stop the door before it slams in
when she turns she is wasted feral and somehow as sexy as ever
her laser glare
what the fuck do you want
she tears off her jacket revealing that she has left her shirt somewhere and is down to her bra
she stalks toward him
straight to the doorway
with what you got down there youll do fine
shakes his head
only thing can work here
tears of shock pool in his eyes
i knew we had our problems
but i never thought id hear that word
she shivers with disgust
walks around in a frustrated circle
back to his face
are you sure
what does a girl have to do
the tears are on his face
she flashes her hardest look
her slender fingers reach out
wipe his face not as roughly as she might have intended
your funeral pussy
and closes the door quietly but firmly
in his face
he stares at it
his lips part
but no sound comes
instead he walks the few steps to bunnys room to find her
sitting on the edge of her bed
no question she heard it all
so quoyle smiles
he reaches to the top of her battered armoire
his eyes damp but dancing for his daughter
a box of chocolates
he sits on the floor
opens the lid like buried treasure
she comes to cuddle in his lap
he feeds her one
she feeds him one
theyve done this before
as they chew
i knew if i could take it
in the end
it would all work out
everyone trooping back from lunch twos and threes
quoyle last alone still stuffing down a snack cake as he heads for the coffee pot
theres one answering machine for everybody here glowing a red number
someone hits it and everybody shuts up a beat to see if they got lucky
lila its daniel
lila doesnt even bother to blush
a shrug is plenty
quoyle this is your father
dickys machine is full
your home ones broke
its time for your mother and i to go
instructions about the undertaker
on the dining room table
eyes are sneaking over now
lots of them
youll have to make your own way
nobody gave me nuthin
other men woulda give up turned to bums
i sweated wheeled barrows of sand went without so you and yer brother could have advantages
not that you did much with your chances
everybody just openly staring now
quoyles snack cake and coffee frozen in mid air
hasnt been much of a life
tell dicky and my sister agnis hamm
her numbers on the dining room ta
that was your final message
sounded that way
despite the hateful coarseness of this message quoyle is deeply moved
lips pursed inward to stem tears
in the silence
fat guy trying were they sick or something
quoyle stares into distance
somewhere feet shuffle
brain tumor and liver cancer
afterthought one apiece
fat gal sad for him thats rough
he nods it is that
wanders on over to his desk
theyre still watching but he doesnt seem to notice
turns his ratty rolodex with solemn slowness
not to dishonor the moment
finds the number dials
winces at the harshness of the voice he hears
its mom and poppa
he cant say any more
turns out he doesnt need to
snorts jeez they did it
i never thought hed find the fucking guts
quoyle licks his lips
his eyes puddling now
for the funeral i thou
you think id go pay that prick respects
you got me confused with you
quoyle shakes his head once
that confused he isnt
quoyle quietly well
momll be there too
they leave us anything ythink
dont see how
spent their savings on the doctors
i hadda send some grocery mon
well see thats why he did it
i mean think how it felt
taking from you
they are watching him replace the receiver in its cradle
stumble slightly as he makes his way toward
punch looks up startled at quoyles entrance
his oversized glasses seem to magnify his eyes more than ever
i gotta drive down to my parents place
ill be back friday
a full beat
take yer time
i gotta let you go
quoyles eyes sharpen
in what sense do you m
as in canned
once again life slips beneath even quoyles expectations
quoyle a little dazed uh
would next week be better
punch sighs i got the summer interns comin next week
theyre free and theyre smart
gotta do somethin to fight this slump
but dont worry
yer not the only one
should i finish the sawmill piece
quoyle enters carrying a spray of violets
hear springer turned up loud
he goes to the parlor to find
moosup the babysitter smoking and swigging a pepsi
she is mean ugly with flesh hanging beneath her arms
she stares at him the flowers
moosup dry mr
you shouldnt have
quoyle taking her literally theyre for petal mrs
i got something to tell her
well that may take awhile
she came in at one packed like crazy
said she was movin to florida with the guy in the red geo
you know the one
he knows the one
she says you gotta pay my wages for the sittin
seven weeks comes to
preciate a check right n
he is heading toward the hall
she took bunny with her
that stops him
thats the last thing shed ev
she was real clear about my check
its no fun workin if you dont get paid
he tears out down the hall into bunnys room
no more tangled pile of barbies
he surveys the wreckage of his life
at least she took her toys
wanted her to be happy
he staggers out of the room down the hall
i aint got all day here
into the kitchen
lifts the receiver
quoyle quietly yes
i need to report a kidnapping
and straightens his spine
just a little
q u o y l
no y then l e
yeh its my kid
hes still holding the violets
he notices this
sets them down almost tenderly in the sink
quoyle alone in absolute darkness
bumping around the house
theres a large bag of something in one hand maybe m ms
but hes not eating
just murmuring to himself
quoyle moving in his parents cluttered parlor like a man underwater
a room as drab as neglected as brooklyn through the window
he stands at a shelf now staring at a row of framed photos
a boy of bundled for winter stands by a frozen pond
stocky sullen something unpleasant in the narrow eyes
next to him not touching a girl big for
flat gaze like somethings dead or hidden
quoyle walks to the table
a cardboard box has been filled with mementos
a slip of paper agnis hamm a telephone number
the phone is ringing now
quoyle staring at the paper
finally lifts the phone breathes an absent greeting and
is this mr
quoyle weary hes not here
this is lt
amos figg of the mockingburg new york police
could you have him call me when he ret
hes passed on
beat you said mockingb
were a small town upstate
im actually trying to reach his son
he allegedly went down to his parents place two days ago
not in the mood
are you a detective lieutenant
well as youve probably deduced i am his son
cause im at his place
theres no need for that tone sir
im calling with urgent news
and says no more
we can feel quoyles heart beating from here
hesitant you want the good news
or the bad news
would be an understatement
your daughter bunny was sold by your wife to a child pornographer
but shes fine
we got her
and the doc says she wasnt touched
if you catch my drift
a dingy kitchen scuzzier than we could even have guessed
bunny in her underpants sliding merrily on a floor made slippery with dish detergent
pan past the video camera on its tripod to the pornographer at the window also in his underpants screaming into a cordless phone
back to quoyle
his heart must have started again because he is able to say
the good n
a riverbank somewhere high above swiftly flowing water
police and bystanders gathered
a winch reaching its chain into the depths
your wife was in a red geo which went through a guardrail over the chesapeake bay bridge
here comes part of the geo
streaming water and mud
they were doin in a fog
the car was cut in half by the impact with the rail
her male companions body floated up downstream
back to the horrified husband
waiting in silence
may never find the body
but she was mercifully killed on impact without a doubt
they found her shoes under the dash and her
trousers for some reas
that dont mean for sure she w
and her purse
with the nine large
tears finally force their way through the shock
as he realizes
quoyle a murmur yeh
if she was alive
dont guess shed a left that
quoyle moving his bulk fast down a corridor a uniformed cop almost skipping alongside to keep up watching quoyle like a hawk all the way to
the threadbare common room
kids playing arguing sleeping staring at an antique tv
quoyle goes through them all cop doggedly in his wake and sinks to his knees beside
i cant do this
bunny on the ratty sofa legs dangling holding out a vintage gameboy
she wears clean clothes freshly washed hair and a comfortable smile
quoyle very soft me neither
and kisses her lightly on the lips
quoyle softer still hi
she kisses him back much harder on the mouth
the lopsided grin of a practicing imp
that for me
we hadnt seen them hidden beside his leg
a bunch of daisies
he gives them to her
like her best beau
wheres our candy
in the store
that way youve got the whole selection
give us a minute
bunny doesnt understand
i mean him
pull back to the cop staring down on them from point blank range
he doesnt move
quoyle looks up with an easy smile that says hed just as soon tear all the arms and legs off and sweat the consequences later
the cop backs well off
he can take a hint
petal went to florida
shell be back soon
he looks in her eyes
shakes his head
she had an accident
so do you
he nods i do
tenderly pulls a strand of her hair aside
there was a car crash sweetie
and they found
you know the body
of her friend
his big hand has wrapped around one of hers
she doesnt seem to mind
their faces so close
petal cant come back shes dead
you know dead
like the turtle
she drills his eyes
calm as a moose
we found the turtle
and they found nestor
did you find petal
he shakes his head
you never do
but she always comes back
and leans her forehead
to rest against his
quoyle stumbling toward the front door drawing his robe around him
squinting through the peephole
opening the door to reveal
nephew im your aunt
tall and rawboned and
a rugged maybe even handsome face set with ice blue eyes
calm slightly scary eyes that drift to his robe
its nine oclock
he is completely off balance here
no bunny and i like to
uh early to bed earl
losin your wife your folks and your jobd depress anybody
its a wonder you dont sleep all day
not that she seems to approve
not at all
his eyes now drift to the large well used suitcases dangling from her powerful hands
thought id stay a day or two
give you some relief with th
the mouth doesnt smile
but the eyes crinkle slightly toward
who has crept out in her jammies
hugging a sack of pepperidge farm cookies like it was a teddy
agnis to bunny you like blue dogs named warren
the little girl nods
as if she certainly does
i got one in the car
in the far corner of the room bunny plays with warren a sweet ugly dog
toothless and undeniably blue
i never knew her really
see him now sipping his tea
wallowing in the detritus of his emotions
but she was driven by terrible forces no one could understand
she was a locked door
even to me
agnis in the good chair
teacup on her ample lap
assessing a photo on the end table petals arctic eyes rigidly seductive pose
the snapshot enshrined by a neighboring votive rose in its jelly jar glass
so she wasnt just a bitch in high heels
quoyles eyes cut instinctively toward his daughter her innocence protected by distance and absorption with warrens passivity
she mighta heard worse from her momma
im only guessin
some people probably thought petal was bad clear through
are a cynical lot
i think she just couldnt get enough love
agnis unblinking eyes
i think the evidence
is on your side
the eyes study him
dissect him even
im headed north nephew to where our family comes from in newfoundland
thought id never go back
but the older yget
clucks her tongue
theres a pull
becomes an ache
as if where your people started held a purpose for you
like youre a piece in a puzzle
not a smile
a softening of timbre a flicker behind the eye
lookin for where yfit
lifts her cup
takes a sip
his eyes have narrowed in a burlesque of suspicion
in what sense do you m
you need to come nephew
just like that
nothin here but hurt
you got to start fresh everythins gone
the tripll clear your head
be educational for the squirt
teach ya the worlds still spinnin outside this toxic slice ohades
and who knows
tilts her head
they must have a newspaper up there
somebodys gotta write it
he just stares
the blankest of the blank
tell the truth id appreciate the company
you two are pretty much my family
his face softens
hadnt thought of it that way
and seeing this
a pot ocoffee would hit the spot
drop owhiskey would fit nice in it
and when he does
which ones my brother
she looks at two urns on the mantle
and thats poppa
the name of the funeral home tastefully stenciled
he clears his throat
those are temporary
and maybe a sweet
quoyle nods glad to serve
heads off to the kitchen
agnis looks at bunny and warren
she needs to go outside
i know why
she runs out the dog trotting after
agnis pulls something from her large carpetbag purse
it is an oversized ziploc bag
her brothers urn
she removes the lid
turns the huge ziploc upside down to cover the urn
then in one deft movement
upends the urn a cascade of ash tumbling into the ziploc
sets it to one side
then from her purse
another ziploc already filled with replacement ashes
she pours just enough into the urn
that should do it
stashes the rest back in her purse
turns now to lift
the ziploc with her brothers remains
stares at it
think hamlet with yorricks skull
what say guy
eyes flat and neutral
just a thought
a world of fog and reflected high beams
big rig pulls over and petal climbs up and in her short red dress fluttering about her thighs
the truck is roaring heedlessly through dense cloud
the driver is gross and bald snot suspended from his nostrils
he lets go of the wheel to run his hairy hands under petals dress while through the shotgun window we see
quoyle flying along outside like a superhero
except he is shocked bug eyed by the tableau
the disgusting driver buries his face in petals hair she throws her head back laughing and the driver becomes quoyles father quoyle silently shrieking outside the window and smash cut
quoyle blinking awake on the deck of a pitching ferry
fog and cliff and the raw atlantic
and soaring alongside an amazing number of maritime birds
the gulls and terns seeming to stare quoyle in the eye as they glide past
maybe they prompted his dream
they draft off our air currents its quite premeditated
she stands at the rail
smoking despite the wind
they actually know the ferry schedule
show up on time bettern the newfies
he smiles a seasick smile
lurches from his bolted down chair to join her
she nods back toward
bunny through the glass window snuggled with warren feeding the dog french fries
image of msister feeny
shes married to a falconer in arabia now
has to wear a black thing over her face
like the falcon
she stares in his eyes
yes like the falcon
they are growing on each other in a companionable way
to be with family
it is nice
specially big shots
who can land a job with one phone call
his smile changes color
a quiet pride in the modest
well that was my friend partridge
made the call
and its just an interview
when quoyle looks back in at bunny he sees she is staring off at something with full attention
he follows her gaze to
a honey haired mother with her small boy snuggled in her lap
she is feeding him an ice cream bar with evident tenderness
and though the childs face is blissfully vacant she murmurs to him with serious intent
quoyle driving a winding rutted road high above the coastline
cracked cliffs in volcanic glazes
long abandoned settlements jutting from raw granite
icebergs on the horizon above the rumpled creased fabric of a brilliant blue sea
on the map here
named after us
it all seems at once awe inspiring frighteningly lonely
and hostile as hell
the car pulls up in a shroud of mist
our family climbs out stares into what seems the center of a dense cloud until
the fog lifts
and like a ghost a green house appears
then appears again
this time to stay
agnis bottomless pride i was born here
the green makes me hurl
warren whimpers her too
the cloud lifts further and we see the house stands alone on a rocky point
the bay roils far below
half the window panes are gone
holes in the roof paint flaking everywhere
lonely and scary as any haunted house
and look at that roofline straight as a ruler
quoyle looks at her
looks at the house
looks at her
take it easy
floor mighta fallen into the cellar
agnis laughs not likely
there is no cellar
no foundation neither
she takes bunnys squirming hand and starts toward the house as if crossing jordan
agnis calling back the whole things lashed with cable to iron rings set in the rock
he just stands there
sees the cables now the rings
quoyle calling out uh
why would they do th
agnis calling back long story
apparently a private one too
inside the dank corroding place
we can feel all years of abandonment
the door flies open
quoyle with his tire iron steps aside and
agnis drags bunny inside
the wind shrieking low through openings like proper spirits
even this bold child is frightened
so agnis leans to murmur
up those stairs aunt pinkie slept
so fat she couldnt get down to her chamber pot
wanna see if shes still there
asked as a serious question
agnis marching through like macarthur reclaiming the philippines
room after rough hewn spacious room light spiking through a thousand roof holes in assorted shapes
too late to drive that road back round the bay
well camp in here tonight
be right as rain
quoyle looks down to his daughter
who nods as if that were a perfectly natural suggestion
which ones petals room
ill sleep there
close on bunnys sleeping face
push into her closed eyes and fade to
a window unearthly tendrils of fog drifting past in moonglow wisps
suddenly a face appears an animal
wolf or more likely dog
it stares in at us is fleetingly joined by a grizzled human ghost eyes flashing crazy and
gone in mist
rear angle of quoyle and bunny each rolled over onto one side asleep in their sleeping bags
his arm across her protectively
hers across warren who sleeps curled to her chest
pan up to
only the shimmer of cloud like mist
close on quoyle stirring at the end of sleep
his eyes flutter open
he is alone
front hallway quoyles bulk pounding toward us boots in his hand
the front door ajar
and at the threshold in a decorous semi circle six naked barbies
legs spread wide for balance
each staring out the doorway to where
bunny sits on the cold ground
making some craft project with great care
quoyle can breathe again shes safe
ambles out crouches beside her
she keeps working
almost eerie concentration
he sees now that she is weaving a loop of dandelion stems connected by aluminum pop tops
he leans down
kisses her head
is that a belt or a crown
that concerns him
the intensity of her focus
he notices now the soda and beer cans with their tops popped
lined up in a row
he lifts one liquid sloshes out
sodas get flat withou
this is important
she wont look up
he glances back to the doorway
that why the barbies are watching
theyre being nice and patient
they must be chilly tho
should i get their clo
they look better this way
they have great bodies
he looks back
holds up one of the heavy boots hes carrying
it has a thick blue shoelace
sticks that one in front of her face
she looks up to him
tugs on the shoelace which she now wears as a necklace
i need it
i look good in blue
quoyle smiles well
i look good in shoes
sees now what she has tugged from inside her shirt
the shoelace necklace holds a dull metal key as a pendant
i was lookin for that all over our old place
the landlady s
i need it
he takes that in
the urgency of it
she is staring in his eyes
so he grins
you had quite the heavy morning
take the rest of the day off
she doesnt smile back
returns to her work
he looks out by the cliff to see agnis staring across the bay warren sitting at her side
he pulls on his boots
gets to his feet
be right back and well start talking breakf
bunny not looking up watch out for the dog
he looks across the ground toward old warren
yeh her farts are pretty scary
the white one
now their eyes meet
matter of fact
the white dog with the big teeth and the red eyes
the skinny ghost owns him
they came last night
he draws a breath
i didnt dream em dont say i did
he thinks this over
i was gonna say
ill keep my eyes peeled
and makes a funny gesture like peeling his eyeballs
she goes back to work
his eyes linger
then he heads off toward the cliff
when he gets there
agnis staring across the bay ill get us a carpenter
fix the place up in no time
well find a rooming house til th
be cheaper to build a new one
on the riviera even
now she looks at him
her flat bottomless eyes
only i werent born
on the riviera
he nods humbly dumbly
she points off across the water
an actual town
flour sack cove
what times your interview at that paper
the drives a bitch
well buy us a boat
he tries a smile
a water person
agnis dead straight a boat
thats the ticket
his grin hardens
just enough to say that on this issue maybe even she cant push him
he turns around
starts back toward his daughter
not a water person
quoyle driving alone in his best suit
which is also his worst suit
which is also the suit he wore to interview ed punch years ago
around a curve to see ahead
rear angle of a tall woman holding the hand of a child as they walk in their slickers through the downpour
as he passes them they turn and
the woman is petal
the child is bunny
they both stick their tongues out at him
looking in the rear view
the woman is lovely and no longer petal
the child is a boy with a slack face and warm smile
surprisingly the same mother and son that bunny watched on the ferry
someone found a pretty wife
still staring in the mirror
the receding figures small against the rain
someone always does
quoyle pulls up to a ramshackle place its sign the gammy bird over a painted quacking duck
as he climbs out he hears shouting from inside
a door opens and
a crab iike figure scuttles out jumps in a toyota truck turns the key
kills the engine
he looks out at quoyle standing in whats left of the rain
climbs back out
as you can see sometimes ycant get away
im tert x
card the bloody so called managing editor copyeditor rewrite man mechanicals ad makeup department mail and distribution chief and snow shoveler
more of a leering rictus than an actual smile
tert card is aging balding potbellied over a once rawboned frame
his face looks like cottage cheese clawed with a fork
he scratches his balls with a rough hewn hand
he is never happy
and you are either a big advertiser come to buy a four page spread to push your warehouse of left footed japanese boots
are the breathlessly awaited quoyle
thatd be me
the second one
card rakes his privates once more and offers the same hand in dubious greeting
quoyle takes it
have to do without the ultimate cheese ywill
jack buggit is up at the house having charms said over his scrawny chest to clear out that impressive accumulation of phlegm hes been hawking all week
claps a mirthless hand on quoyles back leading him into
makes the mockingburg record look like the washington post
only two employees at their vintage desks
card points as he bellows
now theres billy pretty
hes something of a landmark and an old fish dog
billy pretty is wizened and wiry pushing
a tiny energetic creature with well weathered hide watering crystal blue eyes and a slanted smile
he waves a bony hand
billy does the home news page
poems baby photos household tips and a gossip column under the byline of junior sugg that is pretty much straight libel
that pretty much covers it
he writes the only stuff anybody actually reads
little salute from the managing editor
if card likes anybody he likes billy
and he doesnt
now this miserable ugly brit is b
imagines hes the foreign news chief
steals every story off that foul shortwave radio and rewrites it in limey prose
nutbeem smiling which bloody card rewrites in a mystical tongue most charitably referenced as an unacquireable taste
nutbeem is and gangly
buttery hair swept behind ample ears
a thin moustache a bounteous bowtie a ratty pullover
he opens a file folder
gives quoyle a piercing meaningful glance
mine burmese sawmill owners and the rangoon development corporation met in tokyo tuesday to consider a joint approach to marketing tropical hardwoods
turns the page
cards rewrite burnoosed sawbill awnings and the ranger devotional competition met wednesday near tokyo to mark up local hairwood
its shorter and i got tokyo right
now whats funnier quoyle
my writing style or the fantasy that any newfie would read that moosepuckey in the first pia
quoyle to nutbeem howd the meeting go
did they agree on a joint marketing approach
of a beautiful friendship
nutbeem gentle smile still in progress old bean
one can only hope
card who likes no one
doesnt like quoyle too
theres your miserable desk quoyle
weve got no idea what yer sposed to do
jack buggit will drop by someday and enlighten us all
and he turns away
through the swinging door
except for nutbeems chuckle
quoyle pulls up beside the ancestral home
agnis stands at the back of a rented truck sorting through materials in the payload
across a stretch of ground bunny is earnestly pretend reading a book to warren who lies listlessly before her
quoyle comes up behind agnis
he carries a newspaper and an excited air
listen to this
well we see the postman has landed in jail for days for throwing the mail in killick claw harbor
he said he had too much to deliver and folks could just take a dip and help themselves
he looks up eager for her reaction
she is still sorting through bolts of thick cloth spools of heavy thread odd mechanical devices
this is great stuff
a snowmobile mishap has taken the life of year old rick puff who was on his way home from what the widow puff calls a screech in and a carouse
when his machine fell through the ice
a well known accordion player mr
puff had served four years in the s for sexual assault on his daughters
bet they arent crying either
this billy pretty can really write
agnis absently passes as colorful
he looks into the truck
sees all the stuff
she surveys his puzzlement
nephew we cant fix up the house proper on a journalists wages
so i have un retired
been sought after for years wherever ive lived
this should be the real test huh
could be that
the sudden sound of footsteps above them makes him look up sharply to see
a fit young man in a toolbelt climbing down a ladder from the roof
the muscles of a stud the shy smile of a boy he waves a greeting and hops down the last six feet to the ground
this is dennis buggit master carpenter
dennis offers a hand and a smile that says hes expecting to like you
makes the sentiment contagious
only til i get my lobster license
im a fisherman in my soul
a strong handshake
on both sides
its a newfie thing the compulsion to fish
yhear yesterdays tragedy bout the newfie who went ice fishin
brought home pounds of ice
his wife fried it
they both drowned
quoyle laughs good and honest
dennis likes that
with me workin well need day care for bunny after school
turns out dennis and his wife send their little girl to this wonderful saintly woman
hows that for us livin a charmed life
quoyle nods if a bit cautious
dennis squints out across the bay
agnis says yer buyin a boat
sooners probly bettern lat
quoyle quiet smile im not buyin
sounds pretty sure of that
punctures the amiable ambiance with a shard of silence
well course were buy
quoyle to dennis buggit huh
any kin to my boss on the gammy bird
just got thunderous
a full beat
dennis low oh yeh
even the eyes glance down
what is that
in the wake of it
agnis cheerful gonna chat up yer daughter or just ignore her as usual
better do that
dennis sends a shy smile as if apologizing for the awkwardness
quoyle holds up a finger be right back and
heads on over to where bunny is reading to warren
warren threw up in your sleeping bag
shes got a stomach problem
quoyle takes a breath to answer but stops
hes caught a whiff
dog fart fells freelance reporter
promising career nipped in bud
its called cancer
quoyle holds his face together as bunny strokes the limp warren
then he crouches down
strokes warren too
billy prettys on the phone hand cupped over the receiver like its top secret
nutbeems tuning his ancient shortwave with a butter knife through the hole where a knob ought to be
and as quoyle sets down his sack lunch and thermos as he peels off his parka hes staring straight into the eyes of
tert card across the way
wearing a wicked and mysterious smile
as quoyles butt lowers toward his chair
ouoyle jumps a foot
looks from card to billy to nutbeem
whats going on
through the glass of the only private office sits a rumpled codger with a bullhorn
jack buggit has his rubber boots up on the desk scale spattered overalls over his compact sinewy body
his hair is wisps and shocks and his face is strewn with stubble split by a leprechauns grin around a stained hand rolled ciggie
jack into bullhorn tell the truth
jack waving him in with great energetic loops
the grin more rowdy than his boys
but the charm is there and more so
hold onto yer danglies little sister
closes the door behind him
jacks eyes are crinkly blue
they study quoyle good
and right in his face
jack into bullhorn based on my i
whered i rate
jack sets the bullhorn down advanced squirrel
this ties you with me an i own the place
holds out a brown fishermans hand
quoyle takes it
pleased tmeetcha billy says yer workin out
tert card says hes keepin an eye on ya
since hes a self servin liar helluva ad salesman tho it means hes jealous
lifts the bullhorn
jack into bullhorn nutbeem o
through glass jacks grin grows a twinkle
soft spot for the brit
nutbeems obsessed with actual news
makes up for it by manning the sexual abuse desk
cant keep up with the volume there were runnin three four a week
like hes dishing the lowdown
cards in charge
ya hear this and that bout his typos but typos is part of gammy bird
everyone gets a laugh and gets to figger em out
bettern a crossword
stabs out his cigarette
pulls a new one from a damp little box
well billys a writer and a fisherman
me im just a fisherman
offers the box
quoyle shakes him off
fishin and the sea is all i am
my pap the same
so he said
waitin for his license
jacks smile doesnt actually fade
but the eyes flicker and quoyle is sorry he opened his yap
naw my boys passed
went to sea and there he rests
bless his bones
his glance goes to a photo
jack and a strapping blond son
not dennis thats for sure
somehow we are suddenly down to business
want two things from ya quoyle
you cover every local car wreck take pictures
front page photo every week whether we have a wreck or not an we always do
when we dont we dip into cards file hes got some beauties
half a red geo being fished out of the water
petals lifeless torso hanging backwards out the door arms gracefully extended like a ballerina or olympic diver
knack to this
if theres a dark patch on the ground it reads blood whether its motor oil or diet coke
gloves hat lyin in the road
back to jack
canny and keen
he knows this stuff
somethin that humanizes makes ya feel
thats what a wreck is
its always saying there but for the grace of god
do ya follow
were starting a feature on the shipping news
what ships come in what goes out
whatevers of interest

well a water person
jack takes this in
the smile returns
if you catch my drift
quoyle shuts up
im no joke son and i dont tolerate jokes about newfies
or them that does
smash cut to
close on dennis holding a half eaten squidburger in two hands
oblivious to sawdust smoke and stench he is charmingly engagingly smashed
so this newfie comes to toronto
cabbie says take ya to meet girls for a good time
boy says okay but i only want a newfie girl
his audience is quoyle and nutbeem
each holds a squidburger of his own tentacles dangling
quoyle has his next one handy by his beer
right section of the party district he finds a girl they have sex she says thats a hunnerd dollars
he says fine tips her another hunnerd

quoyle takes a humongus bite

finally she says i never met so sweet a guy where ya from
he says misky bay newfoundland
she says really
quoyle hanging on the punch
he says i know

quoyle snorts his laughter dislodging a tentacled morsel or two
nutbeem has to look away as quoyle retrieves the chunks stuffs em back in his mouth
yer the model newfie q but fer thboat
why doncha buy nutbeems
drunken devilish smile
quoyle turns innocent questioning eyes
you got a boat
i built a chinese junk
sailed it up from brazil
missed manhattan by a mile or so got stranded here when i shipwrecked by gaze island
so casual and falsely modest quoyles eyes are big
almost finished my repairs
be leaving soon
as paleontologists define the term
studies quoyles amazement
and the only thing ive ever loved
yer story tugs at me bladder
and off he lurches to correct the situation
once hes gone
him and jack
their eyes meet
the brit sighs
jack buggits psychic start with that
hes got the gift
specially about the sea
should he tell it
quoyle makes a rolling hand motion hurry it up
older brother jesson everyones favorite even dennis
goes to sea like his dad
one day rest of the familys sitting by the radio and jack goes white
says jessons gone
walks out of the house
grief too big for walls to hold it
sets down the burger
runs a finger down the frost on his beer mug
so dennis is forbidden the sea
but being free newfie and he goes anyway
and thats enough t
monster wave cracks her steel hull amidships one inch crack from starboard to port
men go in the water
after a week
they come to jack call off the search
he stands like a stone
then turns sharp the way he does
says only hes alive
and i know where
mans a witch
went to sea alone in just a skiff
can you guess the odds
both arms broke dead
boy comes to
jack says if you ever step in a boat again ill drown ya mself
and you know what the kid said
quoyle glances over
dennis wobbling his way back through the tables
say it fast
says fishin licenses are all spoken for id appreciate you givin me yours
jack looked in his eyes
they never spoke ag
whats bein blabbed here
nutbeem not missing a beat quoyle says you got a nice ass
he raises his beer
to my ass
ill drink to that
and by god
quoyle and bunny climb out of the wagon
a small house its grassy yard strewn with a phantasmagoria of painted wood figures galloping horses dogs balanced on wheels a row of chrome hubcaps on sticks
a zoo of the mind
to one side a table piled with crafts ignored by
fifteen little kids running in all directions like bundled unbridled banshees
looks like fun
two harried mothers are trying to cope with the chaos
and there under a tree
the honey haired woman quoyle had seen on the ferry
and in the rain
she is on her knees tying the shoes of her vacant faced son
he trips and sprawls but he is laughing
the woman smiles tenderly and tousles his brown straw hair
quoyle gets up his courage
walks bunny over to them
as we arrive the woman looks up
quoyle really nervous hullo
its our first day and i was wond
whats wrong with him
she means of course the blankly staring boy
hey how bout we ask whats wrong with you
theres nothing wr
woman to bunny softly sure there is
this is herry and he has downs syndrome
it means he learns things very slowly
herry smiles at bunny
bunny to herry know how to be a dog
she drops to all fours and starts yapping like a terrier
herry laughs with delight
tumbles down to the grass and does his impression of a chihuahua on speed
bunny to the woman he looks fast to me
maybe hes cured
the kids waddle off in their canine personas
alone with the woman now quoyle is near catatonic
come on brain
which one of those women is in charge here
the woman looks at him
clear cornflower eyes
as comfortable in silence as he is agonized
then she squints out at the other women desperately running ragged after the kids
neither of em
theyre just moms
well my lord whoever runs the place should be giving this a little more attention
she looks back at him blankly
i mean children need structure
no ones even guarding that craft table they could be running around with scissors and get hurt
the womans eyes bottomless unreadable
the silence excruciating for poor quoyle
he clears his throat
i write for the newspa
but she stands
the grace and quickness of a jungle cat
id better get to work i see
providing structure and all
brushes off her skirt
he is in the dawning panic of beginning to realize
im wavey prowse and this is my place
pardon our antiquated emphasis on individuality and the freedom to have fun
heads off with a loose limbed stride
spins back around
running with sharp objects
we save for tuesdays
he gawks like a stupid animal
nods got it
shes already gone
quoyle and billy pretty stroll the teak deck of a massive elegantly outfitted barge
the wiry little fellow keeps his smile to his eyes
well she dont wear a ring cause she lost her husband at sea
just after the boy was born
quoyle nods blandly
as if it is a matter of no real concern well i was just
sharpenin those observation skills
first tool of a quality reporter
she has wonderful
billy has to smile yer know i never notic
look up ahead to the bow where a rolling bar has been set up
bayonet melville is mixing drinks
he has a florid face and striking white hair
dapper arrogant a guy with more money than hes worked for
as we approach
ever seen anything like her
quoyle looks to the sour faced middle aged lady who glances disdainfully at us above her gimlet
silver melville used to be pretty and rich
shes still rich
quoyle politely no sir your wife is very lovl
billy keeps a straight face
silver rolls her eyes
it was built for hitler
youve heard of hitler
up here in canada
he was in all the papers
silver snorts a laugh
melville wonders if that was irony
looking at quoyle he doubts thats possible
finest botterjacht ever built in holland
flat bottomed she can go right up on shore in a storm
incredibly heavy forty tons of oak
not unlike the barges of henry viii and elizabeth i
billy helpful we heard a them too
tell them what happened
in hurricane bob
he looks at his wife
clear in a glance they hate each others guts
go on she nods
pounded twelve beach houses
drunk and mean
and smarter than he is
now tell them
who let our insurance lapse
took six very expensive lawyers to weasel us out of it
an inch from bankruptcy
moral of the story
when you marry a tour guide
confine his authority to mixing the drinks
same again dear
and holds out her glass
billy looks out to sea
like he hasnt heard this
quoyle cheerful so
what brings you folks up from long island
while husband and wife glare at each other
my dining salon needs refitting
and the best custom yacht upholsterer in the northern hemisphere just moved here
i was forced
she turns to quoyle
who just gapes at her
quoyle softly oh
quoyle enters impressed by the progress of the renovation
windows are in walls patched floor sanded lights are working
through the place into
the kitchen which is in surprisingly usable shape
agnis sits alone at a butcher block table with a set of ledgers spread before her
a large mug of tea
a bottle of bushmills irish
you are a woman of mystery aunt
mystery and surprise
agnis still working silver melville says you was out there
be nice in yer story shes payin for a piece of this house
you said upholstery
never said yacht uphol
never said not
ask better questions you got a chance fer better answers
got my shop set up in killick claw now
sees hes dazzled by how she moves right along
two good workers
mavis bangs is an old plow horse like mself
dawns young and on the sexy side
you oughta drop by and say hullo
he absorbs that
how fast can he change the subject
agnis looks at him
reaches for the bushmills
upstairs in what will soon become her room
shell be all right
what does that mean
she pours some whiskey into her tea cup
little early in the day f
warren died today
thats what that means
drinks the whiskey
stares straight in his eyes
sees his sorrow
the honesty in
poor old girl
whether to tell him
i used to live with someone named warren
died of cancer after nine years together
dearest soul on this earth
what can he say
his empathy so naked so real even agnis has to soften her voice
went from the funeral and bought that dog
named her warren
just so i could say the name a hunnerd times a day
women are foolish huh
i never thought so
a good moment for them
it holds a beat
bunny wants to bury the dog with me
but i told her id rather do it alone
hed better go to her
some advice about the child
dont get down on her level the way you do
shell never respect you
bunny sits on the floor in dim light wearing an enormous blue sweatshirt
her naked barbies sit in a semi circle watching her braid a meticulous loop out of the paper and foil from chewing gum wrappers
quoyle enters and sits close beside her
watches in silence as she works
bunny not looking up warren died today
shes not coming back
just a hollow sound in her voice
thats the difference
he knows what she means
strokes her hair
another necklace huh
can i help
you can watch
he looks at the barbies
do i have to take my clothes off
she looks up at him
straight to his eyes
you look better with em on
goes back to work
he watches her
you do look good in blue
quoyle driving the wagon dennis at his side
up ahead on the road two figures
herry holds tight to his moms hand
quoyle pulls over and they stop
wavey squints at him against the sun
give you folks a lift
that extra beat before she says
were enjoyin the walk thank you
doesnt look angry either
my aunt cant bring bunny to the daycare shes got her shop now
but i worked it out with my boss
so ill be bringin her come next week

im sorry mr
quoyle about the other time
women can be moody you know
now she smiles
one tenth power
still a dazzler
only the best ones
did she like that
hard to tell
she looks around him
good afternoon dennis
give our respects to beety and marty
he waves will do
she takes herrys hand starts off down the road
quoyle sits and watches
quoyle looks over
his pal shrugs
rear angle of agnis walking over stones to the edge of the sea carrying something in her arms
walking to meet the sun as it gives its last to the shimmering water
reverse angle to see
she carries her old dog
on a clean sheet
rests the burden gently down
the incoming tide laps over
the sheet billows in it
she takes a step back
you were a good girl warren no trouble atall
surf rolls out
swims back in
flows around her friend
an outhouse stands unobtrusively near the edge of the cliff
see agnis alone approaching
something in her hand
as she reaches the outhouse we see it is
the ziploc bag
with her brothers ashes
she gazes back at the house now
then at the bag
agnis cold low hope ya like
what we done with the place
she opens the door enters
stares down into the deep hole
unzips the bag and
tips the ashes down into the hole
watch them in slo mo falling free
hear the rustle of agnis lifting her skirts and
close angle on agnis face
staring out at the sea through a small crack in the outhouse wall
hear the splatter as she voids herself
agnis a murmur welcome home
daycare in progress
the comfy parlor has been given over to the kids
a wall of polaroids of each child faces a map of newfoundland with drawings of moose caribou and lobster
little herry sits alone in a doorway watching with big eyes as
quoyle bunny astride his back rampages around the parlor on all fours snorting like a crazed boar
the kids are squealing delighted making excited little runs at him swatting him with throw pillows and rolled up sweaters
thrill of the hunt
wavey comes through the doorway drying her hands just behind where her boy sits
quoyle doesnt see her hes thrashing and bellowing lost in the game
she watches for a long beat
then leans down to herry
wavey a whisper go on
get the pig
herry grins like the devil
dashes off to plow into the prey knocking them sprawling
kids piling on
waveys unseen smile
the start of something
close on quoyle
he is happily washing a mountain of dishes and cups
so the newfie drills another hole in the ice aways off from the first one
once again the voice booms pull back to see wavey beside him
shes drying what he washes
so he moves way down the ice
drills another hole
voice comes again i said no fish down here
they dont look at each other
poker faced just alike working side by side
the newfie looks around
hollers who are ya
the voice o god
voice comes back no
the arena manager
he cant help but snort out a chuckle of his own
sneaks a look over at her and she
laughs out loud
but from the delay he guesses
heard it before huh
she looks over at him
her eyes dance a little
sometimes passion in performance
beats the element of surprise
and he is lost in those eyes
knows its showing
glances away to where
bunny sits in a corner
reading to a rapt herry
you guys hungry
im teaching herry to read
just like i did warren
is he learnin
bunny looks over at him
he is so dumb
first is the teaching part
the learning comes later
and out of the blue
now are the berries ready to pick
quoyle looks over to the woman
but instead of wavey he sees petal staring at him with slow predatory heat
want to pick my berries do you
should i climb right up on this sink
and then once more she is
you know its all about timing
quoyle alone in the office pretending to peck away at a story
actually hes looking
through the window
where jack buggit tert card billy pretty and nutbeem are all circling around a small roughly made boat attached to its rented trailer
they are talking to each other in learned tones
a talmudic chat
in they come
first through the door
thats yer boat
said it was
one question remains
he looks from one face to another
even billy is irritated
nutbeem gazes down embarrassed for him
a boats a boa
its a shit boat
best thing get rid of it some dark night
quoyle cant believe this
hot shame burns
go hire alvin yark to build ya a sweet little rodney
this things a wallowing cockeyed bastard thatll sink in a bathtub
and standing in the doorway the scariest sight of all
just shaking his head
jack sadly you dont have the sense god gave a doughnut do ya
the word from sinai on quoyles worth
im goin fishin
out the door with a slamm
quoyle stares hopelessly after him
dont jump off a bridge over it
anyone can make a brainless asinine devastatingly revealing blunder
quoyle actually means this thanks
what in th furry pit of newfie hell
holds up some sheets of paper
photos of the melvilles botterjacht
that goes with the shipping news
profile of a vessel in port
what about the car accident
thats the one i didnt do
diddolate sprained her wrist
card still reading
so you didnt do the one jack told yer to do and you did one he dont know yer did
than yer boat
he looks up
equal parts disgust and delight
jack even sniffs this he cuts you up fer lobster bait
ive half a mind to run it
quoyle straightens his spine
strides off for the door
as for the part about you havin half a mind
out the door
slamm harder than jacks
quoyle stumbling toward his wagon with vacant eyes
reporter disembowels self with rusty joke
quoyle in a carpenters belt climbing very carefully from a ladder onto the roof
his vertigo apparent as he keeps to his hands and knees trying to fight the compulsion to look down
gives in to it peering from the corner of his eye down the cliff the rocks the sea so far below
not a good dea
comes to the shingles
eases his way into a fearful crouch
jack i completely understand i would fire me too
nodding in time to the hammer strokes
in a heartbeat
hammers louder speaking in rhythm
you give me a chance and what happens
i buy the wrong boat i write the wrong story i am the lowest form of alleged life
in fact your comment
was an insult to the doughnut
hear now what the hammering had masked
someone is reaching the top of the ladder climbing onto the roof
somehow she has managed to climb while carrying a sandwich on a plate
and an open bottle of soda
he stares at her uncomprehending
egg salad and nehi grape
she sets them down
stands up on the steep pitch
quoyle shocked stupid baby
theyre mine but ill share
as the plate and bottle slip neatly off the roof and after a noticeable beat shatter softly far below
bunnys turn to be shocked
shes contemplating going after them
okay that was a little loud
it has also scared the kid out of her wits
quoyle regrets this
starts scooching awkwardly down the slope inches at a time
quoyle too casual were gonna play wait for daddy
can you play that
shes just staring over the side
hypnotized by the sight
hes slipping toward her
toward the edge
and if you dont move
until i get there
closer reaching toward her back
then you win
grabs her arm she startles violently lurching but he yanks her to him
holds her to his heart
he is breathing like a freight train
was so easy
jack buggit enters with energy
billys typing nutbeems reading
quoyle is cleaning out his desk pulling things off his little shelf to pack away
goofy photo of bunny
ceramic child made three legged turtle
tiny padded box with what looks to be carefully preserved empty eggshells
jack heads toward him
did ya see the hitlers barge piece jocko
i saw it
and heard from some whod done the same
to quoyle good
pretty much all his possessions are in a big cardboard box
jack peers into it
but hes smiling
like hes got the point
thing about the barge piece
i just thought itd perk up th
got six phone calls bout that piece
thatd be like half a million calls in toronto
grasps quoyle around the back of the neck
people liked it old son
crowd went down to the dock tsee the thing but itd already pulled out
quoyle stares slack faced into the elfin eyes
course you dont know anything about boats but thats entertaining too
so go ahead with it
thats the kinda stuff i want see
just now cards jaw is scraping his boot tops
from now on you write a column every week
the shipping news
gonna order you a computer and everything
and yknow the beauty part
i dont have to tell card all over again cause hes already eavesdroppin
so im free to take mleave
youve an instinct for character and idiosyncrasy old son
he heads toward the door
and never looking at him
zip yer fly card
card looks down
he zips up as the door slams
billy pretty sends quoyle a thumbs up without turning
nutbeem clasps his hands above his head like a winning prizefighter
quoyle slides a sheet of paper into his typewriter
stares at it
thirty eight years
first time anybody said you done it right
a woman looks up from her stitching
she is solidly built pushing emily dickinson hair
a cheerful calmly butch way about her
nephew this is mavis bangs
a real professional
mavis holds out a hearty hand
agnis is showing him the shop
a cutting table two sewing stations
billowing sailcloth hung over the windows
racks of leathers and fabrics
and this is dawn budgel
shes a vegetarian
dawn once described by agnis as young and on the sexy side is that
red lipstick and nails
her eyes float up in a way that suggests reflexive sensuality
agnis nods to her and the girl reaches a slender pale hand
agnis is always saying such
things about you
its nice to fit a man
with the name
and as she releases his hand her eyes flick to agnis
some conspiracy there
quoyle follows his aunt back to the big cutting table
i just uh came to see if youd heard abou
snuck off in the night they did
not a penny paid for all we done
shows him sheets of baby blue leather
wed installed the banquettes in her salon
three of the chairs done and delivered three to go
points to them
a neat row by the makeshift kitchenette
thats just terrible
but agnis is thinking
leavin the chairs
and as he glances off he sees dawn across the way
her skirt hiked up as if she were adjusting a stocking
she isnt wearing any
billowy clouds frame a languid kite silver and sleek darting this way and that
graceful in command of the currents
see her now seated atop a grassy slope
it is she who holds the string and her boy is way down at the bottom of the hill with bunny
blue jumper billowing the girl is teaching him how to make necklaces from wildflowers and garbage bag twisty ties
herry and the naked barbies watch with great attention
the learning will come later
on this he looks up
pull back slightly to reveal that quoyle has been sitting right beside her all along
he holds the string of a big glum kite that hangs motionless in space with barely a flutter
as she watches the kids he stares at her fixedly deciding whether to ask
quoyle barely audible do you think bunnys
wavey looks over
sees that hes worried half to death
in new york
they said she had a
wavey softly and it was named petal
do you understand that
all these hallucin
the white dog
sometimes with the skinny ghost
kids do things like that its called imagination
like the necklaces
the necklaces yeh
a thought that frightens him
you know how many she makes
its a skill shes proud of it
and she brings her dolls along
and she looks good in blue
and she wears a key for a good luck charm
her kind smile
no big deal
and shes saving her mother a room
did she tell you that
waveys slow nod
she talks to her at night
i can hear through the door
very quiet now
you know how kids think
you have all those books
the ones i read to teach herry
they dont make me an exp
quoyle blurting just
is she okay
that was naked
if you had to guess
too serious a subject
too good a woman
for an easy lie
that child is the only friend my son ever had
so shes strange you bet
she swallows too
her eyes are damp
i love that little girl
and i will see to it
that shes all right
hold the look
and i dont have to guess about it
quoyle running huffing through a bog with every color of berries imaginable
around another bend in the path
hands on his knees
he trudges back the way he came
peeks around a bend to see
bunny is teaching berry to pick gooseberries
this time the learning has started
they are being very careful
if you pick enough we can sell em for a thousand dollars
and give it to aunt agnis to make up for those staties who didnt pay h
bunny means business then dont
quoyle slaps his hands across his mouth
he tiptoes off
rounds a bend
walking faster now
around another bend
hold on his face
reverse angle to take his view of
petal kneeling in a flimsy sundress picking berries
barefoot her skirt hiked up stained with berry juice
and when she turns to him
she is still petal
her face is beautiful and filled with tender desire
she looks at him the way he has always dreamed she would
he goes to
kneel beside her
touch her waist
and now she is
his hand is on waveys waist and it comes slowly away
but her eyes are locked to his
making her choice
wavey very soft look
i like you
even in kindness he can smell rejection
he starts to back away but she takes his hand
i want us
to be friends okay
he nods dumbly
to understand each other
quoyle so sorry i understand
my husband drowned
hard for her
he was two months old
and herold took the boat out
to fish for haddock
do you understand
because i liked
its four years
she stares in his eyes
and its yesterday
now did i blow it
or can you still be my friend
quoyle nods sure
ill be your friend
but what she sees is a lifetime of being quoyle washing past his eyes
it makes her murmur
what are you thinking
and from his heart
im thinking im sorry
he stands up
hear him stumble off
hold on her
a grassy place above an empty sea
the rest of the world far away
two figures climb the gentle hill
howre you doin with the tall and quiet woman
cindy crawford and me is doin fine
i meant wavey prowse
my dad used to say theres four women in every mans life
the stouthearted woman
oh thatd be agnis
the maid in the meadow
quoyle has to think bunny i guess
weavin a daisy chain necklace
the tall and quiet woman
she does have that posture goin
and the demon lover
quoyles smile fades
he looks away
theyve reached a fence where blunt pickets enclose crosses and wooden markers many fallen on the ground
billy wistful me dad said that
billy finds the right marker
sets his satchel onto the grass
his old fingers clear debris from painted words thats me poor father
thirteen i was when he died
he hears the thread of feeling in his simple words
and says no more
withdraws two cans of paint from his bag
one white one black
lays them out carefully for this task is sacred
every time i wonder
is this the last coat
pries the lid off the tin of black
and when he sees quoyles eyes
well theres no one else to do it ysee
quoyle straight back there is now
an easy smile
stating the obvious
the old mans face just stops
the eyes sharpen
into a question
well you said
theres no one else
as if that were enough
if you wanna rest next to him
ill paint yours at the same time
no extra trouble
billy stares at him
stares at him
clears his throat gruffly
then better get alvin yark
tbuild yer a real boat
so yerll be around
quoyle exits the house pulling on his jacket and
something laid across his threshold
a long piece of twine has been placed there
knots tied evenly along its length
he glances back up to the second floor thinking bunny
looks at the thing again
slips it in his pocket
quoyle now making his way down a steep primitive trail through lush vegetation
the green house is far above him
the shimmering bay now just below
this way down as treacherous as it is wondrous and quoyle slips in the tangle and wet half slides through wild angelica stalks and patches of dogberry suddenly
losing his balance tumbling roughly down a stretch rolling grasping a spruce trunk
pulling himself to his feet he hears
looks up just as
a white dog appears through the bushes
lips curled back
a frozen second of mutual indecision and quoyle
screams and falls on his butt
takes off bounding down a path we hadnt noticed
toward an upright silhouette
who steps into sun just long enough to become
a man grizzled and scrawny and quick
gone in a flash
like a skinny ghost
and there on his butt
quoyle laughs softly
how bout that
youre smartern all of us
as he climbs to his feet he sees the rocky beach just below
squints as if at something that doesnt belong
we see it now
a suitcase washed up onto a tangle of rocks just offshore
quoyle wading into the water
up to his knees slips sinks to his waist
snatches the suitcase from its perch
brings it back to shore holding it high
already he is making the face of someone smelling something hed rather not
he sets it down
the face is worse
his curiosity running the show he unhooks the latch
because hes staring inside
suddenly he screams and flails back his leg striking the case and out tumbles onto the wet ground
of bayonet melville
five squidburgers quoyle likes his backups ready and waiting
yknow none a that impresses jack buggit
hes not one fer blatant ambition
quoyle thinks better of his answer
chomps a bite instead
even if you dont recognize human head packed in satchel as the most compelling piece ever to appear in
card snorts even if
takes his hand from his greasy burger
scratches his crotch below the table
a triple increase in ad revenue
the mans attention
and winks at the silent hero
werent even double if yer figger it right
to quoyle point is
a real reporter woulda named the obvious suspect
than the wife
yer aunt ya thick statie lardface dumbass
just look at each other
she gets stiffed by the guy after basin her new shop on that revenue
and she aint one ta fool with
capable a anything that woman
quoyle angry now okay wheres the wife
agnis kill her too
okay wheres this weeks shipping news
or you gonna rest on yer crisco coated laurels
quoyle viciously bites into his squidburger
the way hes chewin he aint a fat boy tbe trifled with
nutbeem quietly his piece
is about oil tankers
looks at quoyle with dare we say new respect
hope fer ya yet
now thats news the mcgonigle oil field
petrodollars a golden flood a jobs
thats thfuture a this god forsaken ice rock
scratches his crotch savagely
to honor civilization
thats why those with half a brain already put our money where our mouths is
puts his squidburger
where his mouth is
nutbeem clarifies for quoyle
brightly lit kitchen
bunny sits at the little table a large mixing bowl filled with popcorn before her little herry at her side
they are watching freakazoid on a tiny tv
bunny shovels in a mouthful of popcorn
then makes a sage if unintelligible comment about the show to herry
still chewing she takes another huge handful of popcorn
herry opens his mouth like a baby bird
bunny stuffs the snack in
its a stare and chew side by side
quoyle sits in a barca lounger with a huge bowl of chips in his lap
he is watching hockey on a modest tv the action is fierce
stuffs his mouth full of chips yet somehow manages to say
so there they were this goofy old codger and his dog big as life
pull back to see wavey now
curled on the sofa under a lap robe
she is knitting something in a heavy oxblood colored wool
he watches her work
wavey softly thatd be old nolan
hes actually your uncle last of the crazy quoyles
i should have realized
keeps her eyes on her work
lives like a hermit in a run down shack
no one to look after h
here i was worried about bunny night and day and theres absolutely nothing wrong with her
which makes him uneasy
her only problem is her dad worries too mu
wavey not looking up you are a loving and wonderful father
youre not the problem
she meant to reassure him
so what is th
nice to see you
looks up with smoky eyes
after all this time
ive been workin longer hours
so dennis and beety were kind enough to bring bunny to the daycare
fed her a lotta meals too
theyre real friends
quoyles smile tries to sell the innocence of his absence
wavey very quiet i thought you forgot
that im your friend too
no smile from her
she wants him to know she was hurt
he shakes his head serious now
no i didnt forget
you want another sandwich
theres roast pork
he holds up whats left of his four decker
this is plenty
takes a huge bite to show how much he likes it
youd read me your article
he did he nods
but just now hes scared to
and so she smiles
which traps him
he pulls out a single sheet of paper
clears his throat
nobody hangs a picture of an oil tanker
thats the header
he gestures go back to your knitting
so she smiles slyly
and commences to knit
quoyle reads theres a photo hung in the library
eight schooners heading out to fishing grounds sails spread it like white wings
this means something to him
hear it in his voice
quoyle reads more common today is the low black profile of oil tankers
like the ruptured golden goose which last week bled tons of crude onto seabirds fish and boats at cape despond
as if revisiting that little thought in his mind
quoyle reads there will be more and more tankers
they will grow old and corroded and their tanks will split
they have already done to fishing
what their spill has done to fish
he sneaks a glance
she has never looked up
quoyle reads nobody hangs a picture of an oil tanker
on their wall
a full one
i think when card sees it hell split a gut
i think hell sit up nights thinking of cheap shots to pay you back
i think hell never stop until youre fired
quoyle keeps nodding at each point
i think i havent been so proud
of a friend
since i dont know when
quoyles heart explodes in his chest
and shines in his eyes
there is a long silence
wavey softly maybe another sandwich
theres roast pork
he just doesnt want to cry from happiness
close on card
who is ripping the single page in half
see quoyle now standing at the desk like a statue
billy and nutbeem at their stations watching as card
flutters the pieces down onto his desk
like falling snow
oh ill run it
just easier tcopy edit
when yer can move thpieces around
a frozen tableau in this room
like i wrote it
how does this suit yer quoyle
ill do my job
you do yers which means a four vehicle pile up south a killick claw
and dont ferget the camera
he slides the battered camera across the desk
they glare at each other a full beat
card belches softly
quoyle takes the camera heads for the door
i fergot somethin
you pinko greepeace sack a quivering pigfat
did i leave out moosebutt ugly
nods to himself you may go
hold on him
making a neat little pile of the torn pieces
like i wrote it
across the room nutbeem stands
takes his cigarettes
passing cards desk on the way out
card shoots billy a challenging look
you got something to say
i hope you get him fired
so i can watch him beat yer to jelly
just turns around
flicks on his computer
back to work
bunny jumping out of the wagon running to the house
as quoyle locks his car
whyd you leave the house open
he looks up
she is pushing the front door with one finger
it swings open
can i keep the necklace
and lifts a long piece of twine
there are knots neatly tied along its length
quoyle calm sweetie
come sit in the car
quoyle climbing the stairs in fading light
he carries a tire iron
listens to the silence
up up to the top
looking down the empty hall to see
at every door
quoyle enters haggard and distracted
the place is lit but empty
a toilet flushes
from the loo appears
yer fancy it
nodding toward something behind quoyle
turning we see that hanging over cards desk is an oversized framed photo of quiet eye worlds largest oil tanker
quoyle stares blankly
like i said
nobody hangs those
card just goes to the fresh stack of newspapers on his desk
hands one toward quoyle
yer columns front page stuff
only now its more like a caption is all
a photo of the same tanker
that hangs on cards wall
quoyle reads more than tankers proudly ride the worlds seas
even the biggest take advantage of newfoundlands deep water ports and refineries
spelled everthin perfect
so as not tembarrass yer
quoyle reading oil and newfoundland go together like ham and eggs and like ham and eggs theyll nourish us in the coming years
even put yer name on it
quoyle finishes reading lets all hang a picture of an oil tanker
on our wall
stares at the paper
in his hand
man a yer principles
i unnerstan resignation is thonly honorable course
quoyle looks up
card flinches back
but all that comes is
how can a man resign
drops the paper on the floor
steps on it on his way toward the door
if yer off to see jack buggit yerll hafta swim some
quoyle turns back
yer can whine an beg thim
but i runs his paper every inch of it every dirty time eatin job which he would have tdo without me
an if yer think hes gonna choose you over fishin
yer not as smart as even you look
the cackle of the guy holding the straight flush
me an jack
has a sym bi otic relationship
yer can look that up
quoyle puts his hand on the door
i know the word card
it means you two deserve each other
out the door
it closes behind him
card alone crosses his arms in glee
hold on card
close on a box of assorted doughnuts
a hand reaches down toward a raspberry swirl thinks better of it moves thoughtfully along the selection to pluck a maple glaze and bring it to
the box rests beside the cardboard carton into which quoyle is packing his things
nutbeem sits on the edge of the desk nibbling a cruller
billy is bringing three mugs of coffee
looks like a going away party
through the glass of the only private office
jack buggit is talking
card is not
card stands now strides to the door flings it open
nutbeem taps quoyles shoulder with his pastry
they look to
this is what jack and i think
hes looking straight in quoyles eyes
defiant as ever
we wanna run quoyles oil spill piece bcause controversy sells papers and papers sells ads
sounds reasonable to me
lives to needle this guy
card keeps his laser gaze on quoyle
and were gonna let quoyle have his head on these columns up to words
so hell get his confidence up
well lets not go overboard
hes rather green doncha thi
but we wanna expand his responsi bilities to boat crashes
theres maybe four a week
hell need a raise
and need to be represented in the negotia
the oil tanker picture
nutbeems eyes widen
he mimes catching an arrow shot through his chest
falls off the desk
card to quoyle all that clear
quoyle looks him in the eyes
starts putting his things back in his desk
one more thing
hear the slamm
quoyle never looks up jacks gone fishing
the sky threatens black
quoyle picks his way across the rocks to his ungainly much maligned boat as it bobs against the weathered dock
he crouches and as he begins to untie it his gaze drifts out toward the nearby point and
something catches his eye
a boulder in the shape of a great dog
and as he stares there is something below it
something in a cove protected from intrusion by a jagged ring of menacing rocks
it is a man in a yellow suit
his head under the surface as if looking for fish
arms and legs spread out like a starfish the body slides in and out of a small cave
tugged by the sea like a top on a string
quoyle stares in frozen shock
reporter becomes magnet for dead men
no way in past the pounding surf the savage rocks
so quoyle turns sharply
squints across the bay
what was my panic
he was already dead
maybe i thought in some dim way
climbs into his boat turns the engine over
kicks it in overdrive toward the town across the bay
if it wasnt too late for him
it wouldnt be for petal
streaking out toward the black sky
racing to open sea where the chop increases drastically
once i was past the shelter of the lee shore and into the real wind
i realized my mistake
clear of the points protection the wind rocks the tiny craft swells coming broadside
the boat rises then drops with cruel speed
quoyle tries to swing the boat around the propeller races the bow pitches violently slamming down the stern swamped the hull filling swerving broadside just as the oncoming sea hits
with all its force and the little boat
rolls over quoyle suddenly flying under water limbs flailing in all directions
reporter becomes anchor man
quoyles dad flinging him into the public pool the youngster sinking like an anvil in a profusion of bubbles and back to quoyle struggling madly somehow to the surface thrashing
toward the overturned boat grasping the stilled propeller shaft which causes the bow to lift the next wave turning the boat upright filling it with water and it sinks forever as quoyle
tumbles once more beneath the surface watching the boat disappear into darkness below him
stupid to drown with bunny so young
no life jacket no floating oar
back to the surface gasping for air
and then daintily rowing a small boat unaffected by the waves her filmy dress rippling in light breeze
look it floats
just like you
is the lilting smile cruel
or only the irony that conveys intimacy even affection
maybe its filled with fat
in her place bobs a red box
a plastic beer cooler
he lunges for it gripping the handles resting his chest on its top
the waves rise mountainous now and he rises and falls with them
he has been swept a mile from the nearest shore
a winch pulling part of the geo streaming mud from swiftly flowing water
police and bystanders gathered
and i wondered
am i going where shes gone
back to the bay
a barely conscious quoyle still clings somehow to the plastic cooler
but hours have passed
light is fading
and will i see her
and there she is
beaming at him from the bow of her little rowboat a smile ambiguous in the growing dusk
it could be love
from behind her a light glows giving petal the aspect of an angel
she drops a wink
and the light becomes
the beam from a fishing boat
quoyle squints his swollen eyes as strong hands wrench him from his box
from the sea
a voice warbles distorted by wind and quoyles diminished consciousness
jesus cockadoodle christ
i knowed somebody was out here
quoyles teeth are chattering so hard his body shivering so painfully buggit hauls him over the rail and lays him down on a wriggling mound of fish
thank god fer yer figure me old son
a thin man woulda froze
quoyle burrows into the fish like nestling in a down comforter
jack covers him with a heavy tarp
crouches down close
yer lost thboat
quoyle stirs beneath the billowing down coverlet
his eyes flutter
very soft its all right
youre in heaven
his head snaps around
shes sitting just beside the bed in half shadow
her oxblood knitting across her lap
its just my bed
now he sees the cigarette
actually its not
i just wanted to see your eyes bug out like that
now he sees the smile
you dont smoke
his voice was a croak
so he clears his throat with a massive and disgusting effort
it is gross and funny and she smiles again
only when im worried
i dont worry much
he rolls over to see her better
they are very close
you dont have to im all right
im in heaven
im not worried
as he draws a breath to ask
youre in the boys room at jacks house
wonder how long since dennis slept here
she glances to the nightstand
beneath the dim lamp
a picture of jack and blond son jesson
guess what theyre doing
buggit called knew bunny was still with me
the kids are camped out in the parlor
you sittin up with me
a longer one
someday youll do somethin nice for me
who you worried ab
you didnt find a second dead man
just the rest of the first one
well that figures
who you worried about
on this she stubs out her cigarette
takes another from the pack
you said bunny talks to petal at night
you ever listen
he shakes his head
wouldnt be right
well im not that nice a person
strikes a match
she plays petal
talks to the barbies like petal talking to her
brings her cigarette
to the flame
she says shes sorry she left them
it was just to see if they could be good girls
and they were
and she loves them
his eyes at once rapt and suffering
she watches that
the barbies look better naked bunny looks good in blue guess who said that
draws on her smoke
so we talked
just before petal left her with that
bunny had snapped her moms bead necklace
thats why shes making more
do you understand
when shes made enough
shell be forgiven
tears are pooling in his eyes
she keeps going
she saves petal a room at the house but shes also got the key to the old place
in case her mom would rather go there
a thin stream of air escapes from his lips
and she talked about it
just like that
sure i lied
i said nice things about her mother
see theres only one problem
petal isnt gone
what can he do
so were patient
and we wait and were good to her
she stares back
unease to match his own
a wiry wisp of an aged elf alvin yark is shaping the center beam of what will become a tidy boat
its wooden skeleton across two sawhorses in his spacious workshop
alvin sings softly to himself oh the gandy goose it aint no use
it aint no use the gandy goose
quoyle wavey and dennis stand in a row
watching the little artisan shave wood as if his tools were his hands
alvin keeps singing as if alone the gandy goose she aint no uuuuse
cause all her nutsn bolts is loose
wavey cant help but smile
she really likes the old duck
alvin never turning see im already buildin yers in me mind
the singin helps that
gotta take a walk in the woods find a spruce with jest th right curve fer yer stem
and says no more
they are like acolytes at the feet of a guru who never bothers even to glance their way
well hurry up
thirty forty years ill be rarin to get back out on the water
except the guru
gotta build her solid
who knows mebbe jack buggitll give his fishin license to his boy
so next time wont be nobody to pull yer out
dennis real quiet jack buggits boy is drowned
except the guru
alvin cheery dennis
yhear the one about the newfie who lived ferever
his kid never got a fishin license
now he turns
a maritime yoda squinting to discern if his message is received
what we wait fer
shes like the main stem
gives us our shape doncha see
he runs his hand along the backbone of the boat hes building
deaths one shape
fergiveness is another
crinkly old eyes laser bright
dennis isnt angry
thing bout waitin on fergiveness
mixes up whos waitin on who
no smile no spin
just the truth
death is simpler
an a lot shorter wait
in the silence
a door opens
a sprightly bird like woman
wears apology and concern
the school is callin
its about yer daughter
the principal is spare dressed for england her voice authoritarian by its pace exaggerated diction and lack of volume
not only pushed mrs
not only pushed her very hard
seated in a semi circle around the desk of power
quoyle stricken respectful
wavey already pissed off at the principal
and bunny her hat and coat on arms folded face crimson and set
do you understand the severity of this mr
refuses to explain her act
is that right young lady
under the circumstances
we have no choice but to suspend
bunny looks down
glaring an evil spell of death at her own kneecaps
wavey quietly i think bunny and i
should take a walk
if its all the same to you
quoyle and bunny alone hand in hand walking slow where they once picked berries
when you gonna ask
quoyle calm when youre in the mood
apparently that hasnt happened yet
she musta done something
said like he means it
which he does
and bunny squinting up sees that
playground filled with kids
bunny and girlfriends on the jungle gym
bunny the best a natural jock
lumbull large sour doughy and betrayed by life stands with her silver whistle in the midst of chaos
her thoughts on a higher plane
shes the worst one of all
little herry prowse comes to tug at the teachers wool coat
he is holding his crotch and jumping up and down
this does not require an advanced credential to interpret
herry told her he had to pee
but the way he talks
he could just say eeee like that
lumbull looks down
from her face as she responds she has already devoted over time more professional attention to this troublemaker than should be asked of any dedicated educator
she told him that recess was almost over an she wasnt gonna make a trip special an he could hold it
herry seemingly disagrees
still holding his crotch he jumps up and down with greater agitation
she grabs him rather roughly by the arm
marches him over to
she made him stand against the wall
and walks off pointedly ignoring him from ten feet away
he screams pumping his fists in frustration
grabs himself suddenly
whether or not we can see the dampness spread we can see his humiliation all too clearly
as his tears come
a figure bolts into frame from behind mrs
hunched over like a linebacker full speed ahead launching herself into the back of the large womans knees
her feet go up and the rest of her goes
down like the proverbial amount of bricks
herrys tears stop fast
watching the woman shriek and keep shrieking
makes him laugh
the berry path
they are sitting on a fallen log
see a good dad would say hitting is always wrong
you coulda hurt her bad
i guess you know that
she wasnt hurt for real
just screamed like a baby
quoyle pulls out a single snickers bar
wish id seen it
it really sounds funny
petalll think so too
he looks at her
nods probably will
peels the candy bar free of its wrapper
well there wont be any trouble at school
iii take care of that
he breaks the candy bar in half
tho not quite equally
because the best thing about people
is they can forgive each other
i heard that this morning
is gonna forgive me
and she wont want the story printed in the paper
i dont wanna forgive her
he holds out the two pieces of candy
she takes them both
the bigger one in his mouth
as he chews
i had to do it
cept for wavey im the only family herrys got
she nibbles at her own piece
like the ghost
whos not a ghost
the one who ties the knots
youre the only family hes got
her father doesnt react
hes even stopped chewing
quoyle picks his way down to the battered boat shed hidden at the foot of his cliff
he carries a big carton which we see has made the journey slow and awkward
across the gravel now to
hear the fire crackling see the smoke curling
takes a breath
juggle the box lift the latch
the old man and the dog huddled together at the fire
they look over with red eyes
only one growls
quoyle finds a smile a soft voice
my daughter bunny and i
we got you some hot bread
and some meat
some dried fish
some squash and vegetables
some warm clothes
nolan is listening
sharp eared sharp eyed
what trick is this
so quoyle sets the carton down in the squalor
takes out a loaf of fresh bread
one step forward
lay it down
good faith offering
nolan scuttles to it
like a wary crab
he tears off a chunk of bread
he likes it
and as he eats
quoyle softly you tied those knots huh
at my house
crouches down to the old mans size
almost close enough to touch
aint yer house its th ouoyle house
hes found the meat
ripped off a chunk
see i am qu
got run outta omaloor bay a hunnerd years ago
dragged that house across th ice
on spruce runners
stuffs some into his face
like this even better
hadda lash it to th rock
shell tell yer
course she never come tsee me
thats obvious why
and as quoyle draws a breath to ask
your aunt agnis hamm me son
thats cause she cant face me
i knows she killed im
of stone silence
that baby she was carryin
what was she tdo
she wuz only
an it was her own brother what done er
quoyles wide eyed shock
quoyle numb her own
a tiny frozen pond
a girl of rawboned husky skating alone
weve seen her in the photo at quoyles dads house
and as she skates she looks up to see
a boy of stocky sullen
he was in the same photo
only now he steps onto the ice
unbuttons his pants
begins to slide toward her on the soles of his fishing boots
she looks around
snow banked on all sides of the pond
nowhere to run on her skates
her brother me son
she only had th one
the girl breathless skating this way and that
the boy closing in cutting off her angle
a deadly endgame
there are no words
he is on her
pulling her tumbling to the ice in slo mo
no sound but their hot breath the grunt of the struggle and cut back to
course no one alive knows no more
so her an me
agnis and mavis are showing wavey their new shop
it is big and bright with more elaborate fittings the amount of work piled up carries the scent of success
quoyle trails behind as agnis dotes on wavey like a prize new daughter in law
when she turns she sees her nephew staring
my hem crooked
as if i was wearin a hem
he was staring pretty intently
naw i just come from seein your cousin nolan
guess i was thinkin about him
she holds his gaze with her own
is she wondering
what do you think of my dress
everybody turns on that one
mavis cuts her alter ego agnis a look
can you believe this slut
i wore it just for you
she actually looks pretty good in it
wavey noticing that
watching quoyle say
that was more consideration
than i deserve
or outright flirting
hard to tell if its wavey or agnis who disapproves more
dawn ignores them
did your aunt tell you about all the money
agnis just blinks
can scarcely believe she heard that
agnis told us it came from macau
agnis quietly hush yoursel
from silver melville
and it was more than she expected
and we shipped the chairs off to her
y know the three remaining
a really frozen beat
quoyle casual to agnis uh
why would she send you more tha
agnis to dawn do you have enough attention now young lady
yes maam i think so
mavis echoes agnis glare
quoyle really casual macau huh
that where ysent th chairs
sizes him up
its flatterin you showin me how youve turned into such a competent reporter and all
but even if i remembered where i sent em
i couldnt tell ya
puts her fingers to her lips
leans closer to confide something he is obviously unaware of
close on wavey cooking flapjacks
talking to them
could do this
and shes not pleased
you fed him
you gave him clothes
youre the first human ever was kind to him
she scoops them expertly into a stack
youre sick with guilt
serves them to
you sure youre not a complex guy
quoyle who nods absently
about the one thing he is sure of
just now hes examining the prodigious status of her oxblood knitting
still attached to the needles it looks too broad for a muffler
quoyle decides horse blanket
thats what that is
so if ycalled around
musta found somepla
wavey quietly one decent golden age home
its in st
you can maybe afford it tho god knows why you should
she pushes the flapjacks closer to him clanks down the fork eat
thinks hes wasting his money
i cant put him there til i go down to st
see its all right
lets not be rash
come with me
i mean the kids could stay with dennis and beety
or agnis or
a meaningful beat
she looks deep in his eyes
hard to guess the answer she wants to hear
he clears his throat
remember when you said
someday id do something nice for you
and when he looks to her she is
petal waveys voice and this is it
a witheringly sexy smile
overnight trip to st
all expenses paid
petal arches a delicate brow
petal waveys voice overnight
whats wrong with a weekend
with a playful smile
of her own
not london but it might as well be
wavey and quoyle atop a red double decker bus wind whipping their hair
she is watching the big city flow past drinking every inch of it
hes watching her
wavey carries an armload of little girls tights and corduroy pants picking through a bin of barrettes
quoyle appears with a fistful of neckties
holds them up hopefully to his chest one at a time each more breathtakingly godawful than the last
she shivers with disgust
lifts from her shopping bag a nice conser vative one shes already picked for him
he shivers just as she did
they share the trace of a grin just alike
he walks off
wavey trying on furry hats in a full length mirror as quoyle keeps feeding her an endless supply from a double armful
she pouts and poses like a runway model basically frowning that the hats arent working
hes staring at her as if nothing else exists in the universe
she knows it
wavey alone at a cash register
the checker is ringing up a selection of lacy bras and panties
suddenly wavey looks up to see quoyle at the register one aisle over staring fixedly at her purchases
seeing shes noticed him he holds up a huge pair of loud boxer shorts hes buying and waves them at her
she laughs and waves her bras right back
civilians watching think theyre in love
quoyle and wavey stroll the grounds of nolans future retirement home
it is twilight and the modest place looks pleasant and welcoming
quoyle listens earnestly as the director points things out
wavey watching quoyle her gaze not so disapproving after all
close on quoyle with a bowling ball poised glaring our way
here he comes
reverse angle to see the ball rolling rolling real slow
quoyle turns his back strides away with confidence like he doesnt even have to watch this is too easy
wavey points look
he turns in time to see two pins fall
pumps his fist
its as romantic as urban newfoundland will ever get
our couple nursing beers at the corner table of a passably stylish bar
piano playing show tunes but soft
he pulls from his pocket
a travel brochure
slightly drunk completely merry almost wicked smile
now listen to this for tmorrow
after i sign the papers at the home
shes already grinning
feels so comfortable
quoyle reads the answer to your annual outing
rainbow trout fishing in four ponds
you pay for what you catch
prizes in the ponds
if it drizzles or gets chilly heated and lighted building available right next to the ponds with soft drinks candy bars ice cream and chips
his subtle smile
a guy could get used to this irony stuff
or we could sleep in
at some primal level his panic begins
i just feel so guilty about all your expenses
two separate rooms
both so big
hey its my treat
seems like we could figure out
has the message
he looks down at his beer as he thinks about what he should say
turns the glass in his fingers
a friend told me once
love is the only thing that counts
almost to himself
quoyle a murmur its the engine of life
he looks up
her eyes are waiting
so when you told me how you think about your husband
i really understood becau
thats what i wanted us to talk abou
because real love
just comes once
see you know some of the stories about petal
some of the bad things
what you dont know
but shes looking in his eyes
and so she does
wavey just above a whisper is how much you love her
thats what it is
she never loved you
because of it
the most miserable and the most honest he has ever been
all at once
isnt about whats good for you
isnt about what you wish it was
isnt about what
would make you happy
his eyes are swimming
can she possibly hear this
is about want
what you really want
and you cant change that
even if its poison
the piano plays something gay and stupid
so thats why its great
to have a real friend
the last word was a tough one
it makes her nod
she stares in his eyes for the longest time
and when she speaks he can scarely hear her voice
i know you have to stay tomorrow
to sign the papers
and even a stupid guy
gets it all
i should be heading back
he nods dumbly
watching his worst nightmare unfold before his eyes
and im not feeling so well
what i get for mixing vodka and beer huh
she gets to her feet
she does seem a little unsteady
so ill grab a taxi
you stay and finish
listen to the music
is that all right
but he stops
because shes shaken her head once
and dont worry
im still your friend
her voice chokes a little on that
she shakes her head half grinning at how foolish she feels
she smiles at him now
like she means it
without another word
she did stay my friend
in her way
even tho for awhile we didnt see each other a lot
he wants to cry
he wants to be sick
he doesnt know what he wants
fumbles in his pocket for some wadded up bills
how one little talk
can change everything
the boys the beers the squidburgers
tell me about it
just get the aunts house fixed perfect and i gotta move
three hours to drive from the point with all the ice
alvin wont have my boat ready til new years
agnis can stay over her shop
bunny and i have to find a room in town
stay with us
my kid follows yours around theyll bunk tgether
and we gotta fluffy couch thats moren you deserve
a good friend
quoyle is touched
hopin youd offer almost worth it just tinconvenience ya
unfortunately im too fond a yer wife
nutbeem casual take my trailer
the way he said that
they both turn
its two years
my boats ready
if i stay any longer ill begin to like it here
wouldnt want that
very silent at this table
against the din of the place
is he serious
nutbeem softly im throwing myself a farewell party on saturday
departure to follow sunday
regrets soon after no doubt
serious as a heart attack
a long beat
quoyle a murmur be careful
last friend left me
turned into a truck driver
so much feeling behind his eyes
nutbeem can only say
with that warning
and return the feeling
with his own
quoyle groaning under the weight of cases of beer and cheap rum pulled from the back of his wagon
plenty more to go
nutbeems tiny threadbare trailer
every conceivable surface under stacks of plastic wrapped party platters of cold cuts cheese and red eyed olives
nutbeem is jamming beers into tubs of ice
quoyle peers into the teensy closet that is the only bathroom
whats the barrel for
see it now
half a sawed off empty barrel with molasses stenciled in orange fills the shower stall
quoyle sends him a blank look
perfect for th chips
he gestures to thirty bags of potato chips filling the kitchenette
its coated with two kinds of scum
we forgot to buy dip
view out a window at the line of headlights still arriving
we are immersed in the ungodly white noise of an all gentlemans newfie soiree music pushed beyond the level of distortion assorted grunts squeals unintelligible words things breaking
as we struggle to look around
every square inch is crammed tight with semi conscious drunks
tert card and some boys circle the potato chip barrel which has become a handy urinal
near the door dennis holding forth arm tight around quoyle who listens listens chuckles
then quoyle fights his way
out of the trailer to cold night air where the party is much wilder given the elbow room
quoyle steps over the supine form o billy pretty who is singing to himself
finds jack buggit with a beer in one hand a rum in the other
wraps a drunken arm around jacks neck
starts to talk in his ear
jack looks suspicious
a fight breaks out a few feet away
they dont notice
closing in to hear
quoyle shouting against the din jack nods
thats pretty funny
is even funnier
jack is chuckling already
quoyle is chortling
but jack stares him dead in the eyes
at which point jack busts out laughing fit to wet his pants
pounding on poor quoyle who is also dissolved in hysterics
nearby the biggest and ugliest guy at the party no small distinction leaps onto a tree stump brandishing an axe
even in this crowd it commands a certain degree of attention
cries of yar
fill the woods
nutbeem himself is hoisted on shoulders whooping and sloshing his grog
an idea that wins immediate mass approval
soused nutbeems eyes open bug wide as he is borne in a tidal wave of mayhem toward the docks
whatever he is shrieking may well prove ineffective
and rather suddenly
quoyle is left alone
among the conscious that is
knitted wool the color of oxblood lies across a timeworn leather ottoman
in front of it little herry dances a shuffle foot jig of his own design
the music seeps from a venerable accordian played earnestly by his serious mom nodding and tapping her foot to the time of his steps
there is a feeling of empowerment and release in herry
his grin splits his round face
his eyes say that his heart is dancing
pull slowly back
through the window past the porch across the front yard
to a figure
by the fence
he stands motionless
except his foot is tapping very slightly to the time of the music
we cant tell how much quoyle sees
but his eyes say that his heart is drowning
as quoyle shuffles up we see nutbeems trailer has been turned completely over onto its side
walls are crushed and splintered
its a train wreck
sitting on the cinder blocks that once supported it nutbeem and dennis swig beers
nutbeem cheery youre looking dishy q
feeling that and more
whats the situation
nutbeem hands him a beer
youre moving in with dennis no matter how fond you are of his wife
quoyle looks sadly at the trailer
realizing it was his place that got trashed
nutbeem laughs and the boat
im some disgusted
with the human race
ida never made it anyway
storms would have blown me to bits
you boys saved my life
yes you did
the boys look at each other
humiliated by his generosity
ive gathered my savings and am flying to brazil
where water is swimming pool green
and i grill yellowtail steaks with lime and garlic watercress and tobasco
touch of curry
quoyle is looking at him somewhat strangely
quoyle light i collect friends who cook
just cant keep em
maybe too light not to be obvious
billy looks from quoyle to the trailer
its too bad
which seems to cover everything
quoyle alone with jack in open water
pulling on a slicker gloves picking up a knife
jack is pronging cod onto the deck
hands might as well be movin while we chat
always hated th sight a grown men around a table workin nuthin but their jaws
and so together they begin to clean a small mountain of cod
editorial meetin ysay
well tert cards gone fer one thing
doesnt look up
yar i know he never said gbye
well dont get all weepy eyed about it old son
try tbe a man
they called him from st
johns he tells me
wants him to help put out th newsletter fer them oil rig suppliers
he was sassy an he was smug
oh theres a waitin list he assures me
they only skims th cream
well dont get all weepy eyed abou
i was a wee help
bhind the scenes doncha know
jack quietly sometimes
enough is enough
no arguments arise
well billyll do a helluva job
jack nods right where he is
too old a fish tswim fastern be wants
gotta find someone a little dumber ttake on a shit job like this
you dont mean
spot im in christmas and all
might have to offer thmess
arguably the proudest moment of his life
id need a raise
jack looks at him for the first time
a real twinkle behind
yer do have the sense god gave a doughnut
quoyle genuinely touched iii try to live up to that
said with such sincerity jack can only nod
any other outrageous demands
seein as yer got me over a barrel
heres your one chance
and before he can stop his mouth
well your son
the mirth dies in his hosts eyes
like a watt bulb in a brownout
quoyle swallows the rest
you were sayin
quoyle sucks it up
his whole life would be changed
if he could come upon
a fishing license
flat and cold as the cod hes gutting
well theres only one a those issued per family
so how exactly would he do that
this is not
a dangerous silence
even doughnuts yknow
can push their luck
the day care contingent more organized today
bunny leading a spirited round of red light green light as
quoyle enters with a big cardboard box full of presents
as he shrugs off his coat he looks at the christmas tree its winking lights
the decorations that seem to be everywhere many handmade by these children
he watches bunny call out red light
only to have herry ignore it and tackle her anyway
mixed emotions to be sure
a feeling of family he can at least visit yet will never be his own
the sad edge catches up with him so he strolls on into
wavey baking what else
she smiles to see him
a friends smile
wavey southern belle why mistuh quoyle
you shouldnt have
he smiles back
takes her in for a telling beat before
most of these are for herry
they are on top
personally wrapped in his slightly bulging fine motor control challenged personal style
be sets them on the counter
you probly want to wait for christmas
meaning please dont
so she wipes her hands on her apron
lets him see her eyes dance just a flicker
oh im much too excited
delicately unwraps the first
lifts out a porcelain teapot finely painted with an assortment of berries
she holds it in her hands at once admiring and wistful
wondering if theres a message about their moment together while berry picking
its from a museum catalogue
but its not real
its a copy
wavey still gazing at it it is my favorite teapot
a simple pronouncement
she opens the second flat and narrow
it is a turquoise bracelet
actually kind of stunning
she blinks taken back by the beauty and perhaps the expense
its nice for your eyes
she doesnt sayanything
lets it dangle from her fingers catch the light
its for everyday
you dont have to save it for special
she looks to him
her eyes are shining maybe more than she wants
her voice perhaps softer than she even intends
oh ill save this all right
with only a slightly more than friendly smile
and ill think of you
when i put lot on
he can only nod
hed like that
she holds up one finger wait a second
and hurries off
so he waits
looking at her kitchen
feeling his feelings
she is back with two boxes
sets them down
nods go ahead
one is heavy and square
he opens it to find a leather bound case
he looks at her smiles in his childlike way
opens the case which reveals
two leather bound volumes
one a dictionary
the other a thesaurus
he is obviously moved
quoyle a murmur you must have me mistaken
for a writer
and when he looks up
i dont make mistakes
about that kind of thing
he stares at her long enough to make her nod toward the other package
big and flat but not heavy at all
he lifts the lid and pulls out
a huge comfy sweater
in oxblood wool
he is completely stunned to realize
wavey so pleased well you cant be surprised
youve seen me knitting it for months
it was so big i thought it was a tea cozy for your car
but if its for me it has to be bigger huh
put it on put it on
so he slips it over his head
big enough and then some
this worries her
she plucks at it
youll grow into it
after the holidays well have to stretch it
hes just beaming
hugs himself to show how warm it is
the silence is companionable
not used to a woman
giving me presents
she raises a brow
can scarcely believe that
one christmas with petal i gave her eleven things
and i wrapped them
and watched her open them up
she holds her friendly smile
but her eyes have changed
she didnt have anything for me
like every year
but this one time she said wait a minute
wait a minute
she ran to the kitchen
i heard the fridge open
she came back
with her hands hidden behind her
then she held out
even his voice
betrays the longing
two brown eggs
she gave them to me from her own hands
they were cold
he smiles self conscious
must sound really stupid
but they meant a lot to me
its the thought that counts
hes glad she understands
i broke em careful
made her an omelette with em
and i saved the shells
in a little box
she cant help but show her surprise at that
theyre on a shelf behind my desk
at the paper
he looks worried now
shouldnt have brought this up
and seeing this
i know how it is
to hold onto something good
in the middle of all the bad
but feels truly awkward now
i gotta collect bunny
beetys gonna have supper waiting
she understands this too
thank you very much
takes her teapot and her bracelet
a gentle barrier
her hands now too full for a hug
with a wonderful smile
with one of her own
quoyle enters a packed auditorium festooned for christs birthday with every trimming imaginable
rough fishermen in black jackets they wear once a year women in finery schoolkids at their well scrubbed best antsy with anticipation
the buzz is audible palpable
no broadway opening could hope for this level of eagerness
as quoyle comes down the aisle we see faces we know
boys from nutbeems party
billy pretty with jack and mrs
alvin yark and his bird like wife
the old timer who sold quoyle his boat
mavis bangs with an empty seat next to her must be saved for agnis
all the kids from daycare
still quoyle searching for the face he doesnt find
to the third row where dennis and beety have saved him a seat
beety gives him a peck on the cheek and he smiles settling in nervous as hell just as
the school principal still dressed for england walks to the mike at center stage
holds up her hands like the disciplinarian she prides herself on being and they quiet pretty fast
your friends and neighbors and most of all your children
have worked hard to bring you the best pageant ever
thunderous applause whistling stamping
she is frustrated for a moment
then waves cheerily against the din shouting
and runs off stage as we dissolve through a series of angles
the big ugly guy who led the raid on poor nutbeems boat stands in a threadworn suit bulging with his bulk singing danny boy in the sweetest tenor one could
pan an audience rapt motionless
pavarotti never had more respect
bunny and marty walk timidly to the front of the stage
marty dressed in christmas reds and greens
bunny all in blue which does look good on her
kids call out their names
the place falls quiet
and the girls begin to sing a plaintive west african hymn in small brave voices that sometimes harmonize
it is unexpected and breathtakingly courageous
two dads in the third row have tears flooding their eyes
dennis gruff whisper not bad my kid eh
quoyle gruffer whisper ill say
shes as good as mine
agnis hamm walks out alone onto the stage wearing a brown jersey tweed skirt yellow stockings and red slippers
she has an odd look on her face all serious and curious
the laughter and calls die away to silence
suddenly one of her feet scratches at the stage her arms become wings and with a crooning and cackling she metamorphoses into a peevish hen protecting an egg
the house comes down with laughter and unison applause
quoyle glances back at mavis bangs who puts her fingers between her teeth and whistles in pure delight
wavey prowse walks onto the rear of the stage in a long black smock carrying her accordion
she turns to the wings nods and out comes little herry clacking across the stage in tap shoes
a beat of silence
mom calls out one two three rolls into a savage hornpipe and herry commences the jig quoyle once glimpsed through a window
three hundred heels coming stomping down in perfect rhythm and lift herry into a joyous bouncing rattling performance that builds in intensity until the finish
he runs to the edge of the stage bows deep from the waist stands beaming in their applause
then races offstage his mom following with dignity and we go with her into the wings
once there wavey slips out of the smock revealing to the dimness of the wings that she is wearing dancers tights over drop dead legs
a close fitting tunic covered with sequins and glass bugles crystal diamonds and dozens more glittering baubles that send a shimmer of prisms with her every breath
herry hands her a top hat a cane and
she stalks back onto the stage her lithe body strutting and glinting
a hush of stupefaction falls only to be washed away by shouts and whistles the kind of which have not been heard since gypsy rose lee startled her first roomful
in the bedlam
she twirls the top hat on one finger flips it up in a double somersault catching it square on her head
she leans on her cane and when at last they quiet
we all know billy prettys ways
never save fifty cents if you can save a dollar
billy laughing loudest
well last febry billy wants tget his grandfather clock repaired
calls old leander mesher
twirls the cane recklessly
in the third row a goggle eyed quoyle couldnt blink if he tried
well says leander the big cost is pickup and delivery
got tcharge fifty dollars each way
two strong boys
air in the tires
theres no cost for air in yer tires
get wi thtimes hes told
tis called inflation
waggles her eyebrows groucho style
they are busting their guts laughing
connoisseurs of wit
billy lives at the top of the hill leander at the bot tom doncha know
so billy gets a rope hoists the grandfather up on his back
and muttering the words fifty bucks
she puts her toe out slips wildly windmilling her arms pantomiming as she bends double under the phantom clock
four feet thick a ice
tears are streaming from a hundred eyes and more
meanwhile at the bottom auntie fizzard years young sets out in her non slip galoshes and her cane with the rubber tip
didnt yer dearie
bows to the old gal in the front row who is scarlet faced in hysterics as all around her applaud
wavey becomes her inching along casting fierce glances right and left to warn the world
meanwhile at the top
she is billy once more beneath his burden her long legs stutter stepping to one side then the other slipping skidding the howling all around her threatening to shatter walls
over he goes clock side down and pickin up speed
miming the wild ride as they roar
eight blocks nine missing everything like a miracle zeroing in on
she becomes auntie fizzard once more shuffling looking left right and suddenly up wild eyed
clips er inta the snow bank
leaning on her cane
when at last they quiet
just two galoshes stickin outta the snow
she digs er way out
brushes herself off
looks at him sprawled like a turtle on his back tied to his massive burden
levels a dead eyed killer gaze
the place comes down like a house of cards
bedlam surrounds quoyle who sits still as a stone
too dazzled to breathe
lonely stretch of wooded road middle of nowhere
light snow just starting to fall
a truck pulls up beneath a tree
looking grim walking slow
crosses the road to a weathered diner
the woman who only smokes when shes worried pulls out a pack of camels
looks through the diners frosted window
a lone customer sits nursing his coffee
he is lean very attractive
dark hard eyes set into worries of their own
wavey lights up
watches in silence until
the man looks up
their eyes meet through the glass
and on his faint smile
she turns her back
starts up the road
he is walking beside her now
snow drifting lazy her smoke curling up
he watches her anger how cold and quiet and closed
smiles at her profile
i shoulda come last night
seen the show
she cant even believe he said that
never looking at him
woulda been a thrill for the christians among em
they think youre dead
his smile is gentle
well then we got good news for th
so does your son
even better news for him
wavey low you think so
breaking the words off
hes watching her profile
herold very soft i cant undo the hurt ive done
unless you let me
gauging the feeling behind the bitterness
theres a million reasons to send me away
and only two reasons not to
is she even listening
he lets the silence hang
i love you
and you love me
she stops walking
flips her cigarette off into the snow
looks into his face
rear angle of agnis crouching in the lightly falling snow
at the edge of the sea
the spot where she once sent her dog to rest
hear footfalls crunching slowly across the rocks
a bulky figure comes into frame
crouches down beside her
she stares at the gray horizon
quoyle softly mavis bangs
told me where youd be
but she hears him all right
we get so little mention in the wires
thought youd like to see
he hands the folded print out to her
head in the suitcase
the mysterys solved
she looks briefly at his eyes
starts to read
silver melville was captured in moored with a cruise steward
the boy was twenty a looker wearing armani clothes
driving a nice lexus
agnis keeps reading
says she did it all for love
she nods at that
folds the paper neatly as if conveying respect
hands it back
shed call me time to time
husband was a pig
more women should do what she done
he looks in her eyes
and decides to say
shoulda done it to their brother
the look holds
she sees the compassion in his eyes
knows hes so on her side
she clears her throat
agnis softly cousin nolan
hafta pay him a visit
they share a look
he glances at the sea
mavis said you buried warren here
called it an anniversary
she stares deep and unblinking into his eyes
she will tell him
of a loss
but not the dog
a held moment
what makes us do that nephew
give ourselves away to someone
so we cant eat or think or breathe without em
quoyle just above a whisper i dont know
we just do
wonderful aint it
and now she smiles
something we have rarely seen
irene warren died
the mornin after a christmas
we get one true love in life nephew
she was mine
hes not surprised
and that in turn does not really surprise her
dont mean we cant give love again
and get some back
for some it does
agnis straight back not for me
strong with that
and if that ruffles some small town feathers
his smile in return
yknow what the feathers around here need th most
a good ruffling i say
he sounds pretty sure himself
their look ho ds
yknow what i need th most
a really big breakfast
she nods one last time
sounds like a plan
quoyle alone with his cut and paste making up the front page layout
moonlight on fallen snow through the window
late enough quiet enough to hear
the vehicle drive up the engine turn off
the footfalls to the door which swings open
the last person hed expect to see
especially with a bottle
of cuervo gold
they stare at each other
only he smiles
she shoots him a quizzical look
we see the edge right off even if he doesnt
on the stage
shakes his head with innocent admiration
she puts the bottle on his desk
it was easy
i just kept thinkin
how would petal do it
he hears it now right enough
the anger the cuervo
she stalks on over to the coffee counter only a bit wobbly
plucks up two styrofoam cups
were friends right
friends drink together
back to his desk
shrugs her coat off onto the floor
pullover and jeans she looks terrific
hikes her butt up onto the edge of his desk
i asked a quest
quoyle quiet ill drink with you
if youre not done yet
her soft throaty laugh
he hasnt seen her this way
cant decide if its more scary or exciting
not drunk enough yet to talk about petal
which we always seem to do
opens the bottle
about four fingers are gone
lets talk about me
which we dont
pours herself another two
thinks before she says
growin up all i wanted from this place was out
give up all this
pours two fingers for him
stretches her body to slide the cup across the desk
the cuervo sloshes
i ran off to toronto went to school
wanted to be a social worker
shes looking at her cup now
not at him
came back one summer
fell for herold prowse
takes a swallow
closes her eyes
did you know i was a liar
opens her eyes
straight into his
herold liked other women
but you know how that is
sure you do
wavey whispers he didnt die
not that he didnt deserve to
a perfect stunned ox gape
see im a good liar
drains her cup
he ran off to seattle with some bitch
when his damaged son was two months old
and nobody knew
an ice cold wink
like i said
its four years ago
and its yesterday
pours herself another
savors the memory
so i took his boat out
i sunk it
and told my little story
shrugs a drunken careless shrug
i was leaving of course
why humiliate myself on the wayout
wavey softer but a funny thing happened
on my way out
her eyes are deeper now
and for a beat the anger slips away
all these funny odd little folks
they put their hearts around me
so i wouldnt be alone
having lost the man i loved
a real one
and since i knew to my shame that is exactly what i had lost
i let go of the will to leave
decided to let my child grow up
around folks better than his mom
stares in his eyes
youre quite the talker
quoyle quiet i take pride in that
so she smiles
but the bitterness is there in it
well this morning
the man i loved
and the world
ceases to spin
one mans world at least
she watches that
told me he knew
i loved him still
sips at her second drink
slides the rest of it down
now im drunk enough
to talk about petal
her eyes ask
youre thinking were kindred souls you and me
in love with our nightmares
shakes her head
you dont love your petal
means those words as an opening blow
jacks or better
here comes the hole card
you have to think its love
because if its not youre dead inside
so you keep that flame a flickering
cos its all youll ever have
youre a good liar too
lifts the cap
screws it back on the bottle
wheres the damn eggshells
thats all i came to see
and from his prison of shock and shame
he points to a shelf
she is off his desk like a panther
snatches the tiny padded box with its treasure
raises it high to smash it and
to see the panic
in his eyes
it brings tears
pooling in hers
and she sets the treasure down with the tenderness that decency requires
can you guess how i know about petal
because you and i
are kindred souls
is what she came to say
so i told my husband
to fuck himself
and the ego he rode in on
she crosses the floor
scoops up her coat
walks just a little wobbly to the door
thanks for the mirror
if i dont see you
happy new year
the door closes quietly
quoyle looks from it
to the eggshells
dennis and his wife beety bundled together asleep as a ferocious storm howls around the house
quoyle awake on the sofa in dennis parlor
clutching his blankets around him
eyes jumping with every shriek of the marauding wind
mind racing with thoughts of wavey
bunny asleep with dennis daughter marty
the room seems to vibrate under the violence of the weathers assault
close on bunny now and
her eyes open
a strange intent in them
she slips from martys bed in her thin blue nightdress
through the house in the dark as the wind screams its warning
into the par lor where her father sleeps as the wind suddenly invades and
sucks her straight up the chimney and out into the heart of the storm
sailing like a loosened kite out across the black water
out and out as gray light rises to
quoyle point where she is blown flat against a granite boulder just in front of the green house which shivers and pleads against the wind its steel cables straining and
suddenly from within the house lights come on
the white dog is in a window
no longer snarling and menacing but whining pitifully begging to be saved
and on the second floor
petal alone wild eyed with terror
she is dressed all in blue and her daisy chain necklace flies about her throat as she pounds against the glass her eyes staring directly at her daughter who can
only scream soundlessly against the gale as the house
begins to come loose the first cable snapping and whipping about with the fierce destructiveness of unleashed power then the next and another and with petal still visible howling in
horror windows bursting everywhere else like flash bulbs the house
slides free along the rocks toward the cliff bunny screeching as it goes over the edge tumbles down toward the sea and bunny
sits bolt upright in bed a single gasp as her dad is there holding her tight
she is soaked with sweat
but her eyes are not wild
they are filled with the knowing
bunny a whisper daddy
the green house is gone
he smooths her hair
the wind bellows in rage
little marty somehow sleeps on undisturbed beside her
bunny a whisper i didnt dream it
dont say i did
they climb from the station wagon into cold clear sunlight
stare in wonder at the naked rock
the snapped spent cables
only shards of wood and glass leaving a hapless trail toward the cliff
bunny runs toward the debris and through it
to a tangle of bushes near the cliff
he walks to a broken cable
his eyes running over the space
where his ancestors home once stood
quoyle calls out what you got there
we see now
bunny has unearthed a huge wooden crate from its hiding place
too engrossed in counting its contents to respond
as he comes over
bunny not looking up petals things
she is counting her treasure trove of necklaces
more than any sound mind could imagine
yet in their infinite variety somehow wonderful
a testimonial to the power of love
i think theyre all here
she looks up
sees him staring so fixedly at them
bunny alerted whats wrong
i never saw em
the kid doesnt smile
she decides whether to ask him
will she be proud to wear em
he looks in her eyes
his heart breaks behind his smile
any woman would
steel gray morning
the sea is more than a little rough as jack lays out his lobster traps
two other boats not too close by appear and disappear in mist
he is checking the lines knotting hefty weights onto the traps to take them down
jack sings to himself oh th gandy goose she aint no uuuuse cos all her nutsn bolts is
halfway to lowering the next trap over the side
jack mutters sweet jesus
im turnin inta alvin cockadoodle yark
as it nears the water line jacks cat skipper tom suddenly leaps down onto the trap
what is this
tries to let go of the trap and grab the cat in one motion but the cat jumps back to the boat jack stumbling out of his way steps in
the coiled line which whirrs as the trap goes
down the line strangling jacks leg and whipping him flailing over the side in one startling heartbeat
almost comic to watch
it is very quiet
air bubbles appear at the surface
in a few seconds
the water is unbroken
the boat bobs silently in the swells
quoyle and alvin inspect quoyles newly finished boat
it is a beauty to be sure and the old builder watches quoyle lovingly running his hand across the smooth gunnel
alvin doesnt smile
thats not his style
gotta paint the name
whatll it be
the tall and quiet woman
quoyle glances over
the old boys eyes are dancing
you knew billys dad
everbody knows everbody
but billys pap didnt invent the four women in a mans life
which one is bunny i wonder
the maid in the meadow mebbe
but yoda is just staring at him
theyre all the same woman
thats the point
his pupil blinks
like a crystal bullet of clarity his brain
the maid in the meadow thats her innocence and play
the stouthearted woman is when you need to lean on her
for some reason he could never name
tears are pooling in eyes
the tall and quiet woman
thats the silent partner who always walks longside sos yer never alone
quoyle is nodding now
it all seems so right
and the demon lover
thats just the frostin on th cake
a soft knocking at the door
when yfind the woman whos all four
thats when ygot yer one true love
the bird like woman enters
the old man nods toward her
but she isnt alone
a man enters behind her
it is dennis buggit
and there are tears on his face
he brings a dreadful silence with him because the face is an open grave
my dad went over the side this mornin
tangled in th sling stone line
a sob escapes from this strong mans throat
he ignores it
no one knows what to say
if you could write a memorial t him
fer tmorrows gammy bird
id be real grateful
the road is jammed with parked cars and trucks and vans and wagons folks still streaming toward the brightly lit house
everbody knows everbody
every room is filled with folks who wear their best
there is eating and chatter and even some pockets of laughter as we move through the crowd
as if some have taken hold of a wakes well meaning purpose
others stand dazed still wearing their pain and confusion
there are children here some hold a parents hand some giggle with each other
snapshot of a community
struggling to cope
quoyle and bunny enter holding hands looking around
as they cross the room
two figures step into their path
two women holding hands their bodies close together
their feeling for each other open for all to see
one is agnis
and the other
isnt mavis bangs
happy new year mr
im sorry i missed you at the pageant
slightly startled quoyle cant help but smile despite the solemn occasion
at the proud look on his aunts face
i was in the wings a course
wasnt our girl somethin
our girl a course is agnis
who nearly blushes at the compliment
i say yhave tlove a woman
whos in touch with her inner chicken
well who could argue with that
dawn leans up kisses quoyle on the cheek
and with surprising softness
hes not sleeping in the box
her great aunt looks at this child
bends to plant an unexpected kiss on the top of bunnys head
the kid squirms tugs her dad firmly off as he sends a parting wave
into the parlor now
quieter here as the new arrivals thread past jack buggit in his open coffin resting on black draped sawhorses
dennis and his mom stand by jack a hand and a word for each
and moving into the line
remember what i told you
his words a murmur
hers are bolder
if hes not sleeping
why do they call it a awake
as if it is a worthwhile question
were the ones have to be awake
to how much we love him
nods to himself
and how we should be good to each other
while we have the chance
he looks down
they are almost there
she is thinking
keeping the thoughts to herself
at the coffin now he lifts her up to see
jack lies motionless a wax figure of himself
serene behind violet eyelids
he looks like hes sleeping
dennis looks over
his stolid grim face releases a smile for his friend
thats cos hes peaceful
no worries anymore
he sets her down
and from his pocket
i found this in jacks drawer at the paper
i dont know if its somethin special
an enameled wreath with the initial r backed by a long sharp pin she tears up again just to see it
oh its his lodge pin
we were lookin all over
she smiles bravely as she takes it
leans up to kiss his cheek
buggit a whisper dennis showed me what ywrote fer th paper
did jack proud
so they look at each other
dennis clears his throat looks away
and then quoyle is leading bunny off
petals peaceful too
just a statement of fact
to no one in particular
dad squeezes her hand
you can count on tha
but she lets go
scampers to a corner of the room
to herry prowse
and his mom
so quoyle starts toward her his heart in his throat
and when wavey looks up
she is glad to see him
as he reaches her
she holds up her wrist
dangling from it her turquoise bracelet she wore her best for jack
quoyle stands very close
one last thing from his pocket
new years present
a small box
wrapped as careful as he could
she looks to his eyes really
its a quoyle tradition
well in that case
she takes it into her slender fingers
undoes the ribbon the paper
lifts the lid to see resting in tissue
crushed almost to powder
her heart comes straight to her eyes even before the whispered
for the mirror
and across the room mrs
buggit leans with trembling hands to fix the lodge pin to jacks lapel
shaking as she is the hand lurches the big pin goes plunging and
a rattling cough
rolls across this room
the world falls silent
jacks wife grabs her sons arm and their eyes bug out staring into the box
and lunges to help hs gurgling father free his shoulders from the coffins wedge
a sudden roar there are screams there is even laughter and whistling complete chaos
and in the bedlam a tug on quoyles coat
he woke up
sunlit day of crystal perfection
the majesty of ice and towering rock and shimmering water
a scale so majestic any cynic would be hard put to deny gods hand
and gliding into frame
a tiny skiff
on its maiden run
we close to see
painted on its side
the four women
one woman is rowing just now doing all the work
her son sleeps in the bow
and in the middle of the little boat
father and daughter
are unpacking the picnic lunch
there is a lot of food
this could take awhile
thats a funny thing to say
for the first thing he said
im keepin mdamn lobster license
maybe he just said it
to make your uncle dennis laugh so hard
she keeps unpacking
her face quiet and serious
her thoughts her own
quoyle very softly its not fair is it
that jack woke up
and petal didnt
and since hes said her thought aloud
she tells him
the worlds not fair
shes not looking up
but he knows shes listening
thats something the world is always teaching us
and sometimes the learning comes later
that gets through
both adults can see it
quoyle a murmur you taught me that
eyes resolutely down she nods
what we wait for
its like the main stem of this boat
it gives us our shape
her brow furrows
doesnt understand that
see i know why you saved a place for petal
all this time
she looks up
her dad is smiling from his eyes
cos im the daddy
and you learn how to do
by watching me
you just watched
better than i knew
still holding bunnys eyes
he beckons to the woman rowing
cmere a second
so wavey sets down her oars
and quoyle whispers to his daughter
he leans his face
to waveys mouth
a kiss so tender even a child cant turn away
the moment lingers
and when it ends
im thanking your daddy
for all my presents
there was only two
wavey looks at this girl
more than two
everything i need
she gathers all the courage it takes to say
except a necklace
we can feel her heart pounding in her throat
bunny stares back with eyes no one could read
i got a box of em
you could pick one
a hush over this bay
a woman stunned and grateful
then youd have everything you need
well that seems true
so the woman nods
her eyes flutter down
in the silence she unwraps a sandwich
wavey a murmur you want the cheese
she hands that one to quoyle
and as she and bunny look for another we pull
up and away an aerial angle swirling above the shimmering bay
the boat so far below us
the people tiny specks
they could be anyone
anyone at all
