original screenplay by william hjortsberg nd draft revised march huge trees taper upward like columns supporting the roof of heaven
moonlit dewdrops spangle a delicate spiderweb
the setting is tranquil and utterly majestic
over the brow of a distant hill a pair of brilliant light beams scintillate in an etheral ballet
numerous small animals gather to behold this wonder
they stand on the hillcrest staring down as if at the nativity
squirrels quail hedgehogs mice pheasants and badgers natural enemies untied by the radiant light
a magnificent stag watches numbers of tiny songbirds perched in his branching antlers
pull back from the hilltop through ferns and brambles to a steep embankment where umbrella sized toadstools cluster
a snarling face appears under a mushroom cap
this is blix a brigand goblin hunter
clad in decrepit armor and slung with savage weapons he is a terrifying figure
the sound is unexpectedly lovely a nightingales call
further back three other goblins return the birdcall
they bristle with weaponry
pox is a pig faced fop wearing tattered lace and flithy brocade
tiny blunder and tic are both masked by grotesque helmets
swarms of gnats drone above their hidden heads
they creep forward to join blix
the distant animals silhouetted by dazzling light
blix signals an advance and the goblins creep through the forest towards the hilltop
a moth lands on a twig two feet from tics head
his incredibly sticky tongue uncoils from within the helmet seizing the moth and retracting with it quick as a flash
as the goblins near the hilltop the fantastic light gradually illuminates their hideous features
a tiny mouse runs out of the eye slits on blunders helmet circles the crest and runs back in on the other side
blix signals silently for the other goblins to spread out
the goblins crawl separately through the underbrush
pox comes snout to snout with a wild piglet
terrified the little shoat squeals and scampers off
alerted by the noise they face the impending threat
the startled animals run for cover down the hillside
blix charges forward brandishing his crossbow
blix runs over the top of the hill and down into the gully beyond closely followed by tic pox and blunder
brilliant clumps of forget me nots are everywhere like disgarded jewels
the pair of shining light beams race away between the trees
the goblins watch the light beams disappear
blix growls in frustration
fast as a hound dog with his ass on fire
blunder spots a shining silver hair caught on the bark
he reaches up and plucks it free
pox whats that
l l let me see old chap
blunder hides the hair behind his back but pox quickly grabs the other end
pox give it to m m m me
both goblins pull on the hair
miraculously it does not break but stretches between them like spun steel
blunder turn loose anus features
pox hard cheese
a furious tug of war
pox pulls his knife and tries unsuccessfully to cut the hair
blunder its mine you rectum
blix marches up and furiously bangs their heads together
pox and blunder fall dazed to the ground
blix holds the silver hair shining above his head and studies it
blix disgusting and pure like a prayer
there be magic in this hair
the beast ran off faster and faster
we must take this to our master
an incredible landscape fantastically contoured hills rise above the monnbright mist
the four goblins dismount tie up their devil steeds and disappear over the brow of a hill
the goblins scramble down a steep hillside towards a desolate wasteland below
a mysterious malevolant shape looms on the far horizon
a miasmic jurassic swamp
stunted trees rise like amputated limbs from the fetid water
the goblins pick their way across the bog towards a distant island stepping from submerged logs to crumbled chunks of masonary to floating lily pads
a cracked marble plinth juts out of the water
the goblins creep by a towering skeletal statue playing a bone violin
a v shaped ripple undulates past them like the wake of a submerged crocodile
blix unhooks a dead rat from his game belt and tosses it from his game belt and tosses it onto the scummy surface
there is an angry swirl and it is gone
blix waves the goblins on and they climb onto a huge root twisting out of the water like a petrified serpant
the ominous wake cruises back and forth like a shark
blunder follows its progress with fear widened eyes
blunder wish i was still a leprecaun
stay clear of nasty places like this and do nothing all day but sing and dance and guzzle wine in the sunshine
furious blix turns on him his finger to his lips
unchastened blunder whirls on pox and repeats the gesture blunder shhhh
pox follows suit with tic pox shhhh
not to be outdone tic turns to silence whoever might be behind him
hairy meg mucklebones rises out of the bog huge and hideous
the water hag is half corpse half serpant
she seizes tic and disappears beneath the foul surface
the goblins final cry trembles in the chill night air
blix pox and blunder are terrified
they scramble over the twisted root in a wild panic leaping onto a floating log
the log rolls beneath their frantic feet
they barely keep their balance
pox frog spit
blunder snail sperm
blix all together
now or never
the goblin co ordinate like tiny lumberjacks running in unison
the rolling log drifts forward
pox j j jolly good
team spirit and all that
the log runs against the island and the goblins hop ashore
an enormous blasted tree crowns the ruins of a forgotten castle
tangled roots grip the anicient stones like the tenacles of a malformed sea monster
an atmosphere of eternal evil hovers over the site
the goblins stare back across the bog
blunder poor tic
blix growling with anger forget tic
less is always more
pox better we spilt three ways than four
blix hurries up the crumbling steps
pox and blunder follow
the steps lead under gigantic twisting roots
blix finds a small opening and slips inside
pox and blunder like this less and less but follow their leader without complaint
the three goblins tumble down a steep slope
the giant tree is a vast hollow stump open to a moonlit sky surrounding a smaller tree transfixed by a curved bronze horn an instrument of unspeakable evil
pox and blunder stare up like open mouthed tourists
blix is impatient
blix boost me
we must sound the summons before the dawn
the three goblins form a teetering ladder with blix wobbling at the top and blunder crushed at the bottom
blix blows into the horn with all his might
suddenly he breaks wind
pox and blunder grimace
blix blows again into the horn
there is no sound
dead leaves and dust puff out of the bell followed by three squealing bats
the supporting goblins wobble
pox steps on blunders head
blix blows a third time into the great horn
the unholy sound reverbarates like the wailing of all the doomed souls in purgatiory
as the evil sound moans the forest creatures react with terror
squirrels rabbits and mice dart fearfully for cover
birds flock to their nests
only the night creatures the wolves weasels and owls perk up thier ears to listen
the three goblins cower terrified among the gnarled roots
blunder now what
blix we sit
that be our fate
the goblins wait up on the upper platform of the ruined castle
blix sits apart from the others staring out across at the bog
the light of a campfire casts their shifting shadows against the huge trunk of the hollow tree
blix plays with the silver hair
blix to himself moving silent like the breeze
soft as shadows still as trees darkness be in all we sees
he lives in silence he lives in fire he lives in all thats dark and dire
a mysterious floating shape approaches out of the distance
it is a black cloak wafting through the mist like an airborne manta ray
the flying cloak wraps about the statue of the skeletal fiddler
the wind presses it tight revealing the skull through the cloth
suddenly the statues head turns to look at the great tree
blix walks to to the edge of the platform peering into the night
blix look in the gloom search out the tomb
that be where you find our sire
the pedestal is empty
the statue of the fidder has vanished
blix gets down on his knees genuflecting toward the the open bog
the black shadow of the lord of darkness falls across him
darkness towers over the ruined castle platform a huge horned figure drpaed in bacl cloth
an awesome silence ensues
blunder and pox kneel heaping ashes and dirt upon thier heads
blix hail o great one
divine and dark
strong like a lion swift like a shark
blix offers the silver hair up to darkness
blix though im not worthy of the task great lord i found this for your amusment
blunder leaps to his feet and grabs the hair from blix
blunder dont listen to them mealy mouthed lies boss
im the one who found it
blunder the bold
there is a bight flash of light
blunder howls with pain
blunder stares at his arm in dismay
his hand is gone magically replaced by a grotesque birdclaw
blunder stunned thank you lordship
blunder experimently clenches and unclenches his new bird claw
pox quite stylish actually
darkness dangles the shining silver hair in front of him
blix in the woods six leagues back tween twin oaks and the dragons track
darkness did my bold hunters chance to see quarry which cast this spoor
blix i stalked it sire but much too slow what beast it be i do not know
darkness this hair is from an angel of light
it comes this way rarely
i must have this creature
blix oh divine dark one teach us how to catch this creature
pox your instruction would be m m most ap p preciated
i wants to learn
i craves knowledge
darkness no trap of yours will work
there is only lure for such disgusting goddness
one bait which never fails
blix name the bait lord
a beautiful flower spangled meadow alive with songbirds
baby rabbits frolic in the tall grass where industrious squirrels forage for acorns and nuts
a delicate fawn gambols under the watchful eye of the doe
clouds of multi hued butterflies swirl overhead
waist deep in flower a young princess skips singing across the meadow
her name is lili
she wears splendid brocades and carries a bouquet wrapped in a lace napkin
like these blossoms she is beautiful and fresh and innocent
tiny birds fly down and land on her head and shoulders
she laughs as a warbling wren takes a seed from her lips
lili singing come down sparrow sing me good morning
rise up sun light the arch of the sky
living river turn light to diamonds when i look in my true loves eyes
lili runs towards a distant thatched roofed cottage
blix pox and blunder hide behind a boulder watching the girl
blix whipering darkness say the perfect lure always be a virgin pure
the woodcarvers wife is hangin up the washing when lili sneaks from behind the cottage
grinning micheviously lili unfastens one end of the clothes line and lets it drop
the laundry flutters onto the new mown grass a sheet drpaes around the outraged wife
wife dad blamed faeries
the cottage is snug and homey with smoke blackened beams and hand pegged furniture
a woodcarver sleeps by his bench surrounded by wood shavings and roughed out toys
lili steps into the sunlight streaming through the open doorway
her beauty is etheral an angel descending
finches peck at newly made tarts laid on a trestle table to cool
they rise to the rafters as at lilis approach
the princess peeks around the room
she tiptoes to the hearth and lifts the stewpot lid dipping a finger in for a taste
spying the tarts she grabs one and eats it hurriedly leaving a telltale crumb on her upper lip
the clock tolls the hour
a carved wooden maiden piroettes from the interior pursued by a skeletal fiddler playing a bone fiddle
lili is fancinated
the woodcarvers wife enters
she curtsies to the princess
wife god bless your highness
a royal visit is ever a joy
lili ive not come to visit nell wife wont you stay for a tart
nell pulls a tray from the oven
wife cont theyre fresh baked
lili ive no time today
wife teasing the princess must have a sweetheart waiting
wife surely the king forbids such folly lili what my father doesnt know wont hurt him
wife the wilful heart invites despair like blind men creeping in a dragons lair
with nells back turned lili steals another tart hiding it among the flowers in her bouquet
lili neither country provebs nor kings command can keep me out of the woods today
wife then its common sense ought
these woods be thick with spriggen and banshee
lili is that why youve hung a bell over the door
wife aye and spread the floor with flax and salt
my babe wont be stole by faeries
the princess starts merrily for the sun bright doorway
lili laughing more salt nell
youll worry yourself to death if youre not careful
lili runs out like a naughty child
the woodcarvers wife leans against the door jamb and calls after her wife beware of toadstool rings and willow trees
stay away from old oaks
hiding behind a moss coverd log blix pox and blunder watch princess lili run singing through the woods oblivous to any sign of danger
blix scowling may be innocent
may be sweet
aint half as nice as rotten meat
a lovely glade surrounded by tall trees breathlessly lili runs in from the woods
she is familair with this spot
it is her trysting place lili calling jack
i know youre here
lili looks around in exasperation
behind her something wild and mysterious swings through the trees like an animal
lili cont jack
where are you
lili is apprehensive at getting no reply
she hears the rustle of the leaves but does not see the sun dappled figure leaping from limb to limb overhead
lili frightened cont oh jack
please say something if youre here
jack o the green a legendry green man who lives the free life of a hermit in the woods drops down from a tree behind the princess landing without a
he is barefoot about sixteen and wears woven ivy leaves and skins
startled lili screams
lili cont jack
you scared the life out of me
jack says nothing staring at her shyly
lili hands him the flowers
a jay flies down out of the greenery and lands rasping on jacks shoulder
he imitates the bird expertedly the jay answers him in english jay she brings a gift as fair as herself
lili laughs it all seems magic to her
lili youre so clever jack
see what you can find in the flowers
jack pokes in the bouquet and discovers the stolen tart
he stuffs it immediately into his mouth
jay sweets from the sweet
jack i know someone sweeter
concealed behind the trees blix pox and blunder watch the green man and the princess wander down a meandering path
pox picks a spider from his web pops it in his mouth and crunches it down with a happy smile
several birds perch on jacks head and shoulders
squirrels rabbits and hedgehogs play about his feet
jack feeds them nuts and berries from his pouch answering their chatter expertedly
jack understands the language of all wild creatures
when a frisky wren flies warbling overhead lili hesitantly returns its call
jack that was very good
lili teach me rabbit like you promised
jack rabbit is much harder than wren
lili let me try
im a very good student
my father thinks im brilliant
lili toys with the silver madallion pendant she wears causing reflected sunlight to shine in jacks eyes
lili cont see how brilliant i am
jack laughing stop it
i cant see
lili dont i dazzle you with my wisdom
lili seems to glow with sunlight
jack stares at her rapt with love
jack much more than wisdom dazzles me
lili laughs and hangs her madallion around his neck
lili then teach me rabbit
jack not today
theres something really special i promised to show you
lili delighted oh jack
do you mean it
jack if it pleases you
lili more than anything
jack this is their season
they wont pass here again for a long long time
if you want to see them you must do everything i tell you
lili i swear
on my honour
jack im taking you to a very special place
its sort of sacred
nobody but me knows where it is and well
lili impatient what
jack unwraps the lace napkin from lilis bouquet
jack youll have to wear a blindfold
lili coyly dont you trust me jack
jack ill always trust you lili
jack holds lilis hand leading her blindfolded along a path through the woods
distant thunder rumbles
jack storms coming
lili who cares
havent you a cosy place to hide
jack many places
none fit for a princess
lili in these woods you are the prince jack
i am only a pauper here
jack turns to face a radiantly smiling lili
he bends towards her closer and closer and for a moment seems about to steal a kiss
she waits smiling sensing what is about to happen
in the end jacks innoncence and timidity get the best of him and he turns away
without his knowledge lili lifts a corner of the blindfold and mischievously peeks
the three goblin peer around a mossy trunk
did you see what he was gonna do
makes me want to puke
blix i swear by all the bats above nothings quite so foul as love
a sun glided amphithtre within the darker confines of the forest
sparkling like a ribbon of diamonds a stream flows down the middle
jack leads lili out of the woods and unties the napkin from around her eyes
lili aewstruck oh jack
some time has passed
lili is uncomfortable and restless
lili how much longer
jack be patient
lili kneels by the bank of the streem cupping water into her hands
jack stops her from drinking
lili im thristy
jack points at a huge viper moving sinously along the bank
jack its poisened the brook
no animal will drink here now
lili indignant i want some water
lili dont tell me to be quiet
im a princess
jack pulls lili back into hiding
jack very softly just watch
true royalty approaches
the radiant light beams gleam through the trees
a moment later a splendid white unicorn moves down the hillside to the edge of the stream
this is a stallion
he holds his head proudly
his mate stands at the edge of the woods
lili os ohh
theyre so beautiful
the unicorn dips his horns into the stream
jack os the alicorn purifies the water
the stallion watches his mare approach to drink
she is slighter and more delicate but every inch as mignificent
jack cont os theres no creature with more power or magic
as long as they roam the earth evil cannot harm the pure of heart
the three goblins crouch hiding
blunder disgusted ugly one horned mules
the princess is entranced
lili such grace
can you speak their language
jack a little
its very hard
unicorns talk only of love and laughter
dark thoughts are almost impossible for them to express
lili oh jack
i must touch one
jack alarmed no
lili i want to
jack restrains the princess when she attempts to get up from hiding
jack it is forbidden
these are sacred animals
lili nothing is forbidden me
jack dont ever say that
you risk your immortal soul
lili pulls free and steps into the clearing
lili you sound like my confessor
i only want to touch one
the princess strides defiantly into the open meadow
the unicorns watch the girl from across the stream
they snort and paw the ground
lili stands alone holding her arms to the unicorns
lili singing like a child feels watching a rainbow
like a brid feels the first time it flies i feel magic stirring within me when i look in my true loves eyes
the stallions nostrils flare
his strong neck arches
sunlight gleams on his horn as he charges
from lilis pov the stallion is terrifying as he thunders towards her acroos the stream
the stallion rears and prances racing around the princess as if drawn foward on an invisable lead
jack watches from the underbrush his outrage tinged with more than a touch of jealously
blix pox and blunder peer from their hiding place
evil leers brighten their impish features
pox whipering m m might as well be fish in a barrel
one would hope for a t t touch more sp p port
blix clamps his hand over poxs mouth
shut your yap
the lureof the virgin is too strong for the unicorn to resist
lili makes no move as the trembling stallion stands before her the rapier tip of his horn pressed against her breast
it is obvious he could kill her is an instant
the princess calmly reaches out and caresses his muzzle
lili singing when the darkness falls like a curtain and the rivers and streams turn to ice i have summer and daylight forever when i look in my true loves
across the stream the mare paces back and forth obviously agitated
blix pulls a long black flute from his quiver
he takes a dried hornet from a black snail shell with a hinged lid and slips it into his flute aiming the instrument like a blowgun
take your time
blix silences the foolish golbin with a ferocious scowl
his cheeks puff
there is a soft phut of expelled breath
the poisened hornet sails the air and strikes the hornet on the haunch
stung the unicorn bolts through the clearing disappearing into the undergrowth with the mare hard on his heels
the princess stands be confused and bewildered
distant thunder disturbs the tranquility
jack rushes to lilis side
lili oh jack it was so lovely
like a dream
jack angry youre lucky it wasnt a nightmare
lili dont be such a scold
come ill chase your fears away
the princess takes jack by the hand and leads him from the clearing
the unicorns plunge through brambles and fern clumps
leaping a deadfall log the stallion stumbles
he struggles to his feet and continues running
the three goblins gallop pell mell on their devilish steeds
there is nothing comical about them now
jack and lili sit atop a high promontory jutting over a crystalline pond
lili sweet william did a hunting go in the wood where faeries dwell
from dawn to dusk roamed he to and fro lost o lost all under thier spell
the stallion stagger his gait increasingly unstable as the poisen takes effect
the mare nuzzle his flank where the envenomed hornet struck
it is a virulent ound red and swollen
the war like shouting of the goblins grows even closer
the unicorns pause at a fork in the trail
the stallion motions with his head
sadly the mare compreheads and flees down the divergent path to safetly
the stallion stands his ground
when the three goblin hunters gallop towards him he turns and limps into the woods
jack lies beside lili listening raptly to her poem
lili reciting came he at last to where bluebells grow he heard them ring tis true to tell
he lay him down and did not know the flowers sound was his own death knell
and while he slept came teh lady fair and gathered him up behind her saddle
now all young hunters of bluebells beware sweet william rode straight through the gate of hell
jack is lost in lilis smile
jack when i get to heaven i know just how the angels will sound
lili enjoying it do you flatter all the girls like that jack
jack embaressed its the truth
lili kisses jack sweetly
he doesnt respond
lili smiling are you afraid of my kiss
jack im afraid youll break my heart
lili then still your heart
you are dear to me as life itself
jack only because i amuse you
like some trained bear
lili thats not true
i do love you jack
you must believe me
jack and if i so
no good can come from it
i am only a green man without land or title
no name or wealth to bring you
the princess her golden ring on and off her finger
lili what does it matter
i dont care about any of that
jack but it does matter
if not now
what about when the time comes for you to marry
lili i want to marry you
jack thats impossible
lili not if its what you really want jack
lili shows jack her ring
lili cont dont you wish this was our wedding ring
jack what if i say yes
will my wish come true
lili it is my right as a princess to set a challenge for my suitors
lili throws her ring high over their heads
it glitters through the air tumbling over and over in the long drop to the pond
lili cont i will marry whoever finds this ring
the ring spalshes into the cnetre of the pond
jack strips off his leafy cloak and dives headlong from the cliff
sweat streaked the unicorn staggers out of the tree onto a sweeping green meadow brilliant with pink bloosoms
froth bubbles on his nostrils
his wide azure eyes betray his panic
the goblins ride onto the flower bright meadow
they jump down from their mounts in a frenzy
blunder excited we got him now
we got him now
the stallion stumbles forawrd making a last futile effort to attack the goblins
limbs leaden head hanging the noble animal settles against a sapling and slides to the ground
thunder rumbles overhead
a wild wind whips the pink blossoms into the air
the golden ring drifts down tumbling in a lazy spiral
jacks pale form stabs through the crystal water
the distant glint of the sinking ring lures him on
the ring settles into the mud at the bottom concealed by waving weeds
jack searches blindly as clouds of silt billow about him
the three goblins advance towards the fallen unicorn through a pink blizzrd of wind blown blossoms
the black clouds boil and crash thunderheads mounting one upon another in a dark maelstrom
the goblins stands around the fallen unicorn
blunder turns away as pox seizes the end of the alicorn lifting it off the ground
blix swings an evil battle axe high up over his head
jagged lightning splits the raging darkness as the black blade falls
blix waves the severed alicorn in triumph
the whirling pink petals turn instantly into white snowflakes
apolcalyptic winds scream through the forest
the world is plunged into winter darkness
lili clings to a tree trunk
lili in desparation jack
the princess cant maintain her grip
the icy blasts knock her to the ground and she crawls to the cliff edge
lili cont screaming jack
the her horror lili sees a skin of ice form over the surface of the pond
lili cont sobbing oh dear god
fighting the raging winds lili stumbles to the pond and pounds on the ice in frustration
it is no use
got to get help
frantically lili runs off into the storm whipped woods
jack turns and looks up at the dark surface
he storkes upwards only to bump his head into something solid at the top
the pond is covered by a sheet of ice
jacks contorted face is seen through the ice
he breaks the frozen surface with his fist and his gasping head thrusts into the air
jack shouting lili
his words are lost on the wind
winter shrouds the tiny homestead
immobile goats chickens and ducks stand silent as snow statues in the farmyard
lili runs from the frozen forest and stumbles up the cottage steps
the princess barges in wild eyed and distraught
frost rimes the walls and furnishings
everything glisten like sugar candy
the woodcarver and his wife are frozen solid
lili touches the wifes gelid cheek
lili is shocked to discover the wife is frozen
the princes throws herself sobbing across the bed
sounds of snorting and shouting come from outside lili scratches the frost off the window pane in the sleeping alcove
the noisy goblins ride up on a makeshift sleigh of lashed animal bones
they stop outside and clamber out
blix has the alicorn tucked under his arm
terrified lili runs wildly across the cottage and clims the ladder to the loft
barrels and chests are stored here
cured bacon and hams hang from the rafters
lili hides in a corner with several twig brooms and a butter churn
she wraps herself in an old quilt snatched from an open trunk
snows blows in through a hole in the roof covering the floor timbers
three inch gaps between the planks permit a view into the cottage interior
the front door slams open and the goblins stumble laughing inside
blix mortal world turned to ice here be goblins paradise
blunder sinks his handaxe onto the kitchen table as he saunters past the frozen tarts
blunder lots to eat
pox runs forward to the cradle and seizes the frozen baby baring his tusks for the feast
pox i s s simply adore m m milk fed meat
blunder whatre you
some kinda animal
horrified lili gasps os in the loft
the goblins cock their ears to listen
pox snarls and drops the baby back in the cradle
curious blunder starts up the ladder to the loft but changes his mind half way more interested in what blix is doing
blix why eat cold
its better hot
blix points the alicorn at the frozen stewpot on the hearth
it begins to steam and bubble magically boiling without a fire underneath
pox am m mazing
how did you d d d do that old ch ch chap
blix is equally surprised by the alicorns power
he cackles and aims it at the clock on the mantle
the clocks hand spin wildly around backwards the carved figures darting in and out at fives times their normal speed
blix launches on an orgy of destruction waving the alicorn like a magic wand
plates shatter the cradle rocks
furniture topples toby mugs come wailing alive painted wooden toys dance and caper
the goblins shriek with impish joy
lili watches the havoc through the gaps in the floor
blix points the alicorn straight up
snow flies wildly around the crouching princess
the broom and the butter churn begin a mad dance across the crowded loft
it is all the princess can do to keep from screaming
as a grand finale blix points at nells frozen figure blowing her skirts above her waist
pox languidly m m most amusing blix
most terribly amusing
blunder this is sure our lucky day
killed that ugly one horn dead as a cowplop on a birthday cake
blix prattle prattle like a priest
pointing to himself it was me who shoot the beast
pox without the p p princess for bait youd never gotten close
b b beauty brought the b b beast to bay
blunder shes so sweet
i could eat her brains like jam
lili slumps against the wall aghast at what shes just overheard
blunder and pox fill a sack with frozen tarts
pox id like such her b b bones
blix points the alicorn at the cottage door
it flies open with a blix better hurry
cant be late
blix marches out of the door
the other two goblins follow darrging their sacks of tarts
blunder when we deliver that horn pox ol buddy darkness gonna give us a humongous big reward
blunder and pox leave slamming the door behind them
after a long pause lili creeps sobbing down the ladder from the loft
lili oh god
the princess stumbles across the cottage towards nell
lili cont what have i done
i didnt want the unicorn to die
all i did was touch it
lili pleads with the frozen wife as if begging for her forgiveness
she is interrupted by the gruff voice of a house brownie
brownie os youre a wicked wicked girl
lili looks up and sees a long bearded brownie standing next to the clock on the mantle
brownie the world is in a fine mess because of you
i brownies pov lilibr lili desperately ill make it somehow
i swear it
i dont care what happens to me
bolds deeds be needed now
look at you
pampered and soft
never done a days work in your life
lili os who are you
im the house brownie
i keep dust devils under the bed and all the china cracked
you know how a watched pot never boils
i do that
and im a wizard at turning sweet milk sour
the front door crashes loudly open
little blunder swaggers into the cottage
lili covers her face with the quilt and holds herself rigid as if frozen
the brownie ducks out of sight
blunder stalks to the kitchen table and pulls his axefree
he does a double take on spotting the princess
the tiny goblin cant remember cant remember if he saw her earlier or not
he pokes her and lifts her skirt to peek at her legs
he is stopped short by blixs angry cry outside blix os blunder
move your butt
on the double
blunder hurries to the door
lili relaxes when she hears it slam
lili thank god
lili looks up at the mantle
lili cont sobbing can you
brownie can i what
lili os help me
brownie sadly id like to
but im a domestic sort of chap
no good at all where demons are concerned
lili then ill do it myself
ill follow those goblins
even if it costs my life
brownie i like your spirit
theres always hope when a brave heart back a noble cause
but what chance have you
they have the alicorn
the power is theirs
the princess resolutely hurries about the cottage gathering things to eat and other useful items
lili i will do it
i fooled them now didnt i
well ill do it again easy as pie
lili starts for the door
brownie os wait
lili turns back
the brownie pulls a golden feather from his cap and tosses it down to lili
brownie tis from the tail of the cockatrice
make you as fleet as a running deer
and better when things seem at their darkest twill remind you always that hope is alive
the princess tucks the feather into her bodice
lili thank you
hope is just what i need
lili rushes from the cottage back into the snow
a full scale blizzard drives down through the naked tree limbs
jack slogs forward near frozen
jack calling lili
jack sees a tiny bird frozen solid on a branch
he takes it tenderly down trying to warm it with his breath
jack cont whats happened
standing rigid all around him are numbers of frozen animals
he can do nothing for the bird and trudges on into the storm
jack cont calling lili
up ahead the figure of a man is barely discernible
jack runs to the man thinking himself saved
jack discovers the man is frozen like the bird
his initial shock gives way to releif
the man is his salvation after all
quickly he unties the strangers travel bags and cloak
jack cont god rest your soul
i know you wont mind if i borrow your things
jack wraps himself in the claok and finds a tinder box in the travel bag
he scrapes together a pile of twigs striking sparks with the flint and steel to start them smouldering
a campfire blazes
jack sleeps beside a tiny fire shivering under his new cloak
a tiny glowing light streaks out of the woods
it circles around jack
the light touches the fire and it blazes up like a bonfire waking jack
jack stares at the radiant buble hanging above him
he sees a tiny woman child with delicate dragonfly wings trapped inside
this is jack cont os whore you
luna zooms off into the treetops
jack grabs a flaming brand and jumps to his feet
jack cont whos there
watching him through the drifting smoke in gump an elf no more than the waist high
slightly built he is near naked in spite of the cold
his face is that of a child yet his eyes shine with a wisdom centuries old
gump smiling mysteriously here you be a forest child and not know the gump
jack gump is it
gump aye jack
honeythorn gump at your service
the air is filled with frenzied clicks and snaps stones tapping sticks rubbing logs being thumped etc
numbers of green glowing eyes stare at jack out of the shadows
jack frightened how dyou know my name
gump how does a migrating swallow know the way south in winter
or a spawning salmon find the tiny freshet of his birth from the black cold depths of the mysterious sea
i know everything jack
why has this happened
why is it winter now
gump id be a powerful wizard indeed could i answer
shrewdly suppose you tell me jack
jack in uncomfortable
how can i do that
gump you know these woods as well as any elf
did you not see something odd today
any strange spirits
did nothing untoward happen
i took lili to see the unicorns
gump furious you did what
numbers of elves and faeries appear out of the dark woods
they come in all sizes from sprites no larger than squirrels to plump hobmen as big as small children
brown tom is a plump tipsy leprechaun draped with pots and pans like a tinker screwball a tiny pixie wearing an ill fitting cap and garments tassle with flowers
faeries whispering in chorus what
codfish and cockles
poo poo pudding
doo doo dumplings
shit willy whatnot
the whipering stops
all eyes are on jack
he writhes with guilt under thier scrunity
jack deepling ashamed oh god she touched him
a groan rises from the crowd of faeries
they are outraged
gump is the maddest of all
his face darkens
his eyes glow
he trembles with banshee fury
gump touched it
a mortal laid hands on a unicorn
brown tom bad
jack we meant no wrong
gump screaming what was it you did mean jack
gump cold and hard nothing he calls it
jack i wanted to share something special with her
i have something now to share with you
a lively reel to warm your bones
gump magically pulls a violen out of thin air
jack im in no mood for dancing
gump screaming with wrath squawk
no more talk
do you think you can upset the order of the universe and not pay the price
brown tom produces ancient bag pipes screwball a tambourine
the other wee folk tune up an incredible variety of oddly shaped instryemnts seashell trumpets acorn cellos gossets serpentines blossom bell horns bone flutes all manner of drums and rattles
a wild and haunting overture begins
the rhythm is complusive
jack cannot control his body
his feet move against his will
jack frantic no
i want no part of your nonsense
gump leers demonically
gump time to dance jack
playing his fiddle gump is possessed demonic
screwball beats on a log with a pair of shin bones
the faerie orchestra breaks into an other world melody
jack leaps and jumps like a zombie
brown tom chanting round and round and round and round before youre lost you must be found the tempo increases
the musicians leap and cavort
jack twists and capers dancing against his will
screwball chanting in and out and up and down behind each smile there lurks a frown
gump leaps wildly fiddling like a demon
jack is a prisoner of the frenzied music
brown tom chanting spin and spin and spin and spin to learn to lose you first must win
gumps hops into the fire dancing and playing as sparks leap about him
the music grows wilder
jack will never survive
screwball chanting twist and reel and toe and heel the end to pain is to learn to feel
jacks face is a mask of agony
with supreme effort he hurls himself onto the ground his body jerking spasmodically to the music
jack screaming enough
the faerie orchestra falters their tempo broken
gump angry is the music not to your liking
jack gasping i
take my life if you must
what i did is unforgiveable
boldly but i did it for love
and id do it again
i love lili with all my heart and would sooner die than break a promise
gump stares at jack
a tender expression softens his flinty eyes
love you say
love is another story
jack i meant no disrespect
gump answer me this riddle and all is forgiven
jack and if i cannot
gump why jack
then tis your death song ill be playing
jack ask away and pray god my answer pleases you
gump what is a bell that does not ring yet its knell makes the angels sing
gump laughs knowing jack cant solve his riddle
jack frowns in concentration then grins as the memory of lilis song rushes back
jack the flower
to hear then ringing means your life is at an end
gump hurls his violin to the ground and stomps on it
codfish and cockles
gammon and trotters
screwball and brown tom run for cover as gump explodes in an insane fury
he throws himself to the ground kicking and screaming
gump cont rabbot noodles
schweinhundt saukraut mit schlagober
piddle puddles und ka ka crumpets
piss pots and thunder mugs
demkopf doo doo brains riddle widdler
abruptly gump stands and dusts himself off as if nothing had happened
he smiles at jack and holds out his tiny hand
gump cont you bested me jack
jack modestly a riddle with an answer is like an empty cup when youre thirsty for wine
gump well spoke
and if its wine you want its wine we shall have
gump claps his hands and four tiny glasses magically appear floating in the air before them
another clap and brown toms hat pops off his head revealing a wine bottle balanced underneath
gump cont a small measure of entertainment at best
gumps snaps his fingers and the wine bottle floats off brown toms head pausing to in mid air to fill each bobbing glass
gump cont elderberry wine
no finer drink under heaven
each one takes a glass
gump raises his in a toast
gump cont heres to jack
dancing fool and faerie friend
they all clink glasses
jack regards his with suspicion
jack im honoured gump
but no more tricks
gump to the others here be precious summertime frozen into a winter memory and the blamed fool wont drink faerie wine for fear of enchantment
they all drink jack with some relunctance
the faeries enjoy the wine
jack gags as if hes swallowed fire
jack coughing pranks
is that all youre good for
ive lost lili
use your magic to find her
set the world right
gump changing this frozen hell is beyond my modest powers
jack is there nothing you can do
gump if you want more tricks im your man
but for big questions you must go elsewhere
jack but dont you care whats happened
gump course we care
what goods the world locked in a season of death
no folks to scare on a summers night
brown tom no babies to tickle
screwball no lovers to tease
gump no more spells to cast
does that sound like an enjoyable prospect
jack we must find the answer
gump that we must
but first we better see that no harms come to the unicorns
screwball i sadly fear the worst
gumps claps his hands and everyone is magically holding luminous flower lanterns
seen from a distance the lantern lit faerie procession glows like foxfire between the massive trees
princess lili tuns swiftly between the frozen trees following the tracks of the goblins
the quilt is torn her hair dishevelled
she pauses at the top of a small steep hill
the tracks of the goblins sleigh pass below
lili jumps from the hilltop leaving the quilt floating behind like a discarded skin
it is an incrediable leap
she lands with the sureness of a wild woodland creature and runs off hair streaming behind following the trail of the sled
the faerie procession moves out of the woods onto the frozen meadow
faeries singing together what can you do when theres nothing to be done
sing a little song and have fun fun fun
the silhouette of the unicorn is glimpsed in the glow of the faerie lanterns
led by jack the faeries run towards the recumbent stallion
wisp stoops and picks up an arrow dropped by the goblins
gump this is goblins work
powerful demons are agaisnt us
jack kneels sadly beside the ice glazed unicorn
the sound of crashing hoofbeats alerts the faeries as the mare unicorn thunders out of the trees
brown tom take cover laddies
the faeries dive for protection
only jack stands his ground
the mare charges straight at jack
he is knocked to his knees as she gallops past
the unicorn wheels about
jack scrambles to his feet
she charges again skidding to a stop on the frozen grass
her alicorn is aimed straight at jacks throat
gump run jack
jack the fault was mine
i owe her my life
gump nobly spoken lad and nobility is her gift in return
the mare makes a soft noise deep in her throat
it is a cross between whale song and the cooing of doves
jack responds in kind imitating the sound exactly
screwball whats he saying
whats it mean
brown tom shrugging search me
i speak some rabbit but not a word of unicorn
the unicorn continues a sound as close to music as anything in nature
jck listens intently and answers her
gump come on jack dont keep us in the dark
jack the dark is where well stay
all warmth and light was lost when the stallion died
brown tom is there naught we can do
jack we must get the alicorn back
only then will the world return to normal
gump and how do faeries fight a demon
jack she says were to find a champion
a mortal bold of heart and pure in spirit
screwball points to the mares hoofprints in the snow
tiny wild flowers spring to life within each indentation
jack that is the warmth of her soul
not even deaths icy hand can stop it
screwball little good her soulll do us now
brown tom screwballs right
where we gonna find a champion when every mortal can swing a sword is froze stiff as an icicle
gump dont give up so quick lads
feeling jacks arm you sure youre mortal
jack indignant course i am
brown tom dubious what sort of mortal speaks unicorn
screwball why arent you frozen then
jack i dont know
i was underwater
and when i came up for air everything was covered with ice
gump youll do
we best get you some weapons
jack puzzled weapons
what are they
brown tom dubious hes no champion gump
gump well have to make him one
or kill him trying
gump leads jack and the others into the woods
the unicorn follows
faeries singing together what can you do when theres nothing to be done
sing a little song and have fun fun fun
lili creeps around the base of the tree making no sound
she moves with the grace of an animal and hides behind a gnarled root where she can watch the goblins
blix holds court surrounded by a lanterns glow
pox sits on a bit of crumbling masonary
blunder watches blix gesture with the alicorn
blix look at us
waiting around like lackies
and for what
were the ones with the power
blunder you shouldnt talk like blix
we gets in plenty big trouble
blix im not afraid
not even darkness lasts forever
blix aims the alicorn at blunder causing a burst of fire to erupt beneath the tiny helmeted goblin
blunder yelps and runs off clutching his flaming backside
blix roars with laughte
power has gone completely to his head
blix cont watch out pox
blix points the alicorn at pox
fire explodes beneath the pig faced goblin
he leaps screaming into the air
blix points the alicorn at the fire he started and it grows larger
blix cont higher
making music like the choir
blunder and pox watch blix make the fire fountain into the air
the heavens blaze
lili is dazzled
something very strange is happening within the swirling column of flame
gradually a demonic face emerges outlined in the fire we see the leering face of darkness
pox and blunder applaud blixs rebellion
pox blunder chanting higher
making music like a choir
the three unsuspecting goblins looks up and see the demonic lord of darkness flaming above them
blix tosses the alicorn into the air
blunder unwittingly catches it
blix greetings worship
pox w w welcome great lord
d d darkest of the
darkness your devotion disgusts me
you insignificant strands of toad slobber
blix and pox drop grovelling to their knees covering their heads with leaves and dirt
blunder cant control himself
he rushes forward and points the alicorn up at darkness
blunder hear me you angels of light
your reign is over
a new order begins
all the imps of hell will dance freely over this dark land
i hold the power
darkness points a burning finger at blunder
the alicorn is rippef from the goblins graps and flies up to darkness
blunder yelps in terror
something terrible happens the ground around blunder begins to soften
to his horror the little goblin sinks under as if into quicksand
it was only a joke
i didnt mean it
blunder is in up to his neck
bludner cont whatsamatter
have you no sense of humour
i hope you choke of faerie breath and flower petals
blunders hand points up from the earth
darkness zaps it turning it to another chicken claw
blunder is gone without a trace sucked under with a disgusting darknesss howls his triumph to the heavens
from her place of concealment lili overhears every word
darkness did you think this alicorn a mere plaything
with it my empire is eternal
before i ruled only the night
now my minions will frolic in darkness until the end of time
darkness aims the alicorn at the column of fire started by blix tracing an arc of flames through the night
like a mad orchestra conductot with a magic baton darkness controls the fires movements
the blaze twists and swirls across the black night blazing meteor trails bright as the aeora
blix fawning forgive this intrusion
my goblins are a free spirited lot
i like to encourage their
what do you think of this policy master
columns of flame shower around the dark lord and from within thier incendiary interiors evil wraith like spirits emerge swirling like ghosts
bright as comets numbers of etheral flaming spirits orbit their fiery master
darkness stands in total control within their mighty conflagration the alicorn his sceptre
suddenly with the pure clarity of a bell chime the presence of daylight is detected
the reflected glow of the coming dawn tinges the ground and casts it luminence over darkness and the goblins
darkness cont writhing what is this light
beams of rising sunlight advance down the tree trunks
darkness recoils wrapping his flaming cloak about him
darkness cont you killed the final unicorn
is this not true
blix and pox exchange guilty looks
blix this is true
pox undeniably t t true lord
darkness is on to them
he points with the alicorn
darkness you lie
here is dawn
almost t t true
ess s sentially true
blix that stallion is dead dead as dreams dead as legend
sunlight is half way to the ground
darkness shrinks shrivelling like a dying ember
the m m mare still lives
darkness if even one unicorn walks the earth my power is not complete
blix just a female
she has no power
the ground grows very light
darkness melts into the campfire
darkness only the power of creation
get that female
i command you
in the name of darkness
sunlight strikes the ground
darkness is gone
his arm holding the alicorn aloft the fire is the last to disappear
lili backs silently into the shadows surrrounding the great tree
lili runs straight into a driving blizzard
a distant sound alerts her and she pauses to listen
it is jack and the faeries singing
jacks voice carries above the others
jack the faeries os when times are hard and things look bad dont feel blue and dont feel sad
a look of astonished joy comes over lilis face
as the sound of singing fades she runs towards it calling eagerly
jack and the faeries troop march through the blizzard all singing merrily
jack the faeries singing if your down wearin a frown thats the time to dance like a clown
jack hears something in the distance and stops to listen
lili very faint os ja aack
jack bewildered lili
the sound of her distant call is erased by the howling storm
jack sadly decides it was a trick of the wind and hurries to catch up with the others
lili stops running
there is nothing but the wailing wind
lili softly jack
a solitary tear starts from her eyes only to freeze on her cheek like a diamond beauty spot
lili cont please god
lili drops sobbing to her knees
through her grief she sees the unicorns track in the snow each hoofprint gay with tiny blooming flowers
her courage restored lili follows this meandering trail of burgeoning life through the forest
gumps leads the way a huge boulder lodged uner the roots of a giant tree
gump proudly heres my home jack
what dyou think of that for a front door
jack thinks gump is pulling his leg
jack in jest be some job in getting it open
gump think you so
immediately two eyes blink open on the front of the boulder and he is seen to have facial features
boulder morning gump
the boulder stands on a pair of tiny legs and waddles forth from under the tree roots revealing the entrance to a cavern
he promptly trips and rolls over and over in the snows his tiny stone feet kicking wildly in the air
gump bowing after you jack
jack enters apprehensively udner the twisting roots
jack thank you
the other faeries follow leading the unicorn
an earthern antechamber under the tree high enough for jack and the unicorn
there is a small wooden door at the far end sealed with a bright brass padlock
gump brown tom
stay here with the unicorn and guard her well
brown tom like me own life
gump better than that
shes the last of her kind
gump marches to the little wooden door
he inserts a finger into the padlock twisting it like a key
instantly the pops apart
gump opens the door and enters a low tunnel beyond
tree roots twist down like dead mens fingers and clutch the ancient rune stones lodged in the earthen walls
gump and screwball walk upright in the damp tunnel but jack is forced to crawl on his hands and knees
luna flies above thier heads like a tiny neon insect
gump right this way
gump pauses by another wooden door sealed with a brass lock
he opens it instantly with his magic touch
screwball home sweet home
jack and the faeries enter a cost burrw furnished with carved wooden chairs and tables a porcelain stove and bundles of herbs hanging from the ceiling
the simple furniture is overwhlemed by vat piles of treasure gemstones pearls chests heaped with gold coins
gump fit for a kings ramsom
jack in awe as he wades through the ankle high loot
jack such riches
i feel i must be dreaming
gump if life is a dream better you dread the waking
screwball fills a golden helm with rubies and pours them out over his head
he laughs like a child in a sandpit
gump mere trinkets
lets find you something useful
lunas golden light streaks down and whirls around jacks head
he swats futilely at her
jack stop it
luna only seeks a little affection
luna hovers beside jacks cheek
jack i meant no disrespect but
make her stop will you gump
gump does your blood run so cold
youll be a corpse before your time
gump unstoppers a silver wine decanter and pours three goblets full
jack what does she want from me
gump foolish question
handing jack a goblet drink and wamr your heart
the answers at the bottom of your cup
jack sniffs his goblet suspiciously
this time he is careful not to drink when the faeries do
gump cont now then
down to business
gump pulls a bejewlled broadsword free from its scabbard
it is a remarkably beautiful weapon
jack whats this
something to cook with
gump and screwball exchange a hopeless look
gump patiently this is a weapon jack
as fine a weapon as youll ever see
jack curious so thats a weapon
whats it do
screwball world is doomed if you ask me
screwball goes back to playing with the jewels
gump pulls a silk handkerchief from his belt
gump a little demonstration
gump tosses the kerchief high in the air and it wafts slowly down
the little elf is an expert swordsman
he whirls the weapon in a gleaming blur slicing the drifting handkerchief neatly in half
gump cont with such a blade you could behead an ogre as easily as uncapping a soft boiled egg
jack thats really something
can i try
gump hands the sword to jack
gump youre the champion arent you
jack picks up half the kerchief off the jewel littered floor and tosses it into the air
as it flutters down he swings wildly with the broadsword
gump has to duck to avoid having his own head chopped off
gump cont watch out
youll get the hang of it in time
now we best see about some armour
screwball coming right up
screwball flips open the lid of a chest
folded inside is a golden chain mail coat of exquisite workmanship
gump go on
see if it fits
jack slips the coat over his head
it fits perfectly
gump nodding approval it will turn a broadhead arrow ar fifty yards
screwball he might pass for a champion in that
gump have a look at yourself jack
pointing use yonder shield for a mirror
gump exasperated the round shiny thing over there
screwball clothes never made the man
gump silences screwball with a stern look and and stalks over to a small carved desk
there is a loud musical chime
gump pulls a remarkable instrument from a pouch on his belt a wonderous crystal globe filled with whirling miniature worlds
gump studying globe hmmm
almost half way past the morning mayfly hatch
screwball sullen too cold for mayflies now
sides i aint got no timepeice
gump you first must know how to tell the time
screwball i aint got nothing
gump no more chatter
ive got work to do
gump sits at the desk setting his timepeice beside him and rummaging among his papers
jack kneels before a brightly polished shield and studies his reflection
luna round and round his head
screwball think ill brew some tea
screwball snatches variosu herbs off the ceiling
screwball cont colts foot and sassafrass
maybe a spot of spearmint
st johns wort not bad
and a little foxglove
screwball feverishly stuffs a silver teapot full of dried herbs
the unicorns flowering footprints lead lili to gumps cave
she pauses to consider the situation
snowflakes glisten in her tangled hair
she is fiercly beautiful
deciding nothing is amiss lili stalks silently inside
a small cooking fire flickers under blackened pots and an iron skillet
the mare unicorn is bedded down on a blanket of straw
brown tom lies fast asleep against her flank
the unicorn lifts her head when lili tiptoes in
brown tom is jerked awake as the mare climbs to her feet snorting with rage
brown tom what
lili im princess lili
brown tom you
youre the cause of all our sorrow
the princess drops to her knees
lili i know it was wrong
everything is my fault
please forgive me
brown tom i aint the one ye should be asking
lili i want to make it up to her
i followed the goblins
they gave the alicorn to the lord of darkness
brown tom good lass
youre a plucky little partridge at that
lili we cant stay here
its not safe
darkness sent the goblins to hunt the mare
if i found her so will they
we msut go
brown tom looks past lili to the mouth of the cave
brown tom too late
pox and blix stand in the entrance aiming their wicked barbed arrows straight at the hearts of lili and brown tom
brown tom swings an iron skillet back over his head in a warriors stance
brown tom if you impsre looking for a fight yeve come to the chap wholl oblige ye
blix pox kill
k k kill
blix and pox loose their arrows renocking the bows with incredible speed
brown tom moves like lightning using the skillet as a shirld to deflect the arrows raining about him
lili stands in front of the mare striving to protect the unicorns body with her own
brown tom lepas acrobatically about with the skillet
a fusillade of arrows clangs off its iron surface
a lucky shot peirces brown toms hat
dark red liquid streams down his face
his eyes roll up in mortal terror
brown tom dick o tuesdays duck
theyve done for me
brown tom staggers in a dramatic half circle toppling straight over backwards stiff as a board
the mare unicorn rears whinnying on her hind quarters
the goblin hunters advance
blix spreads a heavy net wide
the black shadow on the net falls across lili and the unicorn like an evil spider web
screwballs teapot steams merrily
he sits stop a jewel cask enjoying a cup
a horned viking helmet several sizes too large covers his head down to the bridge of his nose
gump works at his desk marking out distances on an ancient chart with a pair of golden dividers
dozens of parchment mps are spread in front of him
gump muttering forty leagues from the dragons track
another half span past the basilisk den
gump lifts his elbow and the curled parchment rolls together
gump cont annoyed wirrikows and dopplegangers
screwball spot of tea gump
help calm your nerves
gump not now
im busy with navigation
on the other side of the cave jack practices a variety of thrusts and passes with his sword in front of the polished shield
luna buzzes around him like a miniature meteorite
jack thats not so bad
what do you think luna
jack studies his reflection in the shield
there is a burst of light behind him
luna materialises as a child sized woman with gossamer wings
she wraps her slender arms around his neck
luna i think you look like a hero
hd you do that
jack spins around but luna is gone
only the tiny dot of light hovers in the air
jack cont puzzled magic
jack looks back at the shield and there is a full sized luna hugging his reflection
luna nobody knows nut you
its our secret
kissing his cheek promise
jack squirming dont do that
luna another kiss better promise
jack all right all right
a loud musical chieme interrupts gumps work
he looks around for his timepiece but it is nowhere in sight
screwball all innocence something i can do for you gump
gump hand it over
sheepishly screwball pulls gumps timepeice from inside his tunic and gives it back
screwball well well well
howd that get in there
must be some kinda magic
gump sneak thiefs magic
studies timepiece jack
its time we were on our way
at the sound of gumps voice luna transforms instantly back to a dot of light
jack im ready as ill ever be
jack picks up the shield and starts after gump and screwball
luna flies overhead
brown tom lies flat on his back as jack and the faeries emerge from the tunnel
gump rushes to his fallen friend lifting him in his arms
gump brown tom
you cant be dead
oh this is is terrible
brown tom opens his eyes and looks feebly about
brown tom in a daze why wisp
they kill you too
gump course they didnt
what in blazes are you talking about
brown tom rolls his eyes up at the arrow piercing his hat
brown tom goblins shot me through the brain pan
gump yanks off brown toms hat
bits of broken wine bottle tumble out
gump reagrds his friend with scorn
gump your brains are one spot an arrowd do no harm
jack wheres the unicorn
sheepishly brown tom pulls the arrow from his hat
brown tom im afeered the goblins took her
did me best to fight them off but they swarmed up by the hundreds
horrid creatures they were
the princess warned me but
jack princess lili
brown tom aye
jack overjoyed shes alive
brown tom she was living still when they killed me
gump youll earn your champions spurs this day jack
well follow their tracks in the snow
foul weathers on our side for a change
jack and the faeries march through the woods holding lanterns into the teeth of a driving blizzard
blix and pox kneel nervously before the throne of darkness
a huge fire blazes in the hearth
pox hail m most great and d d darkest of the dark
blix though we be nothing in your sight we bow before your strength and might
we hear darkness speak but see only his bat winged shadow spread like an inky cloak across the two kneeling goblins
darkness os can you fawning sycophants do more than grovel
what of the task i set you
pox d d done lord
we have the m m m m m m
darkness os where is she
blix in the dungeon like a treasure awaiting your darkest pleasure
darkness os very good
you two are not entirely devoid of talent
pox theres m m more sire
blix though unworthy of your magnificence trifles without consequence we present with all due deference
darkness os gift
what sort of gift
blix this thing you once called innocence
darkness os innocence
i must behold this wonder
darkness stares into the fire
as darkness grimps the arm of his throne his fingers start to melt dripping to the dank stone floor
darkness bleeds through the groin vault ceiling speading like a stain across the curving stones
below the unicorn is locked in a steel halter a woven steel cable binding her to an iron windlass
the princess paces the dark and dripping cell
her dress is in tatters her hair tangled
there is something wild and free about her now and yet she has never appeared more alluring
the melting shadow of darkness drips from the ceiling forming a small demonic shape as it falls
we hear the beating of darkness heart in time with each evil drip
the sound grows louder and louder until the echo reverberates within the vaulted chamber
lili is terrified
she looks frantically around as the pulsing rhytm continues
the princess sees nothing and hugs the unicorns neck for comfort
darkness contemplates the raging flames his heartbeat thundering
jack and the faeries stare out at the tree crowned ruin and surrounding bog
jack and the faeries wade forward through the drifting curtains of mist
jack legend says the dark castle stood in olden days when evil anarchy ruled the land
the wicked still come here to sacrafice
gump they worship the demon
screwball its ugly
i hate it
you shall go first
close on darkness
for the briefest instant we see the smouldering eyes of the demon glowing in anitcipation out of the shadows
although jack is in no trouble the water is rapidly growing too deep for the faeries
gump urges screwball forward gump go on
screwball all the time me
same old story
screwball clibs up onto a floating lily pad
an undulating v shaped wake moves through the water alongside as they step from lily pad to lily padf and clamber onto a long twisting root
without warning an emaciated green arm shoors out of the water and grabs screwball
he is gone under the surface with a scream
brown tom screwball
jack what was that
gump big trouble
jack grips the hilt of his sword and rushes to the spot where screwball disappeared
jack weve got to do something
before jack can finish meg mucklebones rises out of the bog behind him
she tosses screwball aside and hauls jack into her cadaverous embrace
meg foul tasting faerie
come to me juicy boy
jack yelps in horror
meg cont who be this tender morsel disturbing meg mucklebones rest
jack terrified they call me green jack maam
the faeries watch in dismay
brown tom our champions a goner he is
the fearsome hag pinches jack with her wicked talons
meg what a fine fat boy you are
jack you dont mean to eat me do you maam
meg oh indeed i do
jack that would be a shame miss meg
youre so lovely
you deserve far better than scrawny little me
the flattery gives hairy meg a pause she simply cant resist it
think me fair do you jack
jack all the heavenly angels must envy your beauty
what a find meal youll make be the rest of you as sweet as your tongue
jack let me go and ill sing songs of praise to you
meg let you go
dont be daft
ive had naught but muskrat and snakes all this month
bit of rancid goblin too
dont you like my words
meg words are little help in filling an empty stomach
jack then fill your soul with loveliness
look into your glass and feast on beauty
meg theres no looking glass here
sometimes when the moon is full ill chance to see my reflection in the bog
jack glances at the shield hanging over his shoulder
jack my shield would serve you well
meg mucklebones takes jacks shield partially releasing him from her clammy clutches
meg what a splendid idea
you be so clever jack
hanging onto jack with one hand hairy meg bends over the shield
jack your radiance is the alchemy that makes rusted steel shine like silver
meg primps and preens an obscene parody of a pretty maiden at her vanity table
i be the envy of any princess in the land
while meg is pre occupied with her grotesque reflection gump catches the jacks eyes
the cunning elf silently mouths the word sword pointing to his waist at the same time
jack better you are a queen without a peer
a reigning angel
jack nods to gump and silently draws his sword
meg doesnt notice thing
meg you have such discerning taste for so young a boy
meg turns to face him with a fearful pucker of her tattered lips
meg cont come jack
give us a kiss before dining
jack petrified with fear
gump shouting give her the kiss of cold steel jack
jack swings blindly with his eyes closed
it is a lucky stroke meg mucklebones head flies from her shoulders
jack astonished i did it
the decapitated hag sinks back beneath the scummy surface
gump like a chmapion jack
brown tom bravo
jack hows screwball
screwball chewed but not disgested
jack points his sword at the hollow tree
jack then on to victory
faeries all together on to victory
a huge fire blazes in the gaping hearth
darkness stands before it almost a shadow in his midnight cloak
darkness ive been an exile for too long
banished by the sun
forced to hide in the bowels of the earth
on the eve of my greatest victory this
child of nature appears
it has been an eternity since i felt such desire
i could know her in an instant
she is helpless
anguished what is wrong with me father
a voice in the fire answers darkness majestic and sepulrchral the flames billow out as it speaks voice you hold the world in your grasp
supreme power belongs to you
yet your triumph is meaningless
voice what do you gain from it
what pleasure comes from ruling a pack of imps and goblins
souls already black
this innocent creature fascinates you because only she can appreciate the enormity of your achievement
darkness ill take her then
voice a hollow victory
she remembers the world as it was when she loves your new order you will triumph
break her spirit
darkness thank you father
your wisdom is ever my guide
she must desire you
nothing else matters
jack and the faeries step ashore on the island
gump makes a mystical sign with his hands
jack whats that
gump for our protection jack
you must be ready
remember darkness is a liar
a treacherous fiend
dont listen to him
never believe what you see
jack he wont fool me
gump dont be so sure
no human has ever set foot in this place before
jack and the faeries stare up at the massive horn embedded in the inner tree
screwball starts to climb towards it
screwball what a nice big trumpet
bet it sounds louder than anything
gump hauls him back down by the seat of his pants
gump dont touch it
our lives are lost if it blows
jack finds an opening hidden between the roots of the inner tree
jack in here
ive found a passage
jack drops inside
the moment jack enters the inner tree a deep tremor reverberates through the subterranean castle of darkness
draped in shadows before the fire the dark lord looks up at this disturbance
darkness to the fire i feel a presence
some power invades my sanctity
voice from the flames every wolf suffers fleas
tis easy enough to scratch
the flames surge out towards darkness embracing him
like the catacombs of paris the walls are decorated with bones and human skulls
at each corner of the open ceiling is a carved demonic head
jack and the faeries stand looking up
gump gloomily the decor of death
brown tom tells you somthing bout him what lives here
screwball its a dead end
jack searches along the ossuary walls
jack doesnt make sense
check the walls
there must be some sort of secret key
screwball doesnt join the other faeries in the search
he is attracted by several round stone balls lying in the rubble
picking up three with a happy grin he begins to juggle
screwball one two three
fidde dee dee
gump sees what screwball is doing and flies into a rage
drop those this minute
screwball tosses the balls carelessly over his shoulder
one lands in the stone cornice near the ceiling and rolls along gathering momentum as it passes through the open mouths of each gargoyle
the balls disappears into the mouth of the final gargoyle
it is swallowed with an emphatic gulp
all at once the roof slides shut above
brown tom alarmed newt finger marmalade
the floor pulls suddenly open and they all plummet screaming into empty space
luna circles a dot of light above tthe bottomless pit
luna wee voice oh dear
the tiny faerie whirls in a blur of indecision before streaking down into the dark opening after her falling friends
like prisoners on a fairground helter skelter jack and the faeries spin down a seemingly endless curvinbg chute
gump singing when timesre hard and thing look bad dont feel blue and dont feel sad
jack how can you sing at a time like this
gump can you think of anything better to do
they hurtle through festooned cobwebs stirring up smokey clouds of ancient dust
the end of the chute opens into an iron cage
jack and the faeries tumble through onto a pile of straw
luna is right behind bright as a firefly
brown tom ouch
screwball where are we
gump stares woefully at the iron bars
gump some place we dont want to be
a scuffling noise in the far side of the cage attracts their attention
blunder pops up from a pile of straw still wearing his helmet
what is this
a chatterbox convention
screwball who be you bucket head
gump stay clear of that imp
hes a hell hound goblin
blunder what i am wont help me none nor you neither
blunder pulls off his helmet
he is screwballs indenical twin
even if you is my brother
screwball cant believe his eyes
screwball astonished blunder
they rush into each others arms
gump to jack a buttercup family reunion
i cant believe it
last i remember he sold screwball a jug of dragons tears that turned out to be cow piss
screwball what happened to you
blunder flexing his bird claw its a long story
lets just say i went look for adventure and found moren i could handle
doesnt matter now anyway
were all of us in the same fix
jack just what sort of fix is that
blunder the kitchen of the lord of darkness
all of us be on his menu
screwball i knew it
i knew it
should of stayed at home
blunder thats right brother men you is barbeque
brown tom wish i had a drink
jack only dead meat waits for the stewpot
spring the lock gump
gump examines the huge padlock with a frown
gump wearily iron is sore trouble for elves
screwball magics no good against it
jack slumps down in the corner to think things over
the faeries mill about by the opposite wall
jack stares at the bars
luna orbits his head
jack i know i promised
but its the only way
luna buzzes him furiously
jack cont sure its a secret
itll keep forever when were all dead
jack glances guiltily at the whirling dot of light
jack cont to gump why not have luna fly out between the bars and find a key
gump shaking his head shes much too small
could never lift it
jack blurting it out not if she changes sizes like she can
there is a bright flash of faerie light and luna stands full sized before them her gossamer wings a tremble
gump cont outraged you wilful sprite
how dare you keep such secrets
luna theyre mine to keep
but ill do what you ask
if you kiss me jack
jack thats easy enough
jack kisses her chastely on the cheek
luna call that a kiss
am i not sweet
jack eager to please sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind
luna moves in close to jack
luna sweet is the wind thats blows me to you
jack gently pushes her away
jack its not possible
im in love
luna a faeries love makes anything possible
a soft cocoom of faerie light engulfs luna
she metamorphoses within it emerging as princess lili
even you hearts desire
luna lili embraces jack
it is sweet and tempting
jack resisting no
this isnt real
screwball and blunder giggle and snigger
luna lili oh but it is
im warm and alive and happy to be in your arms
jack is nearly enchanted but after a delicious moment he pushes away
jack i cant do it
this is faerie glamour
a brilliant aura of faerie light envelops luna lili and she transforms into her true winged form luna bitterly you
i could vex you
dance you life away
jack threats cant make you love you
human hearts dont work that way
luna what care i for human heart
soft and spiritless as porridge
a faeries heart beats fierce and free
there is a furious pytotechnic whirlwind and in an instant luna returns to a tiny dot of light
without an answer luna flies out between the iron bars
jack cont to the faeries i
didnt mean to hurt her
gump scornful your fine senseibilities have left us here to rot
the sound of heavy footsteps approaches accompanied by rough tuneless singing
this lil piggie went to market
anudder lil pigge got eat
pig meat pie ll piggie die
blunder oh no
blunder conceals himself under a pile of straw
a deformed shadow is cast across the cage
screwball blunders got the right idea
screwball hides in the straw
jack and the other immediately do the same
a fiendish demon cook opens the cage door
he is ten feet tall and unspeakably ugly
he peers blindly inside sniffing the air with his hideous nose
pig pig pig
the cook gropes inside the cage
the cook reaches deep into the straw pile in teh corner and grabs blunder
turn me loose you tub o guts
the cook hauls blunder out kicking and screaming
he locks the cage abd stumps away
blunder cont i hope i give you heart burn
after a bit the faeries and jack peer up out of the straw
screwball woefully fricasseed faeries the lot of us
brown ton lambs to the slaughter
jack draws his sword
jack not without a fight
transformed back to full size luna tip toes into the alcove outside the cage her hands coyly behind her
luna maliciously you look like mourners at your own funeral
gump angry come back to dance on our graves
luna id gladly frolic on jacks
she laughs and holds up a large iron key
but this cage shant be your tomb
luna tosses the key in to gump
instantly she reduces to a tiny dot of light and flies out of the alcove
gump well done
gump unlocks the barred door and they all clamber out
screwball steps on brown toms head in his eagerness
screwball lemme outta this stink hole
brown tom mind you bleeding foot
jack is the last of all
jack keep behind me in case theres trouble
sword in hand jack eads the faeries out of the alcove into the kitchen
huge ovens belch fire and smoke
the vast hearth blazes
like the lower reaches of hell the dark lords kitchen is a place where all hope is abandoned
jack and the faeries creep through the brimstone haze
brown tom terrible sight for a sober man to see
the demon cooks blocks the way chopping meat with a montrous cleaver a second cook every bit as terrifying snores by the hearth
trussed to a spit blunder hangs upside down nearby
jack motions the faeries on
the blind cook turns them sniffing the air
cook whut be there
jack and the faeries duck behind a huge bellows
back in the frying pan
gump clamps his hand over screwballs mouth
grasping his cleaver the cook advances towards them
cook sniffing be it live victuals
from where he hangs blunder sees the faeries plight
blunder calling out hey
the cook turns angered by this insult
cook whut say pip squeak
blunder two things down here look just alike
blunder your face and my ass
the cook growls with fury
cook bash in you face
den it no be so pretty
the cook backhands poor blunder smacking him about like a punching bag
jack and the faeries make a break for the exit
blunder manages to work one arm free from his bonds
cook cont whut you got to say now pork pie
blunder rears back and punches the cook in the jaw
stunned he topples over over backwards a great crash
the reverberations tremble through the immense underground castle
darkness listens by the fire
darkness do you feel it father
loose in my domain
voice out of fire guard well what is yours
darkness roaring bring innocence to me
the faerie band gathers in the foul dripping corridor
irregular torchlight casts a lurid glow across the broken stones
brown tom gasping for breath saved
by a goblin
jack wish we could repay the favour
screwball my brother can take of himself
gump screwballs right
its more important we find the unicorn
jack and lili
brown tom where do we start
gump we must find the dungeons
legend has is they house such sirriw that death is a gift
albeit one rarely granted
screwball sits down defiantly
screwball think ill stay right here thank you very much
gump grabs hold of screwballs ear and hauls him back up
gump not so fast
you search with the rest of us
screwball hugs jacks leg
screwball all right
im going with jack
gump no you wont
be faster if we split up
screwball looks both ways deciding which seems safest
im going this way
brown tom im going that way
they both turn and collide falling flat on their rumps
better to search in teams gump and me together
brown tom you and screwball look in the other direction
gump hauls out his ornate timepeice
we meet back here in twice five hundred beats of a bluebirds heart
brown tom takes a similar timepeice from under his tunic and studies its intricate interior
brown tom best to allow another couple dozen butterfly breaths in case we get thirs
er get lost
gump no grog shops down here brown tom
jack lets hurry
jack and gump run off along the corridor followed by lunas glowing light
screwball watches without moving
screwball know what i want to know
brown tom what
screwball why me
brown tom gives screwball a swift kick in his rear
brown tom why not
the two little elves scamaper off together
screwball i hate it
i hate it
i hate it
the iron studded dungeon days swing magically open as lili watches her eyes aglow with animal fire
she crouches beside the unicorn resting on her haunches in an easy feline fashion
lili rises like a sleepwalker unable to resist the compulsion luring her toward the open doorway
the chained unicorn whinnies pitifully
princess lili looks back without expression as she leaves
lunas bobbing light leads the way as jack and gump hurry along the rubble choked corridor
alerted by the sound of something they dart into the shadows
gump quick jack
jack and gump watch in horror as a cracked egg the size of a watermelon runs down the corridor on armor scaled chicken legs led on either side by a
demon holding a chain leash
jack draws his sword
the demons stop and the egg begins to crack
jack ill scramble that one
gump restrains him
the egg cracks apart
gump dont trust your eyes
all is enchanted here
the egg breaks into pieces and a dripping winged monster emerges a diabolic cross between a bat and a pterodactyl
it emits a fearsome shriek and flies off down the corridor followed by the twin attendant demons
jack and gump hurry on in the opposite direction
screwball and brown tom creep timorously forward
they are alerted by the sounds of something approaching
a hideously deformed shadow fall across the opposite wall
the two faeries clutch each other in terror and duck into the shadows
it is princess lili
she passes the evles hiding place as if in a trance
jack and gump emerge on a narrow span arching across the vast central of the undreground castle
similiar viaducts above and below bridge the awesome chasm
the green man and the faerie gawk at the sheer magnitude of it all
jack not even kings live like this
on a high span above jack sees princess lili drifting by like a somnabulist
jack cont my god
gump dont believe it jack
jack yelling lili
the sound echoes through the vast space
the princess pauses
a section of parapet has broken off and she wanders to the edge staring down into the void
for a precarious moment she teeters on the brink seemingly about to fall
jack os calling li li
the princess does not respond wobbling like a dreamer on the narrow edge of disaster
she leans against the ruined parapet and a bug chunk of masonry breaks away tumbling and bouncing into the abyss
jack cont os calling its ja ack
lilis face is blank
she turns and continues blindly on her way
jack stares up at lilis retreating form
jack its her
i know it
gump dont be so hasty
remember who were dealing with
jack ive got to reach her
jack races off
gump runs along behind
the shadowy figure of darkness looms over a band of deformed pygmies with needle sharp teeth and wickedly curved talons long as pitchfork tines
darkness my enemies approach
darkness points an evil finger and the pygmies scurry cackling off
jack and gump hurry out onto the arching span
the princess is nowhere in sight
gump running after slow down
use some caution
jack this way
jack runs on into the corridor in the direction taken by lili
gump follows after
lili wanders down a long colonnade with dangling vine like roots
a glistening magic rain falls from the granite ceiling
her blank eyes stare straight ahead
jack and gump appear at the opposite end of the passage in time to see the princess drift out of sight
jack there she is
jack and gump run to catch up pushing through root tendrils agleam with rain
suddenly they are attacked by screaming pygmies
jack drawing his sword demons
the nimble pygmies leap about them lethal talons slashing through the drizzle
jack and gump retreat backing between clingling rootlets
gump yanks open a heavy oaken door in the side wall and they duck inside slamming it shut in the teeth of the attacking pygmies
jack strains against the door handle struggling to keep the portal shut tight
there is less space than in a closet
the corridor behind them is completely bricked over
close on door with great force the pygmies claws stab through the thick wood like stiletties
their needle tips are mere inches from jack and gump
the doors inner surface is studded with talons
jack suddenly slams the door open with such force it swings into the side wall with a loud crash
the pygmies frenzied screaming ends in abrupt silence
jack and gump peer cautiously out
the pymies hang unconscious on the other side of the door dangling from their imbedded talons
jack come on
jack and gump run into the rain
jack and gump hurry around the corner just as lili heads towards a pair of massive doors swinging slowly open at her approach
jack calling lili
gump grabs jacks arm and yanks him to a stop
gump dont be daft
shes under a spell
lili enters and the doors swing closed behind her
an enormous chamber draped with black cloth surrounded by tall baroque columns
winged demons writhe in the shadows above
a long black table reaches down the centre of the room
all is lit by firelight
the gaping hearth with its entablature of monumental sculpture is flanked by a pair of massive ebony thrones carved in a hideous twisting mass of tendons sinews and museles
when the imposing doors swing closed lilis spell is broken
she stares in terror at her news surroundings
something weird and mysterious approaches from out of the draped shadows
it is a magnificent high collared black gown waltzing like a ghost across the black marble floor
there is no one wearing the garment
fascinated lili watches the dress circle towards her
she finds it irresistable
taking hold of the gowns empty sleeves she begins to dance spinning round and round to the impulsive music
jack paces back and forth in front of the sealed doors
jack why did you stop me
gump we best reconnoitre
what if its a trap
gump and jack strain to see through the crack between the doors
lili dances by herself turning slow dreamy circles before the blazing fire
she is now wearing the splendid black gown
reflected firelight glitters in the shadows
an open jewel box spills its sparkling treasure onto an ornate table
lili is lure like a moth to the flame
she steps up onto an oversized footstool by the table
the ebony casket brims with gemstones
lilis eyes dazzle
a carved ebony figure of a skeleton turns slowly out of the centre holding in its up lifted arms the most exquisite black diamond necklace the mind can imagine
the princess sucks in her breath
the temptation is too great
she impulsively takes the necklace and hops down from the stool
the high collar of her gown makes fastening the clasp difficult and without thinking she backs towards the wall fumbling behind her neck
she leans against a sculpted marble frieze of souls in torment concentrating on the tricky clasp
all at once a piece of sculpture becomes animate
powerful arms reach out to fasten the necklace
for a moment lili doesnt notice grateful for the help
then she realises what is happening and screams
the musular black arms reach for her as she pulls away in terror
lili turns to run but is stopped short by her reflection in a tall cheval glass mirror
she looks furtively about making certain she is unobserved
alone she admires her perfect image
close on mirror beneath lilis pleased expression we see the evil face of darkness appear like a man emerging from under water
darkness penetrates the surface of the mirror
lili backs away gasping soundlessly with terror
darkness steps forth through the glass into the room clad in black finery
darkness reaches to embrace her and the princess shrieks at the top of her lungs
the moment he touches her shoulder she slumps tothe floor unconscious
darkness stands over the fallen girl his heartbeat pulsing like muffled thunder
something almost like a smile creases his hideous features as he rolls a lock of lilis hair between his clawed fingers
the princess blinks and opens her eyes
she is horrified to find darkness kneeling over her and frantically tries to get away
darkness do not be afraid lady
lili gasps like a stranded fish
she is catatonic with fear
darkness cont i mean you no harm
darkness offers the princess his hand
darkness cont how like you my gifts
does the gown not please you
lilis terror renders her speechless
darkness cont the colour is most suitable
we sanctify the death of the old world and the birth of a new order
you are the guest of honour
lili weeps and tugs at the black dress
take this away
i beg you
darkness advances on lili
the slow kettldrum throb of his heart underscores his words
darkness your soul in like some dark nectar
i cannot rest unril i taste its sweetness
lili frantic never
i hate you
i hate this dress
darkness can you speak so of your bridal gown
lili screaming nooooooooo
jack and gump listen by the closed doors to lilis peircing scream os
jack is desparate and half draws his sword from the scabbard
jack what has he done to her
gump restrains the boy
gump you have no power to stop it
be thankful she lives
jack shoves his sword back in disgust
jack bitterly some champion
what good is this fancy sword
gump its not the sword that counts but the man who swings it
lili slumps to the cold stone floor weeping
darkness bends solicitously over her
darkness why the tears
everything is lost
darkness why weep for him
he left you alone to die
hed never do that
he was killed
like everything else
darkness glancing over his shoulder yes
but why mourn
you have a new and grander destiny
lili consort of some cowardly vile toad who slinks through the night
darkness not so
i requite to shadows solace and dark of the night
sunshine is my destroyer
lili scornful you think youre so powerful
and hide in the ground like a mole
darkness smiling this too will change
the last unicorn dies tonight
as her blood ebbs the sun sets forever
there shall never be another dawn
lili horrified no
darkness throws back his evil head and laughs
the demonic laughter of darkness carries through the massive doors
jack he means to kill the mare gump
gump dont mourn the corpse til the coffins in the ground
darkness os my dominion shall encompass the enternal night
gump as long as the sun still shines so does hope
jack bitterly sun doesnt shine down here
jack fingers lilis silver medallion hanging around his neck and from out of the blue inspiration strikes
jack cont grinning wait a minute
i think i know a way
lili stares at darkness with terror and loathing
darkness the world shall be at last as nature intended
a place of chaos and anarchy
lili youre mad
darkness aye lady and proud to be so
for in madness lies the soul of all thats noble
can you fathom the loneliness of untold eons lived in darkness
my spirit was forged in that black fire
lili you live alone because you are loathsome
the contagion of your wicked heart demands isolation
darkness nay mistress
ive found my mate and you know it
were just alike you and i
beneath the skin we are already one
darkness twas your sin trapped the unicorn
even now the evil seed of what youve done blooms within you
lili shrieking you lie
darkness stung by her words no more so than you
cant you sense it
that is why i desire you
i need someone to share the dark secrets of my soul
you disgust me
youre nothing but a beast
darkness everyone is a beast
only most are afraid to see it
darkness compels lili over to the mirror with the force of his will
lili sees her reflection in the glass
the lovely feminine features alter into those of a cat like beast
darkness os this mirror shows how we really are
behold your true reflection
lili pulls free from his graps and turns from the glass
her face remains lovely and unchanged
lili frantic no
youre working magic on me
i wont believe it
darkness my lady misjudges me
i am no common trickster
look at you hands
lilis fingers transform before her eyes hooked claws spring from their tips coarse black hair pushes the skin
darkness cont laughing my mirror never lies
lilis lovely face undergoes the same tranmutation she witnessed in the mirror
she feels fur covered sheeks and pointed ears
this time her scream is hysterical
darkness places a protective arm around lili
darkness cont glory in your animal nature
it is your triumph
lili im hideous
the puling pallid creature you were was truly something disgusting
now you are magificent
a fierce goddess
lili jerks away hissing and showing her claws
lili damn you
darkness we are both of us damned my queen
darkness bows with mock formality altering into his own shadows which slides through a crack in the paving stones
lili cannot resist her reflection
she falls to the floor weeping
round and red the great disc of the setting sun slides towards the distant horizon
crazed by anxiety jack finds the keyhole and cups his hands around it
jack calling out lili
can you hear me
lili huddles weeping on the cold stones
at the sound of jacks voice the princess looks up with a start
jack os over here
by the door
lili turns eagerly turns to the door
lili oh jack
can it really be you
i was afraid you were dead
jack thank god youre all right
i didnt know what to do
i never want to lose you again
lili pauses before the keyhole out of jacks line of sight
lili jack my love
my precious love
i pray its you and not more wicked magic
jack its me you can be sure of that
and theres magic on our side too
lili its all my fault
jack os my fault as much as yours
were here to save you
lili sadly im far past saving sweet jack
a huge tears wells in lilis eye and flies out toward the keyhole defying gravity
lilis tear flies through the keyhole and strikes jacks face like a horizontal raindrop
he touches the spot curiously
gump amazed how did you do that
jack to gump i didnt do anything
into keyhole let me see your face
it will give me hope
jack strains to see through the keyhole
lili stares at the keyhole in horror
just to glimpse your smile
lili grief stricken no
forget me jack
the princess reaches out her animals paw and covers the keyhole
as the light in the opening grows dark jack tenderly places his hand next to lilis
i love you
gump pulls frantically on jacks arm
gump come jack
weve no time to spare
remember your plan
sadly jack takes his hand from the keyhole and follows gump back along the corridor
princess lili lies sobbing
high above the winged figures watch her
the music throbs underscoring a low rhythmic chanting
like some ghastly chorus fro hell the living statuary sings in unison to lili statuary singing bride of night
bride of night
darkness is your hearts delight
hail to darkness
hail the night
his the power and the might
master of chaos lord of doom sing his praises from the tomb
lili lifts her head listening to the sepulchral singing
her eyes burn like a tigers
she bares her fangs and from her throat issues a bone chilling howl
screwball and brown tom stop short in their tracks when they hear the sound of a distant howl echoes in the shadows
screwball trembling i vote we run like hell
the two faeries scamper off into darkness
gump jack and a woman sized luna wait outside the kitchen door as brown tom and screwball come running up
gump studies his ornate timepiece
gump where were you
in another three flicks of a badgers tail itll be half past
time slips away when youre having so much fun
brown tom out of breath we
found the mare chained
in the dungeon below
gump shoves his timepiece back in his belt
who has a bit of parchment
the two faeries search in their clothing
screwball produces a plethora of trash marbles string old dolls eyes coloured birds eggs ancient coins etc
at last he finds a crumbled peice of sheepskin
i was saving it to write me will on
brown tom where theres a will theres a
gump shush both of you
jack has a plan
a good one
gump squats on the floor and using a triangle and some charcoal divides the parchment into mysterious lines and angles
angle of refraction equals
angle of incidence
multiplied by a factor of fourty
divided by the square root of a google plex
gump snaps his fingers triumphantly
gump cont perfect
it will work like a charm jack
jack lets get started
what we need to do is sneak back into the kitchen and gather all the plates and platters
screwball oh no
seen enough of that kitchen i have
brown tom dont be so pig headed
you can trust gump
screwball id sooner trust a rat in the ghetto
brown tom well
trust jack then
jack eases open the kitchen door
just the shiny ones
jack leads the way back into the kitcheb
gump urges the other two to follow
and be quiet
soft as thistledown thats the faerie way
jack and the faeries tiptoe cautiosuly into the kitchen
both demon cooks are asleep the encountered first is stretched out across his chopping block snoring like a dragon with indisgestion
the unfortunate blunder turns slowly over the coals hog tied to a spit
a bright red apple is stuffed in his mouth
jack and gump rush to his side
gump pulls the apple from blunders mouth
blunder frantic get me outta here
while im still medium rare
youre a free imp on one condition
blunder very loud condition
loose me or ill make such
gump shoves the apple back into blunders mouth stoppering his loud complaint
gump any more noise and youre shish ka bob
blunder nods eagerly
gump cont you do what we tell you
more eager nodding from blunder
gump cont swear it
gump pulls the apple out of blunders mouth
blunder i swear
on the festering forelock of nicodemus
jack cuts blunders bonds and the little imp hops nibmly out of the fireplace
blunder a thousand thanks
jack boosts gump and screwball up onto the mantle where the polished plates are stacked
jack up we go
luna transforms into a dot of light and flies up to the cimnet pieces rematerialising there in her full size
jack cont your turn blunder
jack lifts blunder onto his shoulds so he can climb to the first level of the three tiered mantle
blunder joins screwball gump and luna as they rush about the mantlepiece frantically gathering shield sized plates
one by one the faeries toss the plates down to jack who stacks them in brown toms arms
brown tom staggers through the kitchen carrying a teetering tower of plates
he cant see where he is going and trips over the nozzle of the giant bellows
the plates fall with a deafening crash
both ferocious blind cooks are awakened by the noise
second cook huh
jack and the faeries freeze in place as the cook rises and pulls his huge cleaver from the chopping block
cook sniffing the air meat
me smells fresh meat
jack draws his sword and steps between the awesome cook and brown tom sprawled helplessly on the floor
second cook find meat
jack over here
the blind cook lunges for jack
he wields his deadly cleaver with amazing accuracy for one without sight
cook chop it up
jack ducks past the cook smacking him on the leg with the flat of his blade
the huge demon yelps in pain
the second cook picks up a skillet wielding it like a club
second cook smash
jack is caught between the two demon cooks
he cannot face one without turning his back on the other
gump sees jacks predicament and leaps from the mantle onto the second cooks head with a wild cry gump schweinhundt
gump clings to the second cook like a terrier confusing him and giving jack time to dart acrobatically out of the way
jack jabbing the cook gotcha
cook cut you in half
a mighty swing from the cook misses jack who executes a nimble back flip
the cook cleaves through a hanging side of meat by mistake
the second cook grabs hold of gump and shakes him
second cook sweet sweet blood
up on the mantle screwball and blunder exchange a helpless look
gump is a goner unless they do something
they a simultaneous unspoken conclusion and leap onto the second cooks back
screwball calling out rooster toes
blunder calling out
faced with this new twin threat the second cook drops gump who immediately bities him on the leg
second cook whut
jack fights a rearguard action stabbing at the savage cook as he retreats
jack best you can do
cook you gonna be mince meat
jack back onto a steep stone ramp against the far wall
jack got to catch me first
the cooks cleaver clangs against the ramp missing jack by inches
the second cook has his hands full
brown tom has joined the fray and clings to his other leg while blunder and screwball claw and punch at his head
screwball blunder hit him
staggering under the full weight of the faerie onslaught the second cook lurches in circles
second cook kill
furious the second cook swings his heavy skillet at screwball and blunder
he misses them completely hitting himself square on the head and knocking himself out
the faeries leap off as the demon toppes backwards into the fireplace
gump we must help jack
the faeries race to the foot of the ramp
jack parries the cooks fearsome swing
the cook presses him relentlessly
the clash of steel rings through the cavernous kitchen
the faeries start up the ramp like a tiny cheering section
blunder stick him a good one
screwball cut him down to size jack
giant wine barrels are stacked at tge top of the ramp
the cook back jack against them
there is no further room for retreat
cook gonna spill your guts boy
the cook swings his cleaver from the hip
jack nimbly springs out of harms way
the cleaver drives full force into one of the chocks supporting the pyramid of wine barrels
grumbling the cook yanks his cleaver free
this pulls the chock loose from under the bottom barrel
cook cont listening wuzzat
the entire stack of barrels shifts rolling towards the cook
cook cont bad news
the cook runs for his life
the huge hogshead rumble forward in a wooden avalanche
jack crouches at the top of the ramp
as the cook runs past he sticks the sword blade between his legs and trips him up
the cook tumbles head over heels down the ramp
half way up the faerie band sees the giant barrels rolling towards them
screwball horrified sodom and glockamora
the faeries turn and run
the barrels crash on top of the fallen cook knocking him senseless as they continue rolling
the faeries dive for cover in the arched opening of the kitchen doorway at the bottom of the ramp
the barrels crunch into the kitchen wall
because they are larger than the doorway the faeries crouching inside are spared
oceans of wine flood out in a dark tidal wave forcing the door and washing the little people into the corridor beyond
brown tom is beside himself with delight
he scoops up wine with screwballs helmet and pours it on top of his head
brown tom whoopeeeeeee
jack appears in the shattered doorway sword in hand
jack hate to break up the party but theres work to be done
gump jumps to his feet
get those plates jack sheathes his sword and rushes into the kitchen
screwball and blunder follow but brown tom lingers behind scooping the helmet full of wine
brown tom just a wee taste
gump kicks brown tom smartly in the pants
or i make your head ring worse than any hangover
gump chases brown tom back into the kitchen
the faeries gather up the fallen plates
jack stares thoughtfully at the fireplace where the body of the second cook has snuffed out the flames
gump whats on your mind jack
jack smoke rising
that chimney must go clear to the top
gump peers into the hearth
gump not much to hold onto
take a peapod pixie to make the climb
screwball steps proudly forward
screwball ill do it
the faeries are astonished
screwball never volunteers
can i believe my ears
screwball dont see why not
aint i small enough for the job
blunder proudly no jobs too small for the buttercup brothers
screwball on his knees please gump
let me try
i know im always trouble but i want to make it up to you
prove that i wont let you down
brown tom be sure ya dont fall down
gump all right
but be swift
screwball thank you
youll never regret it
jack boosts screwball up into the chimney
jack im proud of you screwball
handing him a plate dont drop it
gump calling up well send luna with a signal when all is ready
screwball clings to the smoke blackened bricks staring up the nearly endless shaft at a small circle of light far above
brown tom os calling from below always knew youd be going places screwball
screwball to himself im goin places all right
straight to the top and on outta this hell hole
no more kitchen
no more demons
just the easy life for screwball buttercup
a shining gold plate is propper on the secnd cook smouldering in the fireplace
luna positions another plate against the bellows taking care to get the angle right
gump stands between the bellows and the shattered kitchen door measuring the nagle with a curious hand held instrument
gump little more to the left luna
just a touch more
blunder and brown tom run off carrying armloads of plates
jack leans a platter against the corridor wall adjsuting it precisely
jack calling hows that gump
gump os dead centre
lilis tears have dried
she prowls the majestic hall with regal dignity
something magic occurs at the baquet table each crystal goblet fills mysteriously with black wine as she passes every empty bowl and platter suddenly is heaped with an incredible things
to eat all of it black
the food is beautiful in spite on its colour
lili stares a it with undisguised hunger
some animal instinct warns her not to trust this gleaming ebony feast but shes famished and snatches up an apple bright as ploish anthracite
darkness os good
lili gasps dropping the apple
darkness sits in one of the twin grostesque thrones flanking the hearth
darkness cont the food is for your enjoyment
lili i dont want it
im not hungry
darkness do you lie just to please me
lili i do nothing for your pleasure
darkness gestures to the opposing throne
darkness you are so like a child milady
sit and well talk
lili makes no move towards the chair
darkness cont gently like a child you expect anger and defiance will upset me
these are the qualities i admire most
lili snarls fangs gleaming in the firelight
id love to rip out your throat yet it would pain you more if i licked your hand
darkness all i desire is that you sit in that chair and talk with me
lili approaches the grotesque throne
like some impossible organism it pulses in anticipation
lili i prefer to stand
for a moment darkness nearly sucumbs to anger
the viens in his forehead throb
his talons grip his throne in a spam of fury
darkness snarling sit
darkness shrewdly realises rage wont work and he relaxes with a twisted smile
as you wish
its enough that were alone together
just the two of us
across the great hall from the blazing hearth is an identical fireplace
this one is cold but not empty
covered with soot and as black as a moor screwball climbs into view between the massive andirons
darkness cont os all of time awaits us
why not make a start
screwball puts down his plate and tiptoes into the great hall towards the banqueting table
lili os a start at what
darkness leans forward in his throne smiling at lili
darkness simple conversation
lili what do we possibly have to talk about
lili i have no interest in your foul ambition
darkness desire then
surely we beasts all have desire
unseen screwball climbs up onto the banquet table
he cant believe his good fortune
a bounteous feast surrounds him
lili os youd never dream what i desire
darkness os dont be so sure
dreams are my speciality screwballs stuffs his tunic with black fruit
he rushes about treading on the feast in his crazed delirium at beung surrounded by such plenty
darkness cont os it is through dreams i influence mankind
i have dreams of my own
dreams of enternity with you
no more silence
no more loneliness
lili laughs in the face of darkness
lili scornfully such drivel
you sound like some simpering schoolboy
darkness ill wager there was a time when the attention of a devoted schoolbvoy were entirely to your liking
lili regards her claws with a savage sneer
lili snarling i know what id do with such meat now
all things change lady
the pleasures of youth become the regrets of maturity
a loud crash on the banquet table causes darkness to look around
he sees screwball standing by the centrepiece about to shove a whole chicken in his mouth
darkness cont angry whatre you doing here
blackened with soot screwball easily passes for a goblin
screwball all innocence
am i early
darkness you impudent imp
screwball i thought the invitation said half past
darkness roaring get out
screwball gets the message
he drops the chicken and hops down off the banquet table running to the opposite fireplace for all hes worth
darkness cont gently to lili sit
i value your thoughts
why not share them with me
lili looks at the grotesque throne
lili no more than that
darkness nodding sit
lili steps up onto the oversized footstool
inches behind her the monstrous throne swells and throbs like an organic creature the powerful sinews rippling with desire
lili a feline smile doesnt seem such an outrageous request
the princess prepares to sit her luscious silk swathed bottom only inches from the lavcivious surface of the squirming throne
darkness youll never regret granting me this favour
lilis eyes glitter as she teases him
lili what shall we talk about
darkness impatient just sit
the febric of lilis gown brushes the writihing throne
in another second she will be sitting
unexpectedly she stands up tall on the footstool
lili such a disagreeable chair
must be terribly uncomfortable
i think ill stand if you dont mind
darkness barely controls his raging anger
darkness i prefer you to sit
lili id rather stand thank you
darknesss forehead swells with fury
darkness puffs like an adder in his frenzy rising up to tower over lili
darkness roaring i command you to sit
lili is utterly unafraid
she laughs at the swollen image of darkness
lili dont be silly
lili hops down from the footstool
darkness screaming with rage sit damn you
lili sashays past him twitching her gown in an unashamedly wanton fashion
her hearty laugh is as loud as the outraged roars of darkness
lili laughing never
jack scales a plate like a golden discus across the chasm to brown tom waiting on the viaduct above
jack hurls another plate
suddenly the winged monster hatched from the walking egg glides shrieking from the shadows
it catches the plate in its saw toothed beak and dives at jack
gump sees it first
dropping the plate the winged monster rips at jack
the green man draws his sword and defends himself
the fight is savage and brief
jack hacks the monster out of the air
it lies flapping and broken at his feet
gump touches him sympathetically on the arm
im all right
lets get on
to the dungeon
gump pensive you have power within i never imagined
darkness stares at the princess in a towering rage
she flirtatiously pretends to be interested in a bit of fruit before rejecting it in favour of another which also proves not to her liking
darkness im not above my own little pranks milady
should you have a taste for them
lili no doubt theyre as foul as the stuff you set on your table
darkness relaxes taking his cue from lilis mocking tone
or fair such distinctions are entirely arbitrary my dear
does not the lowly toad think his mate fair warts and all
lili do you suggest i will think you fair some day
darkness in time
and time we surely have
stretching before us
like a merciful curtain closing off the past
darkness moves gracefully to lilis side and kneels before her
darkness cont i beseech you
do not reject my foods as you do my food
never have i abased myself so before another
it is not humility that brings me low mistress
darkness aye love
you think my heart a barren desert where only hate can flower
a much finer blossom show its petals now
nourished by sorrow
watered with your tears
baring his breast i offer you this rose princess
lili is astonished
she walks away to consider what darkness has said
darkness watches her slyly
his expression reveals his words to have been a ruse
he gloats in anticipation
lili turns back to face him
darkness immediately resumes his look of adoration
lili you dizzy me lord
i never thought to hear the word love spoken again
darkness youll hear it forever
shouting i love you
lili if such is true
hope is yet alive
regarding her claws these talons can caress as well as kill
they are interrupted by the sound of a chime
an unseen clocks tolls the hour
darkness stares up into the shadows
darkness it grows late
the setting sun blazes through distant drifting clouds tinting the sky in a riot of colours
another chime is heard
the sound of the unicorns frightened whinny carries up from the dungeons below
darkness laughing our wedding feast is in good voice
think you not
lili cunningly disguises her alarm
lili i admire your thrift my lord both the meal and entertainment in a single dish
darkness appreciates this joke
darkness are you anxious to see blood flow
lili as you are to drink it
smiling slyly will the groom grant his bride her wish on this night
darkness beaming with pleasure you have but to ask my savage beauty
lili leers baring her feline teeth
lili i want to kill the unicorn
darkness claps his hands with joy
darkness lady you make me proud
screwball struggles up the endless chimney past hideous gargoyles and ancient skeletons imbedded in the blackened bricks
the sounds of conversation carry up from below
lili os i will do it with joy
let the unicorns blood anoint our love
screwball crumpets and candlesticks
shes gonna kill it
and in the eternity awaiting us i will happily sit on your throne as befits the queen of darkness
screwball i cant let that happen
why its not civilized
clutching the golden plate screwball struggles upwards like a tiny mountaineer
he reaches into a grinning skull for a handhold and the jaws clamp shut on his fingers
screwball cont billygoat dumplings
screwball yanks his hand free nearly losing his balance
his terror gives him renewed energy and he scrambles frantically up the inside of the chimney
the chimney pot is shaped like a monstrous demon
black as a sweep screwball emerges at the top and looks around
the distant sun is a dying ember resting on the surrounding rim of dark mountains
we hear the sound of a clock chime
a distant chime stops gump in his tracks
he pulls out his timepiece from the pouch and studies it
not much time
princess lili stretches out her arms towards darkness
lili bring me to the wretched beast
darkness takes her arm and leads her towards the blazing hearth
the unicorns distant whinny echoes from below
darkness this way fair beauty
i hear a throat begging to be cut
lili hesitates when she realises darkness intends to lead her straight into the flames
lili fearful no
darkness steps into the leaping flames
he turns and takes lilis hand
darkness now you are my queen
nothing is impossible
it takes but a single step
find the faith
darkness looks deep into lilis eyes
she places her tiny foot among the white glowing coals
not even the fur is singed
her fear vanishes
she stands at the side of her master
darkness wraps a powerful arm about the girl and they are consumed by flames becoming one with the blaze around them
unseen by the deformed goblin guards the faeries creep out of the shadows and take cover behind a squat stone column
jack positions blunder in the corridor entrance with the final plate before joining the others
jack everythings ready
gump and you jack
your greatest challenge is still to come
darkness and princess lili emerge arm in arm out of a background curtain of fire
they sweep majestically down the stone steps to where the unicorn is chained
silent as mice jack and the faeries peer around at them
jack is horrified by lilis bestial appearance
gump judge her with your heart not your eyes
blix and poxand the other goblin guards scramble to attention as the regal pair ascends
pox s s s salutations
prepare the unicorn for sacrafice
the goblins hurry to comply
blix selects a grotesque black greatsword from among a rack of weapons
pox furiously pedals a grindstone
blix applies the blade
showers of sparks shower onto the glistening floor
behind the column the watching faeries are desparate
lunas glowing light hovers above their heads
brown tom the game is lost
for all of jacks pretty plan
fly up to screwball
tell him its time
quick as a flash luna streaks off into the shadows
blix carries the sharpened greatsword to darkness offering it with a low bow
let the ritual begin
the demon guards stand in a semi circle around the unicorn
blix and pox open tattered black prayer books
darkness steps to a twisted lectern and reads from a sinister volume
darkness in the beginning there was nothing
a void of darkness a cold enternity of silence
pox endless night black as death
mother of shadows protect us
the assembled guards answer in a ghastly chorus chorus of guards mother of shadows renew us
pox dream sister
eclipse our pain
chorus of guards night bride
restore our strength
luna blazes straight up out of the abysmal keep a tiny shooting star
the demons ceremony continues os darkness os
and when the perfect void was corrupted by light a great wailing was heard and all the brethern fled in terror
luna rockets along the ruined corridors of the labyrinth
chorus of guards os deliver us o darkness from all fear
darkness steps forward
his booming voice disturbs the sleeping abts and sends them wheeling in clouds around his head
darkness hear me ye powers of the night
we offer this sacrafive in honour of you
darkness reaches up and seizes a fluttering bat from out of the air
darkness cont here is our offering
sanctified with blood
darkness crushes the bat to a pulp and splatters the unicorns white flank with its blood
darkness struggles mentally with the mare
and with fire
darkness touches his fingertip to the unicorns haunch
the hide smoulders instantly leaving an ugly brand
chorus of guards blood and fire born of night
blood and fire drown the light
the unicorn rears back
her hooves clatter on the cold stones
darkness i pray you father accept my sacrafice
let light be orever extinguished
let the age of darkness begin
darkness contorts with the strain on imposing his will on the unicorn
he dominates the mare and she grows calm
as the demon guards chant blix and pox strain at the winch
they drag the unicorns towards the chopping block
screwball stands watching the sunset
one hands holds the plate the other polishes a black apple on his tunic
screwball singing under his breath nickety nackety
noo noo noo
the apple is bright as obsidian
screwball smiles at his reflection on its gleaming surface
screwball cont singing
fiddle dee widdle dee
screwball takes a big bite of the apple
screwball grins chewing happily
not a care in the world
it hits him like a stroke
his eyes cross and he toppes dropping the plate
luna comes blasting out of the chimney like a tracer bullet
luna tiny voice screwball
screwball falls onto the rim of the chimney
in a brilliant burst of light luna materialises into her grown self catching the plate an instant before it drops over the edge
luna cont do it
luna looks sadly down on screwball touching him with her toe
luna cont screwball
screwball snores loudly
luna cont oh screwball
luna aims the golden plate at the ruby blaze of the setting sun
she aims a beam of light straight down the chimney
the beam of light descends the dark shaft like a golden waterfall
the beam of light moves like a searchlight inside the fireplace criss crossing the second cooks body as it misses the propped plate he holds by inches
working together the two goblins turn the iron winch
bit by bit the cable is drawn forward onto the drum
the unicorns neck is stretched across the block
darkness stands before lili offering the greatsword
darkness once your hands were too delicate for such a task
spinning and weaving were more their work
lili let my loom be made of flesh and blood
i am sister to the fates
lili eagerly seizes the sword
darkness what a queen youll make
jack slumps against the wall desparate
jack come on screwball
gump she means to do it jack
shes one of them
jack stares at lili
gump grabs a long black bow from a weapon rack and an arrow from a quiver beside it
gump cont im going to stop her
jack gump wait
i trust her
gump fits an arrow onto the bowstring
the unicorn is helpless before lili
blix locks the winch securing the cable
darkness my lady the birth of a new world awaits your stroke
lili swings the greatsword high over head
chorus of guards chanting blood and fire
blood and fire
gump draws back the arrow in the longbow aiming at lili
jack grabs the bow
he and gump struggle for the weapon
the beam of light hits the plate held by the second cook in the fireplace
it streaks across the the plate leaning on the bellows zigzagging out into the corridor
the beam of light zooms out of the corridor strikes the plate on the viaduct and reflects down into the lowest depths of the castle
gump is determined to shoot lili
jack equally determined to stop him
jack i trust her gump
ill always trust her
gump foolish mortal
the beam of light streams in through the corridor
blunder reflects it off his plate towards the others
struggling for the bow jack and gump kick over the propped shielf the moment the light beam reaches it
brown tom stop lads
a wild laugh bursts from lilis throat
she swings the sword with all her might
the blade arcs through the air a glittering sunburst where it carves through the deflected beam of light
lili aims not for the mare but for the line restraning her
the sword severs the woven cable
lili exultant run
the unicorn plunges into the shadows
only the echo of her hoofbeats remain
jack and gump stop struggling
jack dives for his fallen shield
darkness pulls a weapon from his belt
it is the stallions alicorn mounted as a shortsword
darkness sneering savagely innocence
huge and terrible darkness lunges for lili driving the alicorn straight through her side
lili is pierced by the horn
she gasps supported by the demons hold on the blade
miraculously lilis features alter and transform
the fangs and claws disappear
her fur melts like the morning dew
she is an innocent maiden once more
lili slides dying off the alicorn and falls to the ground
jack holds his shield in the beam of light angling in a bright swath towards darkness
you evil bastard
the light hits darkness like an express train
he howls blasted in a smoking whirlwind across the dungeon
darkness cowers on his knees screaming in the light
all the goblins scatter howling from the light
brown tom capers a happy two step around gump who stares straight up into the central keep
and well dance on the black devils grave
gumps pov looking up the beam of light dims and goes out
brown tom os whats wrong
whats happening gump
gump shrugs looking sadly at jack and the darkened shield he holds
gump sadly sunset
with a savage snarl darkness staggers off into the gloon trailing trendrils of smoke
jack drops the shield and rushes to lilis side
he kneels and cradles her in his arms
throwing back his head jack howls like a wild animal
his cry is a wolf wail of utter despair
gump runs frantically up to grieving green man
gump no jack
hes after the mare
gump seizes the grotesque sacraficial greatsword
gump cont the world needs a champion
handing jack the black sword use this against him
jack snatches the sword
he rises cold with fury and runs off into pursuit of darkness
the unicorn gallops through a desolate landscape of broken columns and grumbled masonry
a precipice jutting over eternity
the unicorn runs along a narrow trail bordering the edge of the abyss highlighted by a bright backdrop of comets and stars
close on the black hooves of darkness as he runs relentlessly along the unicorns track
pull back to show darkness transformed into a muscular black unicorn stallion
he surges onward an explosion of strength
flames flare from his nostrils
the huge black unciron thunders out of the cavern mouth
the mare stand alone trapped on a final promontory
the black stallion rears and charges the mare
black and terrible the devil stallion rises over the mare striking out with his fearsome hooves
the mare staggers before this onslaught of evil falling to the ground amid flying black feet
the black stallion paws the ground preparing to ram his alicorn into the fallen mare
jack runs out from the dark cavern gripping the evil greatsword with both hands
he sees the stallion tower above the mare jack calling out darkness
you rotten filth
the superb black unicorn turns to meet this new challenge
he snorts breathing fire and lowers his head charging straight at jack
jack stands his ground greatsword poised as the huge black stallion gallops towards him hooves striking spark
jack swings with all his might as the demon unicorn roars slavering past
the greatsword passes straight through the black beast as if it were striking a ghost
jack is knocked off balance by the fury of the charge but he manages to stay on his feet as the stallion wheels and attackes again
the black unicorns red eyes blaze as he crashes into jack
the green man is thrown awkwardly to one side
he loses the greatsword and sprawls helpless on the ground
dazed jack rises on his elbows
he sees the black hooves of darkness standing before him
looking up jack sees the lord of darkness transformed back to his original form
he holds his alicorn sword pointed straight at the boys heart
darkness always a pleasure to take a brave mans life
darkness thrusts down with the alicorn but jack rolls skillfully aside and counds to his feet
havent killed me yet
jack draws his own sword and swings at darkness who parries with the alicorn
jack swings again
darkness catches the blade in his bare hand and holds jack immobile to meet his malevolent gaze
oh but i have
jack is speechless with horror
darkness cont dont you know me boy dont you know from whence i come
the muscle hump behind darknesss neck bulges and cracks
it bursts open and a pair of leathery bat wings unfold
jacks horror is complete
darkness cont time to die
darkness drives the alicorn sword into jacks chest running him through
jacks eyes are wide with astonishment
is this what its like to die
darkness pulls the alicorn out of jack
there is no blood
no trace of a wound remains on his flesh
jack blinks in wordless amazement
darkness cont so
i should have known
were just the same
youre immortal jack
jack disbelieving no
darkness laughing who was your mother
jack confused i
darkness who was your father
darkness how long have you lived in the forest
jack all my life
know who i am
darkness you pitiful fool
an immortal all this time and never knew
laughing dont you see jack
dont you understand your power
together we could rule the universe
darkness thered be nothing to stop us
no power could stand in our way
were just the same jack
you and i
jack struggles to understand the immensity of this revelation
he wavers in the face of the demons persuasiveness
all at once the mare unicorn gallops up from the shadows white and pure
she spears darkness straight his mid section
the evil lord screams staring down at the shining alicorn thrsut out of his chest
darkness starts to shrink
the mare lifts the writhing demon high in the air impaled like a kicking insect
rearing the unicorn arches her neck and tosses darkness over toe edge into the abyss
darkness tumbles into the haze
his final howl is a lament from the depths of hell
at the last moment the falling figure of darkness transforms into the flapping black cloak and sails off into the shadows
jack picks up the alicorn
he wraps his other arm around the unicorns neck
they stand together at the edge of the world united in a victorious embrace
the faeries gather at the entrance
screwball is there half asleep
luna is full sized
pale and sleeping lili lies on the black cloak
the faeries stand around her eyes downcast
jack rides up mounted on the unicorn
surrounded by light he is more than a champion
he is divine
the faeries are delighted
solved your riddle at last
brown tom shouldve known no mortal could speak unicorn like that
jack how is lili
gump sadly beyond the help of faerie magic
shes under a powerful spell
its like a riddle
he brightens into a smile
jac i know the answer
lift her to me gently
jack hands gump the alicorn as the faeries gather lili in their arms lifting her above their heads
jack carefully pulls the enchanted princess in front of him across the unicorns withers
jack cont well meet again dear friends
jack touches his heels to the unicorns flanks and they gallop off in a clatter of hoofbeats
gump waving ride like the wind jack
brown tom wish we could go with him
gump and why not
i know some magic words thatll do the trick
screwball oh no
i hate to travel like that
makes me sick
gump stand back
the skys the limit
screwball cant stand your bumpy takeoffs
abruptly screwball shoots into the air flying out of sight
wait for the spell
i never do
gump gestures magically
gump eiderdown and milkfeed fluff
all at once gump blunder and brown tom streak off into space
luna watches them go
transforming into a dot of light she speeds up after them
jack clings to lili as the unicorn thunders through the midnight forest darting like quicksilver between the shadowy trees leaping impossible chasms splashing across streams in a burst of moonlit
the full moon hangs above like the lantern of god as the faeries tumble through the clear night sky
gump rides the alicorn like a broomstick
far below magically white and fluid as free roving moonbeam the unicorn carries her passengers across the nocturnal forest with the ease of a dreamer transported through time
it is not yet sun up
the first faint trace of the false dawn tints the eastern horizon
everywhere the snow is melting
it is like springtime with bold patches of green showing through the frozen landscape
a bright beam of light approaches weaving between the giant trees
it is jack and lili mounted on the unicorn
jack rides up onto the high rock overinghanfing the ponnd and slides easily to the ground with lili in his arms
the unicorn doesnt move
she stands watching as jack gently rests lili down on the mossy earth
jack strips off his golden mail coat and steps on the edge of the promontory
he dives gracefully into the pond
screwball in the lead the faeries crash down through the trees bouncing to a stop on the forest floor
brown tom ouch
gump cheerfully home again
the bedraggled faeries scowl at gump
jack streaks down streaming air bubbles like a comets tail
the faeries gather around the frozen unicorn stallion
his alicorn has been restored
wreathed in flowers it stands majestically out from his forehead
jack strokes deeper and deeper into the pond past undulating weeds and curious fish
faeries are all about dancing and singing around the statuesque unicorn
they pelt one another with petals
the mare stands demurely to one side draped in blossoms
at the bottom jack moves carefully trying not to stir up the muck
he gently parts the drifting trendrils searching among the water weeds
high above the faerie celebration beautiful music is heard
it is gump playing his violin in uppermost branches of a towering pine
delicate as the call of a meadow lark gumps music rises sweetly into the heavens
it is just dawn
the suns glow blazes in the east
a winking gleam catches jacks eyes and he reaches out an eager hand
a cloud silt issues from his grasp as he opens his fingers
centred on his palm golden and perfect is lilis ring
round and full the sun rises
the golden sun rays pierce through the trees and start across the open meadow
gumps music continues more lyrical than ever
as the sunlight advances bright spring flowers push up through the once frozen earth
jack turns and strokes upwards higher and higher towards the shining ceiling of light far above
gumps music swells to a crescendo
the life giving sunlight reaches across the meadow and strikes the flank of the dormant stallion
jack breaks the surface holding the ring triumphantly above his head
the princess sleeps under the tree
she no longer wears the black wedding gown but is dressed as before
jacks armour has also disappeared
jack kneels before lili and slips the ring onto her finger
he takes the girl into his arms and kisses her passionately on the mouth
her eyelids flutter
the unicorns sunlit flesh twitches dislodging a butterfly warming his wings on his haunch
in a single beautiful movement the stallion rises to his feet
he arches his powerful neck and calls to his mate
the magic animals gallop off together across the open meadow
princess lili awakens
what a dream ive had
the princess smiles when she sees the ring on her finger
lili cont such a terrible dream
i could never tell you
lili looks around but jack is nowhere in sight
lili cont jack
where are you
calling green jack
getting no reply lili wanders off in search of jack
puzzled lili searches the familiar place
lili calling jack
where are you hiding now
the wind surges through the treetops
the leaves all move together as if they were a single living organism
jacks voice is heard out of the waving trees
jack os im everywhere lili
my spirit lives in everything
dont play games with me
i love you
jack os i
lili will you be here tomorrow
unseen in the bushes gump and the faeries hide grinning as they watch lili
jack os im always here lili
whenever you come
mystified but happy princess lili picks a flower and wanders off into the sun bright woods
a lush broad expanse boldly pattered with wild flowers
breasting the waving grass like a swimmer in the sea the unicorn bounds joyfully in total freedom
mounted on the animals back his arms in victory jack rides like a triumphant angel
his hair and skin are tinted green
he is the incarnation of all that is magical in nature
