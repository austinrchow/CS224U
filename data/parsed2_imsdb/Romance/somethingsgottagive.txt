nancy meyers june
we hear ja rules livin it up
a brunette beauty crosses in front of a stack of cabs her sheer dress clinging to her remarkable body
a club in the meatpacking district
a long line waits to get in
a couple of gorgeous girls show up at the velvet rope and are promptly let inside
a crowd spills out of a bar and onto the sidewalk
a confident knock out in jeans and a tank top laughs drinking a beer out of the bottle
the sweet uncomplicated satisfaction of the younger woman
that fleeting age when everything just falls right into place
its magic time and it can render any man anywhere absolutely helpless
some say im an expert on the younger woman
guess thats cause ive been dating them for over forty years
what is it about him
could be his eyes the turn of his mouth
something about this guy is just so damn appealing
maybe its just the way he wears the young slinky girl on his arm
hes confident cool enviable
were in the place is full
everybody is somebody here
to hostess langer
the maitred snaps to attention at the sight of him
langer got your table waiting
as harry and his girl wend their way around tables we pass other couples
middle aged couples
not talking couples
so what does a life of bucking the system all add up to
to never settle down with the right woman for a life of leftovers and christmas mornings
no his and her ira accounts no mini van parked in the garage
i think its made me what i am today
harry smiles to someone across the room the luckiest son of a bitch on earth
look at me
im positively debonair
i should be illegal im lookin so good
harry passes a table where a beaten sixty year old dines with his age appropriate well fed wife
in slow motion harry and the beaten man catch each others glance
it isnt as if i havent wondered what my life would be like if i was a regular joe and came in here once a month with a dame my
age for a porterhouse and a side of i spinach
harry enters all over again
this time he looks older something in his walk and the boxy cut of his jacket
with him is a regular looking nothing to write home about woman no come on lets be honest
a dame really my age
again the identical set up
harry enters again
this time he looks ten years older
the bounce to his step is gone
the twinkle in his eye long dead
on his arm is a year old battle ax built just like harry
the maitred reluctantly shows them to a shitty table
there you have it
the story in a nutshell
not exactly debonair am i
harry trips his wife looks disgusted awww man its down right sad
look at me
i look like im about to die
god help me
i do not want to die
a silver mercedes convertible bursts into frame
harrys behind the wheel shades smoking a cigar livin large
next to him sits a thoroughbred of a girl
an it girl
smart sexy and built for fun
she has perfected flirting to an art
her hand rests on harrys neck
theres a good thirty year age difference between them
her name is marin
she sings along with ja rule now coming from a cd
singing to all my thugs that be livin it up we say what i do
to all my
this is it
make a right
admiring the neighborhood so baby youre rich
well my mother is sort of
if she lives within a mile of here shes rich
i guess a hit play will buy you a house in the hamptons
id like to meet your mother
no you wouldnt
i mean shes great
shes totally brilliant but shes not your type
youre overlooking one of the great things about me
i dont have a type
very directly shes over thirty
harry looks to marin feigning hurt
like you dont know you have a slight reputation for
just then the car phone rings
harry keeps looking at marin
he doesnt look away
for never dating anyone over
dont look at me like that
its just not true
oh so you wait til we get out to the hamptons to let me know youre a wise ass
answers phone hold on
then to marin it just so happens my dear that women of a certain age dont date me
you ever think of it that way
no its always me
you dames are all alike
then into phone hey
amused to herself dames
marin continues singing along with ja rule as harry confidently slips his hand onto her thigh
into phone vh huh
ill call back monday
say you couldnt find me
glances at marin shes not listening ill call her later
no i have it
harry hangs up doesnt look in marins direction to see if she caught that
this brand of cool is about not playing that card
marin turns toward him she has been listening
theyve reached the end of the road sand dunes long lilting grass and the ocean stretch before them
all business make a right left at the second fence
marin turns up the cd getting herself out of whatever just came over her looks out the window
have i mentioned how gorgeous your breasts look in this sweater
blushing yes you have actually
so it would be too much to mention it again
marin laughs softening as harry turns down a dirt driveway driving toward a dream beach house
its the perfect beach house
my mother doesnt know how to do things that arent perfect
which explains you
that got her
she looks over at him but hes grabbing some cigars for his shirt pocket then looks up at her with an innocent look that suggests he did not just say
such a lovely thought
trying to keep up with him yeah okay right
they both grab their h overnight bags and step out of the car
so what are we gonna do out here just the two of us for two whole days
marin sets her bag down walks to harry wraps her arms around his neck
tell me the truth are you at all glad we waited
im incredibly glad were finally going to do it
shes a bit disappointed if thats the same as being glad we waited then baby doll im ecstatic
marin smiles then kisses him
hes one of those guys that lets you kiss them
slaps her tush lets go for a swim how long will it take you to change
marin starts unbuttoning her sweater as she dances seductively toward the front door then notices harrys cigars
no smoking in the house
my mom doesnt allow it
but she allows you to strip in the front yard and bring men youre dating here to
she doesnt know everything i do
or when i do it
or where i do it
she slips off her sweater and drops it on harrys head
its one of those great beach houses
light filled and warm with spectacular views of the sandy landscape wrapping around the rear of the house
marin now in a tight tank tight pants gives harry the grand tour as she continues to undress
taking off her belt the fabulous living room perfect for entertaining an intimate group of friends or that special someone
drops her belt then unbuttons harrys shirt behind me the requisite hamptons deck complete with pool and ocean view
unbuckles harrys belt your pants please
marin provocatively unzips her pants and wriggles out of them
shes now in a tiny tank and bikini panties
gourmet kitchens to your left where tonight i will whip you up a culinary feast of mac and cheese
marin hears harrys zipper unzip
she turns her eyes widening as harrys pants land on a chair
harry is now down to his boxers an open shirt and a fearless smile
smiling o kay going quickly now
master bedroom is that away
they arrive in a warmly decorated guest bedroom
and this as they say on cribs your favorite show is where the magic happens
do we like it
going once going twice
harry takes marins hand and pulls her out of frame and onto the bed
she playfully rolls on top of him
his hands cup her ass
you know when i first started auctioneering someone told me if i was nervous to just picture everyone in the audience in their underwear
this sort of gives that a whole new meaning
youre not nervous now are you
im always a little nervous
removing his hands so put on your bathing suit
i brought some champagne ill put it on ice
me like you harry langer
she bounces off him like a kid and disappears into the bathroom
harry lies there alone for a second
catches his breath
he sits up feet on the floor shoulders hunched clears his throat bangs on his chest
he waits a sec then stands with a stiffness that for the first time suggests he is not a that young man
now wearing only his boxer shorts harry crosses through the living room singing livin it up to himself
he reaches into his bag and lifts out two bottles of crystal
he sees himself in the mirror sucks in his gut
well stocked the best of everything
harry opens the door to the fridge and just as he disappears behind it the back door opens and two women enter from a beach walk in the middle of
a lively conversation
one of them is erica marins mother
the other is ericas younger sister zoe
erica is in her mid fifties and is a poster girl for growing old
its actually hard to imagine looking any better
and not because she looks but because she makes look graceful and right
erica is the girl most likely who went beyond expectations but didnt realize until recently that being sure of herself was a handicap
she doesnt try to be intimidating she just is
her sister zoe is in her forties
zoes the loose one
she wears draw string pants and a t shirt that says boys lie
the women stop mid sentence when they notice the refrigerator is wide open
then they see a pair of bare mens legs poking out from under the door
they don t move
what is this
erica nods to zoe gesturing a nearby knife
zoe grabs the knife
harry pokes his head out from behind the fridge equally confused
in control okay stay right where you are
we have a knife
eyeing the knife do you
okay mister look im gonna dial and youre not gonna move
zoe hand me the phone
reaches out to zoe without looking at her you dont understand
im a friend of your daughters
with that harry shuts the fridge door
the women see hes naked except for a pair of boxers
they both gasp
zoe fumbles the phone over to erica who dials quickly
i dont think so
my daughters in the city and you what wandered in here like high on ecstasy
looks at phone shit
redials calmly starts to move honestly if you just
she was in the israeli army
she can break you in half
zoe cant believe she just said that no truth in it whatsoever
into phone yes
i have an intruder in my house
daniels lane sagaponack
im dating your daughter marin
she invited me here for the weekend
shes in her room right now changing
gasps even louder really scared now youre dating my daughter
amused now who wouldve thought that would be worse news
with that marin enters in a tiny bikini sees harry in his shorts zoe holding the knife and erica frozen holding the phone
into phone im sorry
yeah no im sure
no hes not a burglar with enormous difficulty hes dating my daughter
mom i had no idea you were coming out this weekend you said you had to write
i thought id do it out here
oh man this is really
starts laughing you gotta admit sorta funny you thought he was a burglar
in his boxer shorts
yeah well the worlds nuts i dont know the man
still laughing im sorry its not really funny
im an idiot
i shouldve told you i was bringing someone out
no no i shouldve told you we were coming
anyway here we are
waves to harry hello
im the mother
all three women turn to harry who now dangles a long lobster shaped oven mitt over his privates
how are ya
mom this is my friend harry
harry my mom erica
my aunt zoe
they all shake hands harrys sort of a new friend
i think i mentioned him in an e mail
we just totally spur of the moment thought wed get out of the city for a few days
cant look at him honey does harry have a robe
backing out you know what
actually i think i should just take off
let you gals enjoy your weekend
marin shoots her mom a look
no no no
dont be silly
uh look heres what well do
zoe and i will leave
we took a great walk on the beach well go into town for lunch
you two stay
harry apologize about the near arrest
no you were impressive
very strong very
a little thrown i dont think i was exactly macho trust me if i ever catch a guy in his underwear in my refrigerator i hope im half the man
you were mrs uh
already hating him yeah
all righty then
im definitely gonna hit the road
salutes erica and zoe ladies
sensational meeting you
then to marin doll call me
lets not get so dramatic here
what are we four teenagers
were all sophisticated people
why cant we all stay for the weekend
your mothers got work to do ive got papers to grade
youll do your thing whatever that is and if we want to hang together well hang together
if we dont we dont
theres no reason why any of us should give up this spectacular weekend
i can handle it
i can totally handle it
on the spot i mean well i can handle it
the women all look to harry
he looks at marin
shes hard to resist
it can only go up from here
walking past shops on the main drag in east hampton
they are both licking ice cream cones
camera stays behind them
hes obviously a penis substitute
are paced feet behind them carrying groceries
i mean a father substitute
except hes older than her father
i cant even look at them
what is she doing with a guy that age
marin was how old when you guys broke up
five years ago so
okay so she was old enough not to feel dave was walking out on her
is that supposed to mean dave walked out on me
why do people assume when you break up after twenty years that the guys the one who wanted out
just because once we broke up he shtupped everything that moved
i didnt mean it that way
just trying to figure out why such a smart girl is always with the wrong guy
barry que je puis vous obtenir aujourdhui
the girl stands behind the cheese counter in a gourmet market in east hampton
the clientele in here is as rich looking as the food
erica stands on the other side of the cheese counter
bonjour je veux une partie de votre pate merveilleux et de votre meilleur fromage absolu de chevre
harry and marin shop near by
harry listens to erica out of one ear
she started french lessons after she and my dad split up
part of her keep busy dont look back program
shes practically fluent now
turning back to marin marin au cas ou nous prende un desset ou devrions jefaire quelgue chose
with an impeccable accent laissons quelque chose dachat
et ce grand gateau de chocolat
hey not bad
i am fluent
be right back
marin crosses to the dessert counter
erica turns back and catches harry checking out marins ass
he smiles as he licks his ice cream
erica rolls her eyes then spots another older guy with a leggy girl twenty five years his junior
its an epidemic
then erica notices whos next to her at the cheese counter
she sees her sister zoe reading a cheese label with her glasses on and next to zoe are two sad looking old women in their eighties with their arms linked
almost woozy erica is snapped out of it when she is handed her package
erica heads down the aisle passing harry whose back is to her
just as she passes he turns and almost bumps into her
backing off woops
they so very badly do not want to actually touch
harry gestures for her to go first then walks alongside her
what do you do
im one of the owners of a record company among other things
which record company
drive by records
appalled at the name drive by records
is that a joke
what is that
its a hip hop label
with disdain okay
let me see if i get where youre headed here
im sorry but look you know i hate rap i mean i do
its sort of violent and crude for my taste not to mention just a tad misogynistic
hey a lot of people see rapping as poetry
yeah but come on how many words can you rhyme with bitch
erica places her groceries on the check out counter
joining harry how we doin
shouldve left when she tried to arrest me
marin serves plates of pasta with lobster
zoe pours wine and erica tosses a salad
harry is the only one sitting
so mom hows the new play
you gettin happy with it
marin places a plate in front of harry then runs her finger along the nape of his neck
they smile at each other as she continues on
erica notices tries not to respond
well the thing with me is that im about hard word talent and so far the talent part hasnt exactly kicked in yet
whats your play about
marin and zoe stop what they are doing and turn to erica
shes hesitant to reveal this
well im not exactly sure which is a bit of a problem but so far its about a divorced woman a writer shes this high strung over amped controlling know
it all neurotic
everyone stares at her whos incredibly cute and lovable
more stares its a comedy
takes a seat next to zoe so how did you two meet
at a wine auction at sothebys
harry was the big buyer of the night
i kept winking at marin as she was conducting the auction and apparently every time i did that she misunderstood and i ended up buying cases of outrageously expensive wine
zoe and marin laugh
ever been married harry
no i havent
now why do you think that is
some people just dont fit the mold
and so far
hey if it aint broke
harry leans back places his arm around marins chair
erica takes note
wait a second arent you like a famous bachelor
i wouldnt say im famous
no i think i read a piece on you in new york magazine
i guess people find it interesting that ive escaped the noose for so long
yeah wasnt the name of the article the escape artist
i read that article
that was you
you were once engaged to somebody big
who was it
not joan collins
yeah it was somebody cool like that
trying to remember not martha stewart
you could just
no this is more fun
its like im not here
harry was once engaged to diane sawyer
i love her
stunned im impressed
yeah women your age love that about me
erica pauses on that one
trying to get thru this you know what i mean
yes i do
its not a bad thing to say women your age
im sure it was a compliment
just the truth
stepping in so when was this engagement
long time ago
she was just this adorable lanky girl from kentucky with the greatest pair of legs id ever seen
never understood her ending up with a job where she never showed them
munches on his lobster
youre not serious
shes diane sawyer she goes into caves in afghanistan with a shmahtah on her head
who cares about her legs
just anyone whos ever had the pleasure of
you know what
i hate to eat and run but
this is actually a very fascinating dynamic whats going on at this table
warning him oe teaches womens studies at columbia
oh so this is gonna hurt
no come on listen heres the rub for women
look at what we have here with you and erica
harry youve been around the block a few times right
around never been married which we all know if you were a woman would be a curse youd be an old maid a spinster blah blah blah
okay so instead of pitying you they write articles about you celebrate your never marrying it makes you illusive and ungettable
youre a real catch
then take my gorgeous sister here
any chance of you stopping here
come on this is interesting
i mean look at her shes so accomplished the most successful woman playwright since who
shes over fifty divorced and still sits in night after night because the available guys her age want to marin
zoe contd forgive me honey for saying this but they want girls that look like marin so the whole over fifty dating scene is geared completely towards men leaving older
women out and as a result that makes the older women more and more productive and more and more interesting which in turn makes them even less desirable because as we all know men especially older men are threatened and deathly afraid of interesting and accomplished women
its just so clear
single older women as a demographic are as fucked a group as can ever exist
erica and harrys eyes connect for a millisecond
hear the over we erica is cleaning up the broken plates zoe leans down to help
what are you possessed
how could you say those things
it just seemed so obvious to me
the injustice of it
thank god men die younger than us
its the only break we get
then you know what
write a dissertation on it dont announce to the world that i stay in night after night after night and by the way one night after night would have been
did you ever realize i stay in as part of my job
why do you think i married the director of my plays
he was the only man i ever saw
anyway i like staying in and i like this time in my life
why do i have to defend myself
m i was married for years
arin enters carrying more dishes
what the hell was that
im sorry i thought i was onto something
honey what are you doing with this guy
hes old hes chauvinistic
how is he fun
wrong can be fun mom
not this wrong
can we not do this now
hes actually incredibly smart and fascinating and if you had talked to him about something other than his marital status you wouldve found out how smart he is
he owns like different companies
what does that mean he owns ten different companies
he cant commit thats what that means
not that god forbid i want him to commit
yeah that i get
anyway he said he thought you two were very spontaneous and nice and then said hes leaving as soon as the sun comes up
his car doesnt have headlights
i have no right to get this nuts
hugs her hes your friend
i love you
hugs her back i love you more
this is obviously a ritual between them
erica kisses marins cheek in a flutter of kisses then marin no chance he said we were nice
they hear music coming from marins bedroom
what are they listening to
i dont care
erica turns on the garbage disposal
zoe sings along lets get it on
erica shoots her a look turns off the garbage disposal doing the dishes with vigor
i know shell never see him after this weekend
she cant commit either
then they hear marin giggling
he does sound fun
admit it hes got something
you felt it right
then they hear marin scream
oh this is nuts
erica covers her ears with her hands
then they hear marin scream moooooommmmmmmmmmmm
did she say mom
erica and zoe bust into the room and find harry
on the floor leaning against the bed a clenched fist on his chest
his shirt is open hes sweating his complexion is grey
marin stands back freaked out afraid to get near him
we were fooling around and he said he felt funny hthen he just collapsed
out of breath its nothing
im okay maybe it was the lobster
does your chest hurt
like an elephants standing on it
to marin call
tell them to send an ambulance
when he shuts his eyes it goes black
he sees marin soft in the background on the phone and erica coming toward him
he hears zoe what are you doing
coming closer mouth to mouth
even in this state he gets that erica is about to place her
mouth on his
his eyes widen in horror he reels back
erica catches this
you fucking guy
she does it anyway
her mouth on his her breath into his lungs over and over
harrys eyes roll back in hi so head
erica pounds on his chest we hear the blare of a as the doors to southampton hospital fly open
paramedics wheel harry through the corridors and into the er with dizzying speed
two nurses jostle harry off the gurney and dr
julian mercer arrives at harrys side
julian is in his early thirties and has finally just graduated out of the you look too young to be a doctor syndrome
julian is a man whose goodness makes him sexy
he wears his hair shaggier than youd expect but then again this is a johns hopkins graduate who chose to live near the beach and work nights
the nurses place oxygen in harrys nose
hook him up to a heart monitor and connect him to an iv
how we doing here
hes had minutes of chest pain nausea shortness of breath blood pressures over pulse respirations
lets get an ekg
langer im dr
are you in any pain right now
the nurse wheels over an ekg machine julian helps hook it up
feel some pressure in my chest
its real tight
can you show me where the pain is
harry clenches his fist over his sternum
what were you doing at the onset of the pain
i was uh kissing a beautiful
watching the monitor where you having intercourse
ense of humor in tact
checks ekg hang a nitroglycerine drip
langer the ekg shows you have a blocked artery which is not allowing enough oxygen to get to the heart muscle
im having a heart attack
were gonna stop it
but i need to know what kind of medications you take
scared shitless i take uh
reading the ekg tape uh huh
any thing else
and a white one for blood pressure
what about viagra
erica marin and zoe arrive in the doorway of the er
harry eyes them
did you take any viagra today
i dont take viagra
dont need viagra
the women grab looks at each other know they shouldnt be there
they turn away
just needed to be sure because i put nitroglycerin into your drip and if you had taken viagra the combo would make your heart leap right out of your body
as he watches the nitroglycerin make its way down the tube and approach his arm
just as the amber liquid is about to enter his bloodstream he yanks the iv out of his arm
the drip is knocked onto the ground
the women shriek as the nurses scurry to clean up
erica and zoe rush out marin hangs back
harry catches the look on her face
lets give him an aspirin and metoprolol mg
sorry had an audience
clutching his chest its okay
it was a great save
to nurse lets start the thrombolytic protocol
units of heparin
langer if this works and i have every reason to believe it will its going to reverse whats going on so there will be little or no damage to your
you with me
julian places his hand on harrys okay here we go
marin paces smoking
zoe leans against the wall
oh man what if he doesnt make it
i dont know who to contact
i dont know his family
ive gone out to dinner with the guy three times
i hardly know him
hes gonna make it
hes like a bulldog
hell make it
this is a nightmare
i go out with a guy whos so old he takes viagra
are you nuts
you go out with a guy whos so old hes having a heart attack
all i can say is thank god it didnt happen when he was inside you
that could be life altering
julian rounds the corner of the corridor
marin rushes toward him her face begging for good news
your dads gonna be okay
oh hes not my dad
then your grandads gonna be okay
throws her arms around him oh thank you so much
but hes not my
oh were not related
hes just a friend
his sweet apologetic smile is not lost on marin
zoe and erica join them
langer did have a mild heart attack
i gave him something to break up the clot in his artery and it worked beautifully
his ekg returned to normal almost immediately which means i dont expect any permanent damage
hes very lucky
shoulders sagging thank you
no whoever got him here so fast should be thanked
another half hour and i dont know if this wouldve worked
marin pats her mom on the back
realizing it all now this was
erica wipes away a tear
nothing could surprise her more
were out of the woods
ive given him something to sleep it might make him a little loopy at first but then it should knock him out
to erica youre mrs
no no im just
im erica barry
he was having dinner at our house
i just met him this afternoon
youre erica barry
what a pleasure
im a huge fan
this is my daughter marin my sister zoe
julian says hi to each then returns his attention fully and devotedly to erica
takes her in
julian pours steaming hot tea into paper cups
sitting in the hospital corridor as julians hand enters her frame and hands her a cup of tea
she looks up at him with more adorableness than most men could handle
she blows on the steam
camera pans to zoe
sitting next to marin
she is also handed a cup of tea
even she softens as she looks up at julian
thank you doctor
this is all beginning to feel a little like the step sisters trying on the glass slipper
until we get to erica not paying any attention at all as she is handed her tea
eyes on erica youre welcome
may i join you
this is very nice of you
first year of medical school you learn what can keep you up all night without making you nuts
green tea beats everything plus its a great antioxidant
turning on the charm so urn do you always work nights
usually two or three a week gives me a chance for a real life during the day
immediately turns back to erica you know i heard you had a place in the hamptons
i really am a very big fan
i honestly think ive seen every play youve ever written
i think some were written before your time
there are some marins never even seen
no im pretty sure ive seen them all and i saw the last one twice
zoe nudges erica as a nurse enters from the er
doctor weve got a walk in may need stitches
rises ill check on mi
if hes asleep you all might want to get some shut eye and come back in the morning
great to meet you erica
the women wave and watch him exit
the second hes gone to marin okay now thats a perfect a guy for you
ive never seen a man less interested in me
or more interested in you
hes thirty years old
no hes older than that
who cares how old he is
i mean hes not my type hes like a gorgeous wholesome doctor but hes perfect for you and hot for you which makes him really perfect
he likes my work
they just stare at her its insane
i would never
off zoes look shut
just then harry stumbles into the corridor in his hospital gown pretty out of it
confused harry turns around a little lost giving the women a full view of his bare ass
the women muffle screams
he faces them
honey i want to go home
can you call lowell to pick me up
is he going to fall
marin freezes looks to her mom for help
erica rushes to harry
harry you have to get back in bed
and i say that as a compliment
you saved my life
kisses her hand soft
then i dont remember your name but i thank you from the bottom of my
he falls on erica totally out of it his head on her breast his mouth open
afraid to breathe ugh
look at this even unconscious hes a lech
the nurses rush out and peel harry off erica
langer you shouldnt be standing
got to take a whiz girls
well take care of that for you mr
harry turns back to the women smiling
he likes that idea
loves that idea
you take care of it for me sweetheart
id like to see that
as he walks away his bare ass shines like a full moon in a desert sky
this is the most insane night of my life
yeah but just admit that was one great ass for a guy that age
a nurse slides the roses down the counter of her station
now what can i do you for
she looks across at a neat as a pin man in his early forties prada suit crisp white shirt dark tie
hes a gershwin tune of a man
a throwback to a kinder world
lowell harrys houseman chef all around man friday

julian enters the nurses station
to julian are we discharging hurricane harry
yes we are
hi im dr

julian exits the nurses station
lowell carrying the flowers follows
he nods to two tall leggy mini skirted assistant types kim and lexi who follow
both pack cell phones note pads carry balloons flowers and shopping bags
and you are
langers houseman chef
well that sounds like a pretty interesting job
never a dull moment
they arrive at where harry lies on the bed dressed and ready to go
he squints as he reads a pamphlet at armss distance called heart attack bouncing back
okay harry looks like were going to have to let you go
harry sits up too fast lies right back down
lowell looks like he might cry
the girls hold back
take it easy kids i just sat up too fast
doc tell them

harry stands and indulges lowell in a deep hug
lowells shoulders shake as he sobs

whispers well pull up the car

harry sits on the bed
marin joins him
harry places his hand on her thigh
all she notices is his hospital bracelet

marin smiles kisses harry on the cheek
down to the cheek
thats big he digests that one come on lets get outta here
harry is wheeled out in a wheelchair marin and a nurse on either side
in the parking lot is a town car with lowell and the girls standing next to it
next to them is erica waiting by her car
shes on her cell phone
harry spots them and tries to get out of the wheel chair before it stops
hold on tarzan were still movin
she stops okay now slow ly
to prove her wrong harry rises quickly
everyone stands by ready to help
look at these faces
will you tell them im fine
as soon as harry spots erica he starts to wobble
everyone grabs for harry as he falls out of frame and the taking harrys pulse as harry lies on the asphalt of the hospital parking lot
lowell the two assistants and marin huddle around
erica steps back a bit
harry im sorry but i think we jumped the gun
cant let you travel quite yet
i aint goin back in there
you dont have to but i cant put you in a car right now and i cant leave you in the parking lot
id like you to stay nearby for a few days and let me keep an eye on you til you get your strength back
doc im out in the middle of the hamptons
where do you want me to go
marin turns to erica who very clearly mouths forget it
the town car sits in the driveway lexi leans on the hood talking on her cell
a market delivery van pulls away as a drugstore delivery van pulls in
a flower delivery kid holding a large bouquet knocks at the front door
harry sits up in bed wearing silk pajamas holding an unlit cigar and is on the phone
zoe enters placing the new bouquet on the already flower filled dresser
lowell lifts a lunch tray off the bed as kim stands nearby on the cell phone
marin packs her bag
into phone just promise me you wont make a decision until we talk
thinking about it aint promising me
okay man im seein you friday
hangs up then to lowell lowell what was that
looking down at the tray your lunch
somebody tell you to starve me to death
kim hands harry the cell phone
into phone rush
no man youre livin the shit
i just got a clean bill of health
kim hands harry a note that says
harry steals a look at marin then nods to kim
erica puts away groceries a little on edge
her back is to a man in his fifties who sits at the island eating a sandwich
he wears sweats and a baseball cap
his natural expression is worried
this is dave
this is the best turkey sandwich i ever had in my life
what kind of mustard is this
not turning around i dont know
all right dont get pissy
its not dijon right
dont get pissy
you say that cause this of course would never happen to you
come out here for peace and quiet and suddenly im a character in a kaufman and hart play
the phone rings and the phone does not stop
phone stops ringing and its never for me
lowell enters with the bed tray
sorry to interrupt
thats fine lowell ill take that
no please allow me
no no ill take it
erica takes the bed tray as lowell exits
the man does not know my name and im doing his dishes
lexi enters all of her
dave suddenly looks alive
she carries an empty water glass
where should i put this
ill take it
and harry has a headache
do you have any tylenol
reaches in cabinet extends her hand to dave hi

erica hands lexi the tylenol she thanks her and exits
holding the water glass where should i put this
its an empty water glass
what are the choices

so youre not ready to show me any pages
im not putting pressure on you im just asking
i havent written a word
im on page twelve and the first eleven pages stink
so you have one good page
then how tall do you think that girl was
before erica can respond marin enters
i didnt know you were here
im just on my way out bubbee
well i was just gonna drive into the city with zoe but if youre driving back id much rather go with you
i have to meet someone before i go
to marin wait wait wait wait
youre leaving zoes leaving the entourage is leaving
and im supposed to stay here with him alone
the doctor said hes sending over a nurse in the morning
thats nineteen hours from now
takes a deep breath okay i can handle this
im just going to get into a zen place play music cook write focus
she never changes
setting him straight yes
maybe thats a good thing
no cars are out front
quiet and peaceful
on the soundtrack we hear the french tune i wish you love sung in french
erica cooks softly singing along in french
smells great in here
surprised erica turns to find harry leaning in the doorway in his pajamas robe and slippers
no ones ever had more gorgeous clothes to sleep in
his presence disarms her
coq au vin
he looks confused chicken cooked in red wine
part of my play takes place in paris so im hoping this helps me think
how you feeling
well i walked all the way in here only bumping into two chairs and an ottoman
everyone bumps into that ottoman
harry appreciates the thought
before it has time to become awkward the phone rings
hey thanks for letting me
answering the phone hello
yes he is
hands the phone to harry into phone hello
erica hates this oh you got the flowers
are they pretty
erica cant stand this
she puts on her glasses and skims her recipe
hey can i call you in a little bit
whats your number doll
spots a pad and pencil harry squints cant see what hes writing
backs his head away from the pad
erica hands him her glasses
slips them on jots down the number okay
call you in a little
harry hangs up and hands the glasses back to erica
look harry its not like in any stretch of the imagination i think youre all that right for my daughter but i dont really appreciate hearing you on the phone
with other women
its like im an accomplice to you cheating its
your daughter knows i see other women
i mean fine its none of my business
struggles to open a bottle of wine she knows im not monogamous
weve discussed it
and thats what
why are you proud of that
your daughter said she likes that about me
takes the wine and opens it with ease
my daughter is confused when it comes to men
i dont blame her
harry hands her the open wine bottle
erica and harry sit not so close together at a long table under a purple sky
another french tune plays
if this wasnt them this would look romantic
othing is said
just two people eating
harry lifts the salt shaker about to add salt to his chicken
should i just call the ambulance now
harry shoots her a look and places the salt shaker back on the table
a starry sky gives the house a storybook setting
we hear the erica works at a laptop at a cluttered table
the clock tells us its a little after one a
annoyed by the ringing phone she points her remote at the cd player and stops the song
harry answers the phone in his room
a moment of quiet
erica points her remote starts the song again starts typing again
now the other line rings
she looks over at the phone watching one red light blink while the other line is answered
what am i doing
she throws a piece of paper over the phone so she cant see it
she clicks on her aol icon and is told aol cannot connect
then worse she smells something
harry is on the phone smoking a cigar
his pajama top is unbuttoned his hair is allover the place
his bed is a mess laptop open newspapers spilling onto the floor
erica stands in the doorway
he quickly hides his cigar
into phone can you hold a see doll
looks to erica hey
okay heres the thing
i really dont want to play the part of the uptight nurse to your bad boy patient
if you want to have another heart attack go ahead its your life but i have work to do and i dont have time to make another run to the
hospital because youre filling your already clogged arteries with smoke but more importantly id rather not have my house smell like a pool hall
erica holds out a partially filled water glass for harry to deposit his cigar in
i have a question for you
she doesnt say anything
do i hhave to say what
have you always been like this or do i bring this out in you
she shakes the water glass waiting for the deposit
he drops the cigar in
i dont think ive ever had this effect on a woman before
picking up the newspapers and what effect do you think youre having on me
i dont quite recognize it thats how i know ive never had it before
erica rolls her eyes as she finishes cleaning up
so you dont sleep
i only need about four hours a night
never slept eight hours in my life
i wish i could
re curtains want me to shut these sun comes in pretty strong in the morning
drawing the drapes who you talking to at this hour
a friend in l
its only ten out there
and thats not past her bedtime
so you dont get more mellow as the hours pass
heading out good night harry
can i ask you one other thing
erica turns whats with the turtlenecks
its the middle of summer
now seriously why do you care what i wear
i like them
ive always liked them
im just a turtleneck kinda gal
you ever get hot
erica is writing her eyes go to the phone with the typing paper over it
she lifts a corner of the paper takes a peek
the one lit line goes out
erica turns off her computer sits for a second
no one has rattled her cage like this in quite some time
and no she doesnt like it
she stands starts to undress
as ericas turtleneck lands on it
then her bra then her pants then her panties
she crosses through the room on her way to the bathroom
she passes by her partially open door happens to look out into seeing it all
and drops out of frame
flustered spins around loses his balance crashes into the wall covers his eyes
oh god am i sorry
what are you doing
trying to find the kitchen
i i got confused
it was dark
i didnt really see anything
just your tits and a little of your erica slams her door
photos on the wall shake
this is gonna be murder
a very wide middle aged nurse gruffly crosses thru the room toward the front door
just as she opens the door erica enters in hat sunglasses turtleneck long skirt
pretty much no skin is showing whatsoever
she carries a few packages
good bye mrs
thats not good
you just started
not fired darlin
just not needed
erica hardly looks at you know who who appears to be fresh out of the shower wet hair silk robe bare chest and legs
what do you mean not needed
of course we need her
shes gonna take care of you and feed you and
no no im actually feeling pretty perky today
making quite a recovery
opening the screen door sorry for the trouble mrs
take care dear
harry hands her a wad of bills like shes a maitred
gimble gives erica a look of pity as she exits
erica now alone with harry self consciously adjusts her sunglasses
harry on the other hand slips his hand onto his bare chest pats it
listen about last night
how bout we never talk about that
hands him some pills i was at the drugstore
your prescriptions were ready
they said take these two with food and this one without
honestly you were in silhouette
i think thats talkin about it
i really didnt see all that much
heading toward her room yip
there you go
wont mention it again but
almost out of the room goin to work harry
yells you saw my ass you dont see me acting nuts wearing hats and glasses and weird get ups
the sound of a door slam
harry and julian sit on the bed
julian takes harrys blood pressure
yes or no
whats the deal can i go
you still getting dizzy
not as much
out of breath
listens with stethoscope hows erica treating you
nods toward living room erica
oh shes a major piece of work
the woman wears turtlenecks in the middle of the summer
shes beyond uptight
almost makes her fun to be around
i havent noticed that
try livin with her
julian takes harrys pulse
with secret glee i actually saw her naked last night
that doesnt sound so uptight
it was an accident
she thought i was asleep i thought her room was the kitchen
you know what freud said there are no accidents
this was an accident
although why would she be walking around naked when she knows im feet away
why would you think her bedroom was the kitchen
it was dark it was two in the morning
that could explain why she was walking around naked
you know ive never seen a woman that age naked before
hey were not all doctors
well i think shes very beautiful and shes a fantastic writer you know
no i dont know
shes pretty major
writing a prescription so you date her daughter
okay now shes a great chick
must take after the father
which reminds me
doc what about mr
indicates his dick when can i be up and running in that department
i think mr
midnight needs to stay put for another couple of weeks
but it wont kill me when i do it right
itll be good for you
and just so you know im told after a heart attack if you can climb a flight of stairs you can have sex
which goes from the beach up to ericas deck
harry stands at the bottom of the stairs in his robe velvet slippers and sunglasses
he looks up to the top of the stairs as if its mt
bravely he climbs the first few steps
after two more hes out of breath
determined he holds onto the railing and drags himself up to the next step
happy with himself he holds on for dear life and drags himself up one more
and then hes so out of breath he can barely move yet he reaches up the railing and tries to hike himself up one more
the tea kettle whistles as erica and julian stand on either side of her island
erica reaches for a tea bag
so youre saying hes not ready to travel at all
not even by plane
i dont think so
sees her disappointment its been tough huh
well he fired the nurse after an hour now says he doesnt need one
hes a bit of a workout
how are you holding up
im fine im
one more fine and i wont believe you
the phone rings
oh shoot hold on
into phone hello
just something about her
not noticing pouring water for her tea
into phone no im finally getting to it
erica sees julian sliding a slip of paper over to her
looks over at it
its a piece of paper from his prescription pad
on it is written
have dinner with me tonight
erica looks up at him
j heading out pick you up around seven
w what about the patient
like he said he doesnt need a nurse
we begin to hear strains of another french song
erica at her desk typing
the music plays from the cd player
as much as she doesnt want it to be true this attention from julian has fueled her
harry dressed for the first time wearing khakis and a summer shirt strolls through the living room a bit cautious
yells warning like im walking around the house
even she knows this is funny
harry arrives at her open doorway timidly pokes his head in
listen ive decided to get over the whole you saw me naked thing
so we dont have to deal with it anymore
good cause ive been hiding from you all day
you want to come in
i dont want to break your rhythm or anything
that would be wishful thinking
harry enters cautiously and curiously
so im gonna venture out there and go for a short walk
you up to that
my doctor recommended it
i gotta build up to stairs and stuff like that
you wouldnt want to join me
that means you dont want me to
no i was asking if you wanted to
oh well i would but
i dont usually like to break once ive started writing so i probably shouldnt not that a little fresh air would hurt but
its just a walk erica not a marriage proposal
you know my name
erica jane barry
i looked you up on the internet
erica and harry walk by the waters edge
they are the only two people on the beach
did you know there are over eight thousand websites that mention you
that cant be possible
no its true
i know everything about you now
and not because of last night but
yeah i understood
i actually looked you up too
you grew up in l
which i thought nobody did
you were the road manager for a group i sorta never heard of started your own record label at sold it at then started buying and selling boutique companies then
invested in a small record company which you turned into the nd largest hip hop label in the world
its exhausting just hearing about it
i know but the truth is it goes fast doesnt it
like the blink of an eye
erica bends down and picks up a flat white stone then another and another
i noticed you have bowls of those all over your house
i know im crazy i just think theyre so beautiful
but why do you only pick up the white ones
i dont only pick up the white ones
oh so you really are crazy
i pick up only the white ones
looks in her hand oh god what does that mean
im controlling unadventurous what
so youre as hard on yourself as you are on everyone else
erica is stunned that he caught on to that
harry bends down picks up a brown stone places it in her palm among the white stones
something to remember me by
erica realizes she cant sum this guy up so easily or at all
so can i ask you something harry
whats with all the young girls
i mean whats the story there really
i just like to travel light
you just like to travel light
oh please what the hell does that mean
now see a thirty year old gets that
you mean falls for that
i mean accepts it
if thats what you want
a non threatening woman who wont get your number you get to run the show
i think our relationship is growing by the way
have you noticed
there he goes again
she cant believe hes cute like this
maybe we just needed to get out of the house
now you may notice interestingly were walking back toward the house and its getting a little rocky again
of course its getting a little rocky were talking about you
see ill accept that slight hostility because im enjoying your company so much
heyre reached the bottom of the beach stairs
harry looks up daunted
yeah but i think i stay down here and watch the sunset
erica checks her watch
big dinner date
well yeah as a matter of fact
with your doctor
ohhhhh my doctor cause hes not too young for you huh
no hes totally too young for me
but were just having dinner
its not a date
does he know that
well ill tell him but i doubt that he thinks of it that way
i doubt that you doubt that
anyway you may like it
think of it this way hes not threatening wont get your number you get to run the show
you might have a hell of a time
over we hear ding dong
and we find julian
looking just as any girl would hope
is harry in his robe and pjs
hey look whos answering the door
and look whos at the door
brought you something
julian hands him a take out food box
a heart healthy dinner from our cafeteria
both guys turn at once
she looks beautiful wearing a dress probably the sexiest one she owns
no turtleneck tonight
julian walks to her kisses her on the cheek
you look beautiful
behind julians back harry gives erica the ok sign
thrown we ready
let me just see how harrys doing
itll take two seconds
har have a seat
sitting self conscious in his new role the sick one
julian takes his wrist feels his pulse
harry looks straight ahead
as she sits right in front of him
she crosses her legs and her dress hikes up a little exposing her thigh
julian furrows his brow
thats not the face you want to see your doctor making
your pulse is a little fast but maybe youre just excited about something
harry looks at ericas legs again
quickly i dont think so
im not excited about anything
erica shifts the hem of her skirt rising even higher
there it goes again
erica rises leaving harrys eye line
oh there we go now i feel better
back to normal
harry winces then rises looks to erica as she throws a pashmina over her shoulders in slow motion
harry rushes them okay all right good have fun dont rush back for me and dont do anything i wouldnt do
well that wouldnt leave us too many options would it
and do we wonder how she writes that snappy repartee
whispers to erica let him pick up the check
itll make him feel older
on ericas shocked expression the door slams
harry lies on the sofa
camera moves up harrys body past the hospital take out carton on his stomach and finally up to his face
as the camera moves we hear hi its marin im not in so leave a message and ill call you back
hey its me
just sitting around looking at your baby pictures
thinking about you
he hangs up dials another number
hi and hi youve reached brooke and shannon
for brooke push one for harry hangs up then slowly sits up letting himself feel as funky as he wants
everybodys out but old har
old old old old har
harry rises dizzily crosses to the bookshelves
he rummages around finds ericas scrapbook pulls it out randomly opens it finds a photo of erica in the s wearing a turtleneck
harry wanders in with the scrapbook tucked under his arm
he notices a bowl filled with white beach stones
harrys brown stone sits at the top of the pile
complimented top of the heap
staring at erica
he cant get enough of her
theyre in a romantic seaside restaurant
and ericas blushing for the first time in twenty five years
so when the land came up i snatched it and the house was built in record time and
blushing to death its like a thousand degrees in here
you know they say doctors fall for people who need rescuing that we have a need to take care of someone
i never heard that one
starts fanning herself with the menu julian how old are you like
okay so im twenty years older than you
more than twenty years older than you
you look fabulous
thank you but you know im not sure where you were headed with that thing you were just saying but in terms of us you just want to be friends
well then what is it that you
want to be
i think id embarrass you if i told you
i was embarrassed just getting dressed to see you
this may surprise you but some women consider me quite the guy
ive never been married
im a doctor
you wouldnt believe what catnip that is for some women
oh yes i would
but you dont like girls your own age
i do very much
but ive never met one ive taken to quite like this and when something happens to you thats never happened to you before dont you have to at least find
out what it is
i suppose but see i dont date all that much or all that well
oh come on you must beat them away with a stick
now youre kidding right
no guys my age the ones ive met
well im not that regular a person and they really like regular
men your age may be really stupid you ever think of that
takes her hand yes i have
looks from her hand to her eyes theres something radically wrong with the idea that no one loves you
right to the middle of her shoulder then her neck
julian kisses her palm then her
i knew youd smell good
how much is soap that smells like this
i dont know
i got it at the market
erica youre incredibly sexy
no swear to god im not
her scrapbook open against his chest
we hear the sound of acar pulling up to the house
harry wakes up
he leaps out of bed this is the fastest hes moved in days
a bit disoriented he straightens the covers looks around for other evidence then hightails it out of there
erica enters letting out a huge sigh
shes brought back to reality when she hears the tv in harrys room
she heads his way then changes her mind and stops
yells im back
you have fun
it was interesting
harrys in bed clearly disappointed that she didnt stop in
erica in pjs and glasses sits at her laptop writing
she hears the chime of someone instant messengering her
it a message from harryl
it says what r u doing
e go back and forth between their two rooms
she answers writing
what r u doing
he writes watching joan rivers sell jewelry
erica laughs when he adds so was your date a date
she types i think so
he types i told ya
then you hungry
surprised she types i just had dinner
he writes yeah but women never eat on dates
to herself how does he know everything
she hesitates then types actually am a little hungry but im in my pjs
he writes me too
she stares at the screen biting her lip
he does the same
erica rises looks in the mirror checks out her boobs in her pajamas
they look so low
she opens a drawer rifles through it takes out a bra takes out a better bra
in his bathroom harry fixes his hair tries to make more of it than he has
erica now wearing a bra under he pajamas checks out her boobs again
she adjusts the straps
lifts them higher
erica and harry enter from opposite sides of the room both in their pajamas
we are cute
this is pretty unusual for me
im not used to having sleepovers
with your social life
my dear you are confusing sex with sleeping
sleeping is something i prefer to do alone
okay good to know
heading for the kitchen so what are you hungry for
joining her what are my choices
i mean i know you think im not very discriminating but
she looks through the fridge
oh god whats the difference what i think
i cant imagine what you think of me
pasta left over coq au vin turkey sandwich or grilled cheese
totally what i wanted
you ever miss being married
i bet you were great at it
sometimes i miss it
but not that much anymore
was one of us just saying something interesting
you said you cant imagine what i think of you
oh right but you dont have to answer that
i mean if you had an opinion id be curious but
will you tell me first why you only miss being married at night
cracking eggs oh cause the phone doesnt ring as much at night and the alone thing happens at night and sleeping by myself took some getting used to
but i got the hang of it
you gotta sleep in the middle of the bed
its absolutely not healthy to have a side when no one has the other side
she starts mixing the batter
okay now im convinced what i think of you is right
you are a tower of strength
shoulders sagging ughhhhhhhhhh
try not to rate my answer
youre like a thoroughbred in a world of mutts
no you know what you are youre like a great portrait over a fireplace
words have been invented to describe women like you
fearful such as
so you think im inhuman
i think youre formidable
but cold and distant
like im frozen in some painting
not at all
i think youre strength defines you
sees how sensitive she is but its thrilling when your defenses are down arid youre not isolated
that i believe is your winning combo
a killer combo actually
so i cant decide if you hate me or if maybe youre the only person who ever got me
i dont hate you
the moment is broken when they hear the front door open and hello
marin arrives in the doorway in a knockout of a dress holding a bag from zabars
she looks fresh vibrant sexy
what are you doing here at this hour
erica and harry have the air of kids caught making out by one of their parents
harry straightens out his pajamas smooths down his hair
erica catches all this
enters kisses erica had this big photography auction tonight then i went out with a bunch of people i checked my messages and got this so sad message from harry
so bored out here
i thought i should come out and at least see how he was doing
kisses harry on the cheek thank you for the gorgeous flowers by the way
they were so huge
erica nods to herself
oh god he sends them all flowers
harry notes ericas reaction
so how are you guys
sets down the zabars bag oh this is too sweet
youre making pancakes
and youre both in your pjs
now i feel im interrupting
dont be silly
you know i never sleep and this one doesnt sleep either
whats in the bag
reaches into the bag a quart of matzoh ball soup for harry
i know its not the remedy for heart problems but it is low cholesterol
hating to correct her but high sodium
for mom your favorite raisin bread
and for me
reaches into the bag my favorite vodka
marins cell phone rings
into phone hello
no im here babe
made record time
everyones still there
erica feeling suddenly frumpy fixes her hair
harry watches her
she catches him and shrugs
marin flips her phone shut and tosses it in her purse
so mar now that youre here why dont you finish the pancakes and ill get back to work
i just got here hold on
she pours a healthy vodka into a glass grabs some ice
so your ex husband stood me up today
we were supposed to have lunch at barneys
he never showed up
was he always like this
honey i dont know
this is what happens after a couple gets divorced the kid inherits all the problems
not that im a kid
then to harry the flirt in her coming back so how are you how do you feel
when can you go home
just as harry is about to answer marins cell rings
she picks it up looks at her caller id throws it back in her bag
i really am gonna do a little work
you two catch up
and just flip these hin like two seconds
you dont want pancakes anymore
i uh i dont think i
looks at marin so gorgeous next to him no
marin watches her mother exit then looks to harry his eyes following her mom out the door
shes sees a look on harrys face she never remotely saw when he looked at her
at first shes shocked
he likes my mother
then a flash of jealousy
he likes my mother
then pure joy realizing how perfect it is
erica back in a turtleneck picks peaches out of a basket
marin enters her frame baseball cap sunglasses picking cherries
im breaking up with harry
what do you mean
cause i met someone else
in the two days youve been gone
you know me my lifes crazy
i meet a thousand people everyday
also lets face it the guys insanely old for me
id be nuts to keep this going
true but you know he is
hes soulful when you dont expect it right
now mom if you could handle this i was thinking
you and harry
i cant handle it
wouldnt want to handle it
but youre only saying that cause you think he and i have had sex
lower your voice
whispering never even got close
swear to god
erica digests this just puttin that out there
cause for two people who are convinced they got life beat theres was somethin cooking in the kitchen last night other than pancakes
erica looks out her kitchen window and sees marin and harry talking on the beach
she leans so far to see them shes about to lose her balance
the phone rings she reaches for it and slips right out of frame
into phone hello
julian in his scrubs walks quickly down a hallway of the er on his cell phone
ive waited a reasonable amount of hours before calling you even though youve been on my mind since i woke up at
im wondering when we could have dinner again
i have to work the next few nights and if we wait til next week i know youll chicken out so hows friday
i know its like a date night but i think thats good
who is this
julian stops short
can you meet me at the grill at eight
thats seems fine
i look forward to seeing you too
erica smiles to herself
turning off the phone and grabbing his heart marin enters through the kitchen door looking almost a little dazed
okay hes all yours
howd he take it
he just took care of it for me he was an ace
said our fate was to be friends
oh my god
realizes something he was breaking up with me
hes a genius
thats impossible he wouldnt
it doesnt matter were done and we both feel good about it
hugs her i gotta get back
as she exits now erica try to think of this as the smartest thing youve ever done for yourself
marin exits and the phone rings
into the phone hello
from the beach thought youd like to know your daughter broke up with me
harry and erica talk while looking at each other through the kitchen window
made up a story about meeting another guy
guess i wasnt so cute with an iv in my arm
no i think she really did meet someone else
hey its alright
her mother didnt like me anyway
smiles how bout i bring you out some lunch and a couple of blood pressure pills
youre a great woman erica
erica relaxes is this why my doctor is falling in love with you
erica and harry sit on a blanket on a cloudy day having a picnic lunch
harry is telling erica a story and she screams with laughter
erica picks them up as
she walks with harry by the waters edge
they talk non stop
out of nowhere a downpour
erica and harry gather their picnic things
the blanket starts to fly and harry grabs it as erica runs after a plate spinning away in the wind
erica and harry wet from the rain quickly shut all the doors and windows
lightning crackles across the sky and the and a candle is lit
then another one and another one
erica turns and finds harry just looking at her
before either of them has time to think they kiss
truly confused for what
i just kissed you
no honey i kissed you
relieyed erica kisses him
i know that one was me
try not to keep score
he kisses her again and again
im so glad they still work
i havent used them for kissing in so long
theyve been more like for wearing lipstick and whistling and
he kisses her quiet
relieved she finally fully kisses him back
a big gorgeo s kiss
well well now look whos got something that works
they both look down at harry
and you didnt even take via puts his finger on her lips kiss me before you make it go away
he kisses him long and sweet
theyre kissing on it
the rain pelts against the windows as the sun goes down
this could be world class interesting
erica nods having any doubts
as they kiss yes
but so far the kissing is spectacular
he looks at her im not grading you just mentioning it
he tries to kiss her neck but the turtleneck is in the way
he pulls it down but its tight and its difficult to get to her
cant get past your damn turtleneck
he tries lifting the shirt from the bottom its awkward he doesnt want to be down there yet
he comes back up when erica reaches to her night table slides opens the drawer takes out a scissors and hands it to him
breathless cut it off
what a brilliant invitation
he takes the scissors and starts cutting from the bottom right past her belly up her torso between her breasts
the turtleneck falls open from the center
when he reaches her neck he gently tears at it and it easily rips apart and there she is
he takes her in
she shakes her head no
shuts her eyes
open your eyes so i know you can hear me
she opens her eyes beautiful
they kiss and she reaches down for his pants
what about birth control
thrilled whos the lucky boy
he kisses between her breasts her stomach heads down and out of frame
erica cant quite believe life held this twist for her
then i think we should take your blood pressure
his head pops back into frame
its irresponsible not to
sprawled out on the bed
erica straddles him and whips the blood pressure cuff on his arm and pumps it hard
like a warm jewish mother of a dominatrix
he looks up at her shaking his head
nobody but you would
so youre lucky
erica grabs harrys glasses reads the results
ecstatic one twenty over eighty
hurdles recklessly into the air
the rain is coming down in torrents
we are close on ericas face upside down hanging off the side of the bed
shes sweaty flushed overwhelmed
oh my god i do like sex
camera twirls around and we find harry sprawled nearby catching his breath satisfied stunned scared
you certainly do
erica arrives next to him also out of breath
so this is what youre supposed to do on a rainy afternoon
hes trying to be his debonair self but somethings off
hes very aware of himself
they lie there quietly for a second when erica begins to tear up
harry slowly nervously turns to her
i really thought i was sorta closed for business
just never expected this
nods nothins ever surprised me more
flattered erica snuggles up close
harry puts his arm around her
then with no warning his eyes fill with tears
this is crazy
i cant remember the last time i cried
i think im overwhelmed
crying with him me too
thats the perfect word
baby i had sex three days after a heart attack and i didnt die
that kind of overwhelmed
thats gotta be some kind of record
good sport erica gives him a double thumbs up
wiping her tears lets not brag about this to our doctor okay
honey i may not be many things but one thing i am is a gentleman
harry holds her close
erica erica erica
she turns to him you know im not good at being monogamous right
please i hardly know you
he looks at her wondering if shes for real
she smiles as she wipes a small tear from the corner of her eye
then he kisses her
candles light the room
its still raining
so there i was at nineteen in new york by myself and id never seen snow before and i didnt have enough money for the bus so i had to
had no idea how far it was and im talking blizzard and im in sneakers
in ericas room making out
a cell phone rings
they both look around for it
erica reaches for it on her desk
turns phone upside down hello

the news said the winds are like a zillion miles an hour
oh no were fine

yes and thank you for the wonderful opportunity
erica flips the phone shut looks to harry embarassed
to harry am i interested in buying aluminum siding
marins selling aluminum siding
erica buries her face in his chest
harry and erica sit on stools at the kitchen island drinking wine and eating scrambled eggs right out of the pan
candles light the room
but why paris
i just always wanted to write a play that ended there
people need romance like that
and if someone like me doesnt write it where they gonna get it
slightly insulted excuse me
what do you call this
eating eggs by candlelight in our robes after
she kisses him starts to say im sorry when he pulls her back kisses her again then looks at her hard perplexed
so where do you like to eat in paris
e oh i love this place called le balzar its just a little bistro on the left bank best roast chicken in the universe
youd be fun to go to paris with
its a great city to stay up all night in
then whens your birthday
mines in january
so how bout if we still know each other by then we go to paris for our birthdays
a beat then maybe
sees the look on his face
i have no idea how to do this
be intimate but not
the color is draining from your face
okay look im gonna pee take one of your blood pressure pills then when i get back lets not talk anymore
she gets out of bed
youre the funniest girl i ever had sex with
she has no idea how to take that
decides to accept it
she turns sees hes getting out of bed approaching her
i think im gonna go back to my room
let you sleep
let me sleep
you usually send the girls home
but i am home
im an old dog you know
hey its perfectly
this was a great night
at one point i even thought soul mates you know
stares straight up at the ceiling
erica gets back in her bed
she lies there for a second securing her armor back in place
she routinely moves to the middle of the bed neatens out the covers and shuts her eyes
then a small knock on her open door
she sees harry in the doorway
id like to try sleeping with you
erica hesitates then moves to one side of the bed and as harry climbs in next to her we the place is a mess the aftermath of the storm
arry spoons with erica on her side of the bed his arms snuggly around her
the electricity pops bagk on and the room is suddenly lit up and one of ericas french cds comes on full blast
harry opens his eyes
hes surprised to see he has his arm around her
erica awakens just as surprised
in the light of day a definite hint of embarrassment
grabs his watch blinks can you see this
not really but it looks like it says eleven
slips on his glasses it is eleven
it cant be that would mean we slept eight hours
they turn and finally look at each other
both look wrinkled messy haired a little wiped
how ya doin ace
she elts as he lies right back down whoa nelly
okay just stay still heres the clicker
you know you have a doctors appointmqnt in an hour
getting out of bed
ill make us some coffee get you your pills whip us up some french toast i have the best maple syrup ever
she turns you are a woman to love
erica smiles then walks away with the achey walk of a woman who hasnt had sex in many a year but has more than made up for it in the
she holds onto the wall as she exits the room a little bow legged like shes just gotten off a horse
alone in the hallway she stops
you are woman to love
what the hell does that mean
spits out a long tape
tilt up to julian at the end of the tape
harry sits on an examining table in julians office buttoning up his shirt
okay buddy im sending you home
these past few days have done wonders for you
yeah ive been working on that stair thing
i can do it by the way
quickly climb a flight of stairs
several times actually
harry stands tucks in his shirt smiling proudly to himself
way to go
i know you must know her name by now
yes i do
erica as it turns out is an amazing woman
does whatever she can to make me happy
turns out shes very giving
julian suddenly riveted to these words
looking away yeah well thats wonderful
i think shes wonderful
a real moment between them
julian decides to take the high road
i think shes wonderful too
gathering his things give her my best
thanks for everything
julian shakes harrys hand
harrys eyes tear up
youre gonna be okay
touching his tears what the
this is the second time ive done this now
i get overcome or something
its very common to become emotional after having an episode like youve had
everything takes on a new meaning
wiping his tears so its not crazy for a man to do something entirely out of character after having a heart attack
handing him kleenex like crying
yeah and totally changing their tastes
like suddenly really liking something they never thought they could like
and im talking really liking it
i think you can expect just about anything right now
people have done some wild things after having a heart attack
selling businesses getting divorced moving
some people say it saved their lives
but most people go back to being themselves right
ill go back to being me wont i
she wears a blouse with more buttons unbuttoned than ever in her life
she picks up the phone
on his cell hi
whatd he say
he said youre wonderful
no really whatd he say
how are you
he said im good
that i can go
obviously conflicted oh
yeah he said
by tomorrow for absolute sure
you think you can deal with me for one more night
packed with young people
in the middle of this twentysomething sun burnt beach crowd we find erica and harry the two coolest people in the room dancing with each other
harry leads erica through a crowd listening to a girl singing britney spears oops i did it again
when she finishes the crowd enthusiastically applauds
big breath okay here goes
here goes what
here goes me singing to you
pulling a disc out of his pocket bought my own music
you knew they had karaoke
baby its why were here
harry makes his way to the stage hands them his disc
hes handed a microphone
he looks right at erica
this is for you ace
then under his breath wish me luck
the music begins and it is an instrumental version of one of ericas french songs i wish you love
sings i wish you bluebirds in the spring
to give your heart a song to sing
and then a kiss but more than this
i wish h you love
arry takes out a sheet of paper and his glasses
dont want to blow this part
now harry sings the rest of the song in french
sings et en juillet une limonade
pour vous refroidir dans quelque lefy glade
and so on
erica watches knowing something in her life has just that second forever changed
and as harry continues singing we packing the trunk of the town car in front of ericas house
harry tosses his pills in a leather bag
erica enters doing the worst job shes ever done of being strong
holding some cigars here you go you can have these back now
harry looks confused i confiscated them your first night here
smells them thank you darlin
try not to smoke them
hands him a small bag and i packed you a sandwich just in case your blood sugar got low
and some of that iced tea you like and a nonfat low cholesterol cookie
and a peach
what a doll
notices got something else
from behind her back erica pulls out a mason jar filled with all dark beach stones with one white stone in the center
something to remember me by
harry hugs her
erica awkwardly throws her arms around him and kisses him then kisses him better
hes moved by her
there is that
and hey well always have paris
honey no words can ever express my gratitude for taking me in and taking care of me and
hey your heart attack could be the best thing that ever happened to me
kisses her quickly even faster throws out i love ya
i love you too
if thats what you said
i dont know if it ends in ya if its an official i love you but
harry expression looks something like hes in pain
youre not like anybody
neither are you
lowell drives rattling on about all the people who have been calling about him
harry in the backseat looks back at the house until it is finally out of view
harry then looks inside the bag with the sandwich and finds an envelope from erica pulls it out doesnt open it places it back in the bag then takes out
his cell phone and dials
the room is empty
erica rushes in picks up the phone
i knew youd call
on her cell phone crying
i had breakfast with dad this morning and were talking and he starts looking all weir and then he tells me he met someone three weeks ago and its really
something and then he sobbing now he tells me hes getting married
why am i reacting this way
im almost thirty years old
people stare at her yes im crying leave me alone
whos he marrying
i dont know
some chick he met three weeks ago
shes four years older than me and shes an ear nose and throat doctor
has he lost his mind

why do i have to be the one to deal with this
can you please come in
im rea y upset my shrink away for two weeks
i know youre working but
one of those gorgeous tree lined streets from a woody allen movie that makes new york seem quaint
harrys town car pulls up in front of a gorgeous pristine townhouse
harry steps out in shades holding an unlit cigar
lowell joins him as the front door opens and out pours his two leggy assistants and thumping hip hop music
lowell good to be back
harry lets find out
camera quickly tracks erica down the front path and to her car
shes on her cell
hold on im losing you
okay so youll let harry know ill be
in the city tonight and he can reach me on my cell
if he wants
a crowd files in for tonights auction
a tearful marin is changing from jeans and a t shirt to a proper dress and heels
erica leans on a table listening
look i get that he has a right to get remarried but he doesnt even know her and shes like my age
you know what thats like
its like beyond creepy
and i know hes not replacing me so why does it feel like he is
this is crazy right
crying like this
lights a cigarette honey if hes replacing anyone its me
and all the statistics say divorced men almost always remarry
thats just the way theyre built
slipping on her dress mom you want to know the answer to the big mystery of my life
why im always with the wrong guy
this is why
because the wrong guy cant do this to you
you have some control with the wrong guy
this thing im feeling right now
this is my big fear
that some guy could get me unglued like this like nothings connected
and this is just my father
im just not strong enough to handle this kind of drama
the drama in life is what makes you strong
no its what makes you strong
youve never really understood this but were not all like you
im sorry if i were you and my ex husband the man who i still allow to direct my plays
was getting married to some year old ear nose and throat babe id be bonkers
and look at you
realizes youve never looked better by the way
sinks my anti depressant is obviously not working
it should cover events like this shouldnt it
since when do you take an antidepressant
ugggh mother do you know anyone who doesnt
i rest my case
a knock on the door
marin were all set
mom can you do one other really big thing for me
just say yes

he wants me to meet her and i can not go alone
i already asked him if you could come and he said it was fine and she said it was fine
look youre gonna have to meet her too so we might as well meet her together
come on you know you can handle it
erica pauses thinks m about it
she knows she can too
see that look on your face
thats the gene i didnt get
marin now all pulled together stands at the podium in front of a packed house
if you didnt know youd never guess
good evening and welcome to sothebys and this evenings sale of impressionistic and modern art
bidders should know that the auctioneer may open bidding on any lot below the reserve by placing a bid on behalf of the seller
lets start with lot i the bonnard drawing
starting with my bidders is bid is mine gentlemans bid is here on the phone
in the back of the room watching with pride and worry
she slips out her cell checks her messages
her phone lights up and tells her she has voice mail
we are in ericas empty kitchen in the hamptons and her phone is ringing
as a mans hand turns it off
we are julian sits at a table by himself in a coat and tie tucking away his phone
the waiter sympathetically approaches the table
guess i got stood up
would you like to order or
why not i put
on the tie and everything
and can you bring me another
indicating his drink julian takes a look at the menu then looks away
and as the camera widens we realize we are camera takes us to erica marin dave and daves fiance kristen a combo of a hot tie and a young professional
everyone has menus and drinks
a waiter delivers two new martinis for marin and erica
they both go right for them
erica drinks too much too fast
d to erica thirsty
ive had a big week dave forgot how these slip right down
so kristen whered you go to
burps medical school

marin takes out a pack of cigarettes

i mean for a totally surreal situation like this

peruses menu erica do i like duck
its rabbit you hate

lets let her figure some things out on her own
i didnt mean those things dave
she did go to medical school
pointing to herself and kristen hey not in front of the kids
polishing off her martini i will tell you this
dave has one truly great love in his life
okay i forgot to mention she cant drink hard liquor
to marin why did you order her a martini
its not true
the man can not watch tv or read without the hand down the pants heres my advice after years i say who cares theyre his balls let him enjoy em
chokes i think i swallowed my olive whole
erica looks up and sees something that takes her breath away
and headed in her direction
a sexy young thing followed by her date no other than harry
harry stops to shake someones hand holds his date around the waist
suddenly the sound drops out of the restaurant as harry and his date walk right by ericas table in slow motion not noticing her
as the room comes alive again
her eyes follow harry as he is seated only one table away his back to erica his date facing her
marin hasnt seen him
erica tries her hardest to act normal but apparently isnt
mom you okay
erica looks at her menu then her eyes go right back to harry
his date is laughing at something harry is saying
harry leans in to her whispers something to her
she touches his hand
you know what
maybe i need a little air
erica rises grabs her purse almost bumps into a waiter as she passes harrys table knocks into someones chair a glass breaks
everyone turns to her including harry
she now stands right at his table
he smiles up at her
to his date hello
erica rushes out
shes a little high and her heart is pounding
she heads down the street
oh god im so stupid
she picks up her pace starts running
her cell phone rings
intercut harry and erica on their cells a block apart
walking quickly slow down
you want to kill me
she considers it
harry i gotta go
erica shes just a friend
yeah she looks like a buddy kind of a girl
erica reaches a corner cant get across turns the corner
harry arrives next to her
come on its just a dinner
look harry heres the problem
i really like you
i really like you
yeah but i love you like you
that stops him i do
i love you
harry swoons and not in a good way
i think maybe you should consider that youre in love with the idea of being in love
stomps her feet im like the dumb girl who doesnt get it
tries not to cry in front of him ive never been the dumb girl before
it aint so great
lets just calm down
this was just a a meal with a friend
did you know i called you seven hours ago
i was gonna call you
ive been jamming all day its my first day back
i had these plans before i met you
but i do like seeing you
im always surprised by it
what was i thinking
maybe you werent thinking for once and look what a good time we had
lets not ruin something great
harry i wont be good at this
acting like i dont care
i have never lied to you
i have always told you some version of the truth
freaking on that one the truth doesnt have versions
can you cut me a little slack
my lifes been turned upside down
then lets each get our bearings
i dont want my bearings
ive had my bearings my whole fucking life
i felt something with you that
oh you dont want to yes i do
she wont open up tell me
i felt something with you i didnt know really existed
you know what thats like after a twenty year marriage
to feel something for another person thats so off the charts that harry looks down okay not your problem
this is why im not good in relationships
you know writers are like teachers those who can do those who cant write romantic comedies where this does not happen in the third act
and it certainly does not happen to a year old woman
in the play ill be so it wont be as pathetic
im just too old to feel crushed
ive written this feeling but i never really got it
realizes you know what this is
pointing to herself this is heart broken
hows that for impervious
youre killin me
i just wish it had lasted more than a week
thats a horrible thing to say
walks off comes back the life i had before i met you
i knew how to do that could do that forever
now look at me
what do i do with all this
can we talk tomorrow
i saw your friend you were having dinner with if thats what you want its never going to work with me
look at me
im a middle aged woman dont let this brown hair fool you i dont have a real brown hair on my head im almost all grey
that would freak you out wouldnt it
and i have
high cholesterol and my back hurts every morning and im post menopausal and i have osteoperosis and im sure arthritis is just around the corner and i know youve seen
my vericose veins
lets face it man thats not quite the buzz youre lookin for
a taxi pulls up
and you know what
everyday im gettin older
just like you
erica opens the back door of the taxi
this is his chance
the truth is
i dont know how to be a boyfriend
thats what you have to say after all this
you dont know how to be a boyfriend
thats not a small thing
theyre both out of words
are we done
i dont know
he doesnt give
she ducks into the cab and it pulls away
harry stands on the street watching her go
he grabs his heart
wheeled through the emergency room of beth israel hospital
this is not the hamptons
this place is crawling with patients
harrys delivered to a latina doctor in her thirties dr
as hes taken off the gurney hes immediately hooked up to a heart monitor given oxygen and an came in by cab minutes of chest pain no nauseau some shortness
of breath was hospitalized a week ago with a coronary thrombosis
hang a nitro drip
i took viagra
you have been through this before
give him mgs of metoprolol
you h ving chest pain right now
no and the pain i was having was sharp not like before
not like before is we like to hear
reads ekg give him aspirin
based on what i see so far your heart is not in distress but im gonna do a rapid enzyme test to be sure
what were you doing at the onset of the pain
having a fight with someone
can a woman give you chest pain
are you kidding
love hurts havent you heard
yeah but so far ive only given pain i never got any
confused at how literal he is all right well youre battin a thousand here
your enzymes look perfect your ekg is normal and the pain doesnt sound like the kind of pain we worry about
i think what you experienced was normal chest pain associated with stress
and incase you havent heard that can give you a heart attack
langer i donlt know what youre up to gallivanting out and about at this hour but if you were my dad id make sure you were home in bed recuperating
harry slowly climbs up the gorgeous staircase of his townhouse
exhausted he stops half way up sits on a step takes out his cell
if you were my dad
he pulls his glasses out of his pocket puts them on to dial
something feels odd he takes off his glasses looks at them theyre not his theyre ericas
he puts them back on and dials
im not here so leave a message
he realizes he doesnt know what to say hangs up then looks at her glasses
grabbing his chest ouch
a light pops on and erica enters her bedroom crying
she flops down on her bed picks up her phone grabs her glasses puts them on doesnt realize theyre harrys
voice mail tells her she has one message
she sits up excited
j erica hi its julian
its about im in the restaurant
just wondering if youre
erica hangs up starts crying again
she takes off her glasses to wipe her eyes when she realizes shes holding harrys glasses
just the sight of them makes her burst into tears the kind of tears that have been thirty years in the making
a tear lands on it
erica back in a turtleneck and wearing harrys glasses starts writing at a breakneck pace all the while tears flood her eyes
as soon as her eyes open she bursts into tears
while in the shower the crying never stops
while she eats breakfast a downpour
running on the beach shes wailing
back at the computer shes sobbing as her hands fly over the keys
an actual boo hoo can be heard
at night laptop in bed erica writes eating a bagel wearing harrys glasses and a pair of wrinkled pajamas french music plays in the bg
at this point she doesnt even pay attention to her tears just wipes and types when out of nowhere she receives an instant message from harry
he writes do i hear french music
shocked she sits up tries to fix her hair
harry sits up in bed staring at his laptop wearing ericas glasses a pair of pajamas and a three day growth
a thermometer is propped in his mouth
he writes r u there
she answers yes
he writes how are ya
she writes great
as she wipes her tears on her sleeve
e writes hows the writing going
she answers pouring out of me now
he types i miss y
he stops thinks before sending
rica waits on her side
nothing is coming over
then on his side he receives actually just running out
harry deletes the i miss y
and instead writes u
erica slides down in her bed wiped
harry takes out his thermometer
looks at the clock
lowell lies in bed in pjs watching tv smoking
harry arrives at his doorway in his pajamas
lowell puts out his cigarette fans the smoke
lowell im goin out
dont forget to put some clothes on
i mean i should go out shouldnt i
when dont i go out
just cause some emergency room doctor tells me to stay in bed doesnt mean i have to turn into a monk
is there something youd like me to do for you mr
well no just
well what are you doin
would you hate making me something to eat
lying on top of the covers in lowells room both eating bowls of pasta watching tv
funny women are adorable dont you think
i never really thought about it
neither had i but think about it
funnys a unique thing in a woman
its fun to be around
theres some reason weve been watching these two for o years
were not sittin here watchin mamie van doren reruns
no were not
you feeling okay
i dont think ive slept one night since ive been home
every little ache and pain scares the shitout of me
cant get a handle on my emotional life dont know what i want dont know if what i felt was because i just had a heart attack or was real
plus i feel needy
i never used that word in my life
lowell have you ever seen me like this
nothing even close
thats right buddy im a mess
and im no good at it
realizes something those are very nice pajamas by the way
did they used to be mine
yes but you gave them to me you said you never wore them
but why would i do that
theyre so elegant
langer youre always giving away beautiful things
how did i get like this
eyes fluttering shut im gonna shut my eyes for a few minutes
keep lucy on
harry nods off and lowell turns out the light
erica and zoe are taking a walk
erica still crying picks up a brown stone explains its meaning to zoe
zoe holds the stone makes an awwww face
erica nods then zoe tosses the stone in the ocean fed up with hearing about him already
then zoe stops erica points to something
frolicking on the beach
hes a young hunk in a tank top shorts highlighted hair
erica rolls her eyes
marin rushes down the stairs
erica sits near the bottom of the stairs watching the sunset
mom were going into town
erica turns wiping tears
are you crying
joining her i didnt know you did that
yeah its my new thing
ive gotten abnormally great at it
sitting on the step with her is it harry
seems i gotta learn how to do that love em and leave em stuff
you dont care when i say fuck do you
not right now
so now you get my theory about love
you gotta self protect
its too dangerous
marin that theory
how can i put this so your feelings wont get hurt
its just so crazy it makes me want to screammmmmmmmmmm
and how would you put it if you wanted to hurt my feelings
listen to me
you cannot hide from love for the rest of your life because maybe it wont work out and maybe youll become unglued
thats not a way to live
so youre telling me youre happy right now
this is good what happened to you
this was bad
but for the three days it was good it was electrifying
marins eyes fill up
i think you must consider the possibility that we are more alike than you realize
i let someone in and i had the time of my life
tearful ive never had the time of my life
and bubbee i say this from the deepest part of my heart
what the fuck are you waiting for
a party is in progress
the place is crawling with characters from the hip hop world
harry winds his way down his crowded staircase girls grabbing at him as he passes by
as hard as he tries he cant quite bring to life the guy he knew how to be
as harry passes aving fun
harry makes his way down the stairs through the crowded entry and out the front door
outside harry steps into the quiet street looks up at his house and the party inside
zoe is picking corn when she notices julian across the way
he glances up looks right past her obviously doesnt remember her keeps on shopping
zoe thinks for a see wondering how she can get his attention when he looks right back at her his face full of hope
erica sets the table for two
zoe pokes her head in the door
i got you something great at the farm stand
zoe fully opens the door revealing julian holding a bouquet of fresh cut flowers
these are for you to give me when you apologize
zoe erica and julian share a bottle of wine and a home cooked meal
the camera does a around the table their faces saying it all
the women bask in julians warmth as he entertains them with stories
zoe looks from julian to erica relieved to see her sister smiling again
erica places coffee cups in the sink
julian is next to her leaning against the counter holding a glass of wine
julian i hope you know im mortified by my behavior
i was going to get in touch with you send you a note or something
thats a little chilly
i just havent been myself lately
what can i say
just tell me youre sorry
i am sorry
then you could kiss me
youll forgive me if i kiss you
erica hesitates then gives him a peck of a kiss
no one on earth would forgive you for that kiss places his wine glass on the counter may i
erica nods as julian takes her in his arms and gives her a kiss that doesnt quit
still holding her whispers i forgive you
erica very distinctly begins to hear the beating of her own heart
on it is written the lights on the eiffel tower dim to black as the music continues to play
erica sits back still wearing harrys glasses
finished at last
she notices an empty kleenex box on her desk
she tosses it in a hook shot across the room and it lands right in the trash can
julian sits on the sofa shoes off reading the first half of the play
a fire burns in the fireplace
erica approaches the back of the sofa holding the rest of the pages
its the best thing youve ever written
erica leans oyer the sofa reading over his shoulder
how great is it that im not intimidated by your brilliance
erica gives him a small kiss of appreciation
must we go through this every time
she leans into him and he kisses her fully and sweetly
she holds onto the sofa for support
eating lunch in orsos talking non stop
im totally excited about this audition
its such a great part
its supporting but shes a really funny character
theres this totally hilarious scene where shes dating this like chauvinist older guy and just as theyre about to do it the guy moans and she thinks hes just really
into her right
except hes having a heart attack and shes like creeped out and her mother who basically despises the guy rushes in gives him cpr and saves his life
choking on his lunch
auditions are in progress
on stage an actress reads for the part of the sister
look were four sophisticated people
why cant we all stay for the weekend
in the audience
she sits in a row by herself listening
harry enters her frame sitting directly behind her
i need to talk to you
erica freezes horrified
turns sees him
got a minute
erica and harry stand in front of a backdrop of the beach
so your plays about us
no its about me
am i in it
a guy like you is in it but hes not you
what happens to this guy whos not me
havent totally decided
he can live or he can die
what are you leaning towards
harry reacts its funnier
he dies of a funny heart attack
hes sort of a schmuck who screwed around with our heroine so it wont be too sad
schmucks are people too you know
death doesnt seem a little harsh
i just went where the story took me
its a work of fiction harry
just stuff i made up
approaching erica were ready to do the hospital do you take viagra scene
should we wait for you
erica nods horrified
so im going to be the laughing stock of broadway
harry hes not you
hes a version of the truth of you
so to speak
sorry to interrupt again but dave wants to know when henry says i love ya you want that to be ya not you right
we now hear louis armstrongs la vie en rose play throughout the theater
the beach backing is raised and an eiffel tower backing is lowered behind them
they both try to ignore the music but its impossible
well you look really nice
you feeling all right
as they stand in front of the eiffel tower backing fake snow falls from above
you know it isnt like i wanted to stop seeing you
we couldve carried on a fun thing for awhile
why is it you dames want all or nothing
i dont know were just goofy when it comes to love
look harry if its all right with you id like to be friends im not ready to be your friend
anyway do you actually buy that horse shit
that men and women can be friends once theyve had sex
im friends with my ex husband but then again we didnt just have sex
we didnt just have sex either
then what was it
love to know
can i e mail it to you when i figure it out
laughs this is perfect
i have given the cant we be friends speech for years
i think i invented the cant we be friends speech
but you know what now i get why they never went for it
you dames got one thing right
sometimes sex does change everything
call me crazy but i just dont see us out on the town being pals having dinner cause id bet you anything at some point one of us will have
very unfriend like thoughts about the other then pass the bread becomes anything but pass the bread
you get what im saying
you dont want to be friends
cant be friends
doesnt work that way
tries to calm down okay im moving into another phase of this thing
im mad at you
realizes it almost feels good
i think im mad at you too
cause i dont like thinking about you so much and worrying about how you are and if i ruined your life or
youve worried about me
yes honey the schmuck who deserves to die worries about you
harry contd sometimes worrying about you feels like a full time job
well doll im doing fine
so you dont have to work that shift anymore
again the stage manager
erica they want you to take a look at the costumes for the dancing henrys
these gonna work for you
harry and erica turn and see a chorus line of balding year harry flies out the stage door right into the street is almost hit by a motorcycle doesnt seem
harry walks briskly through the park still pissed his pace starting to get to him
he spots a bench with a woman jogger at one end
he parks himself at the other end of the bench out of breath
tries h reason with himself
to god is a woman i know that now
no man would punish me like this
you never change do you
surprised harry turns glances over at the woman
she drinks from a water bottle then offers him an easy warm smile
shes adorable mid sixties short grey hair
do you know me or are you just talking to me as man in general the beast women love to hate
no no i know you harry
dont tell me
i dated your daughter
the woman laughs right
i broke her heart then she married some hard working joe on the rebound has three great kids
what is so funny
you dated me and you broke my heart but after you i met the right guy
ive been married thirty seven years have four kids eight grandkids and a ninth on the way
harry now fully turns in her direction totally clueless
i dated you
the woman nods did we
we did not
he looks at her hard but still doesnt remember her
can you give me hint
harry squints at her you took me to shea stadium
to a mets game
i mustve really liked you
you took me to see the beatles
oh god i really liked you
we saw the beatles together
how the hell have you been
what happened to you
well lets see after we stopped going out i went back to school got my doctorate in marine biology went around the world a few times met the man of
my dreams at oxford married him we lived in london for years
i wrote and taught we raised sons and a daughter
ive just finished my ninth book and now im training for my first marathon
now i must confess i actually remember the very last thing you ever said to me
sandra contd you walked me to my door i was tearful and you looked at me with those puppy dog eyes and said honey i just dont know how to
be a boyfriend
now tell me what have you been up to since
over harrys face we hear the sound of a siren blaring
harry is wheeled through the er with the gurney
martinez runs along with the gurney
back so soon
this is it im dyin ive had minutes of severe chest pain nausea shortness of breath blood pressures gotta be over
sticks out his arm give me the nitrate i didnt take viagra
rips open his shirt plug me in to the ekg i need an aspirin im taking beta blockers blood thinner lipitor procardia and if i were you id be pounding
youre a doctor huh
just a very sick man
martinez reads it
langer your diagnosis although fascinating was entirely incorrect
your realize a severe anxiety attack can masquerade as a heart attack
so im nuts
the one thing im not taking pills for
if you dont want to end up in here every week i suggest you do whatever it takes to decompress
try something with me okay
takes his pulse close your eyes
now give yourself a visual image of something that gives you a feeling of peace and serenity
i dont know
clear blue water
we hear the sound of lapping water sea gulls
anybody there with you
what else do you see feel taste
a cuban cigar
miles of soft beach
youre doing great
and as harry keeps listing things camera moves in on him as the steel band gets louder and louder
boom down to see the theater marquee of ericas play on broadway
on the marquee are raves from critics and a banner that brags sold out
amera continues down to street level
couples walk by bundled up against the cold
harry enters frame
he looks different
he has a beard and has lost some weight and in his eyes a calm we havent seen before
he pauses in front of the theater loo s at the publicity photos
he sees henry in his boxer shorts at the refrigerator meeting emily and her sister
he sees another photo of the dancing henrys kicking up their legs like rockettes
then finally a photo of henry and emily in bed both wearing glasses
harry opens the door to the theater steps inside and listens hearing louis armstrongs la vie en rose then the audience breaks out in laughter
harry smiles to himself
the elevator opens
harry steps out looks around for an apartment number finds it rings the bell and clears his throat
the door quickly opens and we see marin
she looks relaxed and happy to see him
i couldnt believe you were calling from downstairs
hugs him so great to see you
you couldnt look better
come on in
no no i just wanted to stop by and say hi and tell you im sorry if i ever did anything to you that wasnt on the up and up
what do you mean
you were great to me
well i dont know what youve done to yourself but you look absolutely radiant
im three months pregnant that might have something to do with it
the lucky guy
my husband hold on he really wants to meet you
a solid citizen of a guy joins marin loosened tie glasses
harry langer my husband danny yellin
shaking harrys hand ive heard so much about you
yeah with hthe play and all
im famous huh
just to us
in every interview my mom does she always says she made you up
so the guy in the play he doesnt make it does he
he basically dies at the end of the second act but its very funny
as if thats some consolation was hopin shed give me a reprieve but
best of luck kids
marin is stumped by this little visit
harry heads toward the elevator pushes the button then turns back
how is she
harry waits really good
up to her old tricks
learning italian remodeling her apartment in the city
now if i wanted to see her
how would that go over
encouragingly only one way to find out except shes out of town right now
where is she
she left two days ago for her birthday
but shell be back next week
the elevator arrives
harry salutes his goodbye and steps inside the elevator
he turns faces camera
and a clean shaven dapper looking harry steps off cashmere coat gorgeous scarf
camera follows him out of the elevator and through a beautiful lobby of a hotel then right onto the street
camera does a and we catch glimpses of paris at night
camera settles on harry just as the lights of the eiffel tower pop on sending a flood of golden lights high into the night sky directly behind him
erica sits alone at a table in the back of the room drinking a glass of wine
she looks vibrant
she glances up from her drink and sees what looks like harry making his way around the tables
she leans to the side for a better look to make sure its him
it is him and hes corning right toward her
her stomach sinks her mind races
and before she can come up with a single thought that makes any sense there he is
proud of himself i knew youd be here
ive come a long way to see you erica
you mean were not bumping into each other
you came here to see me
yes i did
she seems to shiver im aware it was a bold move one of those impulses that grabs you but
so far were okay right
well uh i mean im just
ill take that as a yes
harry takes off his coat and scarf hangs them on a hook
you want a glass of wine or something
i was just gonna give you a kiss hello
neither is sure where to go
he lands on her chin
not what he wanted but he takes a seat across from her
she looks at him utterly speechless
i remember you said if we still know each other we should go to paris for our birthdays well we still know each other
thats true but harry i havent heard from you in six months
i know but ive certainly been thinking about you
theres a lot i have to say
first thing is
im not mad at you anymore
good cause im not mad at you anymore either
thats a relief
since i did come all the way to france and everything
afraid of everything he could possibly say thank you
and congratulations on your amazing success
its been quite a ride
funny i thought maybe id hear from you when it opened
whereve you been
after i saw you in the theater that afternoon i had another episode
oh im sorry
i was actually okay but i was sure i was dying and the doctor in the er said i needed to decompress
so i did
i walked out of there and changed my life sold most of my businesses packed my bags and moved to an island in the caribbean
thats where youve been all this time
in the caribbean
harry lies on a chaise under a palm tree drink in hand hawaiian shirt shades
a steel drum plays in the distance
i was there about six hours when it occurred to me that wasting away on an island in the caribbean wasnt going to remotely cure what was ailing me
harry sits straight up into camera
a light pops on and we realize we are in harrys closet
so i decided to take another kind of pilgrimage
into my past
harry enters the closet reaches onto a top shelf and starts pulling down dozens of what used be called little black books
my thought was if i retraced my steps and visited all the women ive dated
he blows dust off of the books
maybe i could figure out how i got so screwed up
harry stands at one front door after the next each one a lot of the women wouldnt see me
then we see women of various ages slap him across the face
or speak to me
harry reels backwards from one hefty mama
but i was on a mission to save my soul
a woman in her fifties purposively walks down a small town main street carrying groceries
harry at her side keeps talking at her even though she picks up her pace and ignores him
my losing streak finally ended when i got one to open up to me
in a hospital room an older woman on life support scrawls out a note and shows it to harry who sits in a chair by herside
a priest stands in the background
the note says as i remember it you were wildly insensitive
harry lowers his head in shame
she places another note in front of him
it says i forgive you
relieved he smiles
then one last note now scram
hearing what they had to say was no picnic
in an upper west side coffee shop harry pas coffee with a woman in her mid forties
she talks his ear off
harry can t deal with it
he looks away the woman places her hand on his chin and pulls him right back to her and keeps talking at him
but i stuck it out and i listened
then i listened harder
harry walks down the street with a another woman in her thirties who carries a cello
she never shuts up
and one of the things i realized was i was actually giving closure to generations of women
at the corner the woman hugs harry goodbye
although i admit some refused to give no matter what i did
on the set of good morning america
she glances out the studio window and sees harry on the street among the folks holding signs
he holds a sign that says diane you were right
i was entirely wrong
i m sorry
she looks him straight in the eye and gives him the finger
when you hear the same story about yourself over and over your life begins to make sense and the future becomes your only salvation
it took me six months to find them all
i visited different states but i came the furthest to see you
a hand lands on his shoulder and he hears i dont believe it
harry looks up and sees handsome young julian in a beret
harry looks to erica instantly deflated
the two men hug then julian squeezes in next to erica
harry slowly takes his seat across from them
i should have told you he was coming but i was so engrossed in your story
oh maybe another time
looks from erica to julian it all dawns on him i guess i shouldve seen your play then i wouldve jknown how this ended
yeah big twist huh
so what are you doing over here man
just a uh vacation
never been to paris in january
its amazing to run into you
you look wonderful
havent been on a gurney in six months so thats somethin
well ive just been to every store in the city this woman is impossible to buy for
but i think i finally found the right gift
he puts what can only be a ring box on the table between erica and harry
happy birthday baby
he kisses her
harry watches dying
reaching for it ill open it later
harry rises reaches for his coat
no no you know what ill let you two celebrate
i cant really
you have somewhere to go
everyone at the table is laughing mid meal
julian is doing the talking as well as laughing
harry laughs along trying to be an approving part of their romance but hes totally faking it
to the forces of destiny that brought us together tonight
erica lights a cigarette
what are you doing you dont smoke
im in paris the second hand smoke will kill you anyway
shes very brilliant but the woman can not hold her liquor
julian puts his arm around her pulls her close
i like that about me
the guys exchange looks
now if i were writing this this is where id write an awkward moment
honey if you were writing this id be dead
never fails to amuse her
the waiter drops the check on the table
harry takes it
no harry please let us
no no i insist
i crashed your party
to erica at least let me buy you dinner on your birthday
squints at his watch shows it to erica what time does that say
squints i have no idea
feels around wait i have my
reaching into her purse me too
they each take out each others glasses and put them on
erica points to harry wearing her glasses and laughs
you think you look so handsome in mine
you know how long ive been looking for those
yes i do
harry hands erica her glasses
he snaps gesturing for his to be turned over
she hands them to him
julian watches all this sobered by their chemistry
tucking away his glasses once again
reads his watch so its only in the afternoon in new york
what do they do around here for fun
camera finds the three of them sitting at a small table
the place is dark loud crowded and young
theyre all drinking champagne
the air is strained
at the same time want to dance
harry gestures for julian to have the first dance
julian takes ericas hand and leads her to the dance floor
harry watches them slip through the crowd
erica turns back harry waves
julian takes erica in his arms its clear shes comfortable in his embrace
this is lost on harry and as he watches the smile on his face more than fades it evaporates and everything inside him begins to hurt
erica and julian theyre sexy together
harry is gone
harry with his collar turned up against the cold walks past the glass pyramid in front of the louvre
harry walks over the bridge the beauty surrounding him just making it all worse
he stops looks out at the seine
he hears a classic french song in the distance then sees a small barge playing the music pass beneath him
without warning a tear falls from his eye
laughs at himself at the end of the day im nothin but a sap a stupid old sap standing on a bridge in paris crying my eyes out
he stops looks at the mighty city surrounding him
beautys not supposed to hurt
almost amused look who gets to be the girl
he wipes his eyes on his coat sleeve as snow begins to fall
looking toward heaven anything else
harry turns and sees erica standing by a cab with its motor running snow falling on her hair and coat
he went back to the hotel
walking to him he said when he saw me with you he knew i was still in love with you
what do you have to say about that
if its true my life just got made
whyd you come here harry
because i realized what i was feeling for you have always felt for you was something i didnt understand like a language i didnt speak
it scared me so i did what i do
i snuck away
turns out the heart attack was easy to get over
you were somethin else
shes starting to melt and when i went to see all those women i found out i was never really present for any of them
and something inside me at some point had just
thats when i think my heart gave out and you saved me
i finally get what its all about
im years old and i am in love for the first time in my life
and thats what i came here to say
okay this is the best birthday ever
i know im no spring chicken i figure i only got another years in me
but how bout we figure out a way to make this work
ill take it
the barge drifts back under the bridge la vie en rose piping out of its tinny speakers
honey theyre playing our song
she comes close and he pulls her in kissing her great
and as they separate he smiles relieved
the same restaurant from the first scene of the film one year later
harry enters frame just like he did before
langer party of four
and a half
the maitred snaps to attention and leads harry erica marin holding her baby girl and her husband danny through the crowded restaurant
the baby fusses and reaches out to harry who takes her in his arms and proudly parades her through this swanky crowd to a round table in the center of
harry beams at the prize in his arms as he sits with his family for a sunday dinner
