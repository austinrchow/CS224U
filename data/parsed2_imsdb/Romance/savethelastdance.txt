los angeles california of an empty stretch of land parted down the middle by railroad tracks
an amtrak commuter crests the horizon heads toward us
as it gets closer we go in tighter to see pressed at one of its windows
distant and lovely and sad
superimposed against an endless stream of sky and trees
the train speeds up and saras face flies by disappearing from frame
a zaftig black woman clumsily negotiates the aisle
stops at the first of a few empty seats left in the car
this seat taken
looking up around
she shakes her head clears her backpack and magazines from the seat beside her
the woman drops down settles in
a long silence
the woman glances at the american ballet magazine on saras lap
tries to make conversation
i love ballet
never had the body for it
do you dance
sara folds her arms turns away mumbling under breath
sara gazes out the window
the world outside begins to dissolve melting into images from another time another place
her eyes stare blankly out at us blinded by her memories
a stage full of five year olds in tights and tutus
a little girl performs center stage
shes remarkably poised remarkably good
camera pans to the audience
a woman in an irish clover necklace springs to her feet clapping loudly
the little girls eyes catch the glint of the necklaces gold
she flashes a megawatt smile ends the dance with an unscripted bow as we
young sara lithe and earnest dances
a budding beauty blessed with long limbs and natural grace she makes it look easy
gliding past the envious stares of classmates she scans the hall for a glint of gold
finds it in the back of the room where her mother glynn stands watching her
their eyes connect with mutual smiles and those smiles carry us to a pair of flexing feet in ballet slippers on a hardwood floor
pan up and pull back to reveal sara at dancing in the space opened up by cornered furniture and rolled up rugs
as glynn looks on sara completes the routine with a pirouette
she spins out of it with a preoccupied frown on her face
whats the matter
it was good
checks her stance in mirror everybody theres going to be good mom
i have to be better
then beginning again my knees still knock when i do my free form
did you notice that
i noticed that it was fine
escalating frustration its not supposed to be fine
its supposed to be special
and it just lays there it doesnt do anything
i bet they notice that
that it doesnt do anything
that i dont do anything special enough to get in
youll get in
dont lie because you love me
my free form sucks
giving up that battle ive got something for you
mouth closed eyes shut
sara flops down on the sofa beside her
closes her eyes
glynn removes the clover chain from her neck fastens it around saras
for luck tomorrow
not that youll need it
you dance like an angel
the necklace is glynns talisman
sara knows what it means to her
she throws her arms around glynn holds onto her tightly
i love the necklace but youre still the best luck ill ever have
glynn not one to choke up chokes up
they cling to each other
in the blink of her eyes the memory fades
she pulls the window shade shifts in her seat
her fingers travel to the clover necklace at her throat
the woman regards her
its a good luck charm
doesnt always work
the womans wearing a crucifix
she indicates it
a sea of young white faces
a jock entertains the troops with two straws up his nose
sara sits next to her best friend lindsay
lindsay chomping on a wad of gum turns from the jock to sara with a bubble in bloom bursts it with her teeth
youre leaving for philly after first period
i wont see you
we should pray
lindsay grabs saras hand and bows her head
sara embarrassed aligns her head with lindsays
shes praying nobody sees them
awesome father s
shes ready for them
please make them ready for her
even if she screws up
sure shrug another bubble gods gotten me outta all kinds of shit
he oughta be able to get you into juilliard
sara exits with a bouquet of roses takes the steps two and three at a time
glynns waiting in a flower van at the curb
sara and glynn
the back of the van is filled with flower arrangements
glynn takes note of the roses in saras hand
whered you get those traitor
he actually told me to break a leg
roses from the principal even droopy out of season yellow ones is beyond cool kiddo
youre definitely movin up in the world
sara looks through the windshield
its starting to drizzle
know what would be great
if you didnt drop me off at the bus station
if we just kept going until we get to philly
ruin everyones valentines day and not have a shop when i get back
thats your definition of great
i can see the headline now starving artist kills unfit mother
gently sweetheart we talked about this
ill get there as soon as i can
sara looks at her and glynn instantly feels guilty
this is the hardest most important day of my life and all you can do is get there as soon as you can
glynn pulls the van into the parking lot
smiles at sara
sara doesnt smile back
shes too angry
so i guess ill see you later
i wont miss your audition sara
ill be there okay
if i have to swim the susquehanna ill be there
you cant swim mom
ill float then
they look at each other
sara finally smiles
they embrace and she hops out the van
glynn calls after her
happy valentines day
from the corner of her eye she watches the woman beside her flip through the american ballet magazine
we move back in time through their pages
sara in costume flips through a magazine
she taps her toes checks her watch
a phalanx of parents and dancers are clustered around a sign posted on the door juilliard school of dance auditions
sara stares at it
re checks her watch
an official with a clipboard walks toward her
wheres her mother
sara on stage
she looks past a row of juilliard judges into the audience
no glint of gold
mozarts elvira madigan andante cues up
sara begins her technical
she transforms her nervousness into a notable powerful performance
the judges are mutely but clearly impressed
one of them looks directly at her
is there anything youd like to share about your free form before you begin
saras stomach drops to her feet
her mothers not there and her free form sucks and she doesnt have a theme
well its um pretty self explanatory
the judges exchange a look
new music cues up
some driving classical number
sara tries to elevate her body above the music but shes nervous unsure on her feet
she keeps glancing in the back of the auditorium for glynn
searching for her port in the storm
wondering where her mother is and knowing how badly shes dancing
knowing but somehow continuing stumbling recovering and finally finishing with those damned knocking knees
the judges eyes like stones perfunctorily nod
their equivalent of maybe next year
sara chokes two words out
fighting tears she hurries past waiting dancers angrily unhooking the clover leaf chain from her neck
sara in street clothes
cramming her ballet gear into a duffle bag when the official of the clipboard approaches her
she touches saras shoulder gently
says something we do not hear
shooting through office window
a state trooper in a rain slicker offers sara a chair
the trooper talks
as he does dread and disbelief spread over saras face
she shakes her head attempts to stand
her legs buckle beneath her
the trooper and the official catch her as she falls
a glowing moon in a clear star specked sky
chugs toward baltimores penn station which is visible in the f
a torrential rain
a flower van glynns van caught in it
shooting through the drivers side window we can see glynns face intense and determined squinting through the downpour
hydro planing slip sliding
its squeal of brakes as it maneuvers into the station
the squeal of its brakes as glynn loses control and smashes into the back of the eighteen wheeler in front of her
across space and time the sound of squealing brakes commingle as the amtrak commuter pulls into penn station
holding her breath clenching her fists
waiting for the sound to stop oblivious to the stare of the woman beside her
roy johnson a handsome laconic man of uncertain style takes a last drag from his cigarette drops and stomps it
passengers disembark from the train
roy searches their faces
they all look like strangers
a conductor helps sara to the platform
steam from the trains engine is sucked into the fog
she walks through it
they see each other
roy weakly waves
walks toward her
sara watches his bow legs stiffly advance
she wants to run
have a good ride
sara self consciously tucks her hair behind an ear
slept through most of it
roy looks at her
guess you got stuff
one big one
looks like theyre unloading
we can stop somewhere if you want
im kinda tired
roy takes her backpack
a heavy silence
roy starts to turn on the radio stops himself
he lights a cigarette cracks the window
i didnt like leavin you so soon after the funeral
i wouldnt have if you hadnt asked me to go
i mean i couldve hung around
helped you say good bye
thats what you were doin wasnt it
roy takes another drag nods thoughtfully to himself
thats what i figured you were doin
sara peers out the windshield
the neighborhoods are changing
the streets are getting progressively gritty and dirty
it surprises her
it worries her
roy worries her
i feel bad too
i mean we both got hit by the same bolt of lightning
you dont have to pretend this is easy
off nothing everythings upside down right now but dont worry
well work this bachelor father thing out
hell it aint like were movin in with strangers
we got a pretty good idea about each other right
sara looks askance at him her expression indicating otherwise
roys too new at this to hold up both ends of the conversation
the silence deepens
roy switches on the radio
roys truck pulls up to a string of disrepaired rowhouses with pristine white marble steps
he and sara each lug a suitcase from the truck
her eyes wander up and down the street
theyre on the fringes of a ghetto
a few people roost on their stoops hang on the corners
all of them have black faces
thought you were moving to fells point
the second floor of a two story house has been turned into a one bedroom studio
a partition separates the living area from the bedroom
sara walks past a collection of saxophones and several framed pictures of herself
aside from the saxophones and the pictures theres hardly any furniture
roy lights a cigarette
not much of what youre used to
but the waters hot and the fridge is full
and i made room in the closets for you
girls gotta have closets right
you even get your own bed
ill crash on the couch
you bought a bed
slight bow pardon me
your own futon
check it out
on the other side
suitcase in hand sara walks around the partition
her room is an old futon an ancient set of drawers
she stands in the middle of nothing wanting something to do
she removes framed photos of glynn from her backpack places them around the room
sara walks in
doesnt see roy
do you have a phone
roy emerges from the bathroom drying his hands walks past her
of course i have a phone
you didnt at the last place
the last place i saw anyway
you grew up on me
over the summer
you blew me off for some gig on the road remember
before he can respond can i call lindsay
let her know i got here alright
are you alright sara
off the scowl in her eyes i just wanna know how you feel
i feel fine
i feel like calling lindsay
shes a wall
a brick wall
roys head aches from knocking into it
he goes to the couch
mutters at her
phones in the kitchen
knock yourself out
sara lying in bed
her stiff upper lip quivering
she slips out of bed creeps on tiptoes into the bathroom
closes the door oh so quietly behind her
she flips on the light crosses to the sink turns on both faucets
as the water flows and the pipes rattle the brick wall shatters
sara crumbles to the floor
buries her head in her arms
cries like a baby
roy and sara
barreling through the south end tongues stuck in gear
a pop tart grows cold on saras lap
i can take the school bus
thats the other oz dorothy
patterson kids ride the city metro
well i know how to do both
not around here you dont
not until you get the hang of things
sara looks out the window at a full fledged ghetto
its all to obvious the hang of things
roy glances over at her
i called about your transcripts
youre all set
pattersons got a pretty good humanities program
no ballet but we can find a studio someplace close for after school i dont think ill have time
i have to study ill be busy
roy can hear the lie behind her words
the pain too
he lights a cigarette cracks the window
he wants to say the right thing
take a break
not too long a break though
youre a dancer
you should dance
stay on top of your art
like you stay on top of yours
maybe i aint playin no grand ballrooms or fancy jazz festivals but im playing
unconvincingly i didnt mean it like that
hell i wish i had half the time i wasted gettin wasted
but those days are over
i got my life on track
formidably large and surprisingly well kept patterson serves the nearby predominantly black odonnell heights projects
kids malinger outside on the front steps and lawn
roys pickup pulls in
roy cuts the engine
sara looks at him
or through him
she wont let his eyes connect
you dont have to go in with me
since im all set
i mean i have done this before
gone to school
ill be fine
i am fine
roy regards her with weary resignation
sara climbs out
he calls after her
pick you up
over a shoulder yeah
sara moving toward us past a floating mosaic of black faces
this is a near out of body experience for her
she walks like a well rehearsed soldier in a stiff straight line to the schools entrance
its clogged with students
inside the doorway two security guards flank a metal detector
when its saras turn to pass through one of the guards grabs her backpack and wordlessly begins searching it
he hands it back to her on the other side of the detector where sara stands obtusely and mutely amazed
through a window sara seated across from an administrator
we push in
its no fun being uprooted in the middle of your senior year
we realize that and well do what we can to help with the transition
theres a knock at door
gwynn the guidance counselor steps in
the administrator introduces her to sara
sara regards mrs
gwynn with polite petulance
not even about baltimore
im not gonna be here that long
besides its just a city right
gwynn looks at her squarely
but the brick wall doesnt move an inch
sara feels too safe behind it
clutching new textbooks sara starts down the hallway
shes hoping nothing in her face reveals the rising panic in her heart
every inch of her feels afraid
as she moves forward
a crush of kids mostly black with a sprinkling of white and latino faces thrown in
kids like her
only they dont dress like her
they dress like commercials for tommy hilfiger and calvin klein
and they definitely dont sound like her
yo man check it the muthafuckers wasnt playin they was jackin
ten rides in five days
fools got caught for real too
ten years in five days
stall that shit
sara walks on taking this netherworld in eavesdropping on other conversations
its not just the words
its how they say them loud
matter of fact
a cooler cool
like they breathe static electricity
the entire student body is energized
saras thoughts are jolted by two black girls squeezing by
one clips saras elbow as she passes knocking it against a locker
they keep going as if they dont see her
no one seems to see her
welcome to mass avoidance at patterson high
saras back is to a black girl striding purposefully toward her
chenille tall pretty with about a million braids in her hair swoops saras backpack from the floor
thrusts it at her
thats how easy it is to give to charity around here
dont put your shit on the floor
cautions a smile thanks
she closes her locker starts to say something else
shes eager to make a friend
but chenilles gone
sara memorizes the schedule of classes in her hand
she passes a clutch of students who surround a kid in the middle like a horseshoe
sara gets a fleeting glimpse of him
eye candy tall
if patterson were a monarchy patrick would be king
he sure holds court like one turning on his dazzling smile and abundant charm for the crowd
one gets the sense that the all american home boy is almost as enraptured with himself as the sycophants around him
the rooms seen better days
probably better teachers too
jurasinski looks out at his american literature class and sees nothing but tenure
in cold blood represents a turning point in our countrys literature
take the cap off and tell me why that is mr
wider to include the class
favor snookie ricard
we recognize him from the hallway kids wrapped up in patrick
snookie a flagrant patrick wannabe sits next to him now
he removes his baseball cap
thoughtfully twirls it on a finger
he truly believes hes being profound
that compote dude who wrote it
straight up fag mr
thank you mr
your genius grant is in the mail
jurasinski looks for someone to put on the spot
sees the new girl in a back corner
he gets into her line of sight
the class shifts in their seats peeping her
you can catch up later
if this is over your head
everyone looks at her
the way kids look at new kids
its a non fiction novel
the first of its kind
capote mixed true events with things he couldnt know so he made them up
a small murmur goes up
over this the voice of a dissenter
white folks back then felt safe
capote scared em
he took hard core crime out the ghetto and dropped it in americas back yard
thats what makes the book special
sara cranes to see him
its pretty boy
hes sitting on the other side of the classroom
looking at her
he has nice eyes
not that she noticed
that is part of it
thats all of it
capote wasnt first
richard wright and james baldwin did the same thing
wasnt nobody tryin to read them though
lots of people read them
a defensive save
patrick sees right through it
lots of people like who
didnt think so
girl needs to bone up
give her a pass to the libary
the room erupts in laughter
flushed in the face
angle widens as jurasinski quiets the class
she can have your pass mr
since you obviously never use it
pick up sara among a cattle drive of boisterous students
hundreds of voices unleashed in pure unadulterated teenage cacophony
saras in a queue of kids working her way down the line
shes as invisible and anonymous as ever
camera tracks her from the line to the cashier into the heart of the dining hall
she stands with a food tray looking for a place to sit
table cliques of the cafeteria
two tables pushed together
barely pathetically populated but surprisingly diverse
loud overflowing fun
king patrick and his loyal subjects horse around
over which a glacial beauty we will come to know as nikki davis presides
notable for its glaring absence of color
a girl we will come to know as toni sits there
and then pushing in on shes there with a group of girls who eschew pretense
they like chenille are rugged and regular
they know who they are
eyeing chenilles table
screwing up courage as she approaches it
she gets there but two black girls are faster
they sit down in the only empty seats
sara backs off invisible again
glimpsing sara from the corner of her eye as sara walks away
time has passed
the cafeteria is half as full half as noisy
sara sits among the nerds a friendly if verbose group
shes trying to eat but a snooze button is talking her to death
i know youre new to the table but think about it
were the y k generation and nobody takes us seriously
we dont take ourselves seriously
just look around
half the student body is d
and thats from the neck up clara
and youre boring her from the ears down
sara looks up surprised to see chenille standing there
she flashes a knowing smile at her indicates saras tray
sara leaps up with a quick grateful nod
beats a hasty retreat from the table
as she and chenille walk through the cafeteria sara shudders with relief
she feels rescued
laughs gotta watch where you sit girl
and its chenille
but youre still welcome
lets catch some air before the bell rings
sara follows chenille into the quad four squared off sections outside the cafeteria
there are a few dry rotted picnic tables scattered around
other kids and they run the gamut are seen in clots sneaking smokes
and over the sound of hip hop music a pair of feet
camera pans up to reveal nikki
shes demonstrating some moves to the girls from the popular table
nikkis dancing her ass off showing off
whats it called
what shes doing
a look knows that no i mean
the step the
she trails off as she catches someone in the corner of her eye
she turns away from chenille gradually focusing on playing cards with snookie at one of the picnic tables
he glances up to see sara
glowering at him
sara rolls her eyes turns away
mutters loudly to herself
in this crowd you gotta be more specific
covertly indicates patrick hes in one of my classes
thinks hes so
i dont know about cute but he is smart
real trip too
so you know him
hell yeah i know him
hes my brother
chenille waits for sara to swallow her tongue
enjoys a laugh
as nikki approaches him
sexy standoffish and conceited shes the stuff of wet dreams and futile longing
she sits down next to patrick
close to him
snookie watches her much amused
you comin tonight
patrick keeps playing his hand
responds very coolly
you already skipped three meetings
as hes ignoring her is it because of me
everybody on the committee thinks its because of me
infuriated by his silence look patrick
youre in charge of the music
im in charge of the prom
so show up
dont make me fire your ass
snookie holds his breath
patrick throws out a card turns slowly to nikki with a withering stare in his eyes
you already fired my ass nikki
once and done
she stalks off
snookie oogles her departure peers at patrick about to say something
patrick cuts him off indicates cards
hit me and shut the hell up
ima shut up
after i say it been real frigid round here since yall broke up
specially since she broke up with you
that was harsh way she canceled your ass like a stamp for that howard u dude
but their shits over
now might be the time to forget mistakes that was made
you been with the girl since ninth grade
why you sweatin me snookie
pounding his heart cause im about you man
i want a happy ending
tuck an duck
here he comes
the hood of the hood up to no good
malakai rhinehart heading toward them
powerfully built and edgy with insolence malakai is like a tightly wound coil you never know when hes going to snap
angle widens and we see patrick is happy to see him
he and malakai grin at each other
interjecting himself did i tell you malakai man how chill it is to have you back
we aint been bad without cha
shut the fuck up and step your lame ass off snookie
you heard me
snookie haughtily comedically obliges
what happened to you at lunch man
patrick understands it nods
malakai slips the cigarette from behind his ear openly lights and starts smoking it
camera tracks them walking back toward patterson
so youre hangin in man
feelin strong about being back
not at this motherfucker
out a week and where am i
fucking home sweet high school
jail away from jail
you can have it
you gonna stay though
judge says its school or juvee and i sure as hell aint goin back there
i never knew a year could be such a long time
a flash of commiseration of guilt crosses patricks face
theyre at the doors now
most of the kids have gone
malakai puts his cigarette out on the floor as they step in
you up for some hoops after school
break your free throw back in
chump the chumps like we used to
up for it
hell the fuck yeah man
lets do it
sara exits with chenille
a car horn starts to blare
both of them ignore it
but it goes on like a musical number
sara gets a sinking feeling that drops like a stone when she looks across the street
roys parked at the curb waiting for her
she rolls her eyes and he honks again
then he waves at her
chenille looks at sara
then at roy
thats your old man
now hes cute
sara climbs in slams the door
roy looks over at her unaware of how annoyed she is with him
shes a clenched fist inside
howd it go
as he pulls off tomorrow i catch the bus
saras moving the partition around trying to make her room more like a room
trying to build another wall between her and roy
cmere a minute
sara lets out a heavy sigh
what does he want
just come here
she walks into the kitchen
roys in front of the open freezer door
grinning from ear to ear
he motions her over
sara crosses to the freezer
its full of frozen dinners
theyre in unruly lopsided stacks
roy regards her expectantly
hungry and healthys
i asked at the market
theyre the best
what do you feel like
whimsically lamb chop suey
i had a big lunch
roy deflated closes the freezer door trails her into the living area
saras clenching again
theres no escaping him
what do you wanna do
you wanna hang out with me
go to my gig
you can if you want
its a school night roy
sara takes her first good look around
it drives home where she is
what shes lost
an empty beer bottle one askew kitchen chair
vestiges of roys meal
angle widens as sara enters
she opens the freezer to unearth a dinner and starts an avalanche of falling food
a box of sugar puffs cereal lands at her feet
something else out of place
she picks it up jams everything back into the freezer
slams the door shut
in a whirlwind cleaning the apartment
wall to wall
scrubbing away whats churned up inside
the dervish ends in her room where she finishes unpacking
several layers into a suitcase she comes to her ballet shoes
the sight hits her like a slap in the face
sara stares at the shoes until her eyes blur
then she snatches them up and entombs them deep inside her closet
patrick chenille snookie straggle through the dreary jungle of concrete lawns and blighted high rises on the way to school
its quiet now but the scars of past battles like the bombed out police substation on one of its corners are evident everywhere
i need a date why
your hand busy
for the prom
and if it wasnt for that kinda undue attitude you could be the lucky girl chenille
my personal prom queen
i can see us now
you must be lookin in your dreams
snookie glances at patrick
hes somewhere else
help me man
i got my own problems snook
you goin to college
doctor college after that
you large man
i aint gonna be doctor nothin if i dont get in and im not in til i get my letter
its in the mail patrick
wishfully thinking i probably coulda been a doctor too
if i hadnt got left back that time
fifth and sixth grade dont count
patrick finally laughs
then his face changes
he hops a low wall keeps in stride above them
they continue on like this the ruins of their world in the b
the bus is crammed with kids
sara seated by a window doesnt bother looking out
insides more interesting
the kids cut up
singing rapping and jousting with each other
some even manage to read
sara watches with immunity
shes invisible to them
sara alights just as patrick chenille and snookie walk past
patricks the only one to see her and their eyes briefly connect
patrick and chenille pass through metal detectors watch snookie clown his way through
the security guard shakes his head
all three begin to walk
snookie bobbing and jiving doesnt see mrs
gwynn coming up from behind
her voice stops him cold
as patrick and chenille look on light on your feet
be sure they dance into my office next week
she moseys on
snookie regards patricks smile shakes his head
the class has donned lab coats and is ready to begin when sarah rushes in
she tries to slink into a seat
the teacher mr
hill gives her a disapproving look points at one of several formulas c h o on the blackboard
sara just looks at him were cooking today ms
this is your first lab
youll need a partner
reynolds patrick will show you the ropes
patrick bounces a smile off unsettled sara
this should be fun
the class in safety goggles and gloves has partnered up
hes holding two vials
sara picks up a beaker
stares at the blackboard
she has no idea and no intention of admitting it
very casually thats too big
she glints at him grits through her teeth
i know its too big
she puts the beaker down
picks up a vial
flips through her textbook
her eyes shift from it to the blackboard trying to make a connection
she settles on one
picks up a vial of powder
patrick grabs her hand leans over and whispers
i wouldnt do that if i were you
yanks her hand back who died and made you teacher
patrick pulls back looks at her
he cant believe she dissed him
a small smile forms on his face
sara turns away from it goes back to her vials
patrick slides to the farthest end of the table
watches her consternation with bemusement
know the difference between ethyl glycol and methyl acetate
both got three elements two parts the same
its that first part c versus c
c could blow a vial right out a persons hand
sara thinks hes messing with her
but then the contents of the beaker begin to ominously bubble
panicked she drops the vial into their sink
it instantly goes up in smoke
some of the liquid splashes on saras lab coat
patrick grabs a wet towel quickly wipes it off
the class stops cold
hill rushes up to them
once hes sure saras fine he looks sternly at patrick
everybody back in your seats
patrick stares at sara
her face is red
shes biting her lip
i misread the component
even more angry now you
you misread a component
dont give me that patrick
you were screwin around
hills tone is searing
he turns to sara
shes trying to say something but the words wont come out
hill regards her wearily then walks off pushing the curious class back to their stations
sara looks at patrick weakly mouths thanks
over the sound of grunting
open close on a girls plump ass
squirming in too tight gym shorts that hug the cheeks
angle widens to reveal a stout white girl on a balance beam
trying to get her legs to stand up on it
hanging on for dear life
from somewhere around her a whistle blows
widen to see the teacher and her class favor sara chenille and nikki
amid snickers the stout girl diggy slides off the beam walks past the teacher with her head demurely cast down
clearing the teacher diggy pivots around both middle fingers in the air
gives up the double bird with much attitude
the class loves it
until the teacher swerves around
chenille on balance beam
competent but average
nikki on balance beam
and then tighter still on sara
tentatively approaching the balance beam
mindful of all the eyes on her all the bated breaths
all waiting to see the new girl fall on her ass
sara swings herself onto the beam with aplomb
her legs and body are strong supple pliable rubber bands
she flounces across it on her tiptoes
does a flawless split
reacting with shock and surprise
except for nikki
she stands there with her arms folded
heading down the steps with other students
chenille and diggy break through the logjam catch up to her
girl how you get your legs to twist like that
wildly gesticulating yeah
what was all that double jointed cheerleader shit
this is diggy
thinks shes down
egg cuse me
i am down
whats up with that
awkwardly nothings up with it
i used to kind of dance
chenille makes an impressed face
regards sara curiously
you should hit feetz with us tomorrow night
its a club
sorta members only
un der ground
i dont know
come on and hang out
snook dees sometime
he can get you in
yelling yo snook sara sees snookie
loping her way
she steels herself
hes going to say something crack some joke about her nearly blowing him up
but patrick just stares at her with a twinkle in his eyes
a nice twinkle
saras not entirely immune to it
chenille breaks their eye play pushes patrick aside
she grabs snookies arm indicates sara
she needs to get hooked up for feetz
all the way up
sara give snook twenty dollars
how you think you gettin in
on your looks
rolling his eyes chenille your girl is weak
i got my rep to watch
i cant just be gettin any green in
regards snookie with a sweeping scowl
and if i still look green i think maybe you should wipe the crust from your eyes
snookies jaw drops
patrick cracks up
chenilles stays on point
shes about solving the problem
you gonna pay the man or what
she aint got it
look at her
loud talkin me and broke as a damn promise
sara put on the spot pulls out the money
snookie snatches it
i dont even know where it is
so well hook up at my house
i will have your i
snookie shrugs affirmatively
patrick looks directly at sara
the twinkle in his eye is gone replaced by fair warning
feetz aint no square dance
i dance in circles
probably around you
roy walks in to see sara on the futon in her pajamas reading a book
shes got a head full of rollers
as she barely looks up whatcha readin
youre takin chemistry
right now its taking me
give yourself some time
see ya in the mornin
maybe ill call between sets
sara really looks up
gives him an angelic sluggish shrug
ill be asleep
as soon as sara hears the front door close she jumps up strips down to bra and panties races to the closet
one hand rips the rollers from her hair the other rips through outfits
shes frantic and unsure about choosing the right one
in a skin tight miniskirt and a bolero jacket
looking more eighties than nineties more cute than cool
she walks with tentative jittery purpose down this poverty stricken street
doesnt meet anyones eye
but can feel the eyes on her
she keeps going
shes walked too far to turn back
approaching the malignant edifices as the heights begin to come to life
or death depending how lucks running
sara walks into this world of shadows and despite a trepidation finds something fascinating about the possibility of real danger
chenille triple unlocks the door lets sara in
saras surprised the apartment is surprisingly quaint and extremely neat
it looks a helluva lot better than roys place
chenille is dressed in hugely baggy military style pants and a tube top with a form fitting short cut leather coat over it
sara takes it in
i look okay
chenille gives her the once over
decides to lie
you look okay
then moma dean
grandmomma dean enters with a toddler christopher in her arms
she sports snow white waist length dreads and shes wearing a dashiki lounger
despite her white locks she doesnt look old enough to be a grandmother
she hands christopher to chenille
her eyes are open kind
fussing over christopher grandmom sara
also known as momma dean
and handsome here is christopher
now dont get him all riled up chenille
i want to get some sleep tonight
chenille kisses christopher hands him off to momma dean
sara looks tentatively at chenille
he sure aint momma deans
theyve been talking
well chenille has
saras been listening
liking this confidence theyre sharing
hell be one in july
best mistake i ever made
kenny christophers father hes the worst
a curbed cab
sara and chenille get out
chenille digs into her pocketbook hands sara her i
push in on photo of obese white girl with an untamed trailer trash perm
saras eyes go wide
shes twenty one too
i aint got all night
i have to ask you something
hard for her do i really look alright
an unspoken thing passes between them
chenille suddenly whips off her coat
gestures at sara with her head
gimme that madonna shit
give it here
sara takes off the bolero
chenille ties it around her own neck then yanks saras miniskirt down around her hips
saras torso is clad in a long sleeved cotton tee
chenille frowns at it
its from the gap
you look country in it
take it off
im not walking in there in my bra
chenille thrusts her leather coat at her
sara cant believe what shes doing getting un dressed on a public street
she pulls off the tee slips on chenilles coat
buttons it as far as the buttons go
half her chest is exposed
gaining on what looks like an abandoned warehouse
chenille snorts at the roped off queue of kids waiting to get inside
she leads sara to the door of feetz
the sumo sized man guarding it knows chenille digs her
his grin exposes gold capped teeth
too fine to stand in line
the man grins opens the rope lets them in in being just inside the front door
a bouncer there collects the
checks their i
he hands saras back with a smirk
changed your hair
he waves a metal detector over their bodies nods to yet another bouncer who escorts sara and chenille through yet another door
they march a short distance to an old elevator where a group of kids wait
bouncer engages the elevator
everyone piles in
sara holds onto her stomach as the creaky elevator descends and the music below rises
the elevators vibrating with music
an inside to chenille cant get much more underground than this
a smoky hole in the wall filled to the brim with kids
mostly black kids with a few whites and latinos melting in
they share a common goal to clog the dance floor flaunt their outfits and get nasty with the music of the masters tupac shakur nas lauryn hill puff daddy etc
here the boundaries of dirty dancing are pushed from erotic to vulgar loving to lascivious
sara and chenille
she loves that she has to shout to be head over the music
lets get our table fore it gets crashed and i hafta hurt somebody
she doesnt see any tables
she follows chenille to the back of feetz
sees six or seven tables
all of them have reserved signs
most of them are filled
what are you some kind of v
chenille indicates the deejay booth
snookies in it
snook hooks me up whenever he dees
they walk past a slacker in lycra pants and a big army shirt
he licks his tongue at chenille grabs at her protruding butt
she swirls around grabs his crotch hard enough to get his attention
the slacker is squirming in her clutch
you got it
as he cant think of anything but the squeeze on his balls the right to walk past your greasy tickle dick self without your paws on my ass
sthat how i got it
chenille bobs her head right in his face
sara cant believe it
a few people have stopped and are looking
the slacker nods hastily
chenille releases him gently smoothes out his shirt
thats how i thought i had it
a fly wave see ya
she and sara continue on to back of the club tables
stop at a reserved one
an adjacent table sports nikki her three girl crew
all nurse drinks
nikki snake eyes sara
what is up with this place
seems like theyre lettin anybody in
and they started with you
the three girls and diggy snicker
nikki gives chenille a look
turns back to sara with a snide smirk
points out her crew
you know diggy right marsha
and i know you
we have a class together
that dont mean you know me
quit it nikki
i aint walkin on eggshells just cause you brought the brady bunch to the negro club
kiss my ass polite maybe you came to the wrong spot nikki
im pretty sure this one doesnt have any negroes
chenille cracks up mainly to back sara up
nikki glowers at her
im pretty sure you came with one
uh uh wench
you did not just call me a negro
as chenille bucks diggy springs up from her seat runs her arm in the space between chenille and nikki like a referee
tell her to chill
she always got somethin to say
i can say a lot more
keep runnin your mouth nikki
ill lay all your shit bare
whatever shit it is nikkis not taking any chances
she ejects herself from the table walks off
the three girls scoot loyally after her
diggy gets up
sits down at saras and chenilles table
diggy goes with the flow
thats why she always fits in
why you burn her like that
cause i cant stand her ass and the way she played my brother
i need a drink sara
patrick and malakai enter with two high school dropouts we will learn are arvel and lip
females flock to flirt with patrick and malakai who both swell like sponges soaking up the attention
chenille pushes her way to the bar tugging sara along
a tall angular twenty something man on the far side of the bar sees her
she sees him
sucks her teeth nudges sara
so of course sara does
she makes a silly face at chenille as kenny sidles up to her
chenille rolls her eyes half heartedly
wheres my money kenny
im a little short this week
dont jump off
lemme rap to you about the situation on the dance floor
she shakes her head firmly but her eyes do tell
shes in love with him
enough to let him whisper in her ear sweet talk her away from the bar
before shes swallowed up by the crowd chenille turns back to sara shouts rum and coke
hook me up
splitting off from malakai and a girl clinging to him
hes walking through when nikki appears from nowhere grabs his arm
pulling away lets not
its gonna be like that
howd you think it was gonna be
that you was gonna drop me and pick me up whenever you felt like it
it aint all that serious patrick
it aint anymore nikki
not to me
he walks off
camera tracks him going deep inside the club
he wants a drink
hes almost at the bar when he sees chenille on the dance floor with kenny
she shrugs a smile then cocks her head over at the bar
the look is like help me out
dont let me leave her hangin
patrick rolls his eyes as he glances at sara before he really sees her
she looks fly
he ambles up as she shouts into the bartenders ear
rum and coke straight up
and a beer
i dont care
the closeness of his voice startles her
she turns into his smile
that cocksure leaveem weak in the knees smile
its just a beer
then it should be the best beer
youd know that if you really drank
saras knees straighten her spine stiffens
the assholes back
whats that mean
whatever you want it to mean
youre the whiz kid right
you know everything
chuckles at this at her not everything
like i dont know why were standin still
closer with a teasing whisper im supposed to be dizzy by now
from all those circles you danced around me
sara leans against the bar
the knees are going again
i dont feel like dancing
but you do know how
would i be here if i didnt
lets do it then
he coaxes her onto the dance floor
parliaments funk classic flashlight is playing
the dance crowd is robustly singing the refrain to the song
theres a party on the floor
favor sara and patrick facing each other
hes moving already
she starts to dance stiffly tentatively
patrick smiles at her
shakes his head
he grabs her hands swings them in time to the music
now move your hips
not so fast
as sara looks lost sara
just like our hands
singing in sync with the crowd flashlight
everybody got a little light under the sun
the musics beginning to feel good to sara
patrick lets go of her hands
starts to dance
sara watches him intensely her body follows his stiffly
patricks a good teacher
he leads without leaving her
whenever she misses a complicated move he smoothly segues into another less complicated one
sara begins to pick up on patricks rhythm
her eyes never wander from his
and then she starts to feel something else
they both do
a rising beat
a quickening heart
and not from the dancing
she smiles bashfully at him
patrick suddenly grabs her around the waist pulls her to him in a sexy spoon dance
all sara can do is try to keep up and hang on
nikki avidly watching sara and patrick with jasmin and tiffny
shes all up in your nut nikki
oh thats right
it aint your nut anymore
it is if i want it to be
he is if i want him to be
that bitch aint got shit on me
the girls regard her in conspicuous dubious silence
nikki maintains her cool but inside her pride is pricking
malakai and the clinging girl nuzzle in a back corner
she licks his ear whispers into it
then his expression abruptly darkens
a storm cloud comes over it
he gets up
two dealers a few feet away
theyre talking to an asian guy with a multi colored mohawk
one slips mohawk a packet of coke the other takes his money
wider as malakai reaches the dealers
he doesnt explain doesnt complain
he just starts swinging
the music changes and their dance ends
they stand there for a moment a little caught up in each other
a little unsure of the moment
and then theres a scream
several of them actually
patrick reacts to it instinctively
in a small pocket of the club he sees malakai
in full fisticuffs with the two dealers
holding his own
leaving sara slicing through a clot of looky loos until he reaches malakai
he jumps into the fray
a thick crowd around them proceed to beat the living shit out of the two dealers
wrangling their way to the front line of the crowd diggy not far behind them
sara looks on dumbfounded and dazzled by what she sees which is pummeling his dealer into cowering submission
only then does he look over at malakai who eyes engorged with rage is standing over his opponent kicking and stomping him with no signs of letting up
patrick can see malakais too far gone for talk
he rushes him from behind nearly lifts malakai off his feet to swing him away from the dealers writhing body on the floor
the exit door bursts open and patrick and malakai tumble out
patrick bends over cups his knees as he catches his breath
man what the hell are you doin
tryin to get sent back up
they the ones tryin shit
squarin off in my shit
you couldnt let it slide
let it slide tonight they come back strong tomorrow
you know that
malakai you fuck up parole you aint gonna back to juvee
eighteen and up thats jessup
you want that
regards him coldly i want what was mine
feetz is my spot
ima do business here just like i did before
like we did before
and if i gotta stomp some niggers in my way so be it
an uncertain but tense moment
patrick tries to salvage it
well you definitely got the stompin part down
they look at each other
share a small laugh
we fucked those fools up for sure
crossing to exit door for damn sure man
patrick finds the door locked
he and malakai hoist themselves over a high wrought iron fence
disappear behind it
distant wail of sirens as feetz begins to empty out
kids converge on the sidewalks
pick up sara chenille and diggy
waiting and watching for patrick
diggy looks at them
its about to get real out here
cops and shit
chenille spots patrick
not too worse for the wear
she smiles with relief
then sara sees him
she smiles too
sara patrick and chenille
chenilles preaching to patrick
hes not in the mood
yeah ima tell you
tell you like i keep tellin you patrick
you need to let malakai alone
let him handle his own shit before he drags you down in it
i heard you the first five hundred times
they round a corner bordering the heights
stop in front of it
chenille disconcerted with patrick looks dourly at sara
ill see you monday
to patrick like an order hell walk you
as much as this makes sense it still takes patrick by surprise
sara sees it in his face regards chenille with a false bravado
its just a few blocks
no its not okay
would you tell the girl it aint okay
its not okay okay
before she can protest come on braveheart
sara keeps stealing glances of him
or so she thinks
why you keep lookin at me
i have to look somewhere
the streets are deserted
might as well look at you
thats not why
you wanna know somethin
its not a question
its the way you were beating that kid up
you looked so mad
i was mad and he wasnt no kid
but youre from the suburb mars right
folks dont fight there
not like that
some kind of wonder you were really kicking his ass
its not funny the look on her face
but patrick laughs
are you laughing at me
dropping the smile patrick shakes his head
looks at her
my friend was in trouble
maybe hes my question
chenille doesnt like him
she likes him
it dont stop her from trippin off him now and then
but malakais good people
we go back
you know like they say through thick and thin
beat so howd you like feetz
it was great
once you got used to the music
it wasnt the music i wasnt used to
i mean its not the first time i heard hip hop patrick
bet you listen to it all the time
patrick regards her with a sly knowing smile
his stare is significant unsettling
saras face flushes
she turns from him hoping he didnt see it
not all the time
but a lot
we gettin any closer to your crib or should we stop for food and water
sara snaps out of it
first the flush and now this
she looks at him
she could kick herself
we passed it
you passed it
they double back to her front door
pause on the stoop
thanks for walking me
ill see ya
is that see ya like gee whiz had a great time cant wait to see you again
or is it like see ya ill bust a cap in your ass if you ever darken my doorstep again
he makes it impossible not to smile
so damned charming
i havent said gee whiz since i was six
but i really had a great time
she enters the rowhouse
patrick waits until the lights go on inside before he turns around and starts home
roys making breakfast when sara straggles in
she peers at the stove
scrambled eggs and bacon
a first for him
figured id put a little marrow in your bones
she slumps in chair you gettin along at school
as she nods robotically see any of em last night
he slides a plate in front of her
stands there holding his
i came home on my break
the succinct sneer in her voice gets to roy
he snaps at her
if you wanna go out go out
but dont lie to me
on top of everything else dont make me worry like that about you
after long moment i didnt mean to yell
sits down trying like hell so how are the eggs
sara takes a small tasteless sample nods
they eat in silence
then sara looks over at him with genuine if detached remorse
i shouldve said something
finally a chink in the brick wall
whatre you gonna do today
a track from top dogg blares from invisible speakers
all of the stores many customers are teenage kids
snookie in sunglasses and a reversed baseball cap clerks behind the counter
hes ringing up and trying to rap to a fly girl when patrick walks in overhears the overture
how you know i cant do nothin for you
im the hardest workin man in showbizness girl
let me be the bomb in your shell
the fly girl rolls her eyes
takes her bag
patrick looks at snookie wryly shakes his head
you do the shit to yourself man
the bomb in your shell
that was black magic patrick
its gonna work one of these days
he reaches behind the counter hands patrick a jay z c
last one on the rack
i snatched it up for you
rang it up on my discount
what snookies waiting for thank you snookie
as patrick pays him you workin or what man
on my way
soon as i get outta here
as he says this his eyes wander around the store
and he sees her in the stacks
sara with a bunch of c
she juggles them in one hand flips through hip hop c
s with another
she looks up to see patrick standing beside her
he takes in the c
grins at her
throwin a party
theres no wiggle room but sara wiggles anyway
just adding to my collection
i heard some stuff i didnt have last night
that twinkle in his eyes well you were fly anyway
dancin i mean
not as fly as you
half serious nobodys as fly as me
dead serious not yet anyway
looks at her
sara looks back at him
theyre staring at each other
maybe we could hook up later
after school or somethin
work on some of your moves
if you want
patrick nods affirmatively
starts to leave
turns back indicates her stack of c
by the way hammers pretty much played out
convincing lie not to me
saras on the phone unwrapping one of those t
into phone it was so
im going again
no i havent seen anybody get shot yet
god i didnt move to bosnia
two black girls having at it
its a ferocious match
hair pulling spit flying punches landed clothes torn apart
as she crowns the corner comes to a bottleneck of students
its like the nose bleed section of caesars palace
the far hallway is the ring
sara cranes her neck to see the action
angle widens as a security guard earns his hazard pay
he separates the two girls who are still swinging at each other
he throws one into a corner hurls the other in an opposite corner
as a white girl standing next to her shakes her head lamentably
the white girl studies saras suburban clothes and fresh scrubbed face
thinks she found a kindred spirit
we freed the slaves and didnt teach them no manners
before sara can react youre sara right
as sara warily nods toni
i was gonna introduce myself before but youre always with that crowd
chenille her girls that identity crisis diggy
sara looks at toni
the expression on her face closes off
toni too dense to read it keeps talking
brightly we should hang out sometime sara
the two of us
whenever you decide to lose the tan
her inference clear toni flashes a brilliant smile happily walks off
sara shakes her head to herself
what an idiot
as sara continues down the hall a p
address comes on
seniors a reminder before you rise up and change the world
gwynn is holding all diplomas hostage in her office
her only demand is the pleasure of your company for career d day
sara enters her classroom a bunch of kids in front of and behind her
sara walks up the street passing many black people sees roys pickup
sara as she enters their rowhouse walks up a flight of stairs to their apartment
theres a jazz instrumental faintly coming from it
and another noise
foreign and yet familiar
sara unlocks the door
her fathers fucking somebody
on the couch
half on it anyway
in broad daylight
the whore underneath him is moaning
angle widens as sara turns away from the spectacle
reaches for roys sax
she blows the longest shrillest note known to mankind
the hair on his head stands up
his body deflates instantly
sara sits at the table
roy enters in a wrinkled t shirt and battered jeans
his embarrassment is naked
i dont know what to say
how bout fuck it
or should i say fuck her
its a fuck fest roy
dont talk to me like that sara
beat i thought you were goin to your friends house after school
obviously you changed your mind
so im sorry
sorry you got caught
sorry i got
observed the whore with the hich c is rhonda
she stands between the living area and the kitchen entrance now
sara tries not to look at her
cant help it
she has to see the whore
not bad looking in a washed out bottle blonde barfly kind of way
dont be mad at him
its my fault
im real sorry honey
its nobodys fault
let it be over
were all adults
sara glares at him
the disingenuous rhonda jumps in
i think he means you know about sex
that we have it and he likes it
isnt that what you mean roy
sara looks at her
bats her eyes
how often do you have it
things been kind of slow since you got here
once upon a time we were real rabbits werent we roy
roy can feel himself sinking
open close on a framed photo of glynn and sara in full ballet costume
pull back to see sara
sitting on the edge of her futon holding glynns clover leaf necklace and staring at her mothers face
she kisses the lucky charm smiles at glynn slips the necklace on
patrick in coveralls slouches over a mechanics station studying
a few workers mill about waiting for the next car on a slow day
a bmw with tinted windows peels into the lot on two wheels
patrick looks up as malakai and a tall wiry nattily dressed man get out
i got it
he exits into the lot
approaches malakai and the man medicine man
you know tute
tute takes in patrick
you call this a job man
actually i call it a car wash
the work i do yeah thats a job
malakai lets out a nervous laugh
tute doesnt crack a smile
i need some sticks
watch my ride malakai
tute enters the cashiers office
patrick looks at malakai
you hangin with him now
think thats a good idea kai
you got a better one
you could try layin all this shit off for awhile
give yourself a chance on the other side
what other side
you know what i mean
it aint like you dont have good sense
i got sense enough to know who i am what i can do and where i can do it
i aint like you
people dont just up and hand me shit
tute emerges from cashiers office lighting a cigarette from a fresh pack
he blows a plume of smoke into the air regards patrick
we aint here for our health
you workin then work
throws patrick car keys and dont forget the rims
patrick still in work coveralls enters
first thing he does is pick up a stack of mail
tracking him into kitchen as he crosses to refrigerator takes out a plate momma deans left for him
he sits down at the table takes a breath begins shifting through the mail
his face registers disappointment
patrick sits across from mrs
gwynn the reality check of patterson high
maybe you think its enough to have the grades get a full scholarship
but it isnt patrick
georgetown makes mulch of students like you every semester
you have to be ready to change
your entire point of view
what im saying is options wont matter if you dont keep a clean nose to the grindstone
looks her right in the eye i know that mrs
the unflappable patrick
he doesnt fool mrs
doing is hard
in which a series of students parade in front of mrs
i wanna operate on cars
some place fly like the kentucky derby
joke on you
that the same as a job
a rock n rap club in l
im gonna put a tattoo parlor on the roof
soon as i find some investors
i want to be a lawyer but i believe in god so im not sure about it

i hate it here
im a year behind cause of my baby but im gonna work during the day go to school at night
thats my plan anyway
i plan not to be poor
i get into u
financial aid everything
do i detect a but
nikki folds her arms regards her obdurately
i know youre how do you put it
large here nikki
you enjoy that and its fine for now
but you cant live your life like a popularity contest
i dont think its realistic what youre asking
and the changes change you
whats the point of plans
to have a sense of direction
you cant direct destiny
fingering saras papers i see here that you trained for juilliard that you auditioned
that was a long time ago
it was three months ago sara
the brick wall well if youre not going to pursue dance what are you going to do
hadnt thought about it i dont know
take a year off
go to college later on
be careful with later on sara
its a slippery slope
sometimes you can run right on top of it and it never catches up with you
a low sun over the cityscape of baltimore
push in on patrick and sara two dots that grow larger
he clicks on a boom box resting on the roofs ledge
a hip hop track blasts
feel the groove
dont let the music mess with you
he starts to move with the music
sara tries to emulate him
they dance throughout the conversation
did you always want to be a doctor
who said i wanna be a doctor
he cinches her waist pushes in her ass
keep it tight
watch your butt
what kind of doctor do you want to be
i like kids
come on stay with me
do you have any
i wasnt being smart patrick
wouldnt be the first time
he goes into a spin a half split comes out of it swaggering and half stepping around her
sara gives him an impish look
rises up on full pointe turns out her legs and lifts one of them in a spiral just below his head
it happens in two blinks
so fast patrick thinks it was a mirage
he stares at her dumbfounded
the look on his face is worth the pain in her joints
she blows some stray hair out of her face puts her hands on her hips
looks appropriately hapless
i didnt get it
that thing you just did
show me again
what was that shit you just did
he mimes the move badly
sara cant help it
with a twist
succumbs to his bewilderment ballet
i used to dance patrick
you used to dance
used to as in dont any more
and dont ask me why
she sounds suddenly defensive
patricks suddenly intrigued
because i dont want to talk about it
thats why you brought it up
did that whole relieve thing
cause you dont wanna talk about it
because its not a big deal
can we just concentrate on this
yeah we can concentrate
a beat goading her a little but i think it is a big deal
whatever it is you dont wanna talk about
sara shakes her head adamantly
he nods his head emphatically
they dance coyly seductively around it
doing stretching exercises as she talks on the phone
over phone im still gonna pray for you
jesus sara youre in the freaking ghetto
forget the riots
how are you supposed to meet anybody
sara slides down the wall hugs her knees
into phone i have met somebody
i mean theres this guy
patrick enters to hear christopher screaming his lungs out
he passes down the hall to chenilles room to find christopher squirming in kennys arms
kenny doesnt know what to do
walking in what yall doin to my nephew
patrick takes christopher holds him and consoles him until he settles down
patrick pointedly hands the baby to chenille glares accusingly at her and kenny as he quits the room
kenny regards his son haplessly
looks at chenille
whys he do that
hes a baby
he was screaming chenille
he dont know you kenny
im his father
he knows me
meaning now what should i do
come around more often
i cant talk to you
and i cant depend on you
am i askin you to do anything for him you aint supposed to do
you dont ask chenille
you make demands
you want money you i want you to pick up some of the slack
you always have an excuse
its not like that
i get tied up
you wanna talk about tied up
try gettin up in the middle of the night to change diapers and give him bottles or stayin up with him when hes sick and havin to drag your ass
to school the next day
im doin the best i can
it aint good enough kenny
dripping out of order faucets graffiti laced stalls litter strewn floors are underscored by the spooky flicker of fluorescent lights
sara walks in
the bathroom appears to be empty
shes about to enter a stall when she hears the murmur of a voice
a guys voice
then a girls whimper
she eases forward a bit
i dont get paid til next week
boo the fuck hoo
you cant put my bizness up your nose on no layaway plan
you know what you gotta do
sara ventures carefully forward to the edge of the stalls open door
she cranes her neck trying to see without being sen
a girl is seated on the toilet
a man straddles her his crotch in her face
the girl sees sara
something in her face gives this away
the man glances out past his shoulder
he looks right down our throat straight into saras eyes
what are you doing
malakai backs up
the girl jumps up runs out the lavatory
malakai zips up his pants
saras frozen staring at him
you didnt see nothin you dont say nothin
not unless you want a taste for yourself
and that can be arranged
sara waits a moment
she sees mr
hill starts to move for him
someone grabs her arm from behind
she turns startled a little afraid
its the girl from the stall
she looks sara in the eye
shakes her head
hill walks by them unbeckoned
a perfect day
camera pans from the waterfront to the bustling crowds of the inner harbor then to a park across from this where sara and patrick are practicing
hip hop music softly plays from patricks boom box
sara watches his face as they dance
didnt you like it when you used to dance
yeah i liked it
i was gonna go to juilliard
that school fucked up my entire life
its a long story
let me guess
you dont wanna talk about it
sara looks at him
a soft smile is all she offers up
they lay on their bellies in the grass
close to each other
i stole a bike here once
whyd you do that
cause i didnt have one
thats a good reason
i used to do wild shit like that
you and malakai
most of the time
i dont get you guys
you seem so
maybe you werent then but you are now
you said you changed
doesnt make me different from him
not the way you think it does
i think malakais scary
and i know youre not
taking mild umbrage what you mean by scary
he has to be
he still got a good heart
sara stares at the ground struggling to tell him what she saw
let me finish
me and him got into some shit awhile back
real bad shit
we held up a gas station off
i bailed the ride jumped out the car
kai kept goin got caught
pauses i knew what he was gonna do that night
knew the car was hot
i woulda been guilty as him if they had caught me if malakai had served my name up
but he didnt
that means you owe him something
he did his time plus most of mine
i owe him that
no matter how much he messes up
we all mess up
maybe malakai gave up
but hes still mboy and he still got a chance
i aint just gonna cross him completely off and be like everybody else
he looks at her and she doesnt have the heart or the nerve to tell him
a long moment
she plucks a dandelion from the grass twirls it thoughtfully in her fingers
i stole a hat once
when i was twelve
my mom found it under my mattress made me take it back
stole a hat
call the f
she looks at him
twirls the dandelion under his nose
you gonna turn me in
i think ill wait for you to surrender
pauses were you tight with your mom sara
i mean yall get along and shit
got along and shit so she meant something to you
how come you never talk about her
theres nothing to say
studying her face know why theres nothing to say
because you dont talk about her
you wont talk about her
im sorry shes dead
what do you want me to do
run through the streets screaming
if it helps
tersely well it wont
so drop it
and you call malakai scary
she looks at him
sara knocks her legs against his
he knocks his legs back
a silly moment
but it transcends the tension and creates a sweet truce between them
momma deans fixing dinner
patrick enters with the mail in his teeth a load of books in his arms
he dumps the books on the counter busses momma deans check on the way to the fridge
i know youre not puttin those dirty hands inside my refrigerator
patrick backs up to the sink
washes his hands
impishly dries them on her apron
he sits begins sifting through the mail
momma dean pulls an envelope from her pocket
waves it at him
this what youre lookin for
chenille appears in the doorway
patrick takes the letter
hes almost afraid to open it
but he does
and as he reads the letter a slyly relieved smile spreads across his face
he tosses the letter in the air
grabs chenille and momma dean
and the three of them jump up and down together with joy
dressed to the nines
they look happy and relaxed more so than weve ever seen
they sit close to each other
are you gonna tell me where were going
as he grins shakes his head why is the surprise for me
youre the one with something to celebrate
we can celebrate together
she looks at him
cant find any words
so she just goes into her evening bag and pulls out a small box
she hands it to him a little nervous about how it will be received
i wanted to get you something and i couldnt figure out what
its not much but i hope you like it
patrick opens the box
removes a key chain
its engraved with the medical emblem snake staff etc
he regards her touched
i like it
i love it
she leans in turns the key chain over in his hand
the back side of it is engraved with the words patrick reynolds m
patrick locks eyes with sara lifts her hand to his lips
kisses it softly
the gesture is succinct but alluring and for a brief moment theyre the only two people in the world
the bus makes a stop and an older white woman gets on
sits across from sara and patrick who have moved even closer to each other
patricks arm is around saras shoulder
he whispers something in saras ear
she laughs and looks up to see the white woman staring at them with a muted but obvious repugnance
watching the woman from the corner of her eye sara drapes her arms around patricks neck nuzzles at his ear
patricks eyes widen
sara playing this for all its worth folds one of her legs between his and whispers we have an audience
work with me
nonplussed work with you
sotto voce through her teeth grab something
he grabs her ass what else is there
runs his hand along her side
the white woman thoroughly disgusted gets up and moves to the back of the bus
patrick and sara look at each other burst out laughing
the equivalent of d
s kennedy center the hall is awash in lights and activity
men and women are donned in formal attire
parking valets hover on the sidewalks waiting for cars
into this sara and patrick walk
she looks at the crowd then sees the overhead banner boston ballet a command performance
saras heart stops
her feet freeze
patrick looks at her
she looks positively catatonic
quietly urgent i cant
i cant go in
doesnt understand you have to go in
this is where im bringing you
beside herself i know but crestfallen but what
sara looks at him feeling bad
feeling stupid for ruining the evening
she bites her lip shakes her head but nothing
patrick takes her and they go in
sara and patrick watch the boston company perform igor stravinskys scenes de ballet as choreographed by christopher wheeldon
theyre both enraptured
but while patrick keeps sneaking excited glimpses of sara her eyes remain fixed on the dancers the dance
she is utterly totally engaged and amazed
the yearning that never really left her returns to tug at her heart and project her soul onto the stage
post ballet sara and patrick walk
shes quiet introspective
patricks at a loss
he cant decipher her mood and which is more hes disappointed by it
i thought you would like it
you aint actin like you did
she looks over at him tries to smile
they come to a small secluded bridge
sara sits down on the edge of it
patrick follows suit
a long moment
i dont want you to think i didnt have a good time tonight patrick
but ballet isnt a part of my life anymore
you just woke up one day and decided to waste your talent
without rancor how do you know i have talent
because i did some stupid leg trick
i saw the look on your face when you did it sara
the same look i saw tonight
so if youre gonna tell me somethin about not dancing at least tell me somethin real
a long difficult moment wherein sara attempts to find the words face the pain that comes with them
finally she looks at him
maybe i dont want it to be real
she stares out at the water the moon reflected off of it
its hard to reconcile that beauty and the turmoil shes feeling
but she goes on
what i want is to wake up and see my mom
for things to go back to the way they were
when they made sense
when my life made sense
because and its all my fault
she got scraped off the highway for me for my fucking audition
she was rushing
it was raining
it was raining
a torrent but she promised to be there
i made her promise
and then i didnt wait for her
i should have but they called my name and i didnt say anything
i just went out and danced
i was mad
i needed her and she wasnt there
she buries her face in her hands breaking down racked with tears and guilt
patrick puts his arms around her
inconsolable she was dying while i was dancing and i was mad at her and im sorry
its not your fault it rained or she died
or that you danced
thats what you were there for
your mom wouldve expected you to do what you did
sara choking on tears regards him forlornly
thats what makes it so bad
she always did what was right for me
i wanted to be a prima ballerina had to be
even if it took most of our money all of her spare time
i didnt care
it was my stupid dream and it killed her
all she wanted was for it to come true
you still got whatever you had when your mom was alive sara
she wouldnt want you to give up
sara swipes at her face looks up at him still crying
i just dont think i can do it without her
holding her do you want to do it sara
i mean you
do you want juilliard
then its on you to make the dream come true
for my mom
patrick walks sara to the front door
they pause on the stoop
neither of them wants the night to end
see you tomorrow
a rhetorical question under the circumstances
patrick regards her tenderly moves her hair from her eyes
stares deeply into them
sara smiles wanly certain she looks like shit
but it doesnt matter
the moment has named itself
and so with more certainty than passion they kiss
camera pans the room picking up small touches from saras past life her previous bedroom more on display than weve seen before
hold on closet door
a beat before sara emerges from behind it ballet slippers in hand
she takes a deep breath
slides them on
peers down at her feet
nothing magical or mystical but simply wonderful
like the end of a long days journey to home
sara and patrick negotiate the heavy pedestrian traffic exit the complex
he leads her to a mall of trees and bike paths
lemme see that move you did
that cute leg relieve thing
as she shakes her head come on sara
hates to admit this it hurts
im out of shape and it hurts
admiring her thats what you call outta shape whats it take to get you in shape
this is the perfect spot for that
you can run around and i can sit under the trees and watch you
i dont get in shape like that
but its still a good spot
diffidently i got my application for juilliard
just in time too
theyre holding auditions in baltimore next month
she looks at him shakes her head
not that great
ill never be ready in a month
sara you puttin the mojo on yourself
a smile in spite of herself mojo
white folks call it karma
the bad kind
you dont understand
ballet takes a lot of time a lot of preparation
i used to practice two three hours every day
im so far behind
and unsure and afraid
which patrick can sense
but he wont let her go there or stay there
hes firm matter of fact
quit whinin and catch up then
its not as easy as that
my free form still sucks
its still the weakest part of my routine
that hasnt changed
so ill help you with it
surprised that shes surprised yeah
ill help you
tell me what you need to do and lets get busy
sara in the mirror dressed in leotards and tights
she bends forward from the hip extends a leg a corresponding arm
as she tries to complete the arabesque the backward most leg buckles
she steadies herself
hip hop hybrid with patrick
struggling to keep up
on way to and from bus stop
practicing as she walks
alone with her instructor
alone with her instructor
soaking and tending her bleeding feet
open close on a black hand shaking a white one
pull back to reveal patrick and roy
sara enters looking striking pretty very down
chenilles influence is written all over her makeup and her clothes
overlooking roy she blithely tags patrick
cursory to roy later
roy stands in the middle of the room dumbfounded
mumbling to himself three months and shes skipping
usual suspects usual music
patrick hands sara a call brand beer
leans in with his drink openly and contently with her
nikki and her crew jasmin tiffnee alyssa
nikki hasnt seen patrick and sara
shes showing her crew a dance
chenille diggy and another black girl
a chrome domed deejay with a barry white baritone bellows into his mike as he changes the music
master p with the ghetto d
showmesomethin showmesomethin give up that cruel
eyes on you
wider as the dance floor swells with kids
pick up sara and patrick among them
she looks at him nervously
nobodys watchin you but me
a gallant lie
sara tries to believe it
practice has made her near perfect
their movements are ambitious nimble better than anyone else on the floor
they move so well together that snookie dancing nearby starts chanting go patrick
jiggling and wildly gyrating
chiming in go sara
building up a sweat confidently dancing at fever pitch
everybody have funk funk funk
sara and patrick still going at it
snookie diggy and others prance around them like backup dancers
standing with her crew dourly observing patrick and sara
watch me squash their shit
shoving pushing and barging her way up to patrick
without preamble or regard for sara she starts dancing with him
patrick looks at sara but hes somehow dancing with nikki
sara retreats with daggers in her eyes
unresponsive as she grinds her body into his raw and wild
standing where she can see but cant be seen from the dance floor
from a curtain of kids malakai suddenly appears at her side
sara cant move
shes boxed in
malakai indicates nikki and patrick with slick satisfaction whispers derisively
you aint never gonna look as good as she does with him
aint no point in tryin to mix
he evaporates into the crowd
sara stands there
as a slow dance begins
nikki starts to press herself against patrick
patrick holds her off with both arms
moving toward sara
a stark apologetic expression on his face
he takes her hand
sara fiercely jerks away
patrick grabs her hand again more emphatically this time
but sara wont budge from the spot where shes standing
so patrick slides his arms around her holds her without moving
they remain like this for a moment or two until they slowly begin to dance
we push in on them in this little space
patricks lips brush saras ear
slow dancing with his flavor of the night
eyes on sara and patrick
both underwhelmed and resentful of what he sees
sara unlocks the door
she and patrick enter
she turns on the lights
looks at him
answers the unspoken question
hes in d
hell be gone all night
patrick sits down on the sofa
sara crosses to the stereo turns it on
a sax solo begins playing
the only one he ever cut
kinda grows on you
somewhere between five seconds and forever
then wanna see my room
patrick looks at her nods
he gets up follows sara behind the partition into her room
they stand there for a moment
he cups her face with his hands
they begin to take off each others clothes alternately sure and fumbling a bit awkward a bit urgent
sara unzips patricks pants catches something other than his clothes
patrick winces in pain
she looks at him with an embarrassed grimace
says this very low
they kiss again stumble backward to her futon
fall down upon it and begin to make love
camera tracks them as they walk down the hall hand in hand sometimes exchanging greetings with other students
they are officially a couple and they appear to be in love
at the door to saras next class patrick busses her lips before she enters
no teacher is present
the class files in
toni drops down in a chair beside sara
she leans over in a conspiratorial whisper
whatever you do dont fuck him
hit it and quit it thats their motto
everybody knows that
the teacher walks in
sara quickly whispers back to toni
dont forget they all have big dicks and beat their wives
everybody knows that too
malakai along with snookie and two brain donors arvel and lip eat at a booth
patrick strolls in gritty from work
tired from work
he slides in next to malakai
the mood is light jovial
you smell boy
how can a piece of shit tell
the table cracks up
you been scarce lately man
where you been
somewhere dreamin of a white christmas
and christmas aint even for nother six months
its a so to speak thang you ignorant fuck
looks at patrick so
so to speak
snatching up one of his ribs back out my business boy
watching patrick keenly you tappin that white girl man
half joking thats why you aint got time for your boyz no more you too busy frontin
too busy snowflakin
patrick lifts one of malakais ribs responds coolly
how am i frontin kai
i made time for this bullshit didnt i
thats why your jaws are gettin so tight
you the one need his jaws tightened with your pork ass instigatin self
re patricks roving fingers order somethin patrick
this aint no goddamn soup line
patrick grabs some of arvels fries chews them in his face
yall hangin tonight or what
we thinkin about slidin through that new rec center opened up on the eastside
thats the wrong side
i aint messin with those fools over there
you know how they are
i aint pressed
i got my own shit
the table stops
malakai glances around lifts his shirt to expose a gun
patrick stares at malakai with disbelief
what you think
ima keep walkin around waitin for some chump to cap me
ima protect myself
that aint protection
its an excuse for some unnecessary mayhem
aint nothin unnecessary bout it
mayhem and madness
thats a black mans life
how you know
you aint tried nothing else
now you sittin up here strapped for no good reason
you askin for trouble malakai
as malakai laughs you think this shits funny
snookie shifts uncomfortably
arvel and lip look at malakai
malakai looks at patrick coldly drops his smile
i think its funny you think it aint necessary
you act like you dont know where you are no more patrick and whassup out there for anybody who aint you
maybe thats what happens when a white girl goes to your head
or gives you some
fuck you lip
looks at malakai i know whats out there
i also know you can get past it
but that aint gonna happen kai long as you keep gettin in your own way
yall said what you had to say
we back to bein boyz
have some ribs
sara and patrick post coital
shes in her robe
hes dressed but theyre fooling around as they fix sandwiches
patrick drops down in a chair
sara drops down on his lap
whats your favorite flower
i dont have a favorite
yeah but if you did
maybe cymbidiums orchids
theyre sort of show boaty but theyre pretty
whats your favorite color
whats your second favorite color
youre makin this real hard sara
those aint exactly tuxedo colors
sara swings her legs around facing him straddling him
what are you talking about
i was tryin to get around to askin you somethin but since im some sorta nut you probably wouldnt wanna go to prom with me
she throws her arms around his neck kissing him
patrick slides his hands under her robe cups her breasts
sara responds to him
they are too engrossed in this intimacy to hear the front door opening to see roy until he walks in and sees them
sara leaps up closes her robe
patrick doesnt know what to do
roys eyes dart between them settle on and slice into patrick
patrick it is patrick isnt it
a small awkward nod well i think you were just leavin
patrick stands up
sara grabs his arm defiantly holds him back
why does he have to leave
were all adults
he either leaves or i throw his ass out
your call sara
patrick jerks his arm free from sara grabs his jacket off the back of his chair
he back talks roy as he passes him
you dont have to come off with all at
who the hell are you to tell me how to come off
youre in my house alone with my daughter
it takes everything patrick has to keep walking until hes out the door
it slams behind him
sara marches up to roy furious
i hate being your daughter
you ruin everything
she tries to stomp off
roy kicks a chair in her path
not a request an order as she sits its a free country you can hate me
aint like thats exactly news
but disrespectin me thats where the road ends sara
i dont want him up here again
i mean it
you mean it because hes black
dont start that bullshit
whys it bullshit
because you hang with black guys and play jazz and have the hots for angela bassett
because he was in my house with his hands all over my daughter
keep telling yourself that
just dont expect me to believe it
i saw how you looked at him
but you didnt see him
well for your information hes a straight a student with more heart and guts than youll ever have
well when are you gonna have the guts to say what you really want to say to me sara
screaming at him want me to say it
you were a piece of shit husband and youre a piece of shit father
you were never there for mom or for me
you took off and never looked back
so dont talk to me about guts
not quite the truth but near enough to sting
it quiets roy down
he regards her with regret and guilt
sounds like you have it all figured out
i have you figured out
you think you can make up all the time you missed all the things you didnt do
im here because i have to be and its a goddamned nightmare
well you might as well wake up and get used to it sara because thats the way things are sometimes the way life is
how the hell would you know
youve been asleep for the past thirty seven years
now she does storm off
this time roy lets her
he cant find the words to deny what shes said
a break between classes draws the requisite claques and cliques
sara and patrick huddle over a chemistry book attentive to each other
nikki stands off watching both of them
malakai saunters up to her smoking a joint
hazily indicates patrick and sara
the love boat
that bitch is tap dancin on my last nerve
looks like shes tap dancing on your last boyfriend
she got it like that
i aint heard shit
what you hear
some trash shes talkin
how you aint all at since patricks takin her to the prom
in for the kill i am a little bit
chagrined though nikki
you lettin some white ho show you up like that
he regards her with bemused pity
nikki with all her inner outrage manages to salvage her pride
she sneers in his face
fuck you malakai
fuck her too
gaily a she sails off aint no need in fuckin me
stuck up bitch
im on your side patrick drinks at a water fountain
malakais standing there
theres still some tension between them
me and the boyz fixin to shoot some hoops
us against druid hill
if you interested
gotta skip last period
i got study hall
dont matter anyway
not with those suckers
ill be back before the bell rings
they walk off together and after a few steps begin dribbling imaginary balls down the hall
a girls basketball game in progress
saras playing defense
shes on nikkis team
she blocks a shot but chenille on the opposing team gets it on the rebound
nikki shoots sara a murderous look
stupid uncoordinated bitch
a four on four game in progress
patrick malakai snookie and arvel versus the druid hill two deuces
an unseen boom box blasts the music of jay z throughout
patrick has the ball
he passes it to malakai
they ad lib insults to the two deuces
this is heaven for them
talking shit and playing ball
the best time
sara takes her defensive position against an opposing player successfully blocks the shot tries to slam the ball to nikki
it clips nikkis head bounces out of bounds
nikki her dignity stunned her patience out walks up to sara shoves her to the floor
sara looks up at her as some disembodied voice calls out dont start nothin wont be nothin
stay down girl
malakai dribbles the ball around one of the two deuces skies it
misses the hoop
passes it back to kai
he takes the shot
patrick and arvel strut victoriously
sara jumps up shoves nikki back
and the fight is on
as the dejected deuces look on malakai high fives patrick and snookie
arvels moving into their circle when shots ring out
everybody on the court instantly dives to the ground for cover
sara and nikki tumble to the gym floor
the surprise is sara
she matches nikki blow for blow
its a punishing fight for both of them and it only ends when the gym teacher separates them
a car speeds off
patrick raises up looks around
snookies crawling to the exit snot nosed and crying
then they see arvel
sprawled on the ground
covered in blood
he seems lifeless
in adjacent chairs across from mrs
gwynns empty one
a hiss under her breath it aint over bitch
i dont even know why it started
and dont say its about patrick because its not
its not about him
its about you
white girls like you
creepin up takin our men
the whole world aint enough
you gotta conquer ours too
i like him he likes me
and if you dont like that screw you
gwynn walks in
looks reproachfully at them
i think you need to talk
roys tuning his sax when sara enters
her face is a mess
yet she drifts by bruised and bent over as if this were the norm
roy does a double take
what the hell happened to you
i got suspended
she straggles into her room
roy follows her to the futon
as she nods like no shit sherlock why were you fighting sara
sardonically im not sure
i think its some kind of black female thing
he sis down beside her instinctively reaches out to touch her face assess the damage
sara sharply flinches away
but roy persists and after a moment she lets him minister to her
patrick walks in arvels dried blood stained into his clothes
chenilles cooking with a sound asleep christopher slung over her shoulder
she and patrick regard each other morosely
patrick slumps down at the kitchen table
hes barely audible
almost to himself cant even play a got damned game of ball no more
chenille comes up behind him
squeezes pats his shoulder
you see sara
as he looks up with a question mark you didnt hear
nikki jumped off at her in gym
it was fierce
given the day this is the straw on patricks back
he bolts from the table and on his way out nearly bumps heads with kenny
patrick rings the doorbell
sara opens the door slightly just enough for patrick to see her face
it pisses him off
roy appears in the space behind her looking out
sara can feel his presence
her eyes implore patrick
its not a good time
gently shutting the door ill see you later
the laundromat is empty but for a few customers and nikki
shes loading clothes from two large baskets into washers when her brother diondre races in
hes grinning from ear to ear
diondre what your butt doin here
a taunting twist i can go where i want
you the one on punishment
nikki swings a wet shirt with no intention of hitting him
she looks up
patricks standing in the doorway
diondre runs up to him holds out the palm of his hand
there she go
gimme my two dollars
patrick pays him
diondre darts out
patrick walks up to nikki
nikki clenches tries to dismiss him with a backhanded wave
whatever it is i dont wanna hear it
patrick leans up against a washing machine and for a long moment just looks at her
the walk there has composed his emotions
i thought you had somethin to say to me
you thought wrong
an old black woman is avidly openly watchin them
patrick indicates a bench on the other side of the laundromat
nikki petulantly follows him there
patrick looks at her
somethin must be on your mind for you to get up in saras face start all this drama
what you tryin to prove nikki
youre the one tryin to prove something
stuck up in her shit like shes somethin special
what if she is
whats it to you
you didnt see me trippin off that howard dude and i could have
i coulda tripped hard nikki
that was different
how you gonna call it different
she stands up
looks down at him
raises her voice
because shes white and he aint
and dont sit there like you dont know what im talkin about patrick
glaring at her you dont even know what youre talkin about nikki
yall black men soon as you even think about goin someplace good first thing you do is find a white girl to take with you
patrick glares in the old womans direction then back at nikki
i thought i was goin someplace good with you
you the one called me off
but you aint tryin to remember that
now you mad
because shes white and i like her
im with her
youre with her because shes white
thats what sets me off
exasperated it aint got no business settin you off
me and her aint got nothin to do with you and what you think
so keep your hands off her and that shit to yourself
nikki folds her arms across her chest looks at him defiantly
i dont think it i know it
but you go ahead deny it
thats what yall always do
she turns on her heels goes back to her machine
patrick rises sees the old woman glinting at him
he holds her hateful stare for a moment then walks out
chenille and kenny
in the middle of a contentious moment
he tries to give her some money
she snatches it out of his hand
kenny looks at her
chenilles too mad to see it
im supposed to get excited because you decided to skate by and drop a dollar on the dresser
its more than a dollar
and its all i got
beat i got laid off rom b
i been workin part time
you know how you are about money
thats way i havent been coming around
chenille stares at him for a long moment
her voice is low
money aint got nothin to do with it kenny
you dont come around because you dont feel like comin around
you dont want the responsibility of comin around
as long as you out there and im in here you know your sons being taken care of
you aint got no worries when it comes to him
and you dont have no feelings when it comes to me
all you do is bitch and complain about what i dont do
i get sick of that
be sick of it
you aint got to see me to see your son
ill be sure to keep that in mind
chenille stands there mad at him
mad at herself
the lowest common denominator for misery
the room is filled with young women most them black and children of all ages
they are piled up like cars on a freeway waiting to be seen
the noise level is at a peak when chenille and sara walk in
chenilles carrying a fussy christopher his diaper bag and her backpack
sara wanting to be helpful reaches for christopher
want me to take him
chenille shakes her head
walks to reception to sign herself in
sara takes in the faces of girls younger than herself the grime and gloom of the room
its incomprehensible that this is a place where sick children are brought to get well
chenille finishes at the desk
returns to sara
they cross to a corner of the clinic where they sit on the floor
chenille indicates the receptionist bitterly
you gotta stand over her to make sure she puts your name on the damn list
chenille starts to change christophers diaper
he starts to wail and flail
chenille cant placate him
one of his kicks connects with chenilles open backpack sends books and papers flying
sara can see the veins stand up on chenilles neck
ill get em
chenilles finally got control of christopher but hes still crying
chenille slips off his dirty diaper
when sara hands her a clean one chenille regards her strangely as if just remembering that shes there
so your old man flipped about the fight
with some animus probably thinks its all patricks fault
i explained about nikki
you put it all on her
none of its on you
she started it chenille
she wanted to start it
i told you what she said
chenille flashes a look finishes up with christopher
she picks him up puts a bottle in his mouth
maybe she didnt have no business gettin in your face
but she had a reason to say what she said
sara studies her trying to fathom the remark
so you agree with her
you think i dont belong with patrick
what i think dont matter
but you and him act like it dont bother people that youre together
like it dont hurt people to see
her irish up we like each other
what is the big fucking deal
its him and me
not us and other people
the white girl with the rose colored reasoning
chenille glares at sara her voice designed to snatch the blinders off
black people sara
passionately patricks about somethin
hes for real
he aint gonna make no babies and not take care of em or run the streets fuck up his life
hes gonna do somethin with himself
here you come white and right and you take one of the few decent men left after jail drugs and drive bys
thats what nikki meant about you up in our world
sara sits there stupefied
theres only one world chenille
pauses i thought we were friends
guess i was wrong
she gets up walks out
something in chenille wants to call after her but shes too miserable too torn up inside to do it
patrick and malakai nurse drinks
the music fails to move them
they have too much on their minds
malakai fires up a cigarette
so what you gonna do
how many times you gonna ask me that
its payback time
either you down or you aint
either you mboy or you not
simple as that
patrick takes a long moment
the choice is simple
its the decision thats complicated
he downs his drink
even if i did ride you aint got nobody but lip and lip will get a niggers ass killed
eastside aint got no firepower
i got some shit man
we go in get out with one spray down
just then snookie and sara walk toward them from the dance floor
something in their faces unsettles sara but snookie oblivious dances up to the bar snapping his fingers and bobbing his head
you see us patrick
a storm warning you see us man
snookie rebuffs him keeps talking to patrick
me and sara lit it up
y e o w
bumps his butt against sarahs hip does a very ungainly half split
sara and patrick exchange smiles
malakai isnt amused
he flattens snookies ass with the business end of his foot
snookie sprawls flat on his face to the floor
now malakais amused
sara looks at patrick
patrick scowls at malakai
that shit aint funny
springing up damn right it aint funny
i thought you liked it down there
thats your specialty aint it
that was a reflex action man
and you just plain rude and wrong to bring the shit up in mixed company
saras not quite sure what theyre alluding to but she doesnt want the displeasure of malakais company
she taps patrick
i gotta get home
malakais eyes slice into her
first snookie now this bitch
steppin all over his conversation with patrick
no he aint ready
a b conversation
c yourself the fuck home
a real reflex action fuck you
malakai lunges for her
the move is so swift and sudden patrick overturns his stool to dive between them
he sweeps sara behind him into the path of a startled snookie
stands there nose to nose with malakai staring him down furious with him
have you lost your motherfuckin mind man
sara frightened and frozen doesnt know what to do
snookies voice weakly creaks out
hes trying to rise to the occasion
patrick man cmon
but malakai and patrick stay where they stand
too close for comfort
both in the danger zone
malakai regards patrick with a combination of cruel anger and deep genuine hurt
you take that bitchs back and wont even cover mine
cause you wrong malakai
you been wrong
you aint worth shit no more
venomously get out my face and take that ho with you
patrick bucks up
sara walks over to him gently clutches his sleeve
its no easier to turn away from malakai than it is to walk away from a lifetime of friendship
but patrick does
with sara holding onto his arm at his side he turns and walks away
a heavy silence
sara looks over at him
patrick doesnt say anything
but after a moment he reaches down and takes her hand and they walk on like this together
over music e
busta rhymes dangerous
practice her free form a hip hop ballet hybrid
theyre both tired irritable beaten down
theyve been there awhile
sara makes a misstep
sara grits on him
we should keep going
you messed up
i know i messed up
ill get it right the next time
you gonna get it right now so you can do it perfect next time
she glares at him exasperated
so many things bottled up
i cant work like this
i cant dance like this
you dictating to me
he crosses the room cuts off the music
looks at her
sara walks over to a window seat near him
whats wrong sara
except i cant figure things out
you aint got nothin to worry about
i told you
ill be there
things between us
things between us and them
i didnt know there was a them
well open your pretty brown eyes look the hell around
hes so nonplussed everythings screwed up
nobody wants to see us together not even chenille
i dont know why they feel that way
how can i know
maybe they have a point patrick
they only got a point if you believe they got a point sara
she looks at him
and loves him
and doesnt know what to do
im just saying that we should think about this thats all
thats a fuckin nough
why are you getting mad
because i like to think for myself run my own life and i thought you did too
sara looks at him
now shes getting mad
youre never gonna run your own life as long as you keep running back to malakai every time he fucks up or fucks you over
shes crossed the line
but patrick responds so deliberately so calmly prosaic that she doesnt immediately realize it
first of all malakai aint never fucked me over
second of all you dont know him sara what he been through
matter of fact you dont know shit about none of it
so dont come off to me like you do
i know hes lost patrick
everybody but you can see that
and if you keep reaching back for him youre gonna wind up lost too
until he erupts
who the fuck are you to say hes lost
malakai had my back when you were busy gee whizzin in the woods with your backward ass redneck friends
they werent rednecks
patrick yanks his boombox off the floor glares at her
you know what
the hell with you
sara yells after him
her voice echoes in the empty studio
the hell with you too
sara exits looking pretty much like she feels
she walks a few paces
their eyes connect for a brief awful moment before they continue on their respective ways
saras at her locker
patrick walks up to her
she looks at him tries to smile past the dour expression on his face
patrick doesnt say anything at first
thought you might need this on saturday
i aint gonna be able to make it
he hands her an audio cassette of her free form music
sara gazes at it then up at him understanding what this means
she wont let him see how it shatters her
he hesitates as if he wants to say something else
but sara turns her back on him and patrick walks away
approaching saras locker
having seen the encounter between patrick and sara shes as smug and overbearing as ever
youre better off
that menace to society wouldve broken your heart and spent all your money in a news flash
trust me on that sara
sara stares at her uncomprehending at first
she resists the urge to slap the smile off tonis face
she gets in it instead
toni listen carefully
youre a simple bitch and you dont have any friends black or white because nobody likes a fucking asshole
she storms off leaving toni for once speechless
caught up in a throng of kids and somehow very separate from them
the walls have been transformed into veritable billboards for the senior prom decorations are everywhere
sara continues down the hallway almost aimlessly into the
carrying a food tray eyes searching for a place to sit
she picks up chenille and her girls at one table
nikki and her crew at another
patrick and snookie
and finally toni
sara dumps her food into a trash can walks out
she pushes the tape from patrick into an ancient recorder
the music comes on
she takes to the floor
her face is like a pinched nerve
she wants to cry
she tries to dance
saras on the futon flipping through a photo album
pictures of her and glynn
roy knocks on the partition
waits a beat before he comes in
he looks at sara
she keeps flipping
i was wondering
how long you plan on hating me
maybe im an optimist but i hope theres some kind of timetable
this raises a small smile well i dont wanna bug you
i just came in to say good luck
sara regards him quizzically
roy goes to her dresser picks up an envelope from juilliard
i saw the return address
it was open
i read it
i know i shouldnt have but at least now i have an excuse to tell you how proud i am of you sara
quietly miserable i was gonna tell you about the audition roy
i meant to
shes clutching the photo album
roy sits down next to her
tomorrows the big day
the big day
you bummed out about it
as she shakes her head youre a worse liar than i am father
youre not so bad
close to a confession i didnt give you much to work with
its not like ive been the perfect daughter
well it aint like i deserve a perfect daughter
i screwed up
did everything in a hurry and still thought i had all the time in the world
to be in love with your mother
be a father to you
but time flies
you look up one day and all you got to show for yourself is a pretty little girl who hates your guts and wont talk to you because too much
time went by
saras eyes well up
before she can stop herself shes crying
i dont hate you
i miss her
i miss mom
as roy takes her in his arms tries to console her patricks pissed at me
im pissed at him
hes not coming tomorrow and i want him there and i dont know what to do
sara draws back from roy wipes her tears
you want him there
i understand that
but whatever he brings to the table patrick cant dance for you sara
youre the bottom line out there
this is your chance to be the dancer juilliard came to see
i wanted somebody there who loves me
roy regards her softly significantly the irony implicit
i love you
sara looks up
for the first time in her life she believes him
patricks bouncing on his knees speaking to arvels parents who are clearly stricken
arvels father stoic holds his wifes hand
arvels mother kneads a kleenex her face etched with tears
patrick hugs her
stands up to see malakai frozen in the doorway put off by the palpable grief
patrick crosses over to him
they retreat quietly into the corridor their concern for arvel a shaky ground for conciliation
why his moms cryin like that
arvels gonna make it right
that whats his nurse said
she told me herself your friends gonna make it
did that bitch lie to me
talk to me patrick
is he gone
patrick steers malakai away from the waiting room backs him against a wall and in a gentle but firm way holds him there
they just got bad news man
they dont need to hear it again
trying to be strong faltering arvels fightin
hes gonna pull through
thing is when he does they dont think
arvel aint gonna walk again
in that moment whatevers left of malakais soul crumbles
he looks at patrick with aggrieved disbelief and then a building anger
a stronger man would probably cry
patrick eases his grip
malakai straightens his body cocks his head slightly
studies patrick in this crooked derisive way
i got a good reason now man
off patricks silence awight college boy
you do what you think is the right thing
ima do what i know is the only thing
he starts to walk off doesnt get far before patrick calls out
a fleeting hesitation when its on ill be there
groups of children scatter around worn out playground equipment
the gleeful squeal of them is everywhere
patrick guides christopher down a slide chenille catches him at the bottom
christopher cant get enough of this ride and patrick and chenille repeat the routine throughout their conversation
why you so quiet
off patricks brooding look patrick reynolds aint got nothin to say
thats a first
catches her son with a whee
then you know how i go off on folks sometimes
i mean it and then i dont mean it
like what i said to sara
guess she told you
monotone i dont care what you said chenille
your ass is on your back and your lips are on the ground
you care baby brother
and not just about what i said
as he looks at her you seriously like sara
she got a serious jones for you
am i lyin
its besides the point
whatever point it is you tryin to make
im sayin you cant help who you love patrick
at least you found somebody who loves you back
patrick regards chenille impassively
hands christopher to her
i gotta go
sucks her teeth you aint through with that fool yet
hes not a fool chenille
you know what
youre the fool patrick
you think you let malakai down and all you did was try to pull yourself up
aint no blame or shame in that
very low a broken smile i still gotta go
check you later
holding christopher chenille watches patrick walk out of the playground
she and christopher move on to a seesaw
chenille bobs him up and down on one end of it
shes snuggling in christophers face when the other end suddenly drops to the ground
chenille looks up
theyre side by side on swings
christophers nestled against kennys chest soundly snoozing
they slowly swing throughout
it cut me what you said
means this i shouldnt have
i was trippin
you always trip
im used to that
besides you were right
you were wrong too
so was i
i need to do better
aint no doubt about that
i know i come down on you hard about money but i would rather you spend the time
jokingly so you dont want any money
i didnt say all that
gently rubs christophers brow
looks at her
chenille smiles at him
i love my son chenille
you know that dont you
i always knew that
of the building the downtown skyline etc
the house lights are on
several seats in the front row are taken up by judges for juilliard
further back are the families and friends of other dancers
push in and favor roy among them
warming up other dancers all in costume around her
her eyes wander from the clock to the stage door
a sign on it reads juilliard school of dance baltimore auditions
she stares at it fingers the clover leaf necklace with an unsettling sense of deja vu
with a pince nez with a clipboard navigating among the dancers with a clipboard
she calls out johnson
patricks waiting on the sidewalk
malakai pulls up in tutes bmw
lips in the backseat
patrick gets into the car
it takes off down the street
rap music blasts on the radio
no one in the car is saying anything
malakai has a between his legs
he sips from it passes it to patrick
patrick takes a short swig passes it back to lip
as he does this a set of keys fall out of his jacket into his lap
patrick picks them up
looks at the key chain his present from sara
he looks at malakai
as malakai glances at him not understanding this aint helpin nobody kai
i mean it
stop the car
here we go
furious what you mean you out
you think ima let your punk ass bail on me again
patrick starts to open the door
malakai speeds up
the car careens down the street squeals around corners
finally comes to a red light
patrick starts to open the door
malakai grabs him by the jacket
pulls his gun
patrick looks at malakai and now he sees him
sees that hes lost and desperate
what you gonna do kai
you gonna shoot me
youll have to
let him out
we dont need him
shut the fuck up
patrick jerks himself loose
opens the door
malakai cocks the gun
patricks face flinches at the sound of it
he can feel it trained on his back as he gets out the car
but malakai cant do it
wouldnt do it
he takes off like a bat out of hell
patrick heads down the street
as he walks he can hear the sound of gunfire behind him and then the sound like an explosion
a car horn goes off in a persistent drone
stands there for a moment
then hes walking again
without looking back
and then hes running away from the mayhem behind him
the bmws tangled around a street lamp
inside malakai slumps over the steering wheel a bullet through his head
pince nez leads sara to the stage
sara walks onstage
she nods down at the judges looks out into the audience
her eyes anxiously search for patrick
her music begins
griegs peer gynt morning
sara starts to sway moving like an angel through the soft cloud of this music
her line proportion and balance are impeccable
tchaikovskys swan lake tanz der schwane begins and sara slowly blossoms opening herself up to the music like a flower
she completes every turn and twist and leap with confidence energy and persuasion
she is doing what a dancer should do engaging the audience igniting their imagination drawing them in
perking up taking notes attentive to her
finishes with a flawless arabesque
one of the more imperious appearing judges removes his glasses speaks to her
saras still trying to catch her breath
you prepared a free form
does it have a theme
clears her throat emotion
the judge turns around shouts to someone we cant see cue johnsons music
music up a remix of hip hop e
lauryns hills doo wop nass we will survive and jay zs latest and snatches of classical
she finally walks up to the edge of the stage
looks down at the judges her eyes filled with trepidation
her voice is a shaky whisper
i wasnt ready
can you start it over again
the judge waving off the music
he regards sara impatiently
are you ready now
before she can respond patricks voice booms from the back of the auditorium
angle widens to reveal him coming forward
rushing for the stage
he pauses at the apron of it
looks up at sara
she peers down at him astounded
he smiles at her
she smiles back
patricks eyes softly take her in
you can do it
because aint nobody watchin you but me
saras eyes focus on him
turns to the judges
as her music cues up patrick slowly backs away from the stage
sara begins to dance
she starts out strong and gets stronger
every emotion she feels every experience shes had comes to life in a way that weve never seen before not even when she was practicing with patrick
her body has finally found a way to get inside this kind of music to elevate its meaning and transform her dance
the music ends
the lights go up
sara stands in the middle of the stage breathless sweating
she lifts her head slowly and the angle widens to reveal
patrick letting out a giant whoop
the judges react and the audience gasps
as he bounds onto the stage and
roy jumps to his feet
proudly and loudly clapping
just like glynn
overwhelmed beyond belief
patricks coming toward her
she flies into his arms free and happy overjoyed
but the triumph of her performance and the sheer bliss of the moment are transcended by something deeper and clearer which is her love for patrick
struggling to maintain their and the proceedings decorum since the audience caught up in the throes of this excitement has begun to loudly enthusiastically react
ladies and gentlemen please
to patrick young man
get off the stage
wider to reveal the room
patrick hugging sara looks down at the judges
all due respect if yall dont let this girl in youre crazy
sara pulls patrick back
walks alone to the edge of the stage composed and professional again
she regards the judges with a beaming resolve and a ballerinas curtsy then simply says thank you
turns back to him
the judge smiles
i cant say this on the record yet
but welcome to juilliard
lovely and radiant as it breaks into a cheek to cheek smile
wider as she walks slowly deliberately back to patrick
looks at him
and then she throws her arms around his neck kissing and hugging him
patrick swings her into the air twirls her around and around as we over slow music possible theme song sara in a gown and patrick in a tux
dancing as if they had danced from the last frame into this one
they are beautiful
wider to reveal the entire dance floor
and we see that its the senior prom
the rooms dressed up like a dreamy futuristic romantic illusion
the ceilings ablaze with tiny star like lights under them large poufs of cotton clouds hang
glittering mirrored balls dangle over the main floor
seniors dance in traditional and cutting edge tuxes and mouth watering eye popping versions of dresses and gowns
camera pans the floor picking up a surprisingly dashing snookie and the fly girl
as they dance he bravely but rather too abruptly dips her
diggy in a glitter tuxedo and spiked hair and her date
nikki with whom we shall perceive to be the howard university guy
in any event he looks slightly bored
chenille with kenny smiles at sara as she and patrick dance by
camera favors and pushes in on
sara and patrick
gazing at each other
the song ends with them in each others arms
