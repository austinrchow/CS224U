written by michael hogan paul p fix story by gordon ray young close shot station signboard
it reads camera pans to show the dusty platform of a typical small arizona town of the late nineties
camera trucks along platform past a line of sleeping figures consisting of a couple of drunks an indian two mexicans and a mongrel dog
camera stops on the window of the ticket office
inside the office can be glimpsed the station agent dozing in a chair with his feet up against the grill of the ticket window
the clicking of the signal indicator is heard
the agent opens his eyes flips up the indicator and begins to get to his feet sleepily
line of sleeping figures with dog in f
the sound of a distant train whistle is heard o
the dog which up to now might have been dead opens one eye and looks past camera
railway track with the three car train approaching
line of sleeping figures
the dog jumps up barking furiously and runs out of shot past camera
the sleeping figures come to life and look toward camera
at the same time the door of the ticket office opens and the agent appears
the train is now almost at the station
full shot with the line of men now standing on the edge of the platform looking toward camera
train steams slowly in past camera and stops with a tall wide shouldered man of about rocklin dressed in new store clothes cowboots and a broad brimmed white hat in
standing on steps of day coach with a small valise and saddle in his hands
behind rocklin a conductor
the baggageman is standing at the open door of the car with two sacks of mail
he drops them to the platform and waves to the conductor o
and begins to close the doors of the baggage car
on station agent and conductors
the latter signals the engineer
the train whistle sounds again o
and the shadow of the moving train begins to pass across the station agents face
as rocklin comes along the platform carrying the valise in one hand and balancing the saddle on his shoulder with the other a man behind him picks up the two
mail sacks and exits from scene
the station bums look at rocklin curiously
his expression giving no encouragement they slink back out of the sun and begin to settle down in their old places again
at the ticket office rocklin pauses and looks around uncertainly
at office door expectin someone
after a seconds pause i guess not
wheres the stagecoach office
pointing back of the depot
the stage is drawn up in front of the depot over which is a sign j
harolday proprietor rocklin making his way along the walk almost reaches the depot when his attention is arrested by the sight of dave the stage driver who has just rounded
in front of the lead horses
he pauses close to one horses head
rocklin sees dave take a bottle from his person uncork it as he glances around and raise it to drink
the bottle is almost to daves lips when the horse shies swinging its head
the bottle is knocked from the old fellows hands and smashes on the ground
now rocklin witnesses a scene of intense fury which he finds amusing despite its seriousness
old dave rants and snorts beats his thighs his heads flings his arms wildly and exhibits his utter disgust generally
to horse consarn you blossom lookit that jus lookit what you done some more pantomime im tellin you blossom that indicating broken bottle makes you the most aggravatin female as
ever i had a despise fer ive got a good notion to pizen you an whats more he stops talking abruptly because his hand has quite by chance felt the spare bottle he carries which he has forgotten in his anger
a most satisfying smile lights his bewhiskered face as he brings the bottle into view
he uncorks it and stepping a few paces from the horse raises the bottle
to blossom heh heh fooled you didnt i
chuckles fooled myself too
who has been watching daves performance
he smiles his amusement and now proceeds toward the stage office
rocklin enters and moves over to the counter behind which is the stage agent a mild looking man with pebble lens glasses
during the scene the character who picked up the mail sacks from the platform comes in dumps the sacks on the counter and leaves
to rocklin howdy
indicating stage that the stage for santa inez
nods leaving any minute
rocklin puts his saddle on the counter and taking out a wad of bills drops them on the counter
the stage agent counts out the fare
santa inez seventeen fifty returning the balance name
the stage agent turns to make out the ticket
rocklin takes some tobacco and paper from his vest pocket as he glances outside
mind if i ride alongside the driver
over his specs its all right with me if its all right with dave hes mad his last trip had a row with harolday the boss old timer dave an
a grumpy old cuss
soberly i like grumpy old cusses hope to live long enough to be one
he shakes his head and hands rocklin the ticket and moves over to the door with one of the mail sacks in his hand
the stage agent carrying a mail sack and rocklin come from the stage depot and reach the stage as dave is in the act of climbing up to the drivers
heres your mail dave dave looks over his shoulder at the agent and steps to the ground as rocklin climbs up to the drivers seat
as he steps up to the seat and a passenger
dave glares at rocklin climbing up to the seat and he is about to order him down when rocklin now seated looks down at him and asks rather wistfully mind
if i ride up here
dave does mind but his better judgment tells him to step carefully in his attitude toward this stranger who does things first then asks permission
his only answer to rocklin is a characteristic grimace which is eloquent enough
and now dave turns on the agent who becomes the target of his pent up wrath
wheres them wimmen
up at the hotel
yanking mail sack from agent why aint they here
this is the stage depot aint it
heaves sack into boot aint it
you can pick em up there its only up the street ony up the street an they caint walk it whats the matter dont easterners have laigs like other folks
dave stalks around the rear of the coach
the agent meantime stretches himself up toward rocklin
so dave wont hear hold tight when you git in the mountains mister when he gits riled you can hear the passengers prayin for miles
dave has climbed to his seat and now the coach lurches away leaving the agent shaking his head dubiously
from the porch of the hotel
we see the stage approaching as the hotel handyman brings a trunk and a couple of bags from the hotel to the street
the coach pulls up and stops
to handyman whars them wimmen
they waitin for you to carry em out
before the handyman can answer daves attention is taken by someone calling his name from across the street
meantime an indian squaw wobbles from the hotel with bow and arrow etc
rocklin buys bow and arrow
as he comes to dave dave dave tell arly harolday her saddle aint ready yet will ya
getting to the ground i aint tellin that crazy female nothin last time i seen her she threatened to rip the hide offn me and bat me dizzy with it
dave goes to the rear of the coach
looks up to rocklin mister will you tell the agent at santa inez to tell miss harolday her saddle aint ready yet
nods ill say that
miss martin steps out onto the porch followed by clara and a gentleman presumably the hotel manager or clerk
the women are obviously easterners and are attired in the good taste of the period
miss martin is a domineering woman approaching middle age
her niece clara is a well bred attractive girl of twenty one and completely under the influence of the older woman
as group comes through door by next year madam we expect to have a bathtub on each floor
miss martin stops short and looks o
having a time lifting the trunk up into the boot
miss martin and the others come into the scene
now dont drop it dave pauses to see who is talking
at your age youd best not be lifting things so heavy
grimaces mebbe youre young enough to hoist her up your own self
tries to lift trunk again on clara
she is looking rather timidly up at rocklin
he is grinning appreciatively at old dave
now he notices clara and regards her soberly a moment
dave has heaved the trunk in place and is securing it
miss martin about to enter the coach notices clara staring up at rocklin
clara snaps her attention from rocklin to her aunt
the clerk steps to the side of the coach and opens the door
he assists clara inside and now miss martin
miss martin and clara
miss martin is just sitting
she looks coldly at clara
in low voice staring as though youd never seen a man before
dave rocklin and clerk
dave is at the moment climbing to his seat on the other side of the coach
the clerk swings the door closed and looks up to rocklin and speaks more or less confidentially
try to hold him down or hell scare the women to death
he is looking down at the clerk and answers quite casually but loud enough to be heard by the women
i never feel sorry for anything that happens to a woman
through window of door miss martin and clara
the women have obviously overheard rocklins remark
miss martin smiles vindictively at clara who flushes
camera pulls back to include the clerk who moves to the coach door
well i hope you have a nice trip ladies
i hope we get there wouldnt surprise me if we didnt
on dave and rocklin
mutters wait till i get you on the road you old buzzard youll be surprised all right
he takes up the reins and shouts the team away
extreme long shot with the stage hardly more than a black dot below its curl of rising dust in the midst of the whole broad expanse
as the coach disappears from shot the two mounted men appear riding at an easy pace and continue in the same direction as the coach
close shot dave and rocklin the latter staring straight ahead
as they roll with the roll of the coach dave steals a look at his companion
i wonder why a young feller who dont have to wants to come into this god danged country
rocklin ignores daves question and continues staring ahead
dave glances down toward the women
say did you mean what you said back there about wimmen
grimly every word of it
chuckling then youre smarter than most
maybe i seen more of em than most
looking at him admiringly shouldnt be surprised
shouldnt be a leetle bit surprised
reflectively all the same
he breaks off and chuckles again
unsmilingly all the same what
dave doesnt reply but lifting the pint of whiskey jerks out the cork with one movement of his thumbnail
offering bottle to rocklin take a slug
rocklin drinks and gives the bottle back to dave who all but empties it in one pull
holding up the bottle and squinting through it whiskey and wimmen ever think how much alike they are
both fool you but you never figger out how to do without em
rocklin makes no reply
dave offers the bottle again
not just yet
putting the bottle to his lips heres to her
the next one that fools you
he empties the bottle and shies it away
at the same time the coach hits a particularly bad patch of road and there is muffled exclamation from inside the coach
dave leans over and looks down o
close shot clara and miss martin
the former is showing the effects of the rough ride but the old lady is hanging on grimly
dave straightens up grinning
with relish mighty rough stretch along here
he whips up the team at the same time weaving a little unsteadily in his seat
like me to speel you a while
ive had a few snorts but that dont make no difference
leasways never has
after a seconds pause dont ever git wore out and useless like me
whore them as say you are
harolday for one
oh i aint belly aching
reckon hes entitled to his opinion
but him and me never did see eye to eye
its constitootional i reckon
like that step daughter of his is crazy hes too sane
believes in law and order
grinning whats wrong with law and order
depends on whos a dishin it out
never was good at takin orders meself
as for the law well youll soon find out what that means round these parts
the coach hits a particularly bad bit of road and there is an exclamation from inside
dave grins and urges the team on cheerfully
full shot as dave pulls up the stage at the top of a long downgrade and looks out appreciatively at the view
from this crest of the rim a vast expanse of country is visible
miss martin thrusts her head out of the window
driver whats the matter
git out and stretch yore laigs if you want
i can see with my own eyes its downhill
dave brightens visibly at this challenge
you in such an all fired hurry lady
certainly we are in a hurry
beaming well well hurry some
his whip cracks like a rifle shot and the startled horses literally jerk the heavy stage over the rim and down the grade
grade with the stagecoach bounding and reeling down the narrow road and around the sharp bends
dave and rocklin on stage as it thunders downhill
dave is leaning out and listening hopefully for the outcries from within
rocklin is hanging on with both hands and mildly amused
the two women are really being scrambled
close two shot dave and rocklin
rocklin is as calm as if he were walking
dave is more and more pleased with himself
he again leans out to listen
grade with coach approaching in b
the road narrows and makes a sharp turn at the very edge of a precipice
there is no possible way of getting the coach safely around this turn except at a walk
road from point of view of drivers seat establishing the same menace ahead
dave and rocklin as rocklin glances out of the corner of his eyes as if wondering whether or not dave is too drunk to perceive the disaster
he makes no move however to advise or interfere
road at danger corner as stage comes in
at the very last second dave pulls in the horses and negotiates the turn in safety
dave grins at rocklin then listens for the outcry he expects from the women within
the old ladys head bobs out of the window
fiercely now whats the matter
why are we stopping again
old daves mouth drops open and as rocklin begins to grin at his discomfiture
full shot of lonely adobe which serves as a combination roadhouse stage station and bar
as the coach rolls into f
a little mexican boy pablo runs out to change the horses
as rocklin swings down buenas noches senor
buenas noches amigo
grinning at the friendly tone ha llegado anticipademente senor
tuvimos suerte en haber llegado
he glances pointedly at dave who is climbing down unsteadily and pablo bursts out laughing
on door of coach
as dave comes into shot miss martins head pops out of the window
gruffly we stop here
why do we stop here
if you wanta eat and stretch yore laigs
will you please stop referring to my legs
you got some aint you
he turns and lurches toward the roadhouse
full shot from doorway
it is a large barn like room on one side of which is a bar
on the other side is a fireplace and a partition behind which is a rough dining table and benches
standing at the bar drinking with his back to the door is a wizened little man dressed in an odd assortment of ragged garments of unrecognizable origin
on the counter is a travelling prospectors pack to which is strapped an assortment of prospectors equipment including a pick and shovel
as dave enters the man zeke turns around and reveals a face even hairier than daves
holding out his arms dave
letting out a yell and rushing to zeke why zeke you two legged old coot
zeke and dave as they beat one another on the back
whar you been all these months
up in the hills workin my way down the biggest hole you ever seed
good whats at the bottom of it
roaring with laughter what again
rocklin has entered and moved to the fire
miss martin and clara enter and stand in the doorway watching the scene at the bar
a pale faced dyspeptic looking man of about stan comes from the kitchen and approaches them ingratiatingly
good evening ladies
how about something to eat
with a dubious look toward the pair at the bar well if it wont take too long
leading the way toward the partition this way ladies
dave has just fitted a cylindrical record of she was only a bird in a gilded cage to an old type phonograph
yep this is my last trip
old harolday wont take back what he said
whatd he say
they both yell with laughter and slap one another on the back
rocklin is standing in f
looking down at the fire and making the inevitable cigarette from his pocket dip
seated at the table are clara and miss martin
comes the sound of zeke and dave singing to the phonograph record
miss martin glares indignantly in the direction of the bar obviously about to make a protest
at this moment stan comes from the kitchen with a large dish in his hand which he dumps on the table
there you are folks
dig in and help yrselves
miss martin sitting forward eagerly suddenly sees the dish of meat and freezes
dish of meat
it is swimming in greasy brown gravy
miss martin as she shudders dyspeptically and closes her eyes
bar as stan comes from the table to dave and zeke
noisily im drinkin mine
set em up
clara has filled a plate with food which she offers to her aunt
auntie with my dyspepsia
do you want to kill me
clara hesitates for a second then looks across to rocklin
arent you going to have any supper
he comes to table and begins to help himself
there is a loud burst of laughter from the bar
young man that drivers had all the liquor he can take
you know he has
youre not a complete fool are you
to clara furiously the rudeness of people in these parts is appalling
clara looks apologetically at rocklin then away again nervously
suddenly she sees something o
and drops her knife and fork with a little start
a thin unpleasant looking face is seen through the glass
the windowpane is defective and so distorts the lower part of the face into a hideous smile
it is the younger of the two men who were watching the coach outside the hotel
on kitchen door as stan comes through with a dish of potatoes
a mans voice is heard o
and he pulls up abruptly
well well smells like a mighty nice bit of veal
camera has panned to include the side door next to the window and almost opposite to the dining table
the owner of the face at the window bob clews is now standing in the doorway
behind him is the man with the sheriffs badge on his dirty vest jackson
as they come forward toward stan the latter shows obvious signs of nervousness
doin yourself well these days stan
a friend of mine was by an sold me a quarter of beef
insinuatingly the same friend as sold you that hide bob here found stashed in your barn yesterday
hide what hide
the one that might send you to the penitentiary
smugly what did you do with it stan
i never had no hide stashed harshly i saw it yesterday under the hay
then it must still be there
no it aint we looked where is it
i tell ya who has been an interested witness what is all this
jackson as though noticing the women for the first time raises his hat
miz caldwell aint it
no martin miss martin this is miss caldwell
to clara glad to know you miss been expectin you at santa inez
im sheriff jackson
any relation of red caldwells a friend of mine
that oily smile youre sure gonna brighten things up considerable around the k
miss martin gives clews an icy stare and snaps her eyes to jackson
indicating stan whats going on with him
just a little matter of the law
rustlin cattle stealin
oh a thief visibly worried i tell ya i never quickly save it to miss martin matter of fact bob here says that the hide he saw yesterday had the
brand on it
oh hmmm well what do you intend doing about it
looking at stan laws pretty harsh round here on cattle thieves
being the kind man course we dont want to make a mistake with an old timer but rocklin speaks from where he leans against the wall casually smoking
how about the owner of that beef mightnt he have somethin to say about it
theres a pause in which all have turned their attention to rocklin
red caldwell hes the owner of the k
after a short chuckle youre way behind the herd mister red caldwell died three weeks ago
glaring at clews was murdered you mean
thats right shot in the back not far from here
significantly to stan maybe he was gettin on to things about the cattle thats been missin from the k
i tell ya i aint never had any hide quickly well you got beef meekly defiant yes an i got a bill of sale fer it too
jackson and clews exchange a quick glance
spose you let me see that bill of sale
starts for kitchen its right out here
jackson follows looking at the women
like i said i wouldnt want to make a mistake with an ole timer
jackson follows stan into the kitchen
clews moves to the fire and lunges there picking his teeth and eyeing clara who stirs uneasily under the mans gaze
as rocklin comes out of the thoughtful mood in which he has been plunged by the information about red caldwell and notes the by play between clews and clara
he frowns and makes a movement as if about to rise
at the same time dave and zeke whose voices have been heard throughout in the b
stagger into the shot
chuckling and pointing to miss martin see that one
confidentially she aint got no laigs
hold your tongue
to zeke who is gaping at her and you stop staring as if we were monsters
zeke takes it and staggers into the b
near bob clews
to rocklin wheres stan
we got to have another drink
hes outside tryin to explain away a hide
indicating food seems were eatin stolen beef
stan might have given house room to bit o dead beef but hed never be fool enough to leave the hide lyin around
to zeke how bout it zeke
zeke opens his mouth to speak and slowly folds up sliding down the wall to the floor
as clews comes from the fireplace and joins the group
thats the way it is dave
dave has gone to zekes aid and now peers at clews closely recognizing him for the first time
disgustedly oh its you
thats right your old pal bob clews
shoves clews git away from me you two timin horse thief
grinning thems fightin words pardner
stan and jackson come from the kitchen
dave is again picking up zeke but seeing stan lets zeke drop
moving to stan hey stan dont let em hang nothin on you you aint done
theyre just a couple of fourflushers the pair of em everybody knows that
jackson addresses everyone present with an indulgent smile
wheels on jackson mebbe i am drunk mebbe thats why im tellin the truth im drunk an ill say what i think ill say what i know
zeke on the floor takes up daves belligerent mood for a flash
so will i goes out again jackson goes to dave
dont act up this ways dave theys women watchin
clews moves in to jackson and dave and now both men urge dave toward the door
attempting to throw them off git your hands off me to company in general what he needs is a short lay down
taking a step forward ill lend a hand
brushing past him me an bobll look after him
were his friends come on bob
as they steer dave through door careful now dont hurt him
rocklin stands frowning a second then turns toward the table where stan is making a show of clearing dishes etc
quietly to stan how are things standin now between you an the law
indicates direction jackson went out not wanting to talk about it particularly all right i reckon looks at rocklin more confidently i guess this bill of sale indicates it in
vest pocket kinda winded him
rocklins lips curl in a wise smile
good thing you saved it
zeke is discovered on all fours crawling around on the floor near the table where the women sit
he seems to be looking for something
mystified what are you doing
zeke turns his hairy face up toward miss martin
musta been dreamin thought i was sittin on a pot of gold
wearily there aint no gold here
takes it there aint even a pot
the door leading from the barn opens and jackson enters followed by clews a few steps behind
how is he
went to sleep soons we laid him down
pulling off hat again sorry to have a ruckus in front of you ladies
daves an ornery old cuss when he gets goin no shape to drive on im afraid
this is a fine kettle of fish hmmm dont worry maam
bob here ll take you on in knows every inch of the road dont you
grins you bet
rocklin has been listening intently
of the group with clews looking significantly at jackson who is obviously checkmated by rocklins remark
finally speaks but if anything was to happen to the ladies id feel to blame
he turns abruptly and walks out the front door to the coach
jackson stares after him a moment uncertain
now he turns to the women
you ladies want he should drive
miss martin hesitates
ill be moren glad to accommodate you smiles at clara resenting clews familiarity hes going with us anyway he may as well drive
anything you say maam
shot coach as rocklin moves toward it from the house
a crudely made arrow shoots in and hits rocklin lightly
a warning hiss is heard o
and he turns quickly in the direction of the sound
shot door of stable
the little mexican who attended the horses is peering out from the stable
in a whisper venga con migo senor
the kid disappears inside the stable
rocklin comes into shot from the direction of the coach and enters the stable
rocklin comes through the door and moves toward the boy who is standing looking downward into some hay
camera pans down to show dave unconscious with a nasty cut in his scalp
rocklin kneels into the shot
over the scene comes the sound of retreating hoofbeats
long shot from rocklins angle in the stable of jackson and bob clews riding away
to boy did they do it
nods si senor
they hit him with a pistola
matters his friends eh
he kneels again picks dave up and prepares to carry him out
long shot of stagecoach traveling
rocklin on the drivers seat handling the reins expertly
panning shot with miss martin and clara now seated next to one another
clara is half asleep with her head against the side of the coach
miss martin is sitting bolt upright but her eyes are closed and her head nods
camera pans to include the other side of the coach where dave is sprawled in the seat his head on a cushion his mouth open sound asleep
suddenly he snores violently and miss martin wakes with a start and glares at him angrily
panning shot on sign on window which reads proprietor j
harolday camera pans to show the coach pulled up outside with rocklin lifting his saddle from the top of the coach whilst a stableman holds up dave
bumped his head
skeptically where on iron mountain
wheres the best chance of a cheap room
pointing theres caps place across the street the sun up saloon
with valise indicates saddle ill pick that up later
group to include the window of the coach
miss martins head appears
to stableman this isnt the hotel
hotels up the street a piece
are we expected to carry our bags at this time of night
to rocklin want to drive em on up
offering a shoulder to dave here catch aholt
the two move out of shot across the road followed by the indignant gaze of miss martin
panning shot opening on the sign over the door which reads camera pans to show rocklin and dave coming along the boardwalk in front of the saloon
camera pans them to the swing doors which rocklin pushes open passing through into the saloon
panning shot shooting from behind the bar toward the swing doors as dave and rocklin enter
the bartender cap a lean tallish man of about studies them as they enter then turns and calls across the room
camera pans to show a group of poker players seated around a table
this consists of a well dressed powerful looking man of about judge garvey with a smooth face and an impressive manner a flashily dressed young man with a weak face
clint harolday a tough looking cowboy of about ab jenkins a pleasant faced storekeeper of about pap fossler and a little man with a weather beaten face and intensely blue eyes doc riding
watching the game are sam haynes and shorty davis the former a townsman and the latter a cowboy
as they all look toward the door caps voice continues
customer doc riding looks quickly toward the door taking in the situation
to haynes take my hand sammy
rocklin and dave come to the bar
at the same time doc riding comes into shot from the poker table
bumped his head
dryly i see
examining the head looks like hes going to need a couple or so stitches
to cap better get him upstairs
the bartender looks dubious
you can book me a room too
as rocklin and doc riding begin to lead dave toward the stairs
trucking shot starting on big head of dave as he lies in bed with his eyes closed
his head is swathed in a clean bandage
he stirs and gives a little chuckle
muttering no laigs
camera pulls back to show doc riding at the bed and rocklin beyond standing in the connecting doorway between two bedrooms
the latter has a face towel in his hands and has evidently been washing up
as dave settles down comfortably in the bed doc riding closes his bag nods to rocklin and moves toward the second bedroom
close shot as doc riding comes through the doorway from daves room
hell be all right in the morning
rocklin closes door behind him
how about a snort
dont mind if i do
he moves across the room followed by rocklin who throws the towel down on the bed as he passes
for a second he hesitates as if about to pick up the gun belt which is lying on the bed
then deciding to leave it he follows the doctor through the door
close shot at bar with cap setting up glasses for doc riding and rocklin
he nods to indicate the bedroom upstairs
with a grin will he make it
sure hell make it
cant kill off a salty old hairpin like dave that easy

to rocklin by the way how did you say it happened

casually reason i ask is a couple fellers was in saying how dave was kickin up a ruckus up at stans place
to doc riding sheriff jackson it was and one of the clewses
with a look of distaste oh
cap reverts to rocklin still casually but with an undertone of friendly warning
tough customers the clewses
yeah dont pay to start something with em you dont intend to finish
to doc riding before rocklin can answer by the way doc they tell me georgell be out again
to rocklin with the same casual air thats bob clews brother

muttering into his drink pity they didnt string him up while they wore about it
thats what arly harolday was sayin only this mornin

chuckles hell fire in skirts
raises his glass grinning well heres now

there is a burst of excited comment from o
and they all look around toward the poker table
poker table from bar
the flashily dressed youngster is raking in the stakes triumphantly
what did i tell you
they gotta be big to beat me
group at bar
clint haroldays in luck tonight

besides i ony came in to oblige
turning to bar and shouting come on doc
i still got to take something from you
shaking his head no more tonight son
ive a full day ahead
judge garvey in foreground has been watching rocklin as if trying to sum him up
he now leans forward with an ingratiating smile
how about you sir
care to sit in
im warnin you though our young friend here has been holding phenomenal cards
rocklin smiles and begins to shake his head
with a cocky grin have a heart judge
this aint no two bit saddle tramps game
this is for real money
rocklin turns very slowly and stares at clint
the others watch curiously
without taking his eyes off clint he comes forward slowly and stands looking down at him
then unbuttoning the flap of his pocket he takes out the wad of bills and drops it on the table at the same time sinking into the chair vacated by
the tension amongst the onlookers relaxes and clint grins at garvey and winks significantly
oh this is pap fossler shorty davis ab jenkins mr
harolday and my names garvey judge garvey
i didnt get your name
i didnt give it
to pap who is holding the cards deal
shot poker table including cap who is watching
pap fossler is dealing
there is an atmosphere of tension around the table and it is obvious that clint has been losing
as he picks up his cards he is unable to restrain a smile of triumph
rocklin makes a bet
pap fossler and the man next to him fold immediately
raise you twenty
this is more than rocklin has in front of him
quietly table stakes clint
not if he wants to dig
he stares challengingly at rocklin
rocklin takes out a wallet from which he removes a bill and sees the raise
folding no place for me
eagerly one for me
he reaches for it almost before it is dealt and as a result the card a queen falls face up
clint looks at it gleefully snatches it up and puts it in his hand
rocklin watches him impassively
dont you know that queen is dead
i can take it if i want it
sure if you want but youll have to beat my hand with four cards
hotly im playing these mister
rocklin glances inquiringly at the other players
all are dead panned unwilling to interfere
rocklin looks toward cap who stands near him
shaking his head im not settin in
smoothly why dont you split the pot
im not splitting im betting
he shoves all the money in front of him into the pot
are you calling
clint excitedly starts to rake in the pot
he shoves in the money in front of him which is more than clints and in addition takes from his wallet more bills
clint very excited empties his pockets which is not enough
to other players let me have some money speaking for all youre in deep enough clint
disgusted to rocklin ive called for all ive got
spreads out his cards full house
spreads his hand kings up
your third queen is dead
rocklin starts raking in the pot
clint almost hysterical jumps up draws his gun and thrusts it almost into rocklins face
the other players roll away from the line of fire
screaming you mister get away from that table
and get out of here
maybe from now on youll know a full house beats two pairs four flusher
rocklin his hands outspread slowly straightens up rises and backs away
at the foot of the stairs he turns deliberately and walks upstairs
when he disappears from view clint breaks the tension looking from one to the other
no man can run a bluff on me
there is a cold silence
finally he wasnt armed
i dont like to tell men how to play cards unless im settin in but i mebbe ought to have spoken up
directly to clint that queen was dead clint and you know it
arrogantly when anybody plays poker with me they play my game or not at all
you cant just go makin your own rules clint starts for the bar stops and turns an if i was you id hightail outa here before he comes back
jolted comes back
wearily hes the kind
cap turns and resumes his trek to the bar
suddenly he stops before reaching it and is looking up o
rocklin is standing there grimly surveying the situation
as he starts down the stairs
they are staring o
clint is very uneasy
and now rocklin moves slowly into the scene
with deadly calm ive come for my money
nervously pleasant its all yours mister cap there cap is an old gambler he says you were right all the time
clint again looks around for approval but gets no response
rocklin comes slowly forward picks up the money from the table and turns back to the stairs
as he reaches the foot of the stairs he turns and looks straight at garvey with a peculiar expression
by the way judge the name is rocklin
trucking shot on a small cracked mirror in which can be seen the reflection of a man shaving
a voice is heard singing atrociously off key
she was only a bird in a gilded cage
camera pulls back to show that the owner of tie voice is rocklin who has almost finished shaving
as he scrapes his chin and whistles peering at himself in the little cracked mirror he hears the sound of the door opening and turns then ducks quickly as a
boot flies past him just missing the mirror
there is the sound of the door slamming and rocklin grins
he picks up the boot and goes to the door leading to daves room
as rocklin enters dave is discovered almost dressed sitting on the bed
rocklin glad to see him smiles and tosses the boot to him
how you feelin
after that singin
pulls on his boot hows your head
evidently not aware of what happened oh a mite hungover but ill feel better once i git downstairs
he hurries out the hall door
rocklin amused at the old coot starts back into his room
rocklin is just coming through the door and sees something o
stops and freezes
camera pulls back to include bob clews leaning against the open ball door leading into rocklins room
he smiles as rocklin sees him
i knocked but guess you didnt hear me
closing door to daves room what do you want
grinning looks like you stirred things up around here last night stranger
that all you came to say
i got a message for you
getting no response from old man harolday
wants to see you out front
maybe he wants to thank you for teaching that pup of his a lesson
after a second ill be down
clews hesitates for a second as if anxious to wake sure he is coming then turning he disappears into the hall
rocklin wipes the last of the lather off his chin buckles on his gun belt and picking up his hat goes out closing the door
shot dave at the bar grabbing a bottle pours himself a drink which he sinks in one draught
he shudders and repeats the dose
during this an excited murmur of voices has been heard o
dave turns and looks toward the far side of the saloon and suddenly gapes
with dave in f
and shooting toward the street
a group of men including cap the bartender is gathered round the window looking out into the street
dave staggers across to them and begins to push his way to the window
group at window as dave pushes them aside to get a view of what is happening outside
whats goin on here
arly haroldays on the warpath
panning shot including arly and juan mounted in front of the stagecoach office which is situated diagonally across the street from the sun up
camera holds on one group standing in front of pap fosslers store opposite the sun up
here he comes
watch the fun
this should be good
on the window
the men inside including dave and cap are pressed against the glass
camera moves back and pans to the alleyway at the side of the saloon
rocklin is coming toward the street
rocklin as he comes out of the shadow of the alleyway and stands blinking in the full sunlight
sensing something unusual he looks quickly around
from rocklins angle
camera pans over the groups in the street stopping on one which includes bob clews
as clews sees rocklin he nudges a bystander and looks toward the stagecoach office with a grin
camera pans to include arly and juan
rocklin as he takes in the situation
with a grim look he begins to move along the sidewalk camera trucking with him
suddenly there is the clatter of a horses hooves and arly gallops into shot forcing the mare up onto the sidewalk and barring rocklins progress
imperiously is your name rocklin
contemptuously i want that money you took from my brother last night
quietly are you crazy
or just ignorant
flaming you took it at the point of a gun suddenly whipping a revolver from her saddle holster and im taking it back the same way
of group at window of sun up saloon
of group including bob clews as clint harolday rides in and stares o
rocklin as he looks coldly from arly to the run and back again
calmly taking the reins he forces the mares head up and moves on
furiously arly spurs the mare alongside camera trucking with them
stop or ill kill you
arly and rocklin
rocklin continues along the sidewalk
pulls up her horse turn around
she raises her gun
a shot comes from o
and strikes the building close to him
he stiffens but keeps on walking
another shot comes even closer this time
he keeps walking
as he puts out his hand to push open the door rocklins hand on the door as four shots in quick succession spatter a line down the door close to
trucking shot rocklin as he continues his forward movement through the swing doors
camera pulls back in front of him into the saloon until it reaches the bar
cap moves from window with crowd and goes behind bar
close shot arley with the smoking gun still in her hand
she stares wildly after rocklin for a second then wheels her horse violently toward the group which includes cling harolday and bob clews
group surrounding clews and clint harolday
the clatter of hoofs is heard and arly gallops furiously into shot
you lied to me didnt you
dont think ill forget this
making a fool of me in front of the whole town
before clint can reply she wheels the mare and gallops out of shot
shot as the customers with dave in f
mill around rocklin
boy oh boy was that a near thing
shed just as soon have hit you as missed
you dont know how lucky you were son
indicating whiskey with a sickly grin why dyou think i need this
he sinks the whiskey and begins to pour himself another
at the same time the swing doors open and bob clews comes through
as rocklin raises the glass to his lips bob clews hits him on the back causing him to spill the whisky
funniest sight i ever seen
there is a moments pause
then with a slow grim smile of satisfaction rocklin turns and knocks bob clews off his feet
with bob clews on the floor tugging at his gun
as it comes free of the holster rocklin brings his heel down on clews wrist grinding on it with his whole weights
then kicking the gun out of reach rocklin steps back
bob clews sits up clutching his wrist and weaving back and forth
moaning you broke it
you broke it
try another trick like that on me and itll be worse
i never played you no trick
you broke my wrist
to include the bystanders
they look at bob clews without sympathy
he gets to his feet and stumbles back collapsing in a chair
at bar dave has taken the bottle from cap and is refilling rocklins and his own glass ecstatically
gurgling with delight oh boy has somebody come to town
he sinks both drinks quickly and is about to refill them when cap takes the bottle from him
to cap wherell i find judge garvey
he rooms behind his office down the street
dont usually pull up the blinds till around noon though
putting down money he will this morning
to dave see you later old timer
as he moves toward the door
clint harolday is seen at the window peering furtively toward the sun up saloon
he suddenly notices something o
which prompts him to say something which we of course cannot hear
now garvey appears at the window
rocklin from garveys angle as he leaves the sun up and starts toward the judges office
garvey and clint at the window
from their expressions it is apparent that anxious words are passing between them and now clint suddenly drops from sight
on arly and juan mounted
they see rocklin going into garveys place
shot toward door with garvey at desk in f
the door opens and rocklin enters
effusively oh come in mr
come right in
rocklin looks him over for a second then comes quietly to the desk
i understand you were red caldwells lawyer
immediately on guard i was
know anything about this
he takes out a letter and hands it to garvey
the latter takes it slowly handling it as if it were dangerous
he looks from the letter to rocklin and back again
then reluctantly he opens it and begins to read
letter it reads dear mr
rocklin glad you have made up your mind to take the job
enclosed find train fare and advance on wages
yours faithfully j
caldwell rocklin and garvey
the latter looks up from the letter completely bewildered
i dont understand
gaping on the k
trying to take it in but but why should he want you
good foremen dont grow on bushes
there is a little pause with garvey still bewildered
thinking hard is that your only motive for coming here
what other motive could i have
i dont know its just that red caldwell was a peculiar man had a funny way of doing things
he studies rocklin a short moment then sits back comfortably and relieved
well im sorry mr
rocklin that youve been brought all this way on a fools errand but im afraid the deals off
i dont want to be too hard on you but as executor of the estate i have to consider the interests of the new owner
how about say a hundred in full settlement
thoughtfully well there is a knock on the door
garvey rises and speaks on his way to the door
thats my last word think it over
garvey opens the door and miss martin stalks in followed by clare
graciously how do you do ladies icily you are judge garvey i presume
nods yes and you are miss martin and my niece clara caldwell
reaching for a chair of course of course miss martin sits stiffly as she eyes rocklin coldly
you came at a very opportune moment madam
this gentleman claims to have some sort of a letter from the late mr
caldwell engaging him as foreman of the k
to garvey what do you mean claims to have
you saw it didnt you
before garvey can answer you cant hold us to account for every promise made by that man
everyone knows he wasnt responsible for his actions half the time
and if you think id have you as a foreman finds it hard to control himself listen lady id rather walk for somebody else than ride for you
taken aback well the impudence all i come for this morning was to pay beck the hundred and fifty red caldwell sent in advance
oh no they all turn and stare at her
dont interfere clara
of course he must pay it back
the railway fare well i reckon we can check that up against the time lost and call it quits
throws down a roll of bills in front of garvey summoning up her courage but mr
er i dont know your name
raising his hat rocklin miss
rocklin it isnt fair for you to pay anything back
thats how id prefer it if you dont mind miss never did care fer owing favors to no one especially women
as if she had been struck oh
the sound of rapid steps approaching from outside is heard and they all look toward the door
on door as it opens to admit arly
ignoring everyone in the room except garvey she comes abruptly to the desk with the riding quirt dangling from her wrist
ive just heard they let george clews out of penitentiary and that hes headed this way
you might tell him from me if he sets foot on the santee ranch ill shoot him on sight
but really miss arly why should you deliver your message through me
you have mutual friends
if youre referring to sheriff jackson
but thats absurd
the fact that he employs one of the clews brothers doesnt make the other his friend
contemptuously have it your own way but itd be fair to warn him because i mean it
for the first time she appears to be conscious of the presence of the other women
hastening to change the conversation oh miss caldwell this is miss harolday miss martin miss caldwells aunt
you should know one another seeing youll be neighbors
miss harolday runs the santee ranch for her stepfather
shes a famous ah horsewoman in these parts
with ingenuous enthusiasm i know
i saw you ride into town this morning
you looked lovely
just what id like to be
arly stares at her unbelievingly for a second
slowly a bit flustered yes
she looks slowly from clara to rocklin as if suspecting collusion
completely innocent oh this is mr
he drove us in from garden city last night
dead pan i already met miss harolday
stonily to rocklin ive a message for you from harolday
murmuring what again
he wants you to come down to the office
hes got a proposition to make about riding for him
sixty a month
hmmm thats a foremans wages
suddenly exploding i wouldnt offer you a red cent
controlling herself but its his money
bitingly and the way things are shaping maybe we could do with somebody as mean as you around the ranch
pushing her way forward i warn you youre making a great mistake
this man is no good
to rocklin ignoring miss martin well
dyou want the job
rocklin as he stares at arly with an enigmatic expression
suddenly he seems to make up his mind
indicating the door lead the way
as arly turns abruptly on her heel and exits the way she came
rocklin makes a little gesture to the ladies with his hat and follows
as he goes juan who has been leaning against the doorpost follows closing the door behind him
after they have gone auntie why did you have to say that
i simply dont understand you
cutting in grimly but i understand you
scathingly id be ashamed of myself
throwing myself at a man like that
suddenly bursting into tears oh youre horrid horrid
i wish id never come
she turns abruptly and drops onto the couch by the window
camera pans to hold a close two shot of garvey and miss martin
you must excuse her
garvey leans back in his chair and smiles
significantly and young people must be protected from themselves at times dont you agree
miss martin throws him a quick look which he returns steadily
at last with a grim echo of a smile exactly
arly and rocklin walking along the street not far from haroldays office
rocklin glances back toward julio who is following a few paces behind them
he rides his horse and is leading arlys
to arly indicating julio does he always follow you
defiantly hes not following me hes with me hes always with me
takes it mildly oh just an old indian friend
straight at him the best friend ive got
rocklin nods looks back again at julio then back to arly as they go out of shot
paining shot as arly comes to from the street followed by julio and rocklin
abruptly to rocklin wait here
camera pans her over to a door marked private which she opens without knocking
shot as arly comes through from the outer office toward harolday who is seated at desk in f
at arlys abrupt entrance he looks up startled
ive just hired a man named rocklin and said you made me do it
sixty dollars and he ll earn it while he lasts
there is a little pause
haroldays face is completely dead pan
he looks out of the window for a second then back at arly
quietly why did you do it arly
so i can fire him
i hate him
clint and he quarrelled last night
clint lied about it and i made a fool of myself
nodding toward the outer office hes outside now
with a little sigh all right
send him in
arly goes to the door and opens it
calling come in
rocklin comes in and arly exits without a word closing the door behind her
as rocklin comes from the doorway into f
of shot facing harolday who is seated on the far side of the desk
rocklin what happened between you and my son last night
about this suggestion of you working for me
its your suggestion not mine
sixty dollars is big money
turning to go if youve changed your mind
wait a minute
i take it youve had the experience
enough for red caldwell to hire me as foreman
oh had caldwell hired you
yeah but i wont ride for the new owners so that leaves me open
i see were you a friend of reds
no i guess he just heard about me
a sudden clatter of feet is heard and all eyes turn toward the door
as dave followed by arly and juan bursts in
his eyes go around the room quickly until he finds rocklin
as excited as a schoolboy george clews is in town
hes seen what you done to bob and hes a lookin for you
they all look quickly toward the window
long shot from stagecoach office window
the center of the street is clear and mens heads are peering from doorways
shot group at window looking into street
the street is clear
dave turns and looks curiously at rocklin who frowns impatiently
to dave irritably tell him ill be out in the street in front of the saloon
dashing out radiant uh huh
the place is quite full and the atmosphere is one of expectancy despite the outward casualness of the patrons
a group lolls near the window looking toward the stage office
at the door a couple of customers peer out over the swinging doors
the bar supports other customers engaged in various private conversations but all are mindful of the presence of george clews who with his brother bob stands at the bars center
morosely toying with a glass of whisky in front of him
he is quite conscious of the subtle glances of the others but regards them all with disdain
he downs his drink and speaks his thought to bob
im gonna get his ears
suddenly old dave appears in a high state of excitement and halts with the swinging doors half open
loudly hi you george clews george clews turns
rocklin says if you dont come out hell come in here after you an tear you apart
george clews frowns
his eye catches sight of a king size glass of beer being slid across the bar to shorty davis standing alongside him
that quick clews beats shorty to the glass and hurls it at dave who ducks out
cap anticipating trouble brings a sawed off shotgun up from under the bar and now watches clews and shorty
taps clews that was my beer you know
nastily if he comes in again ill throw you
before shorty can reply clews yanks his hat down over the little fellows eyes and gives him a backward shove that sends him sprawling into a corner where we leave
him struggling to get his hat off
the crowd resents this but doesnt dare do anything except cap who holds his shotgun in sight
to the clews that does it boys you know where the door is
to bob com mon ill get his ears
not until i get my money george and bob clews are now a few steps from the bar
they have turned as cap spoke and are looking at the shotgun
theres three drinks and a broken beer glass
to bob after a seconds deliberation pay im
george turns and starts for the doors as bob comes back to the bar to settle up
ill get his ears
quietly that rocklinll kill him for sure
as george clews steps outside a mangy mongrel dog basking close by evidently recognizes him and tails it away leaving george blinking at him
rocklin from georges angle
he is walking slowly forward down the middle of the street
george looking baffled by the steady approach
yelling im coming and youd better run
he steps down from the sidewalk into the street and then stands still again
rocklin camera moving with him as he comes slowly and steadily forward
his hands are on his guns but drunk or not he has too much sense to draw too soon
shot harolday watching from behind the window of his office
behind harolday are julio and arly
the latter makes a step as if about to move to the door but julio restrains her
close shot as garvey miss martin and clara watch the scene below garvey and miss martin excitedly and clara in great distress
closer shot men in hotel doorway taut with excitement
rocklin shooting past george whose hands are on his gun butts
rocklins thumbs are hooked in his belt as he continues slowly forward his eyes fixed on georges
quietly draw a gun and ill kill you
george as he stands bewildered and open mouthed
rocklin enters scene suddenly whips out his gun and brings it crashing down alongside georges head
the barrel strikes though the crown of his hat and he goes down like a pole axed steer
close shot group at window
arly gives an involuntary exclamation of pleasure which she instantly checks then she moves abruptly out of shot followed by juan
harolday continues to stare frowningly out of the window
close shot group at window with garvey obviously disapponted miss martin bridling and clara showing obvious relief
shot rocklin and crowd as they swirl around him offering congratulations
dave pushes his way through the crowd and thumps rocklin on the back in wild enthusiasm
at the same time the sound of a horse cantering is heard and jackson comes into shot
to rocklin hey you
whats this you been up to
i just laid a gun barrel over the head of a drunk friend of yours same as you did over daves here yesterday
blustering i dont know what youre talking about
calmly youre a liar
he turns contemptuously and begins to move back towards the stage office completely ignoring jackson who rides alongside blusteringly
now you lookee here young feller
you go on talking that way and youll find yourself in trouble
the crowd which has been following now begins to razz him openly
he turns and glares but without effect
he gives a final shout to rocklin
dont say you aint been warned
pulling his horse around he sets off in a lope up the street
as miss martin comes along the street determinedly followed by clara until she is face to face with rocklin outside the stage office where arly and juan are mounted ready
to move off
ignoring everyone but rocklin i saw you
i saw you strike that poor man
as hard as i could
you ruffian you
clara pulls her sleeve imploringly
let me go
to rocklin i knew the sort you were the moment i set eyes on you
you cant fool me
youre nothing but a common adventurer
she takes clara by the arm and sweeps past them towards the hotel
rocklin looks after them with a grim expression and then up at arly who has been listening intently
she returns his look steadily for a second
then with a mocking smile she wheels the mare and canters out of shot followed by juan
he looks after her for a second then with the same grim look enters haroldays office
harolday is standing at the window looking toward the door having seen rocklin approaching
the door opens and rocklin enters and resumes his conversation as though it were hardly interrupted
now what was that you were sayin about caldwell
you being hired by red caldwell only confirms what id suspected he was getting ready to fight
trying to get information fight
well at least thats my belief
red was no friend of mine
too fond of taking the law into his own hands
but he had my sympathy
hed been harder hit than any of us
and on top of it all he lost his foreman
you mean he quit on him
he was shot in the back with a bullet from the same caliber rifle as got red
got any ideas
no except that the man you just pistol whipped is in on it somewhere
bitterly pity you didnt kill him when you had the chance
rocklin realizes that maybe harolday is trying to throw a curve trying to get him to talk
say it dont sound as if its goin to be too easy for them wimmen at the k
watching him keenly want to go back and work for them
and i aint jumping at this offer o yours either because i dont hold with working for wimmen
quickly oh you mean my step daughter
well dont worry
she wont interfere with you
rocklin i figure weve been losin cattle over a place called table top its the back way into the topaz ranch and the perfect route for rustlers im going to
send you up to the line camp you dont mind working a lone hand do you
measuring i like workin that way
rising and holding out a hand good be ready to move out this afternoon
on dave and pap fossler engaged in conversation in front of paps store
in the b
across the street we carry the entrance to the sun up saloon
in his best sales talk now pap im givin you first call on me services
theys lots of other folks lookin fer a good man too you know
so if you want me you better hurry and speak up because during daves speech rocklin has come from the sun up carrying his valise
he pauses a moment looking around
dave sees him
scuse me pap be right back to find out when i start
he hurries across the street toward rocklin
on rocklin just stepping off the curb
dave comes in to him
whar you off to
im riding for the topaz ranch
they start across the street slowly toward the stage office
have you gone plumb loco
good money sixty a month there aint enough money in this town to make it worth your while to work for that gal
rocklin gives dave a quizzical look which dave mistakes for weakening
when she gits goin she can be meanern a skillet full o snakes
she aint goin to forget the way you made a fool of her today in front of the whole town
be right with you
to rocklin its pizen thats what it is jus plain what you want to hang around this town for anyways
dave and rocklin have reached middle of the street
pap fosslers voice comes again from o
dave reacts with a squint in paps direction
he runs out toward pap but would rather stay with rocklin
the camera follows rocklin across the street to the stage office where see arly and tala sitting on their horses apparently waiting for rocklin
a third horse is standing by with rocklins saddle on it
rocklin upon reaching the front of the stage office pauses a moment to look over the horse carrying his saddle glances up to arly
be right with you
he goes into the stage of office as we long shot as rocklin arly and juan canter along a dirt road over open country with the mountain ranges in the
camera pans to show a buggy on the road ahead approaching a wooded dell where the road divides
of the buggy showing miss martin riding in front beside shorty davis who is driving and clara with her back to the driver facing the oncoming trio
miss martin hears the sound of the approaching horses and looks over her shoulder
arly juan and rocklin with miss martin in f
the latter scowls and looks quickly to her front as the riders draw level with the buggy rocklin coining to the right alongside clara
good afternoon mr
looking at the sky lovely day isnt it
reckon it is pretty nice
so youre moving in on the k
hesitating and throwing a look toward miss martin we el not exactly moving in
with miss martin in f
and shooting over her shoulder to include clara and rocklin
acidly locking straight ahead do you have to discuss our private affairs with every rag tag and bobtail cow person we meet clara
in a low voice auntie
sorry if i butted in maam
jest passing the time oday
we can do very well without it thank you
with a look over her shoulder and youre keeping your lady friend waiting
rocklin looks quickly in the same direction
from rocklins angle with arly and juan at the fork in the road
they are looking back towards the buggy which has taken the lower road to the right of the copse
with arly and juan in f
and the buggy in the distance
rocklin raises his hat to the women in the buggy and canters back to arly who has been watching with a peculiar expression
coldly i thought maybe youd changed your mind again
she looks at him angrily for a second as if about to say something sarcastic
then repressing herself she wheels her horse and canters off along the side of the copse
rocklin throws an amused glance at juan who has been watching with an enigmatic expression
he returns rocklins look with a stern menacing frown
then with a gentle flick of the rein he urges his horse after arly
completely baffled rocklin scratches his head for a second then follows
shot as the three canter up the driveway to a smart looking ranch house
arly dismounts and throws her reins to juan
over her shoulder to rocklin juanll show you the bunkhouse
ill talk to you about your duties in the morning
before rocklin can speak she runs quickly up the steps of the verandah and disappears into the house
leading arlys horse juan moves out of shot to the left of the ranch house and rocklin follows
shot as juan comes into shot leading the mare followed by rocklin
they both dismount and begin to off saddle
how far is the line camp at table top
twenty five thirty mile
im moving out there first thing in the morning
as juan turns and stares boss orders
care to show me the way
there is a moments pause
then what almost amounts to a smile of relief crosses juans face
i will show you
long shot as rocklin and juan ride out from the ranch through the early morning mist and turn off in the direction of the distant line of mountains
long shot as the two leave the open country and enter the mouth of a steep and narrow gorge at the foot of the mountain range
as juan pulls up and dismounts followed by rocklin
pointing ahead the trail is straight ahead
you will find the cabin at the top
turning back to his horse adios senor
challenging but perfectly friendly senor romerez it appears that you do not like me
for a second juan does not reply
then as he speaks he takes a tobacco pouch from his pocket
rocklin his mind on other things does not take particular notice of the pouch but we cannot help notice the pouch ornament a steers head of hammered silver
during the above business senor that is true
i do not like you
extending the pouch permit that i offer you a cigarette
rocklin shakes his head
juan having spilled tobacco in a paper now puts away the pouch and rolls his own
it is not your fault that your shadow is black
but you will only bring unhappiness to my senorita
i do not blame you but i fear i must hate you
he turns abruptly and mounts the waiting horse then looks down from the saddle
he rides quickly out of the shot
shot as rocklin forces his horse up the last few feet of the steep trail at the top of the canyon and pulls up at the top of the rise
with a look of amazement
a rich meadow stretches ahead with a stream running through it and a cabin at the far end
steep escarpments surround the lush meadow land making an idyllic scene
as rocklin comes slowly into shot with the same look of startled appreciation on his face and begins to move toward the cabin long shot of juan as he canters
across open country toward the ranch
camera pans to include the road from santa inez along which approaches a smallish freight wagon pulled by two horses
as the driver sees juan and waves his whip the mexican swerves from his course and canters toward the wagon
wagon which we now see is being driven by dave
on the side of the wagon is written transport general freightage pap fossler and sons
juan canters into shot and pulls up alongside the wagon
buenos dias senor dave
looking at name on wagon you have found new employer eh
haulin freight for ole pap fossler
got a letter here for that crazy galoot rocklin
with a little wink from the little caldwell girl
seems mighty took up about sumpin
made me promise to deliver it personal
indicates letter but senor rocklin is not here
lordy he aint quit already
shakes head i have just accompany him to table top
shelley a negro servant of the harolday household is discovered sweeping the front porch
behind him we see clint open the door peer furtively out then cross the porch to its edge when he looks o
as though searching for someone
shelley meantime has noticed clint but goes right on with his sweeping
his only reaction is a disparaging glance over his shoulder
turning to shelley have you seen arly
no suh ah didnt see miss arly today but ah seed her las night and she shore was mad
to emphasize his point shelley puckers his mouth in a whistle
clints face tightens as he anticipates what is in store for him
over the scene comes the gradually increasing sound of a feminine voice gayly humming the notes of a popular tune of the period
clints strained features relax in a can that be arly expression while shelley stops dead in the middle of a sweep and now both stare incredulously o
from their angle we first see only the corner of the house while the owner of the voice approaches from the other side
now arly comes into view entirely oblivious of clint and shelley watching her
she seems more attractive in a feminine way this morning
it may be the skirt and blouse she is wearing
then again it may be the flower she is even now adjusting in her hair
the presence of the two men suddenly startles her
the song ends abruptly while her hands fall quickly away from the flower
as arly moves toward the porch shelley snaps back to life and resumes sweeping but furiously
clint regards the girl in the vague manner of the puzzled gent he is
not too definitely mornin arly arly is coming toward clint
pleasantly mornin clint
she steps close to clint and he slowly backs up a step for he does not know she came up to him merely to pick up her jacket lying on
the ground near the step
as arly leans down to pick up the jacket you must be feeling pretty good
arly straightens up with the jacket in her hand and the corner of her mouth curls in a faint smile
she turns now and starts along the walk and takes only a few steps when clint comes to her side
as he joins arly say arly about that poker game night before last i tossing it off forget it
did he hear correctly forget it
arly pays no attention to clint
she is looking o
and stops walking
tala on his horse as seen by arly
over the scene comes arlys voice calling from a distance
tala reacts to the call by heading his horse at a slightly different angle
arly is looking o
clint is now eyeing his sister up and down quite openly
she turns her head now and catches clint looking her over
after a stilted pause well with a perplexed smile what is this
a gesture of his hand indicates the way arly has gotten herself up
that quick arlys hand goes to the flower in her hair
and that quick she guiltily withdraws it
bravely nonchalant what do you mean
what do i mean
before he can explain tala pulls up in his horse and we hear his voice over the scene
good morning arliete
tala sitting astride his horse smiles down at the girl
good morning tala
you have make yourself very pretty today
arly is jolted by talas innocent remark and she cant help giving clint a little side glance in the way of reaction
clint has not missed talas crack nor arlys glance and when she gives it to him he says pleasantly see what i mean
he tosses her an altogether knowing look now and leaves going up the walk toward the house
arly turns to tala
have my horse saddled and sent around right away will you
then as a casual afterthought you can have that rocklin bring it
she glances over her shoulder toward clint going up the walk
and then looking back to tala finds he hasnt moved but remains smiling down at her
whats the matter
easily rocklin is not here
breathlessly he quit
he has gone to the line camp at table top
it was mr
arly looks away
her eyes stare blankly into space as she struggles with the mixed emotions of anger and disappointment
tala aware of her plight slowly dismounts and comes to the girls side
in a fatherly manner why do you make your heart heavy with thoughts of him little one
he is not for you
bitterly be quiet
he has made the choice arliete
with your own eyes you saw it yesterday
impatiently oh and she too has opened her heart to him already she has summoned him to her
this turns her around what do you mean
dave of the white beard carries a letter to rocklin it is from her
how do you know that
i have just now met dave and he tell me
so now he rides to table top
arly is quiet a moment
little one you quickly as she starts for the house oh leave me alone
entrance to ranch
entering the driveway from the direction of santa inez comes harolday still looking the distinguished citizen
good morning julio morning arly
to julio as he dismounts fetch my briefcase its on my desk
still smarting under the disappointment about rocklin seems lost in thought
after regarding her a moment harolday speaks
looks like were going to get that land weve been wanting along the river bottom
arly turns her eyes on harolday who continues
i didnt tell you but i bought the mortgage on the hardman ranch and its due today on my way over there now
arlys eyes burn as she tosses her head slightly
did you send that rocklin to table top
furiously well lets get things straight
this place was my mothers now its mine and clints its true youve been helping out but the way things are going well soon be able to pay you back
every penny we owe
meanwhile im running this outfit and i expect to give the orders
you generally do
why did you send rocklin up to table top
it seemed to me a good idea what with all this rustling going on whod ever try driving cattle over table top
unless they were crazy
coldly i dont agree with you
in any case if you must have it id no intention of engaging a man at foremans wages just to gratify the whims of a jealous woman
dangerously you take care what youre saying
very controlled its you should take care my dear
im afraid theres one man you cant rawhide into jumping the way you want
youve made a fool of yourself over him once
better watch out you dont do it again
he turns abruptly and walks off the verandah
as harolday comes from the verandah to his horse
juan is standing there with the briefcase which harolday takes with a yank mounts his horse and rides out
the camera moves in close on arly who stands in furious silence watching harolday ride away
old dave is jogging along in his wagon
a rumble of thunder echoes through the canyon
dave reacts with a look toward the sky
of storm clouds gathering
a night shot of the mountain road near table top
it is a wooded section of the plateau and occasional flashes of lightning illuminate the big trees skirting the road
dave in his wagon looms out of the b
and as he nears the camera we hear him urging the team through the downpour
as he passes and continues hurriedly on his way we close shot on a soiled and wrinkled envelope lying on a table
it is addressed to mr
rocklin c o santee ranch the camera pulls back and rocklin is revealed at the table looking down at the letter
his hat is tipped back on his head and his sleeves are rolled up
he is mixing dough in a bowl sitting on the table near the letter and his hands are all gooey
dave is discovered in front of the fireplace where his outer shirt and socks are drying
it is dark outside but the storm has abated
rocklin goes to a shelf near the fireplace to get a pan
during the above durn funny that storm quittin just about the time i get here
no funnier than you sloggin through it just to deliver a letter from a woman
disgustedly reckon im gettin to be more of a fool the older i get
dave watches rocklin at the table shaping the dough for biscuits and putting it in the pan
when are we gonna get around to readin it
rocklin cannot help smiling a bit at the way dave includes himself in
thought id wait till mornin might be bad news an i wouldnt be able to sleep
dave screws up his face in utter disgust and turns his attention to his drying clothes
rocklin meanwhile takes a flour sack from the table wipes the dough from his hands and picks up the letter
he goes over to the fireplace opening the letter the while and sits on the bench
dave seeing this edges discreetly around in back of rocklin in order to see over his shoulder
the letter open rocklin takes out a roll of bills along with the folded message
he lays the envelope on the bench
rocklin places the money in his shirt pocket for the moment and opens the folded message
it begins with the usual dear mr
rocklins voice is heard over the insert as he reads from here
reading forgive me if this letter is a trifle incoherent but i am terribly worried and unhappy
who wouldnt be livin with that ole screech owl
continues to read i am desperately in need of help and advice from someone whom i feel i can trust and i am appealing to you because i regard you
in the same way my uncle surely must have
i heartily dislike and distrust judge garvey interrupting huh smart girl going on but my aunt seems to have suddenly revised her opinion of him and now wants me to
place all my affairs in the judges hands and return east
such is certainly not my wish
significantly looks kinda like shes formed an attachment
rocklin glares up to dave
quickly for the locality i mean
continues reading i wanted so much to give ranch life a trial but fear circumstances are against me especially in view of the recent indian trouble explosively indian trouble in
normal tone good lord they aint been any indian trouble around here in caustically you want to hear the rest of this
getting the inference mights well come this far
reading i want to apologize for what took place this afternoon
and i am returning the because i feel it is rightfully yours
you must take it
faithfully yours clara caldwell
the letter finished rocklin regards it a moment then slowly returns it to the envelope as he gazes thoughtfully into the fire
dave meantime straightens up scratches his shaggy top and turns his attention once more to his drying clothes
feeling his socks well what do you make of it
rocklin continues looking into the fire as he lays the letter back on the bench and takes out tobacco to roll a cigarette
somebodys sure bustin to get her out of there
dave sits alongside rocklin and begins putting on his socks
indian trouble after a pause wonder why the old ladys playin along
sourly baaa wimmen who can ever figure em
pause got to admit though i feel a mite sorry for the youngun nice little tyke
too nice for this country
after a slight pause shes shore a pretty thing
rocklin has been mulling things over
dont know how i could help her even if i wanted to i dont know any thing about this garvey or caldwell or well now i could mebbe help you
out some there fact i could tell you somethin bout ole red that might be interestin
you must have known him pretty well what kind of a man was he
rocklin goes to the table and resumes molding biscuits
dave has his boots on and is putting on his outer shirt
the best cantankerous cuss but a real cowman believe me he was a big feller like yourself fact you coulda passed fer a blood relation come to think of it
casually as he busies himself with the biscuits was the judge and red friends
anigmatically thats what youd say
garvey managed all reds business
besides which they was regular drinkin pals played poker together most nights tho they do say red got the worst of it
red was a gambler eh
oh yeah reckon a pretty poor one tho still youd say him and garvey was friends
after a side glance to dave anything ever happen to make you think they werent
moves close to rocklin rock im gonna tell you somethin i aint never told anybody
with a slight smile think you can trust me
dave grimaces his confidence
the last time i seen red was the day he died in the pause rocklin remains silent
twas in town he jus come out of the stage office
tried to book passage to garden city but couldnt on account i had a full load
well sir he took me aside and give me a printed sheet of paper and says read it
i looked it over and fer as i could see it was a paper from one of them chicago sportin firms tellin how to manipulate trick playin cards
nods reckon so
seems red found some cards and this paper in a coat one of his friends loaned him one night
whose was it
well now thats just what i asked but all he said was that it belonged to a good friend
then he said he wasnt waitin fer the next coach but was ridin over to see the district judge about it alone
thats when they got him
yes sir bout a mile or so from stans place
a bullet in the back an his pockets empty
how come you never told this before
who was there to tell
him an garveys thick as thieves
how about whats his name harolday
hes no friend of the judges is he
hates his guts sure riles him to see young clint hangin onto the judges coattails
all the same i jus decided to keep my mouth shut and my eyes open
after a pause even if it was garvey red was talkin about it dont follow that he killed him
no general opinion is that it was rustlers
why would rustlers take the evidence caldwell had with him
rocklin moves away to a large earthen jug holding water as dave talks
looks to me if you get the man who owned the marked cards you get the killer
drinking funny tho first the k
foreman then caldwell an now these women
lordy you aint thinkin somebody might try bumpin them
slowly to himself im not so sure somebody hasnt tried already to dave remember when we stopped to change horses on the way over from garden city shore you told
me how jackson and clews tried to frame stan
like they wanted to be sure hed keep his mouth shut about something
dave sits down on a box sitting against the wall directly under the large earthen jug of water
and layin that gun across my skull an offerin to drive the coach themselves
a dark mysterious figure on a horse raises his rifle nods it was almost as if a shot splinters the windowpane and shatters the earthen jug on the shelf directly
above daves head
the contents pour down on dave and he topples over
rocklin meanwhile has wiped the lantern off the table and ducked
they are both on the floor in the faint glow coming from the fireplace
going to dave you all right
blustering will be if i ever get dry
rocklin takes off his hat and puts his finger through two holes drilled by the bullet
lookit that good lord rocklin puts the hat aside crawls over to his gun belt straps it on
come on he opens the door cautiously
then sneaks out followed by dave
rocklin and dave stand close to the cabin just clear of the door tensely scanning the surrounding darkness
water can be heard dripping from the cabin roof and an owl hoots in a near by tree
the sound of neighing horses comes from the direction of the corral
both men re act
almost immediately the neighing is repeated but this time from another direction entirely and from a distance
thats not your team
he moves to the corner of the cabin followed by dave
and now it starts away galloping through the deep grass at the edge of the clearing
only the lower part of the animal is seen along with the legs of the rider
and they can barely make out their quarry riding hell bent toward the deep blackness of the trees
rocklin fires and runs out into the moonlight in the clearing dave close behind
rocklin halts fires again and again
the mysterious rider is now swallowed by the night
dave starts after him again
looking back he sees rocklin has not moved
come on no use hes gone
mebbe we winged him
he starts through the wet grass alone
rocklin turns back toward the cabin
he has reached the edge of the clearing where a slight embankment leads to the level of the trees
he is just starting up to higher ground when his eyes catch something on the embankment shining in the moonlight
it proves to be a tobacco pouch bearing a steers head of hammered sliver
it is dry so has evidently just been dropped
dave pockets it and proceeds warily along the mystery riders trail
he looks back in daves direction and then looking toward the cabin suddenly stops and tenses
and through it rocklin can plainly see an indistinct form moving in the faint glow of the dying fire
rocklin has reached the entrance unheard and silently watches the strange figure its back to him now headed for the fireplace with his saddlebag taken from the bunk
he sees the intruder start emptying his saddlebag on the bench in the light of the fire
he sees him suddenly stop and pick up something hidden from his view
at that instant rocklin slams the door shut
the intruder whirls around
it is arly tense and now defiant
the two regard each other like vicious animals in the same cage
arlys heart is pounding but you would never know it
and now rocklin his gun away starts closing in slowly but arly holds her ground her eyes never leaving his
when rocklin reaches arly he takes her one hand from behind her back and slowly forcing it up sees what is obviously claras letter in her tightly clenched fist
he tries to open her hand and arly knowing she lacks the strength to prevent it suddenly whips out a knife with her free hand
but that quick rocklin grabs the knife hand and without any apparent effort wrenches it free of her grasp and tosses it across the room where it lands on the
arly relaxes her grip on the letter meanwhile and rocklin gets it and tears it very deliberately letting the pieces fall at her feet
he turns his back on her now going over to his hat on the floor
arly is furious in her helplessness and humiliation
and rocklins smug manner isnt helping any
he picks up his hat and glancing at arly puts his finger once more through the bullet holes
smiling wryly not bad shootin
right back at him you think i did that
sure to draw us away from here
looks at his hat you know you cut it mighty close good thing i aint got brains enough to fill it
rocklin puts his hat on
he sees arly looking down at the torn letter
suppressing smile too bad you had to come way up here through that storm for nothin
affectedly i havent minded a bit harshly because i came up to fire you
oh nods i see
rocklin goes toward the bunk with his saddlebag
get out of here get off the santee and dont ever come back
mind if i wait for dave
he ought to be along any minute be funny if he winged that shadow of yours
if you mean juan youre loco
hes not even up here
mildly surprised you came up alone
half believing her then who was that we took out after
the man who shot at you
rocklin sits on the bunk and casually picks up arlys knife
who was he
i dont know
you mean you wont tell
i mean i dont know why should i lie to you
that last from arly brings a kind of smile to rocklins face a smile that says in effect are you kidding
he gets up from the bunk to go to the door and finding himself still holding arlys knife throws it back to her in a seemingly casual manner
it passes too close to arly for comfort and rocklin just opening the door gets the knife right back that close to his ear he feels the breeze
he looks at it quivering in the door
then moving to arly in what could be construed as a threatening manner he takes her in his arms and kisses her
arly is caught completely unaware
rocklins action disarms her
but it is after all what she really wants so before the kiss ends arlys arms slowly entwine themselves around rocklins neck
in the middle of the kiss rocklin gently but forcefully takes her arms from around his neck and puts her from him
i guess you forgot you jes fired me
he goes to the bunk picks up his saddlebag coat etc
and starts for the door
arly has been silently watching
turning near the open door so long
daves voice is heard just outside the cabin door
hey rock dave now rushes through the door puffing and excited
he got away but guess what i he sees arly and pulls up abruptly
slowly to dave you guess rocklin gives arly a disparaging side glance and starts out
to dave who is trying to figure things out come on
rocklin is headed for the corral as dave catches up to him
glancing back to the cabin fer a man whos got a despise fer wimmin you sure do get all snaggled up with em
arly her back to us is standing in the open doorway watching the two headed for the corral
her mood is evidenced by the manner in which she suddenly slams shut the door
as she turns and leans against it we see tears in her eyes and hear suppressed sobs
her eyes light on the bits of torn letter and presently we see her face set itself grimly and now she walks toward the fireplace and passing the torn bite
of paper kicks at them viciously
long shot of rocklin as he comes riding into town
as he nears the corner where the stage and haroldays office is situated the camera moves in getting rocklin and one of the harolday employees repairing the wooden sidewalk near
the hitching rail
as he dismounts you work for harolday
the man nods
heres one of his horses ill pick up my saddle later
he enters the building
panning shot on harolday as he sits at the desk working on a ledger
the sound of a door opening is heard
harolday looks up casually as if expecting a customer then suddenly gapes
camera pans to include doorway in which stands rocklin
frowning i thought i sent you up to table top
slowly what happened
taking off his hat well this for one thing
he pokes a finger through the hole in the crown
haroldays eyes narrow
after a little pause i told you youd regret letting that rat clews off so easy
rocklin looks at him with a queer expression without replying
whats the matter
dont you think it was him then
slowly i been figgerin
dont seem reasonable clews was in condition to take that sort of chance alone
besides how could he have known i was up there that soon
and george clews aint the only one ive run contrariwise to in this town
theres that mexican for instance
he as good as told me yesterday that him and me was due for a run in one of those days
suddenly nodding toward window and then theres him
harolday looks sharply toward the window
shot from office window
clint is hurrying across from the direction of the sun up saloon toward the office
panning shot on clint as he enters from street and crosses to the door of haroldays office
shot on door of inner office with harolday at desk in f
as the door opens it conceals rocklin from clint
excitedly i just heard that that rocklin was sees rocklin slowly was what
subdued was shot at last night
very calm mr
rocklin was just telling me all about it
significantly any idea who might have done it
clint looks quickly at harolday and back at rocklin with frightened eyes
rocklin makes no reply
you aint trying to pin it on me
his courage returning cause if you are youre in for a big disappointment
i was over at the sun up playing poker with the judge and the rest of the boys till early morning
if you dont believe me ask for yourself
after a pause all right
i believe you
but that dont mean you couldnt tell a thing or two as would help if you wanted
very nervous again what dyou mean
what sort of thing would clint here know about that would help identify the man who tried to kill you last night
this for one
he pulls out the tobacco pouch which dave found at table top
ever seen it before
clint as he stares wide eyed at the pouch
group with rocklin and harolday both watching clint intently
harshly well go on speak up
did you ever see it before
avoiding haroldays eye no
course i didnt suddenly raging at rocklin quit riding me
i dont know nothin about it i tell you
jest because i had a run in with you over a game o cards that dont mean id sneak up on you in the dark and
rocklins disdainful smile takes the speech out of clint who just sort of runs out of words
rocklin hesitates for a second then moves toward the door
harolday and clint are at window looking past camera toward the street
they see rocklin carrying his saddle walking toward the sun up
shorty davis hails rocklin says something to him and points to the sun up
rocklin leaves walking faster
frowning deeply he means trouble
he turns from camera toward the desk
still at window aw what do i care
turning on him with cold fury listen i never did have much use for you
youre a poor specimen at the best but as a would be bad man youre nothing but a laughing stock
why the way you lied about that pouch just now wouldnt have deceived a six year old
harshly all right let it go at that
but i got myself to think of
it wouldnt suit me at all just now to have you shown up in public for what you are by that trouble shootin cowhand
my advice to you is to get out of the district and stay out
taking a key from his vest pocket youll find some money in the safe at the ranch
take what you need and put the key in the desk drawer
rocklin comes down the hall carrying his saddle and looking at the room numbers
as he nears the f
he locates the room he is looking for it is a room facing toward the rear of the sun up
almost immediately the door opens and clara stands there flushed and embarrassed
rocklin this is the room in which clara has arranged to meet rocklin who later takes it as his own
shot at door as rocklin steps into the room
im so glad ive found you i was on my way to the santee and learned you were in town
putting his saddle etc
aside just got in
i feel perfectly awful running after you like this but you got trouble eh
my aunt found out i wrote you and made a terrible scene you havent signed everything over to that garvey have you
no and because i refused auntie said she would sign an affidavit that im still underage and then as my guardian she can do what she likes
got anything to prove youre not underage
after a slight pause no but mr
garvey has a letter that would prove it
my aunt wrote it before we came out here
spose we could get it
hed never give it to me
starts for door wait here
with a slight start toward rocklin oh please you she hesitates not quite sure what to say you wont go getting yourself in trouble i id rather give up everything
i mean rocklin notes her confusion
he regards her with a slight sympathetic smile
then opens the door and exits
close shot a letter written in a bold feminine hand
it reads in answer to your letter of the th kindly be advised that my niece clara caldwell became of age january th of this year
and although i am no longer her legal guardian it behooves me as her nearest kin to show continued interest in her affairs the camera holds long enough for the
letter to be read
and now the letter begins to be consumed in a flame as the camera pulls back showing the burning letter in judge garveys hand
he is standing over the potbellied stove in his office and miss martin is close to him watching the letter burn
garvey finally lets it fall from his fingers onto the top of the stove
he lifts the lid lets the remains fall inside and smiles to miss martin
that takes care of that crosses to his desk now ill draw up an affidavit right away and everything will be taken care of as we want it
not too enthusiastic i certainly hope so its not myself im concerned about getting out the papers of course not
i cant say im very happy about doing this i only hope it works out for the best
its the better choice of two evils now lets see begins to write i elizabeth looks at miss martin it is elizabeth isnt it
yes elizabeth martin of danvers massachusetts do hereby the door opens and rocklin enters
miss martin who has been pacing nervously stops in her tracks
garvey taken completely by surprise feigns an affected casualness
rocklin eyes them both suspiciously as he slowly closes the door
leaning back in his chair well mr
rocklin this is indeed a surprise
didnt expect to see you so soon
i understood you were riding for the santee
coldly thats right
it is quite obvious to garvey that rocklin is here on business
he turns to miss martin
to miss martin perhaps youd better come back later miss martin is in accord with that suggestion and after giving rocklin the frigid eye flounces out slamming the door
garvey shakes his head wipes his brow and is returning to his desk
shot door to garveys office
miss martin has her ear glued to the panels
over scene comes rocklins voice
i came for that letter
miss martin reacts
shot garvey and rocklin
calmly did you say letter
thats right the one miss caldwells aunt wrote from out east sayin she was of age
no im afraid i dont
miss martin reacts with nod of satisfaction and leaves
rocklin goes to the filing cabinet where he opens the drawer marked c
as he fingers through the papers garvey sits back in his chair watching
what is your interest in this letter
my only interest is getting it
you realize what this is dont you
robbing armed robbery at that
rocklin pulls open the m drawer
i warn you youre in for a disappointment
not finding the letter in the m drawer rocklin goes to the desk and pulls the handle of one of the drawers
it is locked
has had about enough listens you suddenly controls himself theres nothing in there thatd interest you
grimly id like to make up my own mind about that
forces a chuckle all right ill open it just to convince you im not hiding any letter
garvey unlocks the drawer and opens it
it is found to contain nothing but two brand new decks of playing cards
the unopened decks of cards
back to scene
garvey seems a little too anxious to close the drawer and before he can do so rocklin has one hand inside
garvey checked for a second looks up at rocklin
whats the idea
rocklin slowly withdraws his hand holding one of the decks
these cards attempting to bluff it out anything wrong in a man having cards in his possession
depends on what kind they are specially when theyre under lock and key
the two regard each other silently a moment
now rocklin casually slips the deck he holds into his pocket
too politely youre taking those i presume
he takes a step away
garvey turns him by touching his arm
has had almost enough now you look here soberly youre the one who better start lookin lookin for a way out for killin red caldwell
blanches caldwell takes up one of the decks of cards he found out about these and you went and killed him
with an affected smile and unnatural calmness and you believe a story like that
i will until i hear a better one
puts deck he holds in his pocket ill just take this along the district judge at garden city should be mighty interested
he starts around the desk toward the door
from the corner of his eye he catches garvey reaching for a gun in the middle drawer
before he can raise it rocklin is on him with a blow that sends garvey reeling back toward the stove
rocklin starts for the door again and just misses being struck by a chair which garvey hurls with vicious fury
the chair crashes against a window
the sound of breaking glass attracts the attention of passers by as well as miss martin seated in her surrey with sammy the k
the two are now fighting in earnest
of the fight intercut with townspeople gathering outside
dave pulls up in his wagon
it is pretty well wrecked
rocklin has garvey just about done in
he gives him one final sunday punch and garvey goes down and stays down
at that moment dave and pap fossler enter followed by other curious natives
say looks like you two been disagreein bout somethin to fossler who has gone over to garvey he aint daid is he
not permanently i dont reckon
what happened anyways
to rocklin you musta found out somethin
with a wink to dave i reckon the judge did too
they exit and almost immediately miss martin enters and after gaping in horror at the appearance of the place sees the judge who having regained consciousness bestirs himself on the
oh dear dear are you hurt
getting up painfully get out of my way garvey on his feet now makes for the door leading to his living quarters at the back of the office
miss martin follows him
haughtily now dont you use that tone of voice to me going through doorway ill have you understand i she sees the bed and shrieks upon realizing where she is
and backs out quickly almost catching the door which garvey slams in her face
rocklin and dave as they walk from garveys office
dave has a time hopping along against rocklins strides
find out who owns that tobaccy pouch yet
staring straight ahead no but get hold of clint harolday
clint is he in on it
cant say for sure bring him to the sun up and dont take no for an answer
dave leaves and exits from shot in the direction of the stage office
rocklin goes off toward the sun up
juan is lounging against the corner of the building soberly watching rocklins approach
as rocklin comes into the scene he spots juan and stops a moment as though deciding whether or not to question him
during this juan casually takes his ornamental tobacco pouch from his pocket and begins to roll a cigarette
the camera pans rocklin to the side of the building and up the outer stairs
rocklin comes through the door and down the hall
he reaches his room and is about to open the door when he hears a familiar voice inside
so now you know the truth
and if you think you can steal him away from me youre welcome to try it
rocklin frowns and enters
rocklin steps into the room holding the door partly open as he focuses his attention on arly
clara who has been sitting in the rocker near the window gets up and is the first to speak
anxiously did you get it
rocklin closes the door
no but i dont think its gonna matter much you go on back to the k
and ill be out in the mornin and take you with me to garden city to see the district judge
but i hate putting you to that trouble
no trouble at all im going anyway
casually you look like youve been fighting
soberly what are you doin here
i was just telling miss caldwell about well you and me
his eyes narrowing what about you an me
sensing the static in the atmosphere i think id better be going
turning quickly from arly just a minute glances at arly what all has she been tellin you
embarrassed oh oh really id rather not interrupting go ahead tell him looks at rocklin and goes on defiantly and i dare him to deny it
that she was with you last night at the cabin in the mountains
well why should i deny it
quickly and didnt you make love to me
this is getting a bit thick for him make love to you forcing her point you didnt kiss me i suppose
did you expect me to deny that too
smiles at clara you see
to clara now maybe you ought to hear what ive got to say clara is terribly hurt but struggles to be grown up about it
please you neednt explain
after all it really isnt any of my business is it
in the pause he looks at arly you little quickly thats it start swearin to clara just like a man
if there wasnt a lady here id do more to you than swear
i dont know how i can ever thank you for trying to help me
i do appreciate it ever so much to arly dont think too harshly of me will you i clara can say no more without breaking
so she turns away quickly and hurries out the door
rocklin does a slow burn as he glares at arly
sincerely after a pause shes lovely isnt she
so sweet honest and helpless
rocklin makes no reply
pity you didnt fall in love with her instead of me
arly is being ridiculous now
he ignores her remarks and concentrates his attention on one of his hands he may have sprained it slightly in the fight
you mights well know right now that you or no woman is ever goin to get me
dont be so sure i dont think im doin so badly
dont you know
i know there aint a dirty trick you wouldnt play to get what you want
smiling i always get what i want
she takes a folded piece of paper out of her pocket and drops it on the dresser as rocklin watches her
opens the door bye now the door closes
rocklin stands a moment
now curiosity brings him to the dresser where he takes up the paper and unfolds it
the torn pieces have all been sorted and pasted together on a sheet of paper back to scene
rocklin holds the letter
he is mad
he shakes his head what a gal now he is almost smiling almost
he folds the letter puts it in his pocket
takes off his gun belt and hangs it over the rocker near the window and stretches out on the bed as we on clara hurrying toward the front door in
a suppressed state of excitement
she has presumably just arrived at the ranch in advance of miss martin
she enters the house after a glance toward the gate
clara enters hastily and beats a path to the door of her room
the door flies open
clara bursts in closing the door in the same movement
her eyes swing to someone o
and she freezes to the spot
miss martin standing by the window cold and threatening
she has not taken the time to remove her hat
after a moments pause she moves slowly toward clara
the camera pans with her into a two shot
clara her back pressing harder and harder against the door becomes more terrified at the others approach
miss martin appraises the girl a short moment and now suddenly slaps her hard across the face
clara opens her mouth about to scream but even stifles this impulse under the cold stare of her aunt
quietly but viciously whatever is to become of you
clara can only stare as one under an hypnotic spell
have you no sense of pride or decency
throwing yourself at that that wretch like any shameless hussy
clara hasnt moved
i thought wed done with him but no you have to run to him and tell him all our business clara merely gasps for a breath of air but miss
martin thinking her about to speak goes on more forcefully now
dont you dare deny it you know very well you told him about that letter i wrote mr
clara remains silent
clara now utterly broken moves away
miss martin her eyes still rivited on the girl follows
the office has been more or less cleaned up since the fight
garvey is discovered near the window
he has cleaned himself up but bears some evidence of the fight
he is reading a letter as sammy the k
china boy stands waiting near the door
the message is written in the same bold hand of miss martin already seen in the previous letter mr
garvey i have just learned that despicable rocklin person intends to take clara to garden city in the morning evidently to have you investigated
i thought you had better know about it
back to scene
garvey puts the message in his pocket as he addresses sammy
tell miss martin that ill take care of everything
you take clare of evelything
on rocklin stretched across the bed examining the cards in the light of a lamp
garvey comes from around the buildings corner and peers furtively through the darkness toward the lighted windows of rocklins room
the area in front of the sun up
daves wagon pulls up to the hitching rail in front of the saloon
clint stripped of his gun is driving with dave alertly watching him
they get down from the wagon and dave prods clint toward the corner of the building
garvey has left the spot where we saw him look up to rocklins window
we now see him as he rounds a rear corner of the building and goes toward the outer stairs leading to the sun ups second floor
he starts up the steps and stops almost immediately and stares o
from garveys angle as he sees dave bringing clint from around in front of the building toward the stairway
garvey steps quickly to the ground and takes up a position around the roar corner
he watches the two men approach the stairway and go up
he moves out of the shot now going toward the street
the camera holds on the corner and we see tala come into view as though from nowhere and take the exact position at the buildings corner vacated by garvey only
a moment before
it is apparent that he is watching garvey and after a momentary pause he too moves stealthily out of the scene
panning shot on rocklin asleep
he is fully dressed as we last saw him with the exception of his boots
he is stretched full length on top of the covers
his gun belt still hangs over the rocker close to the open window
a knock on the door brings him to a sitting position
come in camera pans to door as clint enters reluctantly followed by the triumphant dave
here he is rock
caught him jist in time near the santee
headed fer out id say
sit down clint
to dave as he reaches into his pocket how about goin down below an havin one on me
he tosses dave a coin who catches it
then rocklin puts on his boots
delighted well now thats right thoughtful holler if you need me
belligerently as he stands near the window whats this all about
calmly as he stands up it aint gonna do you any good to get all het up and tough kid rocklin begins rolling a cigarette as he moves toward clint
i just want to ask you a few questions thats all
an unidentifiable form is seen moving through the darkness toward the outer stairway
as it nears the stairway the camera moves in so that as the mysterious figure begins stealthily up the stairs we see only the feet through the rungs
the camera then pans quickly and zooms into a close shot of juan across the alley
and now through juans eyes we watch the ascent of the mysterious intruder the mexicans line of vision gradually raises then the eyes slowly move across the camera as the
dark figure proceeds along to the rear portion of the verandah
rocklin finishes rolling his cigarette and lights it
i told you once i dont know who owns that pouch and i dont know who shot you
calmly forget it thats not what i want to talk to you about anyway
harshly well what do you want to talk about
come on get it over with
the mysterious form has moved past the darkened windows along the verandah and is nearing rocklins lighted room stops close to the open window
shot rocklin and clint
clint i want you to tell me why garvey murdered red caldwell clint tenses stares finds breathing difficult
you know dont you
oh yes you do
advancing on him and youre going to tell me all about it
i dont know nothing i tell you rocklin slaps clints face open handed throwing him off balance then grabs him by the shirt front
i tell ya i
hitting him again talk
completely terrified clint opens his mouth as if about to speak
suddenly he sees something out of the shot over rocklins shoulder and his expression changes
rocklin looks quickly in the same direction
a gloved hand has come out of the dark and is reaching through the window for rocklins gun in the belt which is hanging over the chair
clint and rocklin
the latter is still looking toward the window
with a swift movement clint picks up the water jug from the washstand and brings it down on rocklins head
as rocklin falls out of shot clint turns to the window with a triumphant smile
suddenly his expression changes
in a hoarse scream no
there is a shot from o
and clints hands go to his stomach
with a gasp of pain he doubles up and collapses on the floor
the hand of the killer pitches the gun toward rocklin and disappears
lined up at the bar are dave pap fossler shorty davis and a few others
cap is in his usual place
at the poker table are doc riding sam haynes ab jenkins and one or two others
the shot has evidently been heard for everything seems to have stopped and dave and pap fussier are looking up toward the ceiling as are others
now dave snaps back to life gulps down his drink and hurries toward the stairs
as he starts up the others move slowly in the same direction
rocklin is on the floor groggy
he shakes his head and as his senses return he picks up the gun and just gets to his feet as dave rushes in
dave sees clints body on the floor notices the gun in rocklins hand
he opens his mouth to speak but nothing comes out
all he can do is stare and grimace
the sound of hurrying feet comes from the hall and presently the mob closes in crowding the room and the hall
pap fossler who has been one of the first to enter kneels over clint
during this there are general ad libs from the crowd
who is it
clint harolday etc
wheres doc riding
get the doc
hey doc he was down below
here he is
docs voice is heard from the hall as he makes his way through the jam
here i am look out men let the doc through
doc riding comes through the crowd kneels beside pap fossler
he needs only a glance to know he can be of no use
breaking the silence somebody better fetch harolday
shortys already gone for him
getting up better get arly too
a voice is heard from the hall
she was at the hotel a while ago
looking down at clint and shaking his head he was only a kid
rocklin still holding his gun as he stares down at clints body o
now he studies the faces of the mob
of the crowd
there is nothing but a sea of hostile faces
whats goin on here gang way the crowd parts to admit jackson who comes stalking in followed by judge garvey
whats the trouble here he stops abruptly as he sees clints body
now he levels his eyes on rocklin
with a bitter smile i warned you didnt i
well i guess this is the last trouble youll ever make in this town
extending his hand hand over that gun
just a minute now he steps back so no one is behind him
and there is something about his manner and tone that urges jackson to use discretion
to the crowd generally i know it looks bad but i didnt kill the kid
the crowd stares in skeptical silence
even dave thinks rocklin is lying and now does his best to protect his friend
i believe you
to the others his gun was layin over there on the floor when i come in and cutting in no it wasnt it was right in my hand like it
if you didnt know him then who did
i dont know looks at garvey but im going to find out
harolday followed by shorty davis is making his way down the hall from the inner stair landing
as he nears the crowd gathered at rocklins door juan comes into view down the hall having just entered through the door leading out onto the verandah
as he nears rocklins door where is he
wheres my boy
harolday enters over the ad libs of the mob followed by shorty davis
during the following action juan enters and stands near the door silently taking in everything
harolday as he sees clints body and stops dead in horror
he turns to rocklin
with cold violence you murderer
i didnt do it mr
quickly then who did
from crowd he had a gun in his hand when we come in
smoothly and ill bet its the same one the bullet that killed clint came out of
rocklin gives garvey a hard slow look
well what do you say to that
you admit it
yeah but that still dont say i killed him
aw take him away liar lock him up sheriff the yellow bellied etc
she stares down at clint
an expression of pity comes over her
now she looks coldly at rocklin
softly why did you do it
with rocklin in f
he admits it was his gun that shot him
whose eyes havent left rocklins but you didnt fire it
slowly clint and me was having a bit of an argument
quickly what about
searching for words about whether he was going to help clear up a few things thats been bothering me and some others round these parts
looking at garvey for instance who it was shot red caldwell
still at garvey and the k
and who took that shot at me up at table top last night
and why certain people are so anxious to get rid of the caldwell girl
how would clint know about all that
harshly hes lying
hes trying to cover up for killing my boy
encouraged by the support quit stalling rocklin
he makes a tentative movement toward rocklin but arly intervenes
wait a minute hes get a right to be heard
to rocklin well were listenin
well clint was getting all set to talk when somebody snuck up along the verandah there and pulled the gun out o my belt
indicating the belt on chair and let him have it
there is a moments amazed silence
then the crowd breaks into derisive comment
what a story
what an alibi
string him up the heel
grinning youll have to think up something better than that rocklin
with garvey in f
smoothly dont be a fool rocklin
you know you cant get away with a yarn like that
why dont you save yourself and everyone else a lot of trouble by surrendering to the sheriff
after all it isnt such a crime in these parts to kill a man in self defense
everyone knows what clint was like
he probably lost his head and pulled a gun on you like he did at the sun up that night
wasnt that it
grimly after a little pause no that wasnt it
and till i do what i got to do i aint surrenderin to anybody least of all to your pal here
indicates sheriff if i got to be shot for knowing too much it aint going to be in the back in a framed up jail break
arly who has been staring at rocklin in frowning bewilderment
but if someones trying to kill you why didnt they do it just now
why did they have to kill clint
guess they wanted to get clint too
doin it this way they get us both
clint first an me afterwards like i jus said
with garvey in f
close beside him are pap and dave who watches garvey closely
quit fancy talk
i might be able to tell you that later
quickly no you wont because youre comin with me
raises his gun am i
the crowd tenses
rocklin eyes them grimly
the first one that moves gets it
he moves over to the open window and with his gun leveled on the mob steps out onto the verandah
once outside he suddenly lets the window fall and disappears
a shot from jacksons gun shatters a pane during which time there has been a rush to the window
it is arly and dave who reach it first and feigning an attempt to raise the window they momentarily delay pursuit
there is the inevitable jam as the pushing yelling crowd all try to exit at once
rocklin as he picks himself off the ground having dropped from the verandah
he starts quickly away
shooting into the room we see arly and dave shoved to one side by jackson and garvey
the window goes up and jackson steps out followed by garvey harolday arly dave and others
the human jam has been broken and now the mob dashes wildly toward the stairway and verandah exit in the b
the hitching rail in front of the sun up
there are a dozen or so horses tied up to it and close to it is daves team and wagon
rocklin comes from around the corner of the building and races to the hitching rail
jackson and garvey come from around the corner of the porch followed by harolday arly dave and others
at the stairs they collide with some of the men who have raced down the hall only to reach the stairway at the same moment
there is another jam on the landing as the mob all try to get down at once
he has cut the lines of the horses tied to the rail
we see him cutting the last line and fire into the air
the horses rare and stampede
and now there is a state of utter confusion as the mob and horses rush in all directions as the men try to retrieve their mounts
rocklin is no where in evidence
sarcastically well sheriff you certainly are to be congratulated
harassed look mr
harolday you saw what happened deeply concerned never mind that lets get going for garden city thats where hes headed for
dave climbs into his wagon behind the group as jackson exits quickly
at hitching rail
there are four or five horses tied up here
arly and juan enter and mount their horses and almost immediately garvey and harolday come hurrying into the scene after two of the other horses
shouts from her horse where do you think hes gone
before either of the two men can answer jacksons voice is heard shouting o
all right men follow me the camera pans around getting jackson now mounted as others come riding in
he rares his horse around and starts away followed by the mob including our principals
they do not get very far when daves wagon comes into the shot going hell bent in pursuit
the posse riding hard with daves wagon following
dave half standing as he urges his team on
behind him are the closed flaps of the wagon top
as a hand reaches out from between the flaps and grasps the reins
dave takes it and looks wildly around falls back on the seat
camera pulls back to include dave smiling broadly
rocklin is pulling hard on the reins
i mighta knowed youd do somethin like this
as rocklin slows the team what are we doin
headin for the k
with that rocklin starts swinging the team around
sammy the china boy is nervously knocking on miss martins door
it opens and miss martin is seen slipping a robe over her long mother hubbard nightgown with cap to match
impatiently now what is it
sammy points o
miss martin looks and freezes
as she moves down the hall the camera pans with her until it gets two men standing near the entrance door
now the camera moves in to a three shot and we recognize george clews and his brother bob
bob his wrist bandaged takes off his hat at miss martins approach and george noticing does likewise
the names clews maam mr
garvey sent us out eagerly said you were expectin trouble with that rocklin
acidly to george but im wondering if youre up to it
i noticed you didnt fare so well with him yesterday
he was drunk quickly yeah but im sober now
well see that you stay that way
dont worry maam ive jus bin waitin to get even with that saddle bum
he opens the door
with that oily smile well be close by
confidently you bet
they start out
clara is seen in her nightgown listening at the door to her room
the sound of the outer door closing comes over the scene and she hurries to her bed and feigns sleep and just in time for the door opens and miss
martin sticks her head in and satisfied that clara is sleeping exits
a raspy voice is heard coming out of the darkness singing a ribald song of the periods
and now old zeke riding his burro comes into view
as he passes close to the camera we pan and get the posse coming out of the darkness in the opposite direction zeke is travelling
as the posse pulls up to zeke the camera moves in on a group including zeke jackson garvey harolday
seen anybody ridin hard for garden city
bin on the road since sundown aint seen a livin soul be he man or beast
he mighta taken the cutoff through jaw bone canyon
after that storm
hed never make it
theres only one other place he might have gone the k
you think so
very definitely im positive
thats what you said before
shouting to the posse milling around to the k
the posse swings around and starts back toward santa inez
arly watches the posse then turns to juan
excitedly take me through the canyon
it is dangerous senorita
but if we get through well beat them to the k
you would risk your life for senor rocklin
arly does not answer in words
but juan sees the answer in her eyes
now she tosses her head defiantly and swings her horse off the road in the direction of the canyon
juan watches a moment then spurs his mount after her as we on clara tossing fitfully in her bed
suddenly she sits up as an idea begins to take form in her mind
now she hurries out of bed moves stealthily to the door and goes out leaving her door open
on door to miss martins room
clara comes down the hall to the door
she puts her ear close and listens
now she opens it cautiously and peers inside
the door to her room is slammed o
by a sporadic draft
it startles the girl and she quickly closes miss martins door and hurries away
on the posse riding hell bent
arly and julio as they slowly pick their way along the difficult trail skirting a roaring torrent
julio is leading and close behind him arly is having a time negotiating the unsteady ground of a landslide
she notices julio staring o
and slowly shaking his head
julio nods his head slowly deliberately
only for you you must not do this i will go through from here alone
a faint smile of admiration brushes arlys face
no were going through together
arly lashes her horse away
julio realizes the futileness of further pleading and now moves his horse out after arly
the wagon with dave and rocklin coming out of the night
dave is driving the team for all it is worth
rocklin is looking back
he turns to dave
you can ease up now
were just about there
a wooden gate is swung closed across the roadway
on the gate is a crudely printed weather beaten sign k
over the scene comes the sound of the wagon approaching
rocklin hops out opens the gate
dave drives the wagon through
as rocklin lets go the gate it swings closed of its own accord
the shed is a short distance from the caldwell house
bob clews is standing at a corner of the shed looking o
over the scene comes the sound of the wagon
peering into shed hey george george get up
the wagon moving slowly through the cottonwoods along the drive not far from the house
it stops now and the camera moves closer to get dave and rocklin as they leave the team and start stealthily toward the house seen in the moonlight in the
we pick up clara in the act of nervously pinning on her hat in the dim light of a small lamp
she is fully dressed and once the hat is on she looks around anxiously for her top coat which she finds in the closet
she takes the coat and starts hurriedly toward the lamp sitting on a small taboret near the door
as she bends over to blow it out her eyes raise and she freezes
now she snaps the door closed without removing her eyes from clara and starts forward
the camera pulls back to include the two
clara stands as one under an hypnotic spell
in a very low tone you vile ungrateful strumpet running away in the night like a deceitful sneak thief unrestrained yes im running away and its all your fault youre
the one whos been deceitful and sneaking and dont think i dont know what you intend doing
very controlled and dont think i dont know what you intend doing
crying as she moves away i dont care im not ashamed of it and nothing you can say or do is going to stop me
hardly above a whisper you little fool if you go to garden city with that man you stand to lose everything
stops pacing but why
why are you being so secretive
if you know something why dont you tell me
nods and mumbles to himself yeah why dont you
rocklin quickly shushes dave
unmindful of the presence of the men all right ill tell you rocklin is a nephew of the late mr
and as nearest of kin he stands to get everything according to the will
because you are not the old mans niece but only his grand niece
rocklin turned up unexpectedly and you and mr
garvey knew the truth all the time
if dave keeps quiet any longer hell burst
he spins rocklin around and speaks in his natural voice
and you knew the truth all the time too didnt you
no wonder you stuck around from rocklins expression it is quite apparent to dave that he is right
both women are staring dumbly toward the window
now the realization that she has been overheard staggers miss martin
she utters a stifled scream and seeing rocklin starting through the window runs from the room
get in here and take care of her
dave scrambles through the window and hurries in pursuit of miss martin
rocklin is at claras side
bushes near the house
george and bob clews are crouched watching
come on they move out
the posse riding hard
we see arly and julio as they descend a steep embankment toward the raging torrent
they both are riding julios horse
arly and julio arly seated behind julio considerably disheveled and sobbing
comfortingly you are crying senorita
lying bravely no
knows she is it is too bad we lose your horse
she was good horse for sure
if only we make it in time
as they move away into a longer shot a huge boulder comes crashing down the canyon side across their path and tumbles with a great roar and splash into the
clara is talking feverishly to rocklin
and i heard one of them tell my aunt not to worry that he was just as anxious as she was to get even with you
dave enters from the hall carrying miss martin over his shoulder
he has her wrapped in a sheet and bound up in tassled curtain cord
as clara and rocklin react this is the only way i could handle her
the clews are around here some place garvey sent em out
george and bob clews at the window
george has his gun leveled and a dirty smile twists his face
you bet were around
the camera pulls back as george clews climbs into the room followed by bob
they disarm both rocklin and dave as clara watches helplessly and miss martin struggles in her wrapping
to bob untie her
to dave untie her
dave puts miss martin down and begins undoing her as bob covers him with his gun
the posse riding
arly and juan leave the hazardous trail behind and now start across the flat on a run
dave has unwrapped miss martin and she gets to her feet bristling
to bob now tie him up
indicates dave quickly as she picks up the tassled cord ill take part in this you you hairy beast
bob clews tosses the sheet over daves head
and as dave struggles rocklin thinks he has george off guard and makes a pass at him
but george is on the alert and strikes rocklin on the head with his pistol
she utters a choked cry and falls to the floor in a faint
as miss martin comes to clara and kneels beside her
help me get her to the bed
of the room
bob clews has dave securely tied and now assists miss martin in getting clara to the bed
indicating rocklin on the floor whatll we do with em
take them in to mr
garvey and tell him i must see him at once
triumphantly well dump them right in the judges lap
george clews picks up the unconscious rocklin
still administering to clara hadnt you better tie him too
to bob after a seconds pause get some more rope
bob hurries to do so
the posse riding
bob clews is seen dumping dave into the rear of the wagon
george clews stands near him with rocklins unconscious form over his shoulder
now he puts rocklin in
get our horses and meet me at the gate
bob runs after the horses
george gets onto the wagon seat swings the team around and heads for the gate
arly and juan riding hard
george clews sits in the wagon waiting for bob who now comes out of the darkness with their horses
he dismounts ties the horses to the back of the wagon comes around in front to the gate
he is about to swing it open when he looks past the camera at arly and juan who now pull up to the outside of the gate
arly dismounts quickly her gun in her hand
bob clews backs up toward the wagon as arly walks through gate
george clews on the wagon seat
he is smiling and is going to try to bluff it out
to arly what are you doin with that gun arly
get down from there before i show you
rocklin has regained consciousness and listens
now listen arly this aint your wagon neither is it yours get down out of there before i knock you down
rocklin recognizes arlys voice
now he raises himself up over the tailboard and falls out
the horses tied in back shy as rocklin falls to the ground
arly as she takes it and starts toward the rear of the wagon
he no more than gets it out when a knife whirls in from o
getting him in the small of the back
he sits calmly astride his horse his gun leveled on george clews
arly is cutting the rope binding rocklin
and theyre headed this way and should get here any minute rocklin gets to his feet
arly notices something shining on the ground where rocklin lay
she picks it up
it is the tobacco pouch with the steers head of hammered silver
whered you get this
taking the pouch that belongs to the man who shot at me on table top dave found it
on daves wrapped form kicking the wagon tailboard
arlys head appears between the flaps above the tailboard and as dave groans and kicks she takes her knife and slits the rope binding him
rocklin has come to george clew and we see him wrest the gun from his hand and yank george down from the wagon seat
once down he lets him have a hard right that sends him sprawling
they start fighting viciously
arly rushes in crying wildly
trying to stop rocklin youve got to get away theyll be here theyll catch you rocklin
there is but one thought in his enraged mind clews
he tears into him again
frantically youve got to stop him hes got to get away
the posse approaching
rocklin arly dave rocklin is about done in from the fight
anxiously come on lets git goin as he walks to wagon wheres the girl
back at the house weve got to get her
you havent time theyre coming dont you believe me
to dave come on arlys plea goes unheeded and he starts away toward the house on the run
mutters stubborn as an ole mule
shouts youre puttin a rope around your neck dave runs after rocklin
get him indicates bob clews out of sight and follow me
she takes up the reins now and swings the team around and off the road into the thickness of the trees
rocklin and dave
they are approaching the house warily
softly but whatll we do with the ole lady
anything you like
id like to pizen her
arly is seated on the wagon seat looking toward the gate as juan comes in on his horse
the posse rides up
the gate is swung open and they ride through
arly jumps to the ground and speaks to juan
as she starts toward the house juan dismounts and follows
the posse comes riding in
jackson garvey harolday and a few others dismount and go toward the door
as they move stealthily into a spot shielded by undergrowth which gives them full view of the front and one side of the house
miss martin is coming into the room with a glass and a pill for clara who is still stretched on the bed
if youll just take this youll go to sleep the sound of someone knocking on the front door comes over the scene
miss martin exits hurriedly
at front door
miss martin opens the door confronting jackson and the group
she is bewildered
evenin maam hate to bother you like this but seeing garvey interrupts im so glad youve come mr
garvey the most awful as though seeing the crowd for the first time why what are all these people doing here
were after rocklin has he been here
smugly oh yes here and gone
astounded gone triumphantly yes the two men you sent out are taking him and that horrid old man back to town
the clewses funny we didnt see them
somethin musta gone wrong we better fan out and see whats goin on
quickly dont leave mr
garvey ive got to talk with you privately as all but garvey and harolday go back to their horses garvey speaks
but madam its very important
garvey looks at harolday in a manner evidencing his distaste and impatience
well go on and meet you in town
perhaps youd better
calls to jackson o
ill meet you in town jackson
right come on men
the sound of running horses comes over the scene as harolday hurries away and garvey enters the house
he starts to mount but instead leads the horse into the bushes close to where juan and arly are watching
miss martin and garvey have been talking
garvey paces nervously
quickly as he turns to miss martin and youre positive he knows everything
absolutely everything he was standing at the window all the time the scoundrel
rocklin has his ear glued to the door
he cant help but smile at miss martins reference to him
dave is behind the curtain at the window watching the outside
clara is close to rocklin
whispers you better get back on the bed in case they come in here
clara tiptoes away
arly and juan as they watch harolday approach the house and go to the hall window
garvey and miss martin
garvey is still pacing very nervously
he is trying to think of his next move
if you were to ask me i think the best thing to do is garvey stops and glares
irritably im not asking you and dont bother me with your silly questions weve got to do something besides talk
drawing herself up you mean you have to do something
garvey stops and looks at her again
this was all your idea remember
tossing it off my idea thats all you know about it
it is open and rocklin stands there looking o
if theres anybody else in on it speak up judge
well i do declare she can say no more
rocklin steps away from the door where dave and clara now stand
he has garvey covered
dave is pointing his gun and grimacing at miss martin
at hall window on harolday watching
garvey is stepping back in a cold sweat toward miss martin as rocklin advances toward him
to garvey quite casually talk
miss martin opens her mouth about to speak
blasting to miss martin not you
her mouth snaps shut like a trap
garvey rocklin miss martin
rocklin takes the tobacco pouch out of his pocket
to garvey ever see that before
blanches no its not mine
tell me whose it is
shaking no no i dont know harolday at hall window
he raises his gun he is about to fire when a knife whirls out of nowhere and sticks in the window frame inches from haroldays head
he spins around and stares wildly here and there at the darkness
there is no one in evidence
drop that gun
he drops the gun
arly and juan come in to him
arly has him covered
the camera pulls back to a wider angle getting the front door as it is opened by rocklin who evidently heard arly
arly is prodding harolday into the scene
to rocklin he was just getting ready to finish you off through that window
harolday is herded inside close to garvey and miss martin
almost enjoying this you seem to like to do business through windows mr
in the pause harolday remains sneeringly silent
youre not clints killer by any chance cutting in by one bad chance glares at harolday juan saw you do it
harolday looks at juan who slowly nods
well now were gettin some place he brings up the tobacco pouch
but before he can ask about it arly speaks
that pouch is his indicates harolday juan made it for him a long time ago
to juan didnt you
rocklin with a sudden transition speaks to harolday in a hard threatening tone
to harolday why did you kill caldwell
harolday doesnt answer
he finally looks at garvey in desperation
perspiration runs down garveys forehead
suddenly harolday makes a mad dash for the door
rocklin shoots but arly pushes his arm and sends the shot wild
rocklin looks at her in amazement
julio hurries out
on harolday as he rushes madly across the clearing toward the bushes where his horse waits
the camera swings back to the porch in time to catch julio crossing it in pursuit of harolday
arly and rocklin come through the open door and stand on the porch watching
they see julio disappear in the brush
for a moment nothing happens now haroldays horse bolts out riderless and gallops away
now julio comes slowly into view
he moves slowly and deliberately back toward the house
julio comes in to rocklin and arly
the three exchange significant glances as we in the hall are clara and miss martin rocklin arly and julio dave and garvey
garvey is seated and has evidently been talking in the way of confession
harolday wanted the k
like he wanted the santee and the hardman place for his land scheme he planned on breaking up the ranches into small holdings and selling to dirt farmers
he pretended to be on the outs with me so i could get caldwells confidence
and when red caught me with the crooked cards and threatened to expose me harolday shot him
why did he kill clint
an not me
that shot was an accident it was meant for you
we planned on getting the women to let me handle their business interrupting furious and do us out of everything moves close to garvey you vile wicked despicable she is
beside herself in her anger and taking up a large vase sitting nearby she smashes it to pieces over garveys head
garvey goes down unconscious
miss martin rushes to her room screaming
clara follows her
when he wakes up well have him put everything on paper
well youll have to do the writin cause i dont know how to write
genuinely concerned oh mr
rocklin please i think auntie is out of her mind shes in her room laughing
grimaces what that ole pelican needs is a good spankin
who has been silently listening and ill bet youre just the one who can do it
his eyes flash with an idea yeah i believe i am
looks at the group i know i am
he starts away down the hall rolling up his sleeves
rocklins eyes wander to clara who seems quite at a loss
now he moves slowly toward her
in the b
arly watches rocklins every move
i guess theres no rush for you to get to garden city now after a slight pause in which she becomes conscious of arly clara speaks
no i dont suppose theres any rush there is another short pause
rocklin glances at arly and arly assuming they want to be alone turns and goes out the door leaving julio attending garvey
after arly goes if i was like her id stay in the west
that means youre goin back east cousin clara
smiles nods its where i belong i know that now its good to know where you belong i reckon wish i knew
wistfully i can tell you you belong with her rocklin takes it a faint smile brushes his face
he turns now and walks out
arly is seated on the shaft of an old wagon
the first rays of the morning sun streak through the trees across her as she smiles wistfully down at the antics of a little woodchuck cavorting on the ground close
in a moment rocklin comes into view in the b
he spots arly who has her back to him and walks over
his approach frightens the woodchuck away and turns arlys head toward him
neither has anything to say
now rocklin sits beside arly but faces the other way
after a pause thanks
there is another stilted pause
her eyes sweeping the morning beautiful day
reflecting it didnt start out so beautiful
thats true of lots of things
hesitantly well you and me
there is another pause
but worlds are being said in the language of eyes
their heads move closer and now rocklins arms sweep around the girl and they kiss
shouting hey rock rock get out your pencil and paper the two stop abruptly and look o
grimacing doggone it here garvey is back in this world an theyre out of it
