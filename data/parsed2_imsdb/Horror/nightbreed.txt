written by clive barker fade in scene
title sequence darkness
then a burst of sparks from a bowl held in a scaly hand
the light shows us a mural
we start to move along the wall
first we see stars and planets painted in a primitive stylized fashion on bare rock
a voice on the track speaks softly to us
voice we did not always live in hiding
we have come to the image of a huge family tree which springs from a single seed but divides into two separate halves
on the left ruled by the moon the branches blossom into extraordinary creatures
on the right by sunlight the branches end in ordinary human beings
upon the word nightbreed the title comes up on the screen against the image of a moon painted on the wall
scenes k deleted cut to a real moon
then cut wide to a moonlit landscape through which the camera careens madly
the soundtrack which was lush and almost sacred in the mural chamber erupts into a tribal rhythm
we glimpse creatures in the darkness moving through the reeds
they are barely more than silhouettes
we see teeth and gleaming eyes glimpses of naked patterned flesh
cut back to the mural chamber
now we have moved away from the tree to a more brutal scene
a symbolic representation of a great apocalyptic war between naturals and breed
terrible scenes of destruction
voice but the naturals made war on us
they feared us for our strength
they envied our powers
they called us monsters killing us by whatever means their malice could invent finding in each of us our particular vulnerability
we are scanning scenes of that war
a breed being staked like a vampire
another being shot like a werewolf
another exposed to sunlight
voice none of us was safe
the tribes of the moon dwindled
our gods were slaughtered our homes destroyed
it was the apocalypse
cut back to the landscape
the clouds roil above the heads of the creatures heading through the reeds
we see their destination now
a huge wall with gates
and back to the mural chamber and a final scene
the gates weve just seen are in the painting
looking over them calling the breed in is a vast indistinct form that of baphomet
his eyes burn his arms are open in welcome
voice only one of our gods survived the holocaust
wounded and near death he summoned us the last of the last into hiding
into midian where we wait now
the battle is over but not the war
there will come a saviour
now weve moved beyond the image of the gate into a new patch of wall on which the pictures are only vague sketches
we can interpret some of the images nevertheless a man with a bloody hole in the middle of his chest
a man wearing a mask like a skull
we linger on a faceless figure
voice his name is cabal
he will lead and give us back the night
we are the tribes of the moon
we are the nightbreed
the titles end
cut back to the landscape
now we are at the gates and the creatures slip through and away into the mist
only one a beautiful ferocious female called shuna sassi remains turning to look at us
the camera retreats from her
shuna will you not come
now the last of the creatures the drummer takes her by the arm snatching her away through the gates
as she disappears the camera follows again stopping at the gates themselves which close with an unearthly din
on boone closed eyes
he is dreaming
his gaze roves beneath his lids
loris lips come into shot kissing first his eyes and then traveling down his face to his mouth
boones eyes flicker open
now boones eyes are fully open
he sits up
looks towards the open window
she kisses him distracting him from the sight of the window
lori you want something to eat
what time is it
lori nine thirty
i was letting you doze
boone thought youd worn me out huh
lori smiles and kisses him then crosses the room to the kitchen area picks up some fruit and a knife carrying both back to where boone is lying on the
it is unmade
both lori and boone are lightly dressed clothes casually thrown on after an afternoon lovemaking
lori you know what
lori we should get out of calgary for a few days
just take off
boone anywhere special
lori somewhere we can be alone together
boone more alone than this
just you and me
no telephone calls
boone bad dreams

boone im going around in some crazy loop in my head
lori youre not crazy
lori say it like you mean it
boone i believe it

but i want this damn dream out of my head
he gets up and goes to the window
boone deckers started calling me again

lori if he can help see him

boone theyre not bad

boone im not going anywhere lori

lori i cant hear that often enough
boone ill never leave you
he kisses her passionately
boone cant remember a time when i didnt love you
lori how about before we met
boone even then
they kiss again
we move past them into the darkness outside the window
dissolve to the moon clearing cloud
a pleasant house in a pleasant neighborhood
lights burn inside
melissa rickman emerges from the lounge with a dagwood sandwich a work in progress
she is thirty five and going to seed in a gentle way
her husband lou rickman a similar type is planted in front of the television
melissa okay you want ham cheese pickle mustard

hows that sandwich coming
melissa disappears from the bottom of the stairs
melissa enters moves out of sight
we stay at the door
a figure appears dressed in black knives in both hands and crosses to leave the screen again
we do not see his face
but we hear his labours the sound of the blades slicing melissa
she staggers into view grabbing hold of her slit throat
blood bubbles between her fingers
the figure appears behind her
she turns as the knife descends
lou hears a sound rises and moves towards the kitchen door
at the top of the stairs lou two watches wide eyed
lou twos p
we see blood running along the highway
lou reaches the kitchen door and sees melissa laid out dead on the kitchen table lou oh god god
lou enters the figure emerges from behind him
while we remain at the door watching detached lou fights back throwing himself back and forth around the kitchen
but the figure is much stronger
we glimpse its face now it is a mask with a zipper for a mouth and buttons for eyes blank
devoid of compassion hatred or regret
a deaths head made by a mad child
atop the stairs lou two listens
his baby sister cries in her cot
he looks her way then back downstairs
the sounds cease
terror on his face
then the childs perfect nightmare appears at the bottom of the stairs
the figure heavy knife in hand starts to climb dragging lous bloody body after him by the hair
the phone rings
we move towards the answering machine which clicks on
boone on tape hi
please leave a message
lori thru phone boone pick up will you
are you there
okay so dont answer
see you tomorrow
three patrol cars an ambulance policeman restraining a small crowd gathered outside
sedan roars up red bubble light flashing and inspector joyce gets out and moves towards the house
hes greeted by the medical examiner dr burton just exiting carrying a medical bag
burton bitter brace yourself inspector
joyce same profile
doesnt miss a trick
joyce anguished kids
burton if its any comfort they went quickly
makes me feel a whole lot better about the sick fuck
burton find this guy joyce
they say these guys want to be caught
i think this one likes it too much
a rookie patrolman stands on the doorstep on the verge of tears
joyce gently lets get these tourists back officer
policeman yes sir
joyce to burton if we cant protect the kids what the hell use are we
the sun climbs above the horizon behind the cityscape of calgary
another day begins
close on a pile of tapes marked with dates over a period of two years
theyre on deckers desk
decker ive been listening to the tapes of our sessions
all two years worth
we move from the tapes to decker who gets up from his desk and moves around to the other side
boone is sitting on the other side of the desk his posture far from relaxed
he hates this room
as decker moves we take in the various pictures on the walls
dance pictures photographs of decker with civic dignitaries crippled children etc
decker most of my colleagues would have walked away from a case like yours
the most they would have done was drug you
you intrigued me
all the talk of monsters
boone that wasnt me
i heard about midian from other people
decker but you made it part of your private mythology
boone i suppose i did
it was a place of refuge
decker when you imagined yourself being taken off to this invented city to midian what crimes were you going to be forgiven
boones looking uneasy now
he wipes sweat from his upper lip
boone you know what i used to dream
theres a remarkable consistency in the images you see
almost as though the violence was real
boone they were just bad dreams
midian doesnt exist
monsters dont exist
decker but murder does boone
murders very real
it may start in the mind but it ends up changing to flesh and blood
he picks up the envelope we saw in his previous scene and takes the photographs out
two days ago the police brought me some photographs
they wanted to know if i had any patients who might be capable of whats in these photographs
im going to show you them
are you ready for that
decker lays the photographs on the table
boone picks them up
we get glimpses of what they contain
bloody scenes of corpses caught by the camera in grotesque positions sliced up and bleeding
boones breath quickens
when you talk about murder on the tapes i thought it was invention
now im not so sure
boone keeps staring at the pictures
the glassy eyes stare hard at him
his breathing is now rapid and shallow
one or two of the images seem to move
he drops the photographs
boone i didnt
decker didnt what
boone they were bad dreams
decker what you describe in your sessions is very specific
boone i dont remember
decker you want to hear
decker picks up the photographs
boone highly agitated gets up and paces the room
you think i did this
decker six families killed over a two year period
all within driving distance of calgary
boone fury do you think i did this
decker i hope to god you didnt for both our sakes
weve come a long way together
i dont want to believe this any more than you do
boone but you do
decker i wouldnt put us through this pain if i didnt
if i wasnt
afraid you had
boone desperate helpless what do i do
god tell me what to do
decker i can only go so far on your behalf
patient confidentialitys one thing
protecting a killer is another
boone breaking down jesus
decker returns to his desk
puts the photographs down and picks up a vial of prescription pills
he crosses to boone
decker listen to me
take these theyll help
go home and consider what weve talked about
im going to give you twenty four hours to go to the police and answer their questions of your own accord
thats as long as i can give you
if you havent complied by then im afraid ill have to tell them what i know
boone grabs the pills
i cant tell you how sorry i am
boone exits into the hall forces open the vial of pills swallows a couple shaking trying to control his terror
decker sits at his desk lifts his briefcase opens it tosses the folder of photographs into the case
looking into the case he seems on the verge of some powerful emotion
he snaps shut the briefcase
the emotion passes
boone enters the apartment his eyes wild
he slams the door and closes his eyes
boone studies the photographs in his hand and they come to life
boone opens his eyes
boone chews the pills
he is now sweating and shaking violently
boone strips off his clothes
boone opens his drawers and pulls out photographs his passport etc and starts to make a pile with them
he pours lighter fuel on the pictures and watches them burn
sitting against the wall still sweating he takes some more pills
we see loris love letters burn and hear her voice speaking the words as they are consumed
then he hears loris voice say lori boone
lori is sitting on the edge of the bed
boone looks round sees himself against the wall and moves forward past the real boone towards the bed
boone watches as he and lori make love on the bed
we close in on the love making
lori leans to kiss him
boone ill never leave you
cut back to boone his face all grief
boones hand pulls the shower curtain aside and turns on the water
the water pours on him
another of the murder scenes comes to life
corpses pulse with hideous animation
with a cry boone slides to the shower floor panting haunted destroyed
i did it
i did it all
behind him the last of the fire flickers
he looks through the blinds at the sunset
takes another pill
puts on his leather jacket
the door slams
lori is on stage sexy vivacious fronting a tight c w band in a hip rendition of johnny be angry
looking though the crowd in front of the stage
lori spots boone standing near the entrance his face in shadow
her eyes light up with joy as the song builds to climax
applause cat whistles foot stomping
loris in heaven
she looks out again
boone is gone
boone steps into view by the side of the road watches the traffic
confused and worried lori stands in the empty corridor a note boone has left for her in her hand
boone edges out closer to the road
spots a huge semi with a fully loaded trailer barrelling down towards him
lori opens the note and reads keep this
burn the rest
tears burst from loris eyes
boone flings himself in front of the oncoming truck
a blaze of light
a bustling emergency receiving area
a stern nurse goes through the pockets of boones jackets which is lying beside him on a gurney
his eyes are closed face and t shirt bloody
she fishes out the vial of pills
boone moans opens his eyes
nurse lucky youre in one piece fella
boone realizing where he is
cant even kill myself
nurse theres a cheerful thought
to an approaching doctor i dont know what kind of fuel hes using but this guys cruising at about feet
the doctor takes the vial of pills checks the label
opens boones eyes shines a penlight flash on the pupils
doctor takes his pulse
doctor you dont hit that altitude on lithium carbonate
lets get the prescribing doctor on the line
finally to boone okay were doing all right arent we
tell me whatve you been taking tonight partner
the doctor opens the vial looks at a handful of the pills
this isnt lithium my friend
to the nurse lets move him
observation lets get an iv valium saline milligrams percodan for pain as needed
quietly hands the pills to the nurse well have to call this in
with considerable effort boone sits up urgently and grabs the doctors hand holding the pills
boone what was i taking
doctor patronizing easy
we dont know until we run some tests
looks like some kind of lab quality psychotropic hallucinogen
youre on what we used to call a bad trip there buddy
you relax now youre gonna be fine
the doctor and nurse ease boone back down onto the gurney
the doctor moves away
the nurse pulls back the curtain and rolls boone across the hall into a semi private room from emergency behind them a warning buzzer sounds
voice thru loudspeaker code blue
in an emergency room cubicle a patient is having a seizure
the nurse rushes off leaving boone
interns roll the cardiac cart towards the cubicle and curtains close around the scene
the door to boones room swings closed shutting out the sounds
boone exhales heavily
closes his eyes
muttering half mumbled ranting shit
take me why dont you take me
boone opens his eyes
looks across the room at narcisse a wild man half derelict half punk bloodied his hand bandaged pacing back and forth like a caged cat staring out of a large
picture window at the night
looking in at the brightly lit window framed in the dark building as narcisse restlessly moves across it peering outside
narcisse low and anxious theyve gone theyve gone they were here they were coming for me whered they go
narcisse turns on him viciously shut up shut up
they saw you they wont come while youre here they wont show themselves to the likes of you dont you see that
boone placating knows the type sure okay
ive missed them ive missed them
you scared them off you kept them from me
narcisse paces again starting to sob and sniffle
boone leans back
barely audible between cries midian
boones eyes open like a shot
boone what did you say
narcisse i said shut up you want to ruin everything
boone leaps to his feet grabs and easily overpowers the smaller man
boone what did you say just now
narcisse suddenly friendly what did you say just now
boone you said midian
naricsse coyly did i
boone hurting him desperate what do you know about it
narcisse its where the monsters go
it takes away the pain
narcisse reaches his hands into his pockets then comes out with long silver razor sharp artificial nails curved like hooks attached to his thumbs
he holds them right at boones throat ready to cut
what do you know about it
boone pause cautiously they forgive you there
narcisse uh huh
ever kill anybody
narcisse see they only take you if youre worthy
you know what they do to those that arent worthy
boone shakes his head
narcisse draws one razor nail lightly across his own throat
a thin trickle of blood runs down his neck
boone its real
narcisse nods carefully and you know
where it is
we could go there
narcisse they sent you
they sent you to take me
boone thats right
but first i need to know
you have to tell me
where it is
narcisse its a test
boone nods narcisse leans in to him whispers no maps
boone but you do know
narcisse looks around leans in again north of athabasca
east of peace river
near shere neck north of dwyer
satisfied boone releases him go back to the bed collects his jacket
exhilarated youll take me with you im worthy you ask anyone i knew youd come they sent you to take me i was waiting
i know i know first i have to show you thats how it works
boone is looking out of the window in the door sizing up his escape
boone show me what
narcisse my true face
thats what there are for
he raises his bladed thumbs so you can see
im not a natural man
underneath im a monster thats how it works i show you then you take me with you
he puts the blade to either side of his face
we hear the skin pop
blood pours from narcisses face as he traces the outline of his face
dr decker whos just arrived with lieutenant joyce and two policemen is speaking with the doctor that examined boone
decker urgent showing boones file
he was an abandoned child raised by the state first diagnosis of incipient schizophrenia at thirteen juvenile delinquency periodically institutionalized through early adulthood
some violent episodes never criminally charged as an adult hes been in my care for less than a year
a bloodcurdling scream from the semi private room rivets the attention of the emergency room following the nurse and an intern as they burst into the room and are greeted
with the sight of narcisse blood running freely ripping the least of his scalp off his bare skull laughing and crying maniacally
boone stands near the door horrified
narcisse variously take me
im a monster
nurse over to boone what the hell have you done
intern fucking junkies
at the door yelling into the corridor doctor
as the door swings open boone looks out into the corridor and at the far end of the emergency room he sees decker and the cops looking his way
medical support move towards the room as the nurse and intern try to contain the ranting narcisse
boone grabs a loose doctors coat off the back of the door slips it on and backs out of the room
boone lets get some help in here
narcisse screams as a half dozen people struggle to subdue him
as help continues to rush into the room boone slowly backs away out and around a corner
he stops beside a swinging door sensing something
dr decker moving through emergency towards the melee stops on the other side of the swinging door his senses lit up with alarm
he slowly turns to the door
pushes it open
boone moves rapidly away from the exit into the parking lot tossing off the white coat breaking into a run
he tries several car doors finds one open gets in
with a rush of adrenal intensity boone expertly rips open an under panel of the dash locates and patches together the correct ignition wires and hot starts the car
closes the door
puts it in gear
boone slowly drives out of the lot trying not to attract the attention of the fleet of patrol cars sirens wailing pouring into the area
boone drives up an entrance ramp and onto the highway past a sign that reads dr decker a few policeman and medical personnel wait outside the door leading to the
semi private room
lieutenant joyce exits and a surgeon follows a moment later
decker whats he saying
joyce hes talking but hes not making any sense
something about a place called midian
surgeon hes dying
i think he wants to die
the surgeon moves on
decker unobtrusively to joyce lieutenant i know boone i know how he talks how he manipulates
perhaps if the right thing is said to this man itll trigger something
joyce consider no harm in trying
decker ill do my best
but ill need privacy
decker enters the room
looking in through the room we see decker cross the room to the bed where narcisse is lying
decker says something to the nurse
decker moves closer to the bed
he reaches into his pocket for something and moves out of our sight
montage boone drives through the night and the following day through a landscape which becomes increasingly more desolate
the road sign reads boones car speeds past
boones car rolls to a stop
boone steps out and looks at something in the dust
a battered sign
it reads there is no sign of life
in despair no
his shout echos
the wind blows up a cloud of dust around him
he walks through the dust on the verge of tears
the dust clears and he sees
necropolis lying on the other side of a thick expanse of reeds
puzzlement overtakes despair
he squints to see more clearly
the necropolis is vast
high walls surrounded by reeds with the tops of mausoleums showing above it
almost a fortressed town
boone starts towards it
the sun is low in the sky the light golden glinting off the gates
the reeds sigh
boone pushes one of the gates open and steps inside
his footsteps echo unnaturally loud in this city of the dead
to either side of him elegant and elaborate mausoleums running away into the distance with numerous smalls tombs set around and between them
the sun finally sinks out of sight
its final glow dies on the tops of the mausoleums
there are already stars overhead
boone walks on a little way as the night sounds begin
exhausted he sits down on a tomb and leans back against the stone
boone softly a bitter irony dead
all of the dead
he rummages for a cigarette in his jacket pocket
pulls one out
the flame seems to excite sounds around him
he looks up
the walkways are empty in both directions
theres a guttural sound at his back
he stands drops the cigarette backs away
from the darkness behind him steps a huge form
a knife is put to his lower belly
its wielder kinski is a massive man face distorted his features grotesquely bifurcated
kinski whispers move and i gut you
boone stays still
the growling from between the tombs becomes words
voice from the darkness you got him
kinski i got him
a reptilian hand reaches out and picks up boones dropped cigarette
are you from midian
kinski we should take him below peloquin
the silhouette of peloquin a were creature moves between the tombs
he draws on the cigarette
by its brightening point we glimpse an extraordinary face more animal than human but no recognizable species
peloquin hes not nightbreed
ive killed people im like you thats why im here
peloquin shut the fuck up
kinski if we eat him we break the law
boone my god
my god its true
peloquin of course its true
he starts to emerge from the shadows gods an astronaut
oz is over the rainbow
and midians where the monsters live
and you came to die
boone i didnt
didnt come to die
i came to be with you im one of you
peloquin reaches out and touches boones chest
i can smell innocence at fifty yards
boone ive killed people
peloquin who told you that
boone what do you mean
peloquin he lied asshole
youre a natural
and that means
youre meat for the beast
peloquin growls throwing his head back and forth with a strange grace the image flickering as he does so
boone watches amazed
in the blur of peloquins motion he transforms the tentacles on his head lengthening and thickening thrashing around as though they have a life of their own
he moves towards boone taking hold of him and tearing his t shirt open
kinski we mustnt
its the law
theyll exile us
peloquin fuck the law
i want meat
he bites boones neck tearing at his flesh
kinski peloquin no
kinski takes the knife from boones belly and pushes peloquin aside
boone slips away from them
peloquin damn you
he races after boone who runs blindly his hand pressed to the wound on his neck
the breed listen
we track running feet past the grille and move close into grille dropping through a dark rock face
in the deep darkness faces look up
the faces are strange and freakish
there is a woman locked in the embrace of a dark monster
a monstrous baby cries
boone takes refuge against a mausoleum wall
he takes his hand from the wound on his neck
it is throbbing like a living thing spreading across his muscle
he stares down at the wound then touches it lightly
it gives him pleasure
a sound above him
he looks up
peloquin is climbing down the mausoleum wall mouth opened wide to take off boones head
boone throws himself forward as the jaws snap shut missing him by inches
kinski appears in his path
for an instant boone thinks the games up
kinski that way
the gates that way
the monsters watch and listen
peloquin pushes kinski aside and pelts after boone who is at the gate
he flings himself through and slams it behind him
peloquin is at the gate when kinski comes up behind and restrains him
kinski hes gone give it up
you dont dare go out there
peloquin stares at boone through the gate
panting sweating boone stares back
snorting with frustration peloquin recedes he and kinski disappear into shadow
boone heaves a sigh of relief turns from the gate and trudges away into the darkness when suddenly
harsh lights hit boone from every side police cars in the reeds all around their searchlights focused on him
two dozen cops all levelling firearms
boone squints against the glare
aaron boone youre under arrest
hands on your head
boone takes a step back
the wound on his neck throbs and swells
at the edge of the light decker appears stepping towards him
decker boone listen to him its no use
joyce to decker stay back
decker lowers his voice lieutenant i can bring him out
hell listen to me
joyce ponders then signals him forward
decker advances toward boone
boone its all right ive explained everything to them
rifles are cocked on every side
decker stops a safe distance from boone
they wont harm you i give you my word
boone hanging back i didnt do it
i didnt hurt anyone
decker lowering his voice of course you didnt
you believe me
decker you wouldnt hurt a fly
extends a hand come on boone
its safe ive seen to that
boone taking a tentative step forward what what about the pills
decker pause whispers what about them boone
boone they werent tranquillizers
a look of alarm crosses deckers face
boone reads it
he gets the picture
you set me up
you bastard you set me up
he lunges for decker who turns and throws himself to the ground as he yells
decker hes got a gun
the bullets fly
boone is about to pounce on decker when hes hit by a barrage thrown back riddled with bullets
on the ground decker covers his head
boone goes down
the volley ends
the sound of gunfire echoes through the walkways
in the shadows a baby held in the arms of a woman with monstrous but beautiful features begins to cry
joyce hears the sound of crying and looks up
boones body lies on the ground
decker rises hearing the distant sobs on the wind
the mother hushes the child her arms which are tentacles wrapping around it
the sound of crying is lost
joyce moves forward towards decker and boone
joyce trying to convince himself
just the wind
he reaches decker looks down at boones body
wheres the gun
decker seemingly dismayed he reached into his jacket
i thought i saw it i swear
oh god boone
joyce quietly to some cops meaning boone get him outta here
we track towards a tomb on which the epitaph reads god is merciful moving with lori flanked by dr burton the pathologist and a grim joyce
they enter a smaller room
burton flips a switch
curtains part in front of a thick glass panel revealing a small sterile viewing chamber
in the chamber are a morgue attendant and lying on a stainless steel table boones body
lori looks at the body with heartbreaking sadness
burton closes the curtains
lori and joyce exit
on the other side of the glass the attendant rolls boone on the table towards a door marked pathology
dr decker sits alone looking into his briefcase
the door opens lori and joyce enter
decker closes the briefcase rises aggrieved takes both of loris hands in his speaks soothingly
decker lori im dr decker
boone was my patient
decker im so sorry for your loss
i must tell you you meant the world to aaron
he spoke of you constantly
lori withdrawing her hand has the creeps thank you doctor
lori sits across a table from joyce
decker sits against the wall
joyce miss winston are you sure you wouldnt rather postpone
lets get it over with
joyce turns on a tape recorder on the table
joyce starting at the beginning what was your relationship with aaron boone
lori pause we were lovers
we move in on the revolving reels of the tape recorder
joyce how long had you known aaron boone
lori two months
burton and the attendant instruments laid out boones body on a brightly lit steel table ready for the autopsy
burton activates an overhead microphone
burton deceased is a white caucasian male late twenties
suspected cause of death multiple gunshot wounds to the thoracic cavity and extremities
the attendant lifts up boones jacket
light streams through many bullet holes
they werent takin any chances
burton picks up a small digging tool and zeroes in on one of the chest wounds
burton wound number one entered between the fourth and fifth left ribs impacted the lower rib lodging in ligaments adjacent to the left lung
joyce so he never gave any indication
joyce surely there must have been something
lori firm angry look you can say whatever you want to about him
i dont believe it
he never raised a hand to me he never harmed anyone in his life
a strained silence
decker drums his fingers on his briefcase
decker miss winston everyone has their secret faces
lori drop dead
annoyed at decker joyce turns off the tape recorder
joyce well continue this some other time
lori stands and heads for the door
a pair of callipers drop a distended bullet into a steel bowl containing at least ten other similarly maimed bullets
fatigued with effort burton wipes his forehead turns off the microphone
burton coffee break
the attendant turns off the bright overheads he and burton move into an adjoining lounge
lori is putting on her coat
a contrite decker approaches her
decker miss winston i hope you didnt misinterpret what i said
boone meant a great deal to me
lori where did he die
pause what was the name of the town
decker a place called midian
the bowl wobbles on the ground
the bullets roll off in different directions
sound of glass breaking
hearing the breaking glass lori and decker turn back towards the autopsy room
she runs towards the sound decker follows
in slow motion a large first floor window shatters out towards us
as lori then decker enter moments after burton joyce and the attendant
the autopsy table is empty
burton someones taken him
decker my god
attendant looking around wheres his coat
slow motion distorting time we see the rest of the shattering window and a dim figure crosses the moon
lori hurriedly throws some belongings into a suitcase
we see some newspaper clippings beside the suitcase
a headline reads slasher another features a map showing the location of midian
montage lori drives at high speed down the same roads boone took previously
at sunset lori enters the town past a sign that reads welcome to lori pulls into the parking lot of the motel
a neon sign reads above it the moon
from the motel itself sounds of revelry
a wood panelled western frontier themed bar
a banner welcomes rodeo participants
a number of rough types clustered at tables many of them wearing baseball caps adorned with buffalo horns
lori enters looks around
a cowboy lassoes a waitress ropes her in to general applause
lori takes a seat at the bar and is approached by a bartender
bartender whatll it be darlin

bartender taps a stein of draft theres the draft
lori lays down a bill im looking for a town called midian

loris hit with a burst of emotion
she doesnt want the bartender to see her cry
lori wheres the bathroom
bartender right around the corner there darlin
lori rises exits
lori enters and leans on the sink as the grief hits her
a stall door opens behind her sheryl a girl in her early twenties exits
lori pulls a tissue from her bag and tries to compose herself standing back to allow sheryl access to the mirror where she studied herself before starting to tease her
sheryl which is it hon men or money
lori looks at her its usually one or the other aint it
a tiny smile
sheryl uh huh

lori smiles squeezes her hand exits the bar
sheryl looks around finishes her drink
the bartender sets another drink down in front of her
bartender courtesy of that gent in the suit at the end of the bar
sheryl looks down the bar sees the man seems impressed waves
sheryl low to the bartender isnt he just the picture of sophistication though
we cut to a wide shot of the necropolis by night
a shooting star falls
now we move in on one of the mausoleums and from the ground below we hear a ritualistic chanting
once within the darkness of the mausoleum the camera slides down over the rock face into the depths of midian
the volume of the chanting increases as we come close to its source
we come into the mural chamber the camera passing down over the family tree of naturals and nightbreed and round to see rachel and kinski approaching and entering the door
of the initiation chamber
cut to narcisse and boone also approaching the chamber
narcisse youll like this
its just their way of welcoming you to the club
boone im not sure i want to be a member
narcisse you made your way back here for the same reasons i did
we belong here now
theres nowhere else on earth would take us in
in the middle of the chamber is a kind of font on which stands a bowl of baphomets blood steaming and bubbling
standing in front of it is lylesburg
to his side peloquin
beside him rachel
on lylesburgs other side ohnaka
standing around the walls as witnesses to the ceremony are a variety of breed
the breed all look his way
boone sees shuna sassi
boone to narcisse in a whisper who is she
narcisse shuna sassi
boone i dreamt her
shuna leans towards peloquin
shuna sassi ive dreamt him
narcisse nudges boone forward
lylesburg who is your advocate
narcisse i am
lylesburg have you tutored him in the law
boone yes he has
lylesburg let the advocate answer
narcisse yes i have
lylesburg you understand what you do becoming one of us
with this night you turn your back on the natural world
the life you lived will after this be as a dream
boone i know
lylesburg takes the glove off his right hand
the flesh beneath is cauterized
lylesburg the blood of the god tells all truths
it can harm as easily as heal
are you prepared to be judged
boone im ready
lylesburg nods and puts his hand into the bowl of the blood
the blood bubbles around his wrist
we cut to peloquin and shuna sassi who are watching boone intently
boones eyes are now on lylesburgs smoking hand as it approaches boones chest still marked by his wounds
lylesburg be judged
he puts his hand on the bullet wounds
but theres no pain
when lylesburgs hand is removed the wounds have gone
theres a visible release of tension on the faces of all those watching
lylesburg aaron boone in the name of baphomet lord of the tribes of the moon i bid you welcome
the camera moves out of the chamber and towards the mural
lori lies awake in bed staring at the ceiling
outside and next door the noise of laughter and partying
lori quietly a tear in her eye i still love you boone
sheryl is sitting at the empty bar obviously hung over
she is wearing dark glasses and a horned buffalo days hat
the bartender pours her an eye opener
bartender hair of the dog
lori hows your head
sheryl my momma always used to say sheryl ann theres a man out walking around with your name on his mind all you got to do is run into him
lori and he just happened to be checked in here at the crossroads of the world
sheryl isnt that something
his name is curtis he is a banker recently divorced and recently relocated in edmonton up for the rodeo and better yet he thinks i am the queen bees knees
lori sheryl you sure you want to come along
sheryl wouldnt miss it
besides curtis has to do business today weve got an engagement for this evening and if i sit around all day with this head on im gonna feel like the
hind end of a dog sled
lori im glad for your company
sheryl now if we could just make a quick stop for some alka seltzer
loris car comes to a stop near the edge of the reeds outside the necropolis
looks like the gold rush is over
lori parks the car
she gets out looks around
lori quiet reflective why
why would boone come here
sheryl to get away from it all
lori gives her a look shut up sheryl ann
you go do what you have to do
ill stay here and
do somethin else
lori nods and heads away down the street leaving sheryl beside the car
she leans against the car surveys the emptiness without enthusiasm
my luck ill end up buying some real estate
lori as she leaves the reeds and sees the outer walls of the necropolis
lori good god
sheryl wandering from the car into the reeds
she lights a cigarette tunelessly humming to ward off the willies
she stops shivers suddenly feeling very isolated
the atmospheres got to her
she starts back to the car
she catches some movement out of the corner of her eye
slowly walks away from the movement fighting off panic
she turns a corner and realizes shes lost in the reeds
she hears movement behind her turns startled then oddly she smiles
what are you doing here
its decker looking like a commuter hair slicked back wearing an overcoat carrying his briefcase
decker big smile hello sheryl ann
lori reaches the gates slightly breathless
she pushes one of them open
the sun is hot and bright transforming the necropolis from the dark dangerous place it was when boone was here
now with its gothic tombs and burgeoning plant life its almost welcoming
lori wanders the walkways enchanted by the splendor of the place
there are strange bittersweet sights along the way statues of dogs sleeping on their masters graves of mourning mothers of children sitting at their graves
and grotesque images too gargoyles protecting the doorways of mausoleums a tiger roaring in stone
it is another world solemn and silent
suddenly the sound of an animal in pain
lori stops and looks around
her gaze comes to rest on a spreading laurel tree beneath which the shadows are pitch black
from here the sobbing comes
there is an animal beneath the tree barely discernible
she can see its flanks panting its head moving in pain
it doesnt look like a recognizable species an amalgam of wild cat and deer
it raises its head weakly
its eyes are huge and black
its okay i wont hurt you
the creature shudders
whats happened to you
let me see
she reaches beneath the branches and tentatively strokes the animal
it responds by dropping its head back on to the grass
you poor thing
dont die please dont die
she pushes beneath the tree puts her arms beneath the creature and picks it up
it is heavy a dead weight in her arms
she backs out from beneath the tree
as she steps back into the sun the creature snarls and starts to wither in her arms
she realizes whats causing it pain and steps back into shadow
you dont like the sun
is that it
the sound of sobbing off to her left draws her attention
one of the mausoleum doors is open and a woman rachel dressed in black stands in the shadows weeping
is is it yours
rachel bring her
bring her please
shading the creature from the sun lori moves to the door and steps into the gloom
the interior is marble the air murky
rachel a fine boned pre raphaelite beauty in her thirties moves back against the far wall nursing a wounded arm
lori looks down at the creature shes carrying utterly limp in her arms
im afraid its too late
she cant die
bring her to me please
rachel reaches out
loris reluctant to move further into the darkness
as lori crosses the floor she hears whispering from a stairway that leads down into the earth
she stops frightened
rachel pay no attention
please bring me my babette
as the creature is named it starts to move in loris arms
not only move but change
its claws grab at loris breast as it writhes
lori whats happening
rachel dont look
but lori cant help but look
appalled she tries to pull the transforming creature off her but its hold is firm
with effort she detaches the creatures claws from her almost throwing it at rachel who cradles the changing creature in her arms
lori leans against the wall trying to wipe the sticky fluids the creatures exuded onto her hands
when she looks up she sees the creature in rachels arms has transformed into a pale beautiful girl of seven or eight
rachel she likes to play outside
i tell her you mustnt play in the sun
the sun will hurt you
but shes just a child
she doesnt understand
lori looks back towards the open door and the sun drenched walkway outside
then back at babette
lori this is too weird
rachel an urgent whisper you saved her
i owe you something
listen i know why you came here
lori you do
rachel you must go this place is not for you
midian is a home for the nightbreed
only for the nightbreed
lori is boone here
did somebody bring him here
a deep baritone voice rises up from the shadows of the stairwell
you have said too much already
lylesburg appears a commanding magisterial man with a vast grey beard and three slits on each cheek that look like gills
loping along beside him his fool a muscular man with an innocently beautiful face ohnaka
rachel my lylesburg she brought me babette she saved her
lylesburg we know
but you cannot help her
lori her spunk surfacing look i saved the childs life dont i deserve something for that
lylesburg the child has no life to save he looks at her sizes her up but what she has is yours if you want it
thats the law
do you want her
i just want some answers
lylesburg you werent meant to see this
lori i kind of got that impression
lylesburg then you also understand that to speak of this to anyone will bring dire consequences
lori hey pal dont threaten me
lylesburg not for you
his words take the edge off loris anger
she notices that inscribed in the marble arch above the doorway are the words lylesburg cont
whats below remains below
this is the law
rachel is carrying babette down the steps
lylesburg turns to follow her
wait a minute
boone aaron boone just tell me is he here
you took him you took his body didnt you
lori crosses to the stairs
lylesburgs disappeared down into the darkness
talk to me damn it i have to know come back
lori heads down the stairs
lori come back
lylesburg ohnaka rachel and babette have gone however
lori continues her descent
there are sounds in the darkness below her
she stops and looks back towards the top of the stairs
its a long way off
lori to herself how deep does this go
she heads on down turning a corner
in front of her peloquin
he starts towards her
she backs away into a second creature and starts up the stairs
as she does so a third creature swings down from the darkness above her head
she shrieks and runs like hell
peloquin calls after her come back soon yhear
lori emerges squinting against the blinding sun trying to calm herself
walk away lori
theres got to be a perfectly reasonable explanation cant sustain it and hell if i know what it is
she sprints back towards the gate
out of breath lori reaches the car parked where she left it
no sign of sheryl
lets get the hell out of here
no reply sheryl
lori looks around
sees sheryls purse in the dirt near the reeds
she moves towards the reeds
picks up the purse
peers inside the house
she hears a gurgling laugh from inside
it could be sheryl
sheryl come on
the undergrowth is dark and empty
lori advances cautiously through the paths
lori sheryl we have to go uh somethings kind of come up and
she sees a splash of blood on the reeds
something moves across our field of vision in the gloom behind her
she turns back and follows the trail of blood around the corner lying on the floor is sheryl
mouth cut away
tongue cut off
she turns to run but decker steps into her path
he wears a mask of repulsive simplicity a linen face with two buttons for eyes and a zipper open at present for a mouth
in his hands are two large carving knives both blood stained
decker lets get it over with shall we
lori mind racing a survivor take it easy lets talk about this
decker advancing dont try and reason with me lori
im a lunatic
you dont reason with lunatics
lori how do you know my name
decker good question
no reason why you shouldnt have an answer
he pulls off the mask wish i had a camera
oh the look a your face
why did you kill her
decker why did i kill all the others
for the fun of it of course
everyone ought to have a hobby dont you agree
lori boone was innocent
decker is innocent wherever hes hiding
after all the trouble i went to to find him a home for his guilt
lori you sick motherfucker
decker boones alive lori
and your death is going to bring him out of hiding
he comes at her suddenly but his heel slides in sheryls blood
he falls in front of lori and stabs at her feet
she avoids the stab by an inch
he rises suddenly throws one of his knives aside and grabs the blade lori holds with a glove which strikes sparks
it is chainmail
lori lets go propelling herself through the reeds
the light is diminishing behind the necropolis walls
loris screams are distant
we track towards the gate as she runs down the hill
lori somebody help me
she flings the gate open and enters
decker emerges from the reeds behind her
the temple is an impressive chamber at the centre of which is a dais ringed with representatives of the six failed saviours of breed
in the middle of the ring a statue of baphomet
there are benches along the walls
sitting in them reciting in soft sibilant voices the laws of midian are breed
lylesburg accompanied by ohnaka is also in the chamber as is boone being held by the breed
boone i have to help her
lylesburg you cant go
boone ill kill him
no one will ever know
lylesburg whats below remains below
boone i cant let her die
lylesburg when we took you in you made an oath to obey the law
boone i wont listen to him butcher her
i love her
lylesburg shes a natural
she couldnt love you back
he starts to struggle against his captors fighting them off
boone youre wrong
throwing one back and punching the other boone breaks for the door
lylesburgs shout is ignored as boone heads up to the surface
lori runs down the walkways pursued by decker her breath coming in gasps close to collapse
lori help me
oh please god somebody
decker reaches her and pulls on his mask
decker thats good
its quicker that way
he pulls a particularly nasty blade from his jacket interior and advances
she rises and tries to duck the cut
he strikes her with the back of his hand
she falls striking her head on a tomb
sudden fury i said be still
lori is semi conscious blood running from her wounded head
looking past decker she sees something
then he realizes shes reacting to the appearance of boone standing in the shadows behind him in jeans and leather jacket
lori slips into unconsciousness
boone isnt this where the dead are supposed to go
decker youre not dead
boone advancing youre wrong
were both dead decker
decker im not decker
isnt that you dr decker hiding behind that childs mask
decker im not hiding
boone still advancing taunting him decker decker
enraged decker throws the knife it buries in the middle of boones chest
decker laughs then stops as boone pulls the knife out and tosses it aside
blades are no better than bullets decker dont you get it
the walking dead
decker thats not possible
decker turns to run but boone races to him catches turns him and pulls decker closer until theyre nose to nose
boone not just dead
want me to show you
decker whimpering no please
boone not your kind of monster
not the soulless kind
ive got midian in my veins
he tears off the mask uncovering deckers sweaty terrified face
decker please please its its not my fault its the mask it makes me do things i dont want to
boone pulls him closer boone it was the mask and they were going to find me punish me i needed a scapegoat
boone you chose the wrong man
you call yourself a man
boone looks round narcisse is squatting on a tomb his face a mass of scar tissue
youre no more man than i am
boone monster then
narcisse thats more like it
he jumps off the tomb moves towards them well go on are you going to kill him or not
only i want his balls
and his eyes
that is if you dont want them
boone ill pass
narcisse remember me doctor
i was dying when you had your way with me
you made me tell my secrets when i was feeling particularly vulnerable
now was that a nice thing for a doctor to do
decker to boone craven oh god boone dont let him touch me anything keep him off me full confession
sweet jesus mercy mercy please im begging you
narcisse raises his thumbs still bearing their silver hooks
narcisse lets start with his eyes
boone pushes narcisse back but as he does so decker slips his grasp
boone roars and starts to twitch and stamp as peloquin did and we watch as
boone transforms into something part man part carnivore
and gives chase
decker nears the gate but boone is after him at great speed leaping over tombs like a high jumper
left behind narcisse turns his eyes upon the recumbent lori
narcisse filled with hunger greatly consoled well
as he advances on her loris eyes flicker open
boone right on deckers tail he hears loris screams and stops
decker runs out through the gate
boone starts back towards lori
lori struggling in narcisses arms
he tries to muffle her
boone leaps tombs nearing their location
he bounds into the clearing sees lori unconscious in narcisses embrace
boone let her go
narcisse all sheepish co operation gently lets her go onto the ground
keeping her warm
boone is almost human now
he reaches lori
i wouldnt have touched her
boone breathes in the last of his monstrous condition and bends to tenderly stroke loris face
then very lightly he kisses her and gathers her in his arms
boone i had no choice
lylesburg youve put us all in danger for your love of this woman
boone decker cant tell anyone
whats he going to say
that he tried to kill a girl and a dead man stopped him
lylesburg he can still lead our enemies here
if he goes if midians unearthed youre responsible
boone so let me make amends
lylesburg just take the girl and go on your way amongst the naturals
thats the law
boone who made this law
the god in obsidian
who made midian
boone so maybe i should speak to this guy
lylesburg baphomet is a spirit in stone
he doesnt speak or move
his wounds are too great
boone what are you afraid of
lylesburg what baphomet made he has the power to unmake
his blood is volatile
he mustnt be angered
boone then ill make nice
boone heads down the corridor
he slows as he passes an entrance to one side chamber and looks in
inside the chamber a dog faced man is working on a vast elaborate mosaic mural that extends into shadow in both directions
he looks up and locks eyes with boone
boone breaks off the contact and continues down the corridor
the dog faced man turns back to his palette a multi coloured collection of small tiles
he carefully selects a few then turns to the mosaic and we see
the mosaic mural
prominent in what appears to be a panoramic visual history of the nightbreed race is a heroic figure who closely resembles
the dog faced man applies the tiles hes selected filling in the irises of the boone figures eyes
lori sits up
her head aches
babette goes to her aid
babette be still
it was a bad hurt he did us
what do you mean us
rachel moving to them you held babette while she transformed
shes made quite a bond with you
babette i felt your hurt
i still feel it
rachel she even knew you were coming here
she saw it all through your eyes
babette and you can see through mine
lori pause she tries to read rachel youre not kidding
rachel its true
lori rises unsteadily to her feet
babette takes her hand but rachel moves her away from lori
she doesnt want you to touch her sweet
lori you got that right
one minute im about to get carved like a christmas turkey the next im
a surfacing memory breaks her train
it was boone
boone saved me
lori but hes dead i saw him in the morgue
rachel you still dont understand do you
lori wait a second back up
rachel youre below now
with the nightbreed
the last survivors of the great tribes
lori tribes of who
rachel were shapeshifters freaks remains of races your species have almost driven to extinction
lori so youre not immortal
rachel far from it
the sun can kill some of us
she follows her father in that
some of us could be shot down others would survive that because theyve got beyond death
its all horrible
rachel to be able to fly
to be smoke or a wolf to know the night and live in it forever
thats not so bad
you call us monsters but when you dream its of flying and changing and living without death
you envy us
and what you envy
lori softly understanding
rachel to babette show her
show her the past
babette touches loris arm
babette be with me
the skulls in front of lori fill her sight
we fly through one of the eye sockets into
fade through from the skull chamber into grinning people running towards partially constructed bonfires
the people throw tinder onto the fires
we track off the fire building to a wall behind where frightened monsters hide
the shadow of a cross falls on them
inquisitors in black robes part to reveal the head inquisitor in purple robes
he reads the charges
head inquisitor thou shalt not suffer a monster to live
frightened monsters pulled away from the wall
inquisitors step aside to show torture scenes
we track through the tortures racks crucifixion floggings a hanging
the camera moves off gallows past a wall to flags
we cut close on the flag which reads freak show track past the flag to a cage containing freakish breed
well dressed ordinary men and women applaud and laugh
one of the freaks is dragged from the cages
he looks back at the family hes left behind
the inquisitor reads their charges as the bonfire awaits
the victim is thrown onto the bonfire
a tinder flares and the inquisitors and audience light cigarettes and cigars from the tinder
the bonfire then flares up
an inquisitor lasciviously strokes the naked buttocks of a beautiful girl
she turns towards us in despair we see her head is bestial
overwhelmed with horror lori opens her eyes breaking her connection with babette
rachel we are all that remain
and youre saying
boones like you
rachel he is nightbreed
or he was until he broke the law
lori moving towards the door no no thats not possible ive got to find him theres been some kind of mistake
babette dont go
lori but he didnt kill anybody it wasnt him hes innocent
rachel that no longer matters
lori where is he
whered he go
rachel down to the tabernacle to baphomet
rachel the baptiser
who made midian
who called us here and saved us from our enemies
lori take me there ive got to find boone
rachel its forbidden
lori well see about that
decker is drinking coffee
a cop strides by

decker hes not dead

thats nuthouse talk
joyce talk about what
decker midians not empty
theres something breeding there
below the cemetery
joyce to decker do you believe that
decker yes i do
and if you dont stop them theres going to be more bloodshed
lori finds herself in a cavernous space lined with chambers connected by walkways and ladders which dont look particularly secure
she moves out on to a walkway
it leads her into the central core of midian which offers a view of dizzying descent into the earth
she scans the scene amazed by the sheer scale of the place
lori my god
as she descends into the bowels of midian creatures in various doorways watch her with curiosity
one creature seems to have light running from wounds on its body
another tumbles past her a slow acrobat defying gravity
she sees only a few of these but hears far more chattering and murmuring in the shadows
as lori moves through the chambers toward peloquin we see the devil creature lude feeding snakes to his pet a horned many legged beast which squats on the floor
he gets up and goes to look at her
leroy a grinning grotesque appears from the back of the chamber snatches the snake from the maw of the pet and comes to watch as well
leroy eating the snake there goes the neighbourhood
lori looks into a chamber
a dark winged figure moves aside to reveal
a ceremony with the bowls of white blood later seen in baphomets chamber is in progress
as lori crosses the bridge something watches from the deep shadows
the tone darkens
she steps off the bridge and scorpions scuttle away
lori is now a little nervous
she finds herself in a corner with several doors
through one door she sees a man with a white t shirt
she calls after him
lori enters through the door
in a corner a ghastly meal is underway
the boone figure is heading away through another door
lori follows the figure and the diners get up as if to attack
in the next chamber is a tangle of bright red glistening bodies with no heads
lori glances round
the diners pursue her
up ahead of lori is the boone figure
she approaches it as it steps out of the shadows
it is not boone
she steps away
the red beast is rising behind her
lori turns and exits the chamber flattening herself against the rock
crouched in a niche above where shes walking we see a small lizard like creature barabas eating a dead rat
lori enters the final chamber following the figure she thinks is boone
on the far side crouching at a door a figure
the figure turns
peloquin no one here of that name
the boone figure is in the doorway behind her
he has the face of a snake
peloquin told you
he approaches lori
peloquin i know you
he talks about you
he snatches a broach from her
youre still a natural
want to join the family
he goes to bite her lori no
peloquin follows her to the door
peloquin at door you will
sooner or later youll want to live forever
he laughs maniacally returning into his room
lori continues her descent
as she nears the cavern floor lylesburg steps into her path beside him his fool ohnaka
lylesburg you may go no further
lori i want boone
lylesburg youre not to blame but you must understand what boones done has put us in jeopardy
lori no problem you tell me where he is and were outta here
lylesburg boone has gone to baphomet
he is beyond recall
a low rumbling issues from somewhere deep inside the passage lylesburg stands before
underneath the rumble is an animal moaning with pain
lori where is he
hes down here isnt he
you want to stop me youre gonna have to kill me
impressed by her resolve lylesburg stands aside
she moves past him and heads down into the chamber towards a distant light
lylesburg gestures after her
ohnaka nods and follows
lori heads through a room which leads towards the berserkers
the reassuring sounds of the core fade behind her
she slows her advance
suddenly narcisse steps from the shadows
narcisse up and about already
lori keep away from me
narcisse im sorry about upstairs
i see a pretty face and i want to kiss it
lori moves on past dont go down there
lori why not
narcisse instant change of subject dont you just love this place
shangri la on dope
i love it
lori whats that smell
narcisse sniffs his armpits not me
they keep the berserkers down there
theyll rip your head off and shit down your neck
lori boone went this way right
narcisse and wont be coming back
lori ill bring him
narcisse you think love can raise the dead
lori hes not dead
narcisse hes that and more
if you dont believe me you wait til he gets to sniff a little blood
thatll bring out the beast in him
im telling you dont go
lori i have to
nothing makes any sense without him
who needs it
lori moves off down the corridor
ohnaka follows her
narcisse to ohnaka love those tattoos
lori starts down the corridor the walls of which are cracked wide in places the gaps covered with chains
from the other side she hears grunts and growls
then to her shock one of the berserkers arms reaches up from a grille in the floor and snatches at her leg
she steps aside to avoid it and another of the berserkers arms reaches through the mesh of chains taking hold of her by the neck
it starts to choke her
she shouts for help
ohnaka lylesburgs fool appears from down the corridor
he starts to rattle the chains further along the wall
ohnaka hey ghost
come and get me
come and get me
the arm around loris neck releases its hold and we hear the sound of the creatures moving along the walls in ohnakas direction
ohnaka fat asses
suddenly arms reach for him through the chains
he steps away just in time
he grins at lori proud of himself
lori wheres boone
ohnaka this way
he starts to lead her towards baphomets chamber
ohnaka and lori reach the next to last chamber a roaring from below down a slope in front of them walls vibrating with the din from baphomets chamber
blindingly bright light out of which lori spots a figure climbing towards them
she moves down to boone scrambling up the slope towards her drenched in sweat half mad with terror
he reaches for her then collapses
she starts down the slope to him
dust falls from the roof the din makes her reel
but she reaches him starts to haul him to his feet
then she looks up and we get a glimpse of
out of the blinding light and seemingly the source of it a huge black figure turns towards her twelve feet high severed limbs connected by sinews of hot white energy
and extruded spines the face terrible wise and beautiful
loris stunned she averts her eyes
boone collects himself enough to pull her away and they help each other frantically scrabble up the slope out of the chamber
as lori and boone emerge ohnaka appears and beckons them to follow
too exhausted and frightened to speak boone and lori follow
ominous rumblings urge them on as boone and lori make a stumbling ascent through the core trailing ohnakas urgent lead watched from the doorways by a variety of creatures
we cut to the ledge and move to a chamber where peloquin and shuna sassi are making love
peloquin hears lori urging boone on as they struggle across the bridge and looks away from shuna out through the door
peloquin well well
he goes to the door
guess he couldnt take the heat
shuna sassi i dreamt him
peloquin thats only because the bite was mine
shuna sassi no dont you see
hes the one from the prophesies
the seventh saviour
peloquin so whys he leaving
shuna sassi everything has its purpose
maybe he hasnt learned to hate his tribe enough
hell be back
peloquin kisses her
peloquin why die waiting
the sun climbs over the horizon sunlight penetrates the graveyard
a mausoleum door creaks open lori and boone rush out into the open air
lori tries to lead boone away he squints painfully against the early light
boone no no i belong here
lori grabs him bullshit
boone boone listen to me you belong with me thats why you lived thats why we survived because we belong together
ohnaka swings the door shut behind them
boone sees lori as if for the first time
she takes his hand presses it to her face her breast
this is me
this is why i followed you this is what were living for
his eyes clear
a part of him seems to return
he embraces her
lori they dont need you
nobody needs you but me
well go away far away where no one will ever find us
i love you
they hold each other
boone and lori two small figures alone among the sepulchres
they move towards the gate together
loris car pulls into the parking lot
lori turns to boone slumped down in the passenger seat out of sight wearing sunglasses
lori ill get my stuff ill be back in two minutes
boone dont leave me alone
boone fiercely no
lori calmly trying to hide her alarm okay
well go in together
she hands him the buffalo days hat and opens the door
from a phone booth across the street we see lori and boone move towards the motel entrance
in foreground a chain mailed hand picks up the phone and dials
boone and lori enter the corridor that leads to her room
eerie silence save for a dog yapping somewhere
alarmed she turns to him
lori whispers whats wrong
boone why is it so empty
lori they must be at the rodeo
she hurries on boone follows clearly disturbed
lori unlocks her door glancing back at boone who has taken off his sunglasses
there is something strange about the light in his eyes
a subtle wave of colour passes across his face
boone i smell blood
boone so much blood
she swings the door open
we expect a horror
an ordinary room
lori its okay
lori enters and quickly gathers her belongings together
boone sweating with terror slides down the wall into a squatting position
as lori packs she looks down sees a hole in the wall the result of some massive violence from the other side
she cautiously leans down peers through the hole and quickly retreats hand over mouth horrified by what shes seen
boone appears at the door
boone goes next door and turns the handle
boone pushes the door open
inside a massacre five dead card players propped up around a poker table in a sick parody of a poker game tableau throats slit buffalo hats on their heads
sitting in the middle of the table a tall elaborate house of cards
boone moves into the middle of the room
on his face we can see the hunger he feels
ripples of color begin to move over his features
he moves towards the corpses
as he does so we hear a nearly deafening sound from outside
the vibrations knock over the house of cards and
into the empty street a helicopter descends discharging lieutenant joyce and a platoon of heavily armed swat team cops
local police cars pour in
captain eigerman climbs out of his cruiser to survey the siege
decker introduces him to joyce
sharpshooters take up positions training their weapons on the motel as the swat team moves in
lori moves to the door of the murder room
boone is inside his back to her
lori it was decker
decker did this
in foreground boones face begins to transform which lori cant see
she hears the cops outside
boone we have to get out of here
boone stay away from me
lori boone what is it
boone i dont want you to see
lori see what
boone get out
do as i say
lori i wont leave you
as she crosses towards him he turns
his face is in mid transformation
loris scream echoes outside the motel
joyce orders in the swat team
they charge entering the motel
lori backs out of the room in horror
lori oh my god
oh my god
she hears cops charging up the stairs
the transformed boone covers his face slams the room door shut and moves towards the bodies
lori hides at the end of the corridor as the swat cops appear at the far end
on his knees in the middle of some frenzied action we cant quite see boone stops and looks down at his blood stained hands
out of sight lori watches the cops prepare to storm the room
boone enters the bathroom with the sound of the swat teams entry to the motel on the track
he slams the door
there is blood on his face and hands
he goes to the sink and turns on the tap
then he sees himself in the mirror his transformed face is a shock he looks at himself appalled
then a wave of nausea overtakes him
he throws up into the sink a splash of blood and flesh hes just eaten
wiping his mouth with the back of his hands he starts to breathe out his condition
his face transforms back to his normal state
he makes a sob of horror
swat leader v
boone looks towards the door sinking down against the tiles as he does so
the door is flung open
we see him cowering as the swat team come for him
under cover of the trees and cars around the motel lori hides in a place where she can view the front of the building
she sees eigerman talking with joyce decker behind them
they look up as the swat cops manhandle a hand cuffed boone out of the building
he has totally reverted to human form the blood stains seemingly a sure proof of guilt
lori watches as hes thrown into a police car and driven off
a clank of keys opening locks
a steel door swings open
three cops rough house boone down the corridor eigerman right behind passing other cells holding prisoners watching them go by
we hold on one a young fundamentalist baptist preacher reverend ashberry
he has haunted maniacally repressed eyes and the ragged look of a habitual drunk
boone is thrown into the cell
eigerman and the three cops labowitz sergeant pettine and gibbs all practised hard guys enter the cell after him
eigerman fuckin freak
to his men stand him up
they haul boone to his feet
eigerman hits boone with a wicked blackjack
you picked the wrong town boy
we believe in real justice here a blow is delivered theyre gonna take you back to the city
but were gonna leave you with something
boone sags to the ground unconscious
as the sound of boone being beaten up filters through the wall ashberry sits in his cell bible in hand
he flicks the pages over attempting to distance himself from the violence he hears with study
he halts at a page with an illustration
it is something from revelations monsters and demons doing battle with angels
he puts the book down and turns over his palm
it is a mass of tiny scars
he closes his hand into a white knuckled fist retreating into the shadows in the corner of his cell
we cutback to his hand
blood seeps between the fingers as his nails dig into the meat of his palm
decker is standing looking at eigermans collection of photographs
eigerman you still here
decker im going back to midian with you
eigerman im not going anywhere
we got press folks and photographers coming in from all over
wouldnt be polite to keep em waiting
eigerman starts to exit again
joyce is in the doorway
eigerman tell him
we got our man under lock and key
decker dont trust him
ive seen him
eigerman ill keep an eye out
joyce he was right about the motel
joyce so maybe there are more of them
i dont know
eigerman you want to take some of the boys take em pettine
pettine yes sir eigerman you tommy and gibbs take the inspector out to the cemetery

i got photographers wanting me
badly beaten boone lies in the corner stirring when he hears the door unlocked
labowitz ushers in a middle aged small town physician doctor rose
labowitz doctors here to examine you freak
just so nobody can say we laid a finger on you
he winks at rose looks okay to me what do you think doc
boone painfully pulls himself upright
looks up at dr rose who slips on his stethoscope listens to boones chest
he moves it listens moves it again alarmed
he takes boones wrist feels around
boone stares at him
dr rose clears his throat rises moves to labowitz at the door and speaks quietly
dr rose no pulse
labowitz whats that
dr rose no
a crowd of journalists and on lookers mill outside the station
we find lori following her through the crowd as she tries to get a view of the building
as she watches joyce and his three cop escort climb into two police cars and drive off
an impromptu press conference with eigerman centre stage standing at a table laced with tape recorders and microphones
behind him a map of the town with coloured pins and a blackboard drawing of the sweetgrass inn including a diagram of where the bodies were found
eigerman adores the attention
eigerman yes he may have had accomplices but i cant reveal the precise source of my information on that
st reporter local source captain
eigerman a glance at decker in the crowd not sos youd notice
nd reporter has boone made a confession
eigerman we found him with a piece of human flesh in his mouth
hows that for guilty
cameras flash furiously
we see labowitz leading dr rose through the crowd to the podium
labowitz reaches eigerman and whispers in his ear
eigerman makes him repeat it
his brow knits in puzzlement
he turns to the press and smiles
scuse me folks wont be a second
eigerman points a beckoning finger at decker who follows him into his office along with labowitz and dr rose
eigerman closes the door and turns to decker
eigerman just exactly how many bullets did they put into this geek up at midian
dr rose severely shaken half of them are still in him
in fact hes riddled with them
decker as i told you these arent ordinary people
youre saying he should be dead
dr rose no im saying he is dead
eigerman not lying down dead friend
walkin around in my fucking cell dead
now what about that
he grips his briefcase tightly
boone sits in his cell head down expression masked eyes moving restlessly
ashberry is sitting half in shadow and half in light
his eyes carry the half buried mania that well see erupt later on
he puts his head against the wall and speaks softly to boone his tone intensifying as his feelings take stronger hold
ashberry can you hear me
theyll find a way to kill you you know that
cant fight the darkness
not when its inside you
are you listening
youre an abomination boone
you have to die
theres lots of ways
ive read about them
seen them when i sleep
he suddenly slams his bloody hand against the wall
ashberry have you got a god boone
any godll do
i had one but
he doesnt listen any more
i ask him to take the dreams away but they keep coming
blood and fire
like the end of the world
we move from ashberrys stricken face to the bloody mark his hand left in the wall
it vaguely resembles something we recognize baphomets head
lori emerges from a supermarket with food to eat
she walks into a small square finds a seat and sits down to eat
as she reaches into the bag babette v
she looks round
the voice sounded real
no sign of babette
close your eyes
lori frightened where are you

lori closes her eyes
lori and babettes p

their voices merge into one
lori babette v

rachel steps into view and looks directly down at the camera
rachel what is it child
loris eyes spring open
lori closes her eyes again and we click back into
lori and babettes p
we see babettes view of rachel
lori babette v

rachel whispers what are you talking about
grips babette what have you done
lori babette v
ive brought her to see

babette breaks away rachel tries to catch hold babette runs
camera veers around and down through the maze of midian
eyes closed on the bench lori gasps as the journey snatches her up
lori and babettes p
babette races over a rope bridge
we see it all through her eyes her hands coming occasionally into view
we head down a narrow tunnel and into a small chamber which is babettes hidehole
we scan the treasures she keeps there a doll made of grasses birds skulls pretty stones
we hear voices from above and we look up at a steel grille facing out on the surface
pushing closer to the grille we see
joyce pettine tommy and gibbs wandering through the necropolis armed to the hilt
only joyce carries no weapon
pettine christ you could hide a fuckin army in here
tommy what egg zactly are we lookin for sarge
tommy spits some tobacco juice on a tomb were here to kick some major league butt
joyce distrusts these throwbacks were here to scout not engage tommy well what if they engage us

lori babette gasps pettine hears the sound and walks over to the grille
tommy why dont we just shoot em in their graves
save us diggin new ones giggles fires at one of the tombs joyce angry hold your fire
pettine we want prisoners tommy
pettine goes down on his haunches beside the grille runs the muzzle of his gun along it
camera withdraws into the shadows
he shakes his head and
we cut out of the p
as pettine stands
pettine theres something down there all right
joyce if thats the case well call for back up
pettine spots a movement in the shadows of a half open mausoleum door
he catches gibbs eye nods in the direction of the door gibbs gets the idea and starts to back towards the tomb
pettine a performance i dont know
maybe were just spooked
hell whod live in a graveyard anyway
crossing towards gibbs what do you say lieutenant
maybe we oughta just pack it in
head for home
he and gibbs rush the door of the tomb theres a cry of surprise from inside
lori and babettes p
camera glides back up to the grille in time to see gibbs and pettine drag ohnaka out of darkness and into the sunlight where he lacks the strength to resist
tommy well lookee what we got here
tommy strikes ohnaka with a rifle butt knocking him to his knees
as the cops circle around ohnaka he moans puts his head down and covers his face with his hands
dont look so tough to me
pettine want we should interrogate it lieutenant
joyce amazed give it some room
in the sunlight ohnakas naked back begins to smoke and blister
gibbs what the hell for
joyce god damn it
theres something wrong with him
tommy disgusted shit
pettine what the fuck is this
gibbs unfazed steps up to ohnaka and kicks the creature over
gibbs we want answers asshole
joyce back off gibbs
gibbs ignores him trying to drag ohnakas hands away from his face
lori and babettes p
watching the knot of men around the defenceless ohnaka
lori babette v
gibbs rifle butts ohnakas hands then pulls them away from his face the features are horribly disfigured blood running from his eyes scorched by the sun
now even gibbs tries to back away but ohnaka grabs hold of his shirt
get it off me
tommy no way man
pettine fires his piece at ohnaka hitting him in the belly and arm but he still holds on throwing back his head and howling
smoke rises from his entire body dust pours from his veins
the howl becomes a high pitched whine and he explodes in a burst of dust and black blood
lori and babettes p
they see ohnaka die
lori opens her eyes which are running with tears
lori oh my god
oh my god
she stands up her hand to her mouth
lori and babettes p
babettes trembling hands hold onto the grille as she watches
lori dont leave please dont leave me
the cops stare in disbelief at ohnakas dusty remains
dyou see that fuckers face
joyce it was the sun
the sun did it
gibbs christ on a crutch
joyce man that tears it im calling the fuckin chief
gibbs raises a trembling match to his cigarette as tommy heads back to the cars
gibbs couldnt have been just
just the sun
joyce believe it shithead
pettine grinning so if all it takes is the sun we got the perfect weapon right over our heads
joyce until it goes down
pettines smile fades
then a cry of alarm from the distance
the men rush to the gate
the two police cars are on fire
the other cops reach them pettine reaches into the one less involved in flame and pulls out the radio microphone
joyce who did it did you see anyone
tommy shakes his head
they all look up hearing a distant car engine
wearing a hat and dark glasses laughing narcisse drives this old clunker like a maniac takes a large cigar out of his mouth
he strikes a match off a thumb hook and lights up
in the back protected from sunlight by shades on the windows is rachel
the door opens a panicked labowitz enters
labowitz chief come quick
eigerman from inside a stall this better be good
labowitz pettines on the radio theyre under attack
eigerman hot damn we got contact
he bursts out of the stall hitching his trousers
eigerman enters takes the two way receiver
behind him decker labowitz and kane enter the office
eigerman pettine whats your situation
pettine on the radio as the others try to keep back the flames
pettine into radio the place is crawling with em
they torched our cars
the transmission breaks up
eigerman turns to the others in the room
sound the call boys let the bells of freedom ring we got to mobilize
decker affectionately runs his hand over his briefcase
lori moves down the street blinking through tears
lori i have to go babette i have to get help
ill be back i promise

the connection fades
lori wipes the tears from her cheeks
the crowd and journalists still hanging around eigerman throws the door open
eigerman listen up
we got officers under attack i need volunteers for a posse
yall sign up with officer labowitz here
he moves back towards the office as labowitz clipboard in hand is besieged with offers
decker is sitting with his briefcase open on his lap gazing at the button head mask inside
he snaps the case shut as eigerman re enters followed by the silent kane
eigerman digs a key out of his desk
eigerman if youre gonna make an omelette you have to break eggs isnt that right professor
decker doesnt follow sorry
eigerman christmas comes early this year
eigerman leads decker kane and another cop down into the bowels of the station
he unlocks a door and switches on a light
warehoused inside is a virtual arsenal in a number of packing crates stencilled with a martial insignia and the name the crates are also stamped with their countries of origin
south africa and the soviet union
eigerman ounce a prevention is worth a pound a cure
save for a rainy day one day that day will come
dont matter if its commies homos freaks or japs we are ready

kane pulling off a shroud to unveil thats why we bought these cherry israeli army high octane linear field flame throwers
eigerman now i know what youre thinkin doc maybe theres some sorta spiritual angle to all this
well we got that covered too
a cell door swings open
decker and eigerman look in on the baptist preacher reverend ashberry
eigerman reverend ashberry your services are required
decker he looks like a drunk
eigerman he is lost his way poor bastard hauling ashberry to his feet you wouldnt wanna miss the day of judgment now would you
ashberry seems hes been waiting for this the apocalypse
eigerman theyre warming up for it over in midian
leading him out padre you get your pious butt over to church and load up on some holy water and crucifixes
were goin in there with god on our side
boone looks out the window of his cell as a large unruly posse musters outside in a variety of vehicles
a mix of survivalist fanatics in sons of the free labelled camouflage marlboro men with six shooters red neck bozos with their diesel dyke mamas and heavily made up bimbos
out for a good time
the atmosphere is one of near carnival
accoutred for combat kane and some other cops distribute the weapons
boone slumps away from the window his worst fears realized
reverend ashberry arrives lugging six full canteens and an arm load of crucifixes
he loads into the back of an enclosed high tech camper with eigerman and decker
eigerman blows an air horn claiming the crowds attention
eigerman you are all hereby deputized in the name of the law
now lets kick some ass
eigermans truck leads the caravan which drives off horns honking war whoops and liquor fuelled courage
as the dust clears now left more or less alone lori looks at the police station
a beat up car squeals to a halt in front of her and the front door opens
narcisse hey chickie want a ride
lori sees rachel and gets in the car
narcisse drives around the block smoking his cigar
narcisse we have to get boone out midian needs him
lori what could he do
rachel he went into baphomets chamber

so what youre saying is youre saying hes dead
narcisse hey some of my best friends are dead
im going out of my mind
narcisse to rachel see
i told you shed take it well
the posse heads down the road whoops and hollers emerging from the dust cloud it kicks up
eigerman cleans his silver plate magnum
decker sits beside him holding his briefcase across from ashberry whos frantically paging through an ancient bible
eigerman ever performed an exorcism father
eigerman ever seen one
eigerman well id start rehearsin if i was you
hands a gun towards decker why dont you hang on to that doc
decker a little prim oh no i wouldnt know how to use it
ashberry finds something in the book reads listen
so moses spoke to the people saying arm yourselves for war and let them go and take vengeance for the lord on midian
and so they burned with fire all the cities where they dwelt and killed the kings of midian both man and beast
eigerman with a wink hey how bout that doc
sounds like were on a crusade against the devil himself
ashberry not terribly convincing i dont believe in the devil
ashberry looks at decker no trace of irony in his expression
ashberry sorts through the canteens finds the one that doesnt have a white cross on it opens it and knocks back two fingers of bourbon
the sun sinking low in the sky
the shadows are long
the station is eerily quiet
labowitz and an irish cop connie cormack guard the cells
two other cops patrol the end of the corridor
all heavily armed
labowitz moves to the door of boones cell
the spy hole cover is open
boone looks up
labowitz from other side of door hey freak face we found your pals
theyre gonna fry just like you
give us a smile now
boone stares at the floor depressed defeated
labowitz chuckles and closes the spy hole
he walks back down to the coffee station near eigermans office where cormack is pouring two cups
he takes out a flask spikes his mug and offers some to labowitz
cormack little irish in your joe constable labowitz
labowitz a bad brogue dont mind if i do constable cormack
there is a knock on the station door
they look at each other
cormack picks up his gun and crosses to the door
cormack whos there
help me please
cormack whats wrong
we need help
cormack decides to unbolt the door
on the step stands rachel shrouded in black veils
only her eyes are visible
they fix cormack
cormack whats the problem lady
she drops the veil
the other half of her face has disappeared into smoke
what the blazes
her costume falls to the ground
her eyes dissolve
as smoke rachel blows into the station
cormack fires through the smoke yelling as he does so
labowitz running towards the cell hold em connie
the two other cops hear the shot and run towards the station
labowitz runs back in with them before they get there slams and bolts the door
labowitz to the other cops hold your ground
yells through the door cormack
you all right
cormack turns back towards the door sees narcisse screams and fires twice
narcisse flips one of the bullets out of his chest with a thumb nail then leaps onto cormack who manages to shoot himself in the foot
lori enters slams the door and locks it
narcisse squats over cormack holds his razor nails under his chin
narcisse where is he
cormack cell f f f five
through the door
narcisse grins at lori i love a coward
labowitz and the other cops confidently prepare for a siege
labowitz calling back to boone dont think youre getting sprung freak
no way they get through that door solid steel armour piercing shells wouldnt even make a dent
smoke seeps through the key hole and from beneath the connecting door
you hear me freak
no fuckin way
the smoke from the key hole begins to form into a face which floats on a cord of smoke flesh from the key hole
the smoke from beneath the door forms into breasts and rib cage in which a heart beats
labowitz turns and sees it
he empties his gun through the smoke the two cops on the other side of the smoke are hit and go down
an arm moves towards labowitz so does rachels face
her beauty mesmerizes him
her naked breasts which float beneath the head barely connected to it as yet enchant him even more
rachel come closer
i dont want to kill you
her hand presses labowitzs rifle aside
rachels lips touch him
he doesnt resist but once his mouth is sealed against hers he cant breathe
he tries to raise the rifle but she dashes it from his hand
then she snatches the keys from his belt and breaks the kiss
he falls to his knees gasping
her body completed and naked rachel unlocks the connecting door then starts looking for boone
behind her as labowitz reaches for his gun narcisses hand reaches in and grabs his throat
narcisse naughty naughty
labowitz looks up into narcisses scarred face and faints
lori steps past labowitz to the cell rachel directs her towards
rachel we dont have much time
lori i know
lori unlocks the door
lori nervous boone
boone wakes stay away from me

lori so fight

he kisses her
first tentatively then with great passion
narcisse knocks calls through the door
narcisse what the hell are you doing in there
fucking is the answer
they are wound around each other licking biting gasping
boone thrusts up into her
narcisse to himself jesus
bastard does better dead than i did alive
the connecting door flies open a rejuvenated boone and lori move into the office where narcisse and rachel are waiting
narcisse toys with the unconscious cormack
rachel are we going
narcisse about time
narcisse all right
boone its about time they saw the truth
gibbs joyce tommy and pettine wait outside the gates
joyce looks at his watch moves over to pettine and speaks quietly
joyce how long until dark
pettine two hours
two and a half
i told em to bring gasoline
well burn the bastards out
joyce has it occurred to you maybe weve got this all wrong
we could be destroying
i dont know a whole new species
pettine you saw that fucker below lieutenant same as me
that damn thing was just too weird to live
joyce maybe theyre just different
pettine isnt that enough reason
joyce stares at him
in background tommy starts to holler
what is it
tommy is pointing frantically at a dust cloud in the distance
a violent cut to the roar of engines as we track with the fast moving posse
eigerman stands up out of a skylight in the cab of his truck eggs on the other vehicles with a rebel war cry
eigerman yee hah
as the caravan appears
tommy and gibbs dance a jig together
gibbs its the fuckin cavalry
the posse speeds down towards the necropolis gates
narcisses beat up car speeds down the highway towards midian
boone how much further
narcisse a mile maybe two
we close in on rachel who stares ahead of her as if in a trance
rachel were too late
narcisse hang on
steering hard he veers the car off the road and into thick woods
branches thrash against the windshield
this is a shortcut
the posse is busily at work around the necropolis eigerman and kane supervising
some are laying trails of gasoline through the pathways
others are simply patrolling guns in hand
there is an air of nervous anticipation
ashberry comes round a tomb and we follow him down a walkway staring in awe at the mausoleums and statuary
looking at a particularly large tomb ashberrys eye is captivated by a large fantastically rendered marble winged angel
he approaches it reaches up to touch it
the angel a monster turns to look at him with sad impassive gravity
then we see its shadow on ashberrys face and hear the slow thick beating of its wings as it flies off
he fumbles the top of his bourbon canteen off takes a long drink then stops when he sees a load of dynamite taped to the side of the tomb
he follows the wire that leads off it to another dynamite pack on an adjacent tomb and then another
kane is escorting eigerman and pettine down a pathway pointing out the posses handiwork
packets of plastique at every intersection trip wires outside the biggest tombs we figure thosell be the major escape routes

eigerman kane pettine and the other cops begin to pull back
ashberry looks up as he hears grindings and growls in the earth
boone is lifting off the top of a nearby tomb
ashberry is about to shoot when narcisse grabs him around the throat puts a finger to his lips and signals him to be quiet
narcisse follows boone into the tomb
the tomb lid scrapes as its pushed back into place from beneath
ashberry starts to pray
boone and narcisse move through the panicking underground creatures fleeing in every direction
boone sees lylesburg trying to keep the panic down moves towards him
lylesburg stay down

from this high vantage point decker watches the preparations below through binoculars with the glee of a pyromaniac at a fire storm
the sun is setting
he stares up at it squinting into its brightness
the mask v
decker looks towards the patrol car parked nearby
the front door is open
on the passenger seat sits his briefcase
decker quickly crosses to the car

decker opens the briefcase
the mask and his knives are laid out inside

decker swings round slamming the case shut as joyce approaches

decker believe me lieutenant whoever or whatevers living down there deserves whats coming
joyce monsters you mean
decker unnatural misbegotten creatures
joyce i dont know
the only monsters ive ever seen had a human face
as joyce looks down at the necropolis decker sneaks an anxious side long glance at his briefcase
the final explosives layers exit their backs covered by flamethrower and machine gun carrying mob members
a distraught ashberry is the last out
midian is now completely deserted
dandelion seeds drift down the walkways caught in shafts of sunlight
eigerman pettine and kane looking at their watches
kane a pause then
t minus fifteen seconds
ten nine eight seven six five four three two one
kane depresses the detonator
there are two large explosions followed by several smaller ones
part of the necropolis wall is blasted out
several members of the posse retreat
eigerman pulls his pistol
you there stand your ground
fires a warning shot stand your ground damn you
the defectors stop
several more chain explosions in necropolis
narcisse is leading a group of child monsters as the explosions bring earth plunging down from the ceiling
we see several creatures howling in bestial terror
babette is separated from narcisses group by falling earth nearly trampled in the chaos
she is picked up by the dog faced man
babette i want my mother
man well find her
peloquin squats on the step overlooking the fire pit listening to the sound of invasion from above
there is a mixture of fear and rage on his face
in the darkness opposite kinski
kinski we began this
peloquin i just wanted meat
i didnt know he was going to cause this
kinski there were prophesies
the seventh saviour
peloquin i didnt believe the prophesies and i didnt obey the law
you want to see me bleed for it

he exits the chamber
smoke billows over the walls
eigerman moves closer to the gates listening to the wild cries from inside
he grabs ashberry by the collar
eigerman that sound like a heavenly choir to you padre
ashberry i have to see
ashberry shakes himself free and heads through the gates into the necropolis
eigerman turns to the others lights a cigar
eigerman were moving in
pettine locks and loads his machine gun yes sir
turns addresses the posse were movin in
car engines are revved headlights turned on piercing the smoke
ashberry wanders through the necropolis as the breed begin to emerge on every side
the air is full of sad melodious sounds like whale song
ghostly forms appear from the smoke and drift towards him
ashberry in awe dear lord
some of the creatures brush him as they drift by their strange beauty entrances him
ashberry dear lord
there are images here which have the flavour of christian iconography
mother and child
a man bleeding from his brow
a creature with a halo of smoke
he wanders on
decker watches impassively
joyce moves towards the gate
as he reaches it an extraordinary creature appears
joyce my god
it means no harm
joyce steps aside and the creature moves off into the night
we cut back to decker
the mask v
dont deny me philip
decker hears shouts to his flank steps back out of sight and sees lori and rachel emerge from a hiding place lori trying to restrain rachel from going in
lori rachel no
rachel breaks away and runs towards the necropolis
lori is alone
the mask v

shes the only one who knows about us
decker what about boone
the mask v

decker smiles all right

the briefcase is opened
the light of distant fires flicker on the mask
boone and narcisse lead the column of breed children and babies up from underground into the necropolis itself
boone hurry up
narcisse is this wise
coming above ground
boone if we stay below theyll slaughter us
narcisse this is their territory
the nights ours
now get the rest of the children up here im going to find a clear way through
he heads away leaving a frightened group of breed and children
peloquin appears overground scanning the destruction before racing off
eigerman addresses the assembled posse
eigerman theyre coming out and theyre armed so watch yourselves
its a fucking freak show in there
were not taking prisoners
its us or them
lets clean up
the engines rev and the posse charges the gates
the lead vehicle driven by a manic grinning kane rams the gates and crashes through
kane us or them
us or them
on the other side of the gates peloquin appears in kanes headlights
peloquin jumps up into the air as the car careers towards him
we see him somersault in the air
kane hears him land on the car roof
we see peloquin on the roof bend over the windshield
his face appears in front of a panicking kane the mouth suddenly opening grotesquely wide
kane slams the breaks on
peloquin is thrown off
kane eat dirt fucker
peloquin is thrown to the ground his face caught in the blaze of headlights as kanes vehicle revs and drives at him
kane ecstatic yeah
his momentum carries the car towards the crater blown in the ground
kanes pleasure turns to horror
kane oh shit
he turns to swerve but too late the car heads over the edge
wounded peloquin crawls off
dirt falls from the roof
the car slides into the earth
the guns stacked behind him fall forward
kane oh my jesus
kanes car drops through the roof of midian falling through the core breaking bridges as it falls
breed are thrown off walkways to their deaths
the car strikes the top of baphomets chamber and a plume of fire followed by several small explosions marks kanes death
the explosions rock the chamber
baphomet looks towards the roof with great sadness on his face
boone enters the initiation chamber
lylesburg is standing beside the bowl of baphomets blood which is bubbling furiously
boone what the hell are you doing down here
we need help
lylesburg this was intended
boone fuck that
were not going to lie down and die
lylesburg its baphomets will
hes going to destroy the naturals and us
everything in one last fire
boone how do you know
lylesburg look for yourself
he points to the bowl
boone its going to blow
boone hell destroy his own people
lylesburg better it ends quickly
we cant escape them
we remind them of the darkness in themselves
they hate that
boone so did i

we can make it out
but i need fighters
lylesburg were not warriors
boone what about the berserkers
lylesburg theyre uncontrollable
boone all the better

doubt and fear mingle in lylesburgs look but he finally nods his head
lylesburg ill release the berserkers
boone be quick
we havent got forever
the drummer is at the door
boone you come with me
the rest of you get out of here
he exits with the drummer
the posse enter in large numbers firing to left and right
we see breed shot down
boone races to the entrance to see eigermans posse moving towards the necropolis
one of the posse has a flame thrower
he burns up the foliage
from boones p
we view the enemy grinning sweating monsters
theres no way out in this direction
lori looks towards the conflagration
lori oh jesus boone
behind her we see a familiar masked figure approaching decker
she doesnt hear him over the shouts and screams
one of the posse fires a rocket into a giant breed who explodes
boone reacts with horror at the destruction
when he turns back he sees breed watching too defenceless
boone arm yourselves
youre not cattle for christs sake
they dont have any right to kill you
he races back the way he came and pulls coffins from the walls tearing their lids off with supernatural strength
he breaks the wood into clubs
the breed watch him
you need weapons or its over
one or two understand and do as hes doing
boone all of you
they do as he orders
boone stop them getting in
theyll kill the children
lori turns to see decker appearing from the darkness
he attacks her cutting her arm
she backs away before he can strike a second time retreating towards the gates
then she turns and walks through the reeds decker on her heels
the posse led by pettine invade the entrances to the necropolis engaging in hand to hand combat with the breed
boone races through the necropolis finding that other posse members are breaking in from other sides
boone theyre everywhere
the nightbreed children hear the sound of slaughter approaching
one of the breed with enormous dark eyes speaks
leopardo we cant stay here
narcisse he told us to
leopardo he cant help us
hes too late
we see the posse shooting breed as they move towards the children
several are entering doorways that lead underground
posse enter the core firing at anything that moves
lylesburg his leg broken is hobbling towards the berserkers chamber as the sound of gunfire gets nearer
narcisse still keeps an increasingly panicked group of breed and children from scattering
pettine and two bloodied grinning posse appear through the smoke
pettine look what we got here
a freak show nursery school
the group back away but two more posse members appear one with a flame thrower another with grenades
pettine say goodnight
boone from above goodnight
pettine looks up
framed against the stars boone
he drops on pettine breaking the mans neck
then he and narcisse lead the attack against the posse dispatching them all
narcisse what ways safe
boone the west wall
but be quick
im going after eigerman
leroy and lude hide around the corner of a mausoleum
two posse members are beating a breed up with their rifle butts
leroy heads out to help
lude whats the plan
leroy the usual
you take the big guy
he yells to the naturals hey
leroy raises his hands in surrender
leroy i wouldnt do that if i were you
st posse give me a good reason why not
leroy ill give you two
the snakes emerge from his body
st posse shit
he raises his gun but lude flips over his head landing behind him and in front of the nd posse member
ludes eyes blaze
lude pretty gun
the nd posse member looks down at his hands
the gun is covered in snakes
he drops the gun
when he looks up lude has gone
he turns again backing off towards a monument
lude is there a living devil hidden amongst the carved variety
he takes hold of the man turning him round and driving his horns into the mans neck
he staggers back blood pouring from the opened wounds
leroy meanwhile draws the st into an embrace
the snakes strike
poisoned the man dies
leroy look at this mess
lude just like the old days
kane leads two cops through the mayhem firing to right and left
he shoots a breed against one of the mausoleums
blood is spattered on his face
kane look at these bastards
he wipes the blood from his face
then he takes off his spectacles and wipes the blood off them
as he does so st cop yelps
st cop yow
st cop pulls a quill from the back of his neck
st cop where the fuck did that come from
kane puts his spectacles back on and sees shuna sassi in one of the mausoleums
she moves sexily in the shadows
kane grins and starts to approach
nd cop wait
kane its just a girl
st cop is still rubbing the back of his neck
he is looking sick now
st cop i dont
kane pushes the mausoleum grille open as the st cop kneels over face down
the nd cop kneels to help him
meanwhile kane has stepped into the mausoleum
shuna is in the corner her spines covered with the swaths of red cloth
kane its ok baby
he lowers his gun
outside the nd cop turns the st over
he is frothing at the mouth his face blotchy and sweating
nd cop oh shit
inside again shuna drops her cloth and leaps at kane
nd cop now approaches the mausoleum
nd cop kane
as he reaches the threshold kane staggers out his body and face pierced in dozens of places with shunas spines
he reaches for nd cop
nd cop keep away from me
in panic he fires at kane who falls to the ground
as the smoke clears a hand appears and strokes his cheek
he screams and falls to the ground at her feet his arm covered in spines
he twitches and dies
she drops her swath of red cloth over the faces of the three dead men
cut to eigermans leering grinning face as he fires at breed
ashberry emerges from the shadows and grabs him
please youve got to stop
takes out a pistol points it theres children down there youre killing children
eigerman go ahead faggot pauses contemptuously you havent got the balls to pull the trigger
eigerman snatches the gun away and pistol whips him to the ground
eigerman draws a bead on ashberrys forehead
lemme show you how its done
nearby joyce sees them draws his weapon ready to fire at eigerman when a shadow passes over him
he ducks his expression changing from horror to wonder
ashberry eyes closed hands clasped fervently father i am heartily sorry for having offended thee
eigerman sorry padre
prepares to shoot boone v
i hear you
eigerman turns looks and fires as boone leaps at him
he roars effortlessly picks eigerman up and body slams him against the wall of midian
to ashberry get up
ashberry dont kill me
boone run go on
we dont like priests here
ashberry pulls at his collar tears it off clings to boone
ashberry no no take me i have to see
boone gets a sense of his commitment
he heads off
and at a distance so does joyce
boone races through the walkways ashberry following
there is pitched hand to hand battle on every side
nightbreed are prevailing in some in others the mob repeats scenes from the history we witnessed earlier breed being beaten or burned to death impaled on stakes
boone assists some along the way pulling off their assailants
lori enters the necropolis running through the smoke
lylesburg has reached the door of the berserkers chamber
he puts the key in the lock
a shout stops him turning it
he looks towards a man with a laser sight rifle
the light from the rifle plays on lylesburgs robes
man watch the pretty light
it moves up towards lylesburgs face until its centred on his forehead
the man fires killing his victim
lylesburg falls hanging from the door by the key chain around his neck
his many eyes have opened
the man grins
then hears a noise behind him
he turns to see the ferreol vees creatures like manta rays that glide through the air appearing around the corner
they swoop towards him separating
the middle one opens its mouth as it strikes his face
he is eclipsed
when the vees pass on down the corridor the mans face is a bloody wreck
he falls to the floor just out of reach of the berserkers who roar their frustration
boone and ashberry are on one of the walkways which are swinging violently
boone hears the berserkers roar and heads towards the door that leads into their corridor leaving ashberry on the bridge tears pouring down his face
then he follows boone
as he reaches the ledge he looks back to see a fabulous beast the mezzick muul and its beautiful rider diadaria appear
he watches awestruck
lori races through the smoke and horror of the necropolis as decker follows
boone reaches the door
lylesburg is dead
boone pulls the key from off lylesburgs neck and pulls the corpse aside
then he turns the key in the lock
the door opens
a rush of filthy wind emerges from the chamber beyond
then the berserkers appear lethal brutes all teeth armour and muscle
one of them ghost takes hold of boone and theres a beat when it seems certain to dispatch him
then a burst of light from baphomets chamber spills over them and theres a roar from their unseen god
they let boone go and theyre away
boone looks towards the chamber then heads back towards the surface
tommy leads a line of five posse members who have cornered a number of wounded breed against one of the walls
one of the creatures attempts to scramble away
tommy guns him down
he turns to the other gunmen
tommy watch this
the two posse members prepare to kill the breed
the ground around them begins to shudder and a fist bursts out of the ground and grabs the leg of a posse member and drags him down
another fist then bursts out of the ground
then in silhouette the berserkers climb out of the earth beside the posse
two of the posse turn and fire at the berserkers who advance through the hail of the bullets and quickly dispatch the two gunmen
tommy has begun to fire at the feet of the cornered breed obliging them to dance
tommy laughs dance fuckers
the display gets appreciative hoots and laughter from the three surviving posse members who like tommy are as yet unaware that the berserkers are advancing on them
tommy continues to fire at the ground around the breed as one by one his three companions are dispatched by the berserkers
we close in on tommy whose face is suddenly spattered with blood
he stops firing
he looks round to find himself surrounded by berserkers
the shadows fall over him
their hands take hold of him
we see the shadow of what they do to him on the walls his body is torn apart
we cut to the berserkers
ghost has tommys gun with the hand still attached
he tosses it aside roaring like king kong
the wounded breed hurry away as the berserkers head off in search of new mischief
with the tide turning inside the necropolis a disorganized retreat is underway
eigerman is at the gate watching the remains of his army staggering away
joyce is watching the scene
eigerman stand your ground
stand your ground
theyve got to come this way
we can mow em down
he climbs up on a vehicle which is parked at the gates
in the driving seat is gibbs
beside him a woman her face smoke stained her expression near catatonic
gibbs switches the lights on to pierce the smoke
the illumination shows the berserkers appearing
they approach the vehicle
eigerman jumps from the vehicle as the retreating posse fire at the berserkers
its a useless response
bloodied but unbowed the berserkers run at the vehicles
the woman throws herself out but gibbs isnt quick enough
one of the berserkers pushes the vehicle up the wall of the necropolis and blatz a small vicious creature stamps on the roof
inside gibbs cowers as the roof is beaten in
he is crushed
joyce who has been watching this entire scene moves away from the gate towards the necropolis
the fires are dying down somewhat and an eerie half light bathes the scene he moves through
a few surviving posse hurry away firing at every movement in the shadows
back at the gate we see one of the escaping berserkers flip another car over while his brothers dispatch posse members
the survivors simply drop their weapons and flee
the dog faced man lies dead at the door and beside him babette her face subtly bestial
joyce hears babette weeping her cries hit him hard
he goes to her gathers her up gently in his arms
babette clings to him he sees her arms are partially transformed into claws but he keeps holding her
boone emerges from the depths into the wrecked mausoleum
he goes to them lori
babette points outside
lori runs decker follows his steps steady relentless and gaining
lori takes another stride and the ground gives way beneath her
she slides down into the earth
boone is tracking them joyce following carrying babette who has a vision
chaos and collapse
earth is falling all around
lori picks herself up and finds her way back up is blocked by debris
she has no choice but to cross the swaying walkways while the air thickens with dust and smoke
there are only one or two breed left alive down here desperately collecting their belongings
they exit the chamber leaving the smoking bowls
we track towards the bowls as the contents brighten and bubble
lori descends a flight of stairs to find peloquin badly wounded at the bottom
peloquin its all over
i didnt believe the prophesies and now its all over
lori what prophesies
peloquin takes her arm
peloquin you want to see
peloquin pushes lori ahead of him
we track towards the mural
lori can barely believe her eyes
here laid out on the walls is a whole history and featured amongst its more recent additions the face of boone
peloquin yes its him
boone squatting in front of his fire of love letters
boone dead in the reeds
peloquin all these years waiting for a saviour
but he hasnt saved us
hes destroyed us
i made him and hes destroyed us
lori made him
peloquin the bite was mine
the bite that mocks death
lori that doesnt make him yours
i belong here on this wall just as much as you do
why arent i here
peloquin youre still a natural
go back while youve still got a life
join your tribe
not any longer
peloquin then die with us
lori looks back at the images on the walls once more
then she exits
boone joyce and babette approach the hole where lori fell
babette let me down
i cant go any further
boone why not
babette looking down into the hole baphomet
boone to joyce take her
joyce nods and moves off with her into the smoke
as she disappears decker steps forward from the smoke
decker quite a dance huh
death everywhere and you and me in the middle
he throws the head of a breed at boone
decker even the dead can die
then decker strikes out at him slashing at boones face
boone falls backwards
at the last moment he catches hold of decker pulling him down into the hole and together they tumble into the earth
boone and decker land on one of the rope bridges
boone heads across it pursued by decker who slashes at his neck cutting him
boone falls back
decker closes on him the knives at his neck
the force of his stabs which miss boones neck break the boards of the bridge
boone braces his feet beneath decker and tosses him over
decker gets up and approaches him again slashing the ropes of the bridge with his blades as he comes
the fighters connect and struggle their violent motion carrying them over the edge of the bridge dropping them down another level
decker lands very heavily and lies still
boone gets up
his exit along the bridge in one direction is blocked
he has to step past decker who doesnt move
only when boone has stepped beyond him does decker get up pursuing boone across the bridge and flinging one of the knives at his victims back
the blade cuts straight through boone sticking out from his chest a good six inches
he turns his fury transforming him into a more extreme creature
decker comes at boone with a second blade slashing at boones neck
the battle carries them off the bridge onto the stairs
decker takes hold of boones hair preparing to deliver the coup de grace
boone reaches for a weapon finds a skull and smashes it into the mask
decker lets go
boone tumbles off the stairs falling face down on a card table
decker follows down the stairs
boone pulls the table off his chest leaving the ace of hearts on the blade in his chest
decker follows through driving boone back into one of the breeds rooms where the fight continues
decker takes a whip from the wall and uses it to disarm boone who has snatched up a bone to defend himself with
boone snatches up a second bone and retaliates delivering blow after blow against decker eventually knocking the knife from his hand and driving him out on to the ledge once
decker teeters on the edge now defenceless
boone want to dance
he snatches the mask off deckers face and draws him close impaling decker on his own blade
then boone pushes him off the blade and over the edge of the ledge
boone stands on the ledge and spits down at the corpse
as he does so he hears the same roar from baphomet that called the berserkers from harming him
out of it comes baphomets face
the chamber is empty of life
there are two or three corpses on the floor
we approach the central dais on which is perched the statue of baphomet surrounded by six white heads
momentarily lines of light break from the statues head and strike the white heads which in turn begin to glow
in the chambers weve seen before we see copies of the six statues in front of which are bowls of baphomets fluid
they begin to glow the brightness building
sparks rise from the fluid
lori sits exhausted in the corridor
she looks up to see boone with the knife still transfixing him
lori my god
boone deckers dead
take the knife out
lori pulls the knife from him and throws it down
lori dont go
i have to
lori and boone head down the corridor passing ashberry who is standing in the shadows
lori and boone head down the stairs towards the chamber
as boone descends into the chamber he sees eight nightbreed surviving members of a senior council rachel among them standing around baphomet
they are wrapping severed limbs of baphomet preparing to include him in the exodus
his head and shoulders remain suspended in the light
baphomets lips move making a terrible eloquent sound
rachel translates the deep voice we hear coming from her lips
rachel baphomet come closer
baphomets remaining arm reaches down and holds boone as baphomets face stares down at him
you have destroyed our refuge
boone i never meant
baphomet silences him
boone trembles but maintains eye contact
rachel baphomet this was foretold
no refuge is forever
but you are charged
you must rebuild what youve destroyed
rachel baphomet that you must find yourself
in the world above
boone i dont
i dont know how
rachel baphomet you shall not be alone
you will find me there and heal me
holds him close you are not boone
and now the words emerge from baphomet himself shaking the chamber
you are cabal
boone cabal is released
baphomet is consumed in light
the council move towards him to finish their task
boone cabal turns lori stands at the bottom of the slope offering a hand
he takes it they start up the slope
cowering in a niche inside the chamber out of sight watching in wonder is ashberry
transfixed by baphomet he crosses himself
boone cabal glances back
the council receive pieces of baphomet from the light wrapping his smoking fragments in shrouds
the light builds to its brightest level
pieces of ceiling begin to fall
the bowls start to explode with sparks of white light
boone cabal and lori race up towards the surface as midian continues to collapse around them
ashberry descends the stairs into the blaze of light
tears pour down his cheeks
he watches as the council prepare to take down baphomets head
near to him is one of the bowls of baphomets light
ashberry approaches it hungry for a taste of this glory
he reaches to touch the bowl
as he does so baphomets eyes fix on him
the bowl flips in the air
the fluid it holds rains down on ashberry like acid
he falls back his body smoking
boone cabal and lori reach the surface and race through the ruined necropolis flames all around them
and then behind them
the tentacles attached to baphomets head are detached
the blaze of light instantly begins to diminish
the lights start to go out in the core and earth begins to pour from the tunnels
we see it flood the various corridors with a shuddering roar
we glimpse baphomets head being covered by the council as the roars increase
boone cabal and lori find joyce holding babette protecting her near the gates
joyce steps back from the form of rachel who pulls her veils around her and holds out her arms
rachel give me my child
joyce looks at lori boone cabal at babette and rachel
he tenderly hands the child over
rachel holds babette and they both disappear into the darkness
joyce to boone cabal
i never understood
nobody ever told me
he steps away from them and the night engulfs him
the earth has almost obliterated the core entirely
the roar ceases
lori and boone stand in the reeds as the last bright bloom of the fires dies away on their faces
figures move away through the smoke creatures we recognize
the drummer beats out a tattoo as they depart
narcisse appears from the darkness
as he does so a final explosion roars up from the underground
in the smoke pillar above the site baphomets image momentarily appears before the wind disperses it
narcisse never piss off a god
lori looks up into the sky
of the sky with other breed spirits of smoke and light moving away into the night
lori where are they going
narcisse any hiding place they can find
itll be dawn soon
boone when i need you where will i find you
narcisse youll find me
and you will need me
he reaches to shake boones hand
narcisse never touched a legend before
he laughs his manic laugh
to lori good night pretty
he fades into the night the laughter going with him
in the distance the burning ruins of midian
the wind sighs in the moonlit reeds
cabal and lori reach the top of the hill turn and look down standing apart
cabal ill have to start tonight
lori ill go with you boone
cabal im not boone lori
do you understand
i belong to the breed now
lori then make me belong too they made you one of them you can do it to me
cabal i cant
lori i want to be with you
cabal ill come back for you when im finished
lori and whens that gonna be when im ninety and youre still the way you are
i went through hell to find you and you just just walk away from me
pause broken hearted well go on then just go
what more do you want
leave me some dignity for christs sake
she turns away trying not to show him her pain
cabal turns to go
lori turns back sees him going
she cant bear it looks around sees deckers briefcase lying beside the police car
runs to it finds a knife
she puts the blade to her belly and drives it in
cabal lori no
she cries out and sinks to the ground in terrible pain
he reaches her and holds her in his arms
lori i lied i lied youre all i want
cabal dont die god lori dont die
lori well why dont you do something about it god damn it
remember what you said
he raises her neck to his mouth
her eyes flicker closed
a fatal bloody kiss
he rises from her
her eyes are closed
oh god too late
her eyes open
lori you said youd never leave me
she grins presses up to kiss his bloodied mouth
camera moves up off them to find the moon and we we track through the ruins of the necropolis
the walls are blackened by fires that are almost extinguished corpses human and breed lie in barely distinguishable bundles from which partially cremated limbs jut
smoke hangs in the air
from the distance we see eigerman going amongst the corpses reclaiming guns bullets and grenades
as we get closer we realize that he is a broken man his face dirty his eyes lunatic
hes been crying the tracks marking the dirt
suddenly he hears a noise and stands up to see a large figure appearing from the smoke
he goes for his own gun levelling it at the figure as it approaches
eigerman keep your distance
the figure keeps coming emerging from the smoke
he has been transformed by the confrontation with baphomet
his hair has been almost burned away entirely and there is a subtle reconfiguration in the shape of his skull
his clothes are in tatters
there are hints that his once broken body poisoned by alcohol has taken on new strength
he looks as insane as eigerman but stronger in his lunacy
theres a dangerous fervour in his eyes
ashberry i saw their god
i saw him
eigerman what the hell are you talking about
ashberry i can still smell him
hes out there
ashberry walks past eigerman towards the exit from necropolis
eigerman you mean you can find them
ashberry oh yes
eigerman well go together then
you can lead me to the bastards
then ill wipe them all away
their god burned me
i want to burn him back
all of them
burn them all away
eigerman you cant you dont have the wits
ashberry turns on him his face wild
he takes hold of eigerman by the neck his fingers digging into the muscle
eigerman tries to raise the gun but ashberry takes hold of the mans hand and summarily snaps his wrist
the gun is dropped
ashberry starts to lift eigerman up off the ground
the policemans flailings stop suddenly
the head lolls
ashberry flings the body aside and starts out of the necropolis
as he approaches the exit he looks up
sunlight falls on his face
we move down to find a derelict barn standing alone in a vast field
we track through the darkness to find rachel babette kinski and a number of other refugees and children of midian staring out at the night
who will come for us
kinski his name is cabal
he unmade midian
babette how soon
rachel on the next wind
if not tonight then tomorrow
babette gazes out over the cornfields
babette on the next wind
cabal and lori standing on the hill against a background of stars
if not tonight
moving through the ruined chambers illuminated by dying flickers of flame we find and track along the end of the heroic mosaic mural
it tells in a rush of images the story of the ruin of midian
camera comes to a stop on the final image cabal and lori as we just saw them on a hill framed against the star filled heavens
the sound of the wind
fade to black
