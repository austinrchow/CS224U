written by andrew jones against black screen a title card appears the boundaries which divide life from death are at best shadowy and vague
who shall say where the one ends and where the other begins
edgar allan poe title card dissolves
we slowly pan through a suburban neighbourhood located on the south shore of long island
the still shroud of night blankets the village of amityville in the early morning hours
title card appears thursday november
title card dissolves
stray house pets are the only signs of life as families and neighbours slumber
we reach ocean avenue a large dutch colonial house
the home is a classic piece of americana two stories plus an attic several rooms and a boathouse on the amityville river
there are quarter round windows on the top floor that give the appearance of eyes staring back at us
a signpost in the front yard reads high hopes a testament to what the home symbolizes for the family that live there
we move slowly through the basement past various crushed beer cans and a table full of drug paraphernalia until we reach a bearded man in his early twenties
ronald defeo junior known to his family and friends as butch
he sits on a ragged sofa dozing off in front of a small television that displays white static
there is a digital clock on a small table by the side of the sofa
it reads am
we hold on the clock and the time changes to am
we can see defeos breath drift from his
lips as cold air sweeps through the room
his eyes snap open
a hooded figure face shrouded in darkness steps from the shadows
the figure carries a
caliber lever action marlin c rifle
hands clad in black leather gloves the mysterious person holds the rifle out in front of butch
a voice emerges from beneath the hood that is so deep as to be kill them
kill them all
butch stands and takes the rifle
the figure retreats back into the shadows
the house is silent
butch quietly stalks the hallways the rifle grasped tightly in his hands
butch quietly pushes the door aside and observes his parents as they sleep
ronald defeo senior age forty three is a heavy set italian american man and his wife louise defeo is a slender woman aged forty two with flowing blonde hair
both are lying flat on their stomachs
without hesitation butch raises the rifle to his shoulder and pulls the trigger
the blast is deafening
the first shot rips into his fathers back tearing through his kidney and exiting through his chest
butch fires another round again hitting his father in the back
this shot pierces the base of ronald seniors spine and lodges in his neck
louise defeos eyes open but she barely has a few seconds to react
butch aims the weapon at his mother as she lays prone on the bed and fires two shots in quick succession
the bullets shatter her rib cage and collapse her right lung
both bodies now lay silently in fresh pools of their own blood
butch in an almost trance like state walks down the hall and quietly nudges the door to another bedroom
butch enters the bedroom that his two brothers mark aged twelve and john aged nine share
he walks between their two beds as they lie on their stomachs sleeping soundly
standing directly above his two helpless brothers butch fires one shot into each of the boys as they lay sleeping
the bullets tear through their young bodies ravaging their internal organs laying waste to the lives that lay ahead of them
mark lays motionless while john whose spinal cord has been severed by his brothers heartless attack twitches spasmodically for a few moments after the shooting
stangely the loud shots have not roused the remaining members of the defeo family and butch skulks unchallenged to his final destination the bedroom shared by his sisters dawn eighteen
years old and allison aged thirteen
as butch enters the room allison stirs
she looks up just as butch lowers the rifle to her face and pulls the trigger
butch then aims his weapon at dawns head and squeezes the trigger again literally blowing the left side of her face off
both girls die instantly
the white sheets and walls are splattered with blood and brain matter
butch is unmoved and expressionless
he surveys the carnage for a moment then calmly walks out of the room
butch walks past a photograph hanging on the wall in a red frame
it shows all seven members of the defeo family in a group hugging each other with smiles on their faces
the sound of children singing the nursery rhyme ring around a rosie in a slow haunting manner echoes through the house
we push in on the photograph and a car drives through the village of amityville on a cold winters day
title card appears title card dissolves
a young girl in her mid twenties is driving the car
she is attractive yet she dresses very conservatively in a thick sweater and baggy combat trousers
this is lisa templeton
she consults a crumpled piece of paper
directions are scribbled on it
the car turns the corner and heads down a long driveway surrounded by trees
the car approaches a large imposing building which casts a dark shadow over the grounds
outside a sign reads high hopes hospital
lisa is sat on a bench in a long empty corridor
she has a file in her hand and taps her fingers on it nervously
a door opens and a middle aged man dressed in a crisp white shirt and tie steps out
he is well groomed and his eyes are warm and inviting
this is doctor elliot mixter
lisa stands abruptly dropping her file in the process
sorry lisa scrambles to pick up the file and papers fall out of it
oh god im sorry i didnt mean to say that
its quite alright
im doctor elliot mixter
come into my office
lisa manages to retrieve the file and papers from the floor and compose herself
mixter holds the door open and lisa enters the office
lisa stands in the office
mixter enters and shuts the door
please take a seat
lisa sinks into a chair next to a large oak desk
mixter walks to the opposite side and sits in a large leather chair facing her
brought my resume and some references
i know i already sent a copy with my application but just in case
mixter takes the file from her and opens it on his desk
he glances over it
i see youve had lots of experience cleaning private homes
yes i uh
ive done a lot of them
well an institution such as this one is a very different proposition
yes i know
youll see ive also worked cleaning a school so i am used to big areas
yes ive seen that
when i say this is a different proposition i mean in terms of the sensitivity required due to the nature of what we do here
oh yes yes of course
you would mainly be working night shifts at a time when patients are on lock down
but many of our patients here have psychological disturbances so there may be situations where you have to clean up things you may not be used to cleaning up
if you know what im saying
i know what you mean yes
would that bother you
it may be strange at first but i actually have some experience in that area
i would clean my mother when she lost control of her bodily functions during her illness
its something i got used to very quickly
it became routine
how is your mother now
she passed away
im sorry to hear that
its important to me that every employee here whether they are a psychiatrist an orderly or a cleaner needs to fully understand what our mission statement at this hospital is
high hopes was only built two years ago and as an institution we have only been running for just over a year now
so were still building our reputation
but i am very clear on what i want that reputation to be
i intend to make this institution one of the foremost centres for mental health treatment in the country
if you look into my history youll know that i have a stellar reputation in the field of psychiatry and i want to use that to help others
that is why i have put my own money into the creation of this institution
we are only just starting out but we have a long term ambition to be considered the best
so what i require is that every person who works at this institution in any capacity must be professional and sensitive to the needs of the patients
unlike other institutions the welfare and care of our patients comes first here
i really admire that and i promise i would not let you down if i was given this job
im sure you wouldnt
lisas face quickly contorts
mixter looks puzzled
suddenly lisa sneezes
it shoots out so rapidly she has no time to cover her mouth and nose
she sneezes all over mixter
lisa looks horrified
oh my god im so sorry
lisa rushes to mixters side and grabs a tissue from a kleenex box on his desk
she frantically wipes the saliva and snot from his face
its quite alright please sit down i can take care of it
lisa completely mortified sits back down
an unimpressed mixter wipes the spittle off his face with a tissue
when hes done he stares at lisa
well thanks for coming in
ill let you know
look im so sorry i really am
well be in touch
such is her embarrassment lisa cant get out of the office fast enough
lisa is lying on her bed watching tv flicking endlessly through the channels
the phone on the bedside table rings
lisa picks up the receiver
how did it go today
it was a total fucking disaster
oh im sure youre just being silly hun
whenever ive gone for an interview i always come out thinking its gone really badly
but i bet it went better than you think
i sneezed on the head of the institution
i sneezed on him
it was one of those sneezes that just sneaks up on you i didnt have time to cover my face
before you know it hes covered in my snot
oh god im sorry hun
long silence on the line
go on go ahead
you know you want to
laugh it up its gonna be your last chance because im not going for any more job interviews
im done im always so damn nervous and i just dont make a good first impression
you should take my advice and show a little cleavage at these interviews
trust me youd get the job then
thats just not me nance
i wouldnt know where to start with flirting or any of that
christ if i wore high heels to one of these interviews id probably trip over
im a clumsy dork
so what are you thinking of doing
thanks for not disputing that dork remark by the way
laughs sorry hun
i guess ill have to sign on welfare to make the rent
long term maybe i should go back to school
get better qualified for something
how come you dont do something with your writing
you could try and get something published
or write a book or something
i dunno i just
its like i just havent been able to bring myself to write since
its a cliche but time really is a healer
im sure the passion you had for it will come back
you wanna talk about it
i just think im gonna get myself a nice big tub of ice cream from the freezer and watch some tv
smiles i know but if theres ever a good time for ice cream its today
cant argue with that
give me a call tomorrow lets go for coffee soon yeah
lisa is rummaging in her freezer for some ice cream
she pulls out a tub and tosses it on the counter
she opens the cutlery drawer and grabs a spoon
the phone rings
lisa walks over to the phone and picks up the receiver
lisa this is doctor mixter at high hopes hospital
oh i uh
im just calling you to say it was great to meet you today and id like to offer you the job
lisa is stunned into silence
are you there
is this a joke or something
no joke id like to offer you the job
oh my god i
i cant believe it
im pleased to welcome you to high hopes hospital
if you can be here at am tomorrow for an induction please and well go from there
oh god thank you so much
i really appreciate this i wont let you down
i know you wont
well see you tomorrow
okay see you tomorrow
lisa puts the phone down with a smile
lisa enters the hospital
a man in his thirties dressed in a boiler suit is stood on a step ladder
he is attempting to change a light bulb in the hallway but seems to be making hard work of it
the bulb drops from his hand and smashes to the ground
lisa looks up at him
lisa averts her eyes but the man is now aware of her presence
he has a polish accent but his english is very articulate
can i help you
yeah im here for an induction into the cleaning job
you must be lisa
yes thats right
doctor mixter said you would be coming
im delaney well be working together
delaney climbs off the step ladder and shakes lisas hand
we work nights so today well just show you around okay
okay thank you
ill clean this up and well get to it
delaney opens the cupboard door and for a moment he and lisa are silhouetted in the doorway
delaney pulls a string hanging near the door and a light comes on
the cupboard is packed with various cleaning products
this is the storage cupboard
everything you will need for each
task is here each shelf is labelled
the most obvious task is hoovering
this is our hoover here its straight forward
youll be surprised that although its powerful its very quiet because we are working when everyones in bed so obviously we dont want to wake them up
it has a telescopic suction tube and six stage filter system
so a lot more powerful than you may be used to
the mop and bucket is here we usually use standard bleach to mix with the water so thats straight forward
but there is this specialist stain remover that you must use if there are any stains on the floor or carpet
it needs to be sprayed and left to set for twenty minutes before scrubbing or mopping
its a special formula for tea coffee water marks and other yellow and brown discolourations on the carpets or floors
its pretty strong so wash your hands after you use it
one of the worst parts of the job is we have to remove chewing gum from lots of surfaces
they dont just stick it underneath the tables it ends up everywhere
i think a lot of the time its the staff doing it not the patients
but we have this gumcart which is a bit complicated but its easier than just scraping the gum
the steam is super heated to one hundred eighty degrees and delivered at seven point zero bar pressure
it can produce a hundred and fifteen litres of superheated steam per minute
is it okay if i watch you use it a few times first so i know exactly what im doing
i dont want to end up burning myself or any furniture
now here we come to the most dangerous chemical we have
this is a concrete cleaner very toxic stuff so you have to wear the face mask and gloves we have here okay
this is for cleaning and descaling brick stone and concrete and for metal de rusting
for concrete you must mix it one part to four parts water
brush or spray it on with the equipment here then leave it five to ten minutes to set then rinse it off
but for those stubborn son of a bitch marks use it neat
dont worry if anything seems complicated youll get used to it
but youll mostly be mopping and hoovering in your first few weeks
yeah thats fine
lisa follows delaney into the communal area of ward b
the walls are white and clinical
various patients are scattered across the room each with a look of resignation in their eyes
many stare blankly out of the window
this is ward b one of two wards youll be responsible for cleaning each evening
essentially the main duties will be emptying the bins hoovering the carpeted areas and mopping the hallways
the patients in here are category b
theyre mainly people who have had nervous breakdowns and those who are catatonic
like missus hardesty here
delaney and lisa walk over to an old woman who is sat still in the chair
her eyes are open yet she appears lifeless
hello missus hardesty
no response or acknowledgement of other peoples presence
she hasnt spoken a word in all her time here
the orderlies just lift her from the bedroom to the day room and back again every day
why did you just talk to her
weve still got to treat them like human beings
otherwise they just become like furniture and we all lose our humanity
i like to think she can hear me even if she wont talk to me
see you later missus hardesty
missus hardesty continues to stare into nothingness
delaney and lisa exit
delaney and lisa stroll down the long corridors
the patients are locked in their rooms on our night shift but now and again they might have an accident we gotta clean up
in the day time there are nurses who often clean up but in the night we may be called to provide fresh linen or mop up
not the most pleasant of jobs but it happens from time to time
yeah i understand
delaney and lisa arrive at a doorway
now here we come to the most difficult part of the job
cleaning crap up isnt the most difficult part
oh no thats very easy compared to whats behind this door
whats behind it
this leads down to ward x
you could say that
its where category a patients are held
the criminally insane
doctor mixter didnt mention that
yes well these patients are beyond help so theyve become athe hospitals secret
many of them were transferred from prisons and other institutions
doctor mixter probably thought he could help them
the staff call this place blood row
delaney opens the door
lisa follows delaney down a winding staircase
as they descend down the steps the light fades
delaney and lisa enter a long dark corridor with a row of thick metal doors either side
two light bulbs hang from the ceiling at each end of the corridor providing only minimal illumination
lisas nose twitches
whats that smell
it always hangs in the air
no matter how much we bleach the floor there is always that smell of death
lisa looks concerned
these patients are dangerous
but dont worry we never have to interact directly or anything like that
you will just be mopping the corridor and dusting
delaney walks over to the first door on the right
there is a hatch on the door
delaney slowly slides it open and beckons lisa over
she peers inside
the cell is very basic white walls with the only furniture being an uncomfortable looking bed and a toilet without a seat
there are thick iron bars on one small window
a skinny man in his thirties sits on a basic bed in a white vest rocking back and forth
he has wild hair and a scraggly beard
thats jerry kimble
he was convicted of stabbing a young mother forty nine times in front of her two year old son then killing and sexually assaulting a woman before smothering her four
year old daughter
they call him the green chain rapist
he was in sing sing but was certified insane and his lawyer got him transferred here
he doesnt make any noise or fuss but he is a dangerous man
especially towards women
this next inmate is even worse
delaney slides the hatch shut and walks over to the next door
he slowly slides open the hatch and lisa peers inside
another basic white cell with only a bed and toilet
a man stands in the centre of the room with his hands behind his back
his hair is slicked back as jet black as the eyes that stare at lisa
delaney slides the hatch shut
thats dennis palmer
also known as the long island cannibal
he was abused as a child so his targets were always paedophiles and rapists
hed track them down and torture them
he would eat parts of their body while they were still alive
the most horrible thing is that a lot of the public thought he was a hero
delaney walks over to a door on the opposite side of the hallway
he slides open the hatch
lisa looks inside
inside the basic cell a woman sits cross legged on her bed
she has long flowing black hair intense eyes and a pentagram carved into her forehead
she looks up and smiles at lisa
delaney slides the hatch shut
whats her deal
she was a member of a witchcraft cult
they kidnapped six people for a demonic ritual
five were killed but one got away and led police to the cult
she turned her trial into a circus talking about lots of crazy stuff
the media enjoyed it but she got certified insane by the court
shes been around a few institutions since
now shes here
some strange stories here
well those arent the strangest
this last patient is the strangest case
delaney walks over to the last door on the left
he slides open the hatch
a singular shaft of light coming from a tiny barred window barely penetrates the darkness of the cell
lisa peers inside to see a man sat in the shadows
this is our resident john doe
sometimes we have people with amnesia
often we find out who they are
not so with this man
why is he down here
they first brought him in about six months ago
no one knows where he came from he literally just turned up late one night
an orderly found him wandering the grounds
first of all he was like missus hardesty upstairs catatonic
then a few weeks later he started to respond to doctor mixter and the nurses through facial expressions and gestures
but soon he got violent
hed have bursts of rage and beat other patients
one day he appeared to have a seizure and collapsed
a young doctor tried to take his vital signs
patient x here throttled him so hard he crushed his larynx
it took six orderlies to restrain him
now they wont even let him out for the obligatory hour a day exercise
we still dont know who he is
delaney stares at lisa
god has nothing to do with this man
delaney slams the hatch shut
lisa looks disturbed
i havent put you off have i
i guess not
its just a lot to take in
ive obviously never been around stuff like this before
this is the reality of this place
we dont deal with these people directly but we may have to clean up their mess
if you cant handle
that then i understand
you know that its not too late to back out
lisa considers for a moment
im not a quitter
the hospital is bathed in moonlight
lisa hoovers the carpet in the empty communal room
she then empties the bins
a clock on the wall ticks towards am
lisa is mopping
as she reaches the end of the hallway a young girl walks around the corner carrying a teddy bear
lisa is startled
ooh you made me jump
should you be out of bed this late
i dont know
the girl has flowing blonde hair and an angelic face yet there is a haunting sadness in her eyes
i dont think you should be
do you want to play with me
id love to sweetheart but its very late now
i think you better go back to bed
the girl walks away
lisa is returning the mop and bucket to the storage cupboard
she knocks a bottle off the shelf and leans over to pick it up
pov shot someone is approaching lisa edging closer and closer
a hand stretches out and touches her shoulder
lisa jumps and smacks her head on the underside of the bottom shelf
lisa turns around to see delaney standing there
sorry i didnt mean to startle you
lisa rubs her head
are you okay
yeah just hurt thats all
do you want to grab a coffee
delaney and lisa are sat on a bench in the hallway sipping coffee from plastic cups
did you change the bins in the day room
ive got a light bulb to change in room twelve upstairs soon
were making good time
its funny i never thought id get this job
the interview didnt go well
doctor mixter told me you were the only person he interviewed for the job
im sure he felt you were right for the job and didnt need to interview anyone else
lisa looks down at a distinctive tattoo on delaneys wrist
delaney pulls his sleeve down to cover it up
i forget i have it sometimes
what does it mean
it represents a lot of wrong turns in my younger years
delaney doesnt answer and takes a long sip of coffee
sorry i didnt mean to pry
lets just say the past is better left there
so how is the first night going for you
i ran into a young girl in the hallway earlier
sweet little girl she was only about twelve or thirteen
i told her to go back to bed
i guess they dont lock the kids in at night huh
delaney appears confused
you sure it was a young girl of that age
she was carrying a teddy bear
she was about thirteen at the most
there are no children of that age here
now its lisa who is confused
in fact there are no children of any age in this place
i think our youngest patient is about twenty
youre kidding right
no im serious
then who was that girl in the hallway
delaney contemplates for a moment
you sure you saw a girl that young
i better tell the orderlies
this is no place for a little girl to be
lisa is polishing a table
delaney walks in with hardcastle a well built man with a skinhead and visible tattoos on his arms
did you find her
so youre the one who saw the little girl huh
you sure you saw a little girl
well ive had to pull staff off other wards to search this goddamn place top to bottom
we found nothing
a big fucking inconvenience is what it is
do me a favour the next time you think you see something be absolutely sure before you go running to jumpsuit here
i aint got time to be running around this place looking for shit that isnt there
lisa looks embarrassed
dont worry about it
better safe than sorry
lisa walks tentatively down the staircase carrying a mop and bucket
a clock on the wall reads am
lisa walks into ward x
she looks down the dimly lit hallway and pauses for a moment
overcoming her nerves she places the bucket on the floor and starts mopping
as she edges through the hallway lisa notices a light flickering from underneath one of the cell doors
she walks over and slowly reaches for the hatch
sliding it open lisa peers inside
in the centre of the floor she sees a needle a piece of paper and a piece of red wool surrounded by six lit candles
she looks around and nobody seems to be in the cell
suddenly sadie jumps up right in front of the hatch
lisa falls backwards letting out an involuntary scream
she stumbles to her feet as sadie laughs
lisa slams the hatch shut and rushes towards the exit
delaney is sifting through a tool box
lisa stands in the doorway
hey can you do me a favour
can you empty the rubbish in doctor mixters office
ive got to check the boiler theres been complaints about the heating not working
lisa grabs a roll of bin bags from the shelf
lisa knocks on the door
she knocks again
lisa tentatively turns the handle
the door slowly creaks open
the office is empty
lisa walks in
she looks around for the bin finally locating it by the side of the desk
lisa pulls the full bag out and ties it up before replacing it with a new bag
with her task complete lisas curiosity gets the better of her
she looks around the office
there is a shelf full of psychology books and a filing cabinet
lisa touches the top drawer of the filing cabinet and it opens
lisa looks at all of the names on the files and finds one marked patient x
she reaches for it and suddenly a hand grabs her shoulder
a startled lisa turns around
an orderly in his thirties is stood in front of her
he is thin but muscular with slicked back hair
this is pemberton
what the hell are you doing in here
i was just emptying the garbage
funny i dont remember doctor mixter keeping the garbage in the filing cabinet
it was just open and i
well yknow im gonna have to report this
oh please dont i didnt see anything i just opened it
well new girl its hospital policy to report this kind of thing
but ive only just got this job and i really need it
pemberton looks her up and down
perhaps we can come to some arrangement
what do you mean
well id be doing you a big favour if i kept this to myself
so perhaps you can do me a favour
what kind of favour
a blow job
lisas face contorts with disgust
lisa tries to leave the room but pemberton stands in her way
oh come on i bet youd love it
look you better get out of my way or im going to report you for sexual harassment
youve been working here for five minutes
you really think doctor mixter is gonna believe a fucking cleaner over a medical professional
pemberton spins around
delaney is stood in the door way
leave her alone
she aint no prisoner here
i was just talking whats the problem
lisa come with me weve got a job up on ward b
a grateful lisa brushes past pemberton and exits the room
delaney glares at pemberton for a moment before leaving the room
delaney catches up with lisa who is a little emotional
it was just a little bit intimidating yknow
pemberton can be like that
he works nights with that other son of a bitch hardcastle
they like to throw their weight around
youll get used to it
people like that shouldnt be in charge of patients
lets get a coffee
you sure love your break times
i like to pace myself
time lapse passage from night to day and back again
lisa is stood on a step ladder dusting in the hallway
she steps down and walks past a clock on the wall
the time hits am
lisa walks into the day room and is startled to see mrs hardesty sat in a chair
missus hardesty you scared me
what are you doing up at this time
no response from the catatonic pensioner
sorry i forgot you dont talk
ill just go and get an orderly
lisa heads for the exit
missus hardestys head turns to look at her and her mouth opens
an unnaturally deep voice youre going to die in here
lisa stops in her tracks
she slowly turns to face mrs hardesty who stares blankly into space
what did you say
lisa stares at her but there is no response
ill go get an orderly
lisa walks down the hallway
at the other end of the corridor hardcastle and pemberton are leaning against the wall having a conversation
lisa approaches them
well look who it is miss sexual harassment
what are you laughing at
this ones got a big mouth
first ordering a search of the hospital for a little girl now shes busting your balls
look i dont want any trouble
i just came to tell you theres a patient whose out of their room in ward b
you wont get no trouble from me im a professional
unlike this useless bag of bones
hardcastle walks down the hallways with lisa
he looks back at pemberton with a shit eating grin
catch you later sweetie
pemberton raises his middle finger
lisa and hardcastle walk into the day room
the room is empty
where is this patient huh
she was right there in that chair
she even spoke to me
hardcastle bursts out laughing
missus hardesty was here and she spoke to you
just a second
hardcastle steps out into the hallway
a few moments later hardcastle re enters the day room with pemberton
the new girl here says that missus hardesty was just sat in that chair
says she even spoke to her
look i know shes supposed to be catatonic but i swear she said something to me
thats not the strange thing sweetheart
what do you mean
missus hardesty died this morning
the blood drains from lisas face
but i could have sworn
listen newbie how about you just get on with the cleaning and stay off the crack pipe
okay honey bunny
pemberton and hardcastle both laugh and leave the room
lisa is sweeping in the hallway
she looks up and just catches a glimpse of someone turn the corner up ahead
lisa looks around
the hallway is empty
she walks forward and turns the corner just in time to see the young girl carrying a teddy bear push open the door
she enters the staircase that leads down to ward x
little girl wait
lisa drops her brush and rushes forward
she throws open the door
lisa looks down and sees the young girl at the bottom of the staircase heading for the entrance to ward x
dont go in there
lisa rushes down the stairs after her
lisa pushes open the door to ward x
she peers down the dark hallway
the girl is nowhere to be seen
lisa slowly walks down the hallway passing the cell doors
she can hear whispering
lisa is drawn to the last door on the left
she approaches with caution
stood in front of the door she slowly slides the hatch open and peers inside
john doe sits in the corner cloaked in shadow
lisa peers down and in the centre of the floor illuminated by a single shaft of light from the small window is a teddy bear
lisa slides the hatch shut and walks backwards
she is seriously unnerved
as she steps back from the door she hears a whispering from kimbles cell
she edges closer to his cell door and listens
palmer can be heard from the next cell
his voice is calm in stark comparison to kimbles which sounds extremely agitated
my cock is so hard palmer
its so hard that i cant contain it any more
im going to break through this wall and do bad things to you
very very bad
i must advise you mister kimble threats will not be well received
im touching myself palmer
you wanna watch
you fucking faggot
stay out of my psyche mister kimble and ill stay out of yours
kimble starts to chuckle
then he stops suddenly
lisa leans closer to the cell door and she hears kimble sniffing
lisa jumps back as kimble kicks the cell door
i know youre out there girlie
i can smell your pussy
how about you join me in here
kimble bangs the door continuously
the racket echoes through the corridor
sadie soon joins in her and kimble laugh maniacally as they thump on the doors
a horrified lisa rushes towards the exit
an exhausted lisa changes out of her work clothes and into a large t shirt
the morning sun bursts through the window filling the room with an orange hue
lisa shuts the curtains and slides under the duvet cover into the welcome sanctuary of her bed
lisa drifts to sleep
lisa is sleeping fast as night falls outside
all we can hear is the rhythm of her breathing and the gentle ticking of the clock by her bedside table
suddenly her eyes snap open
we pull back and see that lisa is now stood in front of large wooden doors
the doors open and she steps inside
lisa enters a church full of powerful religious imagery
on the right side of the entrance she notices a font
a drop of blood pierces the blessed water
as lisa walks down the aisle we realise that everything has slowed to a crawl and she is moving in slow motion
white feathers cover the aisle bouncing around her bare feet
an open bible rests on the lectern the pages fluttering as if there is a strong breeze blowing them
lisa looks up at a crucifix on the
wall the contorted face of a crucified jesus christ stares at her
blood seeps from the crown of thorns and runs down christs face
as lisa gets closer to the altar she sees a female figure sat in the front pew
lisa ebbs closer
the figure turns
its lisas mother
dont you grieve for me
of course i do
suddenly tears of blood run down lisas cheeks
lisas mother reaches out a hand
lisa stretches her arm out to grab her mothers hand
everything is in slow motion it seems to take lisa forever to reach her mothers hand
suddenly a black gloved hand grabs her outstretched arm
she turns to see a hooded figure face shrouded in darkness standing next to her
a deep voice echoes around the church kill them
kill them all
lisas eyes open and she sits bolt upright
she is pale and soaked with sweat
it takes her a few moments to compose herself and realise that it was just a nightmare
the rain lashes down outside the institution
lisa is walking with delaney
okay next thing is mopping the floor in ward x
could you do that
i just need a break
does ward x frighten you
thats normal it frightens me sometimes
but ive got to go up to a patients room in ward a
apparently theyve had a little accident
surely you wouldnt prefer to clean that up
i know ward x is a scary place
but youll get used to it
i can hear them talking
its kinda unnerving
i know i hear that too when im down there
but trust me once you get used to it things will get easier
the door creaks open
lisa looks nervous
she walks in with her mop and bucket and heads to the end of the corridor
she begins mopping the floor
as she mops past sadies cell she hears a knock on the inside of the cell door
i can hear you out there
lisa is creeped out but she makes an effort to ignore it
she continues to mop the floor and starts moving past sadies cell
ive been talking to your mother lisa
lisa stops dead in her tracks
she looks back at the cell door
shes here with me lisa
shes told me all about you
lisa walks over to the cell door
i know youre out there lisa
talk to me
what do you expect me to say
perhaps you can tell me all about the summer trips to key west with your mother
those were your favourite memories of your mother werent they
or perhaps youd prefer to tell me about when you sat at your mothers bed side for six months watching on helplessly as the cancer ravaged her body and sucked
the life out of her
lisa is horrified
she is shaking
how do you know all this
because your mother is speaking to me from the flames of hell
you sick fuck
tears stream down lisas face
she has a message for you lisa
want to hear it
lisa wipes away the tears and tries to compose herself
want the message
what is it
there is a pause for a moment before an unnaturally deep inhuman voice emerges from sadies throat on the other side of the cell door a distraught lisa rushes towards
lisa rushes into the bathroom
a wave of emotion rises to the surface and she sobs into her hands
after a few moments the tears subside and she takes a deep inhalation of breath desperately trying to compose herself
lisa walks over to one of the sinks
she looks at her tear stained face in the mirror above it
lisa turns the tap on and water rushes out
she leans down and splashes the water on her face
lisa looks up and is startled to see her face reflected in the mirror as an old hag
lisa clutches her decrepit face in horror
she closes her eyes and opens them again
her reflection has returned to normal
lisa hears sadies maniacal chuckle echo around the bathroom
she rushes out
a visibly upset lisa rushes down the hallway towards delaney
whats wrong lisa
im not going down to ward x again im really sorry i just cant handle it down there
okay just calm down okay
tell me what happened
they say things to me through the doors
i know theyve done it to me too
but that woman sadie she says things she couldnt possibly know about me
lisa checks herself
i sound crazy dont i
this place just gets under your skin sometimes
im starting to wonder if im losing my mind
well its not healthy to think too much about what those crazy son of a bitches say
believe me you dont want them inside your head
its hard to keep them out sometimes
listen take a break from ward x for a while
ill go down there for the next week or so
im really sorry about this i didnt think it would effect me so much
dont worry it gets to everyone at first
but the last thing i want is for you to dread coming to work
delaney puts his hand on lisas shoulder in a comforting manner
i really appreciate that
time lapse passage from night to day and back again
continual thumping on one of the cell doors echoes around ward x
pemberton enters and walks over to palmer cell
he slides open the hatch
whats with all the fucking racket palmer
sorry to bother you mister pemberton
but i wondered if it would be possible to get some medical attention
palmer holds up his arm and its been slashed open
blood pours from the wound
now how the hell did that happen
palmer holds up a makeshift knife
i believe it was this rather crude weapon that did the damage
jesus christ palmer
now put the weapon on the floor and back away
palmer obliges with a smile on his face
pemberton unhooks a truncheon from his waist belt
put your hands on your fucking head and face the wall
palmer willingly follows the instructions
pemberton takes a set of keys from his belt and unlocks the cell
im coming in dipshit one fucking move from you and ill cave your fucking skull in
as you wish mister pemberton
pemberton walks in with the truncheon raised above his head
dont you fucking move
a nervous pemberton fumbles at his belt trying to unhook a pair of handcuffs
palmer slowly starts to back into him
i said dont fucking move
palmer moves faster
pemberton swings for him but palmer ducks it and spins around pushing pemberton into the wall knocking him to the floor
palmer aims a swift and savage stamp at pembertons head
his skull crushes against the cold hard floor
blood spatters all over the white cell
im terribly sorry about this
palmer reaches down takes pembertons keys and exits the cell
palmer stands at the entrance to kimbles cell
he selects the key marked with the corresponding cell number
palmer puts it into the keyhole and opens the door
good evening mister kimble hardcastle strolls down the hallway
hardcastle looks down to the base of the staircase
pemberton whats taking you so long man
hardcastle rushes down the steps
he sees the door of palmer cell open and slams a large red button on the wall next to the entrance
hardcastle takes out his truncheon and cautiously approaches palmer cell
looking inside he sees pemberton crumpled on the floor in a pool of his own blood
a scream emerges from the next cell
hardcastle rushes over to kimbles cell door
five orderlies rush onto the ward
we got a major code six over here
the orderlies rush to hardcastles side truncheons at the ready
hardcastle puts a key in the lock and prepares to open kimbles cell
hardcastle turns the key and kicks open the door
they are met by the sight of kimbles corpse positioned upright on the toilet
there is a hole in his head with part of his brain seeping out
palmer stands next to him with blood on his lips and a plastic spoon in his hand
he smiles blood covering his teeth
good evening gentleman
i believe we will be one short at roll call tomorrow morning
hardcastle and the orderlies charge palmer
he doesnt resist as they viscously tackle him to the ground
lisa is walking down the hallway
she hears a scream emerge from one of the rooms
she puts her ear to the door and hears the scream again
lisa kneels down and peers through the keyhole
in a clinical white room palmer is strapped down on a table
his face is severely cut and bruised but he is conscious
four orderlies hold his arms and legs while a fifth smears conductor on palmer temples
do we need to put the bit in his mouth
were not giving him the methohexital either
the orderly places electrodes either side of palmer head
he then turns the dial on the ect device up to full power
palmer screams as he violently convulses salivating heavily from his mouth
suddenly the saliva turns to blood as he bites his own tongue off
lisa is horrified as she watches the orderlies laugh as palmer experiences a severe seizure
pov shot someone is approaching lisa as she crouches in front of the door
a hand reaches out and grabs her by the hair yanking her to her feet
she turns to see hardcastle standing in front of her
he invades her personal space in an intimidating manner
what the fuck are you doing
i just heard something so i
i was just curious
what are you seeing in there
oh nothing i didnt see anything
you make sure it stays that way
that guy is a fucking menace and he deserves everything he gets
so you dont talk to mixter or anyone else about anything youve seen in there
i wont say anything
now dont you got some cleaning to do somewhere
lisa walks down the hallway
hardcastles eyes burn into the back of her head
lisa rushes towards the entrance
shes running late
lisa rushes inside nearly knocking someones coffee out of their hand in the process
she looks across the busy coffee shop and theres an attractive young blonde girl waving at her
lisa rushes to the table
im so sorry im running late nanc
dont worry about it have a seat
a latte yeah
good ive ordered it
theyll bring it over soon
lisa looks pale
black bags under her eyes
god hun you look like shit
sorry i didnt mean to be blunt but you do
the night shifts getting to ya
the whole jobs getting to me
my body clocks all out of whack but its not just that
theres something seriously wrong with that place
what do you mean
a waitress brings over the latte and places it in front of lisa
lisa proceeds to put four sugars in her coffee
wow you like a little coffee with your sugar
i figure itll wake me up a little
so whats wrong with the place
a lot of things
the way they run things for starters the orderlies are complete bastards
they usually are in those places
some of the patients are extremely violent
you havent been hurt by anyone have you
no nothing like that
some of the things they say though
its pretty frightening
the weirdest thing is
oh i dunno maybe its just me
i wonder if im seeing things
what do you mean
i think the place might be haunted
either that or im losing my mind
well i wouldnt be surprised if it was haunted
what do you mean
i told my father about your new job
well yknow they only built that asylum a couple of years ago
he says it was built on the site of one twelve ocean avenue
you never heard of it
it was a famous house
or should i say infamous
some guy shot his whole family there back in the seventies
parents brothers sisters
wiped out his entire family with a shotgun
then the next owners of the house only lasted there about a month
they said they were driven from the house by evil spirits
the house became known around the world
thats why the recent owners sold the land they had enough of all the media interest and constant tourists
have you seriously never heard of the amityville horror house
i vaguely remember hearing some stuff a while ago but i never really took it in
i honestly didnt realise that the hospital was on the same land
yup right on the spot where the house was demolished
you really think the place is haunted
either that or im going crazy
well youre not crazy hun
perhaps the stories about hauntings at the house were true
maybe the house is gone but the spirits stuck around
you believe in ghosts
i dunno never seen one
but i like to think im open minded
plus youre the most intelligent girl i know
if you say youve seen something i believe you
so what are you gonna do
are you gonna quit
part of me says i should
theres a lot about the place that frightens me
but i dunno
i think ive seen too much to be able to just walk away and forget the place
if i was you id just walk away
who wants to work at a place that frightens them
well i need the money for starters
but now it feels like i need to find out more
maybe you are crazy after all
lisa is sitting on her bed studying a laptop
on screen she ronald joseph butch defeo jr
is an american mass murderer
he was tried and convicted for the killings of his father mother two brothers and two sisters
we slowly push in on lisas eyes and then
ronald defeo senior is in the garden of his home chopping firewood with a large axe
title card appears november
title card dissolves
ronald butch defeo junior approaches him
you come to help
im going out
boy you better not be turning up for work tomorrow like a goddamn zombie again

i know what youre really doing with that money
you dont know shit
boy you better shut that mouth of yours
ronald senior stands there axe in hand eye balling his son
this aint over
butch storms back towards the house
ronald senior brings the axe forcefully down on a piece of wood splitting it cleanly in half
there is a knock on the door
a pale looking man in his twenties opens the door to reveal butch standing in the door way holding a brown paper bag
butch i told you man you cant get no shit on lay away any more
your credits all used up
butch pulls a wad of money out of the paper bag
you accept cash
come on in
butch uses a lighter to boil a spoon full of heroin
on his right arm is a belt
he then loads the heroin into a syringe
butch tightens the belt and taps his arm
he sinks the needle into a prominent vein and plunges the heroin into his blood stream
his eyes sink and he lies back onto the crusty carpet of the apartment staring up at the ceiling
from a birds eye view we slowly move down towards butch
suddenly a chorus of voices chatter around his ears
its kill or be killed
why havent you killed that pig
they are plotting against you
we have decided that you must take action
kill them all
butch puts his jacket on and prepares to open the front door
suddenly a large hand grabs the back of his jacket
butch swipes the hand away and spins around to see his father red with rage
nineteen thousand dollars boy
you stole that fuckin money from the auto dealership
what the fuck you talking about
i was robbed
didnt brigante tell you huh
some fuckers car jacked me pop
i told the police about it
you expect me to believe that boy

ronald senior grabs butch by the scruff of the neck and slams him against the door
louise defeo rushes in
what the hells going on
our sons a fuckin junkie thief thats whats going on
he robbed the fucking dealership
dont listen to him ma i aint done nothing
ronald senior and butch fall to the floor and start grappling
stop it now
louise attempts to pull ronald senior off butch
her nails dig into her husbands neck and draw blood
an enraged ronald senior grabs his wifes arms as she starts to slap him
butch scrambles to his feet and rushes down the hallway
ronald senior remonstrates with louise who is still trying to slap him
why do you always have to get involved huh
youve always been too soft on that boy
dont you touch him
he needs some fuckin discipline
stay away from him
suddenly ronald senior feels cold metal pressed against the back of his head
louise screams and steps back
ronald senior freezes
ronald senior slowly turns to see butch his eyes bloodshot and his face emotionless aiming a marlin rifle at his head
ive had enough of you fat man
ronald seniors trembles with fear as he stares into his sons cold eyes
butch places his finger on the trigger
butch pulls the trigger
the gun jams
ronald senior breathes a sigh of relief
butch lowers the gun and storms off towards the basement
louise embraces ronald senior who appears to be in shock
butch is quietly stalking the landing
he can hear whispers from his parents bedroom and cranes his neck to listen
i want him out of this house tomorrow
i guess youre right
hes twenty three now he just doesnt belong here any more
his age aint the problem louise those goddamn drugs hes taking are
im not having that going on under my roof
well talk to him tomorrow
the time has come
and its long over due
ronald stands upright
behind him is a figure in a black robe
kill them before they kill you
gun shots ring out
lisa scans down the web page and looks at photos of butch defeo and his family
suddenly she reaches a picture of year old allison and her blood runs cold
she recognises allison as the little girl she encountered in the hospital hallway
lisa and delaney are sat on a bench in the hallway drinking coffee
do you know the history of this place
theres not much history
weve only been open a couple of years
no i mean the history of the land
what was on the land before the hospital
i know a bit about that
one twelve ocean avenue
the amityville haunted house
well i dont know that it was haunted
lots of people think thats lies
i know about the kid that killed his family
i didnt know about it until a friend told me
its a famous case
how come you never mentioned it
you seem spooked already
i didnt want to make it worse
yknow why im spooked
because of the patients on ward x
its not just that delaney
i think this place is haunted
in fact im sure of it
youve seen something
remember i said i saw a little girl roaming the hallways here
i know who she is
shes one of the defeo children who were killed
you ever seen her
to be honest i dont believe in all that ghost stuff
well i wasnt a huge believer but i know what ive seen
i believe that youve seen something
some people are more open to that kind of thing yknow
im closed off to that extra terrestrial stuff
extra terrestrial is aliens
whatever its called i dont know
so what do you believe in
do you believe in god
serious questions tonight
im just curious
why do you ask
its something ive been thinking about
how can evil exist in a
world that many people believe was created by a loving god
i dont believe that god is a bearded man who lives in the sky
or that the devil is a red demon with horns
i believe god and satan are within all of us
god is our human side
satan is our animal side
whether we become good or evil depends which side of us we feed
its a frightening thing to believe that if god exists he is not powerful enough to stop evil
free will in the hands of a person who feeds the evil inside them
thats what frightens me
lisa ponders for a moment
doctor mixter must have known what stood on this land before the hospital
of course he did
he bought the land and organised the demolition of the house himself
why would he build on this land knowing the history of the place
hes not superstitious
hes a doctor they dont usually believe in those things
amityville is full of local legends going back even before the defeos
theres stories about the native americans being slaughtered on this land many years ago
some people even believed the indian chief possessed that kid who killed his family
i dont think thats true
if ive learnt anything from the patients on ward x its that some people have a mind that works in a different way to other people
those people who do bad things have fed the evil within them more than the good
its not possession its sickness
sickness of the soul
i dont know what to think
just dont let your imagination run away with you lisa
youre a person who feeds that good within you
dont let this place feed the evil
lisa enters the library
she approaches a stuffy looking middle aged woman with glasses perched on the end of her nose
hi sorry to bother you but my names lisa templeton
i rang yesterday to set up a meeting with gloria branco
yes thats me
thank you for agreeing to meet with me
no problem nice to meet you
ive set up a table in the back
got a few books that may help you with your inquiries
thank you thats great
lisa follows gloria to the back of the library
lisa and gloria are sat at a table in a secluded corner of the library
various books are spread out on the table
so you wanted to know about the history of amityville dating back to the native americans
yes thats right
im writing a college paper and i had heard some rumours in the neighbourhood about native americans being killed on the land down on oceans avenue
glorias demeanour instantly turns from jovial to serious
well that area has quite a dark history
you mean the defeo murders at one twelve
terrible business that
those young children
breaks my heart to think about such a tragedy
yeah its awful
you know most of the town was very upset when they decided to build that mental institution on the land
that used to be a nice suburban neighbourhood now theres this big eye sore there
we had a thousand names on a petition
but i guess that doctor who runs the place has enough money to pay off the people in high places
so what about the native americans
is that story about them being killed on that land true
theres something on that here
gloria flips through one of the books
ah yes here it is
reading in the th century there existed a group of native americans in amityville known as the satchem tribe led by satchem takapausha the chief
the tribe had fled salem in massachusetts to escape persecution by the christians who were persecuting members of the tribe because of their witchcraft practices
these practices included a ritualistic human sacrifice of six people the significance of six being related to the biblical number of man and creation in order to induce the spirit
of their god the dark master who they believed manifested his powers through his devoted followers giving them immortality
the hundred strong tribe settled in amityville but were later chased off the land by local christians
satchem accused the christians of not properly compensating his tribe for the land
a war started and the christians hired a hunter called john underhill from salem
at the site where one twelve oceans avenue was later built in amityville underhill killed all of the tribe
the indians were buried in a mass grave on the site
before he died satchem vowed revenge
according to local legend chief satchem is believed to have subsequently haunted the land
various parapsychologists and mediums have
claimed that satchems vengeful spirit influenced the defeo murders at one twelve oceans avenue and the haunting of the subsequent owners
although such assertions are widely disputed
so the legend has basis in historical fact
lisa is sat with delaney both nursing a cup of coffee
you told me the other night that you think evil is within us all
but do you think that people can be influenced by an evil that comes from outside of themselves
are you still thinking about this
i guess i am yeah
i worry that youre thinking too much
this place is getting to you
theres something going on in this place
and i dont just mean the patients on ward x
have you not noticed that
ive noticed some things
why havent you said anything
or done anything
delaney contemplates for a moment
its like the honey bee
what do you mean
the honey bee is fine when its just flying from flower to flower
then they think that a person is a threat and they sting them
they might leave a sting but the person will recover
the bee dies
so i ask myself
is it worth it
delaney returns his attention to the cup of coffee in his hands as lisa disappears into her own thoughts
lisa is sat in an armchair with a laptop resting on her thighs
on screen she is reading a wikipedia entry the satchem tribe was a tribe of native american origin that existed in the th century
they fled massachusetts and settled in amityville where they were ultimately murdered over a land dispute
the tribe was renowned for practices in line with witchcraft and worshipped a god called the dark master
in it emerged that a modern cult incarnation of the tribe existed
they have adopted the traditional beliefs of the satchem tribe but the modern followers are not required to be of native american origin
lisa scrolls down to the references section
she clicks on a link
a blog appears on screen entitled the dark master an ancient vision for a modern world
she reads the latest blog our time is at hand
on november th souls will be sacrificed so that the dark masters devoted followers may be blessed with immortality
as non believers perish on doomsday the masters loyal subjects shall live on and be bestowed with great power and responsibility for the direction of the new world
lisa opens up the calendar on her computer
november th is the day after tomorrow
lisa refers back to the blog and notices the author of the last blog post sistersadie
lisas mind is racing
lisa types sadie krenwinkel into a search engine
the first result is a wikipedia entry
lisa clicks on it
she reads sadie krenwinkel is a convicted murderer and former member of the satchem cult a modern incarnation of a native american tribe who practiced witchcraft in the th century
in krenwinkel led ten members of the cult to dennison drive where they subsequently tortured and murdered five individuals
one potential victim managed to escape and lead police to krenwinkel
at her trial in krenwinkel outlined the beliefs of the satchem cult claiming the human sacrifice of six individuals would have given them immortality
as a result her lawyer submitted a plea of insanity and krenwinkel was subsequently sentenced to indefinite incarceration in a mental institution
lisa reads further down the page and notices that the name of the doctor who testified to her insanity at her trial lisa rushes towards the hospital
lisa enters ward x
she walks down the hallway and bangs on sadies cell door
i know what youre doing
ive seen that blog
how are you getting access to the internet
lisa slides open the hatch and looks inside
the cell is covered in lit candles with sadie sat cross legged in the centre of the room
are you allowed to have all this stuff in your cell huh
the dark master is near
its too late to stop it now
tonight will behold a great becoming
whats going to happen
youre planning on a human sacrifice arent you
all good things to those who wait
sadie stares directly at lisa with intense eyes
an unnaturally deep voice escapes her lips our time is at hand
lisa slides the hatch shut
she walks over to the last door on the left
lisa slides the hatch open and peers in
the resident john doe sits in the shadows
suddenly he sits forward and a bright shaft of daylight illuminates his face
lisa is shocked to see a face she recognises from the internet article staring at her
the face of ronald butch defeo juniour
lisa slams the hatch shut and backs down the hallway her mind racing as fast as her pulse rate
lisa knocks on the door to doctors mixters office
lisa pops her head inside
oh lisa hello
what brings you here
i just wondered if i could speak to you for a moment sir
its very important
of course come in
lisa enters and sits down opposite mixter who is sat behind his desk filling out a form
what can i do for you lisa
what im going to tell you will sound really strange but i need to tell you
okay go ahead
do you know the history of the land the hospital is built on
what are you referring to exactly
well first of all
the defeo murders and the infamous house that people said was haunted
i am aware of the defeo murders yes
well i think its common perception now that a lot of that was exaggerated by the media
are you aware of the history of the land dating back to the eighteenth century
no i cant say that i am
there were a group of native americans in amityville known as the satchem tribe
they were massacred by christians after a dispute over the land
im sure theres a point to all this
sadie krenwinkel down on ward x
she shares the beliefs of the satchem tribe
i have reason to believe that somehow she has access to the internet and witchcraft paraphernalia and shes planning on a human sacrifice tonight to try and raise the god
she believes in the dark master and become immortal
have you been reading up on sadie
its rather outlandish stuff isnt it
but i can assure you she has no access to the internet or anything else
go on the internet and check out the blog
she signs herself sister sadie
well that could be anyone called sadie couldnt it
go down and search her cell
i dont believe that will be necessary
the patients on ward x spend twenty three hours a day in the cell
they get an hour of exercise in a small yard guarded by six of our staff
theres no way
that any of those patients have access to the internet or any paraphernalia
then someone is helping her get access to this stuff
someone who works here
please doctor mixter
just check out her cell and speak to her
if im wrong about this and its all just her delusions then fine
ill accept that
but i had to tell you
you testified at her trial didnt you
yes i did
what are you implying
i just meant you know how dangerous she is
yes i understand how dangerous she is and i appreciate you coming to express your concerns
one thing you need to bear in mind lisa is that there are some very sick patients at this institution
we do our best to help those who can be helped but unfortunately the patients on ward x are beyond help
their personality disorders are too advanced their delusions are too grandiose
i worry that perhaps you have been rather taken in by one of those delusions
i know that it might sound like that
but can you check her cell and speak to her
look at the blog on the internet see if you can connect the ip number of the writer with a computer here at the hospital
that does take time and resources i dont necessarily have
but as youve come to me with a concern of patient infraction and potential threat of violence i am duty bound to investigate
in fact ill order a cell search immediately
stay here for a moment ill be right back
lisa leans forward and a file on the desk catches her eye
she stands up and reaches over for it
her name is on it
lisa opens it up
inside is a form committing her to the hospital as a patient
lisa looks down and the reason stated is paranoid delusion
the date on the form is november th
lisa slams the file shut and the office door opens
she turns to see mixter stood there with hardcastle and another orderly
what the hell are you doing
this is for your own good lisa
you need treatment
the orderlies approach her
lisa lashes out but the two men overpower her grabbing her arms and then tripping her
she hits the floor with a thud
mixter produces a syringe from behind his back
this is for your own good lisa
mixter plunges the needle into her neck
pov shot lisa looks up at mixter and the orderlies and we fade to black
lisa awakens sat in the corner of a cold white cell
she tries to get up before realising shes strapped into a straight jacket
the hatch opens and mixter peers in
the hatch then closes and the door opens
let me out of here you sick fuck
now lisa lets talk calmly or you will be sedated again
mixter walks over and sits on the edge of the bed
why are you doing this
youre having paranoid delusions
im also aware that youve been having disturbing visions
im not having delusions i know what ive seen
well you think you know
the human brain is a powerful thing and im sure you do believe what youve seen
but its all in your mind lisa its not reality
youre a very sick girl and you need treatment
you do this to all your staff huh
the minute we speak out we get fucking committed
you were never staff here lisa
youre a patient here
youve always been a patient here
lisa appears confused
youre lying to me i know who i am
i know who i am
im afraid not my dear
youve always been with us here
initially as an out patient but now the delusions have progressed i feel its time for you to become a full time resident
lisa becomes upset
tears stream down her face
look i understand its a lot to process now
ill leave you to think about it and then well begin counselling sessions tomorrow
listen how about i take this straight jacket off so youre more comfortable
first you must take this
it will help you sleep
mixter hands lisa a red pill and a bottle of water
she takes the pill and pops it in her mouth before taking a gulp of water
i know its a lot to take in but together well get through this
now im going to take your restraint off
remember though if youre violent then i promise you it will go straight back on
mixter unties the straight jacket at the back and lifts it off
im going to leave you get some rest now
tomorrow we start the healing process
the echo of the steel door closing reverberates around the tiny cell
we hear mixters footsteps as he walks down the hallway
lisas upset demeanour disappears immediately
she spits the red pill into the palm of her hand
a storm is brewing in the dark sky above high hopes hospital
sadie is sat cross legged in the centre of her cell surrounded by candles
adoni helumnay peenay adoni helumnay peenay the gods do command thee from thy majesty oh mapulamun
mixter is in his office putting on a large hooded black robe
adoni helumnay peenay come forward blessed one know your calling come forward oh blessed one
mixter opens the cupboard and takes out a
caliber lever action marlin c rifle
the clock on the wall reads am
patient x is asleep in the corner
accept our humble gratitude for your offering in death you give life may you find wings to the kingdom
the dark master keeper of the gate master of all fate hear us
the lock of the door turns
patient xs eyes snap open
the door opens
mixter is stood in the doorway dressed in a hooded black robe
he holds the marlin rifle in his hands
he approaches patient x and holds out the rifle and a box of shells
patient x takes them
mixter walks out
mixter walks down the hallway and reaches for a series of buttons on the wall
he punches in a combination of numbers and all of the doors unlock
patient x is stood in the doorway of his cell rifle at his side
sadie rushes out of her cell and sees him
a broad smile spreads on her face
she turns to mixter
we did it elliot we did it
our time is at hand
immortality is ours
patient x raises the rifle and squeezes the trigger
the blast rips through the back of sadies head blowing half of her face away
she is killed instantly and her lifeless corpse drops to the floor
mixter smiles and leaves the ward
lisa has her ear pressed to the door
she can hear gun shots and screaming
she starts to panic and rushes over to the small window
she slams her hand into the window but the glass doesnt break
the lock on the door snaps
lisa slides down the wall terrified
the door opens and delaney walks in
lisa breathes a huge sigh of relief and rushes over throwing her arms around him
we need to get out of here
one of the patients is running around with a shot gun down on ward x
patient x kicks open the door to palmer cell
the lobotomised palmer is lying face down on his bed
patient x aims the gun and a shot tears through palmer back
hardcastle and another orderly rush onto the ward
patient x takes aim and shoots hardcastle in the chest killing him instantly
the other orderly turns to run and is shot in the leg
delaney and lisa run through the ward
they turn a corner and are suddenly confronted by a large group of patients in white gowns
delaney and lisa run back the other way and turn the corner
two orderlies brandishing truncheons are approaching
please help us
the patients are loose
well take care of them
the orderlies turn the corner and see the large group
the orderlies look at each other fear in their eyes
they turn to run but the patients overpower them in a flash grabbing and scratching deep wounds tearing into their skin
delaney and lisa look on as the helpless orderlies scream
shouldnt we help them
we need to save ourselves
let them reap what theyve sewn
delaney grabs lisa and they run down the hallway as the patients beat the orderlies with their own truncheons
lisa and delaney rush down the hallway
they turn a corner and are stopped in their tracks by the ghost of allison defeo stood in the centre of the hallway clutching a teddy bear
she has a huge bullet hole in the centre of her forehead blood dripping down her face
why dont you want to play with me
a door at the other end of the hallway is kicked open
patient x bursts through and aims the rifle
lisa and delaney rush back down the hallway
a bullet hits the wall just as they turn into an open doorway
lisa and delaney are running through the hallway
they burst through a door
lisa and delaney find themselves in the shower room
mould covers the walls and all of the showers are on gushing dirty water
they spot another door on the other side of the
shower room but blocking their path to it is a thin middle aged man in a white vest and white shorts facing the wall
he is whispering to himself
lisa and delaney stop
hey mister you need to get the hell out of here theres a patient going crazy with a gun
the man turns around
his face is weathered and his eyes are wild and bloodshot
my skins on too tight
my skin is on too tight
delaney grabs lisa and they start ebbing past the man towards the door
the man is getting increasingly more agitated scratching at his face
my skins on too tight
the man reaches into the pocket of his shorts and produces a scalpel
my skin is on too tight
the man stabs his cheek with the scalpel
the man drags the scalpel around his face in one continuous motion blood seeping from the circular gash
as lisa and delaney watch on in horror the man rips the skin off his face exposing muscles and veins
his white vest and shorts are now saturated with blood
the man sighs with relief
thats much better
a horrified lisa and delaney rush towards the door and burst through it
delaney and lisa sprint down the hallway as gunshots ring out in the distance
delaney and lisa rush towards the main doors
delaney fumbles for a set of keys
come on hurry please
delaney finds the right key
he checks the lock and realises that a key has been snapped off in it
a fucking keys been snapped in the lock
delaney rushes to the reception desk and grabs a chair
he rushes over to a window next to the door and raises the chair
a bullet tears through his back and exits through his chest with an explosion of blood
delaney drops to his knees and lisa rushes to his side
patient x loads fresh cartridges in the rifle
delaney is dead
lisa runs down the hallway
patient x takes aim
just as lisa bursts through a door a bullet blasts apart one side of the frame
lisa runs through ward b
lisas pov patient x bursts through the door and pursues her
lisa keeps running as patient x aims the gun
lisa looks back just as he fires and the bullet narrowly misses her the force sending her crashing into a stack of chairs
her leg catches on the chairs and she falls to the ground
lisa crawls towards a door
hauling herself up she manages to turn the handle and the door swings open
lisas pov patient x stands just yards away attempting to get a steady clean shot at lisa
he squeezes off the trigger just as she falls through the door the shot blowing the door apart
lisa limps down the hallway
she tries the handles of a door but its locked
she tries another also locked
lisa finally finds a door that is open and she rushes through
lisa enters a small staff room
she slams the door behind her
she clicks the lock
lisa steps back from the door
she jumps as patient x pounds on the door from the other side
lisa looks around for a weapon
she limps toward the cutlery drawer below a sink
she rustles inside and finds a large butcher knife
suddenly the door explodes a large hole blown through the middle of it by the gun shot
patient x reaches through groping for the lock
lisa reaches a large window in the room
she tries to lift the window
after an unsuccessful attempt at opening it she realises the window is nailed down
patient x reaches for the lock
lisa dashes to the storage cupboard and ducks inside
lisa pulls the door shut and falls to the floor of the dark interior
lisa faces the door bracing herself with the knife held upwards
everything is quiet
suddenly the door shakes as patient x thumps on it
the door cracks as patient x smashes against it
lisa crouches down with the knife at the ready
the gun blows a hole right through the door
patient x leans through the hole peering down at lisa crouched on the floor
he aims the gun through the hole and prepares to fire
lisa brandishes the knife and thrusts it forward with all her might
the blade rips through patient xs right eye
he screams and drops the gun in the cupboard before stumbling backwards into the staff room
patient x clasps his hands to his eye which is now gushing with blood
lisa grabs the gun and stands up
patient x looks at her with his remaining eye
lisa aims the rifle through the hole in the door
lights out you son of a bitch
the shot gun blasts a hole through patient xs chest blood splatters over lisa
suddenly a white light fills the room and allison defeo materialises
she is dressed in a clean white dress her angelic complexion bears no wounds
allison takes the hand of patient xs corpse
the white light swarms over patient xs body and he rises to his feet
his head is now intact and he is dressed in a white robe
he looks at allison and they share a peaceful smile
allison walks with patient x through a doorway filled with a blinding white light
they disappear and the light slowly dissipates
lisa covered in blood walks through the hallway with the rifle by her side
she reaches the door to doctor mixters office and kicks it open
mixter is sat behind his desk now dressed in his usual shirt and tie
lisa aims the gun at mixter whose hands are beneath the table
get your fucking hands up you sick fuck
insert shot mixter presses a red button beneath the desk
mixter raises his hands
i see weve dispensed with the usual pleasantries
come in lisa
lisa enters kicking the door shut behind her
mixter is very calm
lisa is trembling the rifle visibly shaking in her hands as she aims it at mixters head
you gonna tell me its all in my head now huh

well maybe it is maybe it isnt
how would you know

its all shit
the plan for the becoming is almost complete
just one more sacrifice thats all we need tonight
how about if i blow your fucking head off then huh
suddenly sirens can be heard outside
the screeching of car wheels
lisa still holding the gun at mixter shuffles over to the window and peers through the blinds
the car park is full of police cars
a dozen armed police officers rush towards the building
lisa looks back to see mixter chuckling
what the fuck are you laughing at
its all falling into place
the cops coming here
im gonna tell them everything about you and your little sick plan
theyre gonna lock you up and throw away the key
if you say so
outside they hear the police rushing down the hallway
tell me something lisa would it help your grief over your mother if you knew she was a slut
what did you say
thats why shes burning in hell
lisa her teeth clenched moves forward and places the business end of the rifle against mixters temple
you shut the fuck about my mother you dont know anything
i know that sometimes you wonder why you dont cry enough for her
i know you feel guilty for not doing more for her when she was alive
you feel guilty for moving on with
your life and forgetting about her
i have not forgotten about her
face it lisa you never cared for her
you never cared for anyone but yourself
shes looking up from the bowels of hell now knowing that you never loved her
tears stream down lisas face
she was a whore
lisa hits mixter over the head with the butt of the rifle
he falls to the ground and looks up at a crazed lisa
your mothers in hell and you dont care
lisa aims the rifle at mixters face
suddenly the police burst in
lisa spins around the rifle still in her hands
police open fire
her body is riddled with bullets and she falls to the floor in a blood soaked heap
title card against black screen appears title card dissolves
a glamorous woman addresses the camera
and were back with our next guest
a year ago he was a survivor of the high hopes hospital mass murder when cleaner lisa templeton ran amok with a rifle claiming six victims and injuring many others
doctor elliot mixter has written a new book entitled shattered hopes which provides an account of that fateful night as well as some background into the mind of the murderer
doctor mixter good morning
mixter is sat opposite in a very expensive suit
morning katherine how are you
im good thank you
so doctor can you tell us a little more about the book
well it features a blow by blow account of the evening
it was obviously a very harrowing experience and for me it was rather therapeutic to deal with my feelings about what happened in writing
how has it affected the hospital doctor
obviously we were all left very numb by events for a long time and i know a lot of people in the town felt we should close the institution
but that never occurred to me
i feel that people should be brought closer by tragedy and the staff and i have definitely become closer both as colleagues and friends since the incident
that bond makes for a better
institution in my opinion so we will continue to go from strength to strength
you mentioned there that some people wanted the place to close
i know many were also resistant to the opening of the institution in the first place given that it was built on the site of the infamous house where ronald
defeo murdered his family in the seventies
i know a lot of people associated with that case were accused of exploiting it for their own ends
youve also faced some criticism for that particularly as we heard last week that you have sold the movie rights to this book
how do you respond to that criticism
well i know that some people accuse me of hurting the memory of the victims but i feel im helping the memories of those involved live on
granted some victims were criminally insane but other victims were loyal staff who had families and im determined that they not be forgotten
each staff member gets their own chapter in the book so that the readers can get a full picture of what wonderful people they were
i always say that all forms of media whether it be books newspapers tv or movies are a preservation of life
our physical bodies may die but our images live on when we are famous
our work and our passion is preserved therefore its as if our souls are preserved
through all of these forms of media we are in effect immortal
mixter looks straight into the camera and smiles
the sound of children singing the nursery rhyme ring around a rosie in a slow haunting manner echoes around our ears
