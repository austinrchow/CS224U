written by alexandre aja gregory levasseur based on the original film by wes craven open on a geiger counter scanning over a rocky terrain
a sand storm blows over the landscape
we are lost somewhere in the middle of the new mexico desert
according to the instrument the area contains high levels of radiation
three men wearing full anti radiation suits have left their jeep behind to collect samples of contaminated rocks
not at all worried or bothered by the dust storm or high winds they walk towards the hills
the man holding the counter stops in his tracks loudly through the following his colleague no
its something else
its like the radioactivity is moving around us
the numbers on the dial continue to fluctuate
where is this intensity coming from
he turns around seeing nothing but sand and rock through his mask
suddenly for no apparent reason the geiger counter gets in confusion he taps on the instrument attempting to stabilize it but the radioactivity continues to climb
he looks up to the horizon obscured by the sand storm still nothing in sight
his colleague is probably right the geiger counter simply needs an adjustment
he turns it off when a man covered with blood half naked comes out of nowhere and jumps at his face scared to death the scientist pushes him away and
the man covered by blood falls on the ground and starts crying begging for help
the scientist doesnt have time to terrified the man covered with blood watches the scientists dead body fall to the ground revealing for a quick second a in the distance
the other scientists continue their work oblivious to the attack
kneeling behind a rock they make a what the hell is it
with his hand one of the scientists removes the dust around some skeletal remains
they look human
the strange shape of the bones and skull makes it impossible to tell whether they are human or animal
a shadow appears above them without turning around look what we found
blood splatters on the third man who steps back suffocating with fear behind his mask
the shadowy figure continues the assault on man finishing him off
powerless to stopthe massacre the last scientist runs away in a panic
at the top of the hill he appears out of breath
he doesnt have time to climb the rocks as he is pulled down screaming in his mask
the scientists jeep takes off dragging behind it the three bodies in their radiation suits and the dead body of the other man
a thick juicy steak lands on a hot skillet
while preparing dinner the perfect housewife presents the kitchen of tomorrow by praising all the benefits of nuclear energy
she is joined by her husband their children and their dog
the entire family sits at the table with big smiles
the frame freezes on this naive image of prosperity and well being
a slogan appears classified stock footage replaces the commercial these new images are of nuclear tests performed by the us army in the new mexico desert during the same period
old mining towns are evacuated by soldiers
their inhabitants are rounded up like cattle and loaded into trucks
somewhere else prefabricated towns filled with test dummies are eradicated by atmospheric explosions
caged animals used for experiments are carbonized by nuclear waves
scientists study the evolution of certain radiated species
in a split second gigantic craters are formed in the middle of the desert
explosions destroy everything in their path leaving behind only a giant nuclear mushroom beautiful and terrifying
the sharp outline of the hills appears with the first morning light
the sun begins to rise revealing a long deserted horizon stretching out endlessly
nothing lives in this and wilderness
a road curves through the desert terrain
on the side of the road at the bottom of a hill a gas station has survived years of wind and dust
around the main building a tool shed three gas pumps a dilapidated well a water tower and gutted carcasses of cars from the s accentuate the desolate feeling which prevails
in this place
a sign reads last stop for miles
a few tumbleweeds roll across the road
beams of light slice through the shutters
kriiink kronk a metal grinding noise is heard outside
kriiink kronk the noise becomes regular
in the darkness we discover a room hardly furnished
the withered and yellowed wallpaper flaps slowly in the draft
on the dresser dozens of empty liquor bottles
kriiink kronk on the bed the old gas station attendant lays with his back to the window
kriiink kronk the noise outside continues steadily without disturbing his sleep
kriiink kronk suddenly the old man wakes up short of breath and looks around trying to locate the noise
kriiink kronk he looks through the shutters then quickly puts on the top of his gas station overalls
he grabs a shotgun loading it swiftly
kriiink kronk the metal grinding noise increases as we move towards the gas station door
the door opens and the old man walks out holding his gun
silence has returned
the metal grinding is gone
the lever from the water well still moves
its just been hidden behind the house someone or something observes the old station attendant walking slowly to the well
water falls on the palm of his hand
worried the old man scans the surroundings
is that you
the sun is already high above the heat waves shimmering over the desert
the old gas station attendant moves away from the road towards the hills
he stops by a broken fence which is bent halfway to the ground
on a rusty sign next to an atomic symbol we can towards the hills on the side of the hill the entrance to a condemned he approaches the mine and
looks through the wooden planks barring its entrance
his echo is the only sound that can be heard from the depths
he aims the shotgun ready to open fire
behind the gas station someone observes the old man coming back to the house
an expensive leather bag was placed in front of his door during his absence
the old man looks around terrified
diligently he enters the house leaving the bag on the ground
on second thought the door reopens and the bag is dragged inside
the shutters are all closed leaving the station in darkness
the old man throws the leather bag on the dining table and sets down the shotgun
he takes a cigar from an ashtray and lights it
he grabs a whisky bottle
after a solid gulp he turns on a bare light bulb hanging over the table and stares at the bag in silence
one more swig for courage and the old man empties the bag on the jewels a swiss watch a dv cam glasses several cell phones a pager loose cash credit
cards a wallet
he grabs the wallet and pulls out a photo already sticking out
on the bent picture we see a young couple kissing
the young woman wears the same earrings found on the severed ear
the old man heaves a sigh before putting the wad of cash in his pocket
outside a voice is heard
the voice is followed by a car horn
the old man quickly gathers the objects from the table returning them to the bag
a airstream trailer home hitched to a chevrolet suv is parked in front of the gas station
big bob carter an imposing man in his late fifties stands outside the vehicle still honking the horn
the trailer home and suv with the american flag waving on the side completes the image big bob is an obvious cliche of the middle class republican father with a
touch of john wayne
where the hell is everybody
before he can finish his sentence the old gas station man appears
ah there you are
fill it up and check the fluids my friend
sure didnt take the fastest road
my crazy husband absolutely had to see the desert
nothing to see in the desert
big bob glares at the old man who fills up the tank while still chewing on his cigar
you know its illegal to smoke around a gas station
the old man bursts out in laughter revealing rotten teeth
inside the trailer home doug bukowski lynns husband tries to fix the broken a c
his glasses and white oxford shirt drenched in sweat doug is totally out of his element
this is a guy who has never been out of the city
using a phillips screwdriver he forcibly removes the front grill to access the mechanism
the heat and incessant barking wear on dougs nerves
piece of shit
why couldnt we fly like normal people
relax doug please
its their silver anniversary and theyre so happy youre here
please your parents cant stand me
they love you
we could have taken them on a cruise
yeah thats a great idea
why didnt you plan it
whats that supposed to mean
lynn grabs the milk bottle from its heater
maybe i shouldnt have even come
doug please stop
i never ask you for anything ok
she looks at the baby well see how happy you are when catherine comes along on our th anniversary
she walks out
it wont be in a shitty trailer home thats for sure
i heard that
in the back seat brenda sleeps against the window
a twig tickles her nose
without opening her eyes the young girl slaps her face as to chase away a fly
but the twig persists its her little brother bobby teasing her
linkin park blasts through his ipod
lynn knocks on the window interrupting his little game
if you want to use the restroom its now or never
bobby removes his headphones and pushes brenda
wake up lard ass
behind the gas station brenda plays with an albino piglet tied to a rope
bobby come look at this
bobby joins her
holding the animal oh my god
you two make a perfect pair
bobby turns to a rusty car and unzips to urinate
dont pee there
pointing to a small hello
god what do you care
bobby re zips and heads towards the small wooden outhouse while brenda plays with the baby pig
piggy piggy piggy
in front of the gas station lynn leans on the car giving catherine a bottle
big bob opens the hood while the old man continues to fill the tank
at the same time doug comes out of the trailer holding his cell phone
to the old man excuse me sir do you have a phone i can use
i cant get a signal around here and
big bob interrupts
the phone a rest bukowski
sorry bob duty calls
honey you havent put that phone down since we left
this is why i dont go on vacation
theyre lost without me
stop being at everyones beck and call bukowski
youre the boss remember
im sure all that important business can wait till next week
doug gives up
he kisses lynn and takes the baby from her
are you wearing sunblock
the suns so strong
while they are talking outside a deformed hand slides into the back window of the suv
it moves slowly snatching bobbys hooded sweater from the back seat
under the car the visitors feet walk way
they are bare dirty and covered with dust
rays of light pass through the wooden planks
the outhouse is so dirty that bobby is forced to hold his breath
an eye peeks between the wooden planks
what the hell brenda
the eye goes away
he re zips looking outside
when he exits brenda appears on the other side
she looks at him slightly confused
doug sits on the porch giving the baby her bottle
the old gas station attendant checks the oil and the water
ethel joins him holding a road map
how far are we from
youre at least six or seven hours awayfrom there
ethel gives her husband a dirty look
i told you we should have gone through santa fe
you never listen to me
this is the only southbound road that goes to
from there you can take the west to california
but youll never make it before sundown
doesnt bother me
i had night patrol for almost fifteen years
you a cop
with a smile not anymore
im starting a private security firm
the old man turns to doug you a cop too
im in telecommunications
make money in that
everybodys gotta have a cell phone
well you wont find any customers around here
as the old man closes the hood a familiar sound returns he leans over and catches bobby and brenda in the distance playing with the well
brenda is about to drink from her hands
shouting to them shell get sick
big bob walks to the old man
what do i owe you
the old man looks at the gas pump
let me pay bob
keep your money bukowski i can still afford
thats not what i meant
there is another room behind the counter and the beaded curtain which separates the two rooms is still moving
come on sweetie
cautiously lynn moves through the store to the beaded curtains
above the cash register an old sepia photograph of a miner stares at her
lynn goes into the other room
in the darkness among the old empty bottles she finds beauty standing with her front legs on a window sill and barking to the backyard
lynn looks outside nobody
only the desert and hills
inside the room the half open expensive leather bag laying alone on the table awakens her curiosity
as she goes to inspect it she hears the suv starting and doug calling out honey
lynn grabs the dog by the collar
come on beauty
theres nothing here
she turns around and runs into may i help you miss
sorry our dog got out
she wont stay put
a car horn breaks the silence
what are you doing
the old man lets her pass with the dog watching her with suspicion has she seen the contents of the bag
through the gas station window we see lynn leaving with the dog
outside next to the rusty abandoned cars the piglet has disappeared
only the rope remains
lynn puts the dog in the trailer where doug and bobby are
she enters the suv
behind the wheel big bob turns around one last time before driving off lets go
knock knock the old man knocks on the window
big bob opens isnt it illegal to have people in a trailer while youre driving my friend
hes right bob
im fully aware of the driving laws
have a safe trip
big bob smiles back and starts the engine
the old man stops him you know its not on the map but if you take a right at the road a couple miles from here itll lead you through
probably save you three or four hours
thanks for the tip
the trailer drives off in the distance leaving the attendant in a cloud of dust
the old man looks to the hills taking a deep breath
the camera passes through the wooden planks blocking the entrance and moves into the depths
pov through binoculars from the hilltops
the binoculars pan across the deserted terrain before stopping on the carter vehicle a tiny dot at the end of the road
the car and trailer approach
off screen we hear animalistic breathing behind the binoculars
the suv turns off the main road onto a dirt trail
we see brenda lifting the gate and allowing the vehicles to access the path unaware of the danger lurking about
brenda gets back in the suv
it pulls the trailer on the dirt road towards the hills
dinners on the way
goggle the man behind the binoculars talks into a walkie talkie
his voice is rough and deep
his pronunciation is poor and we cannot understand everything he says
in the walkie just got on the road
a chevy and a trailer
we see the scenery through the window blinds
on a wall photographs of other carter vacations are reminders of the good times spent in the trailer home
the thermometer reads above degrees
sweating doug hangs on while the camper bounces over the rough road
bobby works on the a c
he has removed the face plate and tries to fix the motor with the screwdriver
cleaning his glasses i tried for an hour but i couldnt get it cold in here
click the light turns on and the a c starts
a breeze of cool air circulates through the trailer
on the table two parakeets fly about their strapped down cage
it was nothing
the thermostat was disconnected
he turns to doug
how do you know all this stuff
i dont know
well at least we can breathe now
bobby sets down the screwdriver under the sleeper and sits next to the dogs
doug grabs a cigarette
i thought you stopped smoking
does my sister know
lighting it with a fuck her
big bob would kill you if he knew you were smoking in his airstream
fuck him too
you want one
doug extends the pack
bobby hesitates before reaching for one but doug pulls the pack away at the last moment
yeah right if you start smoking your sister would cut my nuts off
after a pause its cool that you came with us
its a drag when its just us and our parents
hey i like seeing your parents
bobby is surprised
under a too perfect blue sky the carter vehicles pass through the barren landscape lifting a cloud of dust
i think were somewhere on this blue road
mom were not on the blue road or any other road
he said it wasnt on the map remember
in the distance a lizard moves through some rocks before heading across the road unconcerned by the approaching car
dad you shouldnt have listened to that guy
look how beautiful it is here girls
the hills the colors
imagine the first people who crossed this desert
they had no idea where they were going
neither do we dad
on the road the lizard continues carving a dusty path
close up on the radio dial moving back and forth unsuccessfully in search of air waves
in the back seat brenda annoyed sits staring at the passing scenery
dont drive so fast bob you might lose the camper
this is fucked
watch your mouth young lady
to her husband will you please back me up here
calming things down relax mom
were all just tired
you grew up in the s
how can you be so uptight
still driving big bob turns to his daughters she wasnt like that before
you shouldve seen her when she was your age
to his wife do you remember honey
oh stop it
the lizard has almost crossed the road when shling
razor sharp metal spires come out of the ground slicing the lizard in two
a trap has been set a long chain of retractable spikes have emerged across the road
a few seconds later the sw drives over them at full speed
big bob loses control of the vehicle
the car rolls on the rims causing the trailer to almost flip over
inside doug loses his grip and is thrown against the side of the trailer
on the road the spikes retract disappearing into the ground
the chain of spikes slithers away in the dust like a snake
the dead lizard sliced neatly in half bakes in the hot sun
the dust slowly settles revealing the broken down vehicles
lynn jumps out of the car and runs to the trailer
are you alright
bobby opens the door releasing the barking dogs
dont worry were fine
what the hell happened
mom has her
i knew this wasnt gonna be safe for the baby
the heat must have caused a blow out
are you all right
i think so
just a little shaken up
bobby walks around the car evaluating the damage the suv tires are shredded the rims buried into the ground
i hope they have triple a out here
on the other side of the trailer brenda has gotten out and regained her senses
she takes a few steps taking in the land surrounding them
the lunar terrain of sand and rocks extends beyond the horizon
in the distance only the jagged hills are cut out against the sky
something ominous and indescribable lives in this place
behind the trailer doug walks off with his cell phone
nationwide coverage and we have to find ourselves in that
he searches desperately for a signal extending his arm forward
lynn grabs him tenderly by the waist
staring to the lifeless your father wanted to see the desert
i hope hes enjoying himself
on his knees by the suv tires big bob inspects under the vehicle
not only are the tires flattened but the front axel has buckled from hitting the rocks
how am i supposed to drive with you talking my ear off
im pulling a trailer on a dirt road and its degrees out here
behind him ethel walks with the baby who has stopped crying
oh so now its my fault
doug joins them
so whats the damage general
the damn axel is broken
can we fix it
the frame is completely twisted
give me your phone im gonna call a tow truck
i already tried
im not getting a signal
can we use the c b
that old thing
give it a try but this is mining country
whatever metal is left in those hills will probably scramble the signal
what are we going to do
without answering big bob gets back on his feet wipes his hands and grabs a bottle of water from the car
after a long were going to walk thats what
but were miles from cutting him off so we wait here for someone to drive by
have you seen a car in the last three hours
a hundred yards away bobby has come to retrieve the dogs
beauty and beast have stopped below a boulder extending twenty feet high
they bark and growl towards the top
i bet this desert is full of rattlesnakes
i saw a documentary on the discovery channel about desert snakes
if you get bit youll die in twenty minutes
big bob reaches into the glove compartment pulling out a mm and an extra clip
he hands it to his son
or was it five
bobby grabs the firearm pointing it to the desert
big bob grabs another gun from the car a chrome plated with a big smile id like to see how they stack up against this
ethel brings her husbands jacket and helps him put it on
some things never change
loading his weapon ill take my bullets over your prayers any day
you think well see scorpions and coyotes
bob grabs his son by the shoulders proud
they look like two kids getting ready to play cowboys and indians
bobby calls out to doug offering the gun hey doug wanna try
no thanks buddy
come on just one shot it makes you feel kinda powerful
big bob answers for doug leave him alone son
doug is a liberal he wouldnt touch a gun
obviously the two men disagree
behind the trailer brenda sits on a lounge chair in her bra revealing a sexy body
she applies suntan lotion ready to kill some time
behind her sunglasses she observes the silent desert looking like paris hilton
lynn exits the trailer and joins her
catherine just fell asleep
how are you holding up
thrilled to be here
yeah this is a total drag especially with a baby
i dont care what they say next year im going to cancun with my friends
no more family trips for me
were not going to have many more trips like this together
as for cancun youre gonna have to find a job
cmon with all the money your husband makes you could at least buy me a plane ticket
dont you think
please for your poor little sister
dougs voice interrupts
lynn can you bring me my jacket honey
lynn gets up and returns to the trailer
imitating her sister right away honey
without turning around lynn gives her sister the finger
brenda smiles with satisfaction
lynn finds her husbands jacket and stops when she sees a cigarette butt in the sink
she picks it up and throws it away
a flash of light catches her attention outside
she looks through the kitchen blinds and spots the quick reflection of light coming from the top of the hills when lynn falls back against
the kitchen table scared to death
bobby laughs pleased with himself
annoyed lynn shuts the blinds in his face
outside doug and big bob look at the road map laid out on the ground
ill keep walking north
this roads gotta lead somewhere
lynn comes around with the jacket and sees big bob and bobby both holding guns
what are you going to do with those
its always good to be prepared
are you taking a gun too
big bob answers for him
weve only got two and its better if you guys have one here
you never know
are you sure youre going to be alright
lynn puts a fishermans hat on doug to protect him from the sun and kisses him tenderly
if you dont find any help in six or seven miles come back
ill go to the gas station
its almost youll never be back before sunset
its only about ten miles from here
ill borrow that crazy old mans truck and use his phone if he has one
ill be back with a tow truck before nightfall
can i go with doug
stay here with your mother and sisters
and you dont tease your brother hes in charge now
holding the gun bobby winks at his sister who continues to sunbathe
ethel remains silent and worried
we should pray before you go oh please
is it really too much to ask
turning to her husband bob
bob finally agrees and like a good family man he gathers them around
brenda slips on her shirt and joins them
thank god nobodys watching us
in a lowered voice ethel recites a prayer
even though only ethel takes it seriously in that precise moment the arguing stops and the family seems united and strong
but seen from the surrounding summit through goggles binoculars the family looks small and vulnerable
behind them the sun begins to descend
catherine wakes up crying in her crib
hey little princess
who doesnt want to sleep anymore
the baby looks at her mother appeased
are you hungry my angel
lynn picks her up and exits the trailer
goggle grabs his s military walkie talkie
coast is clear
wait til it gets dark
on the radio papa jupes voice is deep and distorted
goggles binoculars pov on lynn she sits down with ethel unbuttons her blouse and breastfeeds
a table and fold out chairs are set up in front of the camper
lynn continues to feed catherine
you shouldnt go from the bottle to the breast
at her age she should get used to one or the other
mom thanks for the advice but shes my baby
vexed ethel remains quiet
its starting to get cold out here isnt it
trying to be nice i cant believe youre spending your anniversary stranded in the middle of nowhere
i can already see the headlines family found dead in new mexico desert
this place isnt so bad
at least the air is fresh
i think it stinks
better than cleveland
anythings better than cleveland
after a beat maybe it was my fault we had this accident
nothing can stop dad when he thinks hes found a shortcut
remember when we ran out of gas on the shortcut to the great lakes
how old was i
this family has certainly seen its share of adventures
if we had just stayed on the main road wed already be in california
yeah what id do for a shower and a margarita
a real bed
bobby sits down at the table
has anybody seen my grey sweatshirt
it was in the car
ive looked everywhere
i didnt touch your smelly sweatshirt
beast has been pulling on his chain nonstop while beauty cries softly from inside the trailer
why are the dogs so excited
probably some rattlesnakes not far away
you know how freud wouldve interpreted your obsession with rattlesnakes mom
ethel throws her kitchen towel at him
a beat then ethel becomes sentimental
brendas going off to college
and then next year its bobbys turn
the house is going to feel so empty
lynn grabs her mothers hand im really happy that were all together on this trip
brenda moves to the trailer
beauty is still barking inside
that makes one of us
they glare at her as she opens the door
brenda the dogs
beauty runs out in the direction of the hills bobby drops his plate and gives chase
worried ethel watches her son distance himself from the camper
bobby come back
beauty escapes to the hills
bobby runs as fast as he can but cannot keep up
the dog gets further and further away climbing up the side of the mountain
beauty moves through the first series of rocks
bobby loses sight of her and stops
out of breath he hesitates ahead the rocky horizon shows no indication of a definite path
he spots beauty climbing between some rocks and continues his chase
at the bottom of the hill the rocks are too jagged for him to continue running
he slows down and begins moving past the first set of rocks
with much more agility beauty climbs quickly towards the top disappearing behind some rocks
only sharp rocks stand before him
no doubt about it beauty found what she was looking for and it was much stronger
in the distance bobby hears his mother calling
a few feet from the trailer overcome with worry she turns to her two daughters
you think he can hear me
i dont know mom
she couldnt have gone that far
brenda notices the revolver on the table
bobby is unarmed
back to the hills back on a threatening mound of rocks
bobby must decide return to his family waiting by the trailer or continue his search for beauty
bobby hesitates then gathers his courage and decides to confront the hills
jagged rock after jagged rock bobby slowly climbs towards the summit
he appears between two big stones reaching an intermediate zone before the top a type of natural labyrinth formed in the rocks by years of erosion
bobby moves cautiously
he picks up a big stone for protection a dangerous animal could be hiding behind any corner
a shadow passes behind him
bobby doesnt notice
anaaaaaau a swift sound of breathing breaks the silence
bobby spins around ready to strike
just the labyrinth formed in the mountain
bobby is ready to give up when something attracts his a thin shadow on the ground
someone or something is hiding behind a rock
he stares at the shadow
who will make the first move
he makes the decision creeping towards the shadow
squeezing the stone he lifts his hand to strike but stops when he a young girl about wearing his stolen sweatshirt
she is about five feet tall and frail
the hood covers her head partly hiding her face
she is rather pretty even with her abnormally large eyes
she trembles frightened and intrigued by bobby
what is this girl doing in a place like this
dont be scared
i wont hurt you
what are you doing here
the girl keeps silent
bobby drops the stone to the ground but the young girl remains suspicious
so youre the one who took my sweatshirt
where did you find it
the young girl smiles shyly
the ice is broken
whats your name
the young girl hesitates and murmurs in a frail voice
what are you doing here ruby
where are your parents
my family needs help
we had an accident
ruby repeats her name mechanically as if she doesnt understand the questions
in a low voice ru
bobby gets closer
i heard you ruby
are you here alone
ruby wont answer
im looking for my dog
do you understand
her name is beauty
shes a german shepherd about this high
thats right have you seen her
ruby is beauty
the last sentence makes her laugh
a strange agonizing have you seen her
ruby looks down
she knows something
look at me ruby
look at me
where did you see my dog
ruby keeps looking to the ground
bobby reaches under her chin to raise her head
instinctively ruby screams as she backs off lifting her hands to protect herself
frightened bobby takes a step back
the girl murmurs softly
i cant understand
what are you saying
he comes closer trying to make eye contact as she continues to murmur the same thing
she too is terrified the hills
the hills have eyes
the hills have eyes
the hills have eyes
behind him a small rock slide grabs his attention
he turns his head
when he turns back to ruby she is gone
ruby come back
once more bobby is alone in the labyrinth
on the other side he finds a trail of blood as if a body had been dragged on the rocks
the bloody trail is still fresh and disappears behind another set of rocks a few feet away
bobby hesitates unsure of what he might find
as soon as hes around the outcropping to the other side bobby sees something that stops him dead in his tracks
before him on the ground is beauty
bobby drops to his knees disbelieving his face turning white
he touches the animals head as if to convince himself that this nightmare cant be possible at all
beautys face is locked in a grimace of horrible pain and shock
the animal is missing its front right leg
drops of blood fall on bobbys hand above him perched on a rock a figure observes him
a man with an impressive build crouches like a monkey
he wears old clothes covered with dust and a derby hat on his head
binoculars hang around his neck
goggle has no face as if it were totally covered with wax
he has two little holes for nostrils and no ears
his mouth is like an opened wound sliced in his skin
his eyes are the only features which give him any human resemblance at all
using his hand goggle devours something ferociously terrified bobby runs away
goggle laughs from his rock
bobby jumps down the hill
from the summit goggle continues feasting
a few yards away rubys slender silhouette slides between the rocks
goggle stops eating sees ruby and throws her the remains
ruby looks at the half eaten leg in disgust and pushes it away
rough and deep whats the matter ruby
you dont like dog anymore
moving at top speed bobby descends from the hills occasionally glancing behind him
he jumps from one rock to the next
anything to get out of this hellhole
he turns around one too many times and fails to see the sharp precipice ahead
he tries to stop but its too late
bobby slides down a few feet before grabbing hold of a protruding rock
the rock tears his skin
bobby tries to climb back up losing his grip
his head hits the bottom
he loses consciousness
behind him a rattlesnake slithers rattling its tail
the snake zips its tongue around his face when
with the hood of the sweatshirt still over her head ruby watches the wounded boy tenderly with her big abnormal eyes
close on the red sun on the horizon
we hear doug singing california dreaming a capella
all the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
ive been for a walk on a winters day
id be safe and warm if i was in l
after hours of walking down this road his face shows signs of fatigue
i was in la
the lyrics resonate throughout the desert
suddenly he stops singing
what the hell
a mound of earth blocks the road like a wall extending hundreds of yards on either side
confused doug approaches the wall and starts climbing
reaching the top he takes off his sun clips from his glasses and tries to grasp whats on the other side a huge atomic crater three hundred yards in
doug climbs down and wanders between the rusted vehicles
doug lights a cigarette before continuing his inspection
in the reflection of a shattered rear view mirror we see him approaching another car
dust completely covers the windows
doug wipes one down to he notices a baby seat still strapped to the back
the cars all seem to be in good condition as if they were simply pushed into the crater
he leans down towards another car barbed wire is rolled around the flattened tires
as doug looks around in confusion trying to figure out what this place might be the camera cranes up to a wide aerial shot revealing five or six others craters
its getting colder
lynn warms her hands at a fire in front of the trailer
a few feet away brenda collects firewood while calling out her brothers name
inside the camper ethel watches the sun set in the horizon
she cradles the baby in her arms
brenda joins lynn and throws some firewood into the flames
looking at the hills we shouldve gone looking for him when it was still light out
keep it together brenda mom is already worried enough
the fire will help bobby find his way back
what if he doesnt come back
maybe hes hurt
maybe there was an accident
he and beauty will find their way back together
lynn hugs her sister
i never thought it could be so cold in the desert
bobby was only wearing a t shirt when he left
clouds pass revealing an almost full moon
wind blows around the dark gas station
between the broken down cars we see big bob approaching on the road
a rusty tea pot sits on a pile of trash and whistles in the wind
by placing his hand on the spout big bob stops the whistling and silence returns
big bob walks to the porch
he knocks on the door
its bob carter i got some gas from you a couple of hours ago
big bob draws his gun and opens the door when from the other side of the house the whistling has stopped
after a few seconds the whistling returns
big bob shrugs it off and enters
holding his gun big bob steps into the empty gas station store
a faint light comes from the back room
the wind blows dust through the broken windows
vigilantly he moves through the empty shelves behind the counter and past the beaded curtain separating the two rooms
the light bulb above the dining table is on
big bob pushes the last door leading to the back room
his hand feels for the light switch
click an old lamp comes on in the corner
he finds a wall mounted phone and picks up the receiver
through the window big bob sees a pick up truck
he starts searching for the keys
going through the different rooms he discovers a drawer full of money jewels watches credit cards
a real fortune
he spots a key chain hanging from a nail next to the desk
he reaches for the keys when something else grabs his attention partially hidden in the dark he discovers a few family photos and a few newspaper clippings from the s
pinned to the wallpaper
big bob lights the desk lamp and turns it towards the wall his face goes cold on the aged photos we recognize the old gas station attendant in his younger
days next to his wife and his
cleft lips tumors uneven extremities malformations skin diseases and gangrene of the face
on a more recent polaroid we can recognize ruby at years old
besides her three fingers and big eyes half of her skull is missing or caved in
another polaroid in a wheelchair a little boy has difficulty holding up his hugely disproportionate head
the headline from the clippings makes big bob understand the origins of these horrors new mexico nuclear enters a new age
miner town evacuated miners refuse to abandon their lands by hiding in military destroys miners town
the old mans family was
one of those families whose genetic lineage was forever changed by the nuclear fallout
big bob is shocked never believing such a thing was possible
you son of a bitch
worried for his own family he grabs the keys and walks out
from the bedroom window we see him running to the pick up truck
big bob slams the door starts the engine and turns on the headlights
the headlights shine on the outhouse
the wooden outhouse door slams back and forth in the wind
something blocks it from shutting completely
big bob exits the vehicle holding his gun and approaches
a voice comes to him
a man sobbing through his tears big bob kicks open the door revealing aiming his gun at him the old man seems mad
lifting his eyes to big my wife
she didnt want to leave
she wouldnt move to town even when the state police ordered us to
the kids grew up in the mines
smiling through his what kind of place is that for children
in a split second the old man sets the shotgun under his
suddenly voices coming from different directions echo around him
the voices are horrific and terrifying
big bob backs up pointing his gun in their direction
big bob cant contain his fear and shoots blindly into the darkness
the voices become louder and louder omnipresent
big bob walks backwards to the truck and trips on the ground
wide eyed he stands and throws himself on the car door
panicked he enters the vehicle and turns the ignition
as the engine turns over daddy
in a split second big bob sees in his rear view mirror a its papa jupiter
the truck shakes as big bob is attacked inside
blood splatters on the windows
bloodied and screaming big bob is dragged out of the car in the dirt to the entrance of the old mine behind the gas station
big bob disappears inside
the night is once again calm and silent
miles away inside the trailer ethel washes dishes while dinner cooks on the stove
she wipes her hands on her apron and site down next to the radio
into the mic hello
can somebody hear me
please answer if you hear me
the radio goes silent
lynn joins her holding the baby
hows it going
i heard something
she fiddles with the radio
im not even sure i know how to use this thing
lynn hands her catherine and sits in front of the c b
in the mic mayday
this is a distress call
do you copy
lynns distress call is heard from the trailer isolated in the middle of the desert
were stranded in the desert we need help
suddenly the light on the c b turns green and static can be heard
ethel grabs her daughters hand hopeful that someone may have heard them
a second later heavy breathing is heard over the radio
the light turns off
the two women look at each other in confusion
what was that
it sounded like an animal
lynn stands up worried
if animals start answering our radio calls were really fucked
watch your language
give it a rest mom
we have more important things to worry about
she walks out
ethel stays alone with the baby
still tied to the trailer beast growls and pulls on his chain
lynn raises the collar of her jacket to protect herself from the wind and moves closer to the fire
in the distance we see brenda looking for her brother
with a flashlight in one hand the gun in the other and a blanket over her shoulders brenda moves through the night
she hears her older sister calling
ill be back in a minute
the flashlight partially lights the desert as she disappears into the night
we fly over the hills before stopping over bobbys unconscious body laid out between two rocks
ruby is still at his side observing him silently
she hears brendas calls and runs away
bobby slowly opens an eye regaining his senses
blood has coagulated on his face
he turns his head in the direction of his sisters voice realizing that its night
how long has he been unconscious
the sky is so clear that you can see the milky way above the carters trailer home
beast strains on his chain a low growl of rage coming from his chest
inside the trailer the first aid kit is open on the table
even with a blanket around his shoulders bobby shivers
ethel soaks cotton in alcohol using it to clean his wounds
youre lucky brenda found you
imagine if you had to spend the whole night out there in the cold
bobby winces from the pain
dont worry beauty will come back when shes hungry
bobby doesnt answer
he keeps the truth to himself not wanting to worry his family
have you tried the radio
it doesnt work
we heard something
some sort of breathing
bobby lifts his head
what do you mean
it was really weird right mom
minimizing the incident im sure it was just static
mom it sounded like a perverted crank call
only mom would get an obscene phone call out here
suddenly a muted sound echoes outside
bobby jumps up grabs the gun and crouches behind the door
to the others ssshhhh
his mother and two sisters are surprised by his agitated behavior
whats wrong with you
stern but soft i want you guys to stay in here
you hear me
gun in hand he opens the door bobby is about to shoot when a figure emerges from the dark
its doug holding as much as he could carry from the car graveyard
what the fuck are you doing
dont point that thing at me
bobby lowers the weapon
i didnt know it was you
who else would it be
bobby is interrupted by brenda who sees doug from the window
quickly lynn exits the trailer and jumps into her husbands arms
doug sets down all of his findings
look what i found
various tools a fishing pole
with all of this we can find a way to fix the car right bobby
bobby doesnt answer
i found this really huge crater at the end of the road
ive never seen anything like it
people must use it as a dump site
it was full of all this garbage
pointing to the fishing look at this its brand new
what are you going to do with a fishing pole in the desert
you didnt you find anybody
the road just stops there
i hope your dad has better luck
is there anything to eat
lets go its freezing out here
doug follows lynn inside the trailer
bobby stays outside worried
everything seems calm
perhaps too calm
he looks around beast is gone
he finds the broken chain
at the top of the hill beast has found whats left of beautys mutilated body and whines as he licks her face
from outside we see doug and lynn finishing dinner while brenda clears the table
doug holds catherine on his knees
outside bobby stands guard with the gun
his mother comes out
looks like were camping out tonight
hows your head
bobby doesnt answer
whats going on
are you sure
ill feel a lot better when dad gets back
me too honey
youve already spent enough time in the cold for one day dont you think
bobby agrees to follow his mother abandoning the fire
the flames dance with the desert wind in the night
bobby double bolts the lock on the door
behind him lynn comes out of the bathroom while doug has just changed catherine
dont close the door were leaving in a second
where are you going
you dont want to wait until dad comes back
im tired i really need to rest for an hour or so
we can squeeze in here
youll be more comfortable
you want us to sleep on the floor
doug kisses catherine and hands her to brenda so she can put her to bed
bobby takes him aside
i need to talk to you
bobby hesitates to talk
so what bobby
lynn walks by im almost ready
im sure your dad will be back soon
hes big bob
its gonna take more than a few snakes in the dark to stop him right
are you coming honey
lynn holding a blanket and pillows joins him
they exit together hand in hand
if hes not back by midnight well go get him
bobby hates himself for not saying anything
he bolts the door shut and stands facing it
behind him brenda sets the baby in her crib and starts a fisher price mobile hanging above setting off the music and rocking the baby to sleep
she disappears in the bathroom for a moment and comes out in t shirt and panties
she turns to her brother can i listen to your ipod
bobby is still focused on the door
can i borrow your ipod
brenda grabs it and cranks the volume
she starts swaying to the music unaware of the dangers lurking about
next to her catherine sleeps quietly in her crib
on the other side of the trailer ethel works on a crossword puzzle
insert family revenge homicide
are some of the words in the puzzle
wider bobby joins her and sits
in between some bushes we see the carter trailer home isolated in the desert under the starlit sky
backlit in the window brenda dances
next to the trailer home the suv in a makeshift bed in the back doug is laying on his back and lynn rubs his legs
yeah right there
god i feel like i crossed new mexico on foot
amused lynn squeezes his legs a bit harder
she moves up to his love handles
a little work out cant be all that bad for these guys right
doug laughs and giggles
stop youre tickling me
lynn continues with more fervor
oh so you want to play
he turns around and starts tickling her as well
they laugh together before kissing passionately
i love you
i love you too
they start making out
at the same time a hand opens the gas tank and unscrews the cover
in total silence the hand slips a rubber hose into the tank and starts siphoning gas
we follow the hose up to the monstrous mouth of pluto the deformed bald giant with a childs face
but a child with a thick primal cruelty snapping in his asymmetrical protruding eyes
silently pluto siphons some of the carters gas into a gas can
lynns hand presses against the window as she and her husband continue unaware
pluto laughs stupidly excited by the situation
his large smile reveals pointy shark like teeth
once the gas can is full he waves at somebody hidden in the dark
brenda rests on her bed
exhausted she turns off the bed lamp
and slides under the sheets
she falls asleep listening to the music
in the other room of the trailer bobbys watch reads pm
bobby is restless
he doesnt know what to do
a few feet away ethel sleeps on the couch
suddenly bobby hears barking in the distance
he grabs the gun and exits the trailer leaving the door open
bobby moves into the night
beast is still barking somewhere in the dark
as he passes the suv he overhears the moaning and heavy breathing coming from inside
his flashlight moves over the desert terrain and the occasional bush
he calls out to his dog trying not to wake anyone
come on boy
you hear me
come on now
bobby moves further from the trailer towards the barking
bobby shines the light on the bush and approaches nothing
it must have been his imagination
the barking becomes a ferocious growl
all of a sudden the growling becomes a mooing cow
then a goat
then a chicken
terrified bobby turns around and runs back toward the suv
in the living room ethel sleeps
at the other end brenda turns under the sheets
the muted bass coming from the ipod drums on in the background
he stands above brenda watching her sleep an innocent smile on his face
his hand softly grazes her hair as if she was a kitten then pulls on the sheets to expose her body
pluto covers her mouth silencing her
brendas eyes open panting and panicked bobby knocks on the suvs tailgate window interrupting lynn and doug
caught red handed lynn dresses and doug pulls up his pants
what is it now
through the window what do you want bobby
come on open up
lynn opens the back window giving him a dirty look
this had better be important
bobby is too scared to keep the truth hidden
he regains his calm before talking
somethings going on around here
were not alone
exasperated lynn takes a deep breath not taking him seriously
i know this sounds weird but there are people living in those hills
were in the middle of nowhere
believe me no one could survive out here
i saw them
they cut out her insides
what are you talking about
her guts were all over the place
he struggles to talk
i didnt want to scare you so i didnt say anything but somethings going on
you even said you heard some breathing on the radio didnt you
were not alone im telling you
doug exits the car
obviously bobby is not kidding
calm down bobby ok
lets go check it out together
lynn stay right here
from the window we can see bobby and doug walking to the trailer
in the back room pluto hears them grabs his walkie talkie noaowww
at that moment an explosion takes place a few hundred yards away from the trailer
the flames climb into the air lighting the surrounding rocky desert
doug and bobby turn around
he has been crucified to a joshua tree and transformed into a the explosion and the screaming has awakened ethel who comes out of the trailer in her nightgown
recognizing his screams she runs to her burning husband
doug tries to hold her back but she is determined to get to him
doug runs into the trailer grabbing a fire extinguisher and some blankets
in the panic he fails to see brenda restrained by pluto
brenda stay with catherine
he jumps out without waiting for an answer
pluto gives brenda a satisfied smile no one will bother them doug runs out leaving the door wide open
someone jumps from the roof and on all fours lands in front of the door
he stands and for the first time we see the face of lizard plutos cousin
lizard is as thin as pluto is imposing
extremely pale his face is disfigured by a cleft lip which exposes his deformed lizard has big bobs magnum
he enters the trailer and closes the door behind him
big bob screams as the flames devour his naked flesh
his fingers tighten
his bloodied face distorts with pain
even his eyes are burnt
considering the condition of his body its a miracle hes still alive
doug arrives with the extinguisher and begins putting out the fire under ethels horrified watchful eye
back inside the trailer
with a wicked smile on his face lizard puts on ethels apron and places her flowery sun hat on his head
this disturbed mind takes pleasure in dressing up in mamas clothes
then famished he eats everything he can find in the trailer
raw meat fruit potato chips
he washes it all down with milk orange juice
his eyes stop on the bird cage
lizard moves closer opens the cage and grabs one of the parrakeets
the small bird looks around in confusion
blood drips on his chin
brendas muted screams attract his attention
lizard walks across the trailer
he wants his share
he pushes pluto violently to the ground
with a smile you gotta be a man to do that
pluto is outraged and tries to stand up
he wants to talk but no words come out
just grunts and growls
lizard savagely hits him several times
behind them terrified brenda watches helplessly as they fight
lizard puts his foot on plutos face pinning him to the ground and then points the gun to his head
i told ya to move
pluto moves away and in a fit of rage breaks everything in the trailer
dishes chairs table
lizard laughs like a goon
he grabs brenda by her feet and pulls her to him
excited and amused at the same time he stares at brendas appetizing calf muscle
he smells it licks it and then without hesitation plunges his teeth into her leg
brendas muted screams are heard from inside the trailer
the flames have been replaced by white smoke
doug unties big bob
his body falls motionless to the ground
smoke comes out of his mouth
doug uses the blanket to extinguish the last flames
behind doug ethel looks at her husband refusing to accept the truth
its not possible
thats not bob
thats not my bob
she grabs doug by his shirt trying to convince him
its not him
tell me its not him
its not my bob
the poor woman has lost her mind
ethel erupts in laughter pointing to her dead husband
that is not my bob
that is not my bob
thats not him
lynn and bobby are paralyzed
doug turns to his wife
take your mother away from here
with her eyes fixed on her father lynn walks her mother away
in bobbys eyes sadness has been replaced by hatred
full of rage the youngster grabs the gun and walks away
where are you going
im gonna take care of the motherfuckers
come back here bobby
bobby disappears into the night
doug covers big bobs face with a blanket
returning to the trailer lynn struggles to restrain ethel
ethel finally realizes its too late for her husband and collapses into her daughters arms
just then a muffled scream from brenda pierces the night
oh my god
lynn runs inside leaving her mother alone
bursting into the trailer lynn stops on a dime when she sees lizard in ethels clothes holding the baby
behind him pluto restrains brenda
lizard walks up with the baby
big fat baby good
fat and juicy
lynn is paralyzed with fear
lizard imitates a mother cradling her baby
instinctively lynn grabs the closest thing a frying pan and hits lizard brutally in the face
stunned he falls to the ground and drops the baby who begins to wail
when he lifts his head lynn strikes again he blocks her arm and twists it bringing her to her knees
lynn tries to fight him off but he is too strong
still restrained brenda spots the phillips screwdriver under the sleeper
the one bobby had used to fix the a c
at the other end of the trailer lizard has immobilized lynn and points the gun at the baby
without a word lizard tears off lynns shirt and bra
the gun stays pointed at the baby as lizard removes ethels sun hat and hovers over lynns breast
seen from behind her shoulder we cant figure out exactly what this mental case is doing
is he nursing from her breast
lynn trembles but can only think of her baby and her sister who are still threatened
excited by what his brother is doing pluto fondles brenda
suddenly ethel jumps into the trailer with a broom and starts batting away at lizard
for once her adrenaline kicks in as she fights for the most important thing in her life her family
the broom has little effect and is almost comical
lizard shoots ethel in her chest throwing her back
from far away bobby hears the gunshot
he quickly turns around to help his family
in the trailer home brenda takes advantage of the confusion to get away from pluto and grabs the phillips screwdriver from beneath the sleeper
brenda slides the screwdriver to lynn who raises it and is about to strike when bang
lynn is shot in the chest
lizard turns to brenda and aims at her head
he is about to shoot when lynn with her last breath lizard screams in pain and turns the gun back to lynn bang
he blows off part of her skull
blood splatters throughout the cabin
alarmed by the gunfire doug gets up and looks at the trailer in the distance
he doesnt know what to do
bobby appears behind him come on doug
theyre in the trailer
they both take off running
witness to the slaughter brenda is petrified with fear
lizard pulls out the screwdriver and stands with difficulty
he picks up the baby and hands it to pluto
lizard grabs brenda by the hair and pulls her out of the trailer
come on bitch
she screams and resists by grabbing at furniture and pulling off the curtains
her nails scratch against the paneling
brenda is pulled out by lizard
when he sees bobby and doug approaching lizard changes his brenda is wide eyed
without hesitating lizard pulls the click
no more bullets
lizard drops brenda
ill come back for ya
lizard disappears into the night
brenda lays on the ground trembling and crying
doug arrives at the trailer while bobby aims the mm at the assassins
its too late
bobby runs to his traumatized sister laying on the ground
he holds her in his arms trying to calm her down
doug approaches the open door
he notices bloody hand prints along the side of the trailer home one of the attackers has been hurt
doug enters the trailer unable to imagine the tragedy
horrified he discovers ethel on the couch not quite dead but short of breath and in pain
doug is stone faced his eyes fill with tears
he tries to keep from crying but his sadness is too deep
his hand approaches her face
his fingers graze her hair
doug tries to breathe life back into her body but death has overtaken her open eyes
he closes them and starts weeping
the music from the fisher price mobile is the only other sound
doug turns around
the crib is empty
he squeezes his fist with rage
at the foot of the burnt tree big bobs body is laid out on some rocks the blanket over his face
a few figures emerge out of the darkness and gather around the body like a pack of hyenas
backlit by the moon at the top of the hill we find goggle and his binoculars
reflecting in the lenses we see the carters trailer glowing in the night
a rustling noise attracts his attention
before goggle can turn around a wild animal jumps at his face its beast
the german shepherd tears at goggles face and locks deep into his throat
goggle tries to fight it off but the animal is determined to kill
goggle grabs an old razor out of his pocket and tries to cut the animal
the dog bites down tightening its grip
he drops the razor
goggles derby hat falls between some rocks
someone calls him on the on walkie talkie goggle
goggle will not answer anymore
laid out on the couch ethel agonizes between life and death
brenda stares into space saying nothing
doug touches her head as he passes
instinctively she backs off terrified
across the trailer bobby paces back and forth
what are we going to do doug
what are we going to do if they come back
completely defeated doug comes back and goes to ethels side
doug does not answer and takes ethels hand
she opens her eyes and looks at him as if nothing happened
this campers so small
no matter how much you clean its always a mess
doug nods in silence
is big bob home
did everyone go to bed
yes brenda is here and bobby is in the kitchen
at the other end bobby turns away crying
brenda looks away as well
short of breath is lynn sleeping
doug holds back the tears
after a beat do you need anything
ethel finds it more and more difficult to talk
look in the closet doug im sure i have another blanket
im so cold
doug tucks one of the blankets around her
theres one here
nice and warm
youve always been so sweet
i understand why lynn loves you so much
she raises her arm to caress his face
her hand falls on the bed
brenda screams bursting into tears
at the same time bobby pounds his fist against a wall
his eyes full of hate he joins doug
im not going to take this shit
doug gets mad as well
you stay here
im going after them
doug gets between bobby and the door preventing the kid from leaving
let me go
you want to die too
i dont care
doug drags him in front of his mothers body
look at what they did to your mother
look at what they did to your sister
he slams bobby against the door
youre not a fucking child alright
think before you do something stupid
you wont make it three feet
we need a plan ok
we need to think
think about what
they have catherine doug
doug remains silent
they have catherine
you know what they could to do to her and youre not going to stop them
youre just a coward
doug jumps back on bobby grabbing him by the collar
they all freeze
doug releases bobby and immediately turns off the light
plunged in darkness brenda panics again no
dont turn it off
he swore hed come back to get me
he swore it
dont let him take me bobby
outside another noise and a shadow passes backlit by the bobby picks up the gun bang
with no hesitation he shoots through the door
brenda throws herself into dougs arms
bobby stares at the bullet holes in the trailer door
suddenly the sound of a radio is heard goggle you copy
bobby and doug look at each other confused
doug silently moves closer to the door
from outside we can see dougs eye through one of the bullet holes
nobody everything seems quiet
get ready bobby
doug opens the door and jumps out ready to fight
from beneath the trailer someone observes him
doug bends down and discovers goggles severed arm
in its hand the walkie talkie still works
doug grabs the radio
its dripping with blood
bobby is about to join him when doug signals without a sound bobby aims the gun at the kitchen floor
outside doug backs up to see who is hiding
behind the step ladder he sees an inert shape in the shadows
bobby shoots through the floor
immediately the shadowy figure jumps out into the light beast
the dog jumps into dougs arms and begins licking his face
bobby cant believe it his dog has returned
radio static comes back on the walkie
bobby picks it up papa jupe
goggle is dead
i found him in the rocks
they got him
hes all torn up
bobby is proud of beast
still in the trailer brenda looks at them not as hopeful
thats a good dog
im gonna take care of those bastards myself
bobby exchanges a worried glance with doug
even though neither of the two has yet met papa jupe something in his voice tells them that its only going to get worse
doug grabs the radio in the radio no answer
give me back my little girl
give her back to me
suddenly we hear doug drops the radio scared speechless
how much ammo do you have left
i dont know half a clip
on a dimly lit wooden table catherine lays wrapped in a blanket
a butchers knife is planted next to her
asthmatic breathing and the sound of running water punctuate the silence
ruby steps out of the darkness and moves towards the baby
she watches through her abnormally large eyes and extends her stringy fingers to touch the baby
a large screen splits the room in two
a strangely shaped shadow moves behind the screen a handicapped body washed by a large woman
an empty wheel chair rests in a corner
amused ruby looks at the baby who smiles back
she carefully takes catherine in her arms when the invalids voice put that down ruby
you know better than to play with your food
ruby takes a step back hugging the baby tighter
weak asthmatic voice listen to your mother ruby and put that baby down
frightened ruby obeys and quickly runs out of the room
the baby starts crying
brenda sits by the c b and retries the sos calls
we need help mayday
can anybody hear me
something has gone off in her eyes
she is absent no longer living just surviving
doug is about to leave taking with him anything from the trailer which might be useful
let me go with you
no you stay here with your sister and stay by the radio
somebodys bound to hear us
brenda continues her distress call
can anybody hear me
the sunll be up soon
one of them is hurt im going to follow his trail through the hills
bobby pulls out the mm gun and hands it to him
you keep it in case they come back
what about you
dont worry about me ill take beast
beast sits at his feet ready to go
doug straps the walkie talkie over his shoulder
i didnt mean what i said
doug hugs him like a brother
before walking out he bends down to lynns body and kisses her one last time on the mouth
im going to find
our baby my love
the first sign of dawn lights the distant horizon
the vultures perched on a dead joshua tree swivel their heads around to see a distant running figure doug and beast moving steadily among the rocks
doug and beast arrive at the old mines entrance on the side of the hill
the trail of blood leads inside
doug hides behind a rock
sweating he catches his breath
beast breathes heavily as well
doug remembers what his wife always used to say to the dog i told you to stop smoking
doug sets a different frequency on his radio into the walkie bobby
you read me
i followed the blood im in front of a mine
im not sure if ill get a signal from inside
if you dont hear from me in a half an hour youre on your own
good luck doug
he puts the walkie away and takes out the flashlight
you ready big guy
i hope youre not afraid of the dark
he pets the dog one final time and stands up
with the light from the entrance behind him shadow enters the mine
the beam from his flashlight follows the trail of blood on the ground
the wooden pylons which have held up the walls for a hundred years threaten to crumble at any second
only static on the radio
doug turns it off
he moves further into the darkness probing with his flashlight into the inky pit
doug arrives at a fork splitting the tunnel off in two different directions
doug lights each tunnel with the flashlight until he finds the one with the blood trail then continues on into that one
suddenly he stops
the beam of the flashlight has revealed two dozen pickaxes that have been planted in the ground over mounds
that look very much like graves
the pickaxes look eerily like crosses given the whole place the feel of a subterranean graveyard
hanging from the graves dates and portraits of all the miners who have died here including women and children
the flashlight dims
doug taps it to no avail
you cant be serious
then light goes
completely off leaving doug in darkness
he lights a match
holding the tiny flame doug continues down the tunnel until he arrives at another fork
he can no longer see the blood trail
to beast meaning just stay calm boy
a gust of air kills the match
he immediately lights another again the draft snuffs it out
he turns around looking for the source of the air and notices a reflection of light at the end of the tunnel
he moves towards the reflection
on the other side of the hill the collapsed wooden beams and stones block part of the mines exit
doug emerges with beast
his eyes takes a moment to adapt to the bright sunlight
cannot believe what he sees
at the bottom of a hill a doug turns the walkie on
bobby bobby its doug
i cant believe it
i found a street and some houses
maybe somebody does live here
the radio remains silent
bobby do you hear me
doug turns around and looks up a wall of rock towers behind him
he tries one last time but the signal wont go through
close up on the c b radio in the trailer only static comes from the speakers
brenda drags one of the tires from the suv feet away
she douses it with lighter fluid and whoosh
a match sets it on fire creating a thick black smoke signal
brenda joins her brother who is busy planting wooden stakes in a circle fifty meters around the trailer
maybe somebody heard our calls
nobodys going to find us brenda even with that smoke
you heard what doug said were alone now just you and me
let them come im waiting for them
now bobby stretches the nylon wire from the fishing pole around each stake
he sets the fishing pole next to the trailer rigging to it one of catherines toy shakers an improvised alarm system
at the summit somebody observes the trailer and the thick cloud of smoke rising to the air
doug runs down the hills towards the town
behind him from the mouth of the mine someone observes between the rocks its ruby
doug slows his pace as he enters main street
the town is deserted
no sign of life anywhere
all the houses and cars are covered with a thick layer of dust
taking a closer look he realizes all the parked cars are from the s
uncertain doug walks through the ghost town with beast at his side
no movement besides the wind blowing and lifting an occasional cloud of dust
doug walks up to a house and knocks on the front door
no one to open the door
doug wipes one of the windows its too dark inside to see anything
the door is unlocked doug pushes it
it squeaks open
he hesitates before entering
sunlight passes through the dusty windows revealing a living dining room decorated from the s
doug cant believe his eyes through the kitchen door he can see a woman doing dishes
a man sits in the living room reading a newspaper
children play in front of the blank tv set
they have been dressed and placed into real life situations
doug spots a telephone behind the staircase and checks for a dial tone
he picks up the phone casing
doug quickly crosses main street to visit another house
new interior new surreal setting
around a table a family of test dummies eat dinner
stupefied doug enters yet another house
the door remains open as we see another family of dummies living a perfect little life
a life which stopped in the around the corner of a house a little girl dummy is sitting on a swing her face half broken
a second later doug thinks he hears children laughing
he nothing but the wind blowing through the houses
doug takes catherines bib from his pocket and lets beast get its scent
find her beast find catherine
with his nose to the ground the dog pulls doug straight ahead
doug walks away through the streets pulled by the dog
on the outskirts of town we discover a fence buried in the sand
on it an old metallic sign reads the scent leads doug into an alley off the main street
he sees an old generator on full throttle
a thick smoke pours from the exhaust
his daughter could be there
doug tries to see into the windows but they are caked in filth
he decides to go around when immediately doug backs away
the man drags a cadaver by its feet
half of the dead body is missing having apparently been torn off
the man turns around revealing his horrible face a metallic brace is screwed on four sides of his head helping him stand straight
enormous cysts disfigure him and cover every visible part of his body
lets call him cyst
cyst traces back his steps trying to find what caused the noise
he holds the gas station attendants shotgun
the alley is empty
the generators are still motoring
all seems normal
cyst turns back towards main street
cyst passes an oldparked car without seeing doug and the dog hidden inside
doug breathes a sigh of relief
quietly doug gets out of the car
he hesitates as to whether he should bring beast with him or to leave him in the car
the dog could be his best weapon but on the other hand he also represents a bigger risk to be spotted
you wait here beast
come on sit
im gonna find catherine
the dog is confused and whines through the half opened window
ill be back
he closes the car door and starts down the alley lowering his head
from inside the car beast watches doug getting further away
doug sneaks along the side of the building towards the front door
he hesitates unsure of what awaits him inside doug crosses a doorway without making a sound
he enters the front hall squeezing the bat in his hands
something in the air a disgusting smell catches his attention
doug moves slowly and discovers in the dining room sitting amongst the dummies his father in laws arms have been torn off and devoured
the american flag that used to adorn his suv is planted through doug approaches terrified
oh say can you see by the dawns early light what so proudly we hailed at the twilights last gleaming
doug jumps and quickly lifts the baseball bat ready to swing
just the fake living room filled with inert dummies
no trace of his baby
an electrical fan turns in a corner close to a shelve full of old books
doug moves forward gripping the bat tightly
feeble and asthmatic
whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight
he can hear his own heart beat as he searches through the house
in another room close to the window and in the shadows he sees someone sitting in a wheelchair
and the rockets red glare the bombs bursting in air
doug gets closer a ray of light shines on the skull of whoever sits in the wheel chair
the wheel chair moves forward revealing a most horrific sight big brain we recognize the handicapped man whom we have seen before bathing behind the screen
big brains body is skeletal
he was born with a genetic disease giving him a head ten times bigger than his face
a head so heavy he is unable to hold it up
it rests back on his chair forcing him to stretch his eyes to see from side to side
big brain is maybe the most representative character of the damage done by nuclear fallout in this area
doug threatens him with the baseball bat wheres my baby
big brain does not answer
what did you do with her
doug is beyond his breaking point where is she then
he raises the bat
weak and asthmatic i dont know where she is
i never leave this place
big brain moves away from the window wheeling himself to the couch
his hands are thin and pale like a childs
you shouldve read the signs before taking that road
boom what the hell are you saying
weak and asthmatic you people settled on our lands you destroyed our homes destroyed our silver mines
you ye made us what weve become
one day my father went into town begging for your help and you know what the doctors did
they sterilized him like a dog
you thought that in the desert no one would see anything or say anything but the hills
the hills never forget
i dont know what youre talking about
all i want is my daughter
big brain remains silent
what do you want
i can give you money
what do you want
maybe a trailer
yeah a pretty trailer just like yours
where are the others
where is my baby
big brain starts laughing a high pitched sound
whats so funny
at the same moment like a wild animal pluto charges doug destroying everything in his path
doug retreats in the living room throwing the dummies at his assailant
the giant comes closer and closer
dummies are chopped into pieces
doug dodges away and tries to escape using the stairs in the hallway but the giant grabs him by the feet and pulls him down
the axe swings through the air missing him by a hair each time
sensing his master is in trouble beast jumps around inside the car trying to find an exit
the passenger window opening is too small for him to break out
doug runs into another room escaping from pluto and his axe
instinctively he uses the first piece of furniture he can find a chest to block the door behind him
he looks desperately for an exit
no way out
the axe penetrates through the door
the chest wont be enough to hold back pluto
second axe blow this time the axe tears up the boards of the door allowing pluto to stick his gruesome face inside
seeing doug trapped in the room the bald giant begins to laugh stupidly before turning around and walking away
the house is now silent
no sign of the giant
with his heart pounding through his chest and the baseball bat in hand doug moves towards the half broken door
doug loses his bat but slides away before the axe comes swinging down
desperate he picks up the bat and uses it as a shield
the axe splits it in half
doug throws himself at pluto plunging the splintered bat into his abdomen
the sharp piece of wood enters plutos stomach
completely out of his mind pluto removes the piece of wood from his abdomen and beats doug in the face with it sending him across the room
pluto lowers his head charging doug like a bull
doug crashes into one of the walls
he cant even take a breath before the giant grabs him by the leg like a rag doll and throws him through a wall
doug falls to the ground in the living room
wounded and exhausted he is also defenseless
he has lost his glasses
not far away big brain savors the spectacle
the giant walks to him spinning the axe in his hand like a baton
his foot crushes dougs glasses on the floor
the axe swings through the air
doug jumps out of the way
doug stares wide eyed at his amputated fingers and screams with pain
blood is everywhere
in an act of self preservation doug crawls under the table
pluto destroys it with the axe and advances to finish him off
his asymmetrical eyes stare coldly doug is at his mercy
pluto slowly caresses the axes blade on his victims throat and face
the sharp blade moves dangerously across dougs skin
pluto stops when he sees doug holding his phillips screwdriver
pluto laughs like a dumb child at the feeble weapon
behind him big brain joins in on the laughter disfigured by his wounds doug is frozen with the screwdriver pointed at the giant
he looks ridiculous and starts sobbing like a terrorized child
please im begging you
dont kill me
making fun of him loook at t hiiis fa ace
loook at at hiiis fa ace
even the frozen faces of the test dummies seem to mock him
doug stops crying instantly it was a trick
he turns the screwdriver around and slams it into plutos foot
the screwdriver goes through the shoe nailing pluto to the floor
pluto screams in pain
doug rises and moves behind him
in a swift movement doug takes the american flag from big bobs forehead stabbing pluto in the back of the neck
pluto screams again dropping the axe
outraged pluto tears the flag from his neck and turns to doug
the blade swings through the air and slams into plutos skull
plutos eyes freeze and his body falls to the ground his skull half open
doug jumps on top of him
full of rage he big brain watches pluto die without showing any emotion
silence returns to the destroyed house
doug tears off a piece of plutos shirt and uses it as a bandage for his hand
he picks up his half broken shattered glasses on the floor and put them back
doug removes the bloody axe from the corpse
he turns to big brain who backs off the baby
the baby is in the last house on the left
the back door to the suv opens revealing bobby and brenda carrying lynns body inside where ethels body has been moved
not far from the car and above the fishing pole catherines shaker remains still and silent
still imprisoned in the car beast barks desperate to find a way out
a hundred yards away cyst crosses main street toward big brains house still holding the shotgun
through the broken door cyst spots pluto in a pool of blood
hatred fills his eyes as he loads the shotgun and prepares to shoot
he looks for doug but sees no one
cyst moves in between a few cars failing to see doug hiding behind one of them
doug hits the man in his knee with the axe
he severs half of his right leg
cyst screams in agony
in one swift move doug removes the axe from cysts kneecap swinging it into his back
cyst falls on the ground
the fall pushes the axe further into his back
cyst reaches for the shotgun lost in his fall
doug steps on his chest and pushes slowly crack the axe finally hits the spine killing him instantly
doug picks up the shotgun
from the broken window big brain watches doug walk away down main street
he picks up a walkie talkie hidden in his lizard
kill the baby
lizard enters the house holding a machete
the wound lynn had given him before she died still bleeds through his improvised bandage
he moves to the kitchen with a limp
there he comes face to face with ruby
behind her the baby is wrapped inside a blanket on the table
the kitchen walls are covered with dry blood
severed human remains are scattered about and hanging like slabs of meat
ruby blocks his way get out of the way ruby
ruby refuses to let him pass
lizard lifts the machete threatening his little sister
scared ruby obeys and runs out the kitchen door
lizard approaches the baby who moves inside the blanket
at the same time doug arrives at the last house on the street
he looks for his baby in every part of the house
nothing but dummies
doug enters a room and sees a crib
he goes to the crib and discovers a plastic doll
you want to play with us mister
doug turns around and sees two children playing in the shadows
they smile at him kindly doug backs away terrified
lizard is about to butcher the baby on the table
catherine is calm and moves slowly under the blanket
in a panic doug runs out of the last house screaming
lizard lifts the machete and removes the blanket ruby made the swap before lizard entered the kitchen
the piglet runs off oinking
enraged lizard sticks the machete into the table
outside with the baby in her arms ruby runs as fast as she can
desperate doug runs through the test town looking for his daughter
in an upstairs window he sees rubys mother the obese woman swinging on a rocking chair staring back
suddenly coming from the hills doug hears the sound of a baby crying
in the distance he spots ruby running through the rocks
he runs with the shotgun in hand
under the fake car in between the seats beast finds a hole big enough to fit his nose
the animal forces his way through scratching at the floor until he finally fits his body through the hole and out of the car
the dog runs down main street
back on the trailer
sweating bobby joins his sister hidden behind the sw
with the mm in hand staring at the horizon he is ready to face the enemy
above the fishing pole catherines shaker is still
gust of wind blow on the eerily silent plains
suddenly in a flash the fishing line tightens and the then quiet returns as if nothing had ever happened
brenda is terrified
maybe someone has crossed their zone of security
bobby lifts his head and looks a full a bobby and brenda exchange worried glances when the fishing reel quickly unwinds
this time there is little room for doubt even if all seems clear around the camper
bobby and brenda leave their hiding place
they move back to back cautious
answer me why isnt anyone there
stay close brenda
from inside the sw we see the two adolescents getting further away when
its papa jupiter
his long hair and thick beard cover everything except his determined and psychopathic eyes
bobby and brenda have arrived at the end of their security zone
further ahead on the ground a tumbleweed is stuck on the fishing wire moving it in the wind
lets go back
not convinced bobby agrees but his face freezes when he turns back to see the back door of the suv wide open
at a loss bobby and brenda return
what happened bobby
a trail of blood leads from the trailer to somewhere behind some rocks
hes over there
get the trailer ready
the new visitor has brought the nightmare back to life in brendas eyes
brenda remains still
terrorized brenda backs up to the trailer while her brother with a determined look on his face walks to the hills
brenda returns to the trailer where two propane tanks have been brought out from under the sink
through the window she watches her brother get further out
what bobby discovers behind the rocks is beyond horrific kneeling next to his mothers corpse papa jupiter devours her heart tearing into it with his teeth
feeling bobbys bobby points his gun at him
papa jupiter stands and in a fit of rage charges at bobby
keeping his cool bobby fires bang
the bullets only slow him down
the gun is empty
brenda opens the valves to the gas tanks
outside bobby throws the gun and runs to the trailer as fast as he can
papa jupiter is right behind him
he takes a small pickaxe from his belt and throws it at bobby
bobby enters the trailer closing the door behind him
he quickly tapes matches at the bottom of the door right above the striking part of the matchbox on the floor
next to him the propane flows freely
behind the trailer brenda helps her brother squeeze out of the back window
they both run and hide behind a rock
at the same time papa jupiter stands in front of the trailer door relishing the idea that his victims are inside
he opens the door
the matches strike protected by the rocks bobby and brenda watch as the explosion climbs to the sky
they did it
with catherine held tightly in her arms ruby runs on the edge of the mountain
seventy yards behind lizard gives chase with a limp and the chain of spikes in tow
you come back here right now
you hear me you little bitch
the road on the edge comes to a dead end
ruby is stuck the only way out is to climb
without using her hands she attempts to ascend
its close to impossible
she tries to fight him off but he is too strong
ruby kicks him in the jaw enraging him more
he pulls her down swiftly when the animal shows his teeth advancing towards lizard who backs off
lizard is amused and almost excited with this last confrontation
discreetly he grabs the chain of spikes while keeping his eyes on the barking german shepherd
beast sees the weapon and leaps towards lizard
the chain strikes the dog in the air sending him over the edge
ruby refuses to hand over the baby holding it tightly to her chest
give me that baby ruby
with no time to react lizard is brutally struck in the face with the shotgun butt taking no chances and screaming like a wild beast doug beats lizard repeatedly pushing
him away from the baby
with a bloodied face lizard can hardly stand
doug turns the weapon around and bang
he shoots lizard in the chest
lizard is thrown back with the force
doug reloads still screaming bang
lizard is hit in the throat and falls
to his knees
blood sprays everywhere
doug reloads again bang
hit in the shoulder lizard falls back in the dirt
his face slams into the dust
exhausted doug walks over to his adversary
he is dead
disfigured with wounds doug turns to ruby who extends the baby
doug can barely comprehend it the nightmare is finally over
drops the smoking gun and opens his arms to embrace his baby
he cries tears of joy as he holds catherine close to him
my little princess
its me its daddy
he kisses the baby and hugs her tightly elated
ruby is moved
she smiles when suddenly her face freezes trembling he lifts the weapon towards doug and the baby
instinctively ruby moves to stop him
his finger squeezes the trigger
at the last second ruby jumps on lizard changing the direction of the blast
they both fall off the mountain into the emptiness
their bodies plunge a hundred feet down splattering on the rocks below
one of the family photos of the carters posing with their dogs is slowly burning away in the flames
pieces of the trailer still burn in the middle of the desert
surrounded by debris papa jupiters body is impaled
on a darkened metal siding
still alive but entirely burnt his skin is raw and unrecognizable
with every breath blood spits from his mouth
facing this post atomic creature bobby hesitates to take it out of its misery
brenda comes to his side
come on bobby
lets get out of here
bobbys face has changed
he is no longer the innocent kid of just a few hours ago
his eyes are now filled with rage and a determination to survive and succeed no matter what
brenda and bobby walk away from the burning trailer
on the other side of the smoke they see exhausted wounded disfigured but still alive
from a distance next to the fiery trailer we see doug brenda and bobby gathered around the baby
