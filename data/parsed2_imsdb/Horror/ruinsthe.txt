written by scott smith the hotel is six stories high a wall of glass and stucco
beach chairs are arrayed around the pools edge sunbathers lie sprawled across them
a short boardwalk leads toward the gulf of mexico the white sand the blue water
four young americans are encamped near the pools edge theyre all in their early twenties
amy lies face down on a chaise eyes shut a cooler beside her
shes petite with short blond hair her skin pinkly sunburned
eric sits in the chair beside her studying the cliff notes for the canterbury tales
hes leanly muscular with dark curly hair
other cliff notes lie scattered beneath his chair antigone a separate peace hea rt of darkness
jeff and stacy sit on the far side of the cooler theyre playing gin
stacy too is petite with short hair though hers
shes wearing a pale blue bikini and has a beer bottle in her hand
she looks a little bored
jeff is tall scrawny
like eric he has a pair of swim trunks on and is deeply tanned
hes very focused frowning down at his cards
we should play war
its more fun
jeff takes a card from his hand lays it down on the table
thats not even a game
sure it is
ill teach you
she starts to fold her hand but jeff shakes his head
i know how to play
i mean its just chance theres no skill involved
stacy frowns down at her hand silenced
she picks a card from the deck immediately discards it
jeff snatches it up lays down one of his own
stacy stares at it in dismay
but i keep losing
cause youre not concentrating
i wouldnt have to concentrate if we played war
so wheres the fun
id win sometimes
its not fun if we both cant win
but its not winning if its just chance
of course it is
if we flipped a coin and i called heads and it fuck
eric throws the canterbury tales to the ground
then he rises steps to the cooler pulls out a beer carries it back to his chair
stacy watches as he takes a long swallow
maybe you should just be honest sweetie
eric doesnt even glance at her
he sips his beer again
stacy contd you could say look i dont know anything about these either so now were gonna read them together and sort of teach each other as we go
turning to jeff wouldnt you have loved that
to have a teacher who amy speaks without opening her eyes cutting stacy off why would they hire you if you havent read the books
i said i had
so maybe you should
appalled by the idea the canterbury tales
you ever look at that shit
ive read it
its not even english
jeff watches stacy take another card she examines it sets it on the discard pile
then reciting this world nys but a thurghfare ful of wo and we been pilgrymes passing to and fro
deeth is an ende of every worldly soore
eric and stacy stare at jeff in astonishment
amy doesnt react
jeff glances toward her
jeff contd sunscreen amy
ive got a base
i can see it
she finally opens her eyes lifts her head peers at her shoulders
she presses at the pink skin
im just flushed
its too hot
stacy leans forward picks a second card off the deck
jeff is focused on amy he doesnt notice
youre hot because youre burning
its only been stacy interrupts speaking in a slightly singsong fashion
so there was this king who lived in a castle
amy turns gives her a pained look
but what he really wanted was a beach house
both of you
they ignore her ping ponging quickly back and forth so he decided to move
but the queen didnt want to
so he left by himself
but he got lonely
amy covers her ears with her hands blocking out their voices but then inmiediately reaches to feel for her earrings one of them is missing
so he bought a dog
but it had fleas
i lost my earring
so he gave it a bath
but the dog caught
amy sits up glancing about
stacy and eric keep going
so he gave it some medicine
but it was the wrong kind
so the dog died
amy rises steps toward the pool
jeff lays down his cards joins her beside the water
they both peer into it
a young man is approaching down the boardwalk from the beach carrying fins a mask a snorkel
hes in his early twenties blond crew cut very tall
his name is mathias
as he nears the pool he stops staring
eric and stacy have risen to join jeff and amy theyre all peering into the water
amy holds her remaining earring out to eric and stacy showing them what it looks like
he stands there hesitating
then he starts forward
we glide just above the pools pale blue bottom
a silver earring comes into view
mathiass hand reaches for it
the two couples have spread out around the pools edge searching for the earring
mathias surfaces in front of amy
he holds out his hand with the earring in it she stares startled then crouches to take it
thank you so much
he starts to turn as if to swim off but jeff stops him
want a beer
he waves toward their chairs the cooler beside them
mathias and the two couples sit together with their beers
amys skin has turned deep red stacy is behind her applying lotion to her shoulders
eric is talking to mathias we went sailing yesterday
out toward cozumel
and there were these seven foot fish these huge nurse sharks
he nods like thirty of them
a whole you know flock
the water was i dont know ten feet deep
and they were lying on the bottom just waiting for somebody to come swimming by theyre not dangerous
eric turns stares at jeff
you said theyre sharks
but theyre not dangerous
they eat lobsters
that sort of thing
eric considers this frowning
then he takes a sip of beer
he shrugs turns back toward mathias
i wouldnt be snorkeling on my own
thats all im saying
when mathias speaks its with a slight german accent i wasnt on my own
i was with my brother
jeff glances around the pool
mathias shakes his head
he met a girl
they went away
its a complicated story
they watch him waiting for more but nothing comes
finally you should hang with us then
if youre on your own
he glances at the others right
everyone nods smiling
eric reaches into the cooler pulls out another beer holds it toward mathias
theres a dj a dozen beer kegs
a few young men and women are dancing beside a bonfire but most of the crowd is scattered in small groups across the sand talking drinking the firelight flickering off
stacy amy eric jeff and mathias are sitting together they all have cups of beer
stacy is between erics legs leaning against his chest
amy jeff and mathias sit cross legged
everyone but jeff and mathias is a little drunk and you can hear it in their voices
amy drains her cup stands up very unsteadily
she holds out her hand to jeff
eric smiles as if the idea of jeff dancing were absurd
jeff doesnt dance amy he has no rhythm
of all his many gifts rhythm is not one
thats not true
he played the trombone in high school
he won a prize
eric seems startled by this amused
she drains her beer tosses the cup aside
jeffs won prizes for everything
his mom has a whole room built just for them
trophies and ribbons and plaques
hes a very accomplished young man
she holds out her hand to you
he shakes his head i dont dance on sand
stacy makes a snorting sound
i dance on teak
its a type of wood
find me a teak floor and ill be a dancing fool
amy shifts toward mathias holds out her hand
he stares at it then glances at jeff
before he can speak stacy pushes herself to her feet shes almost as wobbly as amy
they lurch off across the sand toward the bonfire
the boys watch them go
a beat then jeff glances at his watch
im gonna head back
eric gives him a look of disappointment youre kidding
jeff seems startled by this what
how long is med school
eric contd and then you got whaddya call it residency
eric turns toward mathias
eric contd hes gonna be grinding away all that time
and know what
hes gonna look back on this night us right here and hes gonna say to himself shit i wish id gone to bed earlier
eric stares at him this wasnt the direction he was heading
jeff contd if im gonna be so short on sleep i should get as
much as i can now dont you think
he stands up brushes the sand from his shorts
eric shrugs lifts his cup toward him
all work and no play
makes a man healthy wealthy and wise
with that jeff nods good night to them then starts off toward the hotel
eric and mathias turn back toward the bonfire
they sit in silence watching the girls dance
after a moment amy staggers away from the other dancers toward a group of young men drinking together in the shadows
she reaches down pulls one of them to his feet starts to drag him back toward the bonfire
the young man is tall with long blond hair
he laughs tries to free himself but amy is insistent she keeps pulling at him and finally he surrenders
they begin to dance
stacy is dancing on her own eyes shut oblivious
mathias glances toward eric
amy drifts sometimes when she drinks
like a boat she bumps into other boats
they continue to watch
amy and her partners dancing is becoming steadily more intimate the gap between their bodies narrowing then disappearing altogether
finally eric pushes himself to his feet
eric contd come on
lets save everyone some grief
forward followed by mathias
they join stacy and amy and eric subtly interrupts amys pas de deux
the blond haired young man disengages drifts back toward his friends
its quiet the sun just breaking the horizon the beach is nearly empty
a handful of hotel employees are tidying up after the bonfire carrying off the empty kegs raking clean the rubbish strewn sand
gulls hover overhead cawing
jeff appears running along the beach his t shirt soaked with sweat
he stops as he nears us stands for a moment just above the line of surf catching his breath watching the sun rise
then he turns starts toward the hotel
a breakfast buffet trays of pancakes eggs fresh fruit
there are a dozen tables beneath brightly colored umbrellas
mathias is the only diner at this hour hes dressed in jeans and a t shirt
he studies a piece of paper as he eats
youre up early
mathias lifts his head jeff is standing there in his sweaty shirt smiling down at him
i have to catch a bus
mathias slides the sheet of paper toward him
jeff bends to look
theres a paragraph in german scrawled above a hand drawn map with four place names cancun valladolid tizimin coba
a large x has been drawn to the west of coba
the girl my brother met was on her way to this place to work
he waves at the map its a dig an archaeological dig
and he went with her
he left the map saying i could come too if i got bored on my own
a beat he watches jeff examine the map
then mathias contd our flight leaves the day after tomorrow
i can wait and hope he returns in time
or i can go get him
its a question of trusting him to do the right thing
and you dont
henrich doesnt think things through
he runs at them
he searches shakes his theres a word in english but i cant remember it
he nods so i have to be responsible
all our lives the same story
slides the map back toward him
one of those pyramids
he shakes his head an old mining camp
mathias just stares at him
jeff contd you dont speak spanish
mathias shakes his head
jeff contd so how will you find this place
he smiles shrugs follow the m ap
jeff frowns down at the map for a long beat
it seems as if hes going to question the feasibility of this but
then he disengages instead wiping at the sweat on his face
well good luck
mathias nods his thanks and jeff turns starts away from the table
we move with him across the terrace into the its completely empty at this hour and eerily silent
chairs are stacked on the tables
as jeff enters a waiter moves past ham carrying a pitcher of orange juice
jeff stops turns to watch through the window beside the door
the waiter refills mathiass glass
mathias smiles nods
jeff hesitates wavering
then he pushes open the door again steps outside
we watch as he approaches mathias
theres the sound of someone retching coughing
this carries over into a rack with towels on it a sink a tub
amy is crouched over the toilet in underwear and a t shirt vomiting
her skin is bright red
jeff is standing in the tub freshly showered drying himself watching
his running clothes hang from a hook beside the door
amy doesnt answer
she coughs spits
jeff contd you dont have to come you know
you dont look fine
thats very helpful
she pushes herself to her feet flushes the toilet steps to the sink squeezes some toothpaste onto a toothbrush
well be back by nightfall
you can just amy is raising the brush to her mouth but she stops gives jeff a look in the mirror
you dont want me to come
thats not what im saying
so whatre you saying
youre hungover under slept im not sunburned
jeff stares at her the deep red of her face
then he shrugs steps out of the tub the towel around his waist
amy bends over the sink starts to brush her teeth
a king sized bed a bureau two night tables a mini fridge
jeff emerges from the bathroom steps toward the bureau starts to dress boxers jeans t shirt
a beat then amy shuffles out of the bathroom
she sits on the edge of the bed starts to pull on a pair of shorts
amy stops the shorts around her ankles
ill get too sweaty
jeff pulls a pair of khakis from the bureau tosses them onto the bed beside her
theres gonna be mosquitoes
he picks up a knapsack steps to the mini fridge opens its door
amy stares down at the khakis for a beat then drops back onto the bed
she lies there looking up at the ceiling her shorts still caught around her ankles
we dont even know this guy
jeff slides two bottles of iced tea into the knapsack
theres a plastic shopping bag beside the fridge and he starts to dig through it
i just dont see why we have to go with him
if you and i were traveling together somewhere you didnt speak the language and id vanished somehow wouldnt you want someone to help find me
why would you vanish
jeff turns looks at her this isnt the point
arent you getting bored
the beach the pool the beach the pool
thisll be fun
jeff pulls two protein bars from the bag a box of raisins a plastic bag full of grapes he drops them into the knapsack
jeff contd you said you wanted to go hiking didnt you
see the ruins
amy is silent unmoving clearly not swayed
jeff contd stay here then
theres no why do you keep saying that
its like youd rather i didnt a knocking at the door and she falls silent
jeff rises zipping shut the knapsack
he steps to the door opens it
stacy and eric are in the hall
the both answer at the same time amys having second thoughts
jeff doesnt want me to go
stacy and eric are silent neither wants to get involved in this
a beat then jeff sighs glances at his watch
now or never any
were gonna miss the bus
amy gives a loud groan sits up reaches for her khakis
only half the seats are occupied tourists with their packs and cameras and hats
little tvs hang from the ceiling
we move slowly down the aisle passing jeff and amy first
amy is sound asleep a camera hanging from her neck a panama hat in her lap
jeff is beside her bent low over a tour book comparing its much more detailed map with the one mathiass brother left behind
next come eric and stacy hunched together in their seats watching a mexican soap opera on the little tv above them
stacy mimics the actors exaggerated gestures giggling
eric has the cliff notes for hamlet in his lap unopened
finally theres mathias
the seat beside him is empty
hes staring out the window his expression perfectly blank
the town is very small a dirt road lined with one and two story buildings some with thatched roofs
theres a gravel turnaround with a bus idling in it
its door creaks open
a dozen tourists emerge from the bus blinking in the sunlight
jeff amy stacy eric and mathias are among them
the boys have the knapsacks the girls are wearing matching hats
amy rubs at her face stretching waking up
theres a souvenir stand at the towns entrance with brightly colored blankets hanging from its walls
the tourists start toward it leaving jeff and the others beside
the idling bus
they peer about getting their bearings
mathias has his brothers note
he holds it out pointing and they gather around him to look
we take a cab
we see the map theres a line drawn from cancun to coba where another shorter line moves westward
mathiass finger moves along this shorter line toward the x on the map
how many miles is that
they all glance at jeff
a little more
then therell be a path
which we hike four kilometers
the others look to jeff again
he slings his pack
two and a half miles
the tourists are vanishing into the town
the buss door squeaks shut
i dont see any cabs
the bus eases into motion crunching across the gravel pulling out onto the road
behind it a yellow pickup truck is revealed
taxi is hand painted in black on its side
they start toward the truck
its driver is mayan short and heavy set with thick glasses
his eyes are shut hes dozing behind the wheel
the trucks engine
is running the windows shut tight against the heat
jeff taps the window and theres a burst of movement from the trucks rear as a dog springs up barking and growling
they all leap back the girls shrieking
the dog is a mutt small but muscular
hes attached to a cinder block by a short chain which he throws himself against slobbering snapping at the air
they all stare at the dog the girls laugh nervously clutching each other
the driver has roused himself he leans forward rolls down his window stares out at them
the man gives him a somber nod the dog keeps barking
jeff takes the map from mathias then steps warily forward
jeff contd habla ingles usted
the man half nods half shrugs
jeff contd how much to drive us to here
he offers the map to the driver who reaches to take it
the man frowns at it
then in heavily accented english why you go this place
jeff struggles for a simple way to explain their mission
in the back of the truck the dog continues its frantic barring
there are these ruins
this old mining camp
jeff contd he points toward mathias and his brother fifteen dollar i take you ruins
jeff points at the map
the driver shakes his head
this place no good
he holds the map back out toward jeff
jeff takes it gives the man a puzzled look
no good you go
fifteen dollar i take you good place
you like i promise
jeff glances toward the others as if for help
they all just stand there watching
the dog wont stop barring
driver contd i take you pyramid
he smiles at jeff his teeth are large and thick looking
and black along the gums
jeff pulls out his wallet
he removes a ten and a five then points at the map
how about we pay you fifteen dollars to go here
he holds the money out
the man doesnt even look at it
i tell you no good
still you go
his smile has disappeared he seems angry suddenly as if jeff has somehow insulted him
jeff hesitates glancing toward the others again
then in a conciliatory tone were looking for his brother
he points toward mathias su hermano
the driver wrenches the door open making jeff and the others flinch
he climbs out still with that angry expression on his face then leans into the back of the truck grabs the dogs chain unhooks it from the cinder block
he lifts the dog from the truck by the chain
even dangling by its neck the mutt continues to snarl and snap at jeff and the others
they back away and the man tosses the dog into the trucks cab pushing the door shut
the dog throws its body against the window slobbering and barking
the man turns toward jeff wiping his hands on his pants
jeff tries again jeff contd im sure your ruins are better than these
its just that we the driver cuts him off holding out his hand with that same air of enraged disgust
jeff gives him the money
then the driver slaps the side of the truck gestures for them to climb into the back
below us the yellow truck travels along a single lane road
jeff and the others are in its rear
there are fields on either side of the road bordered by thick jungle
the truck reaches a fork in the road bears left angling toward the wall of jungle into which it vanishes the overhanging foliage blocking it from sight
the road is dirt heavily rutted
theres a small clearing beside it with a path opening off it
the trees grow over the path forming a shady tunnel
we hear birds calling a steady throb of insect life but otherwise all is silent
a beat then theres the sound of the truck approaching along with the dogs barking and growling
the pickup appears moving slowly bouncing and swaying across the ruts
the truck pulls into the little clearing stops
jeff and the others clamber out over its tailgate
the dog is still lunging at them from behind the trucks rear window
jeff gives the driver a wave
the driver doesnt even look at him he just pulls out onto the road heading back in the direction from which they came
there are mosquitoes stacy starts to slap at herself
jeff unslings his pack pulls out a can of insect repellent
jeff contd here
he begins to spray her then eric
amy is peering off after the truck
they can still hear the dogs barking but very faintly now
jeff finishes with eric starts in on mathias
how do we get back
she points back down the road toward the vanished truck
jeff pauses in his spraying considers for a moment
then the guidebook said you can always flag down a passing bus
so i there arent going to be any buses on that road
jeff nods this seems obvious
he resumes spraying mathias
eric and stacy stand there watching
amy contd a bus couldnt even fit
it also said you can hitch see any cars pass jeff
jeff doesnt answer
he steps toward her starts to spray her too
she holds out her arms
amy contd the whole time we were driving you see even one
eric has his phone
cant we just call someone
hes not gonna get a signal
not way out here
they all turn to watch as eric reaches into
his pack pulls out his cell phone flips it open
he stares at it for a beat then shakes his head snaps it shut
jeff finishes spraying amy starts in on himself
they must have a way to get supplies in
they must have a truck
or access to a truck
when we find mathiass brother we can just ask them to take us all back to coba
turning to mathias right
mathias seems startled by the question
i mean i he shrugs he has no idea
amy is still focused on jeff were stranded arent we
thats like a twenty mile walk were gonna have to do
through the jungle
jeff finishes with the insect repellent crouches to slide the can back into his pack
its eleven miles
theres no way that was eleven miles
jeff rises slings his pack
he gives amy a tired look
lets just find this place okay
then we can figure out how to get back
amy is silent
jeff turns to the others
jeff contd ready
mathias and eric nod and the boys start down the path
amy stands there watching them go
stacy steps toward her
just go with it honey
youll see itll all work out
she hooks arms with her pulls her into motion
they hike in single file first jeff then eric mathias stacy and amy
the path is six feet wide hard packed dirt
all around and above is the jungle big leafed plants vines and creepers immense trees
the path moves in snakelike curves we cant see very far in either direction
theyre all sweating their shirts clinging to their bodies
the bugs continue to harass them
so there was this girl who bought a piano
amy gives a loud moan
but she didnt know how to play
so she signed up for lessons
but she couldnt afford them
stacy reaches taps mathiass shoulder
you can play too
if you want
mathias glances back at her
stacy contd its easy
someone says so then you say but
its like catch only without a ball
to eric so she got a job in a factory
but was fired for being late
amy takes off her hat wipes the sweat from her face
so she became a prostitute
its tedious and boring
and once they start its impossible to get them to stop
but she fell in love with her first client
amy puts her hat back on
she looks hot sweaty tired
how much farther
mathias peers down at his brothers note
stacy and eric continue with their game
we cross a stream
then so she asked him to marry therell be a path branching her
off to our left
if we see a village weve gone too far
amy contd eric a village
but he was already married
a mayan village
so she begged him to get a divorce
amy contd eric will they have air but he was in love with his conditioning
mathias shrugs returns the note to his pocket
it just says theres a so she decided to kill her
amy contd i think we should go see it
i think we should jeff stops suddenly pointing
thirty feet in front of them the trail dips toward a small stream studded with boulders
it resumes on the far bank rising gradually uphill in a long straightaway
the stream is slow moving the water dark brown
eric sniffs the air
they must use it as a latrine
they start toward it gingerly the girls covering their noses
jeff crosses the stream hopping from boulder to boulder and the others follow
stacy almost falls in she only catches her balance at the final instant yelping
jeff is already starting up the trail searching for the turnoff
theres no sign of it the dense foliage extends unbroken as far as the eye can see
he turns to mathias
jeff contd how far past the stream
right after it says
they stand there in a loose group staring at the trees
eric pulls a bottle of water from his pack takes a swallow then passes it to stacy
amy lifts her arm points
up the trail sixty feet away stand two small mayan boys they seem to have materialized out of the air
theyre ten years old shirtless scrawny dark haired
one of them is holding a bicycle by its handlebars it doesnt have a seat
amy contd maybe they can guide us
stacy smiles toward the boys she waves calls out the boys just stand there staring at them silent their expressions wary even frightened
one of them leans to whisper something to the other who nods
why dont we he stops noticing mathias
the german is staring toward the edge of the trail where a large bush sits
one of its fronds is very slowly dropping toward them pulling itself free of the soil
mathias steps forward tugs at a second frond which slips easily from the dirt
he tosses it aside reaches for another frond this too slips free
someone has pushed them into the earth arranging them to look like a bush
mathias pulls a fourth frond free then a fifth and an opening is revealed in the brush a narrow path winding its way off through the trees
they stand there a beat staring at it
then theres a squeaking sound and they all turn
one of the boys is hurriedly pedaling off bent low over the bicycles handlebars
his companion remains behind staring toward us with a look of obvious anxiety
amy turns to jeff so do the others
why was it covered
jeff lifts his hands how should he know
maybe its not the right path
no one speaks
they keep staring from the boy to the newly revealed path trying to make sense of it
we can still hear the squeaking of the bicycle growing steadily fainter
its on the map
its a hand drawn map jeff
and it was hidden
why would it be hidden
jeff steps forward shields his eyes tries to peer into the dimness of the narrow path
then he glances back toward the little boy who continues to stand there watching them
maybe the archaeologists dont want people to find the mine
jeff has to think
finally maybe theyve dug up something valuable
emeralds or something
whatever they were mining in the first place
and they dont want anyone to come rob them
so theyve asked the mayans to help keep people away
he falls into silence staring at the boy
no one appears very convinced by his theory not even jeff
jeff contd how much farther is it
mathias takes the map from his pocket again glances at it
be silly to stop now dont you think
no one answers no one moves
this just feels weird jeff
jeff sighs fighting to suppress his impatience with her
so we what
walk all the way back to coba
they all turn to stare back down the trail then toward the mayan boy whos still watching them
stacy slaps a mosquito leaving a bloody smear on her bare arm
jeff lifts his hand gestures at the path
leading into the trees
jeff contd come on
were almost there
the others glance at one another waiting for someone to argue no one does
finally mathias steps forward slipping through the narrow opening
eric follows him and then with just the slightest hesitation so do amy and stacy
jeff throws one last glance toward the boy whos still standing there sixty feet away watching with his anxious expression and then he too vanishes into the trees
they make their way along the winding path one after another all of them sweating slapping at the mosquitoes
maybe the ruins are sacred
and they dont want people digging them up
he glances about off into the trees a little spooked
eric contd we could be walking through some sort of ancient graveyard right now
its a mine
an old mining camp
theres nothing sacred about it
eric considers this as they walk
the others are also quiet too hot to speak
the sunlight falls through the trees in thin shifting columns hazed with mosquitoes
maybe it leads to a marijuana field then
maybe the village is growing pot and that boy rode off to get them and theyre gonna come with guns and eric
shut up okay
eric falls silent
they follow the path as it curves first right then left moving gradually uphill all the while and suddenly theres sunlight in front of them bright and intense a clearing
they hesitate at its edge staring
the clearing is twenty yards wide and extends in either direction as far as the eye can see finally curving out of sight
its soil is a deep black flecked with white like frost rime
its completely free of vegetation
the path resumes on the far side of the clearing winding its way up asmall hill
the hill is rocky oddly treeless and covered with a vinelike growth a vivid green with hand shaped leaves and tiny red flowers
jeff and the others step warily out onto the cleared ground peering about squinting in the sudden sunlight
they stare up at the flower covered hill
there are hints of ruins among the thick foliage giant boulders with faint carvings etched onto their surfaces the crumbling remains of a fallen pillar everything half buried beneath the
and the mosquitoes are gone
you realize that
theyve stopped biting
she smiles at the others delighted by this development
amy removes the cap from her camera starts to take pictures
we hear a click as she takes each photo and the image freezes for an instant
theres the hillside covered in its vine its red flowers click
theres eric pulling the water bottle from his pack click
theres stacy smiling at us waving click
theres mathias shading his eyes peering up the hill
is that a tent
amy lowers her camera turns to look
an orange square of fabric is just visible at the very top of the hill billowing sail like in the breeze
from this distance with the rise of the hill partly blocking the view its hard to tell what it is
they all stand there peering up the hill
faintly but growing steadily louder a thudding noise comes from the jungle
the five of them turn heads cocked listening
its true hoofbeats are approaching at a gallop
instinctively jeff and the others back a handful of steps toward the hill
beat then a horseman bursts into the clearing rearing to a halt
amy lifts her camera
a bald mayan man is on the horse hes broad shouldered short in his early forties dressed in a white shirt and pants
the horse rears a second time and the image freezes for an instant with a click as amy snaps another picture
the bald man shouts at them in unsubtitled mayan
his horse is lathered snorting rolling its eyes
it rears yet again and the man half falls half jumps to the ground
jeff and the others back a few more steps into the clearing
the bald man is still holding the reins the horse is backing away from him jerking its head trying to break free pulling him step by step back toward the
the man cant gain control of the horse
finally he drops the reins and the horse gallops into the jungle crashing through the trees its hoofbeats gradually diminishing
the man turns toward them starts yelling in mayan again pointing back down the trail
sweat shines on his forehead
theres a gun on his belt a black pistol in a brown holster
stacy is clutching erics arm looking frightened
whats he saying
maybe he wants money
a toll or something
the mayan continues shouting waving his arm
jeff reaches into his pocket pulls out his wallet removes a twenty
the man ignores the proffered bill makes a shooing motion waving them from the clearing
mathias turns toward the hill cups his hands around his mouth shouts theres no response just the orange fabric gently billowing
why dont you hike up see if you can find him
well try to sort this out
mathias nods starts across the clearing
the bald man shouts at him in mayan and then when mathias doesnt stop pulls his pistol from its holster fires into the sky
everyone flinches half ducking
mathias goes still
the man waves at him yelling in mayan and mathias comes back his hands raised to join the others
hoofbeats are approaching from the jungle again
they come closer and closer and suddenly two more horsemen burst into the clearing
theyre younger than the bald mans in their twenties dark haired muscular
one has a mustache
their mounts are white eyed snorting rearing just like the bald mans
the two men jump to the ground dropping their reins and the horses immediately turn and gallop back into the jungle
amy lifts her camera again
the young men have bows slung across their chest and quivers of thin fragile looking arrows
they question the bald man in mayan very rapidly
hes still aiming his pistol at mathias
a click and the image freezes for an instant
as they continue to interrogate the bald man in mayan the young men unsling their bows each of them nocking an arrow
reflexively jeff and the others retreat another handful of steps into the clearing
mathias still has his hands raised
what the fuck
wait and see
amy is a bit farther into the clearing than jeff and the others
she keeps swinging her camera from them to the mayans trying to capture the whole scene in one shot
shes too close though and she retreats another handful of steps
still backing up toward the hill all of them but stacy and eric are in the frame now
the bald mayan is still answering the young mens questions
he turns toward us suddenly points his pistol directly at us
starts to shout
jeff and the others turn too staring at amy in surprise
shes nearly at the far edge of the clearing peering through her camera she retreats another step
the young mayans raise their bows drawing them the bald man keeps yelling
she takes another step shes right up against the vines
stacy is in the frame now
we retreat one more step and so is eric and the mayans with their raised weapons the bald man still shouting everything freezes on the click
amy lowers her camera
the mayan with the mustache turns to the other two points toward her feet spearing urgently
the bald mayan slowly lowers his pistol looking dismayed
amy glances down
shes stepped out of the clearing into the flowering vine
both of the younger mayans are speaking now their voices rising
the bald mayan is shaking his head protesting but they talk right over him
amy steps clear of the vine starts back toward jeff and the younger mayans draw their bows taut again aiming at her chest
jeff lifts his hand without looking his eyes on the mayans
the bald man continues to frown and shake his head
he points to amy then the others he waves toward the jungle
but the young men are implacable they keep arguing gesturing and finally the bald man gives in falls silent
a beat then the bald man raises his pistol aims it at jeffs chest
he makes a shooing motion with his other hand but now its toward amy and the hill beyond her
he begins to shout the other men do too
then the bald man fires a bullet into the dirt at jeffs feet
everyone jumps starts to retreat
the men with the bows are swinging them back and forth herding them toward the hill
when jeff and the others reach amy the bald man points toward the trail waves them up it
he watches his expression looking stricken close to tears as the five of them obediently begin to climb the vine covered hill
midway up the hill they pause to catch their breath
check your phone eric
eric pulls out his phone flips it open stares at it
he snaps it shut
they stand there sweating scared looking
mathias cups his hands to his mouth again shouts henrich
i they all peer up the hill waiting for a response
it is a tent bright orange looking a bit worse for wear
the vine is growing up its aluminum poles as if on a trellis
the tent faces away from us its doorway is hidden
theres no sign or sound of any people
eric turns glances back down the hill shielding his eyes
theres another one
he points toward the clearing below them
a fourth man has arrived on a bicycle
hes dressed in white like the others with a straw hat on his head
a beat then two more mayans appear also on bicycles
they all have bows slung over their shoulders
the bald man addresses these newcomers
he waves in either direction and the other men start off along the clearing two one way three the other leaving him alone at the base of the hill
a beat then a little boy appears from the jungle the one whod watched them discover the camouflaged path
he and the bald man stand there peering up at us
eric turns to the others excited lets run back down
while theres just him and the kid
we can rush them
hes got a gun eric
this silences eric silences all of them
mathias turns shouts toward the tent again
theres no answer
they wait another beat then jeff waves them back into motion
the hill is flat on top forming a wide plateau
beyond the orange tent is a small clearing of rocky ground
a blue tent sits on the far side of the clearing looking just as weathered as the orange one the vine growing up its poles
the five of them pause peering about
jeff calls out hello
the vine covers everything but the trail and the clearing
we glimpse more rubble beneath its greenery time worn stelae a low stone wall
in some places the vine folds back upon itself forming waist high mounds tangled knoll like profusions of green
and everywhere hanging off it are those bright red flowers
mathias moves toward the orange tent and jeff follows him
they unzip its flap stoop to peer inside
the vine has taken root in here too growing on some things leaving others untouched
there are three sleeping bags unrolled on the floor
an oil lamp
a roll of duct tape
a bottle of tequila
a metal canteen
jeff and mathias zip the flap back shut
eric stacy and amy are fifteen feet away watching
some camping supplies
mathias starts across the clearing toward the blue tent followed by jeff and the others
he unzips its flap sticks his head inside
jeff leans to look too
the same thing sleeping bags backpacks camping supplies
the vine is growing on some things but not on
ten yards beyond the tent theres a hole cut into the dirt
stacy amy and eric have gathered at its edge jeff and mathias join them
the hole is rectangular ten feet by six feet and very deep we cant see its bottom
a windlass has been constructed beside the hole a horizontal barrel with a hand crank welded to its base
rope is coiled around the barrel
from there it passes over a small wheel which hangs from a sawhorse straddling the holes mouth
then it drops straight into the earth
a draft is rising from the hole and it lifts off amys hat
she tries to catch it but fumbles the hat falls away from her
they all watch it vanish into the dark
eric pulls out his phone flips it open almost absentmindedly a nervous gesture
theres still no signal
he closes it turns to survey the clearing the empty tents
jeff shrugs waves past the shaft
the clearing ends just a few yards from them
then the vines resume and in the midst of the vines is the path
it winds its way to the edge of the hilltop vanishes over it
keep going i guess
saying this he slings his pack onto his shoulder
then he starts forward the others falling in behind him
they pick their way down the trail
its much steeper on this side there are short stretches where they have to drop onto their rear ends and slide one after another
its after one of these that jeff suddenly stops staring
it looks as if the jungle has been chopped down all the way around the base of the hill isolating it in a ring of barren soil
one of the mayans has made his way along this cleared ground to the base of the trail
hes staring up at them
the man slides his bow off his shoulder nocks an arrow
he shakes his head at them calls out in mayan waves them away
the five of them stand there staring down at the man
what do we do
jeff shrugs starts forward again
the others hesitate and then one after another resume their downward march
as they approach the clearing the mayan man yells what sounds like someones name
a beat then another bowman comes jogging into view
jeff and the others stop at the bottom of the trail
they stand there staring
the vine has invaded the clearing here
ten feet in front of the path is one of those odd knoll like growths knee high thick with flowers
the two mayans are another twenty feet beyond it in the center of the clearing bows drawn
her skin is slick with sweat and shes winded from the hike down
a third mayan comes jogging toward them
he stops beside the other two draws his bow
we should rush them
all at once
shut up eric
or go make shields
if we had some shields we could he falls silent as another mayan comes running toward them
along the clearing
this one is bearded heavier than the others
and hes carrying a rifle
oh my god
jeff is staring at the little isolated island of vines ten feet in front of them peering intently at it
lets go back up
jeff takes a step forward into the clearing slowly warily
stacy contd i wanna go back
jeff takes another step edging toward the mound his eyes on the mayans their raised weapons
they just watch him
he ignores her takes a third step then a forth which brings him to the mound of vines
he crouches reaches into the tendrils parting them
he grasps a stalk tugs pulls it free
we see a tennis shoe a sock a mans shin
jeff turns stares at mathias who steps forward crouches beside him starts to pull at the vines gently at first then more aggressively tearing them the plants sap shining on
his skin a low moan rising from his chest
another shoe is revealed another leg a pair of jeans a belt buckle a black t shirt
and then finally a young mans face the flesh oddly eaten away so that his cheekbone is visible the white socket of his left eye
amy contd oh no
jeff holds up his hand silencing her
the mayans stand there in the center of the clearing watching
mathias has begun to rock slightly that moaning coming and going
jeff touches his shoulder whispers easy
easy and slow
well stand up and well walk away
well walk back up the hill
the young mans t shirt is stiff with dried blood
three slender arrows impaled in his chest
its my brother
they killed him
jeff nods his hand still on mathiass
shoulder he squeezes
up the hill okay
mathias is struggling to control his breathing the moans keep coming
finally he manages a nod and they both stand up
stacy and amy are holding hands looking stricken
stacy has started to cry
eric has his arm around her
the mayans keep their weapons raised
they watch in silence as jeff and the others turn to start back up the hill
jeff and mathias are at the top of the trail staring down toward the clearing
more mayans are appearing from the jungle
theyre all armed
the bald man sends them out along the clearing some in one direction some the other
jeff and mathias stand there grim faced watching
mathias lifts his hands stares at them
theyve turned a deep raw meat red as if scarred
he flexes his fingers wincing
amy stacy and eric sit in the clearing beside the shaft passing a bottle of water among themselves
eric is struggling to calm the girls we can sneak past once the sun
sets i bet
just reep by them in the dark
stacy and amy hardly seem to hear him they look dazed distraught
eric passes the bottle to stacy
a beat then eric contd and then theres the girl
the one his brother met
what happened to her
amy and stacy are silent
stacy lifts the water bottle to her lips but immediately lowers it and starts to cry again
amy takes her hand
eric watches them silent
then eric contd and the archaeologists
you think stacys crying deepens toward a sob
amy gives eric a look
stop it eric
just stop okay
stacy struggles to collect herself breathing deep
she wipes at her face
amy keeps stroking her hand
jeff and mathias are approaching across the hilltop
mathias holding his burned looking hands out in front of him
he a nd jeff crouch beside the others
jeff takes the bottle from stacy
he pours a tiny bit of water on mathiass hands
theres something in the plants
the sap it burned his skin
mathias rubs at his hands with his shirt grimacing
amy reaches to take the water back from jeff
she starts to lift the bottle to her mouth but
teff leans forward grabs it
jeff contd dont
we need to save it
but im thirsty
we all are
so lets drink
jeff shakes his head capping the bottle
we dont have that much
we need to ration it
he glances up at the sky well have to figure out a way to catch the rain
everyone but amy peers up at the sky its a perfect cloudless blue
amy remains focused on jeff
i lost my hat
i need some water
why do you get to decide
jeff stares at her considering this
then he shrugs
he glances at the others but first you should understand that each of us is gonna need half a gallon of water a day at a minimum to survive here
thats two and a half gallons total every day
and right now until it rains we dont have it
not even one days worth
a beat now who wants to give amy more water
a long moment of silence
no one can meet amys eyes
finally very quietly maybe we should just wait honey
everyone looks toward jeff
another hour or so
then well all have a sip
amy can see that she has no choice
she gives a grudging nod and jeff slides the bottle into his knapsack
jeff contd we have to get organized
while were still fresh
well have to stay out of the sun spend as much time as possible in the tents
well have to cant we sneak away when it gets dark
eric said we
jeff shakes his head cutting her off
he waves across the hilltop toward where he and mathias had been standing
they keep coming
more and more of them
theyre all armed and the bald one sends them out along the clearing
theyre surrounding us
amy stacy and eric struggle to absorb this
finally why dont they just kill us
its got something to do with the hill i think
once you step on it youre not allowed off
something like that
they wont step on it themselves but now that were here they wont let us leave
so we have to figure out a way to survive till someone comes and finds us
jeff lifts one hand palm up half a shrug
peoplell start to worry when we dont return home
and were not supposed to leave till friday
amy contd and theyll have to come searching
again he nods
amy contd so youre talking what a week
something like that
amy looks appalled her voice jumps
we cant live here for a week jeff
if we try to leave theyll shoot us
thats the one thing we know for certain
an electronic chirping comes from the shaft it sounds like a cell phone ringing
mathias turns his head listening
no one else notices it
but what will we eat
how will we the ringing comes again silencing her
she glances toward the shaft not quite believing what shes hearing
it comes a third time and they all stand up step to the hole peer into its darkness
the ringing comes yet again
a cell phone
it cant be thats a cell phone amy
but theres no signal out here
eric cant get a signal
reflexively eric pulls out his phone checks again nothing
theres another ring
it could be a different network
way down in that hole
how could it pick it up
still another ring
what else can it be
the ringing falls silent
they all stand there staring into the hole
a long beat then it resumes
eric claps his hands ecstatic
the others are starting to smile too
mathias moves to the windlass
he unrolls some of the rope starts to wrap it around his chest
jeff watches him
the vine has taken root on the windlass the sawhorse the barrel the rope
jeff steps forward begins to yank it off careful not to get the sap on his hands
he turns to amy
theres a lamp in the orange tent
see if you can find some matches too
amy hurries off toward the orange tent vanishing inside
theres a final ring and then silence again
mathias is knotting the rope tightly around his chest
amy returns carrying an oil lamp a box of matches
everyone watches as jeff crouches to light the lamp
then he rises turns toward mathias looks at him closely
jeff contd you sure
mathias nods takes the lamp steps to the edge of the hole
jeff and eric move to the windlass they position themselves at the hand crank leaning into it so the rope goes taut
mathias girds himself steps out over the hole
he dangles there for a moment hanging beneath the sawhorse the windlass groaning on its mount
then jeff and eric begin to reverse the crank letting the rope slowly spool out
stacy and amy stand beside the shaft peering into it watching as mathias begins his descent ten feet twenty feet thirty feet down and still only darkness beneath him with
no sign of the shafts bottom
the windlass creaks as it turns jeff and eric strain against it sweating muscles taut
amy has turned from the shaft is watching the rope as it slowly unspools from the barrel
he turns to look and she points at the rope where it comes off the windlass and angles up toward the little wheel hanging from the sawhorse
amy contd the sap
theyd cleared off most of the vine from the rope but not all of it
some of these remaining tendrils have been crushed as the windlass slowly unspools
their sap is darkening the rope in spots eating into it
amy contd i think its jeff immediately turns back to the crank his voice urgent pull him up
eric hasnt grasped whats happening
jeff contd amy jumps forward to help all three of them pushing at the crank getting in each others way the windlass creaking as it begins to turn again slowly
reclaiming the rope
stacy remains beside the shaft peering anxiously into it
mathias is twenty five feet beneath us just beginning to bump his way upward swaying back and forth
he stares up at us confused what is it
the rope beneath the sawhorse is being visibly eaten away its hemp unraveling
stacy turns toward the others pointing terrified
the rope swaps
jeff eric and amy fall forward the windlass spinning wildly behind them freeof its weight
a long beat then theres a distant hollow sounding thump followed instantly by the pop of the lamp shattering
stacy leans to peer into the shaft her hand over her mouth
her voice echoes back at us
theres no response
jeff eric and amy join stacy at the edge of the shaft all of them staring down into the darkness looking horrified
is he theres a groan from below very faint almost inaudible
they listen for a beat but theres only silence
jeff contd i heard him moan
the others dont seem so certain jeff turns to the girls
jeff contd one of you will have to go
jeff nods waving into the shaft
well clear the vine off the rope
and you can why cant you
we have to work the crank
you wont be strong enough
amy and stacy stare at each other its obvious neither of them wants to go
stacy is the one who finally gives in
i can do it
stacy nods but she doesnt look sure
shes hugging herself it seems as if she might start trembling
before anyone can speak that groaning comes from the shaft again louder this time unmistakable
jeff cups his hands shouts mathias
jeff turns to the girls
jeff contd see if you can find a knife
and another lamp
he waves them toward the tents then he and eric begin to unspool the rope from the windlass laying it out across the clearing in long looping circles
the mayans keep coming women now too bearing bundles on their backs
theyre setting up a campsite along the edge of the jungle
the bald man stands in their midst his hands on his hips staring silently up the hillside
the scratch of a match being lit amys hand comes into frame lifts the lamps glass chimney fires the wick
just help him into the sling
then well pull him up
the chimney is carefully replaced as we pull back to reveal amy is crouched adjusting the lamps flame
jeff and eric have mended the rope
we see the excised lengths of spoiled hemp and the ragged looking knots on the rope itself which has been spooled once more around the windlass
theyve fashioned a sling at the ropes end
jeff and eric are helping stacy into it pulling it over her head adjusting it under her armpits
once we get him out well drop the rope back down and pull you up too
amy offers stacy the lamp
stacy is scared yet struggling not to show it
her hands are trembling and the lamp rattles as she takes it
the boys are stepping toward the windlass eric stops glances back at her
stacy nods but without much conviction
eric steps toward her gives her a tight hug
he holds her eyes for a moment kisses her
then he joins jeff at the hand crank
they lean against it and the rope goes taut
stacy steps out into the open air over the shaft the lamp in her right hand
with her left hand she lunges grabs at the sawhorse clings tightly to it
jeff glances toward her from the hand crank
she nods but doesnt relinquish her grip on the sawhorse
jeff contd you have to let go stacy
for a moment it doesnt seem like shell be able to but then with a visible act of will she does and they slowly
begin to let the rope out dropping her into the shaft
she grips the sling with one hand the lamp with the other
wooden supports have been hammered into the walls of the shaft buttressing the dirt
the vine clings to them its leaves and flowers paler than on the hillside above
stacy begins to swing pendulum like as she descends
she tries unsuccessfully to steady herself then glances up
were steadily dropping thirty feet down then forty
amy is at the edge of the shaft peering in at us
stacy smiles up at her
she starts to wave back but is too scared to let go of the sling
she glances down
the light is swaying back and forth with stacy and it causes the shadows beneath us to jump and lurch
theres still no sign of the bottom the windlass continues to creak
a beat and then very faintly mathiass dim shape starts to emerge his white tennis shoes his pale blue t shirt
the lamp picks up bits of broken glass around his body
stacy lifts the lamp peering downward struggling to see more clearly and the sling suddenly jerks to a halt making her squawk
she looks up
the creaking has stopped
were swinging slowly back and forth
we see amy peering down toward us a long way up almost seventy feet
a beat then jeff appears too
his voice has an echo to it
her face is slick with sweat it shines in the lamp light
its the end of the rope
im not at the bottom
can you see him
stacy looks down again holding up the lamp peering toward mathiass motionless body
she lifts her head
is he conscious
i cant tell
i dont think so
how far are you above him
stacy glances down once more trying to quess the distance
a beat hes just lying there
she lifts her head again peers upward
the top of the shaft is empty
very faintly we hear jeff and the others talking just their voices not their words
jeffs head reappears
we have to figure out a way to lengthen the rope
were gonna pull you up
he pulls his head away
shes staring upward
the rope has almost stopped its swaying
jeff steps back to the hole peers into it
so does amy
eric waits by the windlass
the rope is completely played out
stacy shouts her voice echoing slightly i want to stay with him
we have to ill jump
jeff glances at the others
eric shakes his head
jeff calls down to her
we might not be able to make it longer
youll be trapped
what about him
we cant just leave him
well pull you up
then well see
he starts toward the windlass again
the rope jerks and she begins to rise
she kicks her legs lifts her left arm over head wrenches it free of the sling so that only her right arm remains hooked
she switches the lamp from her right hand to her left then slips completely free of the sling the lamp fluttering out as she drops
almost totally dark just a faint fall of light from above
mathias is a dim shape on the floor of the shaft
stacy lands beside him heavily awkwardly the glass from his shattered lamp crunching beneath her
she loses her balance pitches forward onto his body
mathias makes a terrible shrieking sound pure pain flailing his arms
stacy struggles to right herself
im so sorry
she pulls herself into a crouch staring down at him through the dimness his shriek fading to a steady moaning
jeff amy and eric have rushed to the shaft theyre peering into it
theres only darkness beneath them
eric shouts stacy
stacys voice rises toward them sounding
very far away i didnt want him to be alone
what happened to the lamp
it blew out
jeff turns from the shaft picks up the box of matches
he yanks off his shirt ties the box inside it then steps back to the edge of the hole
he calls down to stacy im dropping the matches
jeff holds the knotted bundle over the shaft lets it go
it falls into the darkness
a long beat and then very softly we hear the thump as it lands
contd got it
the three of them stare into the hole waiting for the light
theres the rasp of a match its flickering flame then the stronger illumination of the lamp as stacy lights its wick
mathias lies on his back before her silent now motionless his eyes shut
stacy bends toward him whispers mathias
he doesnt respond its hard to tell if hes conscious
stacy lifts the lamp peers about the shaft
the vine has taken root even at this depth its flowers and leaves pale to the point of translucence
beyond mathias theres an opening in the dirt wall another shaft cutting perpendicularly into the earth
its roof is supported by a stone archway intricately carved
stacy rises as if to investigate but then winces nearly falls
she peers down at her right leg
a large piece of glass is imbedded there just beneath her knee
its the size of a playing card gently concave dark with her blood
she reaches and grimacing pulls it from her body
jeff is at the windlass hurriedly cranking the rope back up
eric and amy stand watching
we need fifteen feet
twenty to be safe
no one speaks
the windlass turns with that steady creaking but its higher pitched now with no weight on the rope
jeff contd come on
how can we the clothes
from the backpacks
we could knot them together
would they hold
eric frowns uncertain
jeff finishes with the rope stands there catching his breath
stacys voice rises toward them from the shaft
i cut my knee
eric hurries to the shaft followed by jeff and amy
they peer over its edge toward stacy so far beneath them in her flickering circle of lamp light
my shoes full of blood
put pressure on it
use my shirt
they all stare down at her waiting
stacy is crouched beside mathias pressing jeffs t shirt to her wound
her khakis and tennis shoe are dark with blood theres a lot of it
she isnt watching mathias he startles her when he opens his eyes and speaks my
his voice is faint and raspy we can hear his pain in it
stacy leans toward him tries to smile reassuringly
stacy turns to look his legs are lying at an odd angle as if he were a doll that had been carelessly tossed there
jeff eric and amy still watching jeff turns to the others
what about the tents
we could take one down cut the nylon into strips
eric and amy glance toward the tents debating
would it be strong enough
we can braid them three strips for each section
then knot the sections together for strength
before either of them can respond stacys voice emerges from the shaft sounding scared i think he broke his back
they fall silent staring down at her
contd he cant move his legs
and it smells
like he lost his bowels
very quietly oh no
jeff turns to her
how can we make a backboard
amy starts to shake her head looking horrified
we cant move him
one of the frames from the backpacks
and the tent poles
theres tape in the orange tent
he doesnt wait for a response he leans over the shaft jeff contd we have to builda backboard stacy
it might take a while
theres a long hesitation as if stacy is searching for some alternative
then still sounding frightened and faraway okay
amy is shaking her head growing frantic well make it worse
well jostle him and hell jeff turns toward her with a hint of exasperation we cant just leave him down there
you know that dont you
she starts to back away toward the edge of the clearing
we have to tell them
we have to tell them whats happened
jeff gives her an incredulous look
she keeps retreating shes almost at the path
amy contd they can send for help
theyre not gonna we have to may
we have to she spins starts off at a run vanishing down the trail
jeff calls after her shouting amy
but shes gone
jeff turns to eric
jeff contd stay here
and then he too is running
the mayans have established their campsite on the edge of the jungle
two women are beside a campfire plucking a pair of chickens
we see other campsites in the distance other campfires hugging the jungles margin surrounding the hill
three men sit in the center of the clearing facing the hillside their bows in their laps
they rise suddenly peering up the trail
the women pause in their labor also staring
the campsite goes quiet
amy is sprinting toward us down the trail
jeff is ten yards behind her also running
the three mayans nock arrows
two other men step forward to join them
one has a bow the other is the bald mayan with the pistol
he unholsters it and as amy reaches the bottom of the trail raises it aiming at her chest
amy stops just short of the clearing sweating breathless scared looking
she lifts her hands palms up beseeching
someones been hurt
he jeff comes to a halt five feet behind her
they cant understand you
she turns her voice quickened with panic say it in spanish
tell them he they dont speak spanish
you have to try
she spins back toward the mayans takes a step into the clearing
the bald man shouts at her a single short sentence in mayan
amy holds out her hands to him
amy contd espanol
jeff steps forward grabs her elbow
they killed henrich
why would amy tries to tug free but he wont let her
she starts to shout at the mayans help usi we need help
the mayans just stare at her their weapons raised their faces expressionless
one of them is much younger than the others almost a boy
he says something in mayan to the bald man and the bald man shakes his head
amy begins to cry
jeff pulls at her elbow
we have to get back
amy turns toward him her face smeared with tears
i didnt want to come
i told you we shouldnt
i said jeff tightens his grip on her arm gives her a little shake as if to wake her up
listen to me
mathias needs our help
he we shouldnt even be here
why did you say wed come
she wipes at her tears you have to do something
rising toward a shout you have to
its your fault
its all your jeff shakes her again more roughly his voice like a slap
yd q stepped onto the hill
amy stares at him startled into silence
jeff contd they wouldnt have forced us up it if you hadnt
he holds her eyes making sure she understands
then jeff contd now lets go okay
he starts to pull her back toward the trail
she allows herself to be led shes begun to cry again i didnt know
i just shes growing increasingly upset almost sobbing
she tries to turn back toward the mayans again but jeff wont let her
amy contd they have to help us
theyre not going to
they have to
she wrenches herself free stumbles falls into the vines beside the trail
jeff reaches for her but she kicks away from him grabbing at the vines scrambling to her feet
as she rises she yanks up a tendril a clot of earth hanging from its roots
she screams spinning toward the clearing amy contd and throws the tendril at the mayans
they scramble backward with surprising panic shouting
the youngest of them is too slow the length of vine hits him in the leg
he stares down at the tendril in shock
the others back hurriedly away from him
two of them continue to point their weapons at amy but the bald man and one of the other bowmen are aiming at the young mayan now
theres shouting from the tree line
the entire campsite is on its feet a woman begins to scream
shes in her forties short and stout and she starts forward into the clearing arms stretched toward the young mayan
two of the other women grab her hold her back
the bald mayan starts to address the young man pointing up the hillside
the short woman keeps screaming flailing trying to break free
the young mayan looks at her then at the bald man
he speaks in mayan a brief burst of words
the bald man shakes his head points up the hill again his pistol aimed at the young mans chest
the short woman is wailing eyes shut
the young mayan takes a step toward her calling what seems to be her name
the bald man shouts at him but the young mayan ignores him takes a second step then a third
the bowmen are all aiming at him now and suddenly everyone seems to be yelling
the young mayan takes a fifth step holding out his arms toward the wailing woman calling to her
the bald man fires shooting him in the head
at the same instant the bowmen let their arrows fly the shafts thumping into the young mans chest burying themselves to the fletches
the clearing goes still the only sound is the womans steady wailing
then the bald man swings his pistol toward amy and jeffs he shouts in mayan at them
the other mayans nock fresh arrows draw their bows
jeff takes a step backward half raising his hands
amy just stands there her eyes on the young mayans motionless body
no reaction she turns finally
she looks horrified stupefied her hands are burned a deep red from the vines sap
jeff waves her up the hill
she stares at him for another beat and then without a word starts to climb the trail
jeff hesitates watching the mayans the bloodied corpse the raised weapons the keening woman
then he too turns and hurries off up the trail
amy jeff and eric have taken down the blue tent its contents lie tumbled in a pile in the little clearing
all three of them look sun struck sweat stained worn out
eric is using a knife to cut long strips from the blue nylon
amy is braiding three of the strips together
jeff has one of the backpack frames the roll of duct tape and some of the poles from the tent hes making a backboard
maybe we could use it as a weapon you know
wrap it around some stones or something
and throw them like grenades
i mean if theyre that scared of it jeff tears off a piece of tape with his teeth
they have guns eric
what do you think theyll do if we start throwing the vine at them
eric is silenced by this
he cuts another long strip of nylon passes it to amy
but he cant seem to stop himself from talking so you figure its what
sacred or something
like you touch it and you have to die
amy begins to cry suddenly a sob quickly suppressed
jeff and eric both turn to look at her
the vines sap has scarred her hands and arms almost to the elbows
she wipes her eyes takes a deep breath shakes her head
but she doesnt look it
jeff removes his hat holds it out
amy just stares at it he nods for her to take it
she reaches for the hat puts it on then wipes at her eyes again
jeff leans forward touches her
jeff contd were gonna get through this
well pull them up
i dont know well figure things out
it has to rain at some point
and maybe we can snare some birds
the electronic ringing sounds once more from the bottom of the shaft
they all turn to stare
the oil lamp has begun to smoke adding a haze to the light
stacy is beside mathias holding his hand
shes still pressing jeffs shirt to her wound
the ring sounds again
mathias turns his head peers toward the shaft cut into the dirt wall to his left thats where its coming from
stacy reaches to pick up the lamp rises to her feet
jeff shouts down from above stacy
stacy ignores him she limps around mathias starts toward the opening
she hesitates at the mouth of the shaft lifting her lamp to see better
theres another ring
the lamps light doesnt penetrate very far but we can see that the vine has taken root here with great avidity it grows thickly on the walls floor and roof
theres a steady draft coming toward us and the plant shifts in it rustling
stacy stands there looking scared
theres another ring
can you see it
stacy lifts her head shouts no
she keeps peering into the shadows not moving
the ringing falls silent
stacy turns hobbles back toward mathias and the light shudders dims for a moment
she squints at it the oil is nearly gone
she shouts up to the others stacy contd the lamps almost out of oil
then blow it out
stacy seems terrified by this
blow it out
well need it when we come down
to get him on the backboard
stacy drops into a crouch beside mathias sets the lamp down before her stares at it
she clearly doesnt want to blow it out
mathias watches her silent
contd all right
stacy leans forward lifts the lamps glass chimney blows out the flame dropping the shaft into darkness
sun is just touching the horizon the sky turning red
th eyve tied the braids of nylon onto the rope attached the finished backboard to them
it rests beside the shaft padded with one of the archaeologists sleeping bags
jeff and eric remove their belts drop them onto the backboard
they step to the windlass lean against its hand crank the rope going taut
amy stands by the shaft gathering her courage
then she reaches for the backboard
mathias and stacy are two dim shapes in the darkness
the windlass begins its creaking
a long beat and then stacy
light the lamp
stacy shifts once again theres the rasp of a match then the stronger illumination of the lamp as she lights its wick
mathiass eyes are shut theres a deep raggedness to his breathing
stacy looks upward
the backboard is dropping toward us
above it the light is already fading from the sky
stacy rises to her feet lifting the lamp
shes dropping slowly down the shaft clenching the nylon braids her eyes tightly shut terrified
the backboard sways pendulum like as it descends almost touching the vine covered walls
when the backboard comes within reach stacy grabs it pulling it to the right so that it will come to rest at mathiass side
but then with three feet still to go it jerks to a halt almost toppling amy from her perch
a beat and jeffs voice comes toward them from above have you reached them
a few more feet
amy leans peers down at mathiass broken body
i dont know
were out of rope
a beat can you still do it
amy looks at stacy neither speaks
finally quietly well have to send it back up i guess
amy doesnt answer
she shifts her weight and the backboard starts to swing
stacy reaches to steady it
stacy contd blow out the lamp
wait here in the dark
amy is silent staring down at mathiass still form its obvious she doesnt want to do this
stacy contd or we could try to lift him maybe
stacy persists stacy contd one of us at his shoulders
the other his feet
if he twists its only a few feet
once more amy is silent
stacy lifts the lamp examining it the diminishing pool of oil
d we have to decide
the lights not going to last
jeffs voice comes toward them from above again amy
they both look up the sky has grown too dark to see him
amy hesitates one beat more then yells were gonna try itt she climbs off the backboard crouches beside mathias
stacy sets down the lamp
amy contd mathias
she touches his shoulder and he opens his eyes stares at her
he looks haggard ashen
amy contd were going to lift you okay
were going to hoist you up and out
mathias stares from her to the backboard to stacy
he shuts his eyes
amy stands up drags the belts off the backboard drops them next to the lamp
she positions herself behind mathiass head stacy hobbles to his feet limping
amy contd his hips
stacy hesitates looking doubtful
if you lift from his feet hell bend at the waist
but if i lift at his hips wont he arch his back
they both stare down at mathis imagining these two different scenarios
amy glances toward the lamp its dwindling oil
stacy crouches by mathiass knees a little off balance favoring her wounded leg
amy bends sliding her hands under his shoulders
mathias groans and stacy starts to pull away but amy shakes her head
amy contd quickly
they count together one
they lift and mathias immediately starts to scream
his body sags at the waist he begins to thrash his arms
stacy starts to set him down but amy shakes her head shouts no
stacys wounded leg is hindering her she cant keep up with amy
mathiass shoulders are level with the backboard but his knees are still a good foot beneath it
he keeps screaming
the bend at his waist increases
amy contd lift i stacy tries to hoist him higher lunging his torso twisting his screams going louder
his right arm hits the backboard sends it swinging
the girls toss him toward it
the sun has set
theres a half moon giving us just enough light to dimly see eric and jeff peering into the shaft
mathiass screams echo up toward them
mathias has fallen silent
he lies on the backboard eyes clenched sweat beading his forehead
stacy is trying not to cry
she watches amy buckle the two belts together then drape them over mathiass chest knot them tight
amy strips off her own belt gestures for stacy to do the same
she buckles these together too
i have to pee
she limps toward the wall lowers her pants gingerly crouches
she stares toward the other shaft as she pees its stone archway the shifting shadows the vine rustling softly in the steady draught
amy binds mathias at his thighs
she whispers to him you okay
she waits but he doesnt respond
his eyes remain shut
stacy rises buttoning her pants limps back toward amy
shes on the edge of tears is working hard to fight them off
amy lifts her head shouts up to jeff amy contd pull him up
a moments pause then the windlass begins to creak once more
the backboard slowly rises swaying gently
they watch it climb away from them
amy holds out her hand
any contd here
stacy just stares at her not understanding
amy nods at the lamp the oil is gone
amy contd its gonna go out
and its true as stacy reaches for amys hand the light suddenly flickers dims drops them into darkness
the mayans are settling into sleep at their campsite
three of the men remain on guard duty in the clearing facing the hillside their backs to the fire
the young mayans corpse still lies in the dirt fifteen feet in front of them
the firelight throws shadows across his bloodied body
the windlass creaks loudly as eric and jeff work to wind in the rope
stacy has already been pulled up from the hole
shes sitting beside mathias whos lying on the backboard on the edge of the clearing by the orange tent
amy emerges from the shaft dangling beneath the sawhorse
jeff holds the rope taut while eric steps to the hole pulls amy toward him
stacy watches from beside the backboard
mathiass eyes are shut his breathing rough with phlegm
no one speaks
once amy is free of the sling they all move to the backboard
eric takes stacys hand jeff crouches starts to undo the belts
shouldnt we carry him into the tent first
jeff pulls free the first belt shifts to the second one
hes gonna keep leaking urine
but we cant just leave him out in the open
well rig a shelter
with whats left of the blue tent
jeff pulls the second belt free
mathiass eyes remain shut
jeff contd one of us should stay on watch while the others sleep
two hour shifts
he reaches for his knapsack unzips it
he pulls out a liter bottle of water
jeff contd once its light well figure out how much water we have and how to ration it
for now i think we should each just take a single swig
he uncaps the bottle hands it to amy
he watches her drink from it
when shes done she passes it to stacy
jeff contd eric and ill build the shelter
then ill take the first shift
you two should try to sleep
stacy takes her single sip passes the bottle to eric
stacy and amy have pushed the camping supplies into a pile along the tents rear wall
stacy pulls off her pants bends to examine her wound in the darkness
amy is beside her lying on her side
a beat of silence
then whispering amy
we shouldnt have lifted him should we
amy reaches pats stacys hand
hes never gonna walk again
hes dont stacy
itll only make things worse
stacy falls silent
amy contd just go to sleep okay
lets try to go to sleep
stacy lies down next to amy in her underwear and t shirt
they huddle close together in the darkness
eric is building a tiny lean to for mathias using the duct tape the leftover nylon and poles from the blue tent
jeff crouches over the backboard
he starts to cut mathiass jeans off him with the knife
mathiass eyes remain shut
whatre you doing
we have to keep him clean
he slices the jeans from ankle to hip first one leg then the other struggling not to jostle mathiass body
jeff contd thats how itll happen i think
if it does
if what does
jeff slides the soiled strips of denim out from under mathiass body tosses them aside
he lowers his voice
if he dies here
blood poisoning something like that
eric seems startled by this
you think hes gonna die
he shrugs his back is broken
who knows what else
eric is silent motionless the tape in his hand
mathiass breathing seems to be getting steadily worse
jeff bends to cut off his boxers first one leg then the other
he tosses the soiled fabric aside
jeff contd we should go back down in the morning
into the shaft
try to find the phone again
theres no oil for the lamp
jeff waves toward the orange tent
we could pour it on some of the clothes tie them around one of these poles make a torch
a sleeping bag is lying in the clearing among the strips of nylon and aluminum poles
jeff steps over to pick it up
jeff contd without the phone hes dead
if we have to wait for someone to come searching
he shakes his head
then he leans forward and carefully drapes the sleeping bag across mathiass broken body
the orange nylon is just starting to glow with the suns arrival
stacy and eric lie beneath one of the sleeping bags erics head on her shoulder
jeff lies curled on his side a few feet away still shirtless
jeffs eyes open
he sits up stares about then reaches for one of the backpacks
he quietly digs through it till he finds a t shirt
he sniffs at it then pulls it on
mathias lies on his backboard eyes shut his breathing still sounding thick with phlegm
amy sits beside him hunched into herself half drowsing
she lifts her head as jeff emerges from the tent stares at him
how is he
she shrugs tired
once the others are up well have some water
his face is stubbled sweat stained
he looks ragged they both do
he steps to the opposite side of the clearing unzips begins to urinate with his back to amy
the vine covers everything tangled and matted with those odd knoll like growths scattered among it
the nearest is thirty feet away
its leaves are swaying slightly in a faint breeze and we see a flash of yellowish white beneath them
jeff finishes shakes zips then steps out into the vine wading toward the tiny mound
amy remains beside the backboard she watches him crouch part the tendrils stare
what is it
jeff gestures for her to approach
when she reaches him he leans forward pulls aside the vines
we see a mans skull a loose tumble of bones
amy inhales sharply recoiling
all of them
he waves across the hilltop at the other mounds there are more than a dozen
amy takes them in
the light is gaining strength the green leaves seeming to shine in it the red flowers to glow
jeffs face assumes a puzzled expression
jeff contd where are the birds
its dawn there should be birds
they both stare off across the hillside so quiet so still
stacy opens her eyes
she lies there struggling to orient herself with eric on her shoulder
she starts to roll onto her side then stops looking confused
she reaches under the sleeping bag toward her leg her confusion changing to alarm
she site up jarring eric awake and throws back the sleeping bag
the vine has grown dramatically during the night reaching out from the pile of supplies at the rear of the tent to spread across stacys right leg almost to her
she sits up tries to push it off her
oh my god
the vine is clinging to her she has to tear it the sap shining slickly on her hands visibly beginning to burn the skin
she yanks at the tendrils tossing them aside
stacy contd help me
eric sits up still only half awake
he just stares
its inside me
its true one of the tendrils has pushed its way into the wound on her leg widening it thrusting itself a full three inches into her body like a thick
d oh jesus its fucking inside me
she tries to pull the tendril out but shes too panicky too quick and the vine breaks leaving a piece of itself snagged under her skin
stacy starts to scream stacy contd get the knifes eric is too shocked to stir
hes staring down at her leg at the bulge beneath her skin it looks as if its moving
stacys screaming continues
jeff and amy are on their feet hurrying across the clearing
mathias has opened his eyes
get the knife
jeff bends scoops up the knife starts toward the tent
he waves toward mathias
stay with him
then he ducks in through the tents flap
eric is beside stacy trying to calm her shes started to cry
her hands and wrists have turned a dark red and the tendril is inside her leg just to the left of her shin running parallel to it
what is it
its inside her
stacy points to her wound sobbing now cut it out
you gotta cut it out
the blades dirty
we should stacy starts shaking her head frantic its moving
cant you see
jeff stares at the bulge hesitating
then it moves unquestionably contracting and expanding like a worm
stacy shrieks stacy contd jeff
be gives in crouching over her leg
its gonna hurt
he leans forward slices into the skin above the bulge
stacy cries out starts to jerk away but jeff presses down on her leg holding her still
he reaches into her wound with his finger digs out the piece of vine tosses it aside
get me a shirt or something
he gestures toward the backpacks and eric unzips one of them starts to dig through it
he pulls out a t shirt hands it to jeff
jeff wads it up uses it to put pressure on the incision staunching the flow of blood
amy is crouched by the backboard watching the tent trying to grasp whats happening
mathias startles her by speaking somethings
his voice is thick sounding very faint
amy tries to soothe him she puts her hand on his shoulder
its just my legs
gonna get you show
hes struggling to rise straining upward
amy tries to stop him pressing down on his shoulder
but he fights her he wont be quieted show me
so she leans lifts the sleeping bag off him
his lower legs are completely covered by the flowering vine from the knees down
amy and mathias both stare in surprise
then amy reaches starts to yank the tendrils free
jeff is leaning forward pressing the balled up t shirt against stacys wound the blood darkening the fabric
stacy is lying there her eyes shut fists clenched
i can still feel it
jeff shakes his head
i got it out
i can feel it moving
thats just your body
your muscle twitching
its on our clothes
stacy and jeff both glance at him
theres a faint almost fungus like green growing on his shirt an infantile version of the vine covering the hillside all around them
its on all of them their shirts their pants their shoes
before any of them can respond to this development amy starts to call from the clearing sounding scared jeff
they all turn toward the flap
mathias begins to scream
amys voice jumps in volume amy o
i jeff rises moves toward the flap
amy is crouched over mathias frantically yanking the vines off him
mathias is struggling impotently to sit up
he continues to scream staring down at his legs
jeff emerges from the tent hurries to help amy both of them tearing at the vine a flash of white appearing beneath the green shiny and bright bones
mathiass legs have been stripped completely clean of flesh from the knee down
as they keep pulling the tendrils free blood starts to drip from mathiass knees slowly at first but then suddenly spurting spraying them their chests their faces
amy jerks backward gagging retching
she jumps up takes three steps into the center of the clearing and vomits her hands on her knees
she wipes at the blood on her face coughs spits then bends again another long ribbon of puke slipping free of her
mathias continues to scream and thrash
jeff reaches for the belts lying in the dirt beside the backboard
he quickly ties first one then another around mathiass legs twisting them into tourniquets cutting off the flow of blood
stacy and eric stoop out through the tents flap they stand there staring struggling to grasp whats happened
stacy is in her underwear and t shirt blood still seeping down her leg
amy turns to face them
mathias is weeping now his eyes shut
the hemorrhaging has stopped blood lies in puddles across the backboard
jeff is covered with it
and then there are the bones so white so wet looking from the knees down nothing but bone
suddenly stacy starts to scream pointing past amy at the dirt beyond her
they all turn to look
the vine is in motion a long tendril slipping into the clearing moving snakelike toward the puddle of vomit at amys feet
amy backs quickly away
a second tendril emerges from the low wall of green around the clearing then a third
they move rapidly as if racing each other both of them slipping alongside the first into the little pool of vomit
the tendrils absorb the puke draining it until all thats left is a damp shadow on the rocky soil
then they withdraw back across the clearing silently retreating into the larger mass of green
stacy keeps screaming
faintly from up the hill we hear stacys screams
the mayans are finishing their morning meal
they eat in silence showing no reaction to the sound
in the clearing the young mayans corpse is buried beneath a thick growth of vine
the four of them are sitting by the orange tent
jeff and amy are still spattered and smeared with mathiass blood stacy is still in her underwear
jeff is inventorying their food and water
the others watch as he puts the perishables in a separate pile two bananas a plastic bag ofgrapes going brown an orange a soggy tuna fish sandwich
they mustve dug it up
he arranges the rest of the food in a second pile a bag of pretzels a can of nuts two protein bars a box of raisins
he puts the liquids in a third pile three bottles of water two of iced tea a can of coke
thats all there is
jeff contd and then the mayans cleared the jungle around the hill i guess
to keep it quarantined
thats why they wont let us leave dont you think
theyre afraid well spread it
the others are silent
jeff reaches for the tuna fish sandwich
he carefully unwraps it
jeff contd or else
i dont know
maybe its something religious
and were some sort of sacrifice
he glances at the others but once again no one responds
they all look dazed knocked back into themselves
jeff picks up the knife wipes it on his jeans
jeff contd they mustve done the same thing with the archaeologists
trapped them here
he cuts the sandwich into four equal sections
jeff contd and then somehow it killed them off
all of them
one by one
this is too much for eric he
leaps up looking panicky
we have to find the phone
we have to go back down and jeff makes a calming motion
well eat first
drink some water
we have to stay calm
not rush at things
he holds out one of the tiny squares of sandwich
eric hesitates then accepts it dropping back into a crouch
jeff hands amy her square
what about mathias
she nods toward him and they all turn to look
from his knees down mathiass legs are nothing but bone tendon and ropy clots of blackened blood
his face looks gray
his eyes are shut and his breathing sounds terribly ragged
he wouldnt be able to stomach it
jeff offers stacy her ration
she takes it but almost absentmindedly
she seems distracted she keeps prodding at her wound with her fingertip
jeff contd stop it stacy
its still in there
i can feel it
she keeps probing
jeff shakes his head a little it atient i told you
i got it out
jeff pops his square of sandwich into his mouth eric and amy eat theirs too
stacys ration remains in her hand she seems to have forgotten it
shes sunburned sweat stained glassy eyed
eric leans toward her looking worried
you have to eat
she places the tiny sandwich into her mouth chews swallows staring at her wound the whole time
how puffy it is
thats just swelling
he turns toward jeff right
he nods its what happens when you get hurt
jeff picks up one of the water bottles twists off its cap
he offers the bottle to stacy
jeff contd one swallow apiece
the bottle makes its way around their little circle
when it returns to jeff he takes his sip caps the bottle
eric is watching stacy her anxious probing he looks increasingly distressed by it
he jumps up again
lets find the phone
jeff doesnt move
stacys bloodied khakis
are lying in the dirt beside him and he reaches for them starts to cut off their legs with the knife just above the knee
we need to take care of mathias first
he wont last much longer like that
amy looks appalled she makes a shushing motion
they all glance toward mathias again
he lies there eyes shut breathing in and out with that fluid filled rasp
he seems to be unconscious but jeff still lowers his voice we have to cut them off
cut what off
hes finished with stacys khakis theyve been transformed into a pair of shorts
he tosses them toward her
eric and amy are staring at him shocked into silence
then youre joking
hell die if we dont
there wont be any pain
he has no feeling beneath his waist
hell lose too much blood
the tourniquets are already in place
well cut below them
jeff holds up the knife
eric scoffs at the idea eric contd that wouldnt do a thing
youd need a bone saw
we could break the bones
amy is shaking her head she looks mortified
what about infection
cutting into him with a dirty knife
well sterilize it
build a fire
heat the blade in the flames
itll cauterize as it cuts
youll kill him
or save him
one or the other
we cant just cut me first
stacy has stood up pulled on the shorts jeff has fashioned for her
shes bent over pointing at a spot on her leg a few inches below the last incision
stacy centd sterilize the knife and eric steps toward her tries to soothe her
theres nothing there stacy
its she hardly seems to hear him
shes frightened growing a little wild with it
her voice comes fast and high its moving
i can feel it moving
youre imagining it
youre scared and you i gotta get out of here
i gotta get to a hospital
i gotta eric takes her hand squeezing it
stacy blinks at him close to tears
you have to calm down
can you do that
can you try to calm down
stacy pulls free of him drops into a crouch hugging her knees to her chest her eyes shut
see if theres a signal
check your phone
eric doesnt move he knows theres no point
stacy contd check it
eric sighs steps to his pack crouches to remove his phone
he flips it open holds it out to stacy
she stares down at it theres no signal
eric drops it back into his pack
then he turns to jeff
we go back down
we find the other phone
we call for help
thats how we get out of here
thats how we save him
it take too long
one call jeff
theyll be here by sundown
and mathias will already be dying
theres no flesh covering his bones
theyre mathiass voice interrupts him from the backboard
very hoarse barely audible do
they all turn stare toward him
his eyes are open
mathias contd please
a beat cut
he slowly painfully extends his left hand toward them a beseeching gesture
a pair of shorts a womans blouse two black socks
ill have to break the bones first
an amber liquid is being poured onto the clothes very slowly
we pull back to reveal eric is crouched dribbling the tequila onto the clothes pausing to let it soak in saturating the fabric
jeff is kneeling by the backboard talking to mathias
with the stone
then ill use the knife to cut
a large stone sits beside the pile of clothes shaped like an ax head
theres the knife too and the metal canteen from the orange tent
jeff contd well heat the canteen and cauterize the wounds with it
to stop the bleeding
eric strikes a match the clothes catch instantly burning with a low blue flame
he sets the knife in the fire then the stone and splashes more tequila on them
the girls stand in the center of the clearing watching
jeff contd you shouldnt be able to feel a thing
but you can bite this if you want
just in case
he holds up one of the belts
mathias hesitates then opens his mouth and jeff sets it carefully inside
mathias clamps down gripping it between his teeth
jeff glances at eric
jeff contd ready
the stone is making a cracking sound in the fire glowing a
jeff turns back to mathias
jeff contd you
mathias also nods shutting his eyes
theres a small towel in the dirt beside jeff and he
picks it up wrapping it around his hand
he looks over his shoulder at the girls
they both seem terrified shaky with it
jeff contd you should wait in the tent
amy starts to shake her head but then stacy is in motion grabbing her hand pulling her across the clearing and she lets herself be led
jeff watches them vanish through the flap then reaches toward the fire with his towel swathed hand
he scoops up the stone raises it over his head slams it down with all his strength against the exposed bones of mathiass left leg
mathias bucks groaning his eyes jump open
jeff drops the stone back into the fire
snatches out the knife
mathias is trying to rise onto his elbow straining to see whats happening
jeff contd hold him
eric sets the canteen into the flames sloshes some tequila on it then shifts
to the backboard
he presses down on mathiass shoulders
mathias is whimpering twisting his head back and forth gripping the belt tightly in his teeth
jeff starts to saw with the knife chopping and cutting the splintered bones
bloody marrow spills wetly out and then mathiass
lower leg comes free of his body the foot and ankle and shin bones completely separate now
jeff lifts the bones away drops them into the dirt beside the backboard
then he turns uses the towel to pluck the canteen out of the fire it too is glowing red
he presses the canteen flat against mathiass stump the flesh sizzling and spitting
mathias bucks even more forcefully he spits out the belt cries out stop
jeff ignores him dropping the canteen back into the fire lifting out the stone
eric looks increasingly mortified he seems close to tears
reep him still
he turns smashes the stone into mathiass right leg
mathias begins to scream bucking against erics grip
mathiass screams fill the tent
amy and stacy are sitting together clutching each other stacy is crying
amy is staring toward the flap with a look of horror
jeff saws and chops at the shattered bones with the knife
mathias continuesto scream
eric is using all his weight to hold him still his head averted his eyes clenched shut
jeff lifts the severed bones
away from the backboard drops them at his side
then he scoops up the canteen again
as he presses it to mathiass stump mathias finally passes out his body going slack his screams falling silent
for a long beat theres just the spitting snapping sound of mathiass flesh being seared
then eric pulls back into a crouch shaking his head looking utterly depleted
amy emerges from the tent then stacy
they stand staring
he felt it didnt he
the whole thing
jeff lifts the canteen away
he couldnt have
he was screaming
be was telling you to stop
it was just seeing it
looking down and amy is shaking her head staring at mathias with that appalled expression his slack face his burned stumps
this is bad jeff
jeff leans to loosen first one tourniquet then the other
weve bought him some time
he wouldnt have you cut off his legs
you stacy screams pointing toward mathiass amputated limbs
theyre lying in the dirt at the base of the backboard the bloodstained bones held together with a few remaining cords of flesh
a vine has come snaking into the clearing its wrapping itself around one of the feet
as the tendril begins to drag
the bones away a
second one slithers forward and lays claim to the other foot
eric grabs the knife jumps up steps on the first tendril bends to slash at it with the blade
he swoops toward the second one
even as he does so though a third tendril slithers into the clearing then a fourth
stacy screams again short and loud and backs toward the tent eric bends and slashes bends and slashes and thevine keeps coming from all directions reaching for the bones
eric ignores him cutting and stomping and tearing at the tendrils faster and faster but still too slow the vine fighting back wrapping itself around his legs
jeff contd eric
he steps toward him grabs his arm pulls him away
they stand side by side watching as the vine pulls the severed limbs into itself the white of the bones vanishing into the larger mass of green
stacy has begun to cry again
theres a beat of stillness and then once more echoing up toward them from the shaft comes that faint electronic ringing of the cell phone
spinning the rope spooling quickly off the barrel
i dont know how long it burn
eric is pulling the rope off the windlass laying it out in a long zigzag across the clearing
jeff is crouched by the shaft making a torch
the girls stand over him watching
so youll have to be quick
he has one of the aluminum poles from the blue tent
hes wrapped duct tape around its bottom for a grip tied some of the archaeologists clothes around the top
hes dribbling tequila on the knot of fabric saturating it
jeff contd wait to light it till youre both down there
jeff looks up at her startled by the question
eric is moving along the length of rope bent low checking its hemp for signs of weakness
you and amy
they all look bad but stacy looks the worst her wounded leg her greasy hair a panicky edge to every gesture
she shakes her head with vehemence
jeff caps the tequila bottle gives stacy a tired look
weve already been through this
eric and i need to work the winch
youre not strong enough
eric has reached the end of the rope he stands up wiping his hands on his pants
he moves to the windlass starts to wind the rope back onto the barrel
theyve tied a sling on the ropes end again
stacy is pressing her right hand against the bottom of her rib cage massaging probing why cant amy go on her own
the torch wont last that long
we need you both there searching
stacy starts shaking her head again terrified im not going
you dont have a choice stacy
amy can see where this is headed she tries to divert it
ill go alone
jeff ignores this
he rises to his feet still focused on stacy
we can hear his growing anger in his voice if we dont find the phone mathias will die
stacy is silent hugging herself staring at the ground
eric has finished winding the rope onto the windlass
he tries to intervene jeff ignores him his gaze on stacy
so thats what youre saying
just to be clear
that youre not willing to help him live
come on man
shes too scared
i dont give a fuck
im scared too
we all are
it was inside her
and we got it out
now she needs to stop being such a fucking baby stop being so selfish and eric is stepping toward him suddenly right up against him forcing him back a step
hes bigger than jeff stronger and this is suddenly very palpable
their faces are three inches apart
a tense beat and then more quietly eric contd youre being too hard
jeff gives him a look of incredulity almost disgust
just leave her be
jeff turns away from him from all three of them
he stares off across the hill for a beat then shakes his head
im the only one thinking
im carrying the whole fucking load
lay it down
jeff turns back to him gives him a look of pure contempt we can hear his fury rising again as he speaks this isnt just going to work out on
its own eric
im not saying
we could end up dead here
all of us
is that what you want
of course not
then get the fuck out of my way and start helping me
he holds erics eyes long enough to confirm that eric isnt going to protest then he glances past him at stacy
jeff contd you going or not
stacy is still staring at the ground her hand probing at her chest
its clear she doesnt want to go but jeff has shamed her into silence
amy reaches touches her arm
be right there
well be together the whole time
a long beat then stacy manages a nod
its enough for jeff he pushes past eric moving toward the windlass
get in the sling amy
amy turns reaching for the sling
a faint fall of light from above
theres the creaking of the windlass amy is dropping slowly toward us
when her feet touch the bottom of the shaft she scrambles out of the sling
then she lifts her head shouts pull it up
the creaking resumes
she stands there in the dimness watching the sling rise away from her
she has the makeshift torch in one hand the box of matches in the other
eric is helping stacy into the sling pulling it over her head stacys hands are shaking badly
eric hugs her trying to calm her
jeff waits beside the hand crank
amy is in a crouch
she keeps glancing toward the stone arch cut into the shafts wall and the passageway beyond it the vine dangles from
the low ceiling like streamers at a party
the creaking resumes and amy looks up
stacy is dropping slowly toward us
amy glances toward the arch again
a slight draft blows steadily from it and the vine shifts and trembles in it
a beat then the ringing starts up once more
its coming from within the shadowed passageway
amy opens the box of matches plucks one out
shes too jumpy though her hands are trembling so much that she shakes the match out as soon as its lit
theres a second ring
stacy has nearly reached us
amy digs another match from the box
stacys feet touch the bottom of the shaft she yanks off the sling
theres a third ring
amy strikes the match holds it to the knot of clothing at the end of the aluminum pole
the alcohol catches with a fluttering sound a cloud of pale blue fire materializing around the torch
amy lifts it and they start into stacy is in front with amy right behind her
the torch shudders weakly in the steady draft the shafts ceiling is low enough that they have to crouch as they move forward
theres a fourth ring drawing them deeper down the passage
the tendrils hanging from the ceiling brush against them
the vine is growing on the floor too knee deep and from the walls on either side
amy is moving cautiously squinting into the darkness and stacy starts to pull ahead
she pauses lifting the torch but stacy keeps going
amy peers at the vine hanging from the wall
theres a fifth ring echoing eerily and the flowers move in exact unison with the sound their stamens vibrating like so many miniature tuning forks the plant is making the
amy contd stacy
the shaft dead ends at a blank wall which is just materializing out of the darkness fifteen feet in front of them
theres a sixth ring
stacy points at the wall quickening her pace
its right here
i can amy jumps forward reaching for her
but theres another ring and stacy keeps going shes nearly at the wall
amy grabs her arm hard jerks her back a step pulling her close the torchlight flickering over them
she whispers amy contd theres no phone
a seventh ring sounds seeming to come from beneath the vines on the floor of the shaft directly in front of them
stacy tries to pull free to bend and reach toward the sound
stacy contd i can amy jerks her back again whispers straight into her ear its the vine
theyre making the noise
its she pulls free steps forward and her foot seems to punch straight through the shafts floor
she screams losing her balances amy throws down the torch lunges for her
the torch flutters pales but remains lit
the vines growing across the floor fall away revealing an opening another shaft dropping into the earth
stacy is slowly sliding into it scrambling to stop herself
amy grabs stacy arm
stacy is dangling from the waist down over the holes edge
there are vines in the hole too and
they begin to coil around her legs pulling at her dragging her downward
stacy screams again kicking to free herself scrambling upward monkey like while amy pulls at her and finally they manage to drag her to safety
a beat then amy retrieves the torch holds it out over the hole
the bottom is twenty feet down almost lost in shadow
dimly we see a woman lying curled against the wall she has long dark hair
stacy contd oh my god
the woman stirs her body rolling as if to turn and look at us and we see her face shes a corpse
the vine has invaded her flesh its in her eye sockets the hollow of her mouth writhing and churning
stacy and amy scream
theres a whistling sound like a whip and a tendril lashes out from the shafts wall wraps itself around the torchs handle yanks it from amys grip
the torch falls into the hole still burning
when it hits bottom a mass of vine surges across it smothering its flame
its very dark after this amy and stacy are barely discernible
a beat of silence then an odd high pitched cackling rises all around them it sounds like laughter eerie childlike full of echoes
as it steadily increases in volume that whistling comes once more the vines smack at them from the floor the ceiling the walls coiling around their bodies pulling them toward
the open shaft
they both scream again scrambling backward while the vine keeps coming more and more of it grabbing at their arms their legs their necks
they stumble over each other falling onto their hands and knees
the vine catches at them tries to hold them down
its not strong enough though they yank it off and thrash their way foot by foot back toward the sling the vine lashing at them grabbing tearing sap leaking onto
the laughter grows still louder the whole shaft echoing with it
amy reaches the sling first with stacy right behind her
even here the vine continues to attack them whipping and hissing and laughing
amy holds the sling toward stacy
but stacy is too hysterical she just stands there sobbing screaming
jeffs voice comes toward them from above amoy
amy pulls the sling over her own head
yells pull us up
did you find it
she reaches out grabs stacy wrapping her arms and legs around her
stacy returns the embrace both of them clutching at each other as the windlass finally begins to creak lifting the two of them into the air
the vines hanging from the shafts walls whip at the girls as they rise coiling around their bodies pulling at them that strange laughter growing ever louder seeming to buffet
stacy and amy grip each other with all their strength eyes shut tight
the scream comes faintly toward us
the mayans are arrayed about their campsite all of them motionless silent staring up the hill with their impassive expressions
the weather has shifted a wind has risen
the sun is setting a red smudge behind a dark gray wall of clouds
on his backboard unconscious his breathing coming in that ragged rasp a thread of brown liquid leaking from the corner of his mouth
amy is crouched beside him she leans forward wipes away the liquid
stacy sits in the clearing behind her leaning against eric
theyre both slick with sweat but stacy keeps shivering as if cold
erics arms are around her and her eyes are shut
jeff is peeling the orange
like amy hes still spattered and stained with mathiass blood
the vine has continued to grow on everyones clothes weblike eating away at the fabric
jeff reaches tugs free a strand of it and a six inch tear appears in his t shirt
stacy opens her eyes she leans forward peers down at the wounds on her leg her right hand moving to her chest probing at her rib cage
she turns to eric check your phone
eric pushes himself to his feet steps toward his pack
he pulls out his phone flips it open
he shakes his head
stacy contd let me see
eric carries the phone to her then stands over her while she opens it stares down at it
she shuts it opens it again
then again and again and suddenly shes crying bent into herself
eric drops to a crouch rests his hand on her knee
but her crying increases she begins to sob
jeff is bent over the orange dividing it into four equal piles its peel too concentrating
he lifts his head stares
amy stands up hurries over
kneels in front of stacy takes her hand
its okay sweetie
stacy keeps weeping uncontrollably shaking her head
i wanner go home
i wanna leave
shes wailing rocking back and forth she cant seem to stop
amy struggles to calm her
stacy keeps wailing rocking eyes shut
amy leans in close
amy contd lets play the game
can you do that
can you give me a so
stacy continues to cry
amy contd come on
can you try
a beat so there was this girl who wanted to be a pilot
stacys tears keep coming
amy looks at eric gives him a nod prodding him into speech
he hesitates then but she was scared of heights
so she became a lifeguard instead
she squeezes stacys come on
amy glances across the clearing at jeff wanting him to join in too
it seems as if he might refuse but then her look hardens and he relents
but she couldnt swim
so she wore a life vest
she squeezes stacys hand come on
a beat then stacy takes a deep ragged breath
she wipes at her face struggles for words
she trails off crying again
amy nods encouraging her
they laughed at her
so she very suddenly it starts to rain a dozen large heavy drops
they all glance skyward
he springs to his feet
and then a downpour a deluge as if a trap door has swung open in the clouds
the rain falls in a loud drumming rush turning the clearing to mud
eric jumps up too
he and jeff start digging through the backpacks from the
blue tent searching for something anything in which to catch the water
they find a small plastic bag a nylon toiletry kit a frisbee
jeff sets these in a row on the ground open to the rain
eric rushes to the orange tent vanishes inside
amy tilts back her head tries to catch the rain in her open mouth
stacy just sits there hugging herself shivering still half crying
theyre all drenched back spattered with mud
and then as abruptly as it had begun the rain starts to slacken
eric reemerges from the orange tent carrying a thermos a plastic cup
he sets them next to the other containers but its pointless the rain is already stopping
they all stare at these meager receptacles theyve managed to catch less than half an inch of muddy looking water
groans hes furious with himself
jeff contd we shouldve been ready
we he kicks the frisbee across the clearing
amy jumps up
she steps forward as if to guard the other containers
it doesnt fucking matter
there was water in it
he spins toward her turning his fury with himself on her how much amy
two and a half gallons
cause thats what we need
for today just to make it through today
and then tomorrow the same all over again
and for how long
another week before our parents start searching
and then what
how long till they track us to coba
or to this fucking hill
how long will it take amy
you said its not gonna happen
were not gonna make it
the others stare at him in astonishment too stunned to speak
he gives them all a look of disgust jeff contd and youre fucking playing games
mimicking amys voice so there were these people trapped in the jungle
but they didnt have any water
amy looks as if she might start crying
so theyre gonna die of thirst
amy covers her ears with her hands
but this fucking vine might kill them first
jeff paces away struggling to regain control of himself
a long beat and then very quietly im sorry
he steps back toward the dismembered orange crouches over it
the fruit and peels are muddy now spoiled looking
he waves for the others to approach
jeff contd come on
we need to eat
no one moves
theyre all staring at him with their shocked expressions
he cant seem to meet their eyes
he gestures at the orange again
jeff contd the peel too
abeat then the others step forward to claim their portions first eric then stacy then amy
they eat without speaking
finally almost as if talking to himself jeff contd itll rain again
it has to
and well figure out a way to catch it
he nods to himself well be fine
well ration the food
and then you know well just
well tough it out
jeff contd people have survived for weeks with nothing
just water a little bit of water
so why not us
no one responds
they continue to eat the fruit the peels
their torn clothes cling wetly to them
jeff uncaps the water bottle offers it to amy
she drinks passes it on
it moves around the circle back to jeff
what about the vine
jeff takes his sip caps the bottle
hes reclaiming himself his voice strengthening his confidence returning
i dont think it can hurt us
if it could it already wouldve wouldnt it
why would it wait
the others are silent considering this
then jeff contd its not strong enough to overpower us
and it mathias gasps suddenly his entire body spasming for a moment before the watery rasp of his breathing resumes
he doesnt regain consciousness his eyes remain shut
everyone watches him for a beat he also is spattered with mud
hes gonna die isnt he
if theres no phone then theres no me too
they all turn to look at her
shes massaging that spot on her rib cage again digging into it with her fingers
stacy contd its eating me
just like him
she waves toward the shaft
jeff gives her a weary look
she jumps up begins to pace agitated
its inside me
in my leg
i can feel it
she stops pacing lifts her shirt
she points to the base of her rib cage
stacy contd see
jeff stares theres nothing there
he shakes his head
the knife is lying in the mud beside him and stacy steps forward snatches it up
jeff reaches to stop her but hes too slow
she stands before him hefting it
in her hand
put it down
ill show you
she lifts her
shirt again pressing at her rib cage with her fingertips
jeff stands up holds out his hand
give it to me
amy and eric stand too
but shes already cutting a four inch slit along the base of her rib cage
a horizontal line of blood crests the wound sweeps down across stacys stomach soaking into the waistband of her shorts
she watches it frowning
i thought it would just come tumbling out
she probes at the cut with the point of the knife prying it farther open the bleeding increasing
jeff reaches grabs the knife from her
he looks furious sit down
its right she pokes her finger into the wound digging
jeff slaps her hand away
a il hi f down i he shoves her down onto her back then picks up the towel hed used to hold the heated stone
he balls it up presses it to stacys wound
eric retrieves the bottle of tequila from the mud uncaps it
he crouches beside stacy
shes just scared
whatre you doing
hes lifting the bottle toward stacys mouth but he hesitates now turning toward jeff
just a sip
to calm her
itll dehydrate her
a sip jeff
he starts to lift the bottle again
jeff shoves it aside
i said q
leave him alone
she tries to sit up but jeff pushes her back down hard
you realize how stupid youre being
sticking that dirty knife its growing
youre imagining it and you just im gonna end up like her
r get infected
youre gonna get yourself killed
youre not listening
shouting very loud a beat of startled silence and then her voice comes again from across the hilltop sounding exactly like her only slightly fuzzed a rasping quality just beneath
the words they all turn to look but theres nothing there just the vine its green leaves its bright red flowers
stacys voice comes once more from the
opposite direction now stacys voice contd what the stacys voice keeps coming switching locations seeming to float across the hilltop they turn tracking it
amy steps toward jeff looking frightened
shaking his head no its the vine
its mimicking her
stacy has started to cry she covers her ears with her hands
make it stop
make it stop
stacy tries to sit up but jeff pushes her back down
ses still crouched over her pressing the towel to her wound its completely soaked through with blood now
stacy yells shut up
stacys voice continues but now that high pitched laughter is coming too a chorus of it growing in volume stacys weeping has deepened to sobs
she keeps yelling shut up
the laughter grows steadily louder obscuring stacys voice we see the flowers trembling visibly vibrating as they sculpt the sound
the light is fading fast
one of the mayan women is cleaning a pot with a handful of leaves
three of the men sit facing the hillside their bows in their laps
the others are bedding down beneath the trees
the laughter echoes down the hill eerie and ghoulish yet the mayans betray no reaction to it as if it were no more worthy of note to them than the
steady rasping of the locusts in the jungle at their backs
jeff stacy and amy lie side by side in the darkness
the liquid rattle of mathiass breathing comes from the clearing sounding as if someone were sawing at a tin can
jeff and stacy are asleep amy is stirring restlessly shifting first onto one side then the other
finally she rises moves toward the flap slips quietly through it
the moon is out dropping its faint light upon us
mathias is on his backboard beneath the little lean to more audible than visible with his phlegm clotted breathing
eric is beside him
he looks up as amy emerges from the tent
now is he
eric shrugs waves toward the backboard it seems clear enough
amy stares for a moment then sits beside him
amy contd you can go lie down if you want
eric lifts his hand pushes a button on his watch makes it glow
he squints at it
i still have forty minutes
i dont mind
i cant sleep
eric checks his watch again its glow briefly illuminating his face
he gestures toward the tent
they both are
theres a slight breeze and the tent makes a flapping sound in it
they both turn to stare at it
then amy contd do you think its inside her
he shakes his head jeff cut it out
i saw him
but she says she can feel it
eric waves this aside
you know how stacy is
shes just scared
she gets things in her head and mathias makes a retching sound loud wet painful and they both turn apeering at his gaunt form through the darkness
he falls quiet his eyes dont open
a beat then eric contd ive been sitting here you know making all these deals in my head with god
you ever do that
amy just stares at him
he has his arms wrapped around his knees hugging them to his chest
eric contd like i say okay you can fire me on the first day teaching if thats what you want just let us make it home
but that doesnt mean shit cause i dont even really want the job and he has to know that doesnt he
so i say all right stacy can leave me you know or even i dont know ill give up a finger okay
or two fingers
or fuck it take a hand take my left hand but let us just get home all of us
a beat and then i look at him he nods toward mathias and i cant help it im like take him if you need to take mathias and let the
rest of us go
thats fucking horrible isnt it
and once ive said it i feel like i cant take it back you know
eric contd like the words have gone up into the sky and gods sort of thinking about them now making his choice and if mathias dies and we dont itll
like i killed him wont it
like i amy starts to cry she covers her mouth with her hand
eric stares at her in surprise
eric contd what
what is it
amy shakes her head
she struggles to stop but she cant
im so sorry
a beat its my fault
if i hadnt stepped onto the hill her crying increases
eric leans touches her hand
thats stupid amy
thats jeff said it
he said eric reaches puts his arm around her trying to quiet her
he didnt mean it
theres no way
he was just we might not have
she rests her head on his shoulder weeping her body shaking with it while he pats her stroking her hair
stacy and jeff eyes shut sleeping
very softly there comes a faint panting rhythmic furtive sounding
stacys eyes open she lies there listening
theres a moan and the panting quickens
stacy rises to a sitting position
she listens for another beat then leans prods at jeff
he awakes with a jerk blinking up at her
stacy holds her finger to her lips silencing him
from outside theres another moan
jeff sits up listening
the panting is building toward a climax
jeff leans toward the pile of supplies at the tents rear squinting at the tangle of vine growing across it
he points whispering jeff contd its the but stacy is already pushing herself to her feet
she moves quickly to the tents flap unzips it crouches out into mathiass breathing continues its ragged course
amy is still leaning into eric her head on his shoulder
he has his arm around her
he looks up blinking as stacy emerges from the tent into the moonlight
what the fuck eric
amy lifts her head wipes at her face eric drops his arm from her shoulder
they both stare at stacy startled by her anger
jeff appears behind her stepping through the flap
we heard you
heard me what
eric looks from stacy to jeff completely perplexed
whatre you talking about
it made it sound as if you two stacy turns toward him snorting shaking her head
youre so blind
i could hear it
at the back of the tent
it was it doesnt make things up
it mimics things
things its heard
then its heard someone having sex at some point
slowly quietly a tendril has begun to slither forward through the darkness creeping in beneath the lean to snaking toward mathias toward his head
jeff and the others are all too focused on one another to notice
that was ay jeff
jeff reaches touches stacys arm struggling to calm her but she flinches from him
its doing this on purpose
cant you see
it thinks youre the weakest because youre hurt
so its trying to upset you
trying youre not upset
he had his arm around her
he amy leans forward hands out beseeching
nothing happened stacy
i was crying
and eric we he ar you
the vine starts to push its way in between mathiass lips into his mouth
mathias makes a gagging sound but doesnt regain consciousness once more no one notices
we heard the vine
it youre such a fool jeff
you think shes never cheated on you
perfect little angelic amy
i could tell you secrets
i could open your eyes
shi i up
a second tendril has slithered under the lean to
it covers mathiass nose drawing itself tight
the steady rasping of his breathing is cut off
yet again no one notices
you stupid cunt
stacy spins on her venomous fuck you
back to jeff twice jeff
two different guys
and one of them jeff grabs her arm grips it silencing hers enough stacy
stacy falls silent she seems as astonished by what shes said as everyone else
jeff contd where do you think you are
why would you even care at this point if they were out here fucking
we dont have any food
and he turns stares sees
he darts forward starts to yank away the tendrils
they resist him writhing clinging to mathiass face
eric and amy both jump up
stacy has started to cry shaking her head mortified oh god
oh please no
jeff bends close to mathiass face listening he checks mathiass neck for a pulse
a beat then he turns toward the others shakes his head
stacy begins to sob stacy contd im sorry
im so sorry
eric reaches takes her into his arms hugging her
the hillside falls away from us the narrow trail winding down its face to the clearing and the wall of jungle beyond
the sun is just rising and the vine seems to shimmer in it
three of the mayan encampments are visible from here one directly beneath us one to the left another to the right
thin ribbons of smoke rise from their campfires
jeff stands there staring down toward the jungle
eric and stacy are sitting together in the clearing behind him holding hands stacy is still crying softly
amy approaches across the hilltop stops beside jeff
they mustve salted the soil
thats the only way i can think
he turns glances at amy
she has no idea what hes talking about
he waves down toward the mayans
jeff contd to keep the ground clear
it grows so quickly
he gestures at their clothes upon which that green webbing of vine continues to spread eating away at the fabric
jeff contd its old too has to be
because the birds the insects
somehow theyve evolved
theyve learned not to land here
he peers about them at the vine covered hill and the horses
how frightened they were
they knew too
they stand in silence for a beat staring down the hill toward the mayans
then amy reaches touches jeffs arm
it didnt happen
jeff turns stares at her
she waves back toward the tent
amy contd eric and i we were just i know
and what she said
about spring break
i jeff reaches presses his finger to her lips
amy falls silent watching him
he lowers his finger
jeff contd have you made it up with her
amy half nods half shrugs
jeff contd good
but i want to tell you
he presses his finger to her lips again stopping her
he waits a beat and then i wish it mattered
amy gives him a confused look
jeff throws out his hand
gesturing at the hilltop the vine their tattered clothes
jeff contd look at us
a beat would it matter to you
amy hesitates considering
then she shakes her head
and with that jeff turns starts back toward the orange tent
we hear a zipping sound which carries over into jeff is crouched beside the backboard unzipping the sleeping bag
eric tosses the flimsy lean to aside exposing mathiass corpse to the sun
amy and stacy stand watching
eric considers this staring down at mathiass body
mathiass face is burned red from the vines sap his legs are two blackened stumps
youll have to lift him
eric hesitates he seems reluctant to touch the corpse
finally he girds himself straddles the backboard grabs mathias under his armpits lifting him
jeff leans forward starts to pull the sleeping bag over mathiass head
the corpse seems intent upon resisting them its arms keep getting tangled catching and snagging
jeff and eric have to wrestle with it both of them panting sweating before they manage to shove it into the bag
jeff zips the bag shut and they stand over it catching their breath wiping the perspiration from their faces
should we say something
jeff gives him a blank stare
eric contd like you know
jeff frowns down at the bag searching for words
before he can find them stacy speaks wheres the knife
they all turn
her hand is under her tattered shirt pressing at her lower back
jeff sighs she lifts her shirt twisting to show him
it looks as if a large starfish has been implanted just beneath her skin
its moving too inching slowly but visibly downward
they all stare in astonishment
amy gasps points at stacys leg
stacy bends to see theres more vine here a snakelike lump winding its way upward from the top of her shin to her inner thigh
another small pile of clothes burning with that blue alcohol fueled flame
can i give her some
the knife is placed in the fire and we pull back to reveal amy holds up the bottle of tequila
jeff is crouching over the fire heating the knifes blade
be glances toward her nods
stacy is sitting down staring at the bulge in her leg with a dazed expression
eric is beside her
amy offers the bottle to stacy they all watch as she takes a long swallow
then she hands the bottle back to amy and jeff pulls the knife from the fire carries it toward her
he gestures to eric and amy
hold her hands
they each take one of her hands
jeff crouches over her leg
jeff contd you might want to shut your eyes
stacy shakes her head
i want to see
jeff hesitates for a moment it seems as if he might argue
but then very quickly he leans forward and draws the knife in one smooth movement up and around stacys leg
stacy moans her body tensing but she doesnt cry out
the incision reveals the vine a foot long its leaves and flowers clotted with stacys blood which is oozing from the wound
jeff reaches in pries the tendril from her flesh
stacy moans again arching backward as the vine emerges writhing and twisting
the blood comes more thickly now pumping from the wound running down her leg
jeff drops the tendril into the dirt steps on it grinding it into stillness
stacy is breathing hard almost hyperventilating
shes shut her eyes
should i stop
stacy shakes her head vehemently
jeff glances at the others
eric shakes his head too
amys eyes like stacys are tightly shut
jeff contd youll have to roll over
stacy lets go of the others hands rolls onto her stomach
she hitches up her shirt revealing the small of her back the starfish shaped bulge
jeff crouches at her side
jeff contd ready
she nods and he leans makes five quick incisions in the shape of an asterisk directly above the bulge
stacys body goes rigid and eric takes her hand again
once more we can see the tendril through the incision dark with her blood
jeff reaches in and slowly pulls the vine from her body
theres an astonishing amount of it he has to drop the knife and use both hands to drag the slimy mass free
as the plant emerges from her body thrashing coiling and uncoiling covered in half clotted blood like a newborn stacy starts to scream
the mayans at their campsite three of them on guard duty the others napping in the shade beneath the trees
stacys screaming echoes down the hill toward us
theyve pulled a shirt from one of the backpacks torn it into strips and used these to bandage stacys wounds tying them around her leg and torso
shes lying on her side eyes shut her head in erics lap
hes stroking her hair
jeff is counting the grapes into four separate piles
amy sits watching him
when he finishes he gestures for her to take a pile
then he scoops stacy and erics rations up carries them over
can you eat
stacy sits up wincing her bandages are soaked through with blood
she takes the grapes from him eric does too
they all begin to eat in silence
when theyre done jeff passes the water bottle around their circle
then jeff contd we should try to rest i guess
he waves toward the tent get out of the sun
were losing moisture out theres more of it
she leans forward probes at her right thigh prodding the skin
the others watch her theres no bulge visible no sign of the vine at all
eric gives her a pained look
theres nothing there stacy
its under the muscle
down by the bone
she keeps pushing at her leg
she glances from eric to amy to jeff
no one says anything
stacy contd cut me and see
she uses her finger to draw a line up her thigh
youre losing too much blood
and if any of these get infected my calf too
she lifts her right leg turning it to show the others
jeff bends to look
again theres no visible sign of the vine
he shakes his head
no more cutting
not unless the knife is in the dirt beside him and stacy leans forward tries to grab it
jeff is too quick for her though he snatches it up tucks it into his belt
stacy is becoming more and more upset
she holds out her hands begging please jeff
you cant keep stacy is starting to cry her mouth is trembling
shes prodding at her body her legs her chest and stomach
amy scoots toward her grasps her hand
stacy yanks her hand free clutches her scalp weeping its in my head
i can feel it in my head
amy takes stacy in her arms hugging her tight
stacy sobs into amys shoulder her body jumping
amy strokes her
eric steps across the clearing picks up the bottle of tequila
he glances at jeff and jeff nods
amy contd youre scared honey
youre just scared
stacy nods shes still crying but its growing quieter
eric crouches beside her holds out the bottle of tequila
stacy just stares at it
amy encourages her amy contd itll help
stacy accepts the bottle takes a long swallow
the others watch her in silence
finally amy contd can you rest some
in the tent
stacy is silent
she wipes the tears from her face
that girl she waves at the shaft i keep seeing her
when i shut my eyes
she stands up holds out her hand lets just lie down for a bit
stacy hesitates staring up at amy
then she reaches grasps her hand
amy pulls her to her feet helps her hobble across the clearing to the tent
jeff and eric sit there watching in silence as they vanish through the flap
sunlight filters through the orange nylon all four of them lie sleeping in a row sweating
the vine has shredded their clothes to tatters they look like castaways
the tents flap hangs open billowing gently in a slight breeze
stacy open her eyes
she lies there staring up toward the orange nylon above her
the blood on her bandages has dried to a dark red bordering on black
she sits up stares about the tent
eric is on one side of her then amy then jeff
jeff is on his back the knife still tucked into his belt
stacy rises quietly steps over amy crouches above him staring down at the knife
she reaches tries to slip it free but then jerks back when jeff shifts in his sleep
she hesitates watching him
she seems as if shes about to try again but then the tent flap billows in the breeze drawing her gaze
a beat and she rises steps carefully over jeff ducks outside into the clearing
stacy stands just beyond the tents
all is still quiet
she moves to erics pack crouches over it pulls out his phone
she flips it open stares down at its screen theres still no signal
she drops it back into the pack
she turns to examine the clearing her eyes falling upon the two backpacks from the blue tent
their pockets are zippered open jeff and erics hurried pillaging during the downpour has scattered their contents across the dirt
stacy rises steps toward this tangled mound
she starts to dig through it casually at first but then with growing intensity throwing t shirts and jeans and shorts aside probing deeply into the pile
suddenly she goes still
amid the sodden mass of clothing sits a knife in a small scabbard
as stacy crouches there the vines start to rustle a rippling motion passing across them as
if a wind were sweeping the hillside
stacy watches with a look of horror it looks like the pelt of some giant animal shaking itself
when it finally stops she bends reaching for the knife
jeff eric and amy still sleeping
the tents flap continues to billow in the breeze
very faintly from the clearing we hear a moan
then the sound of whimpering
eric opens his eyes listening
an instant later very abruptly there comes a sharp rending scream of pure pain
eric jumps up starts for the flap jeff is right behind him
eric emerges from the tent then jeff then amy
they stand there staring too horrified to move
oh my god
stacy is on the far side of the clearing
shes pulled off her shirt her shorts and has cut much of the skin from her body
she doesnt notice them
shes bent over slicing into her left thigh peeling the skin back from the muscle
she turns blood streaked wild eyed the knife in her hand her skin is hanging from her in shreds
we can see her leg muscles her abdominals a glint of bone at her left elbow
jeff starts forward holding out his hand very stern give it
eric follows him
amy stays by the tent shes begun to cry
just stacy shakes her head shes crying too her whole body shaking
her hair is matted with blood she looks terrified
i have to get it out
its jeff darts forward tries to grab the knife from her and she slashes at him shouting stacy coatd leave me alonel the blade slices into his palm
jeff jumps back cradling his hand at his chest
stacy contd i have to eric steps toward her from behind reaching around her body for the knife and she spins reflexively trying to fend him off
but the knife is in her hand and it punches into his chest just to the right of his sternum sticking there
eric looks at the knife in surprise
its twitching back and forth with the beating of his heart
he starts to reach for it but then his legs give out
he collapses dropping to the dirt which has grown muddy with stacys blood
stacys crying deepens she takes a step toward eric but then her own body fails her
she falls to her knees in the bloody puddle reaching toward him
stacy contd oh no
im eric is on his back he struggles up onto one elbow
he tries to speak but only a gagging sound emerges blood frothing at his mouth
its pumping thickly from his wound too saturating his shirt
stacy contd i didnt
eric drops back again
he struggles raggedly for breath
jeff lowers himself to his knees beside him hesitating impotently over him uncertain what to do
stacy is sobbing shaking her head
theres blood everywhere
stacy contd kill me
jeff turns stares at her
amy steps forward crouches beside her
she takes stacys hand
it hurts so much
eric tries to rise again
the blood surges from his wound when he moves
jeff presses him back down
try to stacy clutches at amy begging her voice hoarse with pain
i cant she stops in mid sentence staring
jeff and amy follow her gaze
a half dozen tendrils are snaking into the clearing reaching toward erics body
jeff jumps to his feet
the tendrils begin to wrap themselves around erics limbs and jeff bends to tear them away
more and more keep coming though
eric has started to convulse gagging his head cocked back
jeff keeps yanking the tendrils away but there are far too many of them they coil around erics legs pulling at him
the blood has stopped pumping from his wound his body has gone still
jeff i she points toward the tent
jeff turns to see
the sleeping bag in which theyd enshrouded mathias is moving hes thrashing about within it struggling to sit up
and hes shouting too his voice muffled by the bag he seems to be tearing at the bag with his arms
jeff hesitates just for an instant staring in astonishment then hes sprinting across the clearing
he bends struggles for the zipper
im right here
im he unzips the bag and an immense tangle of vine cascades out onto the dirt
its flowers are a pale pink theyre opening and closing still calling louder now the thick clot of tendrils writhes spasmodically coiling and uncoiling
entwined within it are mathiass bones already stripped clean of flesh
the vine falls silent
a beat then it starts to laugh a low mocking chuckle
on the opposite side of the little clearing stacy begins to scream shaking her head sobbing
jeff stands there perfectly still
amy is holding stacy struggling unsuccessfully to quiet her shh
the vines laughter grows steadily
louder punctuated by stacys shouts amy turns stares at jeff
blood is running off stacys body in strings
the vine has dragged eric to the edge of the clearing only his head and torso are still visible
jeff strides toward him
stacy contd jeff bends yanks the knife from erics chest
then he starts across the clearing toward stacy
the mayans in their campsite
theyre all staring up the hill listening
stacys voice echoes toward us and then abruptly it goes silent
amy sits beside stacy who lies on her back in the puddle of blood arms thrown out the knife stuck hilt deep in her chest
erics body is barely visible at the edge of the clearing the vine rustles softly as it consumes him
jeff is pulling their remaining supplies from his knapsack the bananas the raisins the pretzels the protein bars the nuts the water iced tea and coke
he has a bloody strip of fabric tied around the wound on his hand
amy watches as he arranges the food in front of her
shes crying silently tears running down her dirt smeared cheeks
jeff peels one of the bananas its dark brown far too ripe
he holds it out to her
she just stares at it
youll need the energy
he reaches for her hand puts the banana in it
she holds the fruit but makes no move to eat
finally very quietly i still think we should wait
jeff sighs its clear theyve already been through this
youll only get weaker
theyll come looking
you said nobodys coming
our parents all theyll find are our bones
amy is silent staring down at the banana
jeff contd we dont have time for this amy
youll need as much daylight as possible
he waves upward toward the sun which has passed its peak begun its slow slide westward
amy squints toward it for a beat and then almost despite herself lifts the banana to her mouth
she bites chews swallows still mutely crying
jeff peels the second banana he hands it to her as soon as she finishes the first
be watches her eat
hes tearing open the bag of pretzels when another tendril snakes into the clearing
they both watch it neither of them moving
its joined by a second tendril then a third a fourth
the vines coil around stacys body begin to drag it from the clearing
amys crying grows more forceful her body shaking
jeff contd shh
jeff reaches strokes her
the vine pulls stacys body into itself burying it
amy watches struggling to control
her voice emerges as little more than a whisper i dont want to
she shakes her head wipes at her face the tears the snot the sweat the dirt
her clothes are falling off her body eaten to shreds
amy contd why cant we both
jeff hesitates a
then clearly not believing it we might
he hands her the pretzels she takes them watching his face
itll take them a moment to react
if i can make it to the trees
he trails off shrugs
amy keeps staring at him she doesnt believe this either
he sighs again holds up his hand pulls the bandage from his wound its three inches long a deep gash into his palm
jeff contd how long till its inside me
amy is silent
he flexes his hand and the wound opens mouthlike blood oozing thickly from it
jeff contd it already is probably
ill be just like stacy soon
he turns glances toward the spot where her body has disappeared
amy looks too
jeff contd then what
you all alone on this hill
you know how that would end dont you
once more amy is silent
he waves for her to keep eating and she starts in on the pretzels mechanically
he opens the can of coke hands it to her she takes a long sip
jeff contd once youre in the jungle you drop and hide
another tendril slithers forward
it slips into the immense puddle of blood beside jeff and amy begins to drink it
jeff contd theyll never find you its too thick in there
just burrow down and theyll run right past
jeff opens the can of nuts sets it in front of amy
then he gets up crouches over the puddle of blood
his hands dips them into the puddle
he steps toward amy smears the blood across her t shirt
amy keeps eating
jeff contd its sudden movements thatll get you caught
so take your time
you step then listen
then another step and listen again
he moves back to the puddle which the lone tendril continues to drain
he cups his hands scoops up more blood smears it on her tattered khakis
amy has finished the pretzels she reaches for the nuts looking numb
jeff contd east always east keep the sun at your back
he scoops up more blood from the puddle
jeff contd arms
amy holds out her arms and he smears the blood on them
jeff contd youll hear me yell
ill yell your name
he returns yet again to the puddle then stands over her the blood cupped in his hands dripping
jeff contd and you cant hesitate
not for an instant
amy nods and he uncups his hands over her head
she shuts her eyes as the blood runs into her hair down her forehead her neck her face
three of the mayan men as usual sit in the clearing bows in their laps facing the hill
the others are sheltering from the sun in the line of shade along the jungles margin some sleeping some talking quietly together
one of the men in the clearing suddenly rises to his feet nocking an arrow
the other two also rise
the mayans along the clearing fall silent staring up the hill
jeff is approaching down the trail carrying amy pieta like in his arms
her body is limp apparently lifeless and dripping with blood
the bald mayan emerges from the tree line followed by yet another man with a bow
they join the other three mayans in the center of the clearing
they all watch as jeff reaches the base of the trail where he carefully lays amy down
jeff crouches over amy laying her arms across her chest pushing the hair from her face
he bends kisses her blood smeared forehead
then he glances up at the mayans
you dont even know her name
the mayans just stare at him
he rises to his feet pulling the knife from his belt its darkly stained with
jeff contd you should
you should know who youre killing
he steps out into the clearing
the bald mayan pulls his pistol from its holster raises it aiming at jeffs chest
the others draw their bows
jeff smiles taps his sternum
jeff contd jeff
my names jeff
he edges along the clearings margin keeping close to the vines moving away from amys body
the mayans follow him weapons raised
after a handful of steps he stops again turns toward them
jeff contd can you say it
again the mayans just stare
he slaps at his chest
jeff contd jeff
a beat then he suddenly yells waving the knife at the men
jeff contd silence
the mayans stand there with their weapons raised waiting to see what he might do
a beat then he starts walking once more along the clearings edge away from amy
another ten yards and he stops again waves up the hill
jeff contd theres stacy too
youve killed them all
he steps toward them
the bald man raises his hand holds it up palm out next to his pistol
jeff smiles at him again
jeff contd but not everyone
he laughs a little wildly and shakes his head
jeff contd look at you you stupid fucks
you have no idea what im saying do you
he takes another step into the clearing
the bald man cocks his pistol loudly
several of the other mayans have emerged from the jungle they stand there watching
jeff contd one of us is gonna survive
you should know that name too
he takes yet another step forward
the bald man speaks a string of words in mayan with an edge of warning
more mayans emerge from the jungle shielding their eyes against the sun staring
no one is looking in amys direction
jeff contd its not jeff
he shakes his head his voice dropping almost to a whisper jeff
contd its not me
he takes another step
and then still quietly jeff contd its amy
he takes a deep breath gathering himself
then he yells jeff contd and starts to run straight at the mayans
he only manages three steps before the bald man fires his pistol and the others let their arrows fly
the bullet hits jeff in the chest just beneath his throat
one of the arrows misses the other three strike his stomach his left arm his right thigh
before he even hits the ground theres a shout from the mayans along the treeline
the bald man turns
amy is on her feet sprinting for the jungle
the bald man raises
his pistol fires but the shot is too hurried it goes wide
the others are still scrambling for fresh arrows as she vanishes into the trees
the bowmen sprint after her disappearing into the jungle leaving the bald man alone in the clearing with jeff
the mayan women stand motionless along the treeline staring
after amy they look mortified grief stricken
jeff is bleeding heavily from his wounds struggling to crawl forward his breath frothing pinkly at his lips
a half dozen tendrils slither into the clearing
they coil around his legs start to drag him back toward the hill
jeff fights them kicking moaning bleeding
the bald man watches
he too looks grief stricken
he steps forward aims at jeffs head
as he fires we we hear footsteps moving quickly down a tiled floor
a slight spanish accent she flagged down a tour bus just west of coba the voice carries over into a mexican doctor in his late fifties balding a little stooped
his white jacket buttoned over a shirt and tie is hurrying down the corridor accompanied by teresa a dark haired woman in beige slacks a blue blouse
teresa has a leather briefcase a blackberry on her belt
shes holding amys passport
which she examines as they walk
its smeared with dried blood
and collapsed before the driver even managed to open the door
the corridor is brightly lit very clean
rooms open off it on either side and we glimpse the still
forms of sleeping patients as we pass ivs hanging from metal stands beside their beds
its very quiet
doctor contd she revived briefly just after they brought her in
she was in bad shape severely dehydrated traumatized in shock
and terribly frightened
it was impossible to make any sense of what she was saying
she was sobbing hysterical
we had to sedate her
the doctor has a manila folder under his arm he opens it pulls out a piece of paper a color printout of a digital photo
he hands it to teresa
doctor contd her clothes were torn she was covered in blood
but not her own
teresa stares down at the photo it shows amy on a gurney unconscious blood smeared corpse like
now do you know
she has no wounds
a uniformed policeman sits on a chair outside one of the rooms at the end of the corridor reading a newspaper
he rises as they approach
teresa hands the printout back to the doctor she keeps the passport
thats all you have
im afraid so
be nods to the policeman and leads teresa into a bed a night stand a curtained window
amy lies with a sheet pulled to her chin unconscious an iv dripping into her arm
theyve cleaned the blood off her
a nurse sits in a chair beside the bed
shes in her early twenties with long dark hair tied in a bun
she stands up stepping back from the bed as the doctor and teresa enter
the doctor addresses her in subtitled spanish has she stirred
the nurse shakes her head
the doctor moves to the bed
he takes amys wrist feeling for her pulse
amys eyes open at his touch
she stares at him her arm hanging limply in his grasp
he smiles down at her
doctor contd there you are
teresa steps forward and amys gaze shifts to her
doctor contd my name is dr
amys eyes return to the doctor
they fall on his face then drift down to his chest
the doctor gestures toward teresa
doctor contd and this is ms
bern from the u
amy is staring at his white coat her expression going slack almost catatonic all the life draining from it
doctor contd we were hoping you might be able to shed a little light on what youve been through
amy is silent still staring with that dead look in her eyes at the doctors coat a faint green web of vine has taken root there spreading across the white
