the sixth sense by m
night shyamalan t h e s i x t h s e n s e written by m
night shyamalan a naked lightbulb sparks to life
it dangles from the ceiling of a basement
light quick footsteps as anna crowe moves down the stairs
anna is the rare combination of beauty and innocence
she stands in the chilly basement in an elegant summer dress that outlines her slender body
her gentle eyes move across the empty room and come to rest on a rack of wine bottles covering one entire wall
she walks to the bottles
her fingertips slide over the labels
she stops when she finds just the right one
a tiny smile as she slides it out
anna turns to leave
she stares at the shadowy basement
its an unsettling place
she stands very still and watches her breath form a tiny cloud in the cold air
shes visibly uncomfortable
anna crowe moves for the staircase in a hurry
each step faster than the next
she climbs out of the basement in another burst of light quick footsteps
two place settings are arranged on the living room coffee table
take out chinese food sits half eaten on good china
an empty bottle of red wine sits between boxes of chinese food
anna arrives with the backup bottle and is now wearing a sweater
she hands a collegiate rowing team sweatshirt to malcolm
its getting cold
malcolm crowe sits on the floor at the coffee table his vest and tie on the sofa behind him
a jacket and an overcoat lay on a brirfcase next to him
malcolm is in his thirties with thick wavy hair and striking intelligent eyes that squint from years of intense study
his charming easy going smile spreads across his face
thats one fine frame
a fine frame it is
malcolm points to the huge framed certificate propped up on a dining room chair
its printed on aged parchment type paper
the frame is a polished mahogany
he slips on the sweatshirt
how much does a fine frame like that cost you think
anna hands the backup bottle over to malcolm
smiling ive never told you
but you sound a little like dr
seuss when youre drunk
malcolm uncorks the wine and starts pouring in the empty glass
anna im serious
serious i am anna
shes clearly buzzed herself
malcolm doesnt get it
anna takes a few calming sips of her wine
her attention slowly moves to the framed certificate
id say that cost at least a couple hundred
we should hock it
buy a c
rack for the bedroom
do you know how important this is
this is big time
beat im going to read it for you doctor
do i really sound like dr
anna ignores malcolm and clears her throat
she leans forward her seat and reads the certificate out loud as malcolm tries to tickle her
in recognition for his outstanding achievement in the field of child psychology his dedication to his work and his continuing efforts to improve the quality of life for countless children
and their families the city of philadelphia proudly bestows upon its son dr
the mayors citation for professional excellence
the power of the words sobers the two of them
they called you their son
we can keep it in the bathroom
anna turns to malcolm
its not real anna
some secretary wrote that up
dont tell me you thought it was real
annas expression becomes serious
she just keeps staring
dont do the quiet thing
you know i hate it
this is an important night for us
finally someone is recognizing the sacrifices you made
that you have put everything second including me for those families theyre talking about
malcolm plays softly with her face
anna takes his hands and holds them steady
theyre also saying that my husband has a gift
not an ordinary gift that allows him to hit a ball over a fence
or a gift that lets him produce beautiful images on a canvas
your gift teaches children how to be strong in situations where most adults would piss on themselves
beat yes i believe what they wrote about you
anna lets go of his hands
annas eyes are emotional
malcolm smiles softly
anna leans towards him
they hold each other tight
what are we hugging about again
anna laughs as she wipes her eyes
there wasnt supposed to be any crying at this celebration
just a lot of drinking and sex
malcolms charming easy going smile returns
i would like some red wine in a glass
anna hands him his glass
he stares at it
i would not like it in a mug
i would not like it in a jug
malcolm looks at anna surprised at what he said
they crack up laughing
their sweet laughter fills the house
two giggling shadows appear in the bedroom doorway
they try to turn on the light
it doesnt come on
anna giggles some more as malcolms shadow stumbles across the bedroom
a shaft of light falls on anna as she stands in the corner of the room
anna smiles playfully and pulls off her sweater
she sways to a pretend striptease song
malcolm cant hold back his grin
he joins in slowly peeling off the sweat shirt
he looks back to anna
shes stopped her playful dance
shes facing away from him
he walks towards her
his grin quietly disappears
malcolms face turns to rock as his attention is drawn to the shattered window in their bedroom
the wind moves through the room
a lamp lays broken on the ground by the window
malcolm kneels down
annas eyes fill with a quiet awareness
hes still in the house
malcolm spins around
his heart stops
malcolm and anna stare at the bathroom doorwary
they know someone is inside
malcolm slowly starts towards the door
the first thing that comes into view are the clothes on the bathroom floor
then the figure of a man comes into view
a stranger stands bare chested in the back of the bathroom
the stranger is about nineteen
pitch black eyes bulging
his body is covered in scars and bruises
his hands are folded in front of him
he shakes ever so slightly
he has a patch of white in his hair
malcolm speaks in a very calm voice
never takes his eyes off the stranger
anna dont move
dont say a word
anna barely nods her understanding
to the stranger this is forty seven locust street
you have broken a window and entered a private residence
do you understand what im saying
the stranger slowly looks up for the first time
his eyes lock on malcolm
you dont know so many things
there are no needles or prescription drugs of any kind in this house
the stranger suddenly comes forward into the doorway
malcolm stumbles back onto the edge of the bed
anna sees the stranger for the first time
her face drains of color
the stranger looks at malcolm
he half grins
are you drunk
the strangers stare slides to anna
did you get him drunk
the stranger gazes at anna
gazes directly into her eyes
a penetrating unwavering stare
do you know why youre scared when youre alone
annas expression instanly changes
what do you want
i dont understand what you want
the stranger turns and glares at malcolm
what you promised
malcolm stops all movement
do i know you
lets all celebrate dr
recipient of awards from the mayor on the news
malcolm crowe hes helped so many children
and he doesnt even remember my name
malcolm cant speak
the strangers face starts to tremble
i was ten when you worked with me
malcolms intelligent eyes race for answers
single parent family
beat i had a possible mood disorder
beat i had no friends
you said i was socially isolated
beat i was afraid you called it acute anxiety
beat you were wrong
beat come on clear your head
malcolm looks like someone hit him with a sledgehammer
i have drugs in my system twenty four hours a day
i still have no friends
i still have no peace
im still afraid
tears jump into the strangers eyes
im still afraid
please give me a second to think
malcolms shaking hands touch his mouth as he stares at the stranger
some people call me freak
tears fall down the strangers face
i am a freak
malcolm looks up at the sound of those words
something clicks in his head
vincent gray stares with surprise through his tears
malcolm lets out a deep breath like he just emerged from deep waters
i do remember you vincent
you were a good kid
vincents eyes burn at malcolm
you forgot cursed
vincent is fully crying now
you failed me
im sorry i didnt help you
i can try to help you now
vincent turns to the sink
his hand goes in
he turns arund and raises a gun at malcolm
a violent ear shattering echo
malcolm clutches his stomach and folds like a rag doll onto the bed
vincent instantly moves the gun to his own head
another horrific blast spikes the air
vincent crumples onto the bathroom floor
the legend two years later appears
a man flips open a worn file folder on his lap
handwritten notes fill every line
at the top of the first page reads vincent gray age referred january
the mans hand touches the name almost reverently
he glances through the page
words and phrases are circled throughout the file
possible mood disorder
parent status divorced
communication difficulty between mother child dyad the mans hands flip the page
at the top of this new page reads cole sear age referred september
as the mans fingers move through the notes we again see words and phrases circled throughout this new case history
possible mood disorder
parent status divorced
communication difficulty between mother child dyad the hands close the notepad
the hands are slightly shaking now
we pull back to reveal the shaking hands belong to dr
malcolm sits on a sidewalk bench facing a row of brownstone homes across the street
he gazes blankly at the brownstones
a door opens
malcolm is brought out of his trance
cole sear steps out his front door
cole is a munchkin of a boy with large black eyes that seem to take in everything around him
his hair is dark with a small patch of jet white on the side
cole carefully locks the door behind him
he moves to the bottom of the stairs and looks around nervously
the eight year old child reaches into his pocket and slips on a pair of very large glasses
they look comical on him
malcolm rises to his feet
he smooths out his shirt
looks down and buttons his jacket
when he looks up cole is gone
malcolm barely catches a glimpse of the boy
cole runs at full speed down the street and turns the corner
tiny sneakers for a second malcolm doesnt react
the second passes
he stuffs the file in his bag and starts running too
malcolm hauls down the sidewalk
he comes to a hard stop at a street intersection
spots cole running into a parking lot
cole sprints across the empty lot and reaches the doors of a building
he has to use all his strength to push open the highly ornate doors
he slips inside
malcolm jogs into the parking area
his pace slows to a walk and then to stillness as he gazes up at the building
its old stone and huge towers make it stand out from the modern buildings all around it
malcolm stares up at the historic philadelphia church quietly
a shooting pain pierces his side
malcolms hand goes to it quickly
he waits for it to pass before starting for the ornate doors
only a few people sit and pray in the sea of oak pews
malcolm scans the majestic room and finds what hes looking for in the last row of the church
he moves down the center aisle towards the back
malcolm finds cole playing in his pew with a set of green and beige plastic soldiers
cole makes the soldiers talk to each other
the words are unintelligible
cole senses someone
he looks up and sees malcolm staring at him
the boy immediately goes white
every cell of his body still with fear
its okay cole
dont be frightened
cole stays rigid
hands clutching a handful of plastic riflemen
my name is dr
i was supposed to meet you today
sorry i missed our appointment
malcolm waits for a response
do you mind if i sit down
i have this injury from a couple of years ago and it flares up every once in a while just so i wont forget it
cole slowly slides down the pew giving malcolm most of the seat
cole fidgets with his soldiers
malcolm looks over and stares at coles glasses
he leans forward to inspect them more carefully
your eye frames
they dont seem to have any lenses in them
soft theyre my dads
the lenses hurt my eyes
i knew there was a sound explanation
malcolm returns to staring at his lap
what was that you were saying before with your soldiers
day pro fun
de profundis clamo ad te domine
malcolm stares surprised
its called latin
its a language
malcolm nods at the information
all your soldiers speak latin
no just one
malcolm smiles at cole
his eyes drift down to coles arms
malcolms smile slowly disappears
coles arms are covered in tiny cuts and bruises
some almost healed
malcolm looks around to gather himself
i like churches too
beat in olden times in europe people used to hide in churches
cole looks up
what were they hiding from
oh lots of things i suppose
bad people for one
people who wanted to imprison them
nothing bad can happen in a church right
malcolm studies coles anxious face
malcolm and cole just stare at each other
i forgot your name
youre a doctor
i work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk
i try to help them figure things out
are you a good doctor
i got an award once
from the mayor
it was a long time ago
ive kind of been retired for a while
beat youre my very first client back
you use needles
not even little ones that arent supposed to hurt
cole pockets his soldiers and rises from his pew
im going to see you again right
if its okay with you
cole thinks it over carefully
its okay with me
cole and malcolm just stare at each other
and cole next time i wont be late for you
next time i wont be scared of you
cole turns and starts to the rear of the church
malcolm loses himself in his thoughts
when malcolm looks back he sees cole stop by the exit doors and take a tiny statue of jesus off the back table
cole pockets the statue and quietly leaves the church
malcolm just sits and stares
the house is dimly lit
malcolm has to turn on the hallway light
he stops before a pile of mail collecting on a thin table
he stares at it blankly
almost every envelope has over due or final notice stamped on it
malcolm stares down at the remains of a meal on the only place setting on the table
malcolm quietly walks into his bedroom
only a reading light is malcolm moves to her side
the sight of her stops him
he stares at his wife
she huddles under a blanket a wad of tissues in her hand
he takes it in silently
his eyes move to her face
one wisp of hair falls over her soft lips
outlined in the soft reading light anna crowe truly looks like an angel
malcolm forms a tiny smile
malcolm turns and moves for a narrow door in the hallway
the door knob
he tries to open it
malcolm reaches into his pockets
searches for his keys
the empty basement is no longer empty
its piled with file cabinets and boxes of psychology and medical books
a desk sits in the corner next to the wine racks
the room still feels unsettling
malcolm hunches over one of the books
rifles through a stack of dusty books
pulls out a thick text
the spine of the text reads the meridian latin dictionary
malcolm sits back at his desk and opens coles file
handwritten on the first page are the words de profundis calms ad te domine malcolm starts working through the latin text
as he comes to each word he jots it down underneath the latin
malcolm translates the last word
he stares quietly at the paper
the new words reads
out of the depths i cry to you lord
whispers the mass for the dead
the words seem to hang in the air forever
old philadelphia awakens
for a moment its like were back in time
a golden sun dances on the waters of penns landing
historical old ships sit docked in its harbor
the dark bronze surface of the liberty bell reflects the dawn
a majestic independence hall stands watch as its city begins to stir
a thirty foot statue of ben franklin makes a proud silhouette against the morning sky
fluorescent house lights come on in windows
jeeps and hatchbacks start roaming the cobblestone streets
neon restaurants signs flicker to life
traffic helicopters make their rounds
car alarms pierce the air
a hand turns off a radio shutting off the morning news
a small dog with two different colored eyes sticks his head out of the dryer where he plays with the newly dried clothes
lynn sear reaches in and pulls out a blouse
she shakes it in the air and slips it on as she dresses hurriedly for work
lynn is a woman in her late twenties
one hundred percent south philly
she chews on an early morning piece of trident
under all of it lynn sear is an attractive and sweet looking young woman
lynn enters the kitchen through a swinging door
a bowl of cereal and milk sit on a table in an empty kitchen
lynn stares at a handful of kitchen cabinets and drawers that are open
lynn shakes her head
she closes them one at a time before moving to the coffee machine
lynn shivers a little
she leans over the thermostat and raises the heat
she returns to her post at the coffee machine
lynn turns to see cole standing in his private school uniform
your cocoa puffs are getting soggy
lynn walks over to cole
checks his tie
you got a spot
lynn unclips the tie
cole takes a seat at the kitchen table as lynn walks back into the laundry room
the dog is gone now
lynn reaches into the dryer digging for a new tie
she finds one then turns and steps back into the kitchen and screams at the top of her lungs
every cabinet and every drawer is wide open
cole sits at the kitchen table
his hands are pressed flat on the tabletop
he looks shaken
neither says anything for a beat
shaken something you were looking for baby
shaken pop tarts
lynn looks over to the open cabinet near the sink
the pop tarts are clearly visible
theyre right here
cole gets up from the table
takes his pop tarts
doesnt make eye contact
what are you thinking momma
lots of things
anything bad about me
lynn leans down
look at my face
i wasnt thinking anything bad about you got it
he looks at her eyes
soft thats tommy momma
cole quietly kisses his mother on the cheek and starts out
dont you want this
cole turns to see lynn holding the pop tarts
he walks back and takes them from her before leaving
lynn glances to the kitchen table
her gaze stops on the two tiny hand prints of sweat formed on the tables surface
lynn stands motionless in the kitchen
she looks up and wraps her arms around her shivering shoulders
tommy tammisimo is a tough looking eight year old italian kid who waits at the bottom of coles brownstone stairs in his school uniform
cole emerges from the brownstone and moves down the steps
lynns face appears in the kitchen window
the two boys begin their walk down the street to school
tommy puts his arm around cole
cole waves back
when the two boys turn the corner and are out of lynns sight tommy rips his arm away
hey freak howd you like the arm around your shoulder bit
i just made it up
went with it
thats what great actors do
its called improv
tommy starts to run ahead he turns and back pedals
taunting be careful
i hope no one jumps out and gets you
tommy runs away
cole looks around nervously
the last uniformed boys and girls rush into the front doors of st
anthonys academy as the final bell sounds
cole is the last one to go in
he stands alone on the sidewalk
he looks like hed rather be anywhere but there
he buries his hands in his pockets and begins a quiet walk by himself into the school
the front door creaks open as cole walks in after school
he looks around before closing the door
his eyes stop on lynn seated in the open doorway of the den
malcolm is seated with her
they both look up
lynn comes out
she reaches cole kneels down in front of him
whispers how was school baby
whispers you know you can tell me things if you need to
cole doesnt respond
whispers well you know what i did today
cole shakes his head no
whispers i won the pennsylvania lottery in the morning
i quit my jobs
ate a big picnic in the park with lots of chocolate mouses pie and then swam in the fountain all afternoon
smiling what did you do
cole starts to smile too
whispers i was picked first for kickball teams at recess
i hit a grand slam to win the game and everyone lifted me up on their shoulders and carried me around cheering
cole and lynn smile at each other
lynn tries to hide the utter sadness behind her smile
ill make triangle pancakes
you got an hour
lynn takes coles school bag and jacket before moving to the kitchen
the den doubles as a playroom
boxes of old toys sit in the corner
a small plastic multi colored table sits on the rug
cole appears in the doorway
malcolm sits up and smiles
he points to the chair on the other side of the coffee table
you want to sit
cole nods very softly no
dont feel like talking right now
cole nods again very softly no
how about we play a game first
cole looks a little more interested
its a mind reading game
did i mention i could read minds
cole nods no
heres the game
ill read your mind
if what i say is right you take a step forwards the chair
if im wrong you take a step backwards the doorway
if you reach the chair you sit
if you reach the door you can go
cole tilts his head then nods yes
malcolm presses his fingers to his temples like a vaudeville magician
he closes his eyes tight
just after your mom and dad were divorced your mom went to a doctor like me and it didnt help her
and so you think im not going to help you
cole surprised takes a small step forward
youre worried because she said she told him things
things she couldnt tell anybody else
cole takes a step
malcolm opens his eyes
he looks right at cole
you have a secret
but you dont want to tell me
cole takes another step
the next step will put him at the chair
malcolm lowers his fingers from his temple
whispers you dont have to tell me your secret if you dont want to
returns his fingers to the mind reading position
malcolm looks to coles arm
cole is wearing a large silver watch
it swims on his thin wrist
it could probably slide up to his shoulder
malcolm closes his eyes
your father gave you that watch as a present before he left
cole takes a step back
malcolm lowers his hands surprised
he forgot it in a drawer
it doesnt work
malcolm puts his fingers to his temple
this time a little bit slower
he gazes at coles school uniform
you dont like to say much at school
youre an excellent student however
youve never been in any kind of serious trouble
cole takes a slow step back
we were supposed to draw a picture
anything we wanted
i drew a man
he got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver
you saw that on t
cole answers by taking a small step back
everybody got upset
they had a meeting
momma started crying
beat i dont draw like that anymore
how do you draw now
i draw people with smiles dogs running and rainbows
beat they dont have meetings about rainbows
soft i guess they dont
malcolm looks down at coles feet
theyre almost at the doorway
one more step and hes there
cole is very still
he doesnt move at all
whispers what am i thinking now
malcolm takes his time before speaking
he just stares
no fingers to the temple
he just stares
beat i dont know what youre thinking cole
cole quietly takes a step back into the doorway of the other room
whispers i was thinking
beat but you cant help me
coles tiny figure steps away
malcolm stares helplessly at the empty doorway where his client used to stand
malcolm hurriedly enters a spacious dimly lit italian restaurant
he stops in the dining room and searches the many candle lit tables
he finds anna
anna sits alone at a corner table
the remains of her half eaten dinner lay on the only place setting on the table
a small piece of cake with a candle in it sits untouched
anna stirs sugar in her coffee as malcolm sits in the seat across from her
she gently stops stirring but doesnt look up
i thought you meant the other italian restaurant i asked you to marry me in
anna isnt laughing
not even close
im so sorry
beat i cant seem to keep track of time
anna quietly takes a sip from her coffee
it didnt go well today
spent some time after trying to get my head together
anna looks around for the waiter
theyre so similar anna
they have the same mannerisms
the same expressions
the same thing hanging over them
beat it might be some kind of abuse
that makes anna turn back
she glances across the table then looks down
there are cuts on coles arms
fingernail marks i think
looks like defensive cuts
malcolm demonstrates by holding up his arm to shield his face
beat possibly a teacher neighbor
beat i dont think its the mother
just a gut thing
the way she deals with him
it doesnt fit
beat hard to say this early
could just be a child climbing a lot of trees
malcolm loses himself in his thoughts
the waiter drops off the check on the table
anna grabs it before malcolm and quickly signs it
i know ive been kind of out of it for a long while and you resent it
i know youre mad
i know its put some distance between us
but im getting a second chance here
i cant let it slip away
anna waits till hes done and rises from the table
she pushes her chair in hard and walks away without a word
malcolm sits alone and stares at the piece of cake with a candle on it
soft happy anniversary
cole is seated on the front stoop of his brownstone
on the steps and on the landing are his plastic soldiers in the grips of a war
malcolm sits with his bag and overcoat on the step next to him
malcolm just observes quietly
cole glances up as he plays
sees malcolms expression
you want to ask me a question
see this is why i lose at poker
yes i do have a question
on the step are two rows of soldiers facing each other
to one side are a couple soldiers covered by a tissue
malcolm points to them
what happened to those two
being under tissue paper cant be a good thing
cole removes the tissue
thats private jenkins and private kinney
they got killed
private jenkins has a baby girl that was born seven pounds six ounces
hes never seen her
he wanted to get back to blue bell pennsylvania and hold her
cole points to the other soldier
private kinneys wife is really sick she has something called a brain anism
soft you mean aneurysm
yeah private kinney needed to get back safe to take care of her
coles face becomes emotional
tears fill his eyes
its sad they died isnt it
malcolm falls into silence and stares at his client
cole wipes his eyes quickly
dont look at me
beat i dont like people looking at me like that
malcolm takes in coles gesture and expression
stop looking at me
malcolm looks down
where should i look then cole
look over there
cole points to the corner of the street
malcolm slowly turns
he sits in profile to cole
its very unusual for someone your age to understand the kind of problems that private jenkins and private kinney have or even to be thinking about them at all
malcolm continues to stare at the street
it is okay if i look back now
cole doesnt answer
tap the foot once for no and twice for yes
cole taps his foot once
malcolm sits patiently
they dont say anything for a while
you wouldnt want to take a walk would you
cole looks up from his soldiers
malcolm stares at the far side of the street
cole taps his foot twice
the two of them walk down a row of brownstones across from a park where children coles age are playing
i walk this way to school with tommy tammisimo
he your best buddy
cole almost smiles
he hates me
you hate him
cole shakes his head no
malcolm thinks for a bit
your mom set that up
cole nods yes
you ever tell her about how it is with tommy
i dont tell her a thing
cause she doesnt look at me like everybody and i dont want her to
i dont want her to know
that im a freak
malcolm stops walking
the words hit him hard
he stares at cole
listen to me
you are not a freak
dont you believe anybody that tells you that
its bullshit and you dont have to grow up believing that
cole is surprised
you said the s word
malcolms face is filled with emotion
cole is suddenly hit by malcolms passion
cole nods slowly as he looks at malcolm with different eyes
they start walking again in silence
they turn a corner and move down another street
cole spots an old man with a cane standing at the gate of a brownstone
is it okay if i do something
i have to do something
malcolm nods yes as they continue walking
cole slows as they approach the old man
as we get closer we make out the man can barely see
marschal leans over his gate and stares at cole for a few seconds
guten tag cole
marschal has a thick german accent
the old man squints down the block with a concerned expression
she went food shopping
shes running late
ich habe durst
malcolms eyes dart to cole
where did you learn to speak german
i just know a couple lines
yes you may have a drink
what would you like
marschal smiles at cole before walking back inside his house
cole turns back to malcolm
marschal gets real lonely
what about mrs
whispers she died a long time ago
this brownstone has been home to the marschals for many many years
its filled with a lifetime of memories
memories shared by two people
two rocking chairs sit side by side near the windows that overlook the street
a corner table displays fancy wooden chess set
the game half finished frozen in a layer of dust
an easel stands before a piano
the incomplete water color painting of a smiling elderly woman sitting on the piano bench sits sadly on the faded yellow paper
malcolm takes in the living room silently
he stands near the open door
cole walks through the room
tiny eyes searching carefully
he leans behind the sofa looking for something
malcolm watches cole with a crinkled brow
cole peeks behind the old piano crammed against the wall
maybe jill will play for us when she gets back
cole turns to find mr
marschal standing with a glass of lemonade
cole takes it from his shaking hands
marschal shuffles over to the sofa
takes a seat
cole begins surveying the room again
his eyes finally come to rest on a plant seated in the corner
he stares at it
cole puts down his glass on a table and walks over to the plant
cole kneels down and starts to push the potted plant aside
the malcolm calls to cole under his breath
cole whats going on there
marschal strains to see across the room
cole doesnt answer either of them
instead he continues to push the plant aside revealing an air vent
cole gently reaches over and takes off the metal face
it slips right off
coles hands disappear into the darkness of the vent
they reemerge holding a stack of notebooks
malcolm becomes very still
cole rises to his feet and carries the notebooks over to mr
cole carefully places them on his lap
is this for me
marschal fingers the notebooks then reaches for his thick glasses hanging from his neck
he places them on the tip of his nose and inspects the notebooks six inches from his face
jills keeping a diary
malcolm takes an involuntary step forward
marschal starts flipping through the notebooks
shes full of surprises
he gets to the last book
his hands become still as he stares at the final page of writing
whispers she hasnt written anything for some time
marschal slowly looks up from the notebooks
looks up to cole
cole just stands quietly
marschals eyes slowly fill with tears of realization
they gently spill down his weathered face
cole takes a deep breath
trying hard not to cry himself
the sight of mr
marschal weeping shakes cole
cole softly lays his hand on mr
marschals silver hair
marschal reaches up and clutches his small hand
they stay like that for a while
marschal lets go and brings the notebooks tighter to his body
cole quietly walks to malcolm who stands motionless
he stares down at cole in a daze
cole turns his head crying
softly stop looking at me
malcolm sits still in his office chair
his eyes are fixed at a point in space
he brings a slim black tape recorder to his mouth
april or march of eighty seven
two weeks into sessions with vincent gray
i was treating a couple donald and robin wagner who had lost their child to leukemia
they were waiting with vincent in the reception room of the downtown clinic
they were alone together maybe fifteen minutes
when i entered the room all three were crying
the wagners progress from that afternoon was dramatic and sudden as if some door had been opened for them
beat im not at all clear what happened in those fifteen minutes
but i now believe vincent tried to tell me something show me something and i didnt listen
beat cole sear allowed me to witness something today
beat this time im going to listen
a long silence
the tape recorder turns off
lynn holds a laundry basket on her hip as she fiddles with the thermostat in the hall
the house is cold
lynn wears a winter jacket in the house
lynn turns and moves into the shadowy hallway
the house seems somewhat ominous
lynns eyes dart to an open guest room like she just saw something
she stares in the doorway until a sound turns her in she picks up balled up boys sweat socks and dirty t shirts laying on the carpet
when she reaches the end of the hall she hits a light switch
the hall lights up revealing a wall of photos
lynn forms a tiny smile
snapshots of cole and lynns life hang before her eyes
coles birthday parties
lynn and cole at an amusement park
cole under the christmas tree
cole on lynns shoulders in a pool
cole with a group of neighbors at a barbecue
lynn takes a step forward
lynns face betrays the fact that she notices something she never noticed before
she touches a photo of three year old cole
lynn looks to the adjacent photo the barbecue photo everyone stands with hot dogs and sodas
lynn searches the picture
her eyes suddenly stop at the tiniest blur of white lynn takes it all in curiously
lynn moves into coles room with the laundry basket balanced on her hip
the walkman headphones on her head blares a muffled techno dance beat
lynn starts picking clothes up around coles room
this bedroom is an eerie place
the shadows seem to make shapes and figures
all the furniture is wood old fashioned
the lamps the paintings on the wall antiques as well
the most striking feature of the room however is the homemade tent created from bedsheets and blankets tied to chairs and bureaus
it takes up a large corner of the room
a sign hangs over the bedsheets
lynn grabs the spiderman p
s that drape over the tent
a german shepherd puppy sleeps on the pillow
sebastian lifts his head sleepily and peers at lynn before returning to his slumber
lynn slowly reaches for a picture frame that peeks out from under coles pillow
slides it out
its a vacation photo of a couple
lynn and cole and a man
the man looks in every way a larger version of cole
the picture has a visible effect on lynn
she lets out a shaky breath before returning the photo to its hiding place
lynn pulls a pair of school uniform pants off the wooden roll cover desk next to the bed
the desk is covered with loose leaf papers filled with writings
lynns eyes are drawn to the papers
her curious gaze turns serious
her mouth opens a tiny bit involuntarily
the papers are strewn with lines of handwriting
thousands of words
some horizontal some vertical
the writing moves in arcs and flows in various size written at great speed every word connected by a single pen stroke everything written in one continuous motion
lynn slowly spins the papers taking in some of the phrases
christ break the freaking glass oh no god no what the hell is going on quiet the damn baby ill cut you i swear it someone stop the burning ill
kill you ill kill all you bastard
the words go on and on
lynn removes her hands from the paper
she pulls her headphones off slowly
malcolm stares as the rain pelts the windows of the den
so your dad lives in pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth
what if she has to pee when shes working
you think she just holds it
i dont know
i was just thinking the same thing
you ask a lot of questions about my dad today
cole is playing behind the couch
all we see is the top of his head
sometimes we dont even know it but we do things to draw attention
do things so we can express how we feel about issues
divorce or whatever
every now and then we get glimpses of things cole is playing with peeking over the back of the couch but we cant quite make out what hes doing
one night as an example
leave something on a desk for someone to find
the top of coles head stops moving
cole have you ever heard of something called free writing
or free association writing
cole shakes his head no
its when you put a pencil in your hand and put the pencil to a paper and you just start writing
you dont think about what youre writing
you dont read over what youre writing
you just keep your hand moving
cole has become very still
he looks right at malcolm
after awhile if you keep your hand moving long enough words and thoughts start coming out you didnt even know you had in you
sometimes theyre things you heard from somewhere
sometimes theyre feelings deep inside
beat have you ever done any free association writing cole
cole nods yes
whatd you write
what kind of words
did you ever write any upset words before your father left
i dont remember
malcolm watches him carefully
malcolm waves the question off casually
can you do something for me
he rises and grabs his coat
think about what you want from our time together
what our goal should be
something i want
if we could change something in your life anything at all what would you like that to be
coles brow furrows as he thinks about it carefully
you dont have to answer now
malcolm heads for the door stops when cole emerges from behind the couch
cole is wearing his fathers jacket it hangs to the ground like a dress
instead of something i want can i have something i dont want
malcolm turns back to cole
malcolm nods yes
i dont want to be scared anymore
coles sad eyes stare up at malcolm
the surface of malcolms desk is covered with open texts
malcolm pours over a thick reference book
he circles a phrase
resulting bruises and abrasions on arms and legs may in fact be self inflicted
malcolm appears disturbed by the thoughts running through his head
his face turns up to the ceiling
loud are you calling me
you dont see enough of me at the store
malcolm gets up and moves closer to their voices as he stretches his legs
mans voice o
on my way to the flea market in amish country
thought maybe you want to come
show me how to buy at these things
i trust you
besides i dont know if im up for the amish today
you cant curse or spit or anything around them
malcolm smiles at anna
mans voice o
i thought youd want to get out
youve been kind of down
malcolm slowly stops smiling
thats very sweet
mans voice o
do you think i should stop by on my way back
show you what i got
its not a problem
malcolm shakes his head in disbelief
you know thats probably not the best idea
ill just wait to see them in the store
mans voice o
beat im off then
dont step in the horse manure
mans voice o
malcolm moves to the narrow basement window
we see sean an attractive young man in his late twenties
he gets into his car across the street
he just sits there for a moment before putting his forehead to the steering wheel
under his breath give it up kid
malcolm turns away from the window as seans car starts up and pulls away from malcolms house
stanley cunningham is a teacher in his late forties
he writes a question on the board
can anyone guess what city was the capital of the united states of america from to
cunningham turns and stares at his class of eight and nine year old private school students
they stare back at him blankly
cole rests his chin on his desk and watches the class with big eyes
ill give you a hint its the city you live in
the class says the answer in unison
philadelphia is one of the oldest cities in the country
a lot of generations have lived and died in this city
almost every place you visit has a history and a story behind it
beat even this school and the grounds they sit on
can anyone guess what this building was used for a hundred years ago before you went here before i went to this school even
stanley cunningham looks over the class of blank faces
hes just about to answer his own question when he sees a hand go up
cunningham looks surprised to see who it is
they used to hang people here
cunningham furrows his brow
thats not correct
whered you hear that
theyd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye
people watching would spit at them
cole this was a legal courthouse
laws were passed here
some of the first laws of this country
this building was full of lawyers
they were the ones who hanged everybody
coles face turns cement grey
i dont know which one of these guys told you that but they were just trying to scare you i think
tommy tammisimo leads the class in a wave of snickering
cole glances up
sees all the eyes on him
he glances at the teacher who is still staring
i dont like people looking at me like that
cunningham sees the traumatized expression on coles face and instantly stops smiling
i dont know how else to look youre a stuttering stanley
cunninghams face becomes still
so does the classroom
you talked funny when you went to school here
you talked funny all the way to high school
the class falls into stunned silence
cunningham takes an involuntary step towards coles desk
what you shouldnt laugh at people
it makes them feel bad
cunningham moves closer to cole
how did you
stop looking at me
cole covers his eyes with his hands
who have you been s speaking to
we see coles mouth under his covered eyes
cunningham is standing right over coles desk now
s ssstop that
s ssssstop it
stuttering shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak
cunningham slams his hand on coles desk
coles hands drop from his eyes
the teachers face is burning red
the children in the room are frozen
coles eyes are filled with tears
cunninghams expression drains of anger as cole sear begins to cry
cole is seated in the school library by himself
he sits at a long center table near the windows
his head is laying on his folded arms on the table
malcolm peeks his head in the door unsure if hes in the right place
he spots cole and enters the room
he silently takes a seat across from cole
the eight year old looks up
coles eyes are hard filled with anger
hey big guy
cole stares for a second
i dont want to talk about anything
cole lowers his head
malcolm just sits and thinks
cole turns his head and stares at the windows
malcolm takes in the sad vision of this boy
it affects him
do you like magic
coles face softens a bit
he turns from the windows and looks to malcolm
cole nods yes
malcolm pulls out a penny from his pocket
he places it in his right hand
watch the penny closely
malcolm closes his hand around the penny
i do the magic shake
malcolm shakes his hand in circles
cole watches his hand carefully
and suddenly the penny has magically traveled to my left hand
cole looks to malcolms closed left hand
malcolm doesnt open it
but thats not the end of the trick
with another magic shake the penny travels into my shirt pocket
coles eyes lock on malcolms shirt
malcolm taps the pocket but doesnt open it
but thats still not the end
i do a final magic shake
the penny returns to the hand where it started from
malcolm opens his right hand
the penny sits quietly in the center of his palm
cole looks at the penny and then up to malcolms face
cole cracks a smile
that isnt magic
you just kept the penny in that hand the whole time
malcolm smiles a mischievous smile
he places the penny on the table
cole stares at it and then looks to malcolm
i didnt know you were funny
i forgot myself
malcolm and cole share a warm look
coles expression changes back to sadness as he looks to the windows
malcolm leans across the table and whispers
cole looks at malcolm
beat youre going to sound just like them
coles chin starts to tremble
his voice cracks
malcolm and cole sit in silence and listen to the sound of malcolm sorts through the many bills on the mail table
malcolm sit your cute butt down and listen up
beat are you listening
malcolm turns at the sound of the woman and moves into the empty living room where the t
a blanket lays crumpled on the sofa
no doubt about it
annas like my sister
you better make her happy
and im not talking about mmm this tastes like real butter kind of happy
im talking about julie andrews twirling around like a mental patient on a mountain top kind of happy
youre really lucky
shes got so much love for you
dont tell her i told you but she said she loved you from the first time she met you on the street
shed do anything for you
crying i love you guys
more crying my nose is running
why isnt someone getting me a tissue
malcolm cant help smiling as he stares at the flickering images
he turns and looks down the hall to their bedroom
malcolm moves into their bedroom
malcolm moves to the bathroom door and opens it slowly
malcolm steps into the bathroom quietly
he stares at the silhouette of annas body through the smoked glass of the shower
anna stands still her head tilted back
malcolm watches quietly
by his experience its clear hes taken by his wifes beauty
malcolm starts towards the shower when his eyes glance to the sink
malcolm locks on a tiny bottle resting on the marble surface
he reaches out and picks it up
the label on the plastic bottle reads zoloft anti depressant to be taken twice daily malcolm gently puts down the plastic bottle
he gazes at the still figure of his wife as the water covers her
malcolm leaves the bathroom
he makes sure not to make a noise with the door as he closes it shut
colorful balloons flutter in the wind in front of an old grey stone home
cole and an overweight boy named bobby are seated at a dining table covered in colorful paper
a stack of birthday presents are sitting on the table next to a cake
the house is filled with the sound of children playing and cole and the overweight boy are the only ones in the dining room
bobby watches with a dull expression as cole moves his hand in circles in the air
then you do the magic shake
and now the penny moves from my pocket all the way to the hand it started in
cole smiles and holds out his hand
his fingers open to reveal the penny
cole loses his smile
its supposed to be funny
cole and the overweight boy stare at each other
give me my penny back
cole gives the boy his penny
cole gazes at bobby
almost inaudible dont be sad
bobby looks up sharply
hard whatd you say
bobby stares down at him before returning his attention to his tattered napkin
the two boys sit in silence
cole sits alone in the corner of the living room
the open kitchen doorway is next to him
inside the kitchen are lynn and darrens mom speaking
its clear theyre from different worlds
lynn is wearing tight clothes with hair teased to dramatic heights
darrens mom is in a designer suit
he doesnt get invited places
its our pleasure
the last time was a chuck e
cheese party a year ago
he hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didnt come out
its a kids place
darrens mom smiles formally and turns to give the catering people instructions on how to lay out the food on her sterling silver trays
hes my whole life
darrens mom turns back to lynn the forced smile on her face
i work at an insurance place and at pennys so cole can go to that good school
lynn nods yes
bullshit good for you
i wish i could be like my momma though
she always knew what was wrong
knew just what to say
darrens mom glances at her expensive watch
coles going through something bad
he wont talk to me
beat im his momma
emotional and i dont know whats wrong and i dont know what to say
lynn drowns in her thoughts
cole moves away from the kitchen with sad eyes
cole walks past two expensively dressed mothers eating hors doeuvres as they move down the hallway
did you have the brie
it tasted like cheese whiz
they pass when cole moves down the shiny mahogany wood hallway
the womens conversation fades away behind him
cole turns a corner and comes to a dead stop
he turns white as he stares at an open crawl space closet a few feet away
coles eyes are riveted in the darkness of the closet
tommy tammisimo is one of the children
he talks with the birthday boy darren a skinny kid in a party hat
i even got a trailer
you only had one line
youre slow you know that
the star of the commercial always has his own trailer
you need to think about your character alone
tommy glances down the hall and sees cole standing frozen staring at the crawl space closet
tommy grabs darren
darren check it out
darren looks down the hall to cole
my dad made me invite him
tommy nudges darren to move down the hall
cole breaks from his trance as tommy and darren walk up
happy birthday darren
something you want to see in there
tommy points to the crawl space
too quick no
tommy looks to darren and then back to cole
were going to put on a pretend play
you want to be in it
its called locked in the dungeon
tommy stares at darren
darren finally gets it
you get to be the one locked in the dungeon
it happens too quick for cole to react
darren and tommy shove cole backwards
he stumbles into the darkness of the crawl space
tommy slams the door closed
darren turns the lock
they crack smiles at each other as cole bangs on the door
the banging goes on for a few seconds and then it just stops
darren and tommy look at each other and then back at the crawl space door
then the screaming begins
darren and tommy back away from the door as cole screams in terror at the top of his lungs
he crashes over and over against the door
his body slamming against the wood
the door rattles like its going to break off its hinges
the two boys are statues as coles blood chilling yells fill the footsteps spike the air as children and mothers come running down the hall
lynn is one of them
darrens mother turns the corner
whos making that noise
she looks to the closet
the high pitched screams cut through cole
lynn and darrens mom rush to the door and turn the knob
the door flies open
lynn reaches in and pulls out cole
hes darrens mom looks into the crawl space theres nothing inside except a couple packing boxes in the back
she looks to lynn
she turns around with cole in her arms
desperate whispers help me get him in the car
colorful murals don the curved walls of the pediatric reception area
a spattering of children accompanied by adults sit and wait
lynn and malcolm are seated at a childrens play table
a game made of a maze of wires sit on the table in front of them
a young resident dr
hill takes a seat at the table with them
he opens up his notes
whats wrong with cole
the tests indicate he did not have a seizure
in fact hes doing fine
after some rest he could go home tonight
lynn closes her eyes
lets out a tense breath
malcolm eyes the doctor as he glances back to an academic looking woman standing at the reception room door
theres something else going on lynn
lynn opens her eyes and catches the doctors expression
what is it
there are some scratches and bruises on your son that concern me
those are from sports from playing
hes not the most coordinated kid but i dont want him to stop trying you know what i mean
doctor hill gestures to the woman standing near the doorway
sloan over there is our social worker at the hospital
shes going to ask you some procedural questions
you think i hurt my child
emotional you think im a bad mother
at this point its just procedure
and you should probably calm down
how do you expect her to react
you want me to answer your questions
sarcastic im sorry if i was being vague yes i do
whos going to answer mine you dick
hill stares at her before closing up his files
raising voice what happened to my child today
hill gets up
something was happening to him physically happening
something was very wrong
hill hands his files to mrs
sloan and exits the reception room without looking back
everyone in the reception room stares at lynn
sloan walks up to the table and waits
lynn takes a second
wipes her eyes
gathers her considerable strength
how long will these questions take
cole lays rigid in the hospital bed
blankets bundled around him as if to shield him
coles eyes fixed out the window
malcolm quietly enters through the half opened door to the room
cole spots him
ive decided we shouldnt schedule sessions anymore
ill just follow you around
cole smiles weakly as malcolm takes a seat on a rolling metal chair
malcolm notices coles legs emerging from under the hospital gown
cole is wearing a mans dress sock
the baggy folds ride up all the way to his knees
your father ever tell you bedtime stories
malcolm looks at cole
malcolm makes a decision
he rolls in the chair across the room as he thinks
once upon a time there was a prince who was being driven around
he drove around for a long long time
driving and driving
it was a long trip
he fell asleep
beat when he woke up they were still driving
the long drive went on dr
you havent told bedtime stories before
you have to add some twists and stuff
maybe they run out of gas
hey thats good
they sit in silence
malcolm works on a new plot in his head
tell me a story about why youre sad
do you think im sad
cole nods yes
what makes you think that
your eyes told me
malcolms affected by his client
rote im not supposed to talk about stuff like that
cole smiles softly
malcolm stares at the tired child sitting before him in the hospital bed
malcolm rolls his stool away from his client as he thinks
he slowly moves the rolling chair closer to coles bed
once upon a time there was this person named malcolm
he worked with children
loved it more than anything
smiles then one night he finds out he made a mistake with one of them
didnt help that one at all
he thinks about that one a lot
beat ever since then things have been different
hes become messed up
not the same person he used to be
beat his wife doesnt like the person hes become
they dont speak anymore
theyre like strangers
malcolm breaks from his thoughts and looks at cole who watches him with unwavering attention
and then one day this person malcolm meets a wonderful boy who reminds him of that one
reminds him a lot of that one
malcolm decides to try to help this new boy
he thinks maybe if he can help this boy it would be like helping that one too
malcolm leans forward whispers with emotional eyes
i dont know how the story ends
i hope its a happy ending
cole looks at malcolms caring eyes
cole stares at malcolm a long time
i want to tell you my secret now
malcolm blinks very slowly
cole takes an eternal pause
a silent tension engulfs them both
i see people
malcolm just gazes quietly
i see dead people
some of them scare me
in your dreams
cole shakes his head no
when youre awake
cole nods yes
dead people like in graves and coffins
no walking around like regular people
they cant see each other
some of them dont know theyre dead
they dont know theyre dead
i see ghosts
malcolm becomes completely motionless
works to hide his shock
he and cole stare at each other a long time
they tell me stories
things that happened to them
things that happened to people they know
malcolms words are extra controlled
how often do you see them
all the time
beat you wont tell anyone my secret right
will you stay here till i fall asleep
malcolm nods yes
cole pulls the covers up to his chin and turns to the window in the room
malcolm is very still and stares at cole
malcolms eyes slowly turn and survey the room
they find nothing
malcolm returns to watching cole
and then we see what hes staring at
through coles hospital room window we see the adjacent wing of the hospital building
rows of hospital room windows are visible
in the windows are patients
some old some young
some are dressed in modern malcolm hails a cab
he steps off the sidewalk lost in his thoughts
steam rises from a street vent
a car malcolm jerks out of the way
his briefcase falls to the ground
his tape recorder falls to the sidewalk
malcolm reaches down and picks it up
beat his pathology is more severe than initially assessed
beat hes suffering from visual hallucinations paranoia symptoms of some kind of school age schizophrenia
beat medication and hospitalization may be required
malcolms hand with the tape recorder drops to his side
whispers im not helping him
malcolm stares into the night
he stands alone as thoughts crash like thunder in his head
the streets turn red as lynn drives home from the hospital in silence
she glances down to her right
cole is curled up asleep on the passenger seat back in his regular clothes a tiny party hat clutched in his hand
he looks like a four year old
the sight of him exhausted and still hits lynn hard
lynns face drowns in deep concern
she lays a hand on coles head as she drives
the front door opens lynn carries cole in
hes asleep on her shoulder
she carries him down the hall to his bedroom
lynn lays cole gently on his bed next to his german shepherd puppy
cole curls up with sebastian
lynn watches the two youngsters sleep for a moment
cole is curled up asleep with a tiny party hat clutched in his hands
he looks like a four year old
lynn has been carrying coles sweater from over her shoulder
she pulls it off and begins to fold it
her attention is drawn to the sweater
she fingers the fabric of the back
her eyes move to cole
in the middle of the back of his t shirt are three small tears
lynn pushes the fabric open with her fingers and sees deep fingernail like scratches on his skin
lynn looks around helplessly fear creeping into her eyes
lynn emerges from coles room
she turns off the hall lights as she moves into her room and closes the door
we hear lynn pick up a phone and dial
hi this is lynn sear coles mother
i wonder if we could talk about your son and his friends keeping their goddamn hands off my boy
the thermostat on the wall reads seventy eight degrees
a few hours later
the house seems threateningly still
an unnatural silence fills each room of the house
the thermostat on the wall now reads fifty two degrees
the door opens a crack
coles tiny face peeks out
eyes scan the darkness
the door opens a little bit more
coles knees are pressed together
his body dances a little
cole has to pee
he moves cautiously into the hall
cole moves briskly to a door halfway down the corridor
cole turns on the light in the bathroom
he checks behind the shower curtain before he turns his back and pees into the toilet
cole instantly stops peeing
his body becomes very still
he slowly reaches for the toilet handle and flushes
he closes his pants and turns
he doesnt come out of the bathroom at first
he just stands there and stares into the darkness of the hall
cole finally steps out into the hallway
his eyes catch a slant of light now coming from the kitchen
cole hesitates before being drawn to the kitchen
he moves down the hall and turns the corner coming to a stop in the doorway of the kitchen
cole stares at the back of a person cooking food on the stove
coles fear slowly fades away
beat dream about daddy again
the person turns
its not lynn
its a strange woman
the womans face is demented
a purple gash cuts across her forehead
all the cabinets and drawers are open behind her
coles face turns the color of ash
what are you going to do
cole backs up to the doorway
you cant hurt me anymore
the woman smiles menacingly as she thrusts her wrists forward
theyve been savagely cut
cole turns and runs down the hall
cole runs across his room
he heads right for the homemade tent seated in the corner with the do not touch sign on it
he scurries in
his legs disappear as the bedsheets flap closed behind him
the crazed woman stands at the end of the hall
doesnt come any closer
cole is curled up in the tent
he lays still for a moment reaching over and flicking on a flashlight
the red interior of the tent gets lip up
its a striking sight
the bedsheet walls of the tent are lined with religious pictures taped to the walls
tiny statues of saints surround the interior perimeter
we see the statue cole stole from the church is in here
this tent is a sanctuary made by an eight year old to hide in
a sign to the side of the stage reads the third and fourth grade presents rudyard kiplings the jungle book
the parents applaud as tommy tammisimo walks out on stage in a villagers outfit
decent british accent there once was a boy very different than other boys
he lived in the jungle and he could talk with the animals
cunningham cues the rest of the children
some are villagers others are dressed as trees and animals
cole comes on stage holding a painted cardboard monkey
the arched halls of the private school are lined with posted drawings and test papers
cole and malcolm walk down an empty hall
did you think the play sucked big time
tommy tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial
he thought everybody was self conscious and unrealistic
he said the play sucked big time
i know every child is special in their own way but tommy sounds like a punk
cole smiles i thought the play was excellent
better than cats
they continue down the hall in silence
malcolm takes his time
cole i was really interested in what you told me in the hospital id like to hear more about it
malcolm stops at a set of doors at the end of the hall realizes cole is no longer next to him
malcolm turns to find cole frozen about ten feet back
malcolm walks to him
he notices coles expression as he gets closer
cole points to the doors
is something in there
cole doesnt say anything
its a large shadowy gym
climbing ropes hang from the wood beamed ceiling
cole is trembling slightly as he stands next to malcolm
what is it
malcolm follows the childs gaze to the ceiling of the gym
i dont see
be real still
malcolm looks to cole and then turns back to the ceiling
malcolms body becomes very still
sometimes you feel it inside
like youre falling down real fast but youre really just standing still
malcolm looks at the wood beams and climbing ropes
you ever feel prickly things on the back of your neck
and the tiny hairs on your arm
are they all standing up
malcolm glances at cole
surprise on his face
whispers when they get mad it gets cold
malcolm looks at the empty stairwell and then back to cole
nothing is said for a few moments
i dont see anything
beat are you sure theyre there
malcolm turns back to cole he finds the child with tears in his eyes
cole looks at malcolm desperately
please make them leave
malcolm stares helplessly
whispers im working on it
malcolm gently leads cole away from the stairs
the ropes and school banners dangling at the top of the stairs sways a little
but so do the three bodies its a truly horrific sight
a black man in britches and no shirt face beaten to a pulp hangs in the center
a white woman in a torn white frilly dress tears soaking her face hangs to the right
a small mixed race child in half pants hangs to their left
the family stares at cole
they follow cole with their tortured eyes as he exits the stairwell
malcolm walks from the bus stop over the cobblestone streets in front of head house square
the streets are quiet and dark
night time has fallen over the city
he slowly comes to a stop in front of an old building
he holds his arm up
uses his other hand to gently touch his hairs on his arms surface
malcolm looks up slowly
the dark shadows fill the corners of the historic building
malcolm stares into the darkness
whispers is anyone there
a long moment as he waits
the shadows seem to move then becomes still
malcolm shakes off the moment
he returns his hands to his pockets as he moves through the dark streets of philadelphia to his home
the doorway to malcolm and annas bedroom is open
strained malcolm o
look hes an eight year old child
hes my only client
if he invites me to his play im not thinking about how late i get back
i have to go
you know that
thats the only way i know how to work
beat vincent said i failed him
raising his voice beat
the portable phone rings out in the hall
please let it ring
we hear movement
anna emerges from the bedroom
she wipes her tears
she picks up the phone and moves down the stairs
malcolm walks out into the hall
stops at the top of the stairs
annas voice can be heard speaking on the phone from downstairs
i cant talk now
malcolm doesnt hear anything as anna listens to the person on the phone
she smiles as she wipes her tears
he starts for the basement door again
whispers i thought about you too
he stands frozen at the top of the stairs
annas hushed words rising in the air like a gun blast
lynn adjusts the thermostat as she tries to keep herself warm
i dont care what they say this thing is definitely broken
lynn fiddles with the dials
cole is standing before the beat up twelve inch kitchen t
on the television screen is tommy tammisimo
he stands in his pajamas in a doorway
mommy my throat hurts
cole watches as tommys t
mother and father give him a spoonful of medicine
pediaease cough suppressant
gentle fast effective
cole watches tommy running around in his t
background the very next t
hes not sick anymore
tommy waves to the camera smiling and healthy
goes black as cole throws his shoe at the power button
he moves to the dinner table where lynn is seated
his hands go on the table
hes wearing a pair of his fathers extra large leather gloves
coles small hands dont even fill the palm area
cole has difficulty trying to pick up his milk glass with the gloves
take em off
cole removes the gloves from his hand and places them next to his plate
i dont want them on my table
cole moves them to the floor
lynn is irritated this is a sore point between them
lynn and cole eat quietly
i saw what was in your bureau drawer when i was cleaning
cole looks up
an anxious expression on his face
you got something you want to confess
cole just stares
the bumble bee pendant
why do you keep taking it
cole looks down at his lap
it was grandmas
its not for playing
beat what if it broke
you know how sad id be
cause you miss grandma so much
soft thats right
so why do you take it sweetheart
sometimes people think they lose things and they didnt really lose them
it just gets moved
did you move the bumble bee pendant
cole shakes his head no
lynn just stares
you didnt take it before
you didnt take it the time after that
and now you didnt take it again

cole doesnt answer

beat maybe someone came in our house took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet and then laid it nicely in your drawer
beat is that what happened
lynn just stares at cole
im so tired cole
im tired in my body
im tired in my mind
im tired in my heart
i need a little help here
beat i dont know if you noticed but our little family isnt doing so good
lynn folds her napkin quietly
im praying for us but i must not be praying right
beat it looks like were just going to have to answer each others prayers
if we cant talk to each other were not going to make it
beat now baby tell me
i wont be mad honey
did you take the bumble bee pendant
coles eyes start to water up
lynn goes cold
youve had enough roast beef
you need to leave the table
cole just stares at his mothers expression
cole gets up never taking his eyes off his mother and leaves the room
cole enters the dark hallway
he gets startled by the sound of sebastian comes racing down the hall and scurries past cole
cole watches his puppy dart into the living room and under a couch
cole slowly turns back and looks down the hall
cole stops breathing
ill show you where my dad keeps his gun
cole is too terrified to move
lynn is kneeling on the kitchen floor trying to coax the puppy out of the broom closet
lynn turns surprised to hear her sons voice
lynns eyes are red from crying
she wipes them quickly with the back of her hand
mother and son look at each other
if youre not very mad
can i sleep in your room tonight
lynn fights back some tears
look at my face cole
lynn smiles at her son
im not very mad
lynn hugs him
why are you shaking
cole doesnt answer
cole whats wrong
cole just closes his eyes and holds his mom tight
desperate please tell me
cole doesnt say a word
we are in an antique store
filled floor to ceiling with furniture and knickknacks
anna stands with a young couple
all three lean over and peer into a glass cabinet
an antique engagement ring sits on a velvet stand
entirely platinum with a mine cut diamond and an actual color burmese sapphire
you got anything a little plainer
the young woman looks at her beau
you want a plain ring to go with your plain fiance
is that how it is
dont get in a tizzy
youre so beautiful
youre like a burmese sapphire all by yourself
you dont need all that
disbelief uh huh
anna smiles as she takes the ring out of the cabinet
why dont you two hold it
she places it in their hands
do you feel longing
when i touch this piece i feel a longing
i imagine the woman who owned this loved a man deeply she couldnt be with
the young woman looks at anna with great intrigue
did he have wavy hair and broad shoulders
the young man throws an odd glance at his fiance
i dont know
beat a lot of the pieces in this store give me feelings
i think maybe when people own things and then they pass away a part of themselves gets printed on those things like fingerprints
the young man and the young woman gaze at anna silently
they look down at the ring
they place their hands on it reverently delicately like checking for a pulse
anna cant hold back her sweet smile
anna moves to the back desk where sean comes out
hes carrying an antique bench in his arms
he places it down and takes a much needed seat
you dont need someone with a masters
you need a wrestler guy whose neck is larger than his head
i need a wrestler with a masters
anna fills out the paperwork for the ring
anna looks over to find sean standing at his desk where a birthday present sits on his tabletop
sean looks at her
anna nods yes
is it wrestling tights
anna smiles as she moves to his desk
sean begins to tear off the wrapping paper like a kid at christmas
sean holds up a weathered hardback copy of the great gatsby
its a first edition
wow this is too much
its perfect anna
sean puts down the book and hugs her
he pulls back a little still holding her
they smile at each other
the moment goes on just that crucial fraction of a second too long
their smiles slowly melt away as they continue to hold each other
nothing happens for the longest time
a shattering door slam echoes through the store
anna and jeffery pull apart
they rush past the young man and the young woman to the front of the store
they find the glass front door cracked in a spider web pattern
they carefully push open the door and step out onto the sidewalk
no one in sight
anna stares down the empty street
a concerned expression on her face
malcolm walks angrily down the sidewalk
he stops as his hand goes to his side
he winces with pain as he keeps walking
lynn and cole emerge from the supermarket
cole rides inside the shopping cart tucked between bags of food
mother and son are quiet as they move towards their car
lynn leans over looks at the side of her sons pensive face
she starts pushing the cart faster
cole wakes from his thoughts as his hair flutters in the wind
he looks back
lynn is smiling as she pushes
cole turns and raises his hands in the air like hes on a roller coaster
they slow and come to a rest at the bumper of their car
lynn leans over sees the side of coles face smiling
lynns face shows a little happiness for the first time
a little hope enters her eyes as she starts to load the groceries into the car
cole and lynn ride home with a back seat full of groceries
cole finishes off a cherry popsicle as he watches out the window
lynn looks over
lets rent a movie
cole bites off the last of the popsicle and glances at his mom
cole stares at his mom quietly
it can even have jean claude van damme in it if you want
cole smiles at that
he nods yes joyfully
his smile fades away as he notices his mother fiddling with the heater controls
cole gazes out the front windshield as the car moves towards home
suddenly a piece of paper sticks to the windshield
its a page from a playbill
it flies away revealing a woman in a flowing flowery dress from the s suddenly walks into the middle of the street as the pages of her playbill swirl in
yells momma look out
the woman in the flowery dress turns
her hand rests on her stomach
we see she is pregnant
playbills stick to the windshield obstructing the view
lynn slams the brakes
the line of cars behind them suddenly hit their brakes and swerve to one side avoiding a mass collision
after a few seconds the entire intersection has come to a halt
cole who has shut his eyes
slowly opens them
he looks around fearfully
his eyes move to the windshield
no broken glass
and no woman
cole looks out through the pristine windshield onto the street where cars are stopped and staring all around them
cole slowly looks over to his mother
he finds her staring at him in complete and utter disbelief
her hands clutch the wheel
the whites of her knuckles showing her fear
she has no idea why he screamed
the den is very quiet
cole and malcolm sit around the multi colored table
malcolm leans back in his small plastic chair arms folded over his chest
cole sits slumped over the table eyes peering out over his arms
they both look like shit
you dont wanna ask me questions today
malcolm nods no
can i ask you then
what do you want more than anything
i dont know
i told you what i want
i dont know cole
why dont you think about it for a while
malcolm doesnt respond
cole watches him
i know what i want
beat my goal is to speak to my wife
the way she and i used to speak
like there was no one in the world but us
soft how are you going to do that
whispers i cant be your doctor anymore
beat i havent given my family enough attention
bad things happen when you do that
do you understand
the room falls into silence again
cole speaks extra soft
you want to go home
malcolm stares across at cole
i have to
malcolm looks down at his eyes full with emotion
im going to transfer you
i know two psychologists that are exceptional whispers dont fail me
malcolm looks up sharply
dont give up
youre the only one who can help me
i know it
malcolm tries to stay composed
it doesnt work
you want to know a secret
i was a paper champion
beat do you know what that means
cole shake his head no
tears fall down malcolms cheeks
i means i wasnt what everyone thought i was
beat i was a fake
you werent a paper champion
someone else can help you
someone else can make you happy
cole is crying now
cole wipes his eyes with his sleeve
they sit quietly and stare at each other
you believe me right
a long pause
crowe you believe my secret right
they both just stare
i dont know how to answer that
cole searches for the answer in malcolms eyes
he finds it
its not the one he wanted
malcolm looks down
how can you help me if you dont believe me
cole reaches into his pocket
pulls out a penny
cole pushes it across the table
malcolm gazes at it then looks up at coles pained eyes
whispers some magics real
malcolm sits stoically at his desk in his basement
his eyes gaze at the dusty framed certificate from the city of philadelphia shoved between two packing boxes
malcolm leans his head back against the chair
stares into the shadows
drowns in his thoughts
the chair creaks as he slowly sits up again
malcolms eyes scan the room and come to a stop on a box marked with the label
a tape slides into the tape player seated on malcolms desk
malcolm hits play
on tape sorry about that
hope i didnt leave you alone too long
wow its cold in here
we hear a chair move as malcolm sits down
and then silence
on tape vincent
why are you crying
on tape crying yes
on tape what happened
beat did something upset you
on tape you wont believe
on tape i wont believe what
on tape i dont want to talk anymore
i want to go home okay
i want to go home
on tape okay vincent you can go home
malcolm just sits in the shadowy basement
he doesnt move for a while
then he hits the rewind button
on tape about that
hope i didnt leave you too long
wow its cold in here malcolm hits the rewind button again
lets it rewind for a while
on tape like needles either
when i was a kid i had this blood test down threw up chill cheese fries all over this male nurse
on tape excuse me doctor reed is on line two
on tape vincent i have to take this
give me a minute
on tape okay
nothing happens for a long time
and then we hear a sudden chair malcolms eyes are locked on the spool of audio tape as it spins in the player
malcolms fingers move to the volume dial
he turns it way up
malcolm leans closer to the tape player
closes his eyes and listens
on tape familia
no dejen que esto me pase
yo no quiero morir
malcolms mouth opens in disbelief
malcolm stands on a familiar sidewalk
he stares into the bay window of mr
inside the window we see mr
marschal seated with a group of older gentlemen his age
they sit around a table eating sandwiches and talking
malcolm watches as mr
marschal tells a story to his friends
we cant hear what hes saying but when he finishes everyone at the table laughs
malcolm cant help smiling as well
this is not the same man he saw before
life has returned to this house
malcolm turns and moves down the street
each step faster than the next
malcolm moves to the front of the church down the center aisle
his eyes scan the empty seats
no one in sight in any direction
malcolm stands in the aisle a little out of breath
he holds his hand to his side as he winces a bit
malcolms eyes float up to the balcony where toy soldiers sit on the bannister
coles head pops up
he looks down and studies malcolm
you been running around
malcolm nods yes
it makes you feel better
malcolm nods yes again
i like to run around
its good exercise
beat you want to ask me questions now
malcolm shakes his head no
you want to be a lance corporal in company m rd battalion th marines
were being dispatched to the quang nam province
cole holds up his plastic rifleman
malcolms eyes show he understands now
something happened didnt it
yes it did
are you wigging out
yes i am
were not gonna start crying again are we
no were not
malcolm glances around the empty church before looking back up to cole
people that died and are still hanging around
maybe they werent ready to go
cole studies malcolms passionate face
a new face
you really look better
maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in
and then all of a sudden its all taken away
no one asked them
its just gone
you have nice red in your cheeks now
do you know what yo no quiero morir is
cole shakes his head no
i dont want to die
beat not all the ghosts are scary are they
what do those ghosts want when they talk to you
think real careful now cole
cole stops moving
he looks over the balcony railing at malcolm
i think thats right
i think they all want that
even the scary ones
you believe now
malcolms stare is unwavering
i believe both of you now
beat and i think i might know how to make them go away
malcolm nods yes
i think they know youre one of those guys rare people can see them
beat you need to help them
each one of them
beat everyone wants to be heard
cole takes a big sigh
fiddles with his riflemen
what if they dont want help
what if theyre just angry and they want to hurt somebody
i dont think thats the way it works cole
cole looks nervous
how do you know for sure
malcolms eyes are drawn to coles arm
peeking out from under his shirt sleeve are a set of cuts
malcolm gazes at them
cole and malcolm stand silently in the center aisle of the back of the church
malcolm moves around the corner on his street
his mind surges with thoughts
and then he glances up
his steps slow to a complete stop
further down the sidewalk coming out of the front door of his house is sean
malcolms face turns to stone
he watches as sean comes down the front stairs and starts across the street
a sudden rage surges up
malcolm moves towards sean fast
sean reaches his car and enters it
he doesnt notice the figure closing in on him
the engine starts
malcolm reaches the car a second late
sean pulls away into traffic almost hitting another car as he does
malcolm watches the car disappear down the next street
malcolm turns and looks up at his home with unchecked anger and overwhelming pain erupting his eyes
malcolm stands in his foyer
anna is sitting on the stairs phone in her hand
she faces away from the front
malcolms a ball of tension as he listens to anna talk into the phone
you just walked out
youre probably on your way home
im leaving this message
i just didnt get to say what i meant
beat i know youre confused
im not prepared to do this sean
beat i dont want to be ashamed of that
i dont want to have to make excuses for that
beat and i wanted to tell you
i bought your present wholesale from a friend
i didnt even pay tax on it
you dont need someone cheap like that
beat by the way its a non refundable item its scratched on the bottom
beat are you smiling
i hope youre smiling
beat ill see you at the store
a long silence
then we hear anna gently hang up
malcolm leans back against an old radiator
his eyes close as the sound of his wifes footsteps rises up the the house is silent
cole is in his pajamas asleep on the floor of the tent
curled up next to him is sebastian
they sleep surrounded by statues and pictures
coles eyes open as he hears his mothers distant voice
beat cole whats happening
cole quickly gets up and rushes out of the tent
his foot catches one of the chairs the tent is fastened to
he stumbles out
he doesnt realize one of the bedsheets comes loose
it folds to the ground
he doesnt stop as he moves through the shadowy hall and pushes open his mothers bedroom door
cole stands in the doorway to his mothers bedroom
he looks over the room carefully
everything is still
lynns room is sparse
no paintings no accessaries
a bed without a frame sits in the corner
a table with a sewing machine fills the other side of the room
his mothers voice turns his attention back to the bed
cole whats happening to you
cole looks down and finds his mother laying in her bed
her face contorted in deep sadness as she speaks in her sleep
is someone hurting you
ill beat their asses
cole smiles at his mother as he moves to her side
touches her face with his tiny fingers
whispers momma you sleep now
his touch seems to have an effect
lynn becomes still in her sleep
cole watches her carefully
cole closes the door to his mothers bedroom shut
he stands still in the hallway
lets out a heavy sigh
coles brow furrows
he breathes again
this time intentionally
watches as his breath materializes in the suddenly ice cold air
every muscle in coles eight year old body becomes rigid
he takes a second before moving through the inky darkness of the hall
cole hurries to fix his tent
he ties the collapsed bedsheet in a knot on the edge of the chair
he checks it carefully before entering the tent
when cole turns around he stops breathing
an eight year old girl vomits on herself in his tent
she finishes and looks up at cole with drawn eyes
im feeling much better now
the girl reaches out with her withered and emaciated hands tiny tubes hang from her wrists
she scratches cole as he tumbles back terrified out of the tent
the whole tent collapses cole runs hard out of his bedroom and down the hall to the living room
he gets down to the ground and slides under the wooden legged couch
sebastian is already huddled in fear under the couch
cole presses as far back as he can and waits
is of the living room floor
coffee table base
everything is still
cole holds his breath
he takes his first short breaths and watches the room for any sign of movement
a few minutes later
cole is now standing in his doorway
he stares at the hunched figure covered by the collapsed tent
cole makes a decision
he looks like he is going to cry fights it back
he walks towards it
reaches down and slowly pulls the sheet off the figure
the girl vomits one more time before looking up at cole
im feeling much better
cole and the little girl stare silently at each other
cole holds her stare with trembling eyes
he opens his mouth it takes a while before the words come out
do you want to tell me something
a downtown septa public bus
malcolm and cole are among the spattering of passengers
theyre both wearing suits
cole leans his head against the glass of the scratched window
coles large eyes drink in the passing scenery
a dark abandoned building stretches for an entire block on one side
a man in a grey full bodied uniform my names not sullivan
cole jerks back from the window
the bus quietly drives past the old prison building
cole stares down at his lap and tries not to look up anymore
she came a long way to visit me didnt she
i guess she did
cole falls into deep thoughts as he stares down at his dress shoes
malcolm slips back into silence
the city bus slithers through the old philadelphia streets working its way downtown
a modest home sits on a corner
its small lawn groomed carefully
rows of parked cars spill out from the driveway onto the streets
people in suits and dark dresses move somberly in and out of the front door of the home
cole and malcolm join the visitors as they walk slowly towards the doors
a frail little girl about four years of age sits in a dark dress on the swings in front of the house
visitors say hello to her as they pass
she doesnt say anything back
her little sister
cole nods yes
malcolm and cole watch her for a moment before following others into the modest corner home
the home is packed with people
the gathering of mourners is standing room only
the air is filled with dozens of hushed can you imagine being a child in a bed for two years
we move to
i think it was six
we move to
six separate doctors
we move to
whispers the little ones falling ill now
we move to
god help them
a family portrait hangs near the front door
two girls one bigger one smaller sit on the ground in front of their mother and father
their smiling faces welcome the mourners
malcolm and cole are standing at the bottom of a staircase
the front door opens as another group arrives
malcolm nods to cole as the foyer fills up
the two of them quietly disappear upstairs
the narrow hall is lined with boxes of medical supplies
stands sterile needles and pads are in the process of being taken away
the boxes are piled outside a closed bedroom door
cole stares at the shut door like he doesnt want to go in
his eyes move to the large colorful map of the world that dons the hallway wall
he gazes at the many countries and continents
i wish i were somewhere else
soft where will you go where no one has died
cole stares at the map and then turns to malcolm
dont go home okay
i definitely wont
cole turns and stares quietly at the door
he waits a long time before reaching for the doorknob
cole closes the door behind him
he turns and gazes at the girls bedroom
theres a hospital bed near the window
the walls are covered with get well cards and drawings from family friends and school children
her shelves are filled with puppets
all shapes and sizes of puppets
next to the shelf is a puppet stage and a camcorder on a mini tripod sitting next to it
cole walks to the shelf and picks up a finger puppet dancer
he places it in his pocket
on the girls desk is a large collection of video cassettes
the labels read puppet show christmas puppet show birthday party puppet show class trip
cole reads the labels carefully before moving towards the closets
he passes the bed
cole jerks back startled
he watches as the girls hand slips back under the bed
cole stays very still
he slowly bends down
his hands touch the floor
he tilts his head and looks under the bed
the emaciated little girl who came to his tent lays curled on the floor
her bulging eyes glare at cole
she moves suddenly
thrusts a jewelry box forward
it slides across the wooden floor and stops just before cole
cole and the sickly girl stare at each other
neither of them say a word
the room is thick with mourners
most are gathered around the girls mother a young woman in her late twenties
as she moves through the room to the kitchen she receives the many cards hugs and flowers that are offered as condolence
collins leaves the living room
malcolm watches breathlessly from the doorway as cole moves through the many adults across the room
the girls father mr
collins a thin man in his late twenties is seated on the reading chair next to a t
his face is granite
no one in the room dares to talk to him
he stares statue like at an abstract point in the room
the man doesnt react
some of the guests look oddly at the little boy standing before the man
excuse me mister
the man slowly turns and looks down at the boy standing next to him
cole is very shaky
malcolm watches everything anxiously
cole stares at mr
are you kyras daddy
the mans face begins to crumble
he nods yes softly
cole holds out the jewelry box
it trembles with his hands
the father just stares at it
its for you
beat she wanted to tell you something
the father becomes very still
his eyes fill with a storm of confusion and pain
after the longest time the father reaches and gently takes the box out of coles small hands
cole begins to back away
the father gazes at cole as he melts into the crowd
cole reaches malcolm and the two then slip out of the house
the father looks down in a daze
he goes to open the jewelry box
his movements are slow and strained
he lifts the latch and open the box
collins stares at an unlabeled video cassette
people in the room start to turn as the t
collins is seated now
her fathers face forms the most heartbreaking of smiles as he watches the performance
the entire room has stopped what they were doing
we hear footsteps coming up the stairs
the puppets go limp
the entire stage gets lifted up
we see it carried away by kyra
we can view the whole bedroom now
the camera is seated on her desk in the corner
kyra climbs in bed and pretends to be sleeping when the door opens
she carries in a tray of soup and a sandwich
the crowd watches in riveted silence
the father never takes his eyes off of the screen
the image of the mother prepares the meal
she uncovers the fruit and the soup
places a straw into the drink
and then it happens
the image of the mother walks to a closet
an assortment of household cleaners and sponges are kept inside
she pulls out a bottle of floor cleaner
reads the label for the ingredients
walks back to the food tray where she unscrews the cap on the floor cleaner
the mother pours some into the cap
video tape thats too much
the mother pours some into the bottle
the remainder goes into the childs soup
she replaces the cap and puts the bottle back in the closet
the image of the mother turns to the bed carrying the tray
she places the food on a metallic rolling table and swings it over the bed
video tape kyra time for lunch
kyra pretends to wake from a deep sleep
video tape im feeling much better now
the image of the mother smiles
video tape im glad honey
beat time for your food
video tape can i go outside if i eat this
video tape well see
you know how you get sick in the afternoon
kyra picks up the spoon and takes a sip
her face crinkles at the taste
she looks up at her mother
video tape dont say it tastes funny
you know i dont like to hear that
kyra slowly brings the spoon to her mouth and swallows another spoonful
the father shuts off the television with his trembling hands
he presses his hands to his eyes like theyre burning
the room is utterly silent
collins is seated at the dining room surrounded by friends and family
she fixes one of the many bouquets of flowers on the table
it takes her a beat before she feels the stare
she looks up
standing in the doorway to the dining room is mr
a group of ashen faced guests stand in the distance behind him
husband and wifes eyes meet
collins smiles softly
collins eyes tremble with tears
soft you were keeping her sick
the whole world stops
the mothers face registers confusion at first
then slow realization
her eyes glace at the many faces around her
she looks back at her husband
his glare is painful
rage filling every cell of his body
tears falling faster down his cheeks
collins turns her attention back to the flowers
she concentrates with all her strength
her hands begin to shake
to no one i took care of her
her words are met with ice cold stares
the first tears stream down her face
the pretty flowers of consolation in her hand tumble to the floor
cole sits on the swings next to kyras four year old sister
she doesnt look up
malcolm waits in the driveway
watches them from a distance
cole reaches into his pocket and pulls out the little finger puppet
he holds it out
you liked it she said
the four year old stares at the finger puppet then quietly takes it in her small hands
the two children dont say anything for a while
malcolm glances to the house where all movements in and out of the home has ceased
cole turns to the four year old
she watched out for you
the little girl finally looks up
she has the saddest eyes
kyras not coming back
the little girl stares down at the finger puppet
cole lightly places a hand on her shoulder
nothing else is said
nothing else is done
malcolm looks across the two children on the swings
malcolm takes it in overwhelmed
stanley cunningham moves between two curtains and comes to a prop room door in the back
he puts an ear to the door listens and then knocks
after a second he enters
cunningham finds cole sitting in a poor villager costume as a female teacher kneels next to him and makes final adjustments
cole and the woman glance at mr
theyre calling for the stable boy
cunningham looks around the room and then directly at cole
who were you talking to
the female teacher looks to cole and nods
she stands up
the entire left side of her face has been burnt horribly
my favorite student
cole puts on his tattered hat
thanks for giving me this part mr
youre welcome cole
they share a look before walking out of the prop room and entering the hall
we see them walking away
you know when i was in school there was a terrible fire in this section of the theater
they rebuilt the whole thing
it begins to rain
malcolm pulls his jacket over his head as he scurries up the stairs of the school
malcolm stands and catches his breath in the corridor of st
a teacher rushes in the hall with an armload of costumes
has the play started yet
the teacher hurries past malcolm and down the hall without saying a word
is that a yes
the teacher scurries around a corner
malcolm watches her curiously
malcolm moves quickly to a set of double doors and opens them
he steps into the darkness of the auditorium
the play is in full swing
cole and a large group of costumed children are on stage
cole holds a broom and wears a worn down costume
he stands to the side hidden by others
a boy in a shiny armored costume walks to the center of the stage where a large cardboard stone is seated
a sparkling handle sticks out of the top
the armored boy tries to lift it
it wont budge
bobby the chubby boy from the party is dressed in a magicians costume
he is merlin
he steps forward
only he who is pure of heart can take the sword from the stone
merlin looks to the group on stage
looks right at cole
let the boy try
the group of villagers on the stage laugh and mock the suggestion
tommy tammisimo is dressed in a mismatched costume he hops around clearly embarrassed
half heartedly but hes the stable boy
he cleans after the horses
silence village idiot
let the boy step forward
tommy turns a deep shade of red and hobbles off the stage
merlin looks to cole
he smiles a true friends smile
not because hes acting
he really hesitates
it takes him a moment before he steps forward
cole steps up to the stone
he places his hand around the handle
begins to pull
the sword starts to come out
the villagers gasp
cole raises the shiny sword out of the stone and high above his head
merlin and everyone on stage bows
a silence fills the malcolm watches his client standing unafraid in the spot light for the first time
the villagers rise and rush to cole
they scoop him up and carry him around the stage in celebration
cole chuckles and then starts laughing as the group of eight year olds try unsuccessfully to keep him up
they slowly sag and then collapse
all the students are laughing as they try to untangle themselves
malcolm watches with utter joy as cole becomes indistinguishable among of a group of twenty children giggling and enjoying themselves on stage
the rain comes down a little stronger now on the stained glass window
malcolm sits on the stairs in the lobby
cole walks back and forth in front of him
cole still holds the sword from the play
how come were so quiet
malcolm shrugs his shoulders
i think we said everything we needed to say
beat maybe its time to say things to someone else
someone close to you
cole keeps moving
im not going to see you anymore am i
malcolm doesnt respond for a while
he shakes his head no
you were great in the play cole
and you know what else
tommy tammisimo sucked big time
cole smiles huge
coles sword drags on the tile as he continues to circle around the hall
we get the idea he doesnt want to be still
maybe we can pretend were going to see each other tomorrow
cole glances at malcolm
just for pretend
malcolm exhales very slowly as he gets up
okay cole im going to go now
ill see you tomorrow
cole watches as malcolm walks down the stairs to the entrance
cole stops moving
soft see you tomorrow
malcolms face shows his losing battle against his emotions
he doesnt turn to look back
a rain soaked bridge
a two lane road merges to one lane around a severe car accident
a rear ended car has jumped the sidewalk and hit the guard rail of the bridge
the driver is helped out by police
hes shaken but okay
police flares guide the cars as they crawl by
lynn and cole are standing still in bumper to bumper traffic
lynn leans her chin on the steering wheel
she tries to stare through the layer of water on the glass
she hits the windshield wipers
i hope nobody got hurt
lynn glances over to cole who sits in his seat silently
youre very quiet
beat youre mad i missed the play arent you
cole shakes his head no
i have two jobs baby
you know how important they are for us
id give anything to have been there
im ready to communicate with you now
tell you my secrets
the way he says the words gives lynn a chill
what is it
cole takes a long time
you know that accident up there
someone got hurt
oh my god
lynn leans over the steering wheel
she wipes the windshield with her palm to see better
you can see her
lynn gazes out the windshield at the line of red tail lights
where is she
standing next to my window
lynn looks over slowly
she doesnt see anything outside his window
she eyes cole
cole youre scaring me
they scare me too sometimes
you see ghosts cole
they want me to do things for them
they talk to you
cole nods yes
they tell you to do things
cole nods yes again
lynn becomes upset
she nods with grave understanding
cole watches her
what are you thinking momma
i dont know
you think im a freak
lynns eyes moves to cole
look at my face
cole gazes at her intense expression
i would never think that about you ever
cole smiles a tiny smile
lynn glances down
just let me think for a second
she drowns in her thoughts
grandma says hi
lynn looks up sharply
she says shes sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant
she just likes it a lot
grandma comes to visit me sometimes
lynn becomes still
her face is unreadable
when she speaks her words are extremely controlled
cole thats very wrong
you know that
she wanted me to tell you soft cole please stop
she wanted me to tell you she saw you dance
lynns eyes lock on coles
she said when you were little you and her had a fight right before your dance recital
you thought she didnt come to see you dance
lynn brings her hands to her mouth
she hid in the back so you wouldnt see
she said you were like an angel
lynn begins to cry
she said you came to her where they buried her
asked her a question
she said the answer is everyday
lynn covers her face with her hands
the tears roll out through her fingers
whispers what did you ask
lynn looks at her son
she barely gets the words out
crying do i make her proud
cole moves closer to lynn
she cradles him in her arms
mother and son hold each other tight
malcolm walks quietly down the sidewalk towards his home
malcolm enters the living room and smiles at what he sees
anna is asleep in a chair
shes curled up in a ball
in a way she looks like a little girl
their wedding video plays softly on the television
malcolm watches himself and anna cutting their wedding cake
the malcolm turns from the television and takes a seat next to anna
he gazes upon his wife softly
whispers anna ive been so lost
beat i need my best friend
malcolm gazes for a beat before looking down
i miss you
malcolms eyes move back up
he looks at his sleeping wife
malcolm cant believe it
i miss you
her lips move again
eyes never open
what did i do
whats made you so sad
why did you leave me
i didnt leave you
she becomes silent
anna falls back into deep sleep her arm slides down
something shiny falls out and rolls on the malcolms eyes watch as it comes to a stop
he gazes curiously at a gold wedding band laying on the wood floor
confusion washes over his face
he looks to annas hand
an identical gold wedding ring sits on her finger
malcolm looks down at his own hand
his wedding ring is malcolm is completely lost
he takes a couple steps back
looks around in confusion
his eyes come to rest on the door to his basement office
he looks in disbelief at the set of dead bolt locks on the door
malcolm doesnt know what the hells going on
his eyes are drawn to the dining table
only one place setting is out on the tabletop
his eyes search again they finally lock on the wedding video playing
malcolm watches images of himself on the screen
his eyes fill with a storm of emotions
malcolm looks to annas face and becomes very still
like hes falling down a deep hole no
anna rushes across the room to a crumpled malcolm laying on the floor
malcolms hands are clutched at his side
anna pries his hands away to reveal the tiniest tear in his shirt
annas eyes catch something dark moving
a pool of blood is forming under malcolm
she slowly turns him over on his side
a horrific sight
an enormous exit wound on his lower back pours out blood uncontrollably
malcolms jaw is locked open
his breaths are long and strained
malcolms open jaw releases a long strained breath and then becomes silent
anna tries to cover the wound with her hands desperately
screaming anna just sleeps
malcolm staggers back
his breathing erratic
he takes a seat across from her
he looks at his wife and suddenly becomes very still
annas still curled up asleep but tears are falling from her shut eyes
anna doesnt move but her tears seem to fall a little faster
i think i have to go
malcolms mind is racing
realizing i just needed to do a couple of things
beat and i needed to tell you something
you were never second
malcolm gazes at his wife
tears fall from both their eyes
you sleep now anna
everything will be different in the morning
anna lays still
the room falls into silence
malcolm sits still across from his wife
he drinks her in with his eyes
malcolm leans back in the chair
slowly closes his eyes
they close shut
we pull back to reveal anna alone in the living room
on tape i think ive had too much to drink
malcolm smiles as he takes a sip
the guests chuckle as they watch
on tape i just have to say this day today has been one very special day
i wish we all could stay and play
the crowd erupts in laughter
on tape what
malcolm looks around at everyones smiling faces
malcolm takes his time
he looks just past the camera
anna i never thought id feel the things im feeling
i never thought id be able to stand up in front of my friends and family and tell them whats inside me
today i can
malcolms eyes fill with water
softly anna crowe
i am in love
in love i am
