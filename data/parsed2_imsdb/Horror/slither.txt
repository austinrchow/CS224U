written by james gunn september closeup a slender womans hand writes on a chalkboard in teacherly cursive
we pull back to reveal starla grant a stunningly beautiful southern woman in her twenties as she finishes writing out survival of the fittest starla glances at the classroom of
high school students
she is a demure woman somewhat awkward in her speaking but she has the rapt attention of all the boys in the class
when darwin said fittest he didnt necessarily mean the strongest or the most intelligent or any one trait he merely meant those organisms most well suited to their environment
the boys in the class look her up and down as she speaks
kylie strutemyer a pretty student notices a boy beside her drawing starla only without her clothes
she hits him
we humans think were more fit more evolved because were smarter
but were neophytes
weve been around two million years give or take
the cockroach has been here for million
you tell me whos the more successful species
a boy raises his hand
hows all this go with how the bible says there aint no dinosaurs
some of the kids laugh at the boy
starla pauses about to answer when the bell rings
well tackle that tomorrow
everyone bring your boxing gloves
the kids start to leave
celebratory banners are strung over this street including one that reads deer season starts today
were in the center of wheelsy south carolina a moderately depressed small town
todays a big day as hunters from far and near crowd the streets in their massive pickups
men spill in and out of a gun store buying loads of ammunition
old hunters with faces like prunes stand outside angells tavern getting drunk
a man with few teeth has a dead deer strung out across the back of his truck skinning the carcass its innards spilling loose
jack an older uptight man in fancy clothes is driving through town in his big old cadillac
he comes upon a hunters truck double parked jamming up traffic
jack jams on his horn
get the fuck out of the way cocksucker
jack turns to see a mother and her two children on the sidewalk listening and staring in shock
jack smiles a bit embarrassed
jack notices a group of hunters on the sidewalk looking and pointing at something up in the sky
he looks up to see a small meteor plummeting toward earth
students file out of the open door for the day
kylie starlas pretty student is among them
she and her friend are looking up at the falling meteor
prolly go find it later sell it on ebay
a rancher with a cleft palate turns his head to see the meteor much closer to him
its rushing down toward the treetops of a nearby forest
a framed wedding photograph of a very young starla and a large man is sitting on a desk
the photo trembles lightly with the impact of the meteor hitting the earth
grant grant a large indelicate man in his mid forties notices the photos on his desk moving
he looks up from his desk and out his door where theres a glass workshop
two workers are carrying a large pane of glass looking relieved they didnt drop it
just a tremor boys
grant goes back to filling out the tags of file folders with a sharpie
four cops bill pardy the towns young relaxed and handsome chief of police wally an older toad like cop trevor a younger somewhat goofy cop and margaret a mannish cop
are standing stock still in the station parking lot
did ya feel that
they enter the station
the four cops start to remove their holsters and so forth finished for the day
i always get afraid when that happens cause what if the ground cracks open and you fall inside
its so hot in there you get all burnt to nothin like that snaps happened to my uncle barry
wally and bill laugh at him
who told you that story trevor
your uncle barry left her for a stripper up in winnsboro
trevor looks shocked sad
shelby a slightly dim dispatcher on his headset at the police operators unit swirls toward them alarmed
we got a mergency over at the diner
the four cops move in
theres a commotion
most of the patrons are standing
back there bill
the waitress nods back through the service window into the kitchen where a large doe is hopping around
a dishwasher stands on the counter yelping with fear
bill wally trevor margaret and the waitress enter
the doe skips around
she slipped in was eating trash
we seen it on tv how they kill ya right
so we thought we best call in
bill spots the open rear door and tries to herd the deer toward it
come on now honey doors this way
its open season
lets shoot her
shes just scared margaret
also bill likes to take a female through the back door any chance he gets
wally and margaret laugh
trevor snatches a dish towel and rushes the doe using it like a cape
the scared doe leaps away from him jumping onto the kitchen counter
she aint a bull trevor
the animal kicks off a pot which hits margaret
goddamn bambi rat
as the doe jumps to the floor she gets her hoof wrapped in a telephone cord
the cord is plugged into the wall trapping the doe in place
wally margaret and trevor attempt to dive for the cord but cant avoid the does crazy flying hooves
the other cops step away
bill steps slowly toward the doe speaking calmly
its okay sweetheart
nobodys gonna hurt you
the doe looks at him settling a bit
his voice seems to be soothing her
bill gets closer
just gonna pull this cord out
its gonna be all right
the cops and restaurant folk look on in awe as the doe breathing heavily becomes still
bill scoops close past her and yanks the telephone cord out of the wall
then the doe runs forward almost knocking bill over and streaks out the back door
bill wally margaret and trevor move up to the doorway and watch the deer skitter off into the woods beyond dragging the telephone tied to her leg
hell she took a phone
now them forest critters are gonna be calling us all hours of the night
wally pretends to be on the phone
chief of police there
this a squirrel
bring me a bag of peanuts motherfucker
everyone laughs some more
grant locks his office for the day
his secretary sees him going
see ya ashley
grant walks across the workshop toward the door
he sees a crowd of workers lounging around a glass cutting table laughing at something
some of them nod at grant and he nods back
but hes completely outside their circle
a sizable two story suburban home
all the lights are off but one
so i get home today phones ringing
its hank wilcox
starla and grant eat dinner in this well decorated room
as grant chatters starla occasionally smiles politely at him
callin for you
what the hell
i said hank thats a little bit outta line dontcha think a single man callin someones wife
at night nonetheless
starla is quiet almost afraid
hes teaching environmental science grant
probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester
oh yeah thats what he wants to borrow this guy
its just a work thing
work thing hell starla
he just wants to get in your pussy
him and most these other ones around here
thats where their minds is at them sick fucks
grant takes a big bite of food stuffing his mouth
ill tell you sugarplum youre lucky you got me
youre too damn trusting
without me to protect you youd get kilt one of these days
starla stares at herself in the mirror as she brushes her hair
she uses long slow strokes as if stalling
sugarplum you coming into bed
starla turns toward the door
she doesnt say anything for a moment
just a second
starla sets her brush down on the counter
she arranges it neatly beside the others
and walks into the bedroom
grant turns off the tv as starla gets into bed with him
its almost completely dark in here
grant crawls on top of starla
he kisses her and grabs her in a way not meant to be rough but is utterly without grace
after doing this for a few moments starla starts to push him off her
grant no im sorry im just im not in the mood
grant is on top of her breathing a little too heavy
come on baby its im sorry
i dont just have some switch
sure you do
through starlas nightgown grant pretends to flick one of her nipples
then the other
grant peeved gets off of her
he sits on the edge of the bed for a moment in silence
starla looks afraid
when are you in the mood exactly
seems to me that moods as rare as winnin the goddamn lotto
grant grabs his slacks off the valet and starts putting them on
where are you going
im just some big clown to you aint i
thats not true where are you
grant sits at the bar knocking back a shot of tequila
hes getting drunk
he taps his glass
hit me again there killer
the barkeep fills his drink
hey grant hows it you come to have the same last name as first
parents thought it sounded pleasant i spose
joke on me aint it
grant notices a woman with a lot of makeup brenda gutierrez staring at him from across the bar smoking a cigarette
grant stares at her trying to figure out who she is
she slides off her stool
she sashays toward him
she props herself on the stool beside him leans drunkenly in toward him
megan halesy little sister
youre kidding me
hell you were grant holds his hand only so high
and ill tell you somethin grant grant
is in love with you
grant stares at her
my sister megan shes a big fat cow
was then even more so now
id be thinking whatd you see in her aint in me
shit girl you couldnta been eleven
hell i was game
so does grant
he stares at her contemplating sinful things
he nods at her wedding ring
whos the lucky fella
never marry a damn half mexican
married a gal named starla covington
dont be ignorant
everyone knows that
fucking prom queen
grant finishes his drink and gets up to go
where you goin
grant speaks more loudly than need be starla she gets real worried bout me i stay out too late
loves me too much that one
he glances around to see if people have heard and stumbles out
grant sits on a boulder beside a creek looking miserable downing a six pack
he throws an empty can into the creek when he glances down and sees particles flowing down the river
grant slides off the boulder
he kneels and examines the particles
they shimmer in the moonbeams coming down between the trees
grant peers up the creek from where the particles are coming
he sees a gap on the edge of the creek where water splashes and is diverted in streamlets down the hill
he approaches the spot and comes upon a small crater on the side of the creek
the meteorite is inside the crater but its cracked into pieces
the rock seems almost organic like a shell
the shimmery specks are part of the shell itself flecking off into the creek and rushing downstream
he touches the meteorite and feels some sort of goo inside it
he notices a strip of the same slime leading out of the crater itself and into the woods
grant curiously slowly follows the slimy trail
he comes to a flurry of colorful wild flowers
something is rustling the flowers ever so slightly
he moves in closer
a gelatinous yellow organism slithers sluggishly between the flowers
the organism is a mound a few inches high gross and veiny yet as colorful as the flowers around it
a small cavity on the apex of the organism constricts and expands lightly
i guess its not worth keeping secret that this thing looks a tad like a bright yellow vagina
grant is a little freaked out by this thing even frightened
he looks around for someone else
hey anybody round here
no one answers
grant looks down at the organism unsure
he picks up a tree branch
grant softly prods the organism with the pointy end of the branch
he does it again
the thing pulses a little and surges toward grant
grand pokes it again
a small thin quill a spore emerges from the cavity in the center of the organism
the spore is quivering and as it trembles upward little bulbed spurs pop up as well
grant slowly bends down to look at it when
the spore suddenly shoots out
it strikes grant in the stomach
grant yanks up his shirt looking at a wound on his abdomen
he watches as the spore quivers and disappears inside him
he clutches his stomach screams in agony
he falls back into the colorful flowers
his body convulses
we see the insides of grants body as if sliced in half
we zoom in on the little spore which is jittering up through his body and into his neck
the spore keys into the base of grants cerebellum and his entire brain crackles with a white electrical energy
grant freezes in place his fingers contorted up in front of him silent
hes utterly still a wax corpse
a hippie camping couple run into the area looking for the source of the screams
the man looks down at the frozen grant
the camper crouches down beside him
you all right
the camper turns from grant to his girlfriend
i think hes d grant gasps suddenly sitting up and grabbing the man like a drowning man popping up above water
the camper yelps and jumps back
grant sweats and heaves trying to speak but hardly can its taking
grants eyes glaze over and he eases off
he heaves there momentarily confused
his eyes dart around as if seeing his surroundings for the first time
you all right man
grant looks down curiously at the camper
then he turns and stumbles away from them out of the forest
that might of been a stroke buddy
you better take it easy
grant drives down the road in his luxury pickup truck sweating and blinking rapidly
grant steps out of the truck in his driveway when he hears hey ya grant
grant swings his head toward his neighbor who is taking a happy beagle for a morning walk
what were ya night fishing again
you catch anything
i caught a little somethin yeah
grant walks inside his house
grant looks around the foyer
grant creeps into the bedroom looking around
we can hear the shower running
grant spots his face in a mirror above the dresser
he moves in close to the mirror and stares at his own image
he pulls on his face a little his eyes brimming with excitement
he smiles at himself
grant looks toward the open bathroom door where he hears the running shower
he creeps toward it
grant peeks around the doorway
starla is in the shower soaping herself
she looks beautiful there
grant tilts his head to the side like a dog
he watches her mesmerized even moved
starla is wearing a white towel and brushing her wet hair in the foggy bathroom mirror when she hears air supplys every woman in the world coming from the bedroom
shes struck by it
she moves toward the door
the shades are drawn darkening the room
a few candles have been lit
grant is standing there mostly in silhouette
hes silent and he doesnt move
hey there sugarplum
starla looks at him stirred
havent heard this for a while
grant walks toward her
he takes her hand in his own lifting it beside him
he wraps his other arm around her waist
and he slow dances with her
starla dances too a bit hesitantly a bit shy
i never danced in a towel before
wearing white just like on our
i remember it
im sorry about last night
i get a little insecure sometimes want to hold on too tight
its just cause youre precious to me starla
but i swear to god baby im turning over a new goddamn leaf
starla nods touched
grants eyes are teary
i love you sugarplum
starla and grant kiss tenderly
grant falls to his knees in front of her
he runs his hand over the curve of her hip her thigh her buttock with as much fascination as lust
he pushes starla back onto the bed
he lifts her leg and kisses it nibbles on it a little scrapes his teeth on it
starla is surprised by this but enjoys it too its probably the most foreplay shes had in years
grant crawls on top of her runs his hands over her breasts her face
starlas hand moves over grants back and to his stomach
when she stops startled
grant whats that
she gazes down at the wound between them on grants bare abdomen where the spore entered him
the wound is yellowish and surrounded by veins
grant embarrassed pulls his shirt down
just a little bug bite is all
grant kisses and munches on starla as she lies back on the bed enjoying it
starla is humming every woman in the world as she drops coins into a soda machine and chooses tab
janene a heavyset black teacher notices this
what are you so smiley about girl
starla grabs her soda and sits down with janene
janene just stares
just grant and i had a nice morning
its been a while
you got that fresh fucked glow dont you
youre a married woman
maybe this is the start of a real change in grant
grant is holding up his shirt and looking at his torso
the wound on his side is blackened and gangrenous and is starting to puff up into a veiny little spout
a fuzzy bluish moss is growing in the crevices around the spout
a pus oozes out
grant looks concerned
he squirts some neosporin onto his fingers
he massages it slowly into the wound
grant opens the refrigerator door and rummages around inside
he pulls out some bread
he opens the meat drawer
its replete with cold cuts
he pulls out some oscar mayer baloney
pastrami and salami
he grabs every type of meat there is
grant assembles a sandwich at the table
two pieces of bread and some cheese
he starts putting the meat on
but he cant stop piling more and more on until he has a little sandwich tower
he looks at it
something seems off about it
he removes the cheese
and then the bread
he stares at what is now simply a tower of cold cuts
after contemplating it for a moment grant stands and carries off the pile of meat
grant enters the garage through a door from the foyer
he flips the lights on with his shoulder
he looks around
grant spots an old file cabinet
he sets the tower of meat down on the oily floor and opens a drawer
its filled with files
he closes that drawer and opens another
it has manila file folders but no files
grant takes out the folders
he uses a sharpie to write out baloney on a folder
then he stuffs all the baloney into the folder and files it away
he starts writing out pastrami
grant flips through his alphabetically filed meat from baloney through turkey
but he doesnt look satisfied
grant stands beside the butchers counter with a shopping cart
he peers dreamily in through the glass at the rows of steaks pork chops and so on
you goin to the deer cheer this weekend
grant snaps out of his reverie
sure thing killer
what can i do you for
thinkin bout getting me a couple of these big ol rib eyes
how many you need
grant stares at the steaks
having us a little dinner party
the butcher nods starts to grab steaks
hell what am i holding back for
why dont you just give me everything you got here
all the rib eyes
and while youre at it get me a few of them chicken wings
some pork loins
and ooo whats this here
grant backs his pickup toward the garage
meat is piled into the bed
wrapped packages of meat fill the seats around him
grant stands in the garage tearing open the packing and letting the loose meat slide into piles onto the floor muttering meat
grant rolls slabs of beef over the dirty floor and into a pile
something skitters across the garage and around the pile
grant peers around the pile and sees a rat nibbling on some ribs
he realizes something
the rat moves away from grant
but grant snaps out his arm with alarming speed snatching the rat
it squeaks and wriggles in his grip tearing and biting at him trying to get free
grant snaps its neck and tosses the dead rat onto the pile of meat
starla pulls into the driveway
she presses the button on her garage door opener
the door shudders but stays closed
she gets out of the car and examines the door
she looks down and sees a new padlock locking the door to the cement driveway with bolts on both sides
starla enters the house
she heads toward a door along the wall that leads to the garage
theres a shiny new lock on that door as well
she touches it baffled
she turns to see grant standing at the end of the foyer
hes in shadows a little spooky in the darkness
why are there did you put locks on the garage
you drilled into the driveway
grant walks into the light
i just got so excited about
youre my princess arent you
i got a super special birthday present for you this year
i couldnt risk you finding it so i had to put them locks on the doors
i have to clean up before dinner
grant smiles at her
starla confused tries to smile back then turns and heads up the stairs
grant watches starlas fine form from behind somewhat lustily
but his leering gaze gradually turns into something darker and he has a realization
grant snaps himself out of it
see you in a sec
starla smiles uneasily and heads on upstairs
grant steps onto the front porch to get some air
hes blinking and seems a little dizzy
he gazes around the neighborhood down the way a boy in a little league uniform and his mother get out of their car and walk toward the front door
across the street through a kitchen window a plump man and his wife are eating dinner
at another home a short man steps on a stepladder changing the dome light on his porch
grant stares at these individuals looking like an animal ready to lunge at its prey fighting the urge
he hears a barking
grant turns to see the beagle next door tied to the tree yapping at him
grant looks around to make sure no ones watching
starla walks to get the paper in her robe and she sees a boy aged thirteen or so stapling a lost reward flyer to a telephone pole with a picture
of the beagle
the boys face is streaked from a long night of crying
you havent seen him have you
starla shakes her head
im sure hell show up tim
the boy nods and walks to the next telephone pole to put up another flyer
grant moves up a hill between trees looking around for something
he comes to a stop trying to remember which way to go
he does and moves on
grant comes upon an old wooden barn
the structure is maybe a hundred years old and long abandoned
its spattered with graffiti
grant stares at it
grant gathers large fronds and other foliage in his arms
grant spreads the plant life over the floor of the barn
he arranges it fluffs it there
his actions are very animal like when no ones around
he seems to be making a nest
he sits back looks at it
starla dressed in her weekend finery is looking in the mirror above her dresser and putting on earrings
grant are you almost ready
grant looks ill
he is leaning over the sink sweating clutching his stomach
yeah hon ill be right there
grant turns and pushes open his door
grant sees starla sitting on the edge of the bed her back to him as she puts on her nylons
she doesnt know hes there
grant stares at her demented and moves slowly toward her stalking her
something starts to push grants shirt up at his stomach like a bellybutton erection
the thing slips out of his shirt a writhing pointy tubule aiming toward starlas back
grant looks at the nape of starlas neck
her delicate ear
he becomes confused he softens
starla turns to see grant his body now turned away from her
hes trying to push the tubule back down
what are you doing
starla nods confused by his behavior
a banner hangs across the front of the lodge deer cheer the first friday of deer season in wheelsy
inflatable deer totems decorate the front of the wooden lodge
rambunctious music comes from inside
grant and starla step out of his truck
as they do one of starlas students will sees her and waves
starla waves back
grant notices this and grabs starlas arm a bit too hard pulling her back
its just one of my students grant
grant stares at the boy with distrust and ushers starla towards the lodge
bill trevor and margaret are hanging out on a large rock outside the entranceway drinking beer
bill watches grant and starla cross the lot
trevor sees this
whats she see in that douchebag
thats the mystery of the ages there trev
starla was seventeen when they got engaged
he was like in his thirties
no one even knew they were goin out till she had that ring on her finger
aint no mystery to it
shes raised in them shanties off st
gold digger huh
hell you dont know that margaret
margaret shrugs belches
jack the mayor with his wife stops beside them after she does staring at her
bill youre chief of police now
comes with some goddamn responsibility like keeping your people in line
youre right jack
margaret youre fired
margaret and trevor laugh
jack shakes his head with disdain and enters the party
wheelsy citizens celebrate
a country western band plays
couples two step
starla and grant move through the party
grant looks around at the dancing and laughing bodies
starla sees her friend from school
janene laughs heartily and the two embrace hey grant
why dont you two catch up
ill go see what the boys are doing
she and janene watch as grant moves off through the crowd
hes been strange the past couple days
grant steps outside and looks around
across the parking lot is a playground
two young children are spinning on a little carousel there
grant starts toward them
the children giggle unaware of grant inching up on them
grant gets closer excited when he hears
hey there handsome
grant turns and see brenda gutierrez standing there
once again shes very drunk
must be fate us meeting again like this
well you might be right
grant sees if anyones watching
he circles around her
youre lookin awful pretty
wheres the old half mexican
took the kids to his moms for the weekend
grant holds brendas hand and he pulls her between the trees
where you takin me you bad boy
grant stops in a secluded place beside the creek looking around
no ones there
he turns toward her smiles
take off your shirt doll
brenda looks at him confused
guess its hard to explain how amazin a human brain is to someone who thats all they know
stuff you can never imagine
im inclined to parlay it into somethin more
so go ahead there beautiful and take off your shirt
brenda though startled leans back on a boulder and starts unbuttoning her blouse
after a moment she looks at grant trying to be sexy while she does it
grant looks at her in her bra
grant unbuttons his shirt as well
as he removes it completely he turns toward her
brenda sees the wound on his stomach has blossomed into a veiny blue moss encrusted yellow spout huge and pulsing
grant grabs her
she tries to push his arms away
no no we brenda gets up trying to run away
but grant grabs her necklace yanking her back
the necklace snaps and falls into the creek beside them
grant pins brendas wrists against the rock
she struggles to get free
brendas eyes widen as she looks down to see the writhing tentacle like tubule emerge from grants wound
she grant shoves his hand over her mouth shutting her up
hes extremely strong
she watches as the tubule twitches feeling its way like a blind snake
the tubule comes to rest on her abdomen
tears stream down from brendas eyes
it pushes into her flesh
brenda goes into convulsions
something a fluid pumps through the tubule and into brenda
grant watches brenda without emotion as her body spasms there beside him
then she falls back unconscious
the tubule retracts into grants torso
starla is leaning over a wooden rail looking at the lights of the town below
she turns to see bill lean on the rail beside her
she looks genuinely happy
starla catches herself and looks around to see if grant is watching
the lurker aint around
thats not funny
tryin to get a buzz on
but im too buff
too much muscle mass
what you up to
just checking out the lights
bill and starla look out over the city together
pretty aint they
i dont know
ive seen them so many times before
i guess any spot gets boring after awhile
well thats only if youre in the wrong spot
starla looks at him
theres a place over there on the bluffs
when the fog is just right like tonight the lights of main look like a kaleidoscope
but only a few folks know how to get there
rollo linkski coulda taken you but course he got hit by that train
ill get wally to show me sometime then
starla laughs out loud
so does bill
oh will you now
or rollos ghost
they turn to see grant approaching
hes a mess
his pants are streaked with mud
grant whered you go
grant eyes bill with suspicion
he grabs starla
you ready sugarplum
she looks at bill and mouths bye
bill watches grant and starla head off as he downs the rest of his beer
wally walks up beside him
surprised youre able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long
glad youre here
there was something i wanted to tell you
bill snaps his fingers trying to remember
fuck you fat ass
they both laugh
starla lies on her side awake
shes staring at the dirt on grants pants which are hung over a valet
grant holds her from behind sleeping peacefully
the front door of the precinct opens and a confused mexican man walks inside
he is trying to keep from crying
three half naked children follow him clutching onto his clothes
the man walks slowly through the office looking around for help
margaret sees him from her desk
sir may i help
my wife brenda
i think something has happened to her
starla in her car with groceries comes to a stop sign
she looks at the telephone pole beside it and sees that its covered with flyers for missing pets
starla enters with a shopping bag
the lights are off
creepy music plays
starla tries to turn on the lights but nothing happens
she passes the door to the garage noticing the lock
starla sets down the bags on the counter looks around
again no ones here
she sees a potted flower on the counter
a green inchworm is crawling up the stem little by little
she stares at it as if its a portent
she hears a moan coming from upstairs
starla moves slowly into this dark room looking for her husband
it seems no one is here
grant where are y
starla turns when grant pops into frame
starla startled screams
grant is sick and trembling
but worse hes been transforming
there are small pustules all over his face
oh my god
what happened to your
it aint as bad as it looks sugarplum
carl was just here
i had a reaction to a bee sting
he gave me a prescription
said i should be fine in a couple days
starla stares at him mute and horrified
dont look at me like that baby
im gonna go get my
grant grabs his keys off the dresser puts them in his pocket trying to pretend he doesnt hurt
ill get if for you
ill be right back
he moves outside the door leaving starla shell shocked
its too dark to see much in here but we do see grant putting meat into a garbage bag
grant looks around to make sure no ones looking as he places the garbage bag full of meat into his trunk closes it
grant moves through the forest in massive pain dragging the garbage bag
grant comes upon the old wooden barn
it is almost completely dark
he hears grant peers over at brenda mostly in silhouette sitting on the nest he has made
shes chained up and moans through a mouth gag
grant walks to her
her body is horribly pear shaped and misshapen like some tumorous pregnancy
grant pulls her gag away
grant im hungry
im so fuckin hungry i think im gonna die
brought you munchies
grant pours the garbage bagful of rotting meat and dead animals out in front of her
been saving for a rainy day
closeup brendas face still mostly in darkness
she stares at the meat simultaneously excited and repulsed
she looks up at grant
grant im sorry if i did something wrong
i think i gotta i think i should go to a hospital
grant doesnt respond
brendas eyes trail back down to the meat
brendas hand reaches out and grabs a maggot infested pork chop pulling it toward her
we hear but can barely see brenda chowing down on the raw pork in the nearly pitch black barn
grant gets into his pickup he trembles and yelps as his body is wracked with pain and his body starts to transform even more
theres a hard knocking on starlas door
she swings it open to see bill and wally standing there worried
wally tries to see inside
he went to the pharmacy
hes got a
bill and wally exchange a glance maybe this means something
starla can see trevor and margaret across the street talking to another neighbor
starla you know brenda gutierrez
starla shakes her head
maybe shes ever called the house or
she disappeared friday night
we got reason to believe foul play might be involved
some kids found her necklace near tipper creek as well as what might be her blood on a rock
the problem starla is the last person anyone saw her talking to was grant
starla looks at him surprised
the deer cheer
and wally and me we also saw him that night with mud all over his slacks
bill hands her his card
have him call me right away okay
starla nods distraught
bill tries to smile kindly before he and wally move out and off to canvas other neighbors homes
starla closes the door behind her distraught panicked
she looks at the foyer door leading into the garage
her eyes fall down to the floor where she sees what appears to be blood drop stains near the door
she gains courage and moves off toward starla throws open this door
she looks at old unused sports equipment
she grabs an aluminum baseball bat
starla holds the aluminum bat standing in front of the door to the garage
she hesitates a moment
but then she swings the bat at the lock on the door
she swings it again grunting
finally the lock is knocked off the wooden door
starla pushes away the useless lock letting it fall to the floor
starla steels herself and slowly pushes open the door into the dark garage
as she does the horrendous stench hits her
terrified she covers her face with her hand and enters
starla sees whats there not only a huge stockpile of rotten meat but a dozen dead pets
they are neatly divided into various categories and labeled pork ground beef cats dogs
the walls and doorway have been heavily insulated so the smell doesnt sink into the home
she looks on the floor and sees poor dead roscoe the beagle his tongue dangling out
starla starts to cry
she moves quickly back inside
starla runs to the front picture window and looks out onto the street
she cant see any of the cops
she turns from the window and picks up a cordless phone
she looks at the card bill gave her and dials the number
the phone rings and youve reached chief pardy at the wheelsy police department
please leave a message and your call will be returned as soon as possible
theres a beep
starla tries to speak through her sobs pacing bill its starla
as starla passes the large picture window she doesnt see grant staring in at her his face now that of some diseased cephalopod
its i think you better come over right away i think grants sick he
starla turns to see the monstrous grant through the window
she just stops
they stare at each other for a moment
and then grant lets out a furious wail
starla turns and dashes toward the back of the house
grant disappears from the window
as starla runs through here she looks behind her at the front door to make sure grant isnt following
she runs past a wall of family photos
starla sees the door on the rear of the house leading to the backyard
she arrives at it and flings it open grant is there
he lunges onto her
starla screams and drops the cordless phone just as it starts ringing
grant crawls on top of her body
starla reaches for the ringing phone but he pins her hands above her head
he looks into her eyes
his voice and breath are sick and raspy
whyd you betray me sugarplum
i loved you
i loved grant youre sick
grant is about to cry
i wanted you by my side but you i cant trust you now
starlas weeping confused
grant rips his shirt open
starla looks down to see the tubule protruding from the
now enormous yellow spore on grants chest
the tubule feels over starlas blouse and then slips beneath it
it starts to poke into her skin
starla grabs the leg of a coffee table beside her
she slams the table into grants head
this hurts and surprises him sufficiently to let starla get out from under him
starla grabs the cordless phone which is no longer ringing and scurries behind the couch
grant thrusts the couch aside
starla crawls away again when grant attacks her from behind
he wraps his arm around her neck pulling her back
he looks down at her with his sick angry eyes as his arm now apparently jointless curls around her like a snake
starla gasps for air
her face turns purple
she hears a slamming on the door
starla are you in there
starla tries to speak but she cannot
suddenly we hear the front door open
starla with barely an ounce of life left in her sees bill wally trevor and margaret burst into the living room
they are surprised to say the least to see this diseased humanoid strangling starla from behind
the cops freaked out pull their guns
grant makes a screeching sound at them
they shoot at grant nicking him
grant jumps away from starla back into the shadows screeching in anger and pain
starla falls to the floor
grant slips out the back door and away
the cops stare gape jawed and frozen with shock what the hell was that
starla rubs her neck coughing
bill pardy runs toward the back door
bill runs out into the backyard
wally runs up behind him
they look around at the trees surrounding the area
grant is nowhere to be seen
we crane up and away from them as we
jesus these past few days have been a trying time for us
we pan over an altar where family members have placed little items that remind them of brenda photographs mementos come home mommy cards etc
we ask you now for the safe return of our beloved brenda
everyone in this modest little church has their heads bowed as the pastor leads the prayer service
brendas husband in the front pew loses it crying
his little children beside him fiddle in their seats
and we ask that you keep your light alive in her heart wherever she may be
we ask all this in your name lord
amen bill pardy is here in full uniform hat in hands
bill looks around the church
he spots starla in the very back of church head down distraught guilty
he also sees a group of old crones nearby pointing at starla and whispering about her
starlas high heels clack on the pavement as she moves quickly to her car
starla turns to see bill coming after her
i talked to the cdc
they didnt have nothin on file consistent with grants
how about brenda
were hoping we find grant hell lead us to her
the wind is strong
her hair is flying over her face
tears come to her eyes
you all right
she moves away from him
bill watches her go
a few cops and secretaries are bustling making phone calls etc
they all look tired as if they havent slept
jack the mayor sees bill
bill spots him moving quickly toward him
bill we need to talk
bill crosses the station
bill this brendas randy flaggs niece
we need to find grant yesterday
the town council has lit a roman candle and stuck it up my ass
hell jack your leisure activities aint my business

they come to a desk with wally and trevor working away
dont worry well find him
to trevor anything new
trevor shakes his head

jack sees a secretary making copies nearby
he speaks in hushed tones that young lady heard you say squid
shes gonna go out and create a goddamn hysteria
sherry you gonna create a hysteria

you yourself said it was dark in there
you dont know what you saw
we saw his arm was all bendy

and that makes you look like a squid
ill tell you what no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests
bill wally and trevor cant help but snicker
well screw you all for laughin
bill looks over at shelby on his headset at the dispatch unit
another ranch attack
up at the castavets
bill nods for trevor and margaret to get up from their desks
they do and start to move out with bill and wally
what ranch attacks
pov a dead rottweiler is lying on its back in the long grass its gut split open and intestines spilling out almost perfectly symmetrical
it looks like one of them psyche tests
what do they call it
bill and wally are staring at the dog from above
what do you see
i see a butterfly
bill moves on through the windswept weeds
i see were fucked
three ranches in three days
margaret is taking measurements and writing in a note pad she sees bill
so i think i got it part way figured
you want to hear it
so grant i mean were saying this is grant right
grant kills a cow right about here
see theres the blood musta slit its neck
margaret walks backward showing the trail of blood in the crushed grass
so he drags the cow backwards here
only he prolly didnt know bout the castavets had them dogs
bill looks over at trevor standing up between the tall weeds holding a dogs head in his hand
he knocked thisns head clear over here
put that down numbnuts
bill peers at the various slaughtered dogs around them
so the dogs attacked somehow he slew em all and he stole off with the cow into the forest
trevor heads toward them
bill looks off into the dark forest on the edge of the ranch
hes gotta be in the forest
all three ranches run alongside it
think we should get up a search party head in there
its a hundred thousand acres
be finding a needle in a fuckstack
bill has a realization
he moves quickly for his car
wally come on
trevor and margaret get some folks together
i think i know where hes gonna hit next
closeup a property map of wheelsy is tacked to a bulletin board
red magic marker circles are around various ranch properties on the edge of the city next to an enormous forest
a finger points to one of the red circles
so the night after grant ran off a calf went missing from here the raglans ranch
reveal bill standing beside the bulletin board
a posse has gathered listening intently wally and the usual cops jack an older cop probably pulled out of retirement and a couple of recruits a redneck and a good
bill points to the next red circle
two nights ago a mare was stolen from this property run by fitzgibbon that old rancher with the cleft palate
wally whispers to margaret amused looks like a chipmunk
your momma wasnt too proud when you came out neither wally
bill points to the next circle
and then we get here the castavets where last nights shit storm took place
its like as if hes going in a pattern
is that what youre saying bill
bill nods and points to the next red circle
and if he sticks to that pattern hell be here next
belongs to a family the strutemyers
now i know yall are tired and youve barely seen your families
but were gonna have to go there tonight lie low and wait
the posse nod agreeing
lets get that son of a bitch chief
just remember we dont know what were up against here
so lets be careful
beside a small armory trevor loads a benelli m super semiautomatic shotgun
margaret checks the site on a remington pss rifle
bill takes a springfield m a pump action for himself while wally stuffs numerous pistols and ammo into a leather satchel
trevor notices a dusty grenade on a shelf
hey bill we got that grenade we confiscated from them jokers wanted to use it fish for trout
bill looks at trevor considering
as trevor puts the grenade into a side pocket on the satchel bill sees jack and the older cop watching
i didnt know the russkies were invading there folks
you seen this guy youd wished they was
the posse loads up their vehicles and start taking off out of the parking lot
bill and wally walk out to their police car
bill tosses the leather satchel into the trunk
they get in the car bill starts the engine when starla grant pulls quickly into the parking lot
bill rolls down the window as she gets out of her car and runs toward them
bill i heard what youre doing
i think i should go along
listen it doesnt matter
i gotta go
bill starts to roll away but starla holds on to the car following
dammit bill if that girls still out there how will you find her
how unless you bring grant in alive
your best chance of doing that is with me
i can talk to him he tried to kill you starla
but i got him angry cause i wasnt calm
this time i could
starlas on the verge of tears
what happened its my fault i know it
starla it aint it is
hed been acting strange
and the physical changes
i should have told someone right away
but i was just blind
i wanted to pretend it wasnt happening
if i dont do what i can to help now i just couldnt live with it
bill looks at her
he looks at wally
bill nods for starla to get in
kylie is blowing on a cup of coffee
her mom dad and two younger sisters aged and are relaxing after dinner
as kylies mom picks up plates kylie
whatd you do to your fingers
kylies mom grabs her hand looking at her very long fingernails
theyre painted sky blue and spotted with minute teddy bear and bumblebee decals
kiri goshima done em
looks like pokemons done em to me
kylies sisters laugh out loud
foreign stuff is classy if you knew something
kylies family sees out the window police cars pulling up by a gravel road
i want yall to stay inside tonight
kylies sisters nod
kylies dad steps onto the front porch of this quaint family farmhouse
he sees jack heading toward the ranch and waves
jack gives a little salute while muttering to the older cop
this turns out to be a mountain lion were gonna look like a damn bunch of idiots
the redneck and good ol boy make their way to the ranch as well
they see bill with starla
didnt know it was date night
the good ol boy laughs
ill be expecting you toss my salad at the end of all this then charlie
the posse fans out over this grassy land where the cattle graze finding places to hide
the sun sets behind them
darkness has crept over the ranch and the beautiful pastoral scene has become distinctly more sinister
the wind blows hard whistling through the long weeds
a rusty rooster windmill atop the old barn twists and clinks on its half bent perch
a piece of tarp hangs down from the barn roof flapping incessantly against the wooden wall
trevor and jack the redneck and the good ol boy and margaret and the older cop are hidden around the ranch waiting watching or dozing
inside the barn the wind is only slightly quieter and its darker
bill starla and wally are here
bill peers out through the doorway at cattle drinking from the trough
he looks at starla her head tilts to the side as she nods off
when her head falls all the way she snaps back up and catches bill gazing at her
bill nods and smiles
she doesnt smile back shes embarrassed and miserable and this is the last place she wants to be
they sit there for a moment in the dark
hey starla remember that time when you were a kid and you came knocking on my window in the middle of the night
wally looks at them
starla heres twelve
guess i was fourteen
i said starla what the hell you doing out there
she tells me shes running away to hollywood to become a big star
she said she knew i was in rotc and she was gonna need a bodyguard
invited me along
starla is embarrassed but grudgingly enjoys the story
i said starla if theres anybody can take care of herself i think its you
im gonna have to decline
to starla how fard you get
about the bus stop
ranger rick here called my dad
a cop from the get go
you son of a bitch
you fucked up our fame and fortune bill pardy
yeah maybe i did
jack smokes a cigarette as he keeps an eye out for the cow killer
the burning ember of the cigarette is blown off by the wind
jack searches for it in the dry grass trying to catch it before it starts a fire
he crawls forward slapping the ground when he glances up and sees
a large shadowy shape hulking through the trees on the edge of the forest
bill starla and wally see grant grant emerging from the forest
he has transformed into something much more monstrous a giant gangrenous slug like beast a clump of cells and tumor like protuberances
he has various tentacle like arms growing out of him like overgrown eyes on a potato
as opposed to just having the disease he now seems to be the disease itself
jack and trevor watch in amazement as grant slithers across the field his large dark watery eyes searching out prey
jack turns to trevor pissed and whispers you said squid
it got worse
the redneck and the good ol boy watch too mouths dropped
the diseased grant slithers through the grass just a few feet beside margaret and the older cop
they duck below the grass looking as if theyre going to have heart attacks
grant approaches a cow
the cow makes a little moo of protest when he gets too close and steps back
the grant creature stabs one of his tentacle growths into the cows neck piercing it
the cow stumbles choking
blood spurts from her neck
and she topples over
bill and wally stare out the window motionless
what we gonna do now bill
cuffs wont even fit on im
starla musters courage
she stands and moves out of the barn
starla where you
grant wraps a feeler around the cows horns and starts dragging it back in the direction of the forest
bill motions through the barn window to margaret
margaret motions to trevor
trevor motions to the recruits
and starla moves slowly in toward grant
grant turns and looks at her with his half human eyes
his breathing is loud raspy and sick
he sees in a wide circle around him the nervous posse standing up their guns at the ready
starla moves even closer
bill and wally are coming in close behind her
as starla and the posse get closer grant looks almost scared
his eyes dart around from cop to cop
youre just sick is all
but well take you to get help right now
ill stay by your side grant just like i swore i would
for better or worse
grants huge milky eyes betray that he does
the posse inch in closer tightening the circle
grant lets out a piercing screech of protest
all of the posse stop terrified
everything is quiet and still except for grants gross breathing
deep in out
its gonna be all right
grant screeches again a warning
he looks from starla to bill with hurt jealous eyes and growls
then grants eyes close to half mast and he turns away
his tentacle tightens around the cows horns and he again drags it toward the forest
while bill tries to decide what to do the good ol boy nervously blocks grants path
he aims his pistol at him
you stop right there you son of a bitch
i dont care what kinda leprosy you got
we need to find that girl
now you can make this peaceful or you can make it hard
grant and the good ol boy stare at each other
and then grant snaps out a tentacle arm whipping it up the front of the mans body and back
the front of the good ol boys whole body is split neatly in half
for a split second he remains alive the two different sides of his split head look down in disbelief as his organs spill out from inside him
and then he topples over
the posse shoot at grant
starla covers her head
grant is struck he screeches in pain
he lets go of the cow
he slithers with incredible speed off toward the forest
bill and the other posse members take off after him like hounds on the heel of their prey
they shoot madly
starla watches as the posse follows grant into the woods
starla stands alone and worried a moment and then she darts off after them
kylie is running a bath
she hears gunshots echo in the distance
she peers out a little window above the tub trying to see where the shots are coming from
the posse run through this very dark forest after grant leaping over brush and rocks
theyre nervous but also excited as the primordial hunting urge takes over
their eyes are filled with anger and bloodlust
theyre able to follow grant only by catching glimpses a flash of flesh between trees a tentacle disappearing around brush
there he is
they fire at the creature taking chunks out of trees but missing
hes too fast
grant slips around a boulder and splashes through a creek and into the plentiful trees beyond
he rustles thick fronds as he moves up alongside the creek
the posse run up the creek itself splashing trying to peer through the leaves to get a shot at grant
jack carrying his revolver trips and falls in the creek
he cuts his knee on a sharp rock
he stands and keeps going
they come to the posse come up out of the creek
theyve completely lost track of the diseased man beast
they stop out of breath and looking around
whered he go
we aint never gonna find that girl now
the redneck is weeping with rage
ill kill that asshole what he did to charlie
bill sees starla run up behind them
he waves her back
starla get the hell out of here
starla takes a couple steps back but doesnt leave
she watches there half in shadows as the posse creep around searching for some trail of grant
margaret looks down into the bubbling creek
she sees its turning red
she looks up the trail of red which is rippling downhill in the water
the red flow starts somewhere near a boulder
bill and wally are searching in front of the boulder
margaret sees but they dont grant pulling himself up on a tree branch and rising behind them
blood from a shotgun wound is dripping into the creek
grant pissed lifts a tentacle
bill turns as the tentacle swings down toward him
he falls back the tentacle slashes inches from his face
bill blasts his shotgun up at grant but grant is already slithering swiftly back into the thick brush
the posse squeeze themselves though the brush following
the posse emerge on the other side of the brush only to be confronted by a terrible odor
they cover their noses and mouths as their faces shrivel in disgust
what the hells that smell
its something dead
the posse gaze up at the old ramshackle barn where grant had brought brenda
its coming from in there aint it
margaret looks at bill
think hes inside
bill takes the lead carefully approaching the barn
the posse follows their weapons drawn
the closer they get to the barn the more unbearable the smell becomes
only bill intent on the task in front of him doesnt react to the stench at all
bill leans his ear in close to the front door and listens
through the door he can hear a quiet sobbing
bill and wally exchange a look
bill steps back
he and wally aim their shotguns at the door
bill nods to margaret and gestures for her to open it
starla watches all this from the rear
margaret swings open the door
bill and wally move cautiously but quickly inside
but they stop suddenly in disgust and horror
and she doesnt look good
her weepy little head is stuck to the front of a huge fleshy orb which is what her body has become
this enormous ball of flesh is nine or ten feet tall
vestigial fingers protrude from the sides
she is utterly immobile
her flesh sloshes slightly and constantly a thousand snakes seem to be slithering beneath her thin tight bruised skin
the woman is in great pain
her mouth and chin are stained with blood
the posse and starla enter behind bill and wally and are equally astounded
they see the source of the awful stench
brenda is encircled by the rotting carcasses of cows and horses and forest critters
they are mostly skeletal as they have been largely devoured
theyre swarming with flies
the stench is so bad the posse cover their faces with the bottom of their shirts
the sobbing brenda looks desperately at bill and wally
somethings wrong with me
bill and wally get in a little closer
i didnt want no one to be seeing me like this
as the posse inch closer brendas whole body suddenly lurches forward a bit like whatevers inside her is trying to get out and to the posse
brenda screams in agony
the posse jump back
they stare as she recomposes herself
how are my boys bill
are they all right
boys are fine brenda
uh whats whats happening here exactly
im so fucking hungry bill
im so hungry
i just never knew anybody could be so hungry
brenda tries to smile in a way she might charm her daddy into giving her candy
this is creepy as hell
would you mind handing me a piece of that possum there at your feet
trevor gags and runs out of the barn
trevor vomits into some bushes
bill eyes poor brenda
i think we best get you to a hospital right quick
what the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital bill
again brenda screams
her body lurches forward
whys she doing that
her tumors is moving
bill get her to stop that shit
her body lurches forward again
and then again
starla notices that brendas skin is starting to split and tear on her side
little fuckers are tearing me aparrrr
brenda screams like a woman giving a thousand evil births at once and her body rips open in one part and then in quick succession another and another
bill looks out one of the windows
grant is peering in at them smiling
he led us here
and then brendas body bursts open completely like a water balloon hitting cement and thousands of little slithering eyeless parasites with slippery black red skin like slugs spill forth
the horrid creatures eight inches long and a few inches thick swarm over the posse completely covering them before they can react
trevor sees the things flooding over the posse in the barn
the parasites are especially drawn to the posses heads
because there are so many the weight of the beasts knocks most of them down
trevor runs but the things make it out the doorway covering him like lava in one million b
and he buckles
a parasite slithers quickly and fluidly into wallys mouth
he gags on it
his eyes flip back up into his head and his body starts to spasm
jack tries to pull one away from his face but its too slippery and it disappears inside his mouth
his body too convulses and he spits up blood
bill notices the parasites slithering into the mouths of the redneck and the older cop as well whites of their eyes bodies convulsing spewing blood
bill sees the things oozing up margarets neck
margaret cover your mouth
bill sees trevor outside the door in the dirt trying to slap the parasites off
bill yells to everyone dont let em in your mouths
one starts to get in bills mouth as he speaks but he slaps it aside
margaret pulls her shirt over her face
she puts her hand over her mouth as the parasites rush up her
shes knocked over and falls back onto the floor
a parasite slithers between starlas lips when suddenly a knife thrusts down pinning the creature to the dirt stopping it from oozing further into starla
bill is holding the knife in one hand his other hand firmly over his mouth
bill swats more incoming parasites away from starlas mouth
he covers her mouth with his free hand
he lies on top of her mushing their bodies and faces as closely together as possible so the things dont get into them
the parasites swarm all over them flapping their slimy little tails as they try to fight their way inside their mouths
but bill holds tight to himself and starla
eventually the parasites give up on bill and starla and begin to slither away
bill watches as they crawl off the posse and filter out of the barn in a squirmy mound
eventually theyre gone
bill takes his hand from starlas mouth
starla looks around
she sees margaret lift her face from the ground shivering holding her shirt over her mouth
they gaze out the front door of the barn
trevor pulls his face from the dirt and stands
he spits violently and wipes the dirt off his tongue with his wrist
they wanted us to eat em
why would they want that
bill is trying to make sense of it all
he gazes down at brendas body her bloody skin and misshapen skeleton spread out over the floor split open like an enormous bloody tiger rug
he looks around at the posse lying on the floor in mangled positions their mouths and lips covered in blood still lightly convulsing
he gazes out into the forest to see the parasites rushing away like an ugly wormy army shaking the brush as they head off in different directions
parasites crawl over rocks and out of the forest and onto the ranch
the strutemyer farmhouse looms nearby
kylie is taking a steamy bubble bath
her head is back her eyes shut shes enjoying the warm water
the tub faucet drips lightly in an uneven rhythm
the parasites squirm up the side of the house sticking to the wood siding
kylie glances out the window beside the tub at the starry sky and crescent moon beautiful and still
theres a knock on the bathroom door
kylie turns toward the door as she does a parasite crawls across the window behind her streaking a moist slimy trail
youre gonna turn into a plum in there
plums turn into prunes
kylies mom is at the bathroom door
i know what turns into what
you got school tomorrow
finish up in there and get to bed
kylie grunts in vague agreement
kylies mom trots down the hall to another door
she knocks once then opens the door to kylies younger sisters lie in single beds reading goosebumps by bed lamps clipped to the headboards
time to turn in ladies
just a couple more pages mom
come on now
the girls sigh in lazy protest but still turn off their reading lamps
through the window we see kylies mom start to close the door
dont let the bed bugs bite
numerous parasites slither into frame up the side of the house approaching the girls bedroom window which is open a few inches for air
kylies mom shuts their door completely
the girls turn on their sides and close their eyes to sleep
and the parasites pour in through the cracked window
they slither over the walls
their slimy black red bodies contrast sharply with the pretty flowered wallpaper
the door cracks open and a parasite enters
it slithers silently over the linoleum tiles
it arrives at the base of the tub and crawls up the side
kylie continues relaxing her eyes closed
she doesnt see the parasite enter the soapy bath water at her feet
kylie hears a soft splashing and peers down
she spots the creature swimming toward her between her knees
kylie shrieks and scrambles up to get out of the tub
as she clamors out she slips and falls to the floor
the parasite squirms up kylies wet naked back
kylie shrieks again jumping up as she tries to slap the thing off
the parasite winds toward her lips
kylie goes to grab it with both hands but it slips through them
the thing slides into kylies mouth as she looks down at it
kylie snatches the very end of the parasites tail
her long teddy bear spotted fingernails pinch it there digging into the parasites flesh barely stopping it from sliding completely into her mouth
it wildly flaps its tail like a docked trout desperate to enter her
kylie falls to her knees
her eyes roll back in her head and her body spasms while she holds tenuously onto the very tip of the parasites tail
we track in to a closeup of kylies face a slight white electrical telepathic charge can be seen sparking inside her mouth
we are rushing through some amoebic landscape past microbes and cytoplasm and cells and to perhaps the memories of some creature not of earth
its eyesight is not like our own its in grainy black and white and amber outlines
various images flash in quick succession including the following we are on top of an alien animal pinning it down
it howls beneath us as we tear into its flesh feasting
all around us diseased monstrous beasts feed on more alien animals
they lunge toward them and pin them down ripping them apart like some national geographic documentary shot in hell
in fast motion unfamiliar plant life around us grows sick and withers dying out
a group of diseased monstrous beasts cry out in uniform pain
they buckle to their knees now theyre dying
the diseased beasts feed on their own appendages
kylie tries to regain control of her mind
her eyes fight against flipping back in her head
tears pour down her face
she pulls the parasite out just a bit
but then it slams back into her and there are more sparks inside her mouth we are climbing up through a creamy gelatinous yellow
an opening slit widens in front of us and we see grant slowly bending to look at us the forest behind him
we watch starla soaping herself in the shower
we make love to starla our hands on her face
we sit over a convulsing brenda impregnating her with our tubule
we see the posse members coming in toward us
with a last desperate effort kylie yanks at the exhausted worm pulling it fully from her mouth
it flaps in her fingers
kylie spits up blood
kylie tosses the parasite away from her
though slightly crippled the little bastard writhes back toward her
kylie spots her curling iron on the counter its plugged in the red light is on
she grabs it and swings it into the wormy thing
the parasite squeaks and trembles with pain
smoke rises from it as kylie digs the curling iron in deeper burning it and finally killing it
kylie lifts the iron in front of her and looks at it
the dead parasite is stuck to it dangling from the metal
kylie drops the iron
she quickly steps into her clothes lying on the floor
she runs out of the bathroom and into kylie runs to the stairway
dozens of the things are slithering up the stairs and up the handrail towards her
kylie hears her sisters screams
she looks in their direction running toward their room
kylie tosses open her sisters door
kylies youngest sister is on her knees on the bed a parasite sticking out of her mouth
her eyes are rolled back
her arms flail spastically
the slithering beast wags its tail as it disappears down her throat
kylies other sister is backing into a corner with parasites crawling up her body
shes screaming bloody hell trying to slap them off
kylie runs toward her to help
kylie slaps the parasites off her sister
but theres too many and theyre too fast
they slide into her sisters mouth
her sisters eyes flip back in her skull as the thing disappears completely and she starts spitting up blood
kylie sees the parasites around the room coming at her
theres a clear path toward a window
kylie runs to the window and shoves it open
as the things approach her she crawls out kylie steps onto this shingled angled canopy over the front porch
she turns to see the parasites slithering out towards her
she looks down
its probably too far to jump but she has no choice
so she jumps down onto kylie lands hard tumbling over
she glances back at the front of the house
through the kitchen window she sees her mom and dad eyes rolled back convulsing spitting up blood
more parasites are crawling towards kylie through the grass
she spots her familys old luv pickup truck on the driveway in front of her
she breaks for it
she throws open the front door and jumps inside
the things approach crawling in after her
kylie tries to slam the door shut but it wont many things are stuck in the door jamb
they squeak in a chorus of pain trying to wriggle toward her
so she slams the door again and again and she slices the little bastards in half
kylie makes sure none are inside
she feels for the keys in the ignition
there arent any
the creatures crawl up and over all the pickups windows trying to get in
slithery shadows cover over kylie leaving her in almost complete darkness
kylie crouches down in on herself and wails
starla trevor and margaret stand wide eyed and shaken
all three seem to be in some mild state of shock
bill suppressing his desperation is trying to make contact on his police radio
were gonna need paramedics out here right away
we got four men down
bill listens for a response but theres only static
he presses the button again
shelby you there
still only static
bill tries another frequency
shelby this is bill
we got an emergency here
bill steps outside the doorway to see if he can get reception
trailing off shelby
starla sees wallys body on the floor
his skin is white and corpse like
his mouth is streaked with blood
starla crouches beside him and takes his pulse
her hands are visibly shaking
is he alive
starla looks at margaret and nods
thats fucking pushing it margaret
trevor looks about to cry
what the hell were those things
you ever seen anything like that
you ever heard of anything like that
margaret shakes her head
trevor looks at starla who also shakes her head
and i watch animal planet all the fuckin time
bill re enters
no reception out here
bill ill run out to your car call for paramedics from there
thats a long ways
them worms are out there
ill keep my mouth covered
the three of you you wait here
get these folks out of the barn
the stench and rot cant be any good for em
margaret and trevor nod
as bill starts to leave starla grabs him
be careful bill
makes a feeble attempt at a smile
he jogs off into the forest
bill runs into the small glade and looks around trying to remember which way he came from
he gazes between some greenery some distance away and spies a long lashed deer munching on foliage
a couple more deer and a fawn are eating as well
bill looks at them a moment peaceful perhaps a sign of some hope
and then a parasite crawls up the deers neck and slithers into its mouth
parasites crawl up the bodies and necks of the deer behind it
the deer buck and flounce and scratch trying to get the things off of them
bill runs away as fast as he can
trevor and margaret carry jack out of the barn
hes bloated corpse like and covered in varicose veins
margaret is wearing a gag like swatch of clothing tied around her mouths to protect themselves
trevors gag is down around his chin so he can chatter
its got to be some goddamn biological weapons
governments testin em out on us
cause who gives a shit if wheelsy disappears right
they set down jack and head back toward the barn
i hope it aint contagious
ill be pissed as hell i turn into a big mollusk
ill fuckin sue i swear to god
starla also wearing a gag is kneeling beside wally who is similarly sick and bloated
his lips are parched and cracking
starla squeezes a wet cloth dripping all the water onto wallys lips
then she stands and heads toward the creek
she doesnt see wally open his eyes behind her
he sits up and stares over at starla with milky eyes as she kneels down beside the water
starla dips the swatch of clothing into the creek re wetting it
she stands and turns only to see wally directly in front of her standing between trees almost completely covered in darkness
starla pulls the gag from her mouth
wally speaks with grants cadence
its a sacred bond
just like you said
starla stares at him
wally almost looks weepy
im sorry bout trying to strangle you and all
i lost lost my head
i didnt want to do none of the things i done
not kill them pets
not make brenda a womb
but its my nature aint it
how can you blame a one for actin according to his nature
starla too freaked to speak takes a step back from him
i wanted to tell you what was going on
but i didnt didnt think youd love me no more
i never knew
love starla i trevor and margaret are setting down the older cop
they see wally standing
margaret pulls down her gag
wally turns and stares at her like some angry animal
you all right
wally doesnt answer
maybe you better sit back down
you dont look so good
trevors staring at something
margaret follows his eye line
jack and the older cop are sitting up staring at her just like wally
the redneck stumbles into the barn doorway also staring at them
kylie is still alone in the luv truck
the windows are clear the parasites have abandoned their quest just as they did with the posse in the barn
but kylie stays in the car trembling afraid to leave
she hears a door open
she sees her parents and her sisters come stumbling out the front door of her home
theyre also bloated and diseased
their chins and shirts are stained with the blood they spit up
kylie honey you okay
come on out
her family lumbers up to the truck
they peer in with their milky eyes
her youngest sister pushes her face up close to the window
her family tries the door handles but theyre locked
open the door sweetie
i know we dont look so good but your mommy and daddy love you
now kylie theres no excuse why not to be with your family
this is family fun day isnt it
they continue rattling the door handles over and over
they slap the windows
her sister speaks in a singsongy voice
kyyy leee this is your last cha ance
her dad leans over and picks up a large rock
he carries it toward the truck
he holds it up over the windshield
kylie screams as he smashes it down
the windshield cracks but doesnt shatter
he holds it up again
bill out of breath runs out of the forest bill emerges on the edge of the ranch stretching five or six acres out in front of him
on the other side of the field is the gravel road where his police car is parked
beside the field is the strutemyers farmhouse
bill hears a crash
he turns to see the diseased strutemyers in their driveway all holding rocks now smashing the pickups windows
the strutemyers stop mid swing
they turn toward him
kylie sees bill through the rear windshield
she unlocks the door and jumps out of the car
kylie runs past her family and up to bill
she grabs onto him and hides behind him weeping
whats going on here
kylies dads cadence is also like grants well hello there pardy
what happened to you dwight
kylies dad looks down at his own bloated arm
poison ivy out back maybe
kylie is obviously in shock
theyre not my
yall just wait in this spot
im gonna call the paramedics for you
kylie can come with hey there killer
bill turns to see the rancher with the cleft palate now diseased holding a shovel
he swings it into bill knocking him down
her family runs in toward them
she looks around to see a couple more diseased ranchers rushing toward them through the fields
the cleft palate rancher stands over bill and raises the shovel to bring it down again
bill feels for his shotgun which has fallen into the dirt beside him
he yanks the trigger
the blast hits the rancher in the foot
bill stands pulling kylie with him as the other diseased folks rush toward them through the fields
bill and kylie dash toward the cluster of cars as the diseased chase them
the infected posse wally jack the older cop and the redneck recruit are all coming in towards trevor and margaret
now whatd i say
yall just sit down
you need to get some goddamn rest
starla watches this by herself next to the creek
she eyes a rifle in the dirt
jack grabs a fistful of trevors hair and restrains his arms
wally pulls his pistols from their holsters and tosses them into the dirt
margaret goes to grab her pistol when the redneck opens his mouth wide and gleeks that is he sends a yellowish globby stream shooting out of the back of his
the glob splashes on margarets hand
margaret screams drops the pistol
margaret looks at her hand as the gleek liquid sinks into her skin
the hand is swelling monstrously
parts of it are nearly dripping off the bone
whatd you do to my fuckin hand
jack opens his mouth and gleeks too shooting the stream glob forward and onto her neck
margaret screams again grabbing onto her neck
margaret tries to speak but she struggles just to breathe as her neck puffs up impeding her thorax
the older cop buries his fingers into her neck
the puffy flesh comes off easily its soft almost creamy
he stuffs the flesh into his mouth eating it
as margaret topples over dying the other posse members turn to look at a very freaked out trevor
the redneck opens his mouth at him when let him go
the posse turn and see starla who has made her way over to where the rifle was on the ground and is now pointing the rifle at the posse trembling
trevor come on
surprised they release trevor
whatd you do to her
jack stares at starla
he too speaks with grants cadence
there you go sugarplum
why you choosing camps fore you hear both sides of the story
both sides of the story
why are you talking like grant
the posse moves toward her
starla is crying
the posse makes a collective screeching sound then speaks again cause i am grant
im you husband im you husband goddammit you swore to honor and obey obey me obey me so put that goddamn gun down
dont come any closer
you aint gonna shoot me
you always needed me to protect you
you for damn sure aint got the balls to starla blasts wally blowing open a big crater into his face
wally falls to his knees
starla and trevor look on in shock as they see
a slithering parasite squirming out of the crater on his face out of the wallys brain
the little thing squirms down wallys body and slithers off quickly into the woods
wally falls over dead
the sick posse look at starla surprised infuriated
and then they leap at her
starla tries to shoot them
but shes out of ammo
she and trevor turn and dash away as quickly as their legs can take them
trevor and starla run in a zigzag pattern through trees rooted closely together panicked breathing heavy
oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit
bill and kylie arrive at his police car
bill throws the door open and shoves kylie inside
as he starts to get in he turns to see the two little girls closing in
one opens her mouth and gleeks it shoots out and lands on the car right beside bills hand
the other little girl opens her mouth to gleek as bill jumps into the drivers seat
he slams the door shut just as the oozy liquid splashes on the window beside him
bill is grossed out by this but he doesnt have much time
he goes to reload his shotgun when he remembers
ammos in the trunk
he grabs the police radio
trevor turns and sees jack the redneck and the older cop leap powerfully over the brush behind them coming in fast
but hes able to grab onto his radio
they killed margaret
kylies two sisters jump onto the hood screeching
they slam rocks on the windshield
into radio where are you
were coming your way man
bill jams the car forward knocking the sisters off the hood
then he slams on the brakes
he looks back and sees the two little girls running toward the car again
and he sees the mass of diseased ranch families also running toward the car
kylie is screaming and crying
but instead of pulling forward on the gravel road bill turns up and onto the ranch itself back towards the running diseased
my friends are still in the forest
bill speeds the police car over the dirt field trying to avoid approaching ranchers
some leap at the car holding on and getting tossed aside
bill zooms back toward the trees
just as bill gets a little headway on the diseased the car gets stuck in some mud
the wheels spin spraying mud as the infected approach
starla looks back to see jack right behind her
the infected arrive at the car
bill just lets his foot off the gas and sits there letting the ranchers leap onto the car
kylie looks at bill panicked by his choice to do nothing
we need their weight
bill slams down the gas again and the car zooms forward
the diseased get knocked off
bill rushes toward the trees of the forest
starla keeps running when she trips and falls
she looks down to see she stumbled over old barbed wire fencing now long fallen and curling on the forest floor
starla forces herself up as jack closes in
jack grabs onto her blouse screeching furiously
when he hears something and looks over to see bills police car cruising over the forest floor directly toward him
jack frightened lets go of starla
hes about to get hit when the police car suddenly stops jammed between two trees inches from jack
jack smiles and moves toward bill but starla rises behind him holding a sharp rusty stake from the barbed wire fence
she thrusts it forward hard and it pops out the front of jacks neck
jack turns to look at starla and topples over into the leaves
bill backs the car out from between the trees
he sees the older cop and redneck coming in toward them
trevor and starla get into the car
the older cop watches them back away and yells starla
the police car pulls up and out of the forest
the car is in bad shape
steam rises from the smashed grill
bill looks to his side hes down a bit from the strutemyers ranch
he pulls away heading back toward town
the foursome sit in a stupefied daze
starlas beside bill
trevor and kylie are in the back
bill grabs the police radio
everyone notes this worried
bill tries again shelby you there
for a moment theres nothing
and then yo chief
how yall doin
bill and starla look at each other relieved
shelby sits at the police operators unit peppy
you dig that rat out of the hole
listen you got any reports of
i dont know what you call em
they look like big slugs only fast
less you talkin about that new waitress down at sloans
shelby oh shit
i hope she aint a police radio aficionado
if so i apolog shelby shut up
keep an eye out for these things
if you see em keep your mouth covered
otherwise theyll go straight down it
shelby looks confused and nods
are you nodding
i cant hear when youre nodding
well be there in ten minutes
bill hangs up
kylie is clutching onto herself hollow eyed in deep shock
she mutters almost unintelligibly the worms are in their brains
starla bill and trevor look at her
the camera tracks quickly forward through the forest and to a closeup on the redneck who is hunched over margarets body eating her flesh
match cut to a cat scan of the rednecks head a parasite is imbedded into his brain its tail hangs down his spine wagging just a bit
drivin em around
bill stares at kylie like shes insane
we saw one one came out of wallys head
sort of his eye it came out there kylie how do you kylie is rocking back and forth
kylie how do you know that
kylie shakes her head
she doesnt want to answer
a lot of bad things have happened to you today we know
but we need your help to find out whats going on
i was in the bath
it tried to go inside me and i for a minute i became it
i got it out
what are they
part of him
starla stares at her
but not always
i was he was
other stuff too
what other stuff
kylie kind of points at the sky
hes a fucking martian
a martian is from mars trevor
kylie tries to think
for real it looks like a needle
its real face
but it always gots another
he goes from place to place worlds
he takes over half of whats alive and eats the other half
till theyre gone
they stare at her freaked out
now hes here
he went in mr
through a wound on his stomach
he took him over
his his brain everything what he knew
hes only been dumb stuff before amoeba things and rhino things
he liked being human
didnt want to change
and you said the worms are part of him
theyre all linked like one creature
when one sees you they all see you
an animal that doesnt procreate
it spreads grows
a living disease
to kylie so the way to stop this thing is to stop grant
the police car starts chugging
the car slows and comes to a stop
bill starla kylie and trevor step slowly out of the car
they look around the deserted road
the wide open night is shrouded in darkness
they can see the lights of wheelsy down the road in front of them
bill speaks into the radio again as he gets his leather satchel of weaponry out of the trunk
trevor grabs ammo from the satchel to reload his pistol
shelby we broke down on a mile outside town
come pick us up
i got to leave my post
the foursome walks down the road toward the city
starla and bill are in the lead
she looks at him
was always curious why you
married grant in the first place
just never seemed outta love
i know what people say bill
remember back in high school i worked at my fathers gas station
grant used to get filled up every day
i knew it was just to see me
he was too old but he was handsome
and he had that big ol lincoln then
i flirted with him
well big ol lincoln sure
guess i would have flirted with him too
starla smiles thinks
my father he was he was real close to evil
people didnt know
from the time i was a toddler hed beat the hell out of me
i dont mean just like a smack for smart mouthing
he took a real enjoyment in it
and when i turned eleven or twelve things
well they got worse
starla looks at bill who seems struck
when you wanted to run away i called your dad
that wasnt a good night no
starla shrugs it off
anyway grant rolls in one day
i fill his tank with like an eighth a gallon as usual
and he notices my lips all swollen up and starts asking me how it happened
i dont know why i chose then why grant i guess i saw an opportunity
and i told him everything first time i told anyone
grant was furious
he picked up a tire iron walked straightaway into the garage and beat my father half to death
you say its not about love bill
but that was the closest thing to it i ever knew
grant asked me to marry him a few weeks later
safe with him
starla looks at him smiles
after all this shit tonight i know for sure now you regret not running off with me to hollywood
i always regretted that
starla looks at him moved
trevor looks at kylie shivering and terrified
dont worry kid
pretty soon well be in town everythingll be fine
a slithering parasite squirms over a paint chipped sign that reads welcome to wheelsy south carolina the wheels of the future featuring early sixties graphics of a utopian future
the camera moves down to the road where hundreds of slithering parasites squirm into the city
they divide off in thin lines heading toward the various homes
we move up to a window on a small house through which we can see an overweight woman in spasms with a slithering thing in her mouth
we pan to the window of the home next door where we can see a family gathered around a corpse feasting on his goopy flesh
our foursome look up to see a buick century parked at a haphazard angle in the middle of the road
the drivers side door is open
the headlights are still on
they look at each other
bill takes his flashlight off his belt and aims it in front of him
they all slowly approach the car in the darkness
bill aims his flashlight into the buick
the keys are still there but no ones inside
trevor looks at the grill of the car
they musta hit a deer
probably got out to see if its okay
bill and the others look around
bill hears a lapping sound behind him
he turns aiming the flashlight downward
a diseased deer is lapping a thick purple tongue on the wound of a dead man
the sick creature is mostly hairless and pink and covered in veins
bulbous black eyes hang on the sides of its head like a goldfishs
the diseased deer glances up at bill and growls a low growl
the deer springs upward bringing his hoofs into bills chest
bill is knocked violently to the gravel dropping his shotgun and satchel
the deer rears back and brings his hoofs down into bill again
they crack bills head against the hard road
kylie trevor and starla see diseased deer coming in at them from different directions
the deer screech like dying rabbits
trevor aims his pistol at a deer jumping toward him
he shoots misses
the deer knocks him down
the deer stomps his feet rearing up and down on trevors ribs almost like a little dance
the deer tears at trevors sleeve with decidedly carnivorous teeth forcing him into letting go of his gun
she dives into a small space beneath a rock overhang on the side of the road
she watches whats going on from there
starla sees the buick a few yards away
she glances beside her to see the largest diseased deer of all a horned buck careening toward her
she dashes toward the buick as fast as she can
a tumorous doe leaps onto bill biting into his shoulder and tearing at his flesh so now he has two deer on him
bill is bleeding dizzy and disoriented but hes able to turn just a bit to see the barrel of his shotgun above him
he tries to scoot himself back as hes being battered
he reaches up for the shotgun but the tips of his fingers barely graze the muzzle
starla arrives at the buick and starts to crawl into the front seat
but the horned buck is upon her
he bites into starlas ankle
he yanks back on her half pulling her onto the road
but starla grabs onto the steering wheel with all her might and pulls against the horned bucks massive power
the deer on trevor starts pulling him off dragging him down the road as he hollers
kylie underneath the rock overhang watches bill try to scoot himself back and reach for the shotgun
its just a little too far away
she works up her nerve and slowly starts to crawl out toward him
as starla is stretched between the horned buck pulling on her ankle and her hand on the steering wheel shes able to flip on her side and turn the keys
in the ignition the engine starts
she reaches one hand down to the floorboard pressing on the gas
the buick lurches forward wrenching her away from the horned bucks mouth
bill reaches again for the barrel of his rifle
its too far away
but then he sees kylie at the butt of the rifle
she reaches out and pushes it just a little into bills hand
bill grips the muzzle like a baseball bat and swings it into the face of the deer jumping on him knocking the beast back
the deer tries to stumble forward again but its whole head and neck have been knocked askew
it topples over dead
bill flips the shotgun forward into his hands
he stuffs the muzzle into the tumorous doe biting into his leg
the deer looks at him
blood is running down bills face and he looks half crazed
bill glances down and sees the telephone wire wrapped around her ankle
bill pulls the trigger destroying her
he stands looking around for the deer with trevor
it has dragged him a fair distance down the street
bill shoots once missing it and again hitting it straight on
kylie looks around to see more diseased deer running through the fields toward them
starla pulls herself into the drivers seat and backs up alongside her friends
throws open the passenger door
bill fumbles for the radio controls
trevor looks out the window watching the deer fade away behind them
when i buy my zoo im leaving them things the hell out
hey there chief
we need people out here at cosgrove and mccammon right away
dont worry chief
shelby sick and bloated speaks into his radio as he moves down the street with a hoard of the infected
already on our way
kylie turns her head and glances out the window
starla bill and trevor turn to see an suv barreling straight towards them
it slams hard into the side of the buick
and smashes the car back across a short lot and through the glass storefront of a flower store
the buick and suv are destroyed amidst the ruins of this store
shattered vases and flowers surround them
glass fragments dangle from the window frame
some fall and clink to the floor
starla lifts her battered head from the wheel
she looks beside her to see bill and trevor seemingly unconscious
she looks back at kylie
the impact has killed her
her neck is bent at an ungodly angle
bone juts up out of her skin
starla looks out her rear window and sees the suv door open and the diseased driver stumble out
his body is battered and broken but still he lumbers toward her
he tries to speak but his jaw is broken and only a mumbly moan comes out
starla struggles to get out of the car
eventually she does and she falls to the floor amidst the broken glass from the shattered window and the water all over the floor from the broken vases
she sees the moaning driver limping toward her
hes still trying to speak but hes unintelligible
the driver gets close ready to grab her
starla sees a metal bar
she grabs it
and slams it into the diseased mans shin
he topples over
she crawls onto the fallen driver and brings the metal bar down into his head again and again shouting and crying with fury
starla looks down at the man who is very dead
starla looks up to see dozens of diseased townsfolk coming at her from down the street between buildings
they see starla there
bill and trevor limp up behind starla pulling her toward a door on the back wall
bill closes and locks the door behind them
the diseased townsfolk surround the little store on all sides
what the hell are we going to do
just block the doors any way you can
bill grabs hammers and nails off a hardware bench
trevor knocks things off shelves and yanks up the metal shelving
starla looks doubtful of this whole activity
but still she helps
the storeroom has two doors
they start nailing anything over them they can
trevor sees some slithering parasites coming in through a crack in the upper corner of the room
trevor aims his pistol at the things and starts shooting wildly at them blasting up the whole room
bill and starla see slithering parasites coming in from other cracks in the room as well
they also blast at them
dust is all around they can hardly see
bill runs out of ammo
he grabs a hand held black and decker electric circular saw and turns it on
he starts jamming it into the parasites cutting them up and putting big slices in the floor
they squeak with pain
the diseased townsfolk wail and slap their hands on the walls almost rhythmically like some tribal ritual
some push on the doors
bill hears something pop behind him
he turns to see a little hole in one of the doors
three diseased fingers slip inside trying to pull away more
bill uses the circular saw to cut off the fingers
an arm pops through the door
bill slams the circular saw into that
a mans eye peeks through another crack
bill jams the circular saw through the crack and into the mans face
the face sawed man backs away from the hole clutching his bleeding eye
bill spots a wide piece of shelving falling off the door across from him
he runs over to the space when the circular saw stops turning
bill turns to see hes accidentally unplugged it
the diseased townsfolk have all gathered on one side of the building now putting all their efforts into tearing down one door
some have even climbed onto the roof above it curling off the gutter and roofing overhead
bill grabs his leather satchel and starts to reload his shotgun
starla sees that the diseased townsfolk have almost torn down one of the doors
this is stupid
starla goes to the other door and starts tearing away the planks they nailed there
what are you doing
we cant make it
just get away when you get the chance
he wants me bill
im going to get him to take me to him
see if you can follow me and kill him
another full metal plate is pushed off the door
a diseased mans face peeks through
trevor swirls to see it
the man gleeks hitting trevor on his chest
trevor looks down in shock
and the whole door and part of the wall bursts open
the diseased pour inside and around trevor gleeking all over him splattering his body with the burning liquid
trevor starts to puff up swelling becoming soft
they grab him
bill grabs trevor by the wrist and tries to pull him away from them
but trevor screams in agony the liquid has made his flesh too soft
his entire body splits apart like wet tissue his organs spilling out in front of them
bill stares down in shock still holding trevors arm
starla has pulled away enough boards of the other door
she throws it open
none of the diseased are on this side of the building anymore
she moves outside
bill follows her
two diseased people appear screeching and running toward them
bill shoots them both
and he makes a break for it running as fast as he can across the street
he turns expecting to see starla right behind him
but she has stayed behind staring quietly at the ground
starla has tears in her eyes
she motions with her head for bill to go
bill is confused
the diseased townsfolk come up around starla from the sides of the flower store no one paying attention to bill
they encircle her slowly
some screech angrily at her
shes too disgusted or fearful to even look in their eyes
they breathe with sick raspy breath
and they wail in a cacophony of simultaneous voices all the deep angers fears frustrations and jealousies they inherited from grant grant such as you said for better or worse
i gave you everything
its not just about lesson i wanted you by my side plans
hank wilcox wants sugarplum
but im too your pussy
ugly now huh
your daddyd still be you always thought i was a fucking your every hole joke aint you
werent it for me
you like pardy bettern me
thats who you want to screw now
they surround her
they touch her body her ass her breasts
pull on her clothes
i know i havent behaved how you how you want
starla glances down to see a diseased dog licking her calf tasting her
a diseased man grabs the side of her neck and face
not here though okay
not all of you
im not used to i want to talk to your face grant
your more real face
your the diseased townsfolk grab starla enveloping her and start dragging her away
a few townsfolk remain behind
they look around for bill
where are you pardy
but hes nowhere to be seen
they screech angrily
bill runs as fast as he can across the street here the same direction the hoard took starla but down a block
bill falls against the side of this building hiding in a dark crevice
down the way he can see numerous dead bodies and a woman chased down and tackled by some infected townsfolk
some diseased townsfolk wander by bill looking for him
bill crouches down so he isnt seen
come on out pardy
weve surrounded the town you prick
aint no way outta here
bill waits for them to pass
when theyre gone bill looks up toward the next street he can see the hoard moving starla across that street
he makes sure no ones looking and follows her
one of the diseased pushes starla too hard and she falls to her hands and knees
they keep pushing her
she stumbles back to her feet and moves on
shes almost hyperventilating
here the diseased townsfolk around starla stop
she looks up to see that theyve led her onto her own front yard
starla gazes up at her home the diseased have done a little remodeling
part of the front wall has been torn away replaced with some primitive thatched woodwork
the front doorway has also been partially destroyed
because of the sloppy reconstruction the roof is caved in and sloping
diseased people sit in meerkat like poses on all sides of the grants home watching out for trouble
bill out of breath arrives across the street
he can see starla standing with the diseased
he hides behind some shrubs
the diseased push starla up between them violently to the front door
starla stops at the dark hole on the front of the house
its pitch black inside
she looks back at the rotting faces behind her
and then slowly enters
starla balks at the smell
she looks beside her at the garage the wall has been torn out and this has become grants feeding area with rotten meat including some bodies in a pile
starla steps slowly forward looking around
starla can see into the shambles of a kitchen from here
bill looks at the diseased surrounding the grant home
they seem impossible to get through
bill eyes the house next door maybe twenty five feet from the grants
he makes sure no ones paying attention for a moment and he darts across the street to a parked car
the diseased dont see him
bill gazes down the street beside him
the sun is just barely beginning to rise
they dont have much time to move in the darkness
bill makes a break for the house next door
starla walks into the kitchen
cooking supplies and condiments are scattered over the floor
she spots a meat thermometer on the floor amongst other utensils
she glances out the rear window
diseased people are guarding the backyard looking away from the home
she grabs the meat thermometer
she snaps the thermometer part off the top discards it and shoves the long metal spike into the seam of her skirt
suddenly starla hears every woman in the world the song she and grant danced to earlier starting to play through tinny speakers
starla looks up through a missing section of ceiling she can see a tiny piece of grant in the bedroom above her
we should talk
bill has made his way into the backyard
he looks over at the grant home
some diseased townsfolk in the backyard could conceivably see or hear him
he tries the back door but its locked
bill notices a window slightly open
he starts to push it up
it squeaks loudly
he peers over at the diseased
they dont hear
he throws the window up further and crawls inside the home
starla stands at the base of the stairwell
the song is louder
she starts to ascend the stairs
they creak beneath her feet
bill peeks out the window careful not to be seen by the diseased humans around grants
bill can see starla in the home next door walking up the stairs
bill runs toward the stairwell here
starla looks down the hall
most of the walls have been torn away
between wooden beams starla can see grants cumbersome mass his back to her in what was once the bedroom
in front of him the song ends on the cd player
it starts into the next song on the album
grant uses one of his crusty tentacles to push the back button
every woman in the world starts over
starla walks toward him
grant keeps his back to her
starla takes in the room
photographs from their scrapbooks are all over the walls photos from their wedding and vacations and family parties
starla walks around grant giving him a decent berth
you did some real interesting decorating here
grant watches her from the corner of his sad purulent eye
starla walks by a window
look the suns starting to come up
starla starts to open the drapes
bill happens to look through the neighbors kids bedroom and to the home across the way where starla is pulling the drapes away from the window
she sees bill there
grant screeches angrily at starla
she quickly closes the drapes not letting on she saw bill
i didnt i didnt know you wanted it dark
bill walks into this young boys bedroom filled with airplanes and sports memorabilia
he peeks around the window frame at the grant bedroom window now closed to him
he makes sure his shotgun is loaded
starla tries to change the subject by walking to a wall with the photos
you like these memories huh grant
grant looks away from her
starla moves toward him almost seductively
you like being called grant dont you
grant is silent
she gets closer
i think you do
you really do
you like being grant
like when we danced
and when you
made love to me here on the bed
grant looks embarrassed
starla becomes more brazen
i know youve been alone grant
from here to there to there to here theres never been another one for you
starla almost looks as if shes about to cry out of compassion for him
grant i could help you
be with you the way you want
see i want to live
ive never had much use for this world not really
you and i together we she touches his tentacle with her fingers
he moves it back and growls a little
starla moves her trembling fingers toward him again
she sets them on his tentacle once more
he glares at her distrustfully breathing his deep sick breath
you dont trust me i know
thats why i brought you someone grant
starla looks into his eyes
hes in the house next door
bill glances down to see a diseased man looking up at him
in fact theyre all looking up at him
bill is confused
grant looks at starla with sad eyes perhaps touched
starla smiles nervously expectantly
i brought him here for you
as an offering
to prove i love you more than him
grant wraps his tentacle around starla
starla though obviously disgusted touches his face with her hand
the diseased townsfolk break down the door moving into the downstairs below bill
bill hears them approaching
he shatters the window and crawls onto a small mock balcony outside
starla moves slowly in toward grant as if to kiss him
grant looks well joyful
and then she yanks the metal spike from her skirt and jabs it into grants eye
grant screeches blind and bucking
starla slams the spike into his other eye
and she stabs him again shoving the spike into his forehead where it stays
starla leaps to the window
she throws open the drapes
kill the motherfucker
bill raises his shotgun and blasts as starla jumps away from the window
the window shatters and the shot strikes grant
he screeches swinging his tentacles aimlessly around the room in fury
one tentacle slams starla against the wall probably breaking a rib or two
another tentacle smashes the cd player squelching the song
the diseased townsfolk enter the kids bedroom rushing toward bill on the balcony
but bill wont stop
he blasts the shotgun again
grant is struck in the head
he starts slithering out of the bedroom feeling his way out
bill is out of shells
he drops his shotgun
he grabs the grenade out of the pocket on the black leather bag
starla clutching her ribs and barely able to move pulls herself up on the window
bill tosses her the grenade
she tries to catch it but misses it
it lands on the carpet
she see grants tentacles slipping away
she tries to move but shes hurt bad bleeding
the diseased gleek at bill but bill throws himself forward letting himself fall through the flimsy balustrade
bill lands hard on the lawn between the two homes
he grabs a
and stands beside the window on grants house
through the window he sees grant barreling down the stairs
bill shoots grant with the
shattering the glass
he unloads the clip into him
the diseased townsfolk surround bill grabbing him
grant using the others eyes to see snaps his tentacle forward wrapping it around bills neck raising him up
grant starla appears at the top of the stairs clutching her bloody side
she has the pin in one hand and the grenade in the other
with all her remaining effort she lobs the grenade behind grant
grants exploding flesh sends bill flying backwards
starla is thrown back
around the house the diseaseds eyes gaze lifelessly upward as they each plummet to the grass
bill unwraps whats left of the tentacle from his bruised neck and looks around at the dead diseased
grants splattered flesh is around him
bill hears a quiet rattling sound
he looks around him
and then sees down at his feet what is actually a distorted piece of grants cerebellum
sticking out of a new organic slit in the cerebellum is the quill like spore
it quivers and trembles upward its little bulbed spurs popping out
starla crawls forward to look down through the smoke most of the second floor has been blown away
her mutated husband is just a mass of flesh and alien organs
starla comes around the side of the house holding a paper towel roll to the slice on her ribs
she sees bill standing there
bill smiles too
bill and starla hobble down the town center
the leather bag is slung over bills shoulder
everything around them is dead the victims who were being feasted on as well as the various diseased
the torture is over but no life remains
bill finds an abandoned nissan maxima in the middle of the street with the keys still in it
starla over here
in the maxima now bill and starla pull around a toppled ambulance and through a spouting fire hydrant and out onto
the sun is bright and beautiful glistening on the car
bill and starla breathe more easily and smile a little as they head up this long barren road outside the city
bill and starla pass through a small block of stores
starla gazes out the window to see people real actual healthy human beings men and women and children going about their daily chores
tears come to her eyes
bill grabs starlas hand
she clenches his tightly
we can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here
the maxima pulls into the station and stops
starla and bill pile stuff up on the cashiers counter band aids gauze alcohol power bars and gatorade
the cashier rings it up staring at them because of their wounds
bill pulls money out of his pants pocket
as he does starla glances down
his arm pulls up his shirt and starla can see the black and yellow wound there on his stomach
she turns away looking around confused
bill pays smiles at the cashier
there you go
a stunned starla steps with bill out of the station moving toward the car
i i forgot
i wanted to get aspirin
she starts to move back inside
bill stops her
ill get it for you
ibuprofen or aspirin
bill smiles and goes back inside
starla moves quickly with the bag of stuff toward the car
bill pays for the aspirin and walks out with it
bill walks out the maxima is still there
bill gets in the drivers seat puts his keys into the engine
well just head up here into bishopville get checked up in the hospital
then maybe well head off to hollywood after all huh
bill turns to smile at starla
shes aiming the
at his face
tears are streaming down her cheeks
im gonna do my best not to hurt anybody you took bill
its my nature
and this is mine
starla pulls the trigger the gunshot cracks out
as the maxima sits in the lot another gunshot cracks out
then we hear the horn blaring
bills dead body is slumped over the steering wheel
starla really cant bring herself to look at it as she reaches across it and toward the door handle
the car door flips open
the horn stops blaring
and bills body is kicked out of the car sliding onto the pavement
slither starla wipes the tears away from her face
she glances out the window to see the cashier peeking out of the cashiers station
starla scoots over into the drivers seat
she shoves the car into drive
and she takes off down the road not looking back
starlas blanched and numb but the tears still keep coming
