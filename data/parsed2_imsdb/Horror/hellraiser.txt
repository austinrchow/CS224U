flood street london
sw in darkness a blood curdling cacophony the squeal of unoiled winches the rasp of hooks and razors being sharpened and worse the howl of tormented souls
above this din one particular victim yells for mercy a mixture of tears and roars of rage
by degrees his incoherent pleas are drowned out by the surrounding tumult until without warning his voice pierces the confusion afresh this time reduced to naked scream
and with the sound an image
a house number lodovico street an old three storey late victorian house with gaunt trees lining its overgrown garden
its curtains are drawn there is newspaper over its top window
the titles begin to run as we approach the house down the driveway
we move inside to the hallway
the cries are louder now
room by room we explore the empty house while the titles continue to run
it has been left empty for many years though much of its furniture remains covered in dust sheets
on the mantelpiece of one room a plaster saint
in the kitchen evidence of life here
opened tins bread bottles of spirits a glass
we move upstairs gliding along the corridor of the lower landing
the din is furious now
on the floor of one room a makeshift bed blankets strewn an open suitcase more liquor
we move up a flight and approach a room off the upper landing the door of which is ajar
the light within swings backwards and forwards spilling into the passageway
as we reach the door the screams from within halt abruptly
we can hear a bell now which has been pealing steadily throughout this opening sequence
as we move through the door the titles end
the bare bulbs in the room weve entered swing violently disorienting us
there are chains dozens of them disappearing with the darkness of the ceiling all are swinging back and forth
some end in hooks with pieces of skin and sinew adhering some are serrated others simply drip blood
the bell tolls on
on the blood spattered floor a box some six inches square which resembles an elaborate chinese puzzle box
later well learn its name and function
its called the lament configuration and its a way to raise hell
for now it remains an enigma
a hand its flesh systematically pierced with needles reaches down and picks the box up
in close up we see just what an elaborate construction it is made up of sliding panels and mysterious chambers
it is open at present its polished innards exposed
out of it a banal melody played on a hidden mechanism
the hands which belong to one of the demons a cenobite move over the box
unseen its over
delicately the hands begin to reconstruct the box sliding the well oiled parts back into place the tune simplifying with each manoeuvre
the room is getting darker
the chains are disappearing into the gloom
we see tantalizing glimpses of other figures turning from the light and fading into the darkness
we catch sight of monstrous faces but only for the briefest of moments
then theyre gone
the box is almost returned to its unopened condition
the last sounds to fade are the tune from the box and the bell
it tolls on as the final panel of the box is slid into place
the light stops swinging
the panel clicks
the tune stops
at last a long shot of the room
at the far end the window is covered with yellowed newspapers
there is dust settling through the air
otherwise it is empty
the bell fades
its as if nothing ever happened here
somewhere very quietly a creaking that could be the sound of floorboards or the low agonized gasp of a thing barely alive
the wind is blaring as we watch the door of number
from the doorstep voices
one is that of larry cotton the other his wife julia
clearly larry is attempting to get inside
we hear the sound of keys tried in the lock
its one of these
were going to freeze to death
the sound of another key tried in the lock
maybe somebody changed the lock
slightly irritated like who
just a thought ah
the key is turned
the door swings open
we see the pair on the doorstep
larry is an american in his early forties an attractive man who has lost his edge in recent years
he looks harassed he smirks too much
a little but significant corner of him is utterly defeated
julia his wife is english and looks perhaps ten years his junior
she is beautiful but her face betrays a barely buried unhappiness
life has disappointed her too of late and larry has been a major part of their disappointment
this is it
they step over the threshold
the door of the torture room creaks as the wind blows it opens an inch
from downstairs we hear julias voice
it smells damp
its just been empty a while
larry slams the front door
the torture room door creaks closed again
from below besides its an old house
he stands in the hallway not certain which way to go from here
how long since you were here
the best part of ten years
larry picks up some mail circulars mostly from behind the door then leads julia through from the hallway to explore the ground floor
i wanted to sell it off at one point after the old lady died but i couldnt get frank to agree
he opens one of the doors and looks inside
with pleasure christ
its not been touched
he continues along the passageway
he opens another door and steps into a large room
he opens one of the curtains
light pours in dust laden shafts falling on the sheeted furniture
look at this
julia lingers in the doorway
why didnt he want to sell it
dismissively i dont know
probably wanted a hideaway
he pulls a sheet off a chair
look at this stuff
the chair is ugly old fashioned
julia is unimpressed
not exactly modern
shrugs well sell it
i thought half of it was your brothers
he wont complain
he can pay off some of his creditors
larry is getting more enthusiastic about the place by the moment
he leaves the room moving past julia to explore further
you know we have to let kirsty see this place before we do anything to it
shell love it
you mean were moving in
looks at her
you dont like it
its better than brooklyn
she turns back down the hallway
he watches her then follows
youre still blaming me
you wanted to come back to london
we came back
we are hearing the tip of a debate theyve had dozens of times which immediately annoys them both
so whats the argument
cold no argument
julia wanders back to the bottom of the stairs
then starts to climb
exasperated to himself shit
julia climbs the stairs her face charged with suppressed feeling
shes sick of larry his enthusiasm depresses her his compromises anger her
whats between them is stale like this house
the door opens a fraction
larry has stepped into the kitchen to find the remains of the food we briefly glimpsed in the titles sequence now rotted and fungal
it smells to judge the expression on his face
it also puzzles him
then from above larry
he leaves the kitchen and retraces his steps to the bottom of the stairs
i hear you
he starts up the stairs
larry reaches the top of the stairs
where are you
out of sight in here
larry follows julias voice to the end of the corridor
julia is standing in a doorway
beyond the bedroom we saw in the titles sequence untouched since then
larry steps past her and throws back the blankets
wood lice scurry away
he goes to the suitcase and starts looking through it
besides clothes theres a lot else that speaks of its owner bric a brac picked up in a lifetime of adventuring handful of bullets fragments of an erotic statue coins
and notes from a dozen countries
amongst the stuff some photographs
larry peers at them
one pictures a good looking intense man in his mid to late thirties in bed with a naked chinese girl
at the door we see julia almost flinch at the name
hes been here
theres stuff in the kitchen
he must have made a hasty exit
the phone rings downstairs
thatll be kirsty
larry stands up and leaves the room moving past julia in the doorway who is left to stare down at the bed frank has slept in and the suitcase of
as we hear larry clatter downstairs it seems julias face is close to tears
the phone continues to ring
larry steps through and picks up the receiver
theres no answer
julia goes to the open suitcase and looks at the photographs
onphone is there anybody there
he puts down the phone
he goes back out into the hall
nervous that larry will return and see what shes doing julia is going through the photographs
from below theres nobody there the sound of his foot on the stairs
hurriedly she selects a photograph of frank without the girl and pockets it
larry is climbing the stairs
im surprised its even connected
the phone rings again
mission accomplished julia leaves the bedroom taking one last glance at the sweat stained sheet and the indented pillar where frank lay
a lone wood louse crawls over the sheet navigating the folds
she closes the door on the sight
downstairs the phone stops ringing
larry has picked up the phone
barely audible daddy
kirsty the daughter of larrys first marriage and his only child on the phone
she is barely twenty beautiful in an unpretensious way a dream of a girl next door
we cant see much of the room shes in at the moment the shot is too tight
i got through
where are you
i found a room
on phone what did you say
i said i found a room
we begin to draw back from kirsty now as she continues to speak to her father
shes sitting on a battered chair by the door
the room shes in is cramped and dirty
from outside the sound of trains going by
i thought you were going to stay with us for awhile
pained no dad
youd like the house
youd like my room
do you want me to come over
hastily no no
not just yet
that it does
the place now weve got a good view of it is a total dump
well i want you to see the house
im not going to change my mind dad
as she speaks she reaches forward to pull a picture tacked to the wall of a ourangoutang with breasts collaged onto it down
beneath theres a large hole in the wall which the picture was there to conceal
plaster falls from it
mouths the word great
well come over will you
see the place
i got to go look for a job
well you take care
i love you
i love you too
she puts the receiver down
as she does so the small table on which the phone is sitting collapses
she covers her face with her hand
julia is three steps from the bottom of the stairs
resigned why not
smiles hes pleased well move in sunday
a church bell rings
off screen we hear voices two men are attempting to move a bed into the house with larry masterminding the manoeuvres
we hear their efforts but we dont yet see them
our interest is in julia who is unpacking a tea chest in a room which is still full of draped furniture
were not going to get it in
watch the fucking paint work
look do you want the bed in or not
just take it slowly
oh sod you
eh chas slow it down like the man says
itll go in
famous last fucking words
julias face through this has been almost devoid of expression
shes holding so many feelings inside deep inside
now she moves from one box to another and opens it to find it full of bathroom bric a brac
she picks it up and goes through into the hallway
the bell continues to ring
the three sweating men have the bed wedged in the door
not seeing julia alright lets give it another try
sees julia do you really need this bed lady
how are you doing through there
it looks like a bombs dropped
got any beer
theres some in the fridge
nobody moves to get it
certainly julia has no intention of being waitress
she goes to the bottom of the stairs
ill get it
larry disappears through into the kitchen
julia starts up the stairs watched appreciatively by the two men in the doorway
one leans over and whispers to the other who laughs
julia glances back at them
the whisperer licks his lips the meaning of the gesture perfectly apparent
julia heads upstairs
kirsty arrives at the head of the drive
the two men are drinking beers
the bed has not been moved
she wanders down the drive towards the house
seeing kirsty its my lucky day
want to buy a bed
she moves past them attempting to insinuate herself between the bed and the door jamb
they watch enjoying her efforts
larry emerges from one of the rooms looking harassed
his face lightens as he sees his daughter
they hug each other
ill show you around when weve got this damn bed moved
is julia here
his voice lowers treat her gently huh
she hates moving
a gently chiding voice kirsty
ill be nice
you get on with the muscle work
ill make myself some coffee
kitchens through on your left kirsty kisses larry and goes through to the kitchen
larry turns back to the door
the men have been watching kirsty
larry clearly dislikes the scrutiny
st man out stared by larry looks away
the nd man is unperturbed
that your daughter
grins oafishly got her mothers looks
her mothers dead
nd mans grin fades
julias my second wife
weakly lucky man
now are we going to move the bed or not
the kitchen is chaotic
cutlery crockery utensils pans and foodstuffs have been heaped on every available surface
kirsty has found the kettle but is having difficulty turning on the tap
she struggles with it
just a rattling sound in the pipes as the system lurches into action
the pipes rattle and chug behind the plaster
the camera moves along the corridor hugging the wall
at the end of the corridor stands julia in a patch of sunlight
she has the photograph of frank in her hands
she looks intently at it
a close up of the photograph
then franks voice
can i come in
julia looks up from the photograph
a front door opens
on the step of another house stands frank with two suitcases
its raining outside hard
the rain has plastered his hair to his scalp which only emphasizes his raw good looks
hes unshaven his eyes are dark and intense
again the line she remembers can i come in
the splash of rain on the step becomes a spurt of water as we the present day
the tap has come on suddenly spraying kirsty with water
she jumps back soaked
she reaches to turn the pressure down
the men are struggling with the bed again
calls through are you o
from kitchen sure
again julia returns her gaze to the photograph
the same scene frank in the doorstep
now we the person who opened the door
its julia a younger julia her hair arranged differently her clothes brighter
it is two weeks before her marriage to larry
she looks at the man on the doorstep without a trace of recognition on her face
youre julia right
who are you
a dazzling smile im brother frank
i came for the wedding
he looks at her eyes glittering
his hold on her is almost mesmeric
there is going to be a wedding
well can i come in or not
youre very welcome
he steps inside
now he is close to her rain running down his face
we can hear his breath sense the almost intimidating intimacy of his presence
thats nice to know
pause have you got a towel
julia stares down at the photograph
off scrren kirstys voice have you got a towel
julia looks up
at the top of the stairs kirsty soaked from the tap
julia looks up and hurriedly pockets the photograph
i got soaked
theres a towel in the bath room
which is where
just to your left
kirsty ducks into the bathroom
its clear the memory of her first meeting with frank has affected her deeply
the tears that threatened earlier are close
kirsty has unbuttoned her blouse and is drying herself
did dad tell you i got a room by the way
centre of the known universe
silence from outside
she puts her head out of the bathroom julia has gone
the door of the torture room is pushed open
julia steps inside
kirsty hears the creak of footsteps on the boards above
julias behaviour puzzles her but shes not about to waste time thinking too hard about it
she starts downstairs again
we have an odd hovering point of view of julia as she steps inside the room
something about the atmosphere distresses her
there is a scratching sound
she looks down
a wood louse recalling franks foresaken bed crawls along the edge of the skirting board
she crosses to the window and tears away a little spy hole in the aged newspaper
from downstairs the voices of the bed movers
have you got it
ive got it
i told you wait
the light through the window falls on her eye
the screen becomes a white out from which emerges a bedroom with afternoon sunlight pouring between the slats of bamboo blinds
outside we can hear children playing summer games
inside a fly buzzes
julia the younger self is holding her wedding dress in front of her displaying it
i dont want to see the dress
but you said i dont want to see the dress
julia lets the dress drop a few inches in front of her
she stares at frank
you know what i want
still she doesnt let the defence that the dress offers a reminder of her imminent marriage fall
she stares though and theres an invitation in her eyes
i want you
now we frank
he is not so beraggled as in the first scene but the heat of the day has brought a sheen of sweat to his face
standing half in shadow he looks almost dangerous
now julia lets the dress drop putting it on the bed behind her
thats better frank steps towards her
what about larry forget him
frank takes hold of her
she doesnt resist him though there is barely disguised fear on her face
he puts his hand inside her blouse
in extreme close up julia blinks into the light through the window as larrys voice from downstairs calls her from her reverie
slowly will you
again a white cut from which emerges the two are naked on the bed both sweating now
beneath them the wedding dress crushed under their weight
their love making is not straight forward there is an element of erotic perversity in the way frank licks at her face almost like an animal his hold on her
too tight to be loving
the sequence escalates into a series of strange details from their locked bodies
nails digging into palms sweat rivulets running down their torsoes
and once in a while we see their faces
julia watching frank mesmerized and amused by his intensity frank almost pained by his desire to push the experience to the limit
their passion is rendered stranger still by the way the light through the window falls on their bodies making striped creatures of them
at last as their urgency increases we move up until were looking directly down on the bed
from here it is julias face we can see and the ecstasy of the moment has seized her
her arms are flung up over her head her eyes are closed as she murmurs oh my god
oh my god
oh my god
the scene whites out
julia is still staring into the light
she sobs very quietly
a whisper oh frank
downstairs larry and the men have moved the bed across the hall to the bottom of the stairs
all three are weary now and getting careless
as they start up the stairs we see trouble ahead for larry whose hand is moving closer and closer to a nail proturbing from the woodwork of the bannister
to movers will you take the weight while i take a step up
he backs towards the stairs and the nail
damn it will you take the the side of his hand is impaled bythe nail
he cries out
the weight of the bed which he cannot relinquish drives the nail deeper and gouges a long cut from the ball of his thumb to his wrist
blood pours out
whats the problem
my fucking hand
he drops his edge of the bed and disengages his hand from the nail upon which hes injured himself
he lifts his hand from which blood is pouring
you fucking ass holes
who are you calling a fucking ass hole
its this bastard bed thats your fucking problem
larry isnt listening
hes looking at the wound in his hand
he hates the sight of his own blood
any moment he may faint
but not in front of these bastards
he turns and starts up the stairs groggier by the moment
julia is standing in the middle of the room
a single dart of light through the hole she tore in the newspaper strikes her face
softly on the soundtrack the scrabbling noise of the woodlice
the bed has been put down
st man and nd man are putting on their coats
kirsty comes through from the kitchen
wheres my father
hes fucked off
mock chiding eh
hes gone upstairs
so were fucking off too
nd man takes a sheet of paper from his jacket
will you sign for the bed
larry his hand running with blood climbs the last flight of stairs
julia hears him and turns from her silent communing with the room
she crosses towards the door
larry steps inside blood pouring from his right hand which he attempts to staunch with his left hand
what have you done
i cut myself
blood has started to drip unnoticed by either of them onto the bare boards
larry looks sick his face clammy with sweat
she stares at him without a trace of feeling for him on her face
is it deep
i dont know i havent looked
you know me and blood
youre not going to faint
he leans againts the wall shit
let me see
she goes to him
he looks away as she unglues one hand from the other and looks at the wound
blood comes faster hitting the floor between them
its probably going to need stitches
im going to throw up
no youre not
the blood keeps hitting the floor
slap slap slap
well get you out into the fresh air
he is again clamping his hand over the wound as julia helps him to the door
they leave the torture room
we hear their voices receding down the passageway as we again assume that hovering view point
the floor is heavily spattered with blood
take it slowly
so damn stupid
youre done worse
ill be scarred for life
no you wont
kirsty is half way up the stairs as julia and larry head down
just an accident
hes all right
will you drive
he needs stitches
the keys are in the kitchen
kirsty heads back to the kitchen
julia helps larry towards the front door
the camera swings away from them upstairs and begins to track
we continue to track towards the torture room
downstairs the front door slams
from outside the sound of a car door slamming
an engine starts
the car drives away
we move towards the blood on the floor
as we watch it begins to disappear as if being absorbed by the room
we pan up to the wall
the plaster is not quite smooth indeed it now begins to grow restless and cracks
something begins to move in the wall
an explosion of laughter
we the remains of a rack of lamb its gravy now congealed scraps of meat adhering to the bone here and there
this is the centre piece of a table reduced to a battlefield by the guests who are laughing off screen
we pass along the table taking in dirty plates and cutlery napkins glasses and emptied wine bottles
finally we reach julia who is still sitting at the table while the others have retired to more comfortable seats
she looks utterly miserable and a little drunk
the room has been spruced up for the party
candles are burning on tables and mantelpiece there are pictures on the walls
but this is essentially cosmetic
the place has not been refurnished or re decorated
we move to the party guests
two we recognize kirsty and larry who is presently entertaining the gathering with an account of his accident
the others are new faces
an american couple bill underwood and his wife evelyn who are of an age with larry and a younger bespectacled man a work colleague of larrys steve odonnell
all are drunk
a brandy bottle sits on the table between them and half a dozen other liquer bottles besides
steve it soon becomes apparent has his eyes on kirsty
larry is half way through his hospital story gesticulating wildly as he goes through the tale much to the pleasure of the rest
his hand and lower arm are heavily bandaged
always hated the sight of my own blood
i go out like a light
goes straight to my head
anyhow this damn doctors poking around and im saying im going to pass out and hes saying no youre not no youre not
next thing i know we julia who watches her husband unamused
i wake up on the floor
gales of laughter at this
and it was him who was looking sick
probably thought youd sue
i should do it
doctors i know
and hes saying im sorry
he has picked up the brandy bottle anyone for more
come on youre only young once larry fills up her glass
to kirsty what are you drinking love
giggles ive forgotten
were on the cointreau
steve picks up the bottle
ill do it
he fills up kirstys glass
i wont be able to stand
so lie down
she casts him a sly glance
julia now stands up
would you excuse me
i think im going to go to bed
are you o
looks at his watch christ
i think its time we were away he stands
weve got celebrating to do
julia looks frosty but larry does not catch the look
kirsty does however
bill sits down
to julia it was a wonderful meal
gushing oh it was
it was wonderful
theres a chorus of approval
julia puts a smile on
im glad you enjoyed it
see you again soon
you must come round
were so happy youre back
at the door thats nice
she exits to a chorus of goodnights
kirsty in particular watches her as she makes her exit
julias behaviour confounds her
meanwhile the conversation has returned to larrys wound
does it still hurt
only when i laugh
this wins another round of laughter
julia walks along the landing while the laughter muted by distance wafts up from below
from the floor above she hears something more
she stops puzzled then starts up the second flight of stairs towards the torture room
she approaches the torture room and steps inside
the sound of laughter is considerably dimmed in here its barely audible
but there is another sound a shifting sound in the corner of the room
she reaches for the light switch and turns it on
the bulbs been broken however
she stares around the room trying to make sense of the shadows
nervously she approaches the wall on which four streaks of light from the window fall
now she looks towards the window and realizes that the newspaper has been torn as if by four fingers
her breath catches
suddenly shes afraid
she stands absolutely still eyes wide in the gloom
on the far side of the room a movement in the shadows
julia almost retreats but something keeps her staring into the murk as something the remnants of a human form made of twisted blistered strands of flesh raises its head
its squatting against the wall unable to lift itself into a standing position
its eyes however have life in them and hunger
this though hes unrecognizable is frank
a pained whisper julia
oh my god
dont look at me
who are you
i said dont look
she looks away
tell me who you are
julias face registers horror and disbelief
its really me
what happened to you
on the floor
it brought me back
back from where
just help will you
please god help me from downstairs dimly laughter
larry has just told another story
general drunken laughter
kirsty stands up
youre not going
she staggers a little bit
need any help
i am house trained
covered in embarrass ment no
its round on the left i know
she steps out into the hallway
she starts up the stairs
she smiles to herself thinking of steve
frank in the corner of the room watches julia who is still at the door
the sound of kirsty downstairs closing the bathroom door
you cant let me stay like this
what do you want me to do
the blood brought me this far
i need more of the same
or ill slip back
julias lace as she stares at frank once more
she is appalled at the choice before her
a plea you have to heal me
kirsty smiles at herself in the bathroom mirror turns off the tap opens the door and steps out onto the landing
she takes a step along the landing then realizes that theres somebody ahead of her in the darkness
from the floor above a soft sigh
julia moves out of shadow into a patch of patterned light splashing up the stair well
the effect recalls her memory of her lovemaking with frank
the light makes her look strange ominous
oh its you
julia doesnt smile are you all right
do we read murder in julias eyes
kirsty is uneasy
suddenly a voice from the floor below
kirsty is relieved at the interruption
calls down im here
i thought wed lost you
calls down im coming
to julia sleep well
julia is left on the landing as kirsty heads downstairs
the station is deserted but for kirsty and steve who are sitting waiting for the last train
you know i do know the way home
not that late
i want to see you home
lightly all right
if theres a train
what do we do if there isnt
kirsty and steve are walking
why dont you stay at larrys house
theres plenty of room
yeah theres room
and theres julia
shes so damn
oh i dont know
steve stops walking
i beg your pardon
lightly there ya go
imitates his tone i beg your pardon
were not all frigid
kirsty has turned to look at him
both of them are aware where the banter is leading smiles play on their faces as they speak
its not what i heard
moves closer to her well youve just been talking to the wrong people
he kisses her with considerable feeling
larry snores loudly
julia lies beside him wide awake staring at the ceiling
larry turns over muttering to himself
the door opens
julia is standing there in her night gown
frank raises his wretched head
julia stares at the thing moving in the shadow
the door opens
julia steps out of the house and starts towards the street
as she does so she glances round
we approach the window knowing that frank watches behind it
julia heads off down the street
the din of a lunchtime restaurant with all the tables full and everyone hungry
in the middle of the melee kirsty is valiantly trying to do six things at once
somebody wants their order taken somebody else wants more lager somebody else is complaining
shes doing her best but losing the battle
she serves a table with their food and then starts back to pick up another order
as she does so shes harangued from every side
excuse me miss id like some more lager
in a moment
did you hear me
kirsty starts back to the counter
as she does so somebody elses voice cuts through the din
hey sex bomb she wheels round
you keep your sees steve oh
i just called in
how about tonight
i dont finish till twelve
im a late riser
what do you have to do to get some service around here
catch you later
by contrast a quiet bar
discreet music a well dressed clientele
several couples occupy booths
other solitary drinkers are at the bar
amongst them julia
now we see her more closely we realize shes gone to some considerable effort to make herself ravishing
theres nothing crude about the change its a subtle transformation which shows off her considerable beauty
she drinks soda water
she has an admirer
sitting alone at one of the tables is a middle aged man by the name of prudhoe a nervous slightly paunchy individual
she glances over at him
his eyes dont leave her for a moment
hes trying his best to get the courage to approach her
she looks away and concentrates on her drink
now she takes out a cigarette fumbling for it
her hands are trembling slightly
she lights the cigarette draws on it and as she does so she seems to make up her mind that shes not the equal of it
she stubs the cigarette out puts cash on the bar for her drinks and gets up to leave
suddenly prudhoes at her side
not much fun is it
i wonder maybe
hes so nervous he can barely speak
as were both on our own
we could have one drink together
julia looks at him
he seems to almost be offering himself to her
theres a long pause while she tries to make up her mind
then why not
the smile works wonders
prudhoes nerves diminish somewhat
julias simply increase now that shes committed herself
again she opens the pack of cigarettes as prudhoe calls the barman over
to julia what are you drinking
i try not to drink at lunch time
makes me sleepy in the afternoon
you like to keep a clear head eh
to barman one soda one whisky
to julia i do it anyway
no will power
got a busy afternoon
looking straight at him that depends
he stares at her not certain he interprets her correctly
she stares back
then the tiniest of smiles which he scarcely believing his luck returns
the camera moves across the room
we can hear franks ragged breathing and as we move in we see on the floor beside him the box the lament configuration its sides gleaming
frank still squatting on the floor taps a tattoo on the bare boards with his skeletal fingers
then voices outside julia laughs
he raises his head
julia opens the front door
she is still very nervous fumbling with the keys
prudhoe stands a pace behind her
they step inside
julia closes the door you know its not often i
theres a first time for every thing
i suppose thats right
you want something to drink
im already way over my usual limit
you know its funny
i feel like ive known you for years
he approaches her his gestures made slightly clumsy by the alcohol hes drunk
he kisses her
she presses him off her
oh come on
he takes hold of her breast its what you brought me here for isnt it
i just think wed be better off upstairs
franks view from the corner of the room
we hear the sound of julia and prudhoes approach up the stairs
this your place
lets not talk about it
no personal details right
you know youre incredible julia opens the door
come on in
make yourself at home
she steps inside
prudhoe does as hes instructed
he stares at the bare floor as julia closes the door behind him
theres no bed
i prefer the floor
first time for everything right
julia moves towards him why dont you take off your jacket
yeah why dont i
she slips the knot of his tie
we can hear her pulse on the soundtrack
she glances over prudhoes shoulder
he follows her gaze but she diverts him with a peck on the cheek
takes over his undressing why dont you do the same
maybe i will
prudhoe now starts to shed his jacket and trousers trying not to take his eyes off julia for an instant
we watch from franks p
as he drops his underwear
he still wears his shirt which he starts to unbutton
we move back into a tighter shot
voice slightly slurred you know youre very beautiful
you know you are
loveliest woman i ever set eyes on
prudhoe stops unbuttoning his shirt
too much drink
better empty my bladder
she steps out of the way so that he can cross to the door
ill be a moment
as he moves to the door she throws a piece of cloth off a hammer which lies beside the wall
prudhoe takes hold of the door handle
turns it its stuck
the doors stuck
before he can turn she hits him on the back of the head
he doesnt fall but the blow sends blood down the back of his shirt
to avoid the following blow he stumbles blindly towards the wall but julias not going to be stopped now
he holds the back of his head dazed apologetic pitiful while she moves towards him
she eclipses him
im so sorry
she raises the hammer
i dont understand
she strikes him
he slides down the wall his jaw broken blood pouring from his face
then the twitches stop
she drops the hammer and stares down at the corpse
the room sighs
in the corner franks shadowy form leans forward
dont look at me
julia backs towards the door as the broken skeletal form crawls out of darkness to claim its sustenance
julia steps out onto the landing and leans against the wall waves of sheer relief breaking over her
in the room behind her terrible sounds of feeding
julia steps into the bathroom and looks at herself in the mirror
blood is spattered on her face her hands are similarly stained
she is trembling from head to foot
stripping off her blouse and flinging it over the side of the bath she douses her face neck and breasts with cold water
then she stares up at her face again examining it
she can scarcely believe what shes done
she crosses the landing and climbs the stairs to the torture room
she opens the door
as she does so frank retreats into the shadows
we are granted a fleeting glimpse of him his body fuller than before but still horribly vulnerable
julia looks at prudhoes corpse
a trail of blood leads away from it into the darkness
the body itself is a grotesquely misshapen husk now the muscle and fat withered the eyes sunk into the skull the lips drawn back to expose the gums
a ghostly sight
julia looks across at frank who is no longer sitting but standing in the shadows
his voice stronger do i disgust you
she doesnt reply
he stretches his arm into a passage of light
his flesh glistens and pulses
its making me whole again
he turns his arm over for her appreciation
every drop of blood you spill puts more flesh on my bones
and we both want that dont we
she stares unable to move
come here damn you
i want to touch you
still she doesnt move
more softly come to daddy
i only want to touch
she takes a step towards his outstretched arm
his fingers touch her face
she steels herself against them
now he starts to trace the line of her jaw stroking her
now her lips caressingly
suddenly a sound from downstairs
the front door is opened
from below sweetheart
julia withdraws from his touch from below where are you
shot from the stairs of larry
he looks up the flight
he takes a step towards the stairs
julia takes a step backwards her foot hitting prudhoes corpse
larry is still at the bottom of the stairs
are you there
for a moment it looks as though hes going to climb the stairs then he thinks better of it and goes through to the back of the house
julia has wrapped the corpse of prudhoe up in its clothes and is now lifting it
the body is lighter now having been drained of nourishment
its head lolls back and its dentures drop out hitting the floor loudly
no sound from below
she backs out of the room with her burden
franks arm reaches for the fallen dentures and peers at them
whos a pretty boy then
soft laughter from the darkness
julia pushes the door of the junk room which is on the upper landing open
inside a chaos of tea chests and bric a brac
she lays the body down
larry has come through to look for julia
he hears a noise above
he looks up
he leaves the kitchen
again larry steps into the hallway and gazes up the stairs
are you there
he starts up
julia steps into the bathroom and then locks the door behind her
larry ascends to the top of the stairs
from bathroom im here
at the door sweetheart
ive been calling you
he tries the door
are you all right
just feeling a bit sick
julia still trembling sits on the edge of the bath
ill be o
just leave me be a while
can i get you anything
maybe a brandy
ill be down in a minute she listens as his footsteps recede down the landing and stairs
then she crosses to the mirror and tries to erase the signs of panic
she puts a comb through her hair and adjusts her blouse
that done she unbolts the door and steps out into the landing
she doesnt go down however but up back to the torture room
she opens the door
very softly frank
a crunching sound in the shadows
franks hand opens dropping the pieces of prudhoes dentures which he has crushed onto the floor in a rain of plastic teeth
im hurting hurting
are beginning to work again
maybe two julias face registers no horrer at this
to heal me completely
then we can be away from here before they come looking
its only a matter of time before they find ive slipped them
i have to get away from here
from downstairs larry
are you all right
julia crosses to the door and calls down
just a moment
put on some music will you babe
she returns to her conversation with frank
obedient as ever
keep your voice down
she crosses to close the door
when she turns round hes in front of her silhouetted against the window his half formed face terrifying in the gloom
suddenly he reaches out and catches hold of her arm
she gasps in pain
dont want babe to hear
you wont cheat me will you
youll stay with me
then we can be together the way we were before
we belong to each other now for better or worse
he lets go of her
she goes to the door and leaves him locking it behind her
we move close to franks face
he licks his skinned lips with a bloody tongue
the thunder carries over to a dream
we are in the dining room of number except that everything is once more shrounded in sheets
we cut to kirsty moving through the room her face pale her hair glued to her forehead with sweat
somewhere a bell is ringing
on the dinner table a form is covered in a sheet
its clear that the shape is human
she reaches the table and looks at the body
suddenly blood begins to seep through the shroud beginning at the head eyes and mouth then spreading across the body
there are sobs beneath the shroud
she reaches for it to snatch it off the body
the blood has almost turned the sheet scarlet
we glimpse only a moment of whatd beneath a naked body scarlet and shining with blood from head to foot
her scream becomes louder as we steve sits bolt upright in bed while kirsty yells
the sheet is snatched off him
he looks across the room to see kirsty at the end of the bed with the sheet in her hand
what are you doing
kirstys eyes are still closed
her eyes open
she looks down at the sheet shes snatched from the bed and drops it in horror
what was that about
kirsty weak with fear just shakes her head
a phone is ringing
larry crosses the hallway bleary eyed and disappears from sight
the phone is picked up
julia lies in bed the pillow empty beside her
shes wide awake staring at the ceiling
downstairs the murmur of larrys voice
frank stands in the corner of the room breathing softly in the shadows
larry is on the phone
its all right
kirsty is on the phone
steve sits up in bed having reclaimed the sheet
i just wanted to be sure you were o
you sleep well
kirsty on phone yeah
i love you honey
kirsty on phone i love you too
larry puts down the phone
larry returns to the bedroom
who was it
he goes into the bedroom
we pan up the second flight of stairs
frank is sitting at the top in the shadows
soft as a breath kirsty
the front door is closed by julia
a man stands in the hallway another victim
he is as nervous as youre sure were not going to be interrupted quite sure
only i like to be careful
a shock cut to the naked victim thrown back against the wall from julias hammer blow
before he can even slide down the wall frank is upon him
we dont linger but cut away to as julia closes the door her face devoid of emotion we see the victims body on the floor with franks hands oh its
head draining out its energies
julia sits sipping a drink her face still unreadable
frank is standing in the shadows
the victims body is in the middle of the room
id like some clothes
and maybe a cigarette
then you tell me
you explain what happened to you
we pan across the walls as frank speaks
i wanted access to experiences
that only they could offer
thats what they call themselves
theyre not human
maybe they were once but theyre not now
they rearrange their own flesh for pleasure
weve moved across to frank now
he is dressed in loose fitting jacket and trousers through which his blood is seeping
he smokes taking great pleasure in the experience
and the box
frank picks up the box
vague tantalizing forms move over the surface like ghosts
it cost me a fortune
all i had
its a puzzle you see
you solve it and the cenobites come through
sometimes i think theyre just behind the walls
he turns the box over
the lacquer catches the light
so they cheated you in the lacquer we see oiled bodies moving
its difficult to be sure what the forms signify
is this torture or some elaborate pleasure
they kept to their bargain
they gave me experiences id never forget
the images in the lacquer are becoming clearer and they are appalling
flesh torn open blood running across sweating flesh hooks and terrible machines
but their pleasure was my pain
his voice has begun to tremble
the images in the box are more horrific by the moment
and flowing between them highly distorted the cenobites faces and that of frank screaming and screaming
he cant speak for a moment
after a pause he goes on his voice heavy
my body was forfeit
but my spirit
they left that here
in the boards
in the walls
watching the world but never able to touch it
and the blood let you out
there are ways to resurrection
bloods one of them
i wont let them take me back julia
julia looks at the horrors in the box and understands his desire
i want to be whole and then get out he lifts the box up
i wont let them take me
you wont have to
well be gone
somewhere theyll never find us
theres a rumble of thunder
not in the whole wide world
more thunder and the sound of heavy rain against the windows
the television is on
larry and julia are sitting on the couch
larry is watching a boxing match
he has consumed several beers the cans are beside his feet and theres another in his hand
julia reads a magazine glancing up at the screen to see the match getting more heated
blood is starting to flow
is this upsetting you
ive seen worse
larry looks at her
are you all right
only ill turn it off theres a sudden raising of shouts from the screen as one of the boxers hits the canvas
larry turns his attention back to the match
and hes down
the thunder rolls on
the lightning finds its way through the holes in the newspaper
frank is watching through the window his face occasionally washed with light
his hand on the window frame taps out the same tattoo hes tapped out before
he turns away from the window and his foot catches the box
it rolls across the floor
the boxing match is heating up again
and now hes in trouble hes really in trouble what was that
julia looks up from her magazine
the violence on the screen is horrific as swollen faces burst beneath punches
larry stands up
maybe i left a window open she gets up and crosses to the door
ill go see
ill do it
he opens the door and steps out into the hallway
in such tight close up we cant sec that frank has in fact left the torture room we see his features register that somebody is coming
larry is climbing the stairs
it was nothing
larry has reached the top of the stairs
he looks up the next flight
whats wrong with you
shes desperate to stop him climbing to the torture room
i just hate the thunder
he crosses to her
he puts his arms around her
he hugs her tight kissing her lightly
the thunder shakes the house
theres nothing to be afraid of
he kisses her neck his hands restless on her
ill just go check upstairs
he kisses her again
she in order to distract him kisses him back
her passion is artificial but he doesnt register that
dont go upstairs
come with me then
he starts up the stairs
he reaches the top of the stairs
first he throws open the junk room
lightning flashes on boxes inside
then he moves towards the torture room
the thunder rolls more loudly
she follows him along the landing desperate to stop him
he throws open the door
lightning floods the room
she stands beside him at the door
we must have rats
she looks back down the stairs
wheres frank gone
larry turns to her holding her again on the threshold of the torture room
he kisses her much harder this time a sexual kiss
lets go down
ill make it better
he kisses her again
a shadow moves across the screen as the door opens and larry puts on the light
he has hold of julias hand
he leads her inside
she sits on the bed illuminated by the light from the landing and the occasional flicker from the window
larry kneels between her legs and kisses her breasts his eyes closed
julia glances into the shadows of the room
she senses franks presence
he starts to unbutton her dress
shes distracted by her suspicions he has his hands against her almost before she realizes whats happening
we have her p
as she looks around the room
the dressing table the wardrobe the curtains at the window
does something move in the shadows
a flash of lightning
larry gets onto the bed and draws her against him kissing her
this is not the intense slightly dangerous love making she experienced with frank but a fumbling slightly foolish exchange
larry is so wrapped in attempting to make the right moves he doesnt register the fact that julias attention is elsewhere
now we have a p
from the far side of the room of the two figures on the bed the only sound the thunder and larrys murmured words of seduction which we can barely make
i love you honey
i love you
neither of them have undressed fully theres just a tangle of clothes around them which removes any trace of eroticism from the scene
a close up of julias head laid on the pillow shows just how uninvolved she is while larry works eyes closed
julia looks down the length of her husbands body
the door of the wardrobe swings open
frank is watching
she registers horror
larry is oblivious to all of this of course
we have a close up of frank watching the love making
now he steps out of the wardrobe
julia makes a moan of horror which larry takes as enthusiasm
i love you
from julias p
we see the form of frank shamble towards the lovers
from franks p
we see the lovers on the bed larrys back vunerable
julia seems to realize what he intends
larry barely hears her
frank is at the very end of the bed now and julia becomes highly agitated
no you mustnt
larry stops his love making
looks at her huh
whats wrong with you
almost sobbing please
i cant bear it
larry is angered and utterly perplexed at this
he disengages his arms from around her
as frank retreats
larry rolls off julia
the wardrobe door closes
i dont understand you
one moment youre all over me the next its dont touch me
he sits on the edge of the bed
i just dont understand
he gets up and leaves the bedroom
julia remains where she is
we have a shot of the bed and her upon it from franks end of the room
she stares at the wardrobe
through the crack of the open door frank stares back
a flicker of lightning illuminates his face his skeletal grin
softly beneath the assault of the rain on the roof we hear laughter
kirsty and larry are sitting eating a meal together in an intimate restaurant
larry has little appetite to judge by his plate
he looks as if he hasnt slept for several nights
kirsty by contrast is sparkling maybe we should never have come back
maybe you should give it some time
skirting her real feelings shes not like mom
i dont know
i thought that was what you liked about her
you dont like her at all do you
the straight forward question silences kirsty for a moment
she wants to be delicate with her fathers feelings but honest at the same time
i dont know her
larrys face is full of the desire for reassurance
kirsty tries to offer it
if you love her she must be worth loving
just give me some time
larry nods a weak smile on his face she doesnt even want to leave the house
its like shes waiting for something
i dont know
i dont know
its beyond me
hesitant would you
maybe call round sometime
try to make friends
maybe all she needs is some company
frank is standing at the top of the stairs dressed in his stained suit
julia is a few steps down staring up at him
you cant love him
so wheres the harm
i said no
then find me somebody else before they come looking
she looks at him
a wind blows carrying autumn leaves before it
and on the wind the distant pealing of bells
julia is at the door turning the key in the lock
beside her a third sacrificial lamb balding and excitable
his name is sykes
julia opens the door
at the corner of the street now kirsty
she watches puzzled
a long shot of the house from kirstys p
the man on the step seems to having second thoughts
julia speaks with him
we can hear none of this exchange but julia manages to coax him inside
she closes the door behind them
kirsty stands bewildered by what shes seen
from the top of the stairs we watch julia lead sykes upstairs
i get lonely sometimes
kirsty starts towards the house
in the corner of the room frank stands tapping out the rhythm with his fingers
its colonel bogey and now he hums it too
outside the door a footfall
the humming stops
julia opens the door
kirsty starts down the path
sykes is looking at julia
what is this
frank moves in the corner
sykes catches the motion from the corner of his eye
frank steps from the shadows
julia hits him with the hammer
kirsty hears sykes scream
then steps back from the doorstep and looks up at the house
in the room pandemonium
sykes blood pouring down his face flails out at julia
the hammer flies from her hand
he lunges for the door but she manages to kick it closed
christ help me
kirsty makes her way around the back of the house
sykes has taken hold of julia and is using her as a shield against frank whos is bearing down upon him
for the first time we see franks true colours where julias concerned to frank dont
casually frank throws julia aside
she falls sobbing
frank descends on sykes
sykes scream covers the sound of kirsty forcing the back door open
she steps inside
frank has sykes face to the wall
sykes is sobbing now
the room is covered in blood
to julia get out of here
she picks herself up
to julia please
dont let him kill me
julia leaves closing the door
frank seizes hold of sykes neck his fingers entering the flesh either side of his neck vertebrae
kirsty moves through the house and starts to climb the stairs
half way up the stairs the scream stops
she climbs the rest of the way surrounded by a graveyard hush
a soundless slowed shot as sykes his face wasted by franks feeding breaks from franks hold and lunges for the door
kirsty starts up the second flight of stairs
the same slowed soundless horror as sykes reaches the door
frank is a pace behind him
kirsty reaches the top as the door from inside the room
sykes pulls it open in real time and accompanied by the most horrific shriek sykes flings himself from the torture room
the flesh is hanging off his face his eyes bulge in terror
seeing kirsty he starts towards her
behind him frank his body glistening
he catches hold of sykes by the neck
sykes shrieks stop
the eyes glaze over
the body judders as death claims it
then frank drops the corpse and looks up at kirsty
oh my god
she starts to back away down the stairs
he takes a step towards her
keep your fucking distance
christ what have you done with her
shes still backing away
hes still advancing
its uncle frank
come to daddy
her puzzlement however has slowed her retreat and now frank reaches for her
at the last moment she backs away again but hes after her in a beat and seizes hold of her
get the fuck off me
he drags her back up the stairs
he pushes her ahead of him into the torture room
he closes the door
she has retreated as far from him as she can get
he advances on her
dont touch me
or so help me what
what will you do
what can you do
pause theres nothing to be frightened of
frank has closed in on her by now
he lakes hold of her face
i bet you make your daddy proud dont you
this isnt happening
i used to tell myself that
used to try and pretend i was dreaming all the pain
but why kid yourself
some things have to be endured
take it from me
and that makes the pleasures so much sweeter
as he leans in to kiss her she snatches hold of the pus and bloodstained shirt thats glued to his abdomen and pulls
theres a flow of fluids
franks head is thrown back and he screams
she slips from beneath his grasp
but hes after her in a moment his hand catching her blouse
his fingers rake her bare skin
she stumbles reaches out for the wall which is slick with sykes blood
her hand slides over it
she falls heavily
roaring frank comes in pursuit of her
on the floor in front of kirsty the box
its a poor weapon but its all shes got
as he comes after her again she stands up and delivers a blow to his head with the box
she races for the door
but hes after her
he strikes her
shes thrown against the wall
hes furious now
strikes her again
she cannot survive much more
she raises the box to retaliate
frank sees what shes holding
his attack stops
give that to me
she dimly realizes that she has a bargaining tool
one last time
give me the box
you want it
the monsters eyes glitter
fucking have it
she throws the box
it sails past frank and smashes through the window
he goes to the window
she takes her chance
shes out of the door in a moment
kirsty propels herself out of the room and down the stairs while frank vents his anger above her
she flings open the front door and pitches herself bleeding and bruised into the daylight beyond
as she stumbles away down the path she sees the box at her feet in a litter of broken glass
she picks it up and continues to run
a series of shots from kirstys p
as she staggers along the street
the sound track whines the image threatens to be eclipsed by darkness
people stare at her as she runs
a child points
finally the camera slows
she stands still
a voice off camera are you all right
the camera swings giddily around in the direction of the speaker
a woman comes into view
do you need any help
as she speaks the picture fades to white
the whiteness continues to fill the screen
distant incoherent voices are heard and the thump of blood in the inner ear
then darkness seeps into the whiteness patterns like rorschach inkblots ambiguous yet interpretable as sexual or horrific imagery
with the darkness soaking over the scene like blood through the sheet in her first dream fragments of franks previous dialogue
come to daddy
this isnt happening
some things have to be endured
the darkness is filling the screen take it from me
now total darkness
come to daddy
and suddenly she wakes
kirsty is lying in a bed in a private room
a nurse is at her bedside monitoring her condition
she goes to the door
ill get the doctor
kirsty tries to sit up
her head hurts badly
as she achieves a sitting position the door opens
the nurse returns with a doctor
approaching the bed so
youre back with us
i think so
how are you feeling
you took quite a beating
do you remember what happened
she looks at him uncertain of where to start
i want to speak to my father
nods of course
well bring you a telephone
the nurse exits
the doctor brings the box from his pocket
maybe thisll jog your memory
he lays it on the bed
she stares at it her expression betraying nothing
i had the devils own job getting it out of your hand
does it ring any bells
she shakes her head
do you want it left
he offers her a reassuring smile
theres no serious damage
and youre safe here
he leaves the room
kirsty picks up the box tentatively
she turns it over in her hand examining it
frank is standing in the shadows
he is wearing a fresh shirt
julia watches him
downstairs the telephone rings
julia is very nervous now desperate even
shell tell them everything
i dont think so
shell want larry first
thats probably her now
or the police
dont you care
theres very little i can do about it
maybe we should just leave like this
look at me
like well we cant just stay here i need a skin
then we leave kirsty is sitting up in bed
on the bedside table a telephone
she is now thoroughly engrossed in the problems of the box
her fingers speed over the surfaces looking for some way in testing its strength
suddenly a click
her face lights up with pleasure as she slides a part of the box open revealing new intricacies
and to accompany the revelation a tinkling tune
its a musical box
the light beside the bed flickers but she doesnt notice
the door opens
its the nurse
any luck with your father
shakes her head hes probably got a meeting
i called a friend of mine
hes coming is that o
the nurse exits
as she does go the light flickers again
the box clicks
a new facet is revealed
the front door closes
larry stands in the hall
julia comes down the stairs
she looks pale even ill
i dont know where to begin
what are you talking about
its better you see for your self she turns and starts up the stairs
kirsty has opened more of the box
the tune is more complex now
somewhere a bell has started to ring
now she works the final mechanism of the box
the bedside light flickers and goes out
the bell rings
light pours out of the box
she drops it shocked
the bedside light comes on again
she looks up
in the wall opposite the end of her bed a very narrow doorway has simply opened in the wall
leaving the box on the bed she gets up and goes to the gap
as she approaches she hears the distant rhythmical sob of a baby
she stands at the doorway
we look back at her a diminutive figure framed against a shot of light from way way down the corridor
the sobbing goes on
kirsty stares down the corridor which is lit brightly in some places and is absolutely dark in others not certain of whether to venture down it or not
she glances towards the door of her room from the other side of which comes the reassuring sound of the hospital going about its business
whats to fear
she steps into the corridor
the walls rise into darkness on either side of her their surfaces like the interior of a pyramid pitted with age and rotting away
she starts towards the sobbing child bare feet on the impacted earth of the passageway
the sobbing gets louder as she advances her form disappearing entirely as she passes through the intermittent darkness
once she glances back towards the hospital room to reassure herself that its still there
it is though its no more than a sliver of light at the far end of the passageway
she advances a few more paces
the atmosphere is growing denser smoke thickens the air
then a light glows at the other end of the corridor
the sound of the sobbing child ceases
she stops walking
ahead the smoke clears and the light brightens and we see a creature the engineer hanging in the space between the walls
it is in silhouette against the light but we can see enough to know that it resembles no earthly animal
its vast black limbs hold it suspended above the corridor clinging to the stone
its front limbs vestigial by comparison hang down from beneath its vast head
its tail is curled over its back
kirstys expression registers this horror
the engineer moves into the light
its irises narrow to slits
from the tail a vast sting oozing pus like venom glides into view
and then it comes at her advancing along the corridor by bracing its legs against the walls
its breath is a growl in its belly until it moves into darkness when all sound from it ceases only to erupt again as it finds the light
kirsty turns and starts to run
it comes after her at speed
darkness light darkness light roars and silence its jaws spill its thick saliva its eyes gleam
kirsty runs blindly down the corridor back towards the safety of the hospital room
but its very close on her heels lingering as she comes within a few yards of the room it closes on her
she flings herself through the door with the engineers breath on her back and turns the doorway has gone
the wall is sealed
she approaches the wall
the engineer scratches on the other side
then she realises that the bell is still ringing
and theres a foul smell in the air
she looks around
shes not alone
standing across the room from her lit by a strange phosphorescence that has no visible source are four extraordinary figures
they are cenobites
each of them is horribly mutilated by systems of hooks and pins
the garments they wear are elaborately constructed to marry with their flesh laced through skin in places hooked into bone
the leader of this quartet has pins driven into his head at inch intervals
at his side a woman whose neck is pinned open like a vivisection specimen
accompanying them is a creature whose mouth is wired into a gaping rectangle the exposed teeth sharpened to points and a fat sweating monster whose eyes are covered by dark
when the lead cenobite speaks we recognise the voice as that of the creature from the beginning of the film
kirsty stares in amazement
where the hell did you come from
the cenobite gestures
the box is lying on the bed
you opened it
its just a puzzle box
its a means to summon us its called the lament con figuration
who are you
explorers in the further regions of experience
demons to some
angels to others
well i didnt mean to open that thing
you can go back wherever you came from
at this the creature with the wired open jaw chatters like a mad monkey
this isnt for real
you solved the box
now you must come with us
taste our pleasures
the chattering cenobite steps towards her
dont touch me
the door opens
kirstys face floods with relief
steve does not register the cenobites presence however
thank god you came
what happened to you
he steps between the cenobites
they want to take me what things
to kirsty he doesnt see us or hear us
we belong to you kirsty
and you to us
dont let them take me steve i wont let anybody take you
he starts to walk towards her but the creature in the dark glasses takes a hooked rod from its back and puts the hook to steves neck
steves hand moves to the place he makes a small sound of pain
the cenobite takes off its glasses to see its trick better
the eyes beneath are sewn shut
it pulls a little more on the hook
if he takes another step we open his throat
to steve please go steve
ill be o
im going to go see dad
hell look after me protesting what did i say
will you go damn you
mystified steve retreats a step
ill come back later huh
still puzzled steve crosses to the door
its time we were away
almost crying let me alone will you
no tears please
its a waste of good suffering
the chatterer comes for her
as it does so desperation brings a plan to kirstys head
no time for argument
you did this before right
to a man called frank cotton
but he escaped you
nobody escapes us
ive seen him
is that so
and what are you proposing
ill take you to him
then you take him instead of me
back wherever you come from
the cenobite stares at her unblinking
but if you cheat us
the sound of the engineer scratching on the other side of the wall
the plaster cracks violently
well tear your soul apart
we cut back to the cracking plaster which cracks further
we hear steves voice and pan back into the room
the door opens
kirsty and the cenobites have gone
steve is there with the nurse
she was trembling all over
id better go look for her
the nurse heads for the door
maybe shes gone back to her he looks round
the nurse has gone
his eyes have alighted on the box which is lying on the bed
he picks it up
lights burn in the house upstairs and down
julia sits in front of the dressing table mirror
she has a glass of whisky in front of her
she sips from it studying her face in the mirror
weve seen her in many moods through the story now we see a mingling of fear and exhilaration on her face
she gets up
laid out on the bed is of all things her wedding gown
steve drives towards lodovico street scanning the streets for sign of kirsty
as his car drives past kirsty turns a corner
he does not see her
kirsty hurries along the street
the wind is chilly
sometimes she hears a bell in it
steve drives up to the house
the lights are still burning
he gets out of the car and hurries down the path
he knocks on the door
theres no reply
two shadowy naked figures stand face to face in the bedroom
we can see no detail of their features
we move down their bodies
they are standing in a shining pool of blood
steve starts round the back of the house
the male of the couple pads towards the bedroom door leaving a trail of blood behind him
we can still see very little of the man
kirsty turns the corner of the street and starts down it
the wind is strong now
it is full of sibilant whispers hurrying her along
kirsty reaches the doorstep
as she does so the whispers die away completely
she beats on the door
she beats again more urgently
julia steps onto the landing
we can hear kirsty shouting on the step
we hear a voice off screen
is it frank or larry
impossible to be sure
kirsty still beats on the door
please answer me
please the door is suddenly opened
julia is standing there
its very late
whats the problem
stepping inside i have to see my father
theres no need to shout
we pan across the table
at the end of the table sits larry
the light is behind him
his features are shadowy
but we can see that he is badly bruised
we hear the womens voices off screen
you look terrible
have you had an accident
i was here this afternoon
i saw everything
im sorry i dont follow
what was there to see
kirsty doesnt answer but walks through into the dining room
kirsty sees larry at the table
she starts to sob i thought something might have
she glances round at julia who has also entered
to larry i have to talk to you
larry leans forward and into the pool of light over the table
he looks much the worse for wear
his flesh is raw and bruised
there is blood at his neck and hairline
its all right sweetheart
julias told me everything and its all right
you dont understand
your brother frank hes here in the house
and hes whatever frank did was his error
and its finished with now
smiles hes gone
he was insane baby a mad dog
i put him out of his misery kirsty stares at larry while in her head she hears the cenobites voice
well tear your soul apart
ill go to the police when im feeling stronger
try and find some way to make them understand though god knows i dont really understand myself
did he hurt you
kirsty is dumb with horror at her situation
leans back poor frank
hes better off dead
i dont believe it
im afraid its true
tears in her eyes i want to see
no you dont
to julia show her
kirsty turns away from larry
julia leads her out into the hallway
larry still sitting at the table
his fingers drum a familiar tattoo
beneath his breath he hums colonel bogey
julia pushes open the door of the torture room
it creaks wide
lying on the floor inthe middle of the room is a skinned corpse in a tangle of torn clothing
there is blood everywhere
that too steams
kirsty is revolted
she steps away from the door back down the landing
the bell has begun to ring again distantly and there is the sound of wings in the air thousands of birds beating on the other side of the wall
kirsty starts down the stairs again
where are you going
kirsty doesnt reply
she merely hurries away
calling after her you leave this to us you hear me
well deal with the police kirsty descends the stairs
larry has stepped out of the dining room and is moving to intercept her as she makes her way to the front door
the sound of wings and bells and a terrible slow thunder which underpins it all mounts in volume
larry snatches at her arm
where are you going
i have to get out
she shrugs off his arm
the thunder is increasing
stay with me julia is on the stairs watching this exchange
its all right
really it is
he touches her face fondly
i cant stay
she goes to the door
come to daddy
she hesitates at the door and turns
the thunder fills kirstys head as she stares at larry who has opened his arms to her
come to daddy
her gaze moves up to julia who is on the stairs
no damn you mouths oh my god
everything is slowing down
the bells and the thunder fill the soundtrack
larry smiles as kirsty moves towards him
tears have begun to fill her eyes
she searches for him
his smile decays as he realizes her objective
her nails rake his cheek
the flesh puckers and tears along the brow
the mask of stolen flesh he wears slips a little and franks twisted features come into view
kirsty screams as frank lunges for her
the lights in the hallway flicker and threaten to go out
kirsty avoids franks blow but in doing so allows him to get between her and the front door
his torn face flapping he opens his jacket the interior of which is blood stained and pulls a knife from the lining
suddenly julia is behind her gripping hold of her hair
frank advances on kirsty but in the last moment before the fatal stab kirsty twists avoiding the blow
julia shrieks and stumbles forward the knife gleaming as its buried to the hilt in her side
kirsty slips from between them
julia collapses into franks arms
he holds her up
kirsty makes a dive for the front door but frank lets julia slip and intercepts kirsty
julia falls back against the wall dying
kirsty retreats to the bottom of the stairs
youre not leaving now as he follows julia reaches out and takes hold of his sleeve
kirsty flees the only route she can upstairs
the house is creaking in every board and rafter now
frank turns on julia trapping her against the wall
help me frank
for gods sake
he puts his hands around her neck and leans towards her
at the last moment she seems to understand that he intends not to kiss her but to steal what little life she has left
no frank from the stairs kirsty glimpses him battering upon her
then she looks away and runs up the stairs
when we look back julia is withering in franks arms
the landing is smoky
the lights have taken on a yellowish tinge
the air is full of moans
kirsty is desperate for a hiding place
she tries one of the doors but its locked
she opens another and the din of birds wings gets louder
shot lunging towards kirsty in the doorway
she slams the door in the face of whatevers coming for her
frank hears the door slam
he drops julia to the ground
shes dead her flesh rotting on her face
frank starts to climb the stairs his eyes burning with hunger
kirsty is cornered
from below franks voice
where are you beautiful
kirsty starts up the second flight of stairs as franks shadow is thrown up on the wall below
kirsty is faced with a choice
the torture room door is open but the skinned body is in there so instead she heads for the junk room and opens the door
moonlight falls through the window illuminating a chaos of furniture and boxes
she crosses to the window and tries to get it open
it wont budge
somewhere below where are you honey
she looks around for a lever to open the window with frank reaches the landing and opens the bedroom door calling for her
then he starts up the last flight of stairs
come to daddy
kirsty lifts a cloth off one of the boxes
staring up from the box is the corpse of prudhoe his eyes and mouth open in a silent shriek
she reels back from the box terrified backing into the shadows
an arm reaches for her taking hold of her and dragging her back into darkness as the door opens
frank stands on the theshold
his breath is thick
he shambles forward but he doesnt see her
we cut back to the shadows
kirstys eyes are wild with terror
back to the door which clicks closed
kirsty breaks cover and so does her saviour
he is sweating with terror
a whisper what are you doing here
got in downstairs
looking for you
whats going on
she shakes her head
steve brings the box from his jacket
you forgot something she doesnt see what hes produced
shes already moving to the door
the landing is empty
the door of the junk room opens
kirsty steps out
the house is strangely still
the lights swing a little but otherwise
she advances along the passageway
they reach the top of the stairs in safety
signalled more than spoken ill go first as he speaks frank steps out of the torture room knife in hand
roaring he comes at them both
kirsty flings herself out of the path of the knife
frank swipes at steve who falls backwards down the stairs
he cries out head hitting the stairs as he descends
the box falls from his unconscious hand
frank turns on kirsty who avoids one slice of the knife and another but is driven back into the torture room
hes after her in a flash
she falls beside her fathers body her eyes meeting its skinned face
god dont cry for him
he always was
kirsty has been pushed to the limits of her endurance
she can be terrorized and pursued no longer
death looks an easy option by comparison with more of franks horrors
i dont care
you bastard hush now
its all right
are you losing your mind baby
this is frank youre talking to
as he speaks the bell begins tolling again
frank looks puzzled
whats going on
light begins to pour through the walls of the room
he starts towards the door
but hes too late
the cenobites are standing in his way
he backs off from them
frank to cenobite what took you so long
we had to hear it from his own lips frank turns on kirsty
you set me up
you set me up
the pattern of light in the room has become more elaborate and the cenobites move through it towards frank
to kirsty this isnt for your eyes
kirsty crosses towards the door
as she reaches for the handle she hears frank roar behind her
he breaks between the cenobites knife in hand but as he comes within striking distance the air is full of whining sounds and he stops dead
they have their hooks in him we see
in his arms and legs in his back and sides in his scalp and neck and temples
hooks attached to countless chains which arrest his progress
they plough through his flesh as he strives to reach her
but at a gesture from the leader of the cenobites the chains are hauled in
he flings back his head yelling
the knife drops from his hand
to kirsty out
she turns back to the door and opens it
frank is hauled back towards the centre of the room
the house is growling from basement to eaves now as kirsty steps onto the landing
behind her frank howls
she looks back
they have him in extremis his body spread eagled hooks in a hundred places pulling at his flesh
he fights like a wild animal snarling and cursing
they pull the chains tighter
a close up of franks face
he suddenly stops fighting
he raises his head his eyes staring up at kirsty from beneath a bleeding sweating brow
he flicks his tongue over his bloodied lips
then he comes apart
the door slams as franks body is torn apart in a welter of blood and flesh fragments
something heavy thuds against the door
kirsty turns and starts down the stairs
as she reaches the place where steve is half sitting half lying the house starts to growl as though its foundations are about to give way
steves nose is bleeding and his face is bruised but hes conscious
we have to get out of here
theyll kill us for the fun of it
steve staggers to his feet
kirsty picks up the box which is on the lower landing
as she picks it up the female cenobite steps from the shadows
dont leave us yet kirsty starts to try and manipulate the box in her hands
weve got such sights to show you kirsty manages to slot one of the pieces of the box back into place
her voice becomes a howl and shes sucked away into darkness
behind kirsty jesus christ
they start down to the half landing
there stands the cenobite in the dark glasses carrying the hooked rod he threatened steve with in the hospital
again kirsty manipulates the box
again the cenobite howls and is claimed by the darkness
they hurry down to the hallway half expecting another creature to step into their path
dust is falling from the ceiling and there are cracks opening up in the walls
any moment surely the whole place will be destroyed
julias body has gone from the hallway a trail of blood leads into the dining room
as kirsty and steve stumble across the hallway they hear julias voice off screen an eerie ghostly voice
kirsty hesitates and looks towards the door of the dining room
there stands the bride her white dress soaked in blood her veil covering her face
kirsty takes a step towards her but as she does so the veil rises of its own accord and the chattering cenobite is beneath
kirsty slams the box closed
the cenobite howls and disappears
steve heads for the door
turns the handle
as he does so kirsty realizes theres one piece of the box unfinished
he turns the handle
the door is flung open and the engineer clinging to the sides of the door swings down into the hallway
steve is flung backwards against kirsty
the box falls from kirstys hand
the beast moves to bite at steve who scrambles out of the way leaving kirsty in the front line
the box lies between kirsty and the engineer which now uses its forelegs to crawl over the hallway towards her its legs still bracing it in the door
she snatches for the box
the engineer its mouth oozing fluids almost catches her arm
again she tries
this time one of its arms seizes hold of kirsty and drags her towards its jaws
behind kirsty steve snatches up a piece of plaster and flings it in the engineers face
it momentarily relaxes its grip on kirsty who slides her hand from its hold and claims the box
she now has slime on her fingers
the box defies her manipulations
the engineer crawls towards them
up above the din of the roof collapsing
timbers and dust hurtle down the stairs
the engineer is almost upon her
it rears up its saliva dropping on her
and then miraculously the last piece of the box slots into place
the same vortex that seized the other cenobite seizes the engineer
howling its complaint it is drawn out into the darkness beyond the door and disappears
its voice grows thin and fades
the house is still
kirsty gets to her feet
steve does the same
together they move to the door and out onto the step
the door slams behind them of its own accord
kirsty turns the sealed box over in her hand
there is a slit in it which has not quite closed
light suddenly pours from it up into kirstys face
her features are momentarily distorted as if sucked towards the box
from within shrieks bells music
between the screams franks voice
come to daddy
she slams the panel shut
the distortions cease
so does the din
quietly not tonight
a smile crosses her face and she leaves the doorstep making her way towards the street
steve gazes at her then follows
their figures are erased by the darkness
somewhere a bell rings as
