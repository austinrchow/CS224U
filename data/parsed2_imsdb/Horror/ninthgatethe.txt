the ninth gate dean corso
a roman polanski film written by
enrique urbiz roman polanski and john brownjohn telfer house library
andrew telfer a scrawny seventy year old is writing a note at his desk in one corner of a big book lined room
dangling from the central chandelier is a noose
a chair stands beneath it
telfer looks up for a moment
blankly he eyes a framed photoportrait on his desk a beautiful thirty something blonde returns his gaze with an enigmatic smile
he stops writing and folds the sheet scrawls something on the back and leaves it on the desk
then he walks to the centre of the room and climbs on the chair
he puts his head through the noose and tightens it around his neck
he kicks away the back of the chair but it doesnt fall
frantically he tries again this time the chair topples over
the chandelier squeaks as it swings on its hook but it holds
fragments of plaster come raining down
his neck isnt broken he starts to choke
his feet perform a convulsive dance in mid air only six inches above the floor one of his shoes comes off
the camera leaves the dying man and moves in on the bookshelves
to the accompaniment of choking sounds it pans across the rows of volumes until it reaches a gap that shows where one of them has been removed
the choking sounds cease
the camera enters the black void left by the missing book
the screen goes dark
manhattan skyline seen through a picture window
above it reflected in the windowpane the face of an old woman seated with her back to the room
her expression is impassive and self absorbed her twisted mouth suggests shes a stroke victim
she seems quite uninvolved in the action behind her
corso off screen an impressive collection
you have some very rare editions here
sure you want to sell them all
dean corso a tall lean rather unkempt man in his s
steel rimmed glasses crumpled old tweed jacket worn cords scuffed brown oxfords
he replaces a book on a shelf
standing beside him is the old womans son a middle aged man with a puffy red face
her daughter in law looks on one hand cupping her elbow the fingers of the other playing avidly with her lower lip
the son is cuddling a large scotch on the rocks like its an integral part of his anatomy
son theyre no use to father not anymore not now hes passed away
his library was his own little world
now its just a painful memory for mother here
daughter in law unbearably painful
corso glances at them over the top of his glasses then at the old woman
its clear that the old womans true source of pain is their desire to convert her late husbands library into hard cash
he picks up a notebook adjusts his glasses with an instinctive habitual movement taps the notebook with his pencil corso well at a rough preliminary estimate you have a collection
here worth around two hundred thousand dollars
daughter in law almost jumps two hundred thousand
corso or thereabouts
he smiles sweetly at the daughter in law
the old woman continues to stare blankly at her reflection in the window
behind her the son sidles up to corso who indicates the volumes in question
son how much were you thinking of
i couldnt go higher than four grand four and a half tops
takes an envelope from his shoulder bag and starts peeling off some bills manhattan apartment
corso walks along the corridor toward the elevator with the canvas bag slung from his shoulder
hes grinning to himself
the bag is obviously heavier than it was
the elevator doors open just as hes about to press the button
he almost collides with a bespectacled briefcase carrying man in a three piece suit and bow tie witkin
witkin caustically you here
you didnt waste much time
corso hello witkin
theres a small fortune in there
smiles sardonically help yourself
witking eyes corsos beg suspiciously youre a vulture corso
corso who isnt in our business
witkin youd stoop to anything
corso brushes past him into the elevator turns and pats his shoulder bag for a quixote by ybarra
you bet i would
witkin indignantly unscrupulous thoroughly unscrupulous
corso thumbs the elevator button good hunting
the elevator doors close on witkins face
bernies book store
a sign says closed
corso pushes open the door of an old fashioned semibasement bookstore bernies rare books and enters
he walks up to the counter and deposits his bag on it
bernie off screen witkin just called me
hes spitting blood
corso looks around
the voice came from ten feet up and three bookcases along
bernie feldman a man around corsos age with dark curly hair receding at the temples is perched at the top of a spiral staircase whats his problem
bernie replacing some books he says youre a double dealing money grubbing bastard
he says he had that sale tied up and now youve queered his pitch
corso grins to himself he should be quicker off the mark
bernie starts to descend
corso goes over to a wall cupboard and opens it
an assortment of bottles and glasses come to light
bernie your valuation was way over the odds its brought those people out in a rash
theyre now asking twice what the books are worth
corso still grinning pours himself a slug of scotch
bernie reaches the ground hes talking about suing you
well lets face it you screwed him
thats what its called
corso i know what its called
bernie comes up close he also says you snaffled the don qui
he stops when corso shows him the four volumes of the quixote
he bends over to examine them whistles appreciatively the ybarra don quixote four volumes
opens one sonofabitch youre the best in the business
corso and the most expensive
smiles slyly that client of yours the swiss is he still interested in this edition
bernie smiles back then redirects his attention to the books sure but witkin will blow a fuse
i told him i had nothing to do with this operation
corso knocks back his scotch in one gulp
takes out a crumpled cigarette from the pocket of his overcoat he sticks it in his mouth and lights it nothing except your ten percent
the swiss is my client remember
corso shakes his head no deal
cynically for my childrens sake
corso you dont have any
bernie im still young
give me time
corso eblows out a stream of smoke unmoved ten
a taxi pulls up outside an opulent building downtown
corso gets out dodges a persistent beggar and enters
the sign above the entrance reads balkan publications
inside he nods to the security guard at the desk and makes his way across the lobby to a door at the back
beside it stands an easel mounted announcement demons and medieval literature by boris balkan ph
its adorned with a medieval engraving of an inquisition torture scene
enter lecture room
boris balkan standing at a state of the art lecturers desk is a bulky imposing figure of a man around years old
his thick gray hair is slicked back to reveal a domed forehead
wearing a pair of heavy hornrimmed glasses he speaks in a deep slow almost monotonous voice but with great authority
balkan relevant information may be found in antoine martin del rios disquisitionum magicarum louvain and earlier in in de la dmonomanle des sorciers by the frenchman jean bodin
his eyes flicker in the direction of the door as corso enters
his entrance has also been noted by a girl in jeans and white sneakers childlike face short hair and green feline eyes
he sits down in the same row but on the other side of the aisle settles himself in his chair and scans the audience most of whom are middle aged
he gives the girl a cursory glance then concentrates on balkan
balkan bodin was probably the first to attempt to establish a system if the term system may be applied to the middle ages for classifying the contemporary perceptions of evil
in bodin we find one of the first definitions of the word witch
i quote cocks his head for a better look at the text a witch is a person who though cognizant of the laws of god endeavors to act through the
medium of a pact with the devil
as balkan continues the lecture corsos eyelids begin to droop
we pan over the faces of the audience the girl is still observing corso
balkans voice drones on fades away
corsos fast asleep
balkan off screen i see you enjoyed my little talk mr
corso gives a start and opens his eyes
he takes a moment or two to focus on balkan whos standing over him
peering around he sees that the lecture is over
the last of the audience are filing out
we glimpse the girl making her exit
did i snore
balkan nice of you to ask
no not that i noticed
shall we go
he gestures at the door with a cold and impassive air
corso gets to his feet
balkan walks swiftly across the lobby to the elevators with corso at his heels
they leave behind a buzz of conversation from members of the audience who are still discussing the lecture
dont you sleep nights
corso like a baby
balkan strange id have bet a brace of gutenberg bibles you spend half the night with your eyes peeled
youre one of those lean hungry restless types that put the wind up julius caesar men whod stab their friends in the back
they reach the elevator
balkan presses a button and turns to corso who yawns
not i suspect that you have many friends do you mr
your kind seldom does
corso calmly go to hell
balkan is unruffled by corsos words
the elevator doors open
he stands aside to let corso pass then follows him in
he punches a code number on the elevators digital keyboard
the elevator starts to ascend
youre right of course
your friendships dont concern me in the least
our relations have always been strictly commercial isnt that so
theres no one more reliable than a man whose loyalty can be bought for hard cash
corse hey balkan i came here to do some business not shoot the breeze
you want to expound your personal philosophy write another book
balkan you dont like me do you
corso shrugs i dont have to like you
youre a client and you pay well
the elevator doors open into a spacious room faced with black marble
the walls are bare save for a big back lighted photograph of a ruined castle overlooking a desolate valley
two huge windows in the right hand wall extend from floor to ceiling
visible outside on the buildings floodlit facade gargoyles gaze out over the city with their monstrous heads propped on their claws
the centre of the room is occupied by a rectangular block of tinted glass resembling a big black monolith
vaguely discernible through the glass are shelves filled with antique books in exquisite bindings
balkan leads corso over to the monolith
he gestures at it proudly soliciting admiration
balkan youre privileged corso
very few people have ever set foot in here
this is my private collection
some bibliophiles specialize in gothic novels others in books of hours
all my own rare editions have the same protagonist the devil
corso impressed but does his best not to show it may i take a look
balkan thats why i brought you here
balkan goes over to the monolith and punches a keyboard on a control panel gestures to corso to come closer
corso puts out his hand
before he can touch the glass it glides aside with a faint hum
he fixes his glasses and glances at balkan who looks on calmly
his eyes roam along the spines of the books
balkan comes and stands beside him
beautiful arent they
that soft sheen that superb gilding
not to mention the centuries of wisdom they contain centuries of erudition of delving into the secrets of the universe and the hearts of men
i know people who would kill for a collection like this
corso shoots him a quick glance the ars diavoli
youll never see as many books on the subject anywhere else in the world
theyre the rarest the choicest editions in existence
it has taken me a lifetime to assemble them
only the supreme masterpiece was missing
he accompanies corso on his tour of the collection
they come to the end of the monolith
gesturing to corso to follow him balkan goes over to an ultramodern brushed steel lectern standing beside one of the huge picture windows
as he approaches the lectern corso briefly glimpses the sheer drop beyond the window the twinkling lights of traffic passing in the street far below
reposing on the lectern is a black book adorned with a gold pentagram
corso opens it at the title page which displays the title in latin and a pictorial engraving
corso not looking at balkan the nine gates of the kingdom of shadows
balkan youre familiar with it
the author and printer was aristide torchia burned by the holy inquisition together with all his works
only three copies survived
corso the catalogs list three copies surviving in private ownership the fargas the kessler and the telfer
youve done your homework but youre wrong nonetheless
according to all the sources i myself have consulted only one is authentic
the author confessed under torture that hed hidden one copy
corso well three are known
balkan thats the trouble
corso resumes his inspection of the book where did you get it
balkan i bought it from telfer
corso surprised telfer
balkan looking out the window yes he finally sold it to me
the day before he killed himself
corso good timing
balkan ignores this
corso turns the pages with care
he lingers over an engraving of a knight in armor riding toward a castle with a finger to his lips as though enjoining the reader to silence
below it is a caption
balkan draws closer and reads over corsos shoulder nemo pervenit qui non legitime certaverit
corso you only succeed if you fight by the rules
balkan more or less
ever heard of the delomelanicon
corso heard of it yes
a myth isnt it
some horrific book reputed to have been written by satan himself
balkan no myth
that book existed
torchia actually acquired it
he returns to the window overlooking the sheer drop
gazing down he goes on the engravings youre now admiring were adapted by torchia from the delomelanicon
theyre a form of satanic riddle
correctly interpreted with the aid of the original text and sufficient inside information theyre reputed to conjure up the prince of darkness in person
corso you dont say
he continues to turn the pages balkan are you a religious man corso
i mean do you believe in the supernatural
corso i believe in my percentage
i also believe that books grow old and decay like the rest of us
dont you get dizzy standing there
balkan continues to stare down at the city what the hell do you want from me balkan
balkan leaves the window and confronts him i want you to go to europe and play the detective
the other two copies are in portugal and france
you must find some way of comparing them with mine every page every engraving the binding everything
im convinced that only one can be authentic and i want to know which one it is
corso could be an expensive trip
balkan takes a folded check from his pocket and hands it to corso who slips it into his breast pocket unexamined thats to get you started
spend what you need
corso what if i find your copys a forgery
balkan stares at him coldly its quite on the cards
corso seeming mildly surprised
he looks at the book again listens to the quality of the paper by putting his ear to the pages and riffling them with his thumb really
it doesnt appear to be
even the paper sounds kosher
balkan even so
there may be something wrong with it
corso continues to examine the book
he smiles you mean the devil wont show up
shuts the book and replaces it on the lectern balkan dont be flippant
quotes there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy
corso hamlet believed in ghosts not demons
balkan if all three copies turn out to be bogus or incomplete your work will be done
if one of them proves to be genuine on the other hand ill finance you further
corso stares at him then unfolds the check and glances at the amount a substantial sum from the way he raises his eyebrows i shall want you to get it
for me at all costs never mind how
corso never mind how sounds illegal
balkan it wouldnt be the first time youve done something illegal
corso not that illegal
balkan hence the size of the check
do a good job and ill double it
he picks up the nine gates and holds it out
after a moments hesitation corso replaces the check in his pocket and takes the book be careful corso
corso what do you mean
indicates the book with this
balkan just be careful
a small kitchen
corso one hand wrapped around a scotch uses the other to remove a tv dinner from the freezer compartment of his refrigerator and insert it in a microwave
he shuts the door sets the timer and strolls out into the living room
a plain apartment
no pictures ornaments or photographs just books on every available shelf and surface
against one wall a desk with a computer on it
on the floor beside the desk corsos shabby canvas bag
on the desk itself the nine gates
corso goes over to the desk
he stares down at the book for a long moment meditatively sipping his scotch
then without putting his glass down he opens the book one handed and idly turns a few pages pauses at the engraving of the knight in armor riding toward the
the camera moves in slowly until the screen is filled with the image of the knight with his finger enigmatically raised to his lips
corso canvas bag on shoulder is standing in the middle of a sitting room
the decor which includes a smiling portrait of andrew telfer is very rich
hes looking up at the portrait when the door opens
he turns to see liana telfer on the threshold with a business card in her hand
his appreciation of her looks is evident
liana is a very sexy thirtyish blonde
she gives corso the once over then enters closing the door behind her
gestures at the business card dean corso
sorry to trouble you at a time like this
liana comes over and sits down on a sofa motioning corso into the armchair that faces it over a coffee table
she puts his card down crosses her legs and waits
corso sits down with his bag between his feet
opening it he produces the nine gates
liana stiffens at the sight of it
corso it would be very helpful maam if you could tell me what you know about this book
he holds it out
after a momentary pause liana slowly reaches for the book opens it at random turns a page or two
she speaks with a slight french accent
liana casually isnt this one of my husbands books
it was in his collection until very recently
he sold it to a client of mine
im trying to authenticate it
liana he sold it you say
it was one of his most treasured possessions
corso he never mentioned the sale
liana late in answering
corso spots her hesitation no
its news to me
who bought it
corso a private collector
liana may i know his name
corso im afraid thats confidential
liana i suppose he has a bill of sale
corso no problem there
liana is this your job authenticating rare books
corso and tracking them down
liana smiles youre a book detective
corso smiles back kind of
pause do you recall when and where your husband acquired this book
liana in spain
we were vacationing at toledo
andrew got very excited paid a great deal of money for it
he was a fanatical collector
corso so i gather
liana puts the book on the coffee table and rises ill show you
then a thought strikes him picking up the book and his bag he follows her to a door at the far end of the room which she opens
she walks on ahead into the library in which andrew telfer hanged himself
corso is eyeing her from behind
he drags his eyes away from lianas figure and surveys the crowded shelves really magnificent
he goes over to inspect the bookshelves
in passing he glances up at the chandelier which is still hanging slightly askew
liana andrew used to spend many hours in here
corso did he ever try it out
he asks the question with an air of spurious innocence looking around the room as he does so
liana i dont understand
corso the book did he ever use it to perform some kind of ritual intended to
produce a supernatural effect
liana are you serious
liana a black mass you mean
corso more or less
an attempt to conjure up the devil
liana andrew was a trifle eccentric mr
corso but he wasnt insane
its true hed been acting strangely those last few days
he shut himself up in here seldom emerged except for meals
she draws a deep breath glances at the chandelier that morning i was woken by the screams of the maid hed hanged himself
pauses looks at him whatever he was up to i certainly cant see him chanting mumbo jumbo or trying to raise the dead
the flippant tone of the last few words sounds rather forced
corso smiles at her faintly over his glasses pats his shoulder bag
corso the devil mrs
this book is designed to raise the devil
corso exits the telfer house and crosses the forecourt to the street
a man with a mustache and a scarred face is leaning against a limo parked outside the house smoking a small cigar
they eye each other briefly
corso reaches the sidewalk just as a cab sails past
he raises his hand too late to flag it down looks around for another
the mustached mans cellphone beeps
he reaches into the limo and picks up the receiver
reference library day
numerous readers are occupying the rows of tables in the central area
corso is seated at one of the tables with the nine gates in front of him
beside it reposes a large catalog and his notebook
the nine gates is open at the frontispiece which displays the title de umbrarum regni novem portis and the words sic luceat lux separated by an emblem consisting of a
tree encircled by a snake devouring its own tail
as we move in on the coiled snake we hear corso translating to himself in a low voice corso off screen sic luceat lux
thus let the light shine
the day goes on
many of the tables are now deserted and corso shuts a catalog and gets up to replace it in the wall of books behind him
he runs his finger along a shelf till he comes to another fat tome and removes it
hes startled to see framed in the gap where the book just was the face of the girl at balkans lecture short hair green feline eyes
the face recedes and disappears
corso quickly rounds the end of the bookshelf no sign of her
he looks both ways but the aisles are deserted
puzzled he resumes his seat and opens the second catalog
then sensing that hes being watched he swings around
nothing outwardly suspicious just two students comparing notes whispering
he scans the reading room at large still nothing
he turns some pages in the nine gates comes to an engraving of a naked woman riding a seven headed dragon with a castle ablaze in the background
he consults the second catalog which displays a small reproduction of the same scene with text wrapped around it and jots something down in his notebook
tired he straightens and stretches removes his glasses pinches the bridge of his nose
as he scans the room his vision gives him an unfocused glimpse of the girl looking down at him from the gallery overhead
by the time he replaces his glasses shes gone
its raining hard
he trudges up the steps of his brownstone with the canvas bag on his shoulder and a bag of groceries in his arms
he rides the elevator up and walks down the passage to his door
he puts his key in the lock and tries to turn it but finds that its unlocked already
he tries the second lock and turns it
this is unlocked as well so the door opens at once
it takes him a moment to digest this but then he hears a muffled crash from inside the apartment and a window has been flung open in a hurry
he bursts into the living room
no one there but the light is on
dropping his shoulder bag and groceries he dashes into the bedroom
the window is open and the curtains are billowing out into the room
he darts to the window flings one leg over the sill and climbs out on the fire escape
feet can be heard clattering down the fire escape
he peers over the rail just in time to see a dark figure head into the side street beneath him and sprint off through the rain
corso yells half heartedly hey you
he gives up and climbs back inside and scans the living room
the only immediate sign of the intruders presence is that the chair has been pulled away from the desk and one of the drawers is open
he pushes the chair back into place and shuts the drawer
bernies book store
the nine gates is lying open on bernies desk
hes reverently turning the pages with corso at his elbow
bernie son of a bitch
where did you get this
he wants me to research it
bernie balkan owns a nine gates
corso recently acquired from the late lamented andrew telfer
bernie trust balkan
what does he need you for
i dont suppose he plans to sell it
corso he wants me to compare it with the other two surviving copies in portugal and france
im off to europe
bernie compare it
only one of the three is authentic he says
bernie well this one looks genuine enough
must be worth a million
take good care of it
corso thats why im here
i need you to stash it for me
im starting to see things
bernie stares at him like what
corso uninvited visitors unfamiliar faces
i dont trust anyone not even balkan
reflects for a moment come to think of it i dont even trust you
bernie a mixture of affection and cynicism thats mean buddy
you know id never screw you without a damn good reason money women business
anything else you can relax
corso taps the book with his forefinger youll answer for this with your balls bernie
bernie still engrossed sure man sure
you can castrate me personally
corso ill pick it up on my way to the airport
bernie no problem
he continues to pore over the book turns another page reads aloud virtue lies vanquished huh
these engravings are terrific
corso leans over his shoulder or horrific whichever
bernie nods absently
he smiles to himself with an air of enchantment beautiful just beautiful
visible through the bookstores semi basement windows the legs of passerby accelerate as they scurry past it has started to rain
a pair of mans legs in dark slacks come to a halt
the butt of a small cigar falls to the sidewalk the legs walk on
two white sneakers come into view
they step on the butt and extinguish it
in the bedroom corso packs some articles of clothing and toiletries in a small suitcase lying open on the bed
the doorbell rings
somewhat startled corso straightens up dumps a handful of socks on the bed and goes out into the lobby
he peers through the spyhole liana telfer is standing outside
he pauses for a moment thinking hard then opens the door
liana may i come in
corso steps aside and lets her in this way
he shows her into the living room
she starts to unbutton her coat allow me
he helps her off with her coat and drapes it neatly over a chair
shes dressed to kill in a black lowcut cocktail gown
liana thank you
corso sit down wont you
liana sits gracefully on the sofa taking in the decor of his bachelor apartment as she does so ive come to talk business
everyones talking business to me lately
liana takes a slim gold cigarette case from her purse and lights it yesterday when you came to see me about that book i was too surprised to react as
i should have done
i mean it really was one of andrews favorites
corso so you said
liana id like to get it back
corso that could be a problem
liana not necessarily
it all depends
corso on what
liana on you
corso stares at her absorbing the lines of her figure i dont understand mrs
the book isnt mine to dispose of
liana she sits back showing off her legs you work for money i take it
corso what else
liana i have a great deal of money
corso im happy for you
liana you could stage a theft
im sure your client is well insured
corso im a professional maam
liana youre a professional mercenary
mercenaries work for the highest bidder
corso i make a living
liana huskily i could throw in a bonus
corso this has happened before someplace
liana i know
in the movies
corso and she had an automatic in her stocking top
corso watches mesmerized as she slowly very slowly slides her skirt up her thighs to reveal her stocking tops and black lace garter belt
liana no automatic
just as slowly she smooths her skirt down over her thighs
corso swallows hard
he rises and goes to his drinks corner a shelf with an array of bottles and glasses on it
over his shoulder corso want one
liana why not
corso splashes some scotch into two tumblers and carries them over to her
liana sits motionless for an instant looking up at him
then very slowly she stubs out her cigarette extends the same hand and fondles his crotch
corso with the tumblers encumbering both his hands can only stand there like a bird hypnotized by a snake
his adams apple bobs some more
holding his gaze liana withdraws her hand and rises
theyre only inches apart now
she takes one of the tumblers and clinks it against corsos then drains it
he does the same while in a kind of trance
very deliberately liana relieves him of his glass and puts it down on the table with hers
then cupping his face between her hands she proceeds to kiss him
he pulls up her skirt she reaches for his zipper and yanks at it
he bears her backward and downward onto the sofa
the gown slips down over lianas left shoulder revealing a small tattoo in the shape of a snake devouring its own tail
lianas hand reaches across the floor for corsos canvas bag
she searches in the bag then inverts it spilling the contents a couple of packs of luckies a notebook an envelope full of bills a swiss army knife an experts
magnifying glass some pencils etc
corso and liana on the floor their clothing dishevelled
corso is lying back still panting and sweating from his exertions liana is sitting up
liana well where is it
corso wheres what
liana dont fuck with me corso
corso i thought thats what we were doing
lianas eyes narrow
she goes for his face with her nails and teeth
corso turns his head away just in time and scrambles to his feet pulling up his trousers
liana beside herself with fury flies at him with both hands extended like claws
he manages to grab her wrists and immobilize them so she sinks her teeth in his chest
with an agonized yell corso releases her wrists clasps his chest and staggers back hes hobbled by the trousers that have slumped around his ankles
liana looks around wildly for a weapon of some kind catches sight of the scotch bottle and seizes it by the neck
corso one hand holding his trousers at half mast the other raised in supplication comes shuffling toward her
corso hey look be reasonable
unmoved liana raises the bottle and smashes it over his head
corso recovers consciousness gingerly feels his aching head
some blood has trickled down his face
he surveys the room which is in chaos and has obviously been ransacked
he goes into the bathroom and inspects himself in the mirror takes a hand towel and gingerly dabs his scalp
holding the towel to his head he returns to the living room where he picks up the phone and punches out a number
we hear a recorded announcement bernie voice over hi this is bernies rare books
im not available right now
if you want to leave a message please speak after the beep
corso into phone bernie you there
he hangs up
bernies book store
corso bag on shoulder is lurking in a doorway across the street from the bookstore
the place looks silent and deserted but a dim glow indicates that a light must be on somewhere inside
corso quits the doorway and hurries across the street
he walks down the steps to the door and tries the handle
the door opens
only bernies desk light is on
no sign of bernle himself
he listens intently looks up at the top of the spiral staircase which is in shadow calls in a low voice corso bernie
he listens some more nothing but the sound of a passing car
he makes his way cautiously along the bookcases and rounds a corner then stops short with a look of horror on his face
bernie has been lashed upside down to the handrail of the spiral staircase
his mouth and eyes are open and his battered face is streaked with blood
corso jesus christ
he puts out a hand toward bernie but the man is so obviously dead that he withdraws it
he looks around in an involuntary apprehensive way
then satisfied that hes alone he starts to climb the staircase
once past bernies corpse which he studiously avoids touching he climbs faster
the staircase creaks and sways
reaching the third tier of bookshelves he presses a hidden button
with a faint click a panel springs open to disclose a recess filled with books
corso expels a deep breath
there it is safe and sound the nine gates
he looks down at bernie
corso thanks man
corso ensconced in a window seat is moodily gazing out at some passing cloud castles
the sun is setting
wearing his overcoat and carrying his suitcase threads his way through them with the canvas bag on his shoulder
weary and unshaven he stares straight ahead with an abstracted expression adjusts his glasses
his footsteps echo as he walks bag on shoulder along one of toledos narrow medieval streets
very few people to be seen
the sun is shining brightly but theres a strong wind blowing
rounding a corner he heads down an alleyway flanked by scaffolding swathed in protective netting and blue tarpaulins
its completely deserted
no sound but that of canvas billowing in the wind like a ships sails
he consults a street sign turns another corner
he reaches a doorway leading to an inner courtyard bumps into a boy who comes running out
we hear the strident cries of a woman
a flight of steps in one corner of the courtyard leads down to the basement
corso descends them and stops outside a door
a grimy window beside it serves to display some old books and religious prints
the sign on the door reads hermanos ceniza restauracion de libros
below it on parle francais and english spoken
he opens the door which creaks and enters
a gaunt bent backed old man pedro ceniza with a pair of glasses perched on the end of his big nose looks up from an old hand press
everything about him is as gray as the cigarette ash that rains down on his clothes and the books hes working on
hes a chain smoker
corso buenas tardes
pedro buenes tardes
pablo off screen buenas tardes
corso turns to see another old man pablo ceniza surface from behind some stacks of paper
his resemblance to pedro is such that they can only be twins
pablo wipes his inky hand on a rag before shaking corsos
pedro follows suit
corso hesitates briefly as pedro and pablo look him up and down
their movements are slow and serene their expression carries a hint of mockery and they often exchange knowing smiles
corso you speak english
they nod simultaneously
he produces the nine gates from his shoulder bag id appreciate your opinion on this
pedro takes the book with tremulous hands
pablo quickly clears away some parchments on the workbench to make room for it
some ash from pedros cigarette falls on the cover
pablo clicks his tongue and blows it off
pablo reprovingly what a habit for a bookbinder
smiles at corso the nine gates
a superb edition
pedro opens it the telfer copy
corso you used to own it right
pedro we used to yes
pablo we sold it
pedro we sold it when the opportunity presented itself
it was too
pablo too good to miss
an excellent sale
pedro an excellent buy impeccable condition
you are the present owner
corso a client of mine
pablo over his glasses i would never have believed she would part with it
pablo without looking up senora telfer
corso reaches into his overcoat pocket and extracts a crumpled cigarette
hes raising it to his lips when he stops short produces the equally crumpled pack and offers it to pedro who has just discarded his butt
pedro helps himself to a lucky breaks off the filter and jams it in his mouth
corso lights both of them
corso i understood it was mr
telfer that bought it
pablo he paid for it
pedro it was the senora who made him buy it
he did not seem particularly
glances at pablo pablo
pedro finished examining the text
he looks at the spine a superb specimen
corso hesitates briefly could it be a forgery
pedro suspiciously almost indignantly a forgery
turns to pablo you heard that pablo
pablo wags his finger reprovingly in corsos face i took you for a professional senor
you speak too lightly of forgeries
pedro far too lightly
pablo forging a book is expensive
paper of the period the right inks
makes a dismissive gesture too expensive to be profitable
pedro and pablo assess the effect of their words on corso who digests them
corso im aware of all that but could some part of it be forged
restorers have been known to replace missing pages with pages taken from another copy of the same edition
have you never done that yourselves
the old men look at each other then turn to corso simultaneously
pedro looking flattered nods
pedro of course it can be done
pablo it requires great skill naturally but yes it can be done
corso couldnt that be the case here
pablo what makes you ask
corso my client wishes to satisfy himself of the books authenticity
the brothers eye each other over their glasses
corso adjusts his own his name is balkan
boris balkan of new york
pablo and pedro exchange another glance
corso detects the hint of a smile that passes between them
pedro all books have a destiny of their own
pablo even a life of their own
senor balkan is a noted bibliophile
hes no fool
he must know this book is authentic
pedro we know it
pablo so must he
pedro this book was with us for years
pablo many years
pedro we had ample opportunity to examine it thoroughly
the printing and binding are superb examples of th century venetian craftsmanship
he picks up the book and riffles the pages under corsos nose finest rag paper resistant to the passage of time
none of your modern wood pulp
pablo watermarks identical shades ink type faces
if this is a forgery or a copy with pages restored its the work of a master
pedro a master
corso contemplates the brothers with a smile did you study the engravings
they seem to form a kind of riddle
pedro and pablo reopen the book and look at the engravings
pablo well yes
another glance at pedro books of this type often contain little puzzles
pedro especially in the case of such an illustrious collaborator
corso looks at pedro with sudden interest then at the book then back at pedro
pedro shrugs pablo refocuses on corso you cannot have proceeded very far with your research
come look closely
he takes a magnifying glass and holds it over one of the engravings which shows a hermit with two keys in his hand and dog and a lantern beside him
a microscopic inscription can be detected in the bottom right corner
corso bends over it looking mystified
pedro grows impatient
pedro dont you see
only seven of the engravings were signed by aristide torchia
corso and the other two
pedro this is one of them
corso peers through the magnifying glass once more
we see the insert invenit l
pedro he and pablo chuckle heartily youre a clever man senor
torchia was not alone when they burned him alive
corso but thats absurd
you dont honestly believe
pedro the man who wrote this did so in alliance with the devil and went to the stake for it
even hell has its heroes senor
corso looks from one to the other trying to figure this out
corso walks back along the narrow alleyway with the canvas covered scaffolding
he glances over his shoulder
not a soul in sight
the blue canvas flaps in the wind the scaffolding creaks and groans
he walks on
he hears a sudden rending sound looks back and up
theres little time to react the scaffolding has come away from its mountings
its starting to buckle and fall out into the street
he breaks into a run
behind him collapsing like a house of cards the mass of canvas and metal gains on him as he sprints for the end of the alley summoning up all his
energy for a final burst
the last of the scaffolding hits the ground only inches behind him
he looks back at the tangled mass that has only just failed to engulf him
the dining car is deserted save for corso and a steward who is lolling against the kitchen bulkhead at the far end
corso with a coffee cup and a brandy glass at his elbow has the nine gates lying open in front of him at the engraving of the hermit with the
keys dog and lantern
theres some cigarette ash trapped between the pages
smiling faintly he blows it away
then he reaches into his bag for his magnifying glass pushes up his steel rimmed specs and screws the glass into his eye
he examines the engraving at close range
we see again the insert of the inscription invenit l
he straightens up and removes the glass from his eye
he finishes his brandy and beckons the steward
corso with bag on shoulder crosses the sliding floorplates that connect one car to another
he enters the next corridor and stops short theres a lone figure leaning against a window looking out its the girl we saw at balkans lecture short dark hair catlike
green eyes slim athletic figure jeans and white sneakers
corso sets off along the corridor
when he reaches her they eye each others reflections in the windowpane
girl softly hi
corso pauses to look at her unable to make up his mind ive seen you before havent i
girl have you
corso yes somewhere
a brief silence
girl are you traveling in this car
corso the next one
girl the sleeper
smiles i travel on the cheap
corso are you a student
girl something like that
looks out the window again i like trains
corso me too
whats your name
corso shrugs smiles greeneyes
girl thatll do
girl strange name
it means i run
girl you dont look like a runner to me more the quiet type
they look at each others reflections once more
corso well have a good trip
girl and you
corso walks on down the corridor
theres something weird about this chance encounter but he cant figure out what
girl see you around maybe
corso pauses and looks back
he nods maybe
corso with bag on shoulder gets off the train
a horse drawn carriage drops him off in front of a massive gateway flanked by stone walls thick with ivy
corso pushes open the gate and beyond them is a neglected drive
dead leaves litter a gravel driveway flanked by crumbling statues some of which have toppled over onto the long neglected weed infested lawn
his muffled footsteps are the only sound
near the house is a dried up dilapidated fountain faced with tiles and topped by a mouldering cherub
the waters of the ornamental pond beside it are dark and coated with dead leaves and water lilies
the quinta fargas is a gloomy four square th century mansion
corso walks up the steps and tugs the old fashioned bellpull
he waits glances at his watch
echoing footsteps approach
a sound of bolts being withdrawn and the door opens to reveal victor fargas
tall and bone thin he has a drooping white mustache
his baggy trousers and oversized woolen sweater contrast with a pair of old but immaculately polished shoes
corso dean corso mr
puts out his hand how do you do
fargas hesitates before shaking hands
corso ah yes
please come in
fargas who has a slight limp leads the way through two reception rooms entirely bare and empty
corso observes the patches on the walls that indicate the former location of paintings curtains pieces of furniture etc
fargas home sweet home
he ushers corso into a large but sparsely furnished drawing room
you wont say no to a brandy i take it
he goes over to a side table and pours some cognac into two fine crystal glasses
corso meantime is surveying the room
at the far end is a huge open fireplace
two armchairs a table a sideboard some candlesticks a violin case and books
theyre neatly stacked on the floor and the few pieces of furniture
corso has just discovered them when fargas comes over with the glasses
he puts his bag down and takes one
admiringly handsome glasses
fargas these are the only ones i have left
corso looks around the room must have been a beautiful place
fargas it was but old families are like ancient civilizations they wither and die
he raises his glass in a silent toast
corso does the same
fargas gestures towards the books there they are eight hundred and thirty four of them
a pity you didnt see them in better times in their bookcases
i used to have five thousand
these are the survivors
corso runs his fingers caressingly over a book so this is the fargas collection
not quite as i imagined it
fargas cest la vie my friend
but i keep them in perfect condition safe from damp light heat and rats
i dust and air them every day
its all i do do in fact
corso what happened to the rest
fargas sacrificed in a good cause
i had to sell them to preserve the others
five or six books a year
almost all the proceeds go to the state in taxes
corso why dont you sell up
fargas sell the fargas family estate
its obvious youre an american my friend
there are things you cant be expected to understand
corso continues to survey the books fascinated if you sold all these your financial problems would be over
picks up a book and examines it look at this poliphilo for example a real gem
fargas corso replaces the book
fargas leans over and carefully adjusts the book until its precisely in its original position i know but if i sold them all id have no reason to go on
he heads for the bottle on the side table without waiting for a reply
corso what about the nine gates
fargas puzzled what about it
corso thats why im here
i told you on the phone
fargas the phone
pause yes of course i remember now
of course the nine gates
he looks around several times as if trying to collect his thoughts drains his cognac and limps over to some books on a rug near the fireplace
they both kneel on the rug side by side
corso examines the books which all deal with magic alchemy and demonology well what do you think
corso not bad
fargas not bad indeed
these i will never sell
at least ten of them are exceedingly rare
look plancys dictionary of hell first edition leonardo fioravantis compendi di secreti of
but this is what interests you no
he picks up a black book with a gold pentacle on the cover the second copy of the nine gates and holds it out
corso takes it carefully and gets to his feet
fargas rises too there it is in perfect condition
it has traveled the world for three and a half centuries yet it might have been printed yesterday
corso takes the book over to a window
fargas follows is it in order
you havent detected anything unusual
the text is complete the engravings too
nine plus the title page just as the catalogs state just like the kessler in paris and the telfer in new york
corso it isnt the telfer anymore
telfer killed himself but he sold his copy to balkan first
if he sets his heart on a book no price is too high
its strange he should have sent you here if he already
breaks off as something has just occurred to him
he points to corsos bag you have it with you
may i see it
corso gets the book and they go over to a table
fargas places the two copies side by side bends over them superb beautiful identical
two of the only three that escaped the flames reunited for the first time in over three centuries
he turns the pages of each book caressing the yellowing paper with his fingertips look at this imperfection
in the fourth line here the damaged s
the same type the same impression
turns both copies of the nine gates over to reveal their backboards
if it werent for this slight discoloration on the back of my copy one couldnt tell them apart
corso if its all right with you id like to stay awhile and study them in detail
fargas eyes him keenly what are you looking for mr
corso i wish i knew
fargas looks suddenly grave some books are dangerous
not to be opened with impunity
corso very true
a fire burns on the hearth
fargas is seated at a window practicing the violin
he repeats the same short piece over and over again occasionally pausing to take a sip of brandy
corso is sitting at a table with both copies of the nine gates open in front of him at the engraving of the knight with a finger to his lips
he compares the two copies with the aid of his magnifying glass
they look identical
he turns over several pages in each book until he comes to the hermit with the keys dog and lanter
he compares the two copies
again no apparent difference
he proceeds to a third engraving a wayfarer approaching a bridge with two gate towers and an angelic archer in the clouds overhead
another seemingly identical pair
then he stops short and returns to the second engraving
it looks the same but then he spots it in balkans copy the keys are in the hermits right hand in fargas copy theyre in his left
fascinated by this discovery he peers closely at each signature in turn
balkans reads at fargas
corso turns to an engraving of a jester outside a maze with two entrances
comparison of the two copies reveals that in fargas copy one of the doorways is open in balkans its bricked up
the signatures too vary at in one lf in the other
corso excitedly under his breath now were getting somewhere an old fashioned telephone bell starts ringing somewhere in the house
corso looks up
fargas doesnt hear the bell immediately
he plays on for a bar or two then pauses and listens while the telephone continues to ring
he gets to his feet
he puts the violin down and limps out
corsos open notebook now displays a chart consisting of two horizontal rows of nine boxes
one row is marked balkan the other fargas
he is busy filling in the boxes with either at or lf
he gives corso a friendly nod returns to the window and launches into the same old piece on his violin
corso has now filled in all the boxes
he studies them for a moment then circles all the lfs in red ink
corso exits and shuts the gate
his breath is visible as steam in the chilly night air
after a last backward look at the statue bordered driveway and the neglected garden he turns up his overcoat collar settles his bag on his shoulder and sets off down
the road toward the lights of sintra which are visible in the distance
his footsteps re echo from the wall that bounds the fargas property
he hasnt gone far when two headlights snap on behind him
simultaneously the car starts up and takes off with a squeal of tires
corso spins around
he stands there transfixed for a moment then dodges behind a projecting buttress as the car hurtles past missing him by a hair
the car a big dark sedan skids to a halt some twenty yards away
the driver s door opens and a tall man gets out
he momentarily hesitates when he sees corso still on his feet
just then we hear a motor vehicle a noisy one rounding the next bend
the tall man is captured by a beam of light
corso has seen him before its the mustache
the man dives back into the car and takes off fast
corso trembling with shock watches the tail lights recede and disappear
the sound of the approaching vehicle increases in volume
corso turns to stare at it
wobbling unsteadily along the road comes a lone peasant astride a ramshackle motorbike with a blown exhaust
the peasant honks as he goes by
corso retrieves his bag from the roadside
corso enters a small hotel collects his key from the reception desk and sets off in the direction of the elevator
visible in the background is the hotel lounge
two elderly female tourists are quietly conversing at one table while an overweight german couple sip cocktails
corso idly scanning the lounge as he makes for the elevator stops short a pair of legs in jeans and white sneakers are jutting from an inglenook fireplace in the
he goes over to investigate
the girl is snuggled up in an armchair with a book on her lap
he hesitates for a moment
she looks up
you didnt say you were bound for sintra
girl neither did you
corso what are you doing here
corso i can see that
girl and bumping into people unexpectedly
corso unexpectedly is right
girl are you on a business trip
indicates his shoulder bag is that why you always carry that thing around
corso doesnt answer adjusts his glasses
he looks at the book she has
she hands it to him
we see the title the devil in love by jacques cazotte you like gothic novels
girl i like books
i never travel without one
corso been traveling long
corso eyes her intrigued you said you were a student
girl did i
shrugs so i am
in a way
hotel porter appears at corsos elbow excuse me senor
corso surprised for me
are you sure
hotel porter si senor
corso turns back to the girl well sorry i disturbed you
hands back the book and turns to go
corso goes to the hotel phone and picks up the receiver with a puzzled frown yes
balkan voice over mr
corso startled balkan
how did you find me
balkan made any progress
you could call it that
corso ive examined the fargas copy
at least it looks that way
but there are discrepancies
corso in the engravings
like keys in different hands doorways open in one copy and bricked up in the other
balkan i see
corso and theres another thing
corso the ones that differ are ail signed lf
seems like some kind of riddle
a long pause are you still there
where are you anyway
balkan i think youd better get it for me
corso the old man wouldnt sell it to save his life he said as much
another long pause balkan
a click and the line goes dead
corsos hotel room
corsos lying fast asleep on his back in bed one limp arm trailing over the edge
a knock at the door
he grunts and props himself on one elbow
corso sleepily just a minute
he rolls out of bed and wraps the bedspread around his waist
then he opens the door and stands there a tousled figure with lianas teeth marks clearly visible on his chest
the girl stands outside his door
girl you left your phone off the hook
peers blearily at his watch what time is it
girl early but you have to go
corso bewildered go where for gods sake
girl the fargas place
i already saw fargas
girl i think you should see him again
corso what is this a practical joke
who the hell are you
what do you know about fargas
girl better get dressed
ill wait for you downstairs
corso and the girl walk in silence up the driveway
he eyes her mystified as she strides briskly alongside him
corso goes up to the front door and yanks at the bellpull
girl dont bother
he isnt there
corso sarcastically really
so where is he
girl over there
she points in the direction of the ornamental pond
corso stares at her then walks over to it and freezes victor fargas corpse is floating face up among the dead leaves and lily pads
an empty brandy bottle is floating alongside
corso mutters god almighty
girl ignoring her corso tries the door handle but its bolted you want to get inside
corso nods too shocked to trade words with her
she looks up at the facade
then with surprising agility she shimmies up a drainpipe beside the door and climbs onto the balcony above it
one of the french windows is broken
she reaches inside releases the catch and disappears from view
corso waits casting occasional glances at the ornamental pond and its occupant
theres the rattle of a bolt being withdrawn and the girl opens the front door from the inside
corso wait here
he enters the house and reaches the drawing room
his foot crunches on something as he crosses it on his way to the rug on which the occult books were stacked its the remains of one of fargas treasured
he pauses long enough to identify it then walks on
the books are lying scattered across the rug no sign of the nine gates shit
he looks around helplessly
then he sees it the last of the fire is still smoldering on the hearth and lying open among the ashes charred around the edges is fargas nine gates
he picks up the mutilated volume looks at it for a moment shaking his head and stows it in his canvas bag and emerges from the house
girl well did you find it
corso you know too damned much
more than i do
why do you keep following me around
what are you a groupie or something
irs cia interpol
who are you working for
girl youre wasting time asking all these questions
wed better get out of here
theres a flight from lisbon to paris at noon
we should just make it
corso whats with the we
girl there are two of us arent there
the girl is drowsing with her head on corsos shoulder
he looks down at her
corso somebodys playing a game with me
girl drowsily of course
youre a part of it
corso what exactly happened back there
girl fargas caught someone stealing i guess
corso and what do you guess happened to him
girl he drowned
corso with a little help from who
girl shrugs hes dead
corso i care
i could wind up the same way
girl not with me around to take care of you
corso i see
youre my guardian angel
girl something like that
she removes her head from his shoulder turns away and snuggles up against the window instead
corso makes his way across the bustling arrivals hall
the girl is trailing along in his wake
he glances back at her occasionally
corso takes out his us passport in readiness to show it
he looks around for the girl but theres no sign of her
a taxi drops him off in front of a modest but respectable three star hotel
he hands some money through the drivers window and heads for the entrance
he walks up to the reception desk which is presided over by a desk clerk gruber
corso hello gruber
gruber looks up acknowledges corsos presence with a curt nod of the head welcome mr
delighted to see you again
consults his computer screen we dont have any vacancies but im sure ill be able to organize something
corso thank you gruber
discreetly he slides a franc bill across the desk
gruber makes it vanish and smiles gruber thank you sir
upstairs in his room a bottle of scotch and a glass on a small desk along with balkans nine gates and fargass charred copy
a cigarette is smoldering in the ashtray beside them
corso is turning the pages of what remains of fargas copy
he pauses at a page of text bearing a distinctive ornamental capital peers at the gutter and detects that the page facing it has been torn out
he runs his finger along the rough edge
then he opens balkans copy at the same place
what is missing from the charred copy is the engraving of the hermit with the keys dog and lantern
he takes a swig of his scotch and leans back with the cigarette between his lips thinking hard
then he glances at his watch and stands up
corso canvas bag on shoulder as usual strides across the bridge toward the left bank
he walks up to the entrance of a tall well preserved old building overlooking the seine
a grim faced concierge is sits in her cubby hole
she eyes him inquiringly
corso the kessler foundation
she jerks her head in the direction of an old fashioned elevator like a gilded cage
the secretary looks up at corso with an inquiringly
corso dean corso
i have an appointment with baroness kessler
secretary consults her appointment book and her watch and rises this way
she walks ahead of him down a paneled corridor and stops outside a heavy wooden door
you have thirty minutes
she knocks on the door and opens it to reveal a spacious room filled with luxuriant potted plants
beside the window a large desk is covered with papers and books some of them open
corso follows the secretary in
baroness kessler an elegant little white haired old lady with a scarf draped around her shoulders turns her electric wheelchair to face him
she speaks with a pronounced german accent
baroness kessler mr
ive heard a great deal about you
she approaches with her left hand extended
we see that her right arm has been amputated at the elbow
corso nothing good i hope
they shake hands baroness to the secretary merci simone
to corso you hope right
the secretary exits closing the door behind her
im reassured baroness
in my trade to be spoken well of can be professionally disastrous
he surveys the room
visible through some open double doors on the right is a vast library
he focuses on it
the baroness follows the direction of his gaze
baroness yes there it is the kessler collection
corso very impressive too
i know your catalog almost by heart
baroness strange we havent met before
your name is a byword among dealers and collectors but i imagine you know your own reputation better than i do
corso it keeps the wolf from the door
smiles to change the subject were you in the middle of something
baroness beckons him over to the desk
he looks at the array of books and papers my latest work the devil history and myth a kind of biography
it will be published early next year
corso why the devil
baroness laughs i saw him one day
i was fifteen years old and i saw him as plain as i see you now cutaway top hat cane
very elegant very handsome
it was love at first sight
corso chuckles doing his best to charm the old lady three hundred years ago theyd have burned you at the stake for saying that
baroness three hundred years ago i wouldnt have said it
they both laugh nor would i have made a million by writing about it
abruptly businesslike what is it you wish to discuss mr
corso adjusts his glasses theres a book in your collection id like to examine
she smiles as if that were already obvious its the book of the nine gates of the kingdom of shadows
baroness unsurprised the nine gates
an interesting work
everyones been asking about it lately
corso stiffens almost imperceptibly really
baroness eyes him for a moment come with me
swinging her wheelchair around she steers it toward the double doors and into the library beyond them
corso follows you really believe in the devil baroness
baroness enough to devote my life and my library to him not to mention many years of work
corso everyones been asking me that lately
baroness looks mildly amused
she sends her wheelchair gliding over to a bookshelf and removes the third copy of the nine gates this book demands a certain amount of faith
corso my faith is in short supply
they both go over to a small table in the centre of the room
the baroness opens the book and turns a few pages
there are handwritten slips of paper inserted throughout
baroness i know this book extremely well
i studied it for years
corso do you have any doubts about its authenticity
baroness glances at him suspiciously none whatever
corso youre sure
baroness my knowledge of this book is profound
i wrote a biography of its author
corso aristide torchia
baroness a courageous man
he died for the sake of this very book in
he had spent many years in prague a centre of the occult
while there he studied the black arts and acquired a copy of the dread delomelanicon
this is his adaptation of that work which was written by lucifer himself
after they burned him at the stake a secret society was founded to perpetuate its memory and preserve its secrets the brotherhood
corso the brotherhood
baroness yes a kind of witches coven
for centuries they have met to read from this book and worship the prince of darkness
today theyve degenerated into a social club for bored millionaires
i myself belonged to the brotherhood many years ago but time is too precious at my age
i told them to go to the devil
she laughs at her own little joke
corso they still meet
baroness every year
corso and you say they read from this book
baroness no i took mine back when liana telfer acquired the one in toledo
victor fargas is an unbeliever he has always refused to participate so naturally they use the telfer copy
not that it has ever worked
pause they never do to be honest
corso so andrew telfer never took part
he knew nothing of these activities until that creature liana de saint damien married him for money
she used his dollars to buy the book and renovate her chateau
an old and aristocratic family the saint damiens but penniless
they have dabbled in witchcraft for hundreds of years
corso telfer hanged himself last week
baroness a brief silence
she looks stunned for a moment i see
corso he was alive the last time we spoke
baroness when was that
corso two days ago
baroness digests this looks at him keenly who exactly are you working for mr
corso my clients name is irrelevant baroness
im simply trying to authenticate his copy the one telfer sold him before he died
baroness catches on how stupid of me
i should have guessed
angry now she swings her wheelchair around to face him full on youve outstayed your welcome mr
corso i was hoping to examine your copy in detail
baroness certainly not
tell your client who can only be boris balkan to come and examine it himself if he dares
tell him not to send any more wolves in sheeps clothing
and now kindly leave
she points to the door with her stump
her wheelchair hums as she shepherds him out through the office
he opens the door to the corridor you dont know what youre getting yourself into mr
get out before its too late
corso im afraid it already is baroness
baroness some books are dangerous and this is one
corso smiles wryly so people keep telling me
thanks for your time
the baroness watches him exit
hes hardly out the door when she picks up the phone
corso walks back along the corridor
the secretary gives him a curt nod as he passes
he emerges from the building
as he does he catches sight of the mustache man leaning against the parapet of the riverside promenade across the way
the man stiffens and straightens up
corso with one eye on him starts walking
the man starts walking too keeps level with him on the other side of the street
corso comes to a cafe
for want of a better idea he goes inside sits down at a table orders a drink
looking out the cafe window he sees the man leaning against the parapet in his former pose watching
the man lights a small cigar without taking his eyes off corso
corso is still sitting at his table which now has several checks on it
the lights come on blotting out his view of the street through the window
all he can now see is a reflection of the cafes interior including his own seated figure
he drums his fingers on the table glances at his watch and deliberates
he adds up his check and puts some money on the table
then settling his bag on his shoulder he makes for the door
he peers across the street sees no sign of the man and exits
still no sign of the man
he sets off along the sidewalk glancing across the street as he does so
then over his shoulder he catches sight of a car with dipped headlights a dark colored sedan crawling along the curb some twenty yards behind him
on impulse he darts across the street to the riverside promenade and dashes down the flight of steps that leads to the quay
the cars headlights blaze up
it accelerates tires squealing and swerves across the one way street in pursuit
corso races down the steps hears the car skid to a halt and sprints off along the quay
a couple of hundred yards along the quay he runs out of steam and slows turns to look no sign of the man no sound of pursuing footsteps
relieved but still wary he leans against the embankment wall to catch his breath and light a cigarette
then with a final backward look he walks on to the next flight of steps
hes halfway up them when the man a tall menacing figure appears at the top
he turns to flee but the man is too quick for him
he darts down the steps and corso misses the last couple of steps and lands face down on the quayside
the man is on him in a flash
he bends down and yanks the strap of the bag off his shoulder
corso resists hugs the bag protectively gets kicked in the stomach doubles up and hangs on for dear life
as he lies there with the man kicking him repeatedly and tugging at the strap he sees silhouetted against the yellowish misty glow of the nearest streetlight a ghostly figure
flying down the steps its the girl with her duffel coat streaming out behind her like supermans cape
the man has finally gotten the bag away from corso
just as he straightens up and turns to go the girl performs a flying leap and kicks him
he grunts and goes sprawling on his back dropping the bag
the girl is stooping to retrieve the bag when the man scrambles to his feet and lunges at her
he throws a punch at her head
although she blocks most of its force he catches her a glancing blow on the nose
she reacts like lightning kicks him in the groin
he yelps and goes into a crouch
then with a spin kick she floors him once more
he lies there spitting blood and glaring up at her
she seems to have knocked the fight out of him at last
with one wary eye on the man the girl picks up the shoulder bag and turns to corso whos struggling to his feet
beyond her he sees the man get up and make for the steps
corso hey hes getting away
the girl merely turns to look
corso sets off after the man who has already started up the steps and just manages to grab one of his legs
the man kicks himself free and continues up the steps with corso clumsily following a few feet behind
waiting at the top of the steps engine idling and passenger door open is the dark sedan a mercedes
corso reaches street level in time to catch a glimpse of the glamorous blonde behind the wheel its liana telfer
the man jumps in and slams the door
the car burns rubber as it accelerates away
the girl calmly climbs the last few steps with corso bag in one hand and his glasses in the other
she hands them to him
girl theyre broken
you should be more careful
corso leaning back against the promenade wall and breathing heavily stares at her with his mouth open
he slides down the wall and subsides into a sitting position on the sidewalk
one lens of his glasses cracked is still sitting on the sidewalk with his back against the wall
the girl is sitting beside him
he produces a crumpled cigarette and lights it
it takes him quite a while his hands are shaking so badly
the girls nose is bleeding
she wipes it on her sleeve
corso produces a handkerchief as crumpled as his cigarette and hands it to her
corso when did you learn all that
corso aims a feeble kick in the air that stuff
girl casually oh ages ago
corso no shit
she gets up and holds out her hand
he takes it and rises with an effort
he flicks his cigarette over the parapet
they walk off along the promenade side by side and head for the hotel
corso goes up to the reception desk where gruber is on duty
corso i need a favor gruber
gruber looks up registers his broken glasses and disheveled condition and the girl is standing in the background certainly mr
corso liana telfer maiden name saint damien
thirtyish blond dishy
probably accompanied by a big man with a clark gable mustache
gruber make some notes on a pad i want to know if theyre staying at some hotel here in paris
gruber it could take a little time
corso of course
start with the five stars
theyre the best bet
gruber very good sir
pause are you feeling all right
corso ive felt better
let me know if you locate them
gruber watches corso and the girl walk to the elevators
in his bedroom corso is filling a plastic laundry bag with ice from a tray in the minibar
the girl is sitting on the bed with her head tilted back and a bloodstained handkerchief to her nose
corso here hold this against your neck and lie back
sits down beside her and hands her the ice pack
she applies it to the nape of her neck lies back and shuts her eyes you were great down there by the river
i havent really thanked you
she opens her eyes and smiles at him like to tell me whats going on
girl shrugs faintly someones after your book
corso they didnt have to kill fargas to get it
they didnt have to mutilate his copy either
they tore out the engravings and ditched the rest
theres got to be more to it than that
girl her nose has stopped bleeding do you believe in the devil corso
corso im being paid to
girl smiles im a bit of a devil myself
she reaches up removes his glasses and puts them on the bedside table
corso eyes her uncertainly
her nose starts to bleed again
she puts her fingertips to it and inspects the blood on them
very deliberately she dabbles them in the blood some more reaches up and gently draws four vertical lines down his face from his forehead to his mouth where her fingertips
corsos face approaches hers
they melt into a passionate kiss then she pushes him away rolls him over on his back unbuttons his shirt and rests her palms on his chest
playfully she runs her forefinger over the imprint of lianas teeth
girl smiles mischievously would you know a devil if you saw one
corso tieless and unshaven descends the stairs to the lobby carrying his beg
the junior desk clerk a spotty youth is dozing on a chair behind the reception desk
corso goes over and raps on the desk
the junior desk clerk springs to his feet like
corso jerks his chin at the door behind him
corso do you have a photocopier back there
clerk er yes monsieur
corso may i use it
clerk are you a guest monsieur
corso you mean i dont look like one
clerk of course monsieur
this way monsieur
he lifts a flap and shows corso into the back office corso room
and get them to send up breakfast for two
corso deposits his bag beside the photocopier and takes out balkans nine gates
he opens it at the first engraving the knight with a finger to his lips and inverts it
positioning it on the photocopier he shuts the flap and presses the start button
the photocopy glides out into the tray
he goes back to his room quietly closing the door behind him
the girl is lying sprawled among the rumpled sheets fast asleep
her clothes are draped over a chair with her backpack alongside
stealthily corso takes balkans nine gates from his bag and places it behind the minibar then goes into the bathroom
corso with his hair damp from the shower and a towel around his waist is halfway through shaving when theres a knock on the bathroom door
one cheek daubed with foam he opens it to find himself confronted by a floor waiter check pad and ballpoint in hand
waiter bonjour monsieur
votre petit djeuner
taking the pad he emerges into the bedroom and scribbles his signature then stops short theres a breakfast cart in the middle of the room but the bed is empty
and the girls clothes and backpack have disappeared
corso where is she
corso madame ou elle est
waiter je ne sais pas msieur
he makes for the door and exits
corso catches hold of the door just as its closing puts his head out into the corridor looks right and left
no one in sight but the floor waiter who casts a puzzled glance over his shoulder as he walks off
he steps back into the bedroom and shuts the door
he stands there for a moment frowning at the empty bed
then abruptly he dashes over to the minibar and looks behind it
his fears are groundless the nine gates is still there
just then the phone rings
he picks up the receiver and puts it to his ear on the clean shaven side of his face
balkan voice over come down
im in the cafe across the street
corso wearing his crumpled overcoat and carrying his bag emerges from the hotel and crosses the street to the cafe opposite
he enters and looks around catches sight of balkans sleek gray head at a table in the corner
he goes over to him
corso you sure as hell get around
he sits down with the shoulder bag between his feet
a waiter appears at his elbow un caf noir sil vous plait
the waiter nods and withdraws
balkan studies corsos face through his glasses notes the glasses with the cracked lens
corso yeah like someone tried to total me a couple times
aside from that three people have died on me since i took this job
thinks for a moment well two
telfer was dead already
balkan i dont follow you
corso its simple enough
you give me the nine gates and they start dropping like flies
im thinking of giving it back
balkan who are you talking about
corso my pal bernie feldman for one
balkan the book dealer
he was holding your book for me
someone was after it
he wouldnt give it to them
a moment of silence
then balkan emits a chuckle
the chuckle becomes a guffaw the guffaw gives way to peal after peal of uproarious laughter
he slaps his thighs and rocks back and forth his face turns puce his eyes fill with tears
his hilarity is so deafening that the cafes other customers turn to stare
corso too stares at balkan as if hes gone crazy
balkans mirth gradually subsides
he removes his glasses and mops his eyes
eventually still chuckling
balkan poor fellow
very creditable of him
corso refrains from commenting on this outburst then theres fargas
the waiter brings corsos coffee
balkan waits for him to put it on the table and leave
balkan what about fargas
corso dead too
balkan how do you know
corso i saw him and his copy or what was left of it
someone had snatched the engravings and tried to burn the rest
balkan stares at him for a moment how tragic
what about the kessler copy
corso the old woman says its authentic but i didnt get a chance to look at it closely
as soon as she guessed you were behind my visit she threw me out
you arent her flavor of the month
balkan you must see her again
you must get me that copy or examine it at least
corso derisively are you kidding
id have to be the invisible man
balkan reaches into his black briefcase and produces a big manila envelope try this
corso takes the envelope and looks at it
its addressed to baroness friede kessler
kessler building lobby
corso canvas bag on shoulder as usual hands the envelope to the secretary who takes it and walks off down the corridor
a black and white photo fills the screen it shows a young and beautiful baroness kessler flanked by two men in ss uniform
one of them is heinrich himmler
baroness kessler is scowling down at a wartime number of signal the nazi propaganda magazine
its lying open on her desk with balkans envelope beside it
the secretary shows corso in
the baroness addresses her crisply
baroness merci simone
the secretary nods and exits
fixing corso with a cold challenging stare baroness kessler feeds the magazine into a shredder beside her desk
she no longer looks such a dear little old lady
in the kessler library corso is seated at a table on which reposes the kessler copy of the nine gates
beside it lies his notebook and the photocopies of balkans engravings
his shoulder bag is hanging on the chairback his overcoat draped over it
he reaches into his pocket and produces a cigarette takes out his lighter
baroness blackmail doesnt entitle you to smoke in my library mr
corso stops short and looks back through the double doors into her office shes seated behind her desk like a graven image watching him intently
he reinserts the cigarette in its pack and pockets his lighter
getting down to work he opens the nine gates and extracts one of the baronesss handwritten slips reads it to himself in a low voice
corso i will recognize your servants my brethren by the sign that adorns some part of their body a scar or mark of your making
he replaces the slip
the baroness cranes her body largely obscures her view of the table
corso turns some pages and comes to the engraving of the knight with a finger to his lips
he compares it with the photocopy the castle has three towers instead of four
he examines the margin of the engraving through his magnifying glass to ascertain the presence of something he already knows will be there an lf
he turns to the chart in his notebook which has already acquired a third row of nine boxes
he writes kessler beside it and enters an lf in the first box
the second engraving the hermit with the keys appears to be identical and the signature is at
an at goes down in the second box
the third engraving is different the angelic archer has an arrow in his quiver whereas the photocopy of balkan s counterpart does not
this one too is signed lf
corso enters an lf in the third box
camera moves in until the chart fills the screen
a long shot of corso from behind
he leans back and stretches glances in the direction of the office baroness kessler is no longer at her desk
absolute silence reigns
he resumes work turns to the ninth engraving the naked woman riding the dragon with a castle ablaze in the background
theres a loud thud and the engraving sways and blurs
the screen goes black
fade back in
an electrical hum punctuated by a strange rhythmical series of clicks and thuds click thud click thud click thud
corso sitting slumped over the table comes to
he groans and laboriously straightens up feels his head and winces
the strange sound impinges on his consciousness he looks around vaguely for its source and discovers it baroness kesslers wheelchair has been left in forward gear
complete with occupant its colliding again and again with the wall beneath a window on the other side of the room
corso who can just glimpse the top of the old ladys head from behind sees it jerk forward at each impact
he struggles to his feet
unsteadily he makes his way over to the wheelchair and swivels it around starts back with a muffled exclamation
baroness kessler has been strangled with her hermes scarf her cheeks are blue her eyes and tongue are protruding
unobstructed the laden wheelchair takes off across the library and heads for the double doors which are now closed
it runs into them full tilt bursts them open and continues on its way
instantly smoke comes billowing into the library accompanied by a crackle of flames
the wheelchair disappears into the murk
corso wildly scans the table for baroness kesslers nine gates but its gone
snatching up his notebook and abandoning his shoulder bag and overcoat he makes for the office at a run
the office is thick with smoke and illumined by a fiery glow
corso pauses in the doorway shielding his face from the heat with one hand and surveys the scene
the baroness and her wheelchair have come to rest in the midst of a bonfire of books and papers
corso can just make out her copy of the nine gates on top
the flames are already engulfing it
corso takes a last look then dashes through the smoke to the door and exits
with smoke billowing after him corso dashes along the corridor through the lobby which is deserted and out onto the landing
on the landing corso bumps into the secretary who has just emerged from the elevator
she gives a little shriek and drops a paper bag
half a dozen oranges go bouncing ahead of corso as he races down the stairs
in the hallway he almost upends the concierge whos wielding a broom in her curlers
leaping aside with a startled yell she speeds him on his way with some choice words then peers up the stairwell the upper stories are already wreathed in smoke and
tenants have come out onto the landings
the secretary comes pelting down the stairs screaming at the top of her lungs
outside corso douses his head in the basin of a fountain shakes off the drips and massages his face
then he leans against the basin and looks around
hes all alone in the little square
he takes out a crumpled cigarette and inserts it between his lips with dripping fingers gropes for his lighter and vainly tries to light it
wearily he removes the cigarette from his lips and tosses it away
all at once he spots a huge great dane watching him from the mouth of an alleyway
corso and the great dane stare at each other
then the silence is broken by a fire engines siren faint at first but growing louder
he reaches an intersection and looks around the corner
the kessler building is ablaze
tongues of flame and clouds of smoke are issuing from the windows of the upper stories
fire engines and squad cars are drawn up outside firemen are directing their hoses onto the flames cordoning off the street and keeping curious spectators away
corso looking wrung out crosses the street and makes for the hotel entrance
hes just going through the revolving doors into the lobby when the girl appears on the inside
hooking her arm through his she steers him around and back outside again in one continuous movement
girl mutters just keep going
still firmly gripping his arm she takes him out onto the sidewalk corso baffled what are you playing at
girl see those men talking with your friend gruber
corso turns to look
inside the lobby two men in trenchcoats are standing at the reception desk in conversation with gruber police
corso at that moment gruber looks past them at corso
he briefly locks eyes with him but shows no sign of recognition shit
he turns and walks off with her at his side
he goes to enter a glass phone booth girl you look better without that old bag and coat of yours
they didnt do anything for you
corso shuts the door in her face
he picks up the receiver inserts a coin punches out a number
the girl pulls a funny face at him through the glass
corsos only response is to turn away and cup his hand around the receiver
into the phone gruber
its me corso
can you talk
gruber no sir
corso but you can listen
gruber certainly sir
corso id like you to do something for me
gruber enters a restaurant bar crowded with lunchtime customers
he spots corso at the far end of the bar with the girl beside him
shes sucking up some colorful beverage through a straw
gruber acknowledges her presence with a formal nod
corso you dont have it
gruber there was nothing in the place you described sir
he turns to the girl i suppose you didnt take it
girl you still dont trust me do you
gruber clears his throat i think i may have the answer sir
someone visited your room earlier on while my young colleague was on duty your wife
corso my wife
i dont have any wife
gruber thats what i told him
corso could he describe her
gruber nods thirtyish blond dishy
gruber which reminds me sir the lady and gentleman you mentioned theyre staying at the hotel crillon suite
corso good for you gruber
thanks a lot
gruber always glad to be of service mr
corso i owe you one for those cops too
gruber ah yes sir
what exactly did they want
gruber they expressed an interest in your whereabouts
what did you tell them
gruber that you were out
corso anything else
gruber they asked if i knew whether you had recently visited portugal
gruber i said that our guests do not make a habit of providing us with their itineraries
corso extracts a franc bill from his billfold and slips it into grubers hand
gruber acknowledges this with a gracious inclination of the head for what its worth gruber i dont know what they think ive done but im innocent
gruber impassively naturally mr
all our guests are
hotel crillon forecourt
a cab drives up to the entrance
the doorman opens the door corso and the girl get out
corso turns to pay the cabby the doorman twitches an eyebrow at the girlss jeans and sneakers
corso and the girl enter the lobby which is bustling with activity
they stand aside as an elevator door opens and some camera toting tourists emerge
girl whatll you do when you see them
corso dryly hide behind you probably
they enter the elevator
the doors glide shut
they walk down the corridor checking numbers as they go
theyve almost reached the door of suite when it opens abruptly
they jump back in alarm
a bellhop emerges backside first towing a baggage cart laden with suitcases
corso and the girl hide in a passage a few feet to their rear as the bellhop sets off down the corridor in the opposite direction leaving the door open
corso pads silently up to the door and enters with the girl at his heels
a deserted sitting room with an old herald tribune lying abandoned on the floor and two dirty coffee cups on the table
the bedroom door is ajar
the girl stands watching as corso tiptoes over pushes it open
the room is empty the bed unmade
corso downstairs quick
they use the stairs for speeds sake
panting they halt at the foot of the last flight and scan the spacious but crowded lobby
its a moment before they catch sight of the man standing at the cashiers desk with liana beside him
better grab a cab or well lose them
they thread their way across the lobby and make for the exit unobserved
corso and the girl have stationed themselves at the cab rank on the island
corso sees a cab approaching amid the stream of traffic and tries to flag it down but its taken
the doorman hands liana into the passenger seat of the mercedes sedan while the man supervises the bellhop as he stows their baggage in the trunk
a rolls pulls up behind the mercedes closely followed by a yellow lamborghini driven by a smartly dressed mustachioed arab with a blond bombshell beside him
the arab gets out leaving his keys in the ignition
nonchalantly signaling to the doorman to park his car he disappears into the hotel with the blond in tow
the doorman acknowledges his gesture before smilingly accepting a tip from the man who gets in behind the wheel
girl theyre going
corso sights another cab approaching and cavorts into the roadway waving his arms like a madman
the cab honks and swerves to avoid him obstructing some other vehicles which honk in their turn
frustrated yet again beyond him we see the mercedes drive off
with a screech of tires the yellow lamborghini takes off fast in reverse
skirting the island it backs out into the oncoming traffic
then slammed into first it skids to a halt beside the curb at corsos elbow
the passenger door opens the girl cranes over and looks up at him from behind the wheel
corso stares at her for an instant then jumps in
the lamborghini sets off after the mercedes which is not far ahead
it threads its way into the stream of traffic pursued for a few yards along the sidewalk by the wildly gesticulating doorman
the girl is expertly piloting the lamborghini through heavy traffic
the mercedes can be seen a few cars ahead
corso couldnt you have pinched something a bit less conspicuous
girl dont be so picky
most people would give their eyeteeth for a ride in this
corso surveys the cars luxurious interior opens the glove compartment removes the contents and inspects them some cds the car papers a pair of expensive wrap around sunglasses an arab
visible through the windshield the mercedes is cruising along several hundred yards ahead of the lamborghini
corso we cant sit on their tail forever
theyre bound to smell a rat
a long shot of the lamborghini accelerating to draw level with the mercedes
the man with liana at his elbow glances sideways
the mans point of view the lamborghini with a figure in shades and a keffiyeh at the wheel
its the girl
she looks straight ahead as she passes
no sign of corso
corso who has been hiding below door level sits up
after a quick glance over his shoulder he settles back in his seat and lights a cigarette covertly eyeing the girl
girl how do i look
corso you look like a million
a million barrels of oil
the lamborghini passes an exit
the girl who has discarded the keffiyeh and shades is driving with one eye on the rearview mirror
the mercedes indicates right slows and turns off at the exit
girl sit tight
the girl pulls over onto the shoulder and stands on the brakes
throwing the car into reverse almost before its stationary she hurtles backward along the shoulder
a couple of cars flash their headlights and blare as the lamborghini reaches the exit and skids to a halt narrowly missing a large truck that has beaten it to
the lamborghini crawls along behind the truck as it grinds up the single lane exit road
corso impatiently cmon cmon
the girl blasts the truck with her horn and flashes her headlights
the trucks only response is to slow still further before pulling up at a t junction
corso what in hells the matter with him
clearly visible in the glare of the lamborghinis headlights an arm emerges from the trucks cab window and gives a prolonged one fingered salute
the arm disappears the truck moves off at last and turns left across the bridge spanning the freeway
the mercedes is nowhere in sight
the lamborghini moves up to the t junction and stands there engine purring
girl take your pick
corso no you
you know everything
girl if you say so
she turns off right
its dark now and the lamborghini is speeding along an avenue of poplar trees
no sign of the mercedes
girl we lost them
corso not at this speed
they must have gone the other way
girl you mean i dont know everything after all
corso turn around
they pass a small intersection on the right
the girl backs into it but doesnt complete the maneuver
something catches her eye
girl thirtyish blond dishy what was her name again
girl no her maiden name
corso saint damien
corsos point of view
the lamborghinis headlights have illuminated a signpost
one of the signs reads st
it points the way they were going
the girl turns out into the road and drives on in the original direction
the girl slows as they pass the st
damien sign at the entrance to the village itself
girl should we drive straight in
corso in this thing
we might as well hang a bell around our necks
corso and the girl walk gingerly down the old village street
a faint glow emanates from a few windows in the time worn houses but the street itself is utterly deserted
they pause at the mouth of a small equally deserted square church on one end village stores shuttered and in darkness two or three parked cars none of them the
corso looks around irresolutely sees light coming from the basement window of a bakers shop
side by side corso and the girl look down through the basement window
inside a flour smeared baker is deftly preparing a tray of croissants for the oven
baker looks up wipes his hands on his smock and walks over to the window
corso nous cherchons la maison de madame de saint damien
baker le chateau vous voulez dire
corso to the girl chateau
thats it got to be
to the baker ou il est le chateau
baker gestures la route aprss gllse msieur
the girl is driving slowly along a country road flanked on one side by woods
a pair of ornate wrought iron gates and a gatehouse loom up on the left
corso keep going
theres a light on in the gatehouse
they glimpse the gatekeeper leaning against his door smoking as they cruise past
the lamborghini backs into the mouth of a farm track
the girl and corso get out cross the road and strike off into the woods
hugging the trees that border it on one side corso and the girl are making their way up a long straight graveled driveway
the lighted gatehouse is to their rear the lights of the chateau can be seen ahead
hearing the sound of a car behind them they turn to see its headlights swing in through the gates
they quickly take cover in the trees and watch the car a big limo glide past then emerge and walk on
they observe the chateau a substantial th century mansion from the edge of the trees
the forecourt in which come expensive looking cars are parked one of them the mercedes is illuminated by the the lights inside the building
the limo has pulled up at the foot of the steps and the occupants a smartly dressed elderly couple are being greeted by a tuxedoed butler while their suitcases are
removed from the trunk and carried in after them by a manservant
corso and the girl have worked their way around to the side of the chateau
one of the lighted windows gives them a view of the upper reaches of the chateaus great hall with its minstrel gallery and lofty vaulted ceiling
they climb on a stone bench for a better look
inside overlooked by an array of ancestral portraits some guests are inaudibly conversing in groups
men and women alike are attired in long black robes resembling monks habits and all have silver pentacles suspended from their necks on silver chains
their cowls are thrown back to reveal the heads and faces beneath
a motley assortment of people most of them middle or late middle aged one or two of oriental origin
no sign of liana or the man
girl see them anywhere
girl they arent there
corso and the girl continue to make their way around the house cautiously
peering through a semi basement window they see two chefs chopping vegetables at a big kitchen table
they pause at a loss and look up at the house
several of the second floor windows are illuminated and one of them has some creeper covered trelliswork running up to its balcony
the girl with corso close behind her has just reached the top of the trelliswork
she clambers over onto the balcony
corso scales the last few fact reaches for the balustrade straddles it and joins her
together they peer through the french windows
with them we see a bedroom decorated in a very feminine style
two of lianas suitcases are on the floor near the bed
a third with her discarded clothes beside it is lying open on the bed itself
liana has stripped to her panties
they watch as she slips them off goes to a wardrobe and takes out a black robe and silver pentacle like the ones we saw downstairs
pulling the robe over her head she smooths it down dons the pentacle and inspects herself in a mirror in the corner of the room
corso takes advantage of her preoccupation to try the french windows
they wont budge
he turns to the girl and shrugs then raises his foot and kicks the glass in
liana spins around with a terrified cry and stands there transfixed
corso reaches inside turns the knob opens the french windows and steps into the room
the girl follows
corso where is it
liana how dare you
corso that book isnt yours madame
liana get out of here both of you
corso goes over to the bed and empties the suitcase onto the floor
among its contents is the nine gates
liana instinctively lunges for it but the girl blocks her
corso to the girl careful she bites
hes stooping to retrieve the book when the door opens and the man robed and barefooted stands framed in the doorway
corso turns quickly with the book in his hand the girl stiffens
liana makes a dive for the bedside table and produces a chrome plated automatic from the drawer flips the safety catch
liana to corso and the girl dont move either of you
to the man get the book bruno
corso takes a tentative step backward as bruno approaches him with his left hand extended
he reluctantly surrenders the book
bruno rewards him for his co operation with a vicious right hook to the jaw
corso goes down losing his glasses yet again
groggily he crawls around in search of them
bruno joins liana steering well clear of the girl
he hands her the nine gates and carefully transfers the automatic from her hand to his
liana take them downstairs and lock them up
well deal with them later theres no time now
bruno to corso italian accent turn around
corso who has scrambled to his feet complies
bruno applies the muzzle of the automatic to the nape of his neck
bruno to the girl you
any trouble i blow his brains
the girl makes for the door
bruno prods corso into motion
liana stares after them for a moment clasping the nine gates to her chest
a long passage lined with more ancestral portraits
the ancient floorboards creek as the girl obediently walks ahead of corso and bruno whose automatic is leveled at corsos back
they reach the end of the passage
bruno go left
down the stairs
they descend a staircase to ground level
another long passage confronts them much like the first but floored with marble
bruno avanti avanti
a door at the end leads into a stone flagged passage with whitewashed walls
they make their way along it until they reach a heavy oak door
bruno to the girl open it
the girl does so to reveal a small landing and a flight of stone steps leading downward
she stops short the steps have no guardrail and the cellar beneath is shrouded in darkness
bruno prods corso through the doorway until all three are on the landing then throws a light switch
bare bulbs shed little light on the steps but illuminate a large vaulted chamber below
its the chateaus wine cellar oak barrels and racks of bottles thick with dust and cobwebs are housed behind an iron grille with a door in it
the door is ajar the key in the lock
bruno to the girl move
she sets off down the steps
corso follows with bruno at his heels
halfway down corso pretends to stumble he crouches and turns in a single movement
bruno following close behind trips over him
corso seizes his robe and yanks at it helping him on his way
corso to the girl watch out
she plasters herself against the wall to avoid brunos somersaulting body
the automatic escapes from his hand and slithers across the flagstones as he comes to rest with a sickening thud at the foot of the steps
the girl follows him down and picks it up
corso reaches the foot of the steps and rolls bruno over on his back
hes out cold with blood oozing from a broken nose
girl faintly admiring i didnt know you had it in you
corso another thing you didnt know
he takes hold of brunos ankles and with the girls assistance hauls him through the grille into the inner cellar
he stares down at the man for a moment hey give me a hand
i want his gear
he starts to peel off brunos robe shuts the grille door locks it and tosses the key into a corner
they cautiously retrace their steps along the marble floored passage
corso is wearing brunos robe and pentacle over his clothes with his shoes and trouser bottoms visible below the hem
they pass the stairs they descended and continue on their way turning a corner
as they do so they hear a faint intermittent hum
they pause to listen then walk on
the sound grows louder and more distinct somewhere in the chateau voices are chanting in unison
turning another corner they find themselves in an anteroom that terminates in two massive double doors
the chanting is coming from beyond them
corso walks over to the doors with the girl at his heels
he grasps the handle
girl hisses no
up to the gallery
the chanting is even louder now
they reach the top of some uncarpeted stairs and cautiously open a small door
a wave of sound hits them
they steal through the doorway into the shadowy gallery and peer over a balustrade
at the far end of the huge room in a dais draped in black with some shallow steps leading up to it
on the wall above the dais hangs an inverted silver crucifix on the dais itself which is flanked by a pair of outsize black candles in three foot silver candlesticks
liana stands facing the hall from behind a silver lectern on which reposes the nine gates
arrayed in the body of the hall are the guests each holding a lighted black candle
liana and the guests are taking it in turns like priest and congregation to intone passages from the latin text of the nine gates
corso quietly to the girl you stay here and cover me
im going down
pulling the cowl over his head he sneaks down the spiral staircase secretes himself in the rear rank of guests and concentrates on liana and the book as the litany
all at once unseen by us the doors swing open with a crash and balkans deep bass voice punctures the air on a derisive note
balkan mumbo jumbo mumbo jumbo mumbo jumbo
the guests stop chanting and fifty cowled heads turn to look for the source of this unseemly interruption
up on the dais liana freezes
balkan mumbo jumbo mumbo jumbo mumbo jumbo
looking over life size in his dark and elegant double breasted suit he strides toward the dais
any guests who fail to get out of his way in time are brusquely elbowed aside
liana watches him transfixed as he climbs the steps and turns to face the guests
balkan look around you yes all of you
what do you see
they involuntarily turn to look at each other ill tell you a bunch of buffoons in fancy dress
what are you expecting an apparition
im the only apparition youll see tonight
you really think the prince of darkness would deign to manifest himself to the likes of you
he never has and he never will never
he closes the nine gates with a snap and holds it up you read from his book yes but you have no conception of its true power
i alone have grasped its secret
i alone have fathomed the masters grand design
i alone am worthy to enjoy the fruits of that discovery absolute power to determine my own destiny
liana finding her voice at last youre insane boris
puts out her hand give it back at once
balkan rounds on her as for you liana de saint damien youre even guiltier than the rest of this pathetic rabble
you have at least some idea of what this book can do in the right hands yet you lend yourself to these farcical proceedings these orgies of ageing flesh conducted
in the masters name
youre a charlatan
liana tries to grab the book but balkan holds it above his head
she claws his cheeks in desperation
he clasps his face dropping the book
liana makes a dive for it but balkan pounces on her
they roll over struggling fiercely
balkan grabs her by the throat
she tries to break his grip but he redoubles it
halfway down the dais steps with balkan on top of her she fights for breath
her suffocated agonized face is turned toward the hall
the guests shrink back in horror some of them dropping their candles
hysterical screams rend the air
corso comes to life
hampered by his robe he makes for dais as fast as he can scattering frightened guests in the process
he takes hold of balkans shoulders and tries to haul him off liana
balkan still throttling her turns to look
he glares at corso through his heavy glasses his features contorted with rage
then removing one hand from lianas throat he deals corso a backhanded blow that sends him reeling
liana seizes the chance to break free
she crawls away but balkan is too quick for her grabbing her pentacle chain from behind he proceeds to garrotte her with it
liana now on her knees scrabbles at the chain that is biting into her neck
her face turns purple her tongue begins to protrude
corso looks around wildly for a weapon
he seizes one of the three foot candlesticks and raises it over his head
suddenly girl off screen dont corso
startled he lowers the candlestick and looks up
the girl is perched on the gallery balustrade just above him
too preoccupied with balkan and liana to wonder what her game is corso raises the candlestick once more
the girl lands on top of corso bearing him to the ground and immobilizes him with a hammerlock
corso get off me
hell kill her
girl leave them
balkan completes his grisly work lianas purple face is all too reminiscent of baroness kesslers
with a final tug at the chain he plants one foot in the small of lianas back and sends her limp body sprawling across the floor of the hall
screams and cries of horror go up from the guests who have recoiled still further
balkan straightens up a somewhat dishevelled but still imposing figure despite the scratches on his cheeks
even his glasses are still in place
he leans forward eyes narrowed in a mock menacing way and stamps his foot
balkan in a voice like thunder boooh
with more hysterical screams and cries of dismay the guests turn tall and flee the hall like a herd of panic stricken cattle jostling each other in their eagerness to
get out the door
calmly without so much as a glance at the girl corso or lianas corpse balkan smoothes his hair down picks up the nine gates and strides majestically after them
the girl releases her grip on corsos arm gets off him and rises to her knees
he sits up nursing his elbow and staring at her with blank incomprehension
corso why did you do it
girl some things are meant to happen
that was one of them
corso dont give me that crap again
you were working for him all along
girl funny i thought you were
corso you played me for a sucker the two of you
i dont intend to take the rap for that maniac
girl he just murdered someone with a roomful of witnesses
that lets you off the hook for the other killings
you should be grateful
corso im ecstatic
he gets to his feet
the girl rises too starts to pat the dust off his robe
corso impatiently evades her hand wheres he off to
girl what do you care
your job is done
this is as far as you need to go
corso the hell it is
the sonofabitch owes me the other half of my fee
girl ironically of course its just business
i thought your curiosity had gotten the better of you
corso okay so whats meant to happen next
girl you really want to know
the girl with corso red eyed and unshaven beside her is driving along a country road bordered by rolling fields wreathed in gray mist
theyve appropriated lianas mercedes sedan
corso has taken over the wheel
the girl is fast asleep with her head on his shoulder
the girl is back behind the wheel corso smoking
dazzled by the setting sun she lowers the visor
the mercedes rounds a bend
visible in the distance crisply silhouetted against the afterglow is a castle
its the one of which we saw a backlighted photograph on balkans wall
the girl pulls up some distance from the archway that was once the castle gate
a dark green range rover is already parked beside it
corso and the girl get out and briefly survey the derelict building
a glimmer of light is issuing from the arrow slits in one of the turrets
they cross the deserted courtyard which is littered with fallen masonry
they climb a dilapidated flight of stone steps to the battlements and walk along them to the tower
they pause outside the moldering old door and listen
a mans voice is faintly audible
corso puts his hand on the handle
the girl gropes in the pocket of her duffel coat and produces the chromium plated automatic holds it out
corso hesitates briefly then stuffs it in his jacket pocket
he opens the door and enters followed by the girl
they are looking down into the interior of the turret which forms a cylindrical chamber
theyre on a small landing from which a steep flight of unprotected stone steps curves down and around the inner wall to the floor of the chamber
the floor littered with debris including worm eaten beams that have fallen from the ceiling far above consists of massive age old planks
a large circle has been chalked in the middle of the floor and within it a square divided into nine boxes numbered
each box contains some unrelated object a rusty knife a piece of cord a stone a gold ring a serpentine bracelet a glass vial a small pile of earth a
quill pen an hourglass
the chamber is illuminated by half a dozen kerosene lamps located around the circle but outside it
also near the circle is a campers collapsible table with various objects on it a black briefcase the nine gates a magnifying glass a vacuum flask and mug
on the floor beside the table is an open suitcase with more books spilling out of it
the voice we heard from outside is that of balkan but a balkan unlike any we have seen before no jacket or necktie shirt sleeves rolled up vest half unbuttoned
strands of gray hair falling over his scratched and sweating face cheeks flushed eyes ablaze with excitement
hes kneeling in front of the numbered boxes and babbling to himself in an expressionless monotone balkan
eight doors come before the serpent that guards the word teth enea novem oded the number nine which holds the final secret the mystery of mysteries
the serpent is the beast that always sleeps with one eye open and is reflected in the mirror of knowledge
giggles triumphantly eight engravings plus one or one plus eight which coincides with the number that st
john of patmos attributed to the beast
corso to the girl he needs therapy
balkan proceeds to scrawl some numerals on the floor with a piece of chalk six plus six plus six equals eighteen
one and eight
even more triumphantly one plus eight equals nine
corso starts to descend the steps
the girl stays behind sits down on the top step props her chin on her hand and watches the proceedings
balkan rises with chalk dust all over the knees of his pants
he goes to his briefcase and takes out a sheaf of torn engravings
corso has reached the foot of the steps
balkan turning to resume his place in the circle catches sight of him
he freezes in disbelief and a long moment passes before he speaks
balkan what are you doing here
corso i thought id drop in before they put you behind bars
balkan go away
corso we had a deal remember
balkan a deal
you bungled it damn you
you failed me all along the line
thanks to your lack of initiative i was compelled to do my own dirty work
and i did it
i got these myself
see here they are
brandishes the engravings speaks with mounting vehemence nine engravings or nine doors and only an initiate can open them
each door has two keys each engraving discloses a number a secret element and keyword to be interpreted in the light of reason and the cabbala the one true philosophy
corso i want my money
balkan dont you understand whats going on here
returns to the circle kneels down again and deals out the engravings like playing cards one to a box leaving three boxes empty you have before you the mystery of
which men have dreamed throughout the centuries
thousands have died an agonizing death in hopes of just a glimpse of what youre about to see
whats that old nick in person
balkan dont be ridiculous
he has never appeared to anyone never
hes a spirit the spirit of pure evil
he manifests himself through his servants of whom im proud to be one
rises walks quickly over to the little table and opens the nine gates
turning over several pages he tears out an engraving three copies but only nine of their twenty seven engravings hold the key and i have them all
tears out two more engravings in quick succession i have only to complete the sequence
then the serpent will enter the seal of saturn and i i shall enter the ninth gate
corso cut the crap and write me a cheque
balkan returns to the circle kneels down once more and neatly positions the three engravings in the empty boxes
then he rises goes to the table and pours himself a drink from a flask
he gargles with it swallows and shakes himself like a wet dog
whatever the flask contained it seems to have invigorated him
he dribbles gasoline around the circle then picks up one of the kerosene lamps and hurls it at the floor
the lamp smashes and ignites the gasoline
instantly hes ringed with fire
he draws himself up and stands erect in the center of the circle with flames dancing all around him
balkan i give you my allegiance master
i surrender myself unto you body and soul
let me fear neither noose nor sword nor poison
let me walk unscathed among lepers and the plague ridden
erase me from the book of life and inscribe me in the black book of death
let it be no
let it be so now
ecstatically yes master yes
oh thank you thank you
i can feel the power flowing through me like an electric current rendering me capable of any achievement mental or physical
i could float on air walk on water
he stoops and dabbles his hands in the ring of fire see
i plunge my hands in fire and feel no heat
picks up the gasoline can holds it over his head dousing himself in the contents then hurls it aside corso hey dont be stupid
balkan unhearing admay eloy agla zatel gebal elimi ashtoreth moloch shamash dagon
with a whoosh he himself catches fire
flames play over his ecstatic figure its miraculous
i feel nothing nothing at all
he emits another triumphant laugh that soars up the scale until it becomes a high pitched scream of agony
he starts to caper around slapping at his clothes his face his hair
corso has regained his feet
he takes the automatic from his pocket and sends it slithering across the floor and through the ring of flames
corso here you idiot
he retreats up the steps with horror written on his face
the girl has risen to her feet
he takes her hand and with a last backward glance hustles her outside
balkans wild screams reverberate around the walls as corso and the girl hurry across the courtyard
they are standing beside the mercedes
smoke and tongues of flame are issuing from the arrow slits of balkans tower
his screams rise in a crescendo
then a gunshot cuts them off like a knife
corso he really thought it would work
girl he wasnt to know it wouldnt
corso stares at her momentarily puzzled then at the blazing castle then back at her you didnt do anything to help him greeneyes not this time
girl im your guardian angel remember
she lays her palm against his cheek then crooks her hand around the nape of his neck and draws his face toward hers kisses him tenderly on the lips
corso returns her kiss
he folds her in his arms and holds her close
the fiery glow dances over their entwined figures
the castle is now ablaze
the flames have spread from balkans tower to the rest of the building
smoke and flames are now belching from it
the sky overhead is tinged with crimson
paris hotel room
corsos hair damp from the shower and a towel around his waist is halfway through shaving when theres a knock on the bathroom door
one cheek daubed with foam he opens it to find himself confronted by the floor waiter check pad and ballpoint in hand waiter bonjour msieur
votre petit djeuner
taking the pad he emerges into the bedroom and scribbles his signature then stops short theres a breakfast cart in the middle of the room but the bed is empty
no sign of the girl or her clothes
corso where is she
corso madame ou elle est
waiter je ne ai pas vue msieur
he makes for the door and exits
corso catches hold of the door just as its closing puts his head out into the corridor looks right and left
no one in sight but the floor waiter who casts a puzzled glance over his shoulder as he walks off
corso now dressed but unshaven hurries over to the reception desk where gruber is on duty
gruber greets him with an almost imperceptible inclination of the head
gruber good morning mr
corso morning gruber
the young lady i came with have you seen her
gruber yea sir
she went out not long ago
he reaches behind him and produces a folded message slip from one of the pigeonholes she asked me to give you this
he hands the slip to corso who opens it
with him we read see you around maybe
and below that ps
the th engraving was a forgery
corsos footsteps echo as he walks along one of toledos narrow medieval streets
the steel framed glasses with the cracked lens have been replaced by a new pair with gold frames
hes wearing a smart new overcoat and has a new leather bag slung from his shoulder
he rounds a corner and heads down the deserted alleyway we saw in an earlier scene
no scaffolding just sandblasted walls and freshly painted window frames and grilles
he reaches the doorway leading to the inner courtyard hears a womans strident cries bumps into the boy who comes running out as before
corso crosses the courtyard to the steps that led down to the cenizas workshop
he stops short and stares
the old door hermanos ceniza restauracion de libros has been taken off its hinges and propped on its side against the basement wall
the display window is just a gaping hole the window frame has been ripped out exposing the masonry surrounding it
the whirr of a power tool can be heard
corso looking puzzled descends the steps
he pauses in the doorway and surveys the interior
the hand press has disappeared and the floor is littered with debris
pale rectangular patches on the grey walls indicate where counters and cabinets have been ripped out
two spanish workmen are busy detaching an old cabinet from the wall with an electric screwdriver
he has to repeat himself before they interrupt their activities
st workman senor
corso los hermanos ceniza
st workman los ceniza
glances at the nd workman estan muertos
corso como muertos
st workman oh hace anos anos
nd workman ingles
nd workman ah
they dead many years
corso more and more puzzled but they were here not long ago i spoke with them
the nd workman looks at his colleague shrugs and chuckles as if to convey that corso is crazy like most foreigners
st workman disculpe
he indicates that corso is in the way
utterly disconcerted corso backs up as they manhandle the cabinet away from the wall and tilt it forward prior to laying it face down on the floor
as they do so a dusty piece of paper slides off the top of the cabinet and seesaws to the floor like a falling leaf
instinctively corso stoops and picks it up
he looks at it idly then more closely
his eyes widen
its the ninth engraving the woman riding a seven headed dragon with a castle ablaze in the background
the womans face bears a strong resemblance to that of the girl
corso walks back along the alleyway with the engraving in his hand
his receding figure dwindles to a speck
