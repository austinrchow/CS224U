written by peter atkins original story by peter atkins tony randel st draft may bobbi thomson revised may william morris agency revised june el camino drive revised july beverly hills
ca night is falling in a forgotten part of the city
the street lights are a joke three out of four are dead
only a large moon and some cloud streaked stars illuminate this dark and derelict street
once the hub of an industrial area now the buildings are abandoned the sidewalks choked with litter and debris
stores are boarded up windows are glassless walls are graffitied
at various points several bums warm their hands at trash can fires
as their eyes move following something moving down the street
heard off is the sound of a smooth and powerful engine
down this boulevard of decay and despair drives an incongruously expensive car a range rover
a rich kid is going shopping
the car cruises the ruins until it pulls up outside the only open store on the block
a dim light bulb shines within the only indicator that the store is still trading
its windows are grimy its door defaced
above the door barely legible through the accrued dirt of city years a sign carduccis antiques and curios
the side door opens helped on its way by the kick of an expensive leather boot and jp monroe steps out
jp is rich handsome and spoiled
his hair is slick with designer grease his slim frame is wrapped in a leather jacket
for a moment he surveys the store and casts contemptuous glances up and down the ruined street
he shows no anxiety at being in this twilight part of town
cocooned in the confidence of wealth hes never felt threatened in his life
satisfied hes in the right place he walks confidently through the doorway
the store itself looks like an antique old wood panelling and shelving victorian display cases and faded wallpaper
it is grimy dusty and dimly lit and apparently unattended
it is packed with merchandise shelves and aisles overflow onto the floor making the place a maze to walk through
the stock is a strange surreal mix
discarded items from s america norge fridges toasters frankie lymon albums share space with older items framed pictures victorian automata wax dolls and a specialty of the store
items of punishment stocks iron boots chastity belts whips
could that really be an electric chair glimpsed in the shadowed back of the room
he wanders through the merchandise casting appraising glances at some items
some he even runs his hands over grimacing at the dust and grime they leave on his fingers
but his manner suggests he is looking for something specific
near the rooms center is an old hoarding from the dead days of vaudeville and travelling shows
it is tall and broad and is leaning against something behind it
which is colorfully and garishly decorated and full of hyperbolic come ons to long dead punters as he moves the hoarding aside
revealed is a six foot tall black rectangular pillar covered in beautifully detailed d carvings all in the same matt black finish as the pillar itself
the pillar is extremely bizarre as if a new york avant garde sculptor has interpreted a totem pole for jaded modern tastes
the carvings are of dead rats copulating skeletons filigree patterned boxes and faces
one of these faces recognizable to the audience but not to jp is the ossified visage of pinhead the demon from the first two hellraiser pictures
as he leans in to study this face already fascinated by its calm cruelty and promise of dark wisdom
a voice off startles him
you want it
jp whirls round in shock
a bum is standing close to him
he has long matted black hair and a similarly greasy beard
his eyes are a piercing excited blue
otherwise he is indistinguishable from those we saw on the street outside ragged tatty clothes features blackened with grime
as he glances round the store and past the bum to the door beyond has this character just wandered in from the street
is it yours
the bum smiles shaking his head knowingly
jp nods still a little uncertain
how much do you want for it
whatever you think its worth
jp digs a hand into his back pocket and pulls out a wad of cash
without counting or checking he proffers it
the bums hand flies out and siezes jps pressing the money between their palms making the exchange into a handclasp
in the background out of focus is pinheads face on the pillar
the focus switches so that the hands in foreground blur and pinheads frozen face becomes sharp as if he is silently watching this deal take place
the bums hand moves away with the money as we blackness
its a mystery to me
smash cut to full frame video image image of joanne summerskill standing and looking directly into camera as if we are watching a tv broadcast
in shot behind her is a quiet hospital emergency room no patients no staff just beds and intensive care equipment
joanne or joey as she prefers to be called is years old an attractive and clever brunette with a quiet sadness in her eyes that she usually manages to keep
dressed in the stylish but sedate garb of a tv newsperson she holds a microphone marked with the logo of her station w qqy
her direct address to the unseen tv camera continues
most nights this inner city emergency room would be a chaos of blood and panic and grace under pressure
but tonight as you see its like death took a holiday
its a mystery to me
a mystery how those assholes at assignments knew it
this is joey summerskill for w qqy
really really pissed off
despite the nature of her last few words joey has ironically kept up the manner and delivery of a newscaster
now she breaks mood looks away from the camera and with a dismissive wave of the hand begins to walk out of shot
ah break it down doc
its a bust
to reveal that we are not watching a broadcast at all but are in the er in real time
as well as joey the room contains her cameraman doc fisher and an er nurse
doc a year old with a weight problem a nicotine addiction and a cynical attitude lowers a shoulder mounted video camera and watches joey walk to a water cooler against
his expression is a mix of exasperation and sympathy
the nurse is a middle aged woman of asian ancestry
she has a puzzled expression as she addresses doc
she can talk like this on television
she can say this thing
doc replies but keeps his eyes on joey as he crosses to her
no sweat sweetheart
its for the european satellite
joey rein it in kid
they couldntve known
joey sucks angrily at water from a paper cup and then crushes and bins the cup like an act of revenge
but its just so
neat isnt it
the first gig that isnt cute kids or diet gurus and its taken away from me
yeah well like you said its a mystery
but thats all it is
what you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to
doc is interrupted by the ringing of a cell phone he has holstered at his waist
he picks it up
th and cedar
listen joeys here
martins already there
youve got ambulances to beat
the line goes dead
doc looks at joey
she heard it all
he shrugs apologetically
better hurry doc
a real story
with a real reporter
look you wanna ride
i can go by your place
youd lose the money shots
ill catch a bus
or a cab
dont worry about it
and lighten up
story of your life could be right round the corner
that is the story of my life
with a rueful smile joey watches doc leave
joey and the nurse exchange glances joeys impassive but vaguely friendly the nurses a little disapproving if the cameras gone what the hell are you still doing here
joey makes her solitary way along a medium length corridor that has two sets of double swing doors at either end one set giving on to the er the other
toward an exit
joey is heading for the latter her mood sad and defeated
the doors burst open from the other side
the mood is suddenly fast and urgent as a gurney is wheeled rapidly through the doors
two paramedics both male both about joeys age are pushing the gurney at a run and talking rapidly to each other
they completely ignore joey and also ignore the teenage girl who is running beside the gurney
the girl terri is or
she is a pale faced blonde dressed as if for a desperately seeking susan party and is keeping up a stream of chatter as if rehearsing excuses
as joey flattens herself against the corridor wall to let them pass it is neither the paramedics nor terri that get her attention
it is the boy on the gurney
the teenage boy lies flat on his back semi conscious his eyelids fluttering his breathing shallow
horribly shockingly dangling from his face and body are long heavy chains that drag and rattle along the corridor floor
there are at least sixteen of them and they seem firmly buried in his skin
the dialogue as the gurney is rushed to the er doors is rapid fire and overlapped the paramedics responding only to each other and ignoring the two girls comments and
it wasnt my fault
it wasnt my fault
milligram iv valium stat
how the fuck did this happen
it was outside
i wasnt even with him
you ever see anything like this before
he must have stolen it
whats going on
five times a fucking day
once the gurney has passed her joey runs along behind it
it was off the statue
in the club
what happened to him
think theyll get him back
its nothing to do with me
worst case of status ive seen
even money at best
the foot of the gurney slams into the er doors and the paramedics slide it rapidly through
im a reporter
tell me where he was
the nurse and a middle aged doctor are seen through the doors preparing emergency equipment
the doctor already has fibrillator pads in his hands
the paramedics follow the gurney through and turning rapidly push the doors closed from the inside
joey and terri are alone excluded from the er activity
joey turns to speak but terri is already halfway to the other doors
joey runs after her
hold on please
i need talk to you
over her shoulder its nothing to do with me
i wasnt even with him
joey catches up with her a couple of yards short of the doors
she grabs at her arm to slow her down
terri turns snatching her arm away in a sudden moment of fierce anger
she backs toward the doors making gestures of dismissal and denial with her hands
i told you
its not my problem
i was just there
under the underground
can i like go now
under the underground
suddenly the conversation is interrupted by a shatteringly loud scream agonized and terrified coming from the er
both girls freeze but then their reactions are very different joey turns instantly and runs back toward the er
terri watches her for a beat and then heads through the other doors
the scream continues a howling horrible sound
joey reaches the er doors and throws them open
and freezes in terrified shock
is on the floor as if flung there by some powerful force
the fibrillator pads are still in his hands and his expression is awe struck and disbelieving
is cowering behind a mobile tray of surgical instruments muttering to herself and making the gesture of the cross
are flattened against the far wall terror on their faces
the boy is on the emergency table
its him thats screaming
his body is arched tight in shock eyes and mouth wide open
hes wired up to an ecg and the monitor shows a heartbeat that should be measured on the richter scale
the chains all still connected to his face and his body are rigid and tight being pulled straight up into the air as if tugged taut by invisible hands
the boys skin is stretched and pulled at those points where the chains are connected to him and it seems horribly possible that his flesh will burst if the pressure
the scene is held for a terrible frozen moment
then suddenly the chains drop the scream stops and the boys body slumps
there is a massive electrical surge
the ecg flat lines before it and the other monitors go haywire sparking and spluttering
the lights in the room flicker and strobe
the fibrillator pads arc angrily
the doctor flings them away
electric energy seems to run along the slumped chains and they disappear as if dissolved in some impossible electric meltdown
lighting and machinery return to normal ecg still flat lining and the medical staff stare thunder struck at the dead boy
for the first time the other people in the er become aware of joeys presence in the doorway
get her out of here
the nurse heads for the doors
joey is already backing away
as joey backs away an expression of numbed shock on her face
the doors close over blocking her out
close on flickering neon light in the bus cabin
glancing at the light from her seat
the bus is almost deserted
three other passengers a punk a bag lady and a wino are spread out around the interior
all seem lost in worlds of their own but their vacant alienated stares highlight joeys isolation and tension
fear has entered her life
the bus moves through the neon lit loneliness of downtown streets
her face lit by reflected store signs and street lights is lost and distant as if she is submerged in some dream sea of memory and sadness
a wall of tv monitors each monitor showing joey sitting on a couch with a painfully thin older woman brittany vertue
brittanys probably but her face is as tight and smooth as surgery can make it
she is dressed in the standard uniform of the health avatar brightly colored leotard over black tights
joey has a big paperback book beyond hunger the brittany vertue guide to holistic dieting which she holds to camera
she smiles and turning to face brittany crosses her legs
the image freezes
joey crosses her legs again
this is what i mean
your technique is all wrong
joey in real time is sitting in an easy chair in the editing suite looking at the wall of monitors
brad a techie in his late twenties and doc fisher are in swivel chairs immediately in front of the video console
all three are drinking coffee
doc is smoking a cigarette
guardedly what do you mean
i mean hardly any thigh
im telling you joey shorter skirt more lift on the leg cross
and youre made
doc chuckles in a half friendly half sleazy way
what you think im kidding
i guarantee it
an inch more flank
boys upstairs get hot
bingo youre an anchor woman
to herself jesus christ
ah give her a break
doc leans over and stops the tape
to doc whats with you
he swivels his chair round to face joey
im just trying to help you hit a home run here
well you just struck out
it may be a surprise to you brad but i want to do it the right way
not tight skirts
like last nights doozie
i know what i saw
and i believe what you say
but this is tv
no pictures no story
yeah too bad i had to go and
and cover something on planet earth
see you gotta remember joey this is a local station
as in local to this galaxy
joey slams her coffee mug down and stands up
theres a story out there
jumping in warningly not on station time
not on station time
brad watches her leave with a half smile on his face then turns to doc
lot of attitude there doc
he starts up the video tape again and on the monitors joey once again crosses her legs on the couch
but great legs
close on a screaming male face twisted as in pain or fury
pull back rapidly to reveal the face belongs to the lead singer of thanatos
he is on a nightclub stage with the rest of the band all of them dressed in that shit poor white trash on dope look favored by all such rich
young businessmen with guitars
a tatty banner across the back of the stage proclaims under the scream ends replaced with the roaring thunder of drums and guitars as thanatos kick into some thrash metal
the dance floor of the club is packed with kids dancing to the incredibly fast incredibly loud music
many of the kids favor the same look as the band but its not exclusive college types are there too along with some male and female sporting the glitz meets
sleaze look of terri
the club itself is of course dimly lit and the basic decor is black
where it is distinguished from hundreds of others is in the bizarre sculptures and pieces of artwork that hang from the ceiling and walls all in tones of black silver
and gray a headless armless torso wrapped in barbed wire
a pair of male and female heads
bonsai like trees grow out of every orifice eye sockets nostrils ears and mouths
a human arm with the skin and flesh of its upper half peeled open and pinned out to reveal inside instead of bone and sinew an entire miniature metropolis beautifully
a black bird cage containing a fetal skeleton
kids also crowd the bar and the tables on the outskirts of the dance floor
it is a hot sweaty faintly aggressive atmosphere people jostling for position shouting to be heard etc etc
the camera finds joey incongruous by dress and demeanor pushing her way among the crowd
the music is too loud and overpowering to hear joeys voice but it is clear as she moves through the confines of the club that she is approaching various people
and enquiring after terri
shake their heads and shrug
stares blankly and blinks
giggle purse their lips shake their heads
catches sight of a blonde figure moving across the dance floor and pushes through the crowd to follow
she taps the figures arm but as it turns she realizes it is a man some s revivalist glitter rocker
he looks quizzically at her
joeys mouth moves and this time she seems to get some response
the glitter rocker mouths a name
joey cant hear him
she hands him a business card and a pen
he scrawls a name on the back of the card and joey nods her thanks as he moves on
as joey reads the name terri on it
she flips the card to reveal her name and number and writes terri please call
as joey pushes to the counter and hands the card to a barman who looks at it nods and puts it beneath the counter
as joey makes her way out
camera moves into the tightly packed throng on the dance floor making its way slowly toward the previously unseen center
the crowd parts slightly to reveal in the direct center of the floor the tall black pillar from the opening sequence
the pillar is mounted on a plinth and spins as the clientele dance around it
it seems very in keeping with the decor of the club but even so it is a strong unsettling presence
the pillar has been mounted upside down so that it looks even odder than our first glimpse of it
near the bottom the inverted face of pinhead black and frozen can be seen
the camera begins to spin around the pillar in contrary motion to the pillars own movement and as it does so draws closer and closer making for a disorienting vertiginous
as this happens the raucous sound of the band thanatos begins to fade into a whirl of echo and to be replaced by a whirring spinning sound which we only
recognize fully as we the screen is filled with dense jungle foliage
the chugging spinning sound is now identifiable as the sound of helicopter blades one element of a sound montage conveying the sense and feel of a jungle war helicopters in
flight machine gun fire distant explosions confused shouts and cries
a pov camera pushes its way through the lush humid greenery
the camera seems to be searching for something glancing this way and that shoving leaves and tall grass aside
voices begin to emerge clearly from the sound mass off screen as if the unseen seeker is getting nearer to his or her goal
off call for a medi vac
off dont die man
dont fucking die
the dialogue prompts a more furious effort on the part of the pov camera
pushing frantically through the obscuring foliage it finally gains a clearer view and stops looking ahead
in a tiny clearing ten feet from the camera still partially obscured by the jungle two camouflage clad soldiers lean over the prone body of a third
it is unclear due to distance but there is a lot of blood on the soldiers body and uniform
a new sound joins the sound montage a persistent rhythmic ringing sound
the other elements die away until only this is left and we recognize it as the sound of a telephone as we joey jerks upright in bed as the ringing
confused and disoriented her eyes fly around her darkened bedroom as if shes trying to understand where she is and what is happening
finally she registers the phone and leans toward her bedside table to pick it up
favoring the luminous display of an alarm clock next to the phone
its warm green figures show the time is
this better be birth marriage or death
as she picks up the handset and puts it to her ear
on phone uh
yeah who is this
left me a card
at the club
joey swings out of bed to sit on the edge much more alert now
well what do you want
i want to talk to you
now listen dont hang up ok
we met at the hospital last night
look ill make a deal with you
my boyfriend threw me out right
ill trade you
you give me couch space
ill give you talk
joey cant resist another glance at the clock
surprised at joeys surprise
bit of a culture clash here of course tonight
is that a problem
like if youve got a guy there or something
i was having bad dreams anyway
close on the front door of the apartment as it opens to reveal terri leaning against the doorframe
clad identically to how we last saw her terri clutches a well stuffed leather bag containing all her worldly possessions
howre you doing
not waiting for either reply or invitation she moves forward
as terri walks past the dressing gowned joey and heads straight for joeys sofa and sprawls on it laying her bag on the floor beside her
you got anything to drink
joey closes the door raised eyebrows registering her slight disapproval at terris cavalier attitude
her voice however is polite
i put some decaf on
make yourself comfortable
joey walks past terri and through to her kitchen from where we hear the sound of coffee being poured
terri looks around at joeys room
the large and spacious room suggests that even if joey is dissatisfied with her job shes at least being paid enough to make it bearable
the room is very ordered very neat but stops short of being prissy
a very large picture window takes up all of one wall
at the moment of course the drapes are closed
another wall is taken up by a huge shelf unit packed with books videos and cds
joeys obsession with getting the whole story seems to be true of her personal life as well as her professional
having finished her quick examination she calls out
what was your bad dream
joey re enters carrying two mugs of coffee
you said you were having a bad dream
she hands one coffee to terri and sits opposite her
well ive been having it for years
its not a nightmare or anything
its well i know what it is
what is it
why are you so interested
no its ok
its my father
sympathetic knowing oh right
did he used to
nothing like that
no he died before i was born
he died in vietnam
i never knew him
never met him
we dont even know the details
i dream of battlefields
of trying to find out
i mean its not like great about your dad or anything
its just i dont dream
maybe itd help if i slept sometime
no so its always neat for me to hear about dreams
its like everybody has another world except me
you know what i mean
i know what youre saying but
youve never had a dream
no you know you do
what you mean is you dont remember them
all i know is this is it for me
just me my bag and a series of shithead boyfriends
itd be good to see something else
have a nighttime life
be somebody different
terri pauses then smiles like shes just realized something
this is great isnt it
just girls talking
like having a conversation
you got a cigarette
joey waits letting herself catch up with terris good natured but marginally strung out personality
she looks around the room as if trying to remember where there are cigarettes
wait a minute
joey crosses to the big shelf unit and pulls out a concealed pack of cigarettes a zippo lighter and an ashtray from behind a shelf of videos
we notice that the videos are the world at war volumes thru
she brings the smokes to terri
you gonna have one
im trying to quit
oh go on
you think youre going to live forever
she smiles and proffers the pack to joey who shrugs smiles and takes one
terri picks up the zippo and sparks it
a huge flame leaps out of the lighter producing an instant of terror from terri
joey pulls the lighter back from terri and closes the lid extinguishing the flame
terri draws a book of matches from her pocket shakily attempts to light her cigarette
it was my fathers
its just someone burned me once
joey takes the book of matches from terris hands and lights both cigarettes
terri takes a long fearful look at the burning flame and then takes a deep calming drag of her cigarette
wanna know how i look at it
way i see it is
you give up right
three days later you get hit by a fucking truck and you know you just know that your last thought as you go under those wheelsd be jesus h
christ i coulda smoked another three packs
she lays the book of matches down
joeys eyes go to them
black letters on the dark grey cover under the underground
terris eyes flick to the match book and her mood changes becoming subdued and a little sullen
you wanna talk about that stuff
yes i do
terri something awful happened to that boy
i have to find out what it was
but i dont know anything
i just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street
did you know him
id seen him in there a few times before
he was just a punk
id never like danced with him or anything
anyway he was a thief
he mustve taken it from the statue
he was lying there in the street moaning
but he pointed at it wait a minute
he was already
when you found him
thats what im saying
and it was lying next to him
and he pointed at it before he passed out and
where did the chains come from
thats what im trying to tell you
terri rummages in her bag getting hold of something
he said they came out of this
she holds her hand out and the camera tracks in to meet it
resting on her palm is a black cube about inches square
it has the same matt black carbonized look as the pillar and is recognizable as one of the carvings we saw on it
there is fine filigree pattern work over each of its surfaces and to audiences familiar with the hellraiser movies the box is recognizable despite its black coating it is the
lament configuration the puzzle box that opens the doors to hell
there is a stubby shard of material protruding from one side of the box presumably where the boy from er had broken it off the pillar
camera favors this jagged shard as we very close on its upper left section
we are looking at a hole in the pillar that matches the pattern of the shard on the box
the club is empty
the dim lighting of working hours has been replaced with the sickly gleam of one or two fluorescent tubes and the club has that eerie not quite right look that
all night places have when subjected to a harsher light
two workers are in the final stages of clearing the nights debris emptying trash into big black plastic bags wiping down tables and bars etc
work completed they head to the main exit
one of them hits the light switches so that the fluorescent clarity is again replaced by the more appropriate dim lighting
the other shouts across the apparently deserted club
all done mr
they stand a second but no response comes
the first turns to the second and shrugs
mouthing silently ass hole
his co worker grins and they let themselves out
another door opens into the club and jp monroe the clubs owner and the man we saw buy the pillar walks into the main room of the club from his
private room at the back
jp walks out into the shadowed darkness of his small kingdom
he describes a circle around the dance floor throwing glances at his odd sculptures and finally walks into the center of the room to stand before the pride of his
collection the pillar
the pillar of course is stationary at this time though it is still mounted upside down
jp smiles possessively at the pillar and then registers the mutilation where the box has been ripped away
he leans in closer to stare at the hole
suddenly jarringly there is a quiet but distinct squeak that seems to come from within the hole
jp starts back a little a small expression of anxiety on his normally supercilious face
he glances to right and left gets a grip and leans forward again
as again the noise comes
is it a squeak or is it the creaking shifting of hidden machinery hidden chains
jps hand moves tentatively into shot approaching the hole
slowly slowly it reaches wrist deep into the blackness
very close on jps face quizzical enquiring
and suddenly contorted in pain
as jps hand whips out of the hole shaking in shock and pain
a rat is hanging on to one of jps fingers its sharp teeth buried in the flesh
jp swings his arm violently through the air dislodging the rat with the force of his swing
a spray of blood is seen to come from jps wounded finger
as it lands heavily in a shadowed corner of the club and scurries away deeper into the darkness squeaking furiously
as he looks down at his finger face snarling
son of a
blood seeps from the tiny teeth marks
jps voice is cut off by a strange sizzling noise heard off
jps face moves up to look at the pillar
a look of awe and shock crosses his face
some small drops of blood stand out bright red on the blackness of the pillar
the sizzling noise is coming from them
suddenly the drops draw together magically into one large ruby of blood already larger than possibility would allow
then it gets wierder the blood suddenly dissipates into six or seven little rivulets that begin to run down the pillar
the streams of blood dont simply fall straight
they seem to follow some pre gouged pattern running down the pillar tracing the blackened organic contours of the carvings
they all culminate at the point of pinheads chin and then separate again running over his frozen black face along the carved scar lines that make a matrix across his
when every canal line on the demons face is filled neatly with blood a blue light seems to glow from within the pillar through pinheads face giving it temporarily the
blue tone he had enjoyed in un life
close on his awe struck face bathed in reflected blue light
as gradually the blueness subsides again the visible blood vanishing with it leaving the same frozen implacable blackness as before but charged now with a waiting power
off oh my god
a frying pan sits atop a burner
it contains the ugliest mess of scrambled eggs you have ever seen
or perhaps its an omelette
there are other ingredients in there but theyre burnt so black theyre unrecognizable
at least half of the mixture lies all over the stove top instead of in the pan
off did i sleep through an earthquake
showing the chaos all around the kitchen spilled flour on work surfaces egg shells on the linoleum a knocked over glass of orange juice the juice soaking into a piece
of kitchen roll coffee as black and thick as a mix of indian ink and molasses
joey in her dressing gown stands in the doorway with a shocked expression on her face
terri in an oversized mans shirt stands by the stove holding a fish slice and smiling nervously
i figured id make breakfast
thats nice of you terri
can i ask
is it always this
i dont know yet
kitchen virgin thats me
joey nods slowly crossing to a cabinet and taking out some instant coffee
ill boil some water
ill do it
no thats ok
i like to
i love boiling water
its a specialty of mine
why dont you go watch cartoons
joey watches terri walk out of the kitchen sighs in relief and grabs the kettle
joey sits drinking her coffee as terri walks round the room with hers
this is great
and its yours
you like own it
the bank owns it
but im working on it
jeez ive never owned anything
i havent even had a room of my own since i was fifteen years old
how have you
terri walks past joeys tv set sound down cartoons playing
the box is on top of the tv
in the warm light of morning it seems innocuous and harmless like just another ornament
as terri walks on pausing by the shelves of books
you read all these
i buy them to impress people
of course ive read them
i read a book once
it was like all these people discovering who they used to be
you know like reincarnation
it was really good
you ever read that
i dont think so
but its a fascinating subject
but terri has already moved on
she is by the big picture window
the drapes are now open
look at this
joey stands and walks to join terri
actually im pretty familiar with the view
joeys apartment is on a high floor and her window overlooks many lower buildings giving a view of the city beyond
off but it is good
you know over to the left you can
looking to right and pointing whos that
on the flat roof of a nearby building a retarded teenage boy sits motionless in an old rusty deck chair next to a small jerry built pigeon coop
its door is open and it is empty
the boy is some distance from the girls but his solitude his stillness and the empty coop beside him lend the scene an atmosphere of sadness and loss
as joey tells his story we intercut between the pov of the roof and the girls at the window
i dont know his name
i saw the whole story
a wounded bird was on his roof
i could hear its cries from here
he went straight to it
id be frozen between pity and fear
but he wasnt
its pain spoke directly to him
he picked it up
and it got better
everyday hed watch the pigeon
everyday the pigeon would watch him
i saw him learn
learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete
and one day just as afternoon became evening he leaned over opened the cage and walked away
didnt look back
but he heard the sound of its wings
and he still sits there
maybe he thinks itll come back
he knows it wont
it was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him doesnt yet
he shouldve kept it
itd live longer
its dangerous out there
people get hurt
as she realizes she has a wounded pigeon of her own
i wasnt talking about
do you want to stay
you want to stay here for a while
terri shrugs gives a nervous smile
joey crosses to the tv picks up the box and weighs it in her hand
its a done deal
but look you have to help me
ive got to solve this thing
ive got to know whats going on
terri follows across the room and sits on the sofa
but i dont know whats going on
but you know more than i do
you know something about this box
something about a statue
i found it
i knew held like it and i figured
wait a minute
my last boyfriend
he like owns the club
you were there
he bought the statue
that you found
what do you mean you found it
i was downtown looking for a
a guy i know
anyway there was this store
like real old
lotsa weird shit in there
i saw this statue
i knew hed love it
youve seen the club
would you know this store again
its saturday morning
lets go shopping
joeys mazda drives down the street
the daylight street is still creepy but in a different way no bums no trash can fires nothing
it has the feel of a ghost town as if nothing has breathed here for years
joey at the wheel has a disbelieving look on her face
terri smoking flicks ash through her wound down window
are you sure this is the street
happening isnt it
what on earth were you doing down here
an evasive silence
buying some drugs alright
for somebody else alright
not for me
i dont do that shit anymore
then you shouldnt even be around it
you know its
joey brings the car to a halt outside the antique store
terri scrambles out of the passenger door
i told you it was here
as she looks at terri from behind her face worried for her new and screwed up friend
joey and terri enter the store
the store is different its selection of merchandise reduced
the s and s junk hardware is still there along with some of the more mundane victoriana but it seems more normal none of the odd items of punishment memorabilia
also because it is daylight the store seems merely old interesting and musty not creepy or odd
there seems to be no one in attendance
as they walk through the store
off can i help
the voice startles the girls and they jump around to face the counter as mama carducci moves into view from beneath it
mama an ancient and slightly eccentric italian american woman eyes the girls with the suspicion of somebody who hasnt had a customer in decades
not aggressive just surprised
we were wondering
terri show her the box
terri removes the box from her purse and holds it up
not for my customers
have you tried
no you dont understand
were not selling it
it came from here
everything sold as is
i took back everything bought on a whim id have no business
lady will you shut the fuck up and give her a break
a sudden silence
both mama and joey stare at terri in surprise
mama looks back at joey
quite a mouth
so whats the problem
you tell me
you i like
terri raises her eyes to heaven
this came off a
we wondered if you knew anything about the piece
about where it came from
mama squints at the box as if trying to recognize it
i sold that
mamas eyes scan the store
im glad its gone
made the store feel strange
whod make such a thing
but can you tell us anything about it
it was part of a job lot
some loony bin they shut down
what else came with it
anything still here
just papers photos
stuff nobodyd ever want
can we see
you gonna buy
i dont know
right at the back there
id do you a good price
joey and terri approach an old shelf unit along the rear wall
a shaft of sunlight throws a square of light on the wooden floor a few yards in front of the shelves
joey takes up a big bulging manilla folder from the shelves and begins to look through it
terri check out the other folder
terri still holding her purse and the box looks around for somewhere to put them
all the shelves are full
she lays them on the floor in the square of sunlight and joins joey at the shelves grabbing up the second folder
what am i looking for
terri opens up the folder and begins to pace the floor as she flicks through the contents
youre gonna pay her for this shit
its like fucking business papers for gods sake
bored terri wanders off to lean against another shelf unit
as she flicks through the contents
terris dismissive summary seems justified
all joey sees are obscure and meaningless case notes and paperwork
each item is letter headed the channard institute
joeys hand reaches a large envelope
scrawled in hand across it is the phrase dr
channard personal papers
joey draws the contents out and begins to sift through them
the first item is a dusty black and white photograph of an officer in english army uniform circa
joey blows the dust from the photo
which sits on the floor in the shaft of sunlight the dust from the photo settling next to it
the next photo is that of a beautiful young woman
joey flips it over
gummed on the back is a type written slip that says the sounds of the girls flicking through papers is heard off and then fades as something strange begins to
suddenly the dust around the box begins to move as if blown by an invisible wind
it is drawn up so that it forms an impossible spiral in the air
spinning like a miniature hurricane it hovers over the box
the sunlight seems to grow brighter
is it just reflections on the metalwork designs or is the box itself glowing and shining
as her eyes flick back and forth as she scans
joey turns another item and her face registers surprise at what she is seeing
the next item in the folder is a xerox sheet a reproduction of what appears to be an ancient document
it is a diagram like a designers drawing or plan
and it is of the box seen from various angles
as she realizes what she is looking at
joey turns folder in hand to look at the box on the floor and compare it to the diagram
the miniature tornado of spiralling dust suddenly disappears inside the apparently sealed box as if sucked down into it
as if on cue the shaft of sunlight disappears behind a cloud as the last particle of dust disappears into the box
joey mouth open in shock lets the folder drop from her hand
the sound of its splayed contents hitting the floor alerts terri who walks back round from the other shelf unit
terri looks at the dropped contents and then up at joey
still staring at box help me pick em up terri
i think the lady just made a sale
joey is sitting behind a desk
she has a phone in one hand and a pen in the other
spread out over the desk are various documents the photo of kirsty the diagram of the box type written transcripts etc and a scratch pad on which joey has scrawled
joey is in mid conversation on the phone
no its important that i speak to
a beat put
joey slams the phone down
she stares at the papers at the scratch pad takes a deep breath and punches out a number on the phone
this time joeys voice is different
and listen good
im the station manager at w qqy
for the last half hour youve been dicking around with my assistant
let me tell you something
with or without your co operation we are making this expose
i assume youre smart enough to guess which version is going to make you look good
now if you cant put one hand on that cassette and the other on a fedex mans butt within thirty seconds then you damn well better put me through to
somebody who can
a pause while somebody jumps through hoops at the other end
joeys voice transmogrifies again now its a seductive persuasive purr
how nice of you to take my call
i understand youre in charge of video archive from the channard institute
another night in under the underground kids dance
customers jostle at the bar
couples neck in shadowed corners
loud metal music blasts out from speakers next to the various sculptures on the walls and ceiling
the center of the dance floor is packed
the pillar is missing
sitting alone at a bar stool though surrounded by tightly packed customers is sandy a very pretty teenage girl
she is the same basic type as terri blonde frail young
too young in fact to be legally in a club like this
sandy stares at her empty glass and stares at it wistfully enough to suggest she doesnt have the money to get it refilled
she is trying to keep up a cool impassive face but her eyes betray her basically vulnerable character
sitting at the opposite end of the bar his eye line confirming he is looking at sandy is jp monroe
the bar stool beside jp is occupied by a teenage boy who has his back to the bar and is talking to a group of his friends
jp has a speculative predatory look on his face
without shifting his gaze he raises his hand and within seconds the barman is leaning over to hear his request
close on sandy as a full glass is placed in front of her
laid alongside the glass is a beautiful long stemmed red rose
sandy looks surprised at the drink and then smiles in delight at the rose
she raises her eyes and looks across the bar
jp returns the smile
he turns to the boy beside him and murmurs something unheard
the boy glances round as if ready to argue with whoever is speaking to him
on recognizing jp however he vacates the seat without an argument and stands to join his friends
jp looks back across the bar at sandy and gestures at the empty stool beside him an attractive welcoming smile on his face
sandy gets up and carrying the drink and the rose makes her way across to sit beside jp
the deafening music playing in the club means that they have to lean in close to hear each other speak
youre jp monroe right
and this is your club
i really love it here
thank you for the drink
and the rose
you won it
its a prize
you see everyday i have my friend john here bring
i thought he was called rick
hes a barman
do you mind if i continue
everyday i have my friend rick here bring a newly cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar
and i award it to a woman of exceptional beauty
oh come on
therere lots of girls here who look better than
dont do that
dont put yourself down
if you have a quality be proud of it
while talking and without taking his eyes off sandy jp gestures at the barman and their glasses
let it define you
whatever it is
most of the roses die behind the bar
this is the first ive given out for nearly a month
two full glasses join the still half full ones on the bar
now there are six empty glasses on the bar and two half full ones
except theyre not there
the two bar stools are empty
the music off from the club is dull and muffled
jp s private room is the size and shares the general appearance of an expensive studio apartment
his room looks like an annex to his club black walls black fittings artworks of elegant cruelty show that jps taste for the bizarre is not just professional
camera explores the room as the sound of breathing grows off
now the right way up it stands in a corner of the room
as usual it looks jarring and impressive but it doesnt really seem out of place in jps room
the breathing off becomes mixed with moans and small cries
jp and sandy both naked are on the bed making love
well maybe sandys making love
jps having sex
it is a selfish phallocentric scene concentrating on jps concern only for his own gratification
it may be an erotic sight but its not a pretty one
jp is on top
he has hold of both sandys wrists in one of his hands and his body is working away rhythmically
he is half upright looking down at her
close on jps face his eyes open staring down at sandy
close on sandys face her eyes closed half in pleasure half in shame
close on pinheads face
suddenly horribly the monsters eyes fly open and his frozen face stares down at the lovers
a blue light seems to pulse from within the pillar lending color to pinheads face
pinhead continues to watch the love making until it comes to a climax
as jp groans out his orgasm and collapses forward onto sandys body pinheads eyes close
the blue light disappears and the pillar is just the pillar again
favoring the telephone answering machine its red message light blinking in the darkness of the apartment
heard off is the sound of joey coming in to her apartment doors opening and closing bags being put down footsteps etc
joeys hand comes into frame and presses the message button
as joey waits for her machine and glances around the room for terri
the sofa is empty
joey looks puzzled and is about to call again when the machine kicks in
on ansafone ms
this is dr
your reference material is on its way to you
i very much enjoyed talking to you and i hope that if im ever in town youll do me the honor of sqwaaaaalk joey has her finger on the fast
in your dreams pal
the chipmunk squeal of fallons voice is replaced by the warning beep of a second message
joey lets it play
on ansafone your number from your resume
which was very impressive by the way
my name is sharon leech and you can reach me here at k yzy in monterey area code
sqwaaalk joey stops the tape
to herself shit
why not last week
she glances round at the empty room again troubled by terris absence
she crosses to her bedroom door
joey enters the darkened room and then stops a few feet from the door
terri lit only by the moonlight through the blinds is lying on one side of joeys bed fast asleep
apart from her shoes which she has kicked off she is fully dressed
joey approaches the bed and watches her sleeping friend her face sympathetic affectionate and troubled
joey reaches over takes one of the pillows from the other side of the bed and lays it at the bottom end
she slips off her shoes shrugs off her jacket and delicately carefully climbs on to the other side of the bed laying her head on the pillow she had moved
whispered goodnight terri
jp on his bed in his shorts enjoying a post coital cigarette blows smoke rings at the ceiling and all but ignores sandy
sandy has put some of her clothes back on and is wandering around the room admiring it and chattering
she approaches the pillar
leans in close
and nothing happens
she walks on to look at a painting on one of the walls
its a painstakingly rendered but crudely imagined piece
the kind of crap youd buy in a melrose gallery
perhaps its called biker crucifixion
night time somewhere rural
a hells angel arms outstretched and stripped to the waist is tied to a tree by cruelly tight barbed wire wrapped around his body
at the foot of the tree his biker friends party drink and fuck harleys parked in the distance
the crucified angels eyes are raised to the moon
youve got great taste
this really says it you know
still staring at the ceiling jp pulls a pained face like hes heard this embarrassing shit a hundred times
dont you think
sandy turns to look at jp troubled by his unresponsiveness
do you mind me talking about your stuff
sandy stares at jp
jp stares at the ceiling
if it bothers you just say so
it doesnt bother me
im just not interested
like im not an interesting person
jp blows a smoke ring at the ceiling
sandy walks back across the room to stand at the foot of the bed
and yes fright fans this does put her in front of the pillar though hopefully the blossoming argument will distract audience attention
but you gave me a rose
and tomorrow ill give one to somebody else
who do you think you are
im jp monroe you stupid little bitch
now get the fuck out of my life
i cant fucking believe you you bastard
you get me in here
like you were hog tied or something
look at you
you think youre some god damn prince or something
with your shitty little kingdom out there and all this ugly shi
sandy is waving her arms to illustrate her point and halfway through her last line has turned to indicate the pillar
big scare moment
two blackened arms fly out from the center of the pillar and grab sandys gesturing arms
the blue light burns from within illuminating pinheads face as his eyes open filled with demonic glee and hunger
an impossible wind begins to whistle through the room as if an echoed glimpse of a storm in hell
sandy screams in mortal terror
jp jumps from the bed cigarette falling to the floor
he backs away to the opposite wall face shocked scared shitless
pinhead smiles sardonically
pinheads arms pull sandy tight against the pillar and his face stifling her scream
jp flattened against the far wall watches in horror as sandy held tight against the pillar suffers a horrible death sandys life force is sucked from her
drawn into the pillar
it is a matter of seconds only but in those few seconds her body begins to collapse in on itself turning grey and lifeless
it is made worse by the fact that until the very end sandy keeps struggling writhing in the grasp of the monster
the wind keeps blowing through the room
finally a dry lifeless husk she is dropped to the floor
the blue light fades from within the pillar
the wind disappears
the pillar is again black and stationary
but its contours are different more rounded
it looks more organic as if shifting its raw material into new alignments new configurations
the pillar seems to be in a process of becoming
and the obvious suggestion is that what it is becoming is pinhead
pinheads head arms and torso now protrude from the pillar
they are not completely free and now that the eating of sandy is concluded seem incapable of independent movement but there is plainly a lot more of him than there
even though the blue light has faded pinheads face is noticeably different
it is blue tinged and more fleshy in appearance
capable of movement
who has sunk to the floor staring at the pillar
what did you see
the same as i
you saw the working of the world in miniature
jp shakes his head in denial
but hes already a little more together than he was after all the pillar cant move and hes several yards from it
that had nothing to do with the world
not this one anyway
on the contrary
it has everything to do with the world
and our dreams of how it will succumb to us
you enjoyed the girl
so did i
and thats all
its not the same
what you did
how uncomfortable that word must feel on your lips
there is no good monroe
there is no evil
there is only the flesh and the patterns to which we can submit it
you will help me to
jp shakes his head in furious denial
no no no
no fuckin way
grabbing at his jeans jp heads out of his room
the sun is high
its about noon
like most clubs of its type under the undergrounds exterior is far from prepossessing
its set in an old brick warehouse in a run down section of town
jps range rover pulls up and jp gets out carrying a long slim black bag
he glances round the all but deserted street and enters the club
close on pinheads face in repose back to its statue like state
the sound of the door off opens the monsters eyes
jp enters closing the door behind him
he doesnt look at the pillar
he stays by the door and keeps his eyes on the long black bag he has brought in with him
he unzips it
his manner is that of a man who has made a decision and is not about to listen to contrary argument
off another offering
jp doesnt respond
he draws a double barrelled shotgun from the bag cocks it and loads it
jp turns to face the pillar drawing a bead on pinhead
pinheads expression is wearily amused
that is the gun you used to kill your parents
jp visibly staggers as pinhead lets slip this knowledge
their fortune was so tempting their affection so conditional
what else could you do
he pulls the double trigger
a massive blast resounds around the room but thats about it the ott six is absorbed magically into the pillar
now shall we talk sensibly
jp lets the useless gun fall from his hand
dont flee from yourself
if you have a quality let it define you
it is you
by helping me you will help yourse
what are you talking about
why should i help you
because you want to
youve always wanted to
look at your pictures
look at your sculptures
look at those tawdry representations and then
imagine a world of the body as canvas
the body as clay
your will and mine as the brush and the knife
oh i have such sights to show you
jps eyes are glittering with excited interest
what are you
a dark star rising
i was bound to anothers system by a soul i once possessed
a friend relieved me of that inconvenience
now im free
born again of blood and desire
hey thats what makes the world go round
pinhead raises an amused eyebrow at jps little joke
you see were not so dissimilar
but how in gods name
my god was diamond and black light
and i was his dark pope
all that is changed
a terrible beauty is born
with a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes
jp cruises the room contemplating this
how do we start
it has already begun
many screens fill the frame all of them crackling with snow
joey is alone at the control desk
she has a video tape in her hand and feeds it into the master machine
she looks up at the still ghosting monitors and then presses a few buttons on the console
the snow is replaced by blackness on every monitor with a time code ticking away at the bottom of each screen
lets see what we got here
the blackness on the monitors gives way to multiple images of kirsty the girl in the picture in the antique store
the video image is primitive shot with a non professional camcorder and is a simple medium long shot of kirsty dressed in a simple white smock sitting in a hospital
kirsty addresses the camera directly though occasionally looks up to the side as if speaking to an unseen doctor
intercut through kirstys monologue between a single monitor image the wall of monitors and the watching and listening joey
on video i dont know what the box is
but i know what it does
looks up to side ive said all this before
blinks nods as if listening
looks back to camera i saw it open
i opened it
i saw what came out
i dont know what else to call them
demons live in the box
or come through the box from somewhere else
its a gateway to hell
or the south bronx
smiles ruefully at her own joke
looks up to side as if chastised for kidding around
continues i know you dont believe me
i know what it sounds like
but what else
jesus talk to ronson talk to the other cops
they saw the house
they saw my
kirsty breaks down into sobs
whose expression shows distressed sympathy
she too has lost her father
the video image breaks up into white noise and then comes back in as if the camcorder was turned off for a few moments
when the image returns kirsty is smoking a cigarette to help calm her
on video solving the puzzle means opening the box
opening the box means opening doors
and there are some doors you dont want to open
and it may be metaphorical to you doctor but you havent had some blue faced bastard come at you with hooks and chains
it isnt delusion it isnt psychosis
long drag on the cigarette
maybe not this reality
but there are others
ive seen them
joeys face shows horrified fascination at kirstys story
there is a conviction in the telling which is working on joey
the room is dimly lit
the floor is littered with video boxes and tapes
other tapes are piled on top of the vcr
its like somebody has been viewing constantly for a week and hasnt put anything away
many books are lying on the sofa the table and the floor
some are lying open most are closed
also on the coffee table are three different soft drink cans a half empty cup of coffee and a very full ash tray
terri is standing by the bookshelfs running her eyes and her finger along some titles
now we understand the chaos in the room
terris home alone
shes bored and trying to find something to hold her interest
she looks away from the shelves and walks idly over to the tv
the box is back on top of the tv
terris hand hovers near the on off switch of the tv
then it hesitates and picks up the box instead
terri holds the box and looks at it
her face becomes puzzled and she crosses the room to flick on a light
she wanders back to the tv looking at the box
it looks different
its edges are more sharply defined
the shard where it was broken from the pillar is smaller smoother
the detailed metal work has some color back and is shining
jeez joey musta polished you up some
sometimes i think shes wierder than me
terris voice trails off as she continues to look at the box
she turns it in her hands running her fingers over its filigree surfaces
track in slowly as she cups it in both hands her eyes moving from puzzlement to fascination and concentration
she rubs her thumbs over the designs
tracking in continues
is she going to try and work the puzzle
the phone rings
terri jumps in shock nearly dropping the box
she puts the box back on top of the tv and crosses to the phone
she picks it up
on phone not quite
live and in the flesh
howre you doing babe
what do you want
close on jps face as he speaks into a phone
god always questions
what do i want
i dont want anything
just concerned about you
just checking in
howd you get this number
will you relax
your little girlfriend left a card remember
things are great here
joeys going to get me a job at the tv station
im meeting lotsa new people
its really great
i mean really
because im concerned for you sweetheart
i care about you
i guess i miss you
im sorry we split up
im sorry i
hey it has been known
cmon terri im not that bad a guy
i have regrets
id like to put things right
dont tell me you havent thought about me
of course i have
oh jp you were so horrible
you really hurt me
im a bad person
but i try not to be terri
i really do
and i really miss you
i miss you too
thats so good to hear sweetheart
it really is
you know i
are you alone
look why dont you come over
you know nothing heavy little drink maybe little talk
just see how we both feel
oh i dont
itll be great
close on terris face we can almost see her summon the will power to refuse
i just cant
she slams the phone down quickly before he can persuade her
she takes a couple of deep breaths and walks away from the phone
she looks around
she looks at the books
she looks at the videos
she looks at the table
she looks back at the phone
as it rings again
shakes her head and turns the ansafone on
after two rings the machine responds
ansafone message hi
youve reached joanne summerskill
in spirit at least
please leave a message
on phone hello
summerskill this is sharon leech again from k yzy in monterey
sorry to call so late but i was wondering if you got my other message
look i probably shouldnt say this on tape but what the hell
theres a job here if you want it
late night news reader
we think youd be marvelous
the machine beeps and cuts her off leaving the message light close on terris face disappointed and sad
joey is still at the desk watching the bank of monitors
as kirsty speaks intercut between joey and the monitors
looks to side again
looks back at camera the box
i dont know where it came from
i dont know who made it or why
i only know what it does
looks off to side as if listening
looks back i dont know
it kind of opens itself
your fingers move
it wants to open thats the thing
and it knows when you want to open it
and it helps
and it opens
and then they come
multiple images of kirsty speaking those last few lines
suddenly one and only one of the monitors suffers a white joey glances up at the one ghosting monitor puzzled and then freezes in shock
as on the one monitor a new image suddenly appears a hazy black and white image very grainy like early experimental tv images of a thirtysomething man in early twentieth
century military uniform
the man elliott stares directly out of the monitor screen and just as kirsty finishes her last line the cenobites
he speaks in an english accent
on monitor shes telling the truth joey
another burst of white noise and the image is gone
kirsty is back on that monitor just like all the others
look you can have me tell this
joey remains staring at the haunted monitor numb with shock
what the hell is going on
kirstys voice plays off as joey stares
as often as you want
theres not going to be any breakthrough
you might think its delusion but its not
i saw them
i looked into their eyes and they looked back at me
creatures from hell
a late night coffee shop in the early hours of the morning
classic american diner
a quiet counter
a cop perches on a stool drinking coffee
a trucker in a booth by himself bites methodically on a donut his eyes staring off into the vacancy of the night
in a corner booth four kids nurse cokes and smoke cigarettes
a black coffee sits by an ash tray holding a burning cigarette
sitting at the table staring at the coffee
she takes a drag on the smoke
she sips her coffee
she looks up across the diner
the double doors of the diners entrance
she looks back down at her coffee
the sound of doors opening off
terri looks up again
a walking pov as somebody approaches terri whose face breaks into a nervous ambiguous smile of welcome
as jp walks confidently to her table smiling
thanks for coming
jp sits down opposite her
he reaches over and pats her hand
joey enters the unlit main room
she glances across at the sofa
joey puts the light on
she grimaces at the chaos of the room the piles of videos and books and crosses the room to the bedroom door
she opens the door and looks in
terri we cant bunk up every night
the bedroom is empty nobody on the bed
joey leaves the door and walks back into the main room
she looks around and then walks over to the phone
something has caught her eye
a hand scrawled note by the phone reads enjoy monterey you joey registers the note
joey shakes her head sadly
what can she do
its the early hours of the morning
she has no idea where terri is
she walks back to the bedroom and closes the door behind her
thick green jungle foliage obscures the view of a pov camera
the sounds of confused battle are heard off helicopters gun fire distant explosions screams of the dying and the wounded leaves and branches smack against the frame as the unseen
dreamer rushes confusedly through the dense forest
the voices of the soldiers distant echoed repeated are heard over the roar of battle
off hes going
off were losing him
were losing him
were losing him
the sound of their voices seems to prompt the pov camera to more furious endeavor
it turns rapidly left and right forcing its way through the greenery until suddenly with one last push through foliage thick enough to be a single bush the view changes
the pov camera joey walks out into another battlefield one of a different character
it appears to be early morning
the skies are grey and overcast
in the distance plumes of black smoke spiral upward no jungle no trees or grass
the ground is baked mud disfigured with deep trenches re inforced by wooden slats
the atmosphere is post conflict guns are silent there are no cries or sound of machinery
scattered around are corpses of many khaki clad soldiers
no birds sing
it is a horrible desolate image from the bloody pages of history
the fields of flanders in world war one
a noise begins to be heard off
a low angry buzzing
a cloud of buzzing flies are feeding on the flesh of his poor dead face
the buzzing and joeys anguished cry both continue over as we joey sitting up in bed eyes wide still screaming
the cry cuts off abruptly as joey realizes where she is
she catches her breath and then freezes as she realizes that the buzzing sound from her dream is present in her bedroom
are the flies still feeding
she glances around her room
her tv set is on
the buzzing sound comes from white noise
joey is puzzled and scared
is somebody here
is somebody here
she half gets out of bed and then stops transfixed as the tv screens white noise is replaced by an image
as in the editing suite the image is grainy black and white
the buzzing continues now joined by hissing and whistling that fades in and out as if unseen hands are trying to tune into an impossibly distant station
somewhere in the sound montage we can almost hear ghostly voices whispering joey joey joey
on the screen an english officer elliott is sitting cross legged on the floor of a quonset hut
on the floor in front of him is something at which he stares something that the image is not sharp enough to show
fear vies with fascination in joeys expression
whats going on
the image disappears in a burst of static which in turn is replaced by another image still monochrome and grainy a head and shoulders of elliott staring directly out of
you have to help me joey
a burst of static and the image disappears completely
the tv is obviously not turned on
the room is silent
joey stares at her dead tv in numbed silence
she falls back into bed pulling the covers protectively around her staring at the ceiling
a click is heard off and the room is lit revealing jp by the door his finger by the light switch
he smiles into the room and walks in looking behind as terri hesitates by the door
come on in
terri moves past him
jp locks the door with a key he draws from his pocket
terri registers this
jp calms her
not a good neighborhood
a beat feel like home
its just like you left it
terri moves into the room glancing around herself cautiously
she registers the pillar
its plainly different from the last time terri saw it but despite what the audience knows about it it still seems inanimate a black frozen carving disturbing but harmless
this wasnt here
but as you can see im having some work done on it
you found a real treasure for me terri
i hope i can show you how grateful i am
yeah it looks different
yeah a girl i know helped smarten it up
put her heart and soul into it
anyone i should know
not now no
i mean now that youre here its like she doesnt even exist you know what i mean
jp has been cruising the room as they speak
now hes standing close to the pillar
terri is still some distance from him
a beat why dont you come here and kiss me
i mean its probably ticking away in both our minds right
is it going to happen
isnt it going to happen
lets get it out of the way
see how we feel
then we can relax
a pause a tense one for the audience who know that jp has obviously decided who pinheads next meal is
terri looks at jp half suspicious half attracted
i dont think so
im not ready yet
i mean weve got all night
jp smiles winningly and warmly
a nice guy
a nice smile
a smile a girl can trust
the pillar stands behind him its dark inhabitant still and silent waiting for the sacrifice
series of shots maybe all cross faded of kids dancing and drinking in the club to establish the passing of time and to highlight the tension of the scene in
jps room by its proximity to this relative normality
jp lounges against his wall smoking close to the pillar
terri is sitting on the bed
shes been telling jp about joey and the phone message
what a bitch
she was obviously just using you terri
ready to dump you the second she had what she needed interfering little whore
its like i must have done something wrong you know
freaked her out
just fucked up something good again
hey you didnt fuck it up with me
you know that
it was my fault babe it really was
and you know im sorry
and im sorry to see you upset now
i hate to see you in pain like this
terri looks up at him her eyes vulnerable on the verge of tears
she really wants to believe that hes being a nice guy
i just want to hug you
to hold you
to tell you its alright
god the bastards good at this
terri breaks into small sobs and holds her arms out for him
no sweetheart you come to me
its not fair
i come over there
were on the bed
cos you know how much you excite me
god just looking at you
youre so beautiful
i come over there and id just want to touch you
and that isnt what this is about
cmon babe come to daddy
let me make it better
terri wipes her eyes gives a small shy smile and stands up
shes walking toward jp
and the pillar
jp puts a hand out
so in need of reassurance and love
shes getting closer
as he blows it
a sidelong glance at the pillar
a sudden naked hunger in the smiling eyes
a single bead of sweat
some tiny little thing that takes the lid off his game
terri stops dead
she doesnt know whats happening but suddenly this doesnt feel right
jp smiling mask wiped off leaps at terri
terri flings herself backward screaming in shock and fear
pinhead suddenly animate and furious eyes wide open face contorted in frustrated rage black arms clawing at the air
bring her to me boy
a furious confused scene of tension and struggle
jp has hold of terri trying to drag her to the monster
terri fights back screaming her disbelief and struggling and kicking against him
they are perilously close to the pillar
pinhead is furious roaring tearing at the pillar with his hands as if trying to physically rip himself
free of it
slowly jps size and strength is telling terri is being dragged nearer and nearer to the demon
at the last possible second when it seems its all over when pinheads snatching fingers are centimeters from terris flesh terri snatches up a heavy ornament from a shelf by
the pillar and smashes jp right across the head with it
jp collapses semi conscious at the foot of the pillar
terri throws herself back from the monsters grabbing arms
pinhead snarls in frustration hands clenched in fists of rage
terri safely feet away from the pillar stands shaking and breathless eyes wide in horror and shock as she stares at this creature from nightmare
and suddenly pinhead changes tack he slides from the roaring beast of a moment before to his more usual persona the glib articulate black pope of hell
do you know where you are
youre at the door of dreams
and you can open it
what are you talking about
there are two keys in this room
on is in the pocket of this fool
you could take it out without me reaching you
a beat probably
and you could use it to let yourself back in to the world you know
the world youve always known banal hopeless dreamless
pinhead as ever is hitting the right buttons
terri as we know has dreamed of dreaming
the other is the key to dreams
to a world of black miracles and dark wonder
another life of unknown pleasures
complete the pattern
solve the puzzle
turn the key
as she looks at the monster
where is it
pinhead returns the smile
its lying bleeding at your feet
jp is on the floor semi conscious bleeding from the head
ad lib unhhh
terri edges around the pillar to grasp one of jps limp arms
as the bond between tempter and tempted is strengthened
terri holds jps arm out
pinhead stretches his own arm forward
and jp finally for one brief second of terrifying clarity realizes whats happening
i didnt mean to
pinheads hand closes around his wrist
terri leaps back out of harms way
pinhead with awesome strength yanks jp up to his feet and pulls him close
he stares into the terrified face of jp
i have such sights to show you
jp is sucked dry by pinhead
and terri watches her face perversely excited by this the first of the dark miracles that the monster had promised
as the transformation of pillar into pinhead is completed
pinhead fully fleshed and incarnate stands in the room
at his feet are the dry husk that was jp and the steaming hissing remnants of the pillar like a pool of black toxic oil
he turns and looks at terri
slowly elegantly he walks toward her
terri backs away across the room
but she backs off slowly sensuously like an eager but nervous virgin bride ready for her groom
camera moves in close on her glowing eyes and excited face
close on the box
a cloud of dust spirals out into the room in a reverse action of the dust in the antiques store
close on joeys sleeping face
rem shows beneath her eyelids and she murmurs in her sleep
very faintly off is the sound of distant music
joeys eyes snap open and glance from side to side
she sits up in bed and registers the music which seems to have grown in volume on her waking
it is strange old fashioned music a palm court string orchestra playing a sentimental waltz tune reminiscent of the s or earlier
joey looks around the room
there is no one in the room
the tv set is still dead
the bedroom door is open a crack and a very strange dim orange light is creeping in from the main room
and that seems to be from where the music is coming
as she gets out of bed
shes cautious and careful moving slowly and quietly as she wraps a robe around herself and moves to the door
the music continues to play
she opens the door slowly and walks through
this room too is empty
the music is louder and the soft warm pulse of the orange light is more distinct bathing the walls and the furniture
as joey tries to locate the source of the music and the light the sofa
the tv with the still and inactive box
the closed drapes over the big picture window
finally both the music and the light seem to be centered on the closet door across the room
theyre both coming from behind it
joey approaches the closet still tense still careful
she opens the closet door and looks in
the closet is where joey has stored her past
but shes stored it neatly
boxed and piled on shelves are old magazines old greetings cards old photographs old soft toys college diplomas clippings from small town newspapers death of a local hero tommy summerskill
lost in vietnam joanne summerskill class valedictorian looks to career in media etc etc
also in there stuffed away at the top of the closet is an old radio a big old wood and wire grille valve driven beauty from which the lilting music
at some stage in its life part of its casing was smashed away and the pulsing orange light is its flickering vacuum tubes
its an old mains powered model and its mains cord dangles off the shelf of the closet
this radio isnt plugged into anything except the paranormal
close on joey staring at this broadcast from the beyond
joey reaches up and brings the radio down from the shelf and out into the main room
she sets it down on the coffee table in front of the sofa
formal classical framing from a low angle joey and radio in foreground big picture window and its closed drapes in the background
joey kneels up in front of the table
she stares at the radio with the same kind of trapped fascination with which we have seen characters in the previous hellraiser movies stare at the box
her fingers are drawn to the tuning dial as if to a puzzle
she plays with the dial moving through various stations
joeys face is open with expectation as she moves through them as if she is waiting for clues
the music gives way to various voices an indian voice giving some kind of commentary
the english words bbc and world service are heard amidst the punjabi
joey turns the dial a tired sad english voice and the king has sent a personal message of sympathy to the parents of those brave men who
joey turns the dial a resonant french voice loiseau chante avec ses doigts
joey turns the dial another burst of music this time more raucous and syncopated
a ragtime tune from the birth of jazz
joey turns the dial dead air
an ominous pause
and elliotts voice
look out your window
joey shrinks back in nervous shock at this direct address
the radio goes dead
the tubes stop glowing
the room is now a dimly lit place of shadow and suspense
joey glances back over her shoulder at her closed drapes and then at the silent radio
she stands up slowly and crosses to the drapes
the camera rises and tracks in as she walks framing those drapes like curtains in a theater
with one strong gesture joey sweeps the drapes open
instead of neighboring roof tops and a view of the city joey is looking directly into the interior of a quonset hut
it is the image from her tv set though full size full color and apparently real
at the far end elliott sits cross legged on the floor
in front of him on the floor is the puzzle box
elsewhere in the hut a camp bed on which lie a gun belt and an officers peaked cap
and an old fashioned radio the same radio that is still in joeys room
as she stares beyond her window into this impossible scene
closer on the elements in the hut as we and joey realize that everything in there is frozen in time
there is no movement no sound
wonderingly but carefully joey stretches her arm out before her
when her arm reaches the threshold of the quonset hut it disappears into the space once occupied by window glass
she pulls her arm back sharply with an intake of breath
maybe she even takes a half step backward
im seven floors up
im seven floors up
but she can
she summons her courage steps over the sill and walks into the impossible
we are looking at a solid wall
then through the wall joey walks into the hut still bewilderment by the sights around her
still the image does not move
everything is very real very present
joey approaches the immobile elliott and looks from him to the box and back again
nb joeys speeches to the frozen elliott are bravado her face and body language betray her awed nervousness at the bizarre situation in which she finds herself
i just walked into madness for you
joey looks back behind her
there is no window back into the apartment just a fourth wall
thats just great
you bring me here
you freeze up on me
and now theres no way out
ive had dates like you before
a creak is heard off
joey looks up
at the far end of the quonset hut behind elliott a door has creaked open an inch or two
joey looks from the door back to the frozen elliott
joey crosses to the door and opens it
she walks through
joey walks out onto the world war one battlefield of her most recent dream
she stands there an incongruous vulnerable figure in her nightdress and robe amidst the corpses the trenches and the distant plumes of smoke
whats going on
is this a dream
she glances back at the door of the hut she has just left
within the hut the frozen elliott still sits
as she turns from looking into the hut and gasps her eyes wide in shock
standing on a hillock framed against the grey battlefield skies is elliott
joey walks toward him
elliott stands calmly and smiles at joey
how kind of you to come
joey and the audience take in elliotts impossible presence as she and he stand amidst the corpse strewn field
you have to help me
i dont understand
am i dreaming this
you have to help me
you will understand
and no youre not dreaming
do you know where we are
i dont know
first world war right
the fields of france
and many dead flowers
my name was spenser
he extends his hand
joey slowly and nervously puts her hand out to shake his
elliott smiles understandingly as he releases her hand
youve probably never shaken hands with a ghost before am i right
what the hell is going on
hell is precisely what is going on joey
and we have to stop it
i because of a special obligation you because youre the only person who can help
and because you know what is right and just and true
will you walk with me a while
he gestures with his hand and they begin to walk
there were days in this war days right on top of each other when the newly dead were numbered in the tens of thousands
they called it the war to end all wars
though it didnt
you know that
there were more wars
your fathers war
your dream search for your father led you here
joey we need to talk
elliott does nothing dramatic he doesnt clap his hands or snap his fingers but somehow magically he and joey without moving or changing position are back in the quonset hut
the frozen elliott is still sitting on the floor before the box
the mobile elliott gestures at his frozen self as he speaks to the bemused joey
the war pulled poetry out of some of us
others it affected differently
this is me a few years later
were in india by the way and its
i was like many survivors
lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification
wed seen god fail you see
so many dead
for us god too fell at flanders
we adjusted to the loss
and if we mourned we mourned in silence
thousands drank themselves to death
others went further
i went further
i thought i was a lost soul
but until this frozen moment i didnt even know what the phrase meant
and what is
this frozen moment
the cusp of my life
what i was what i am what i will be
past present future all bound here at this timeless moment of decision
i was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures
opening the box was my final act of exploration of discovery
and what did you discover
and why are you back
why are we here
again no signal from elliott but the background changes magically once more elliott is once again framed dramatically on the hillock joey standing close
because something worse is coming
a beat i opened the box joey
i found the monster within it
and it found the monster within me
for decades i served hell with no memory of my former life until a friend released me
you saw her
if your soul was freed why are you back
because monster as i was i was bound by laws
the protocol of hell
the box had to be opened to let me out
the truly innocent were safe
thats no longer true
the shell of the beast has been fleshed
what i was is out there joey
in your world
what will he do
what does he want
hell do what he does best
but hell do it unfettered
he wants to walk the earth forever indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering
what can we do
i like you joey
you ask all the right questions
there is something we can do but it will require great courage
i dont know
elliott reaches out and strokes her cheek
we see in joeys eyes that there is a response there
a response beyond the comradely
joey you walked through your window from one reality to another
youre stronger than you think
then tell me what to do
this is his first night on earth
he wants to close the door behind him
like all lieutenants he covets command
theres a gateway to hell through which he can be taken back
he has to destroy it
so where is it
the box joey
he wants the box
its a wild night at under the underground and its about to get wilder
the source music thrash metal builds and builds as if heading for a climax
and then the climax comes
the door blasts open explosively from within
the pieces of the shattered door fly across the dance floor accompanied by chunks of plaster and brick from the door surround
flying wood and masonry hit people
one chunk smashes into the dj console bringing the music to a scratching screeching end
various screams are heard off through the ensuing silence
in the confusion kids scramble for the main doorway
is it a bomb
is it a street gang attack
the main doorway slams supernaturally shut bolts flying into place untouched by human or inhuman hand
confused and frightened faces turn back to look at the source of the explosion
lit from behind by blinding beams of blue light pinhead emerges through the doorway
pinhead surveys the scene before him and the terrified and awe struck crowd look back at him
for the most part the crowd are stunned into silence but there are a few murmurs from them ad lib oh my god
what the fuck
no no no no no no no
pinhead scans the club
he looks at the terrified humans
the cruelly beautiful artworks
a small smile forms on his face
hes just had an entertaining idea
the view through the big picture window is entirely normal again the cityscape by night
suddenly joey seems to appear behind the glass translucent like a reflection and comes through the window into her apartment solidifying as she steps in
her hands are at her head and she staggers forward a few steps
its as if the enormity of her trip thru realities has just hit her
she falls forward onto the floor of her room unconscious
as the ringing of a phone grows in volume
joey raises her head bleary eyed and glances round the room trying to locate the source of the noise that has woken her
she crawls the few feet to the phone and snatches at it
the hand set falls and she has to gather it up from the floor
maneuvering herself into a sitting position she speaks
on phone you wanted a story
you got it
turn on the tv now
and then get your ass down here
she puts the phone down and rushes across to turn on the tv
the images are confusing with the rapid pans and temporary loss of focus or light that characterise raw news footage
docs camera weaves amongst a mass of uniformed people trying to catch clear pictures of whats been happening
sirens howl red emergency lights flash
it becomes clear we are looking at the aftermath of a disaster
or a massacre
the club building looks like a bomb hit it
smoke and debris litter the street
so do corpses
some of the dead bodies are simply dead bodies
others glimpsed fleetingly and tantalizingly as doc is jostled and bustled seem to be mutilated decoratively
in fact they bear hideous similarities to the artworks that used to grace the club armless torsos wrapped in barbed wire flayed limbs with machinery inside instead of muscle
off judas priest
will you look at
suddenly the images are blocked by a very burly cop pushing at the camera and talking directly into it
off i dont give a shit
move it or lose it
close on joeys face as she reacts in horror to what she is seeing
intercut with docs footage oh my god its happening
docs camera pans around the area past rubbernecking crowds past shadowed alleys past police cars and ambulances vehicles and then whips back to an alley in the distance
i think theres something up there
joeys eyes widen in horror as she speaks uselessly to the screen
no doc dont
the hubbub and noise has died away
docs camera is advancing up a very dimly lit alley
hardly any detail can be seen
the camera creeps forward
then suddenly a barely glimpsed movement very close to the side and the camera swings wildly toward it
the face of pinhead almost lost to the darkness of the alley is glimpsed on the screen as it looms toward the lens
the image disappears to darkness over which docs scream of mortal terror and agony can be heard before the blackness is suddenly replaced by a station identification card and then
a very harried anchorperson at a studio desk
yes weve temporarily lost our pictures there and and
joey has her hands at her mouth in horror
joey leaps to her feet grabs the box from the tv and stares at it in her hand
joeys hands grip her steering wheel tightly
her face is drawn and grim
the box is on the seat beside her
she is driving very fast
she has to slam on the brakes at a red light
she pounds at the dashboard in frustration
close on a terrified face
the face belongs to eddie a year old runner for a drug gang
his head is pressed tight against a brick wall
his nose is bleeding and his eye is red and ready to bruise
ill get it
a fist slams into eddies face
eddie is being held against the wall by two uniformed cops one in his s one in his s
the elder cop has just punched eddie in the face
dont promise me shit you little fuck
you know what your promise is worth to me
fifty per cent of fuck all
give him the money eddie
a big back handed slap from the elder cop
give him the money eddie
just listen to me please
the elder cop gut punches him and eddie doubles up
im done listening shit brain
where you been all day
they shut the school
give him the money eddie
tell ya im gonna puke if he beats on you any more
just give him the
the younger cop pauses looking beyond them down the alley as a long black shadow falls over them
the elder cop at the change in his partners tone looks up
standing in the center of the alley at its far end light coming from behind him so that he is unclear is pinhead
expecting obedience you fuckoff
he turns back to eddie
get your head outta your stinkin ass and look at me boy
still looking down alley hey
pinhead is moving up the alley towards the action
elder cop shoves eddie away
to eddie get lost
eddie doesnt waste time with questions
the cops straighten up and start walking to meet pinhead
pinhead advances still in the shadows still just a black shape moving forward
i have the distinct impression i told you to fuckoff
unless i miss my guess youve just disobeyed an officer of the law
pinhead emerges into the dim light in the alley
i am the law
cops halt in shock at this awesome presence both of them instinctively drawing their guns
and both instinctively beginning to back up
youre one butt ugly son of a bitch and youre about to dead meat
i am the son of eternal night and you are about to discover pain has no ending
well thats enough of a direct threat for any officer of the law
both cops fire their guns
pinhead keeps walking
he spits out the bullets that his body has absorbed
they empty their guns useless and then they turn and run down the alley
and then stop short
there is a sudden wall of impenetrable blackness in front of them as if the world simply comes to a stop four yards from their feet
the cops turn terrified to look back
instinctively they spread apart each walking near to opposite walls
the younger cop is standing beneath a fire escape
he glances up as if he might be able to jump up to safety
pinheads head flicks upward as if in a gesture of command
suddenly the fire escape ladder zooms downward with impossible speed and force
the younger cop doesnt even have time to scream
the ladder smashes right through his body impaling him
his corpse stands there twitching and shuddering wrapped around the ladder
elder cop stares in terror at his partners fate
pinhead stands very still and speaks very calmly
curb your tongue
the elder cops body starts to move involuntarily
his movements are jerky and spasmodic as if his mind is trying to fight what his body is trying to do
pinheads head moves through various positions
his face is calm showing no particular pleasure at what he is doing but only a fascinated concentration as if experimenting with new found skills
the elder copts shaking puppet like hands draw his handcuffs from his belt
his eyes show terror
everything else is beyond his control
he raises the cuffs to head level and springs one of them open
his mouth suddenly jerks open and his tongue protrudes
the fear in his eyes increases
he moves the open cuff over his tongue
hes making panicked moaning noises as if trying to scream
he drives the cuff closed right through his tongue
and screams as best he can
pinhead looks beyond the cop to the wall of blackness and makes another commanding gesture with his head
a chain flies from the darkness and wraps itself around the other cuff
the chain pulls taut and then suddenly retracts into the darkness hauling the cop off his feet and dragging him along the alley into the blackness
the cop screams and moans all the way until he is enveloped into the darkness and then the sounds suddenly stop dead
a paramedic is attempting to hold joey back
in the distance behind them is the wreckage of the club
they are standing near the alley into which docs camera disappeared
but i have to see him
im his friend
lady trust me
you really dont want to go
but joey has slipped past his obstructing arm and runs on into the alley
and pulls to a horrified stop
the scene is well lit by police emergency lights
it is taped off by yellow do not cross banners
paramedics and cops stand around in various states of shock or disgust
in the middle of it all is doc
the body is kneeling up its cold hands resting on its lap and holding its severed head which stares up at its shoulders
the camera has been shoved deep between the corpses shoulder blades and is angled down as if filming its dead face
close on joeys devastated face
an establishing shot of a church at the top of a small hill
the church is in semi darkness
some candles at an offertory some others on an altar provide the only light
on the very front pew a priest sits head bent low in prayer
the priest is a young man
probably a good man
were not really going to have the time to find out
a shadow seems to pass over the priests bowed head
at first it seems he hasnt noticed
then he looks up a little puzzled
he looks to his right his left then shifts in the pew to look back along the central aisle
there are rows and rows of empty pews and in the distance the church door
which is ajar
the priest stands walks to the start of the aisle and looks back along it again
calling down aisle is there anyone there
the priest looks puzzled
we see his mind work
hes looked right looked left looked down
he turns right round to face the altar
to the priest its an image of nightmarish blasphemy
even to us heathens its pretty shocking pinhead in all his dark glory is standing behind the altar
how dare you
it gets worse
pinhead staring at the priest all the while reaches his hand to the back of his head and begins to extract one of the pins from his skull
the pin is horribly long and sickeningly the last few inches arent metal at all but some kind of infernal worm dark slimy and befanged
pinhead presses the worm against his palm and it instantly burrows through his flesh pulling its pin tail behind it
he repeats the operation with the other palm
he turns his palms out to show the priest in a blasphemous parody of christs stigmata
i am the way
the priest rushes up to the altar to pinhead
youll burn in hell for this
the priest reaches him
pinheads hand is on his throat instantly squeezing silence from him
what a limited imagination
the choking priest kicks and struggles as pinhead forces him to his knees before him
pinhead towers over the priest
with his free hand he gouges out a piece of his own flesh from the decorative wounds on his chest
he holds the bloody piece of meat up
this is my body
this is my blood
happy are they who come to my supper
pinhead shoves the disgusting lump of blue and bloody flesh into the priests aghast mouth
pinhead flings the priest away from him
the priest lands heavily on the floor
pinhead walks forward smashing the altar aside
all the candles flicker as if an unheard wind is blowing through the church
pinhead walks up the aisle toward the semi conscious priest
and all the candles go out
joey is driving again
and this time shes not even stopping at red lights
she steams across junctions leaving cars swerving and horns honking in her wake
something catches her eye and she throws a glance to her side
appalled oh god
up a side street atop a hill is the inner city church
its on fire
joey swings the car up the hill
joey getting out of the car nearer the burning church
off to her side is a smaller building the church hall
joey shakes her head at the desecration
she has no doubt whos responsible
having fun en route you bastard
suddenly a creaking noise from behind her
joey freezes in terror then slowly very slowly turns round
the priest now mercifully dead is crucified against the side wall of the smaller building
pinheads nails protrude from his palms and his ankles
a series of quick cuts of joeys car tearing through the darkness heading back to her apartment
joey rushes down the corridor to her apartment door hurriedly turns the lock and rushes in
joey closes her door and switches on the light
the mood is suddenly different after the frenzied drive across town
its very still very slow very quiet
perhaps its too quiet joey moves into the room slowly clutching the box in her hands and glancing round
her manner makes the mood suddenly creepy
is the monster already in the house
very slowly very carefully joey begins to move round her apartment
hardly breathing making no sudden movements she checks her doors
joey stands back in the center of her main room facing out to her big picture window
slowly she lets out a big breath and then draws an equally slow one in
maybe its alright
maybe the monster isnt here
magically eerily slowly the box begins to rise from joeys hand
her eyes stare in horror as it ascends through the air
maybe theres one place she hasnt checked
swallowing nervously joey tilts her head up and back her eyes rising up in their sockets
the camera tilts low
taking in a wider view of the room and its ceiling and the ascending box
and the audience screams
like a spider or a lizard pinhead is flat against the ceiling arms stretched out for balance his face staring down at joey
joey throws her hands to her mouth and screams
pinhead angling down feet first floats elegantly to the floor to stand facing joey
the box lands in one of his outstretched hands
he holds it out to show joey
and then suddenly closes his powerful hand on it apparently crushing it
he flings the remnants from him and they land on joeys floor chunks and splinters of wood whirring and spinning machinery of gold and silver and scores of tiny writhing
thanks to the miracles of trick photography the remnants suddenly come back together and reassemble themselves into the box which sits there intact on the floor
the box cant be destroyed
like pain or the poor it is always with us
but as long as i have it no one can open it
now come here and die
you have friends in hell waiting to greet you
joey begins to back across the room toward her window
youll have to come and get me you ugly bastard
ill enjoy making you bleed
ill enjoy making you enjoy it
pinhead starts across the room
joey looks at her window
its the normal view
with the normal seven story drop
she bites her lip goes for it in a literal and metaphorical leap of faith she runs headlong at the window and jumps at it
the window shatters
pinheads arm reaches out after joey as if to grab her and pull her back
shows his arm entering the shattered window and also shows the night time cityscape beyond the window
what it doesnt show is the front of the monsters arm
thats somewhere else
close on pinheads arm still clutching at the air
suddenly a khaki uniformed arm moves into shot and grasps pinheads hand arm wrestling style
elliott literally pulls pinhead through from one reality to another we see parts of the monster appearing and disappearing in front of the hut wall as if glimpsed through tears
its like a tug of war which elliott wins suddenly pinheads there on the floor of the quonset hut
and his other self elliott still has hold of his hand
pinhead throws a glance around the hut
he recognizes it
and the frozen figure at the top end perched before the box
furious rage aahhhh
back to the wall quickly
joey runs around then to the far wall just in time because now the pyrotechnics start
elliott tightens his grip and with a nice series of intercut close ups of these two alternative selves the life forces of elliott and pinhead begin to erupt
electric blue light begins to play over both their bodies
its apparently agonizing both figures arching with the pain both faces grimacing
joey watches wincing in sympathetic agony
what about you
where will you be
elliott grunts his answer through the agony
back with the damned
no more hope of heaven
but i drag this monster back with me
you stupid interfering foo
the essences of pinhead and elliott drawn from their bodies as sweeping glowing spitting arcs of blue light crackle in the air of the hut like a miniature electrical storm
until they suddenly lock together in one more powerful arc which flies at the body of the seated officer and disappears inside him in a blinding flash of light
and suddenly as vision returns there is only the seated officer and at the far end of the room joey
and almost as suddenly the frozen scene comes to life the radio near the camp bed is playing
a bead of sweat falls down the officers face as he reaches forward to pick up the box
the officer apparently completely unaware of joeys presence begins to work the box
as the process works through we intercut constantly between the officers hands and the movements of the box here in the hut in
exactly matching movements of the box back on the floor of joeys apartment in
moving on its own linked across the years to its earlier self
joey watching the movements in the hut
you cant hear me can you
im not really here
suddenly small patterns of blue light arc across the box shocking the officer who drops the box and then stares in shock and fascination as
on the floor the box begins to open
the officer kneels up and leans over the box
and the chains fly
shooting up from within and hooking themselves cruelly into the officers face and chest
close on the officers face howling in agony
close on joeys face sobbing in distress
she throws up her hands to hide the unbearable sight from herself and when she lowers them
shes back in her room
joey stares around her face a mix of sadness and relief
the mood now is very down post cataclysmic post adventure
joey takes a deep slow breath and crosses the room toward the kitchen door
she crosses the floor without glancing down at it
why should she
but we notice even if she doesnt that the box is no longer there
but we hardly have time to register this before
joey opens the kitchen door
pinhead is framed in the doorway
behind him instead of her kitchen is the black space of hell like the torture rooms in hellraiser and hellbound it is full of shadowy pillars and chains
oh no kiss of welcome after years
joey backs away shaking her head in shocked denial
pinhead moves forward very leisurely
this will be so good joey
you loved him didnt you
i can feel him inside weeping for you
he can watch through the centuries as we discover the things that make you whimper
joeys mood breaks and she turns and rushes for her front door
she reaches it throws it open
jp monroe is in the doorway but hes only just recognizable
hes now a cenobite blue skinned scarred mutilated and decorated with metal and leather
you never met did you
this was jp monroe
have you seen what they did to me
have you seen what they did
you interfering little whore
the jp cenobite moves into the room
joey now near hysteria rushes across the room again to the one remaining door her bedroom
she throws that one open
and terri the new female cenobite walks out at her
she has the open box in her hand and several cigarette protruding from different holes in her cheek and face
oh go on
you think youre going to live forever
pinhead and jp are advancing across the room toward joey and terri
joey only has seconds to act
wanna light you bitch
joey pulls her fathers zippo from her pocket and sparks it up as she swings it through the air close to terris face
a huge flame shoots out of the zippo as in the earlier scene and scours across terris face
terri howls in terror throws her hands to her face
and the box flies from her hands
joey catches it spins it closes it
an arc of blue light zaps across to terri and shes gone
still in one movement swinging on her heels joey twists the box again
and another arc of light zaps jp away
joey completes her turn
shes facing pinhead
she holds the box before her like a weapon
and shes got the monster in her sights
his hands are raised palms out
hes stopped advancing
joey holds the box ready breathing heavy waiting
you can send me back
i can help you joey
i can give you what you want
youll never know what i want
despite what shes said we see joeys face register every word of pinheads reply every nuance every promise
you and i can put your name on the worlds lips your face on its screens
camera tracks closer to the box in joeys hands as pinhead speaks
closer and closer until its side fills the screen
close on the face of the box still filling the screen
slow pull back to reveal that the box is mounted on a plinth within a glass bell jar
pull back continues
the bell jar stands on a tall thin wooden sculpture stand
pull back continues
the stand is next to a large impressive desk in an even larger even more impressive office
and seated behind the desk is
well we cant really call her joey shes far too impressive for that
her hair is different
her make up is different
her clothes are different
everything about this woman speaks of power and sophistication
