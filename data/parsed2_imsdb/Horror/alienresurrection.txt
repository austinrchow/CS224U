alien resurrection we sweep slowly across an endless tapestry of stars
finally she comes into view the u
a massive research vessel that sits majestically just beyond plutos orbit
we track along the side of the ship and along the silent empty corridors coming at last to a door with two guards standing rigid in front of it
full armour powerful shockrifles expressions empty and cold
along a row of screens where we see the first signs of life readouts lights data all shifting and collating on the blinking screens
as we move along them a figure in a labcoat passes through the frame then another leading us along the lab to settle on what looks like a cryogenic tube
not big enough for a human
still tracking around it we glimpse inside some vague fetal mass encased in a clear aspic like gel
tubes and cables a attached to the mass running out of the machine
as we still circle the shape begins to be more coherent till we can see what might even be a face
eyes shut tight
a birds eyes view of a field the soft golden waves filling the screen
sharp contrast to what we have seen before
there is a woman wandering through the field
beside her a girl seven or eight in dingey sundress
both have black tousled hair
my mom always said there were no monsters no real ones but there are
the girl stops looks around her
the wheat comes all the up to her chest and nothing else is visible as far as she see
she looks back at the woman but the woman is already more than fifty yards away
the girls expression becomes perplexed
she slaps a bug on the back of her neck
pulls it off and is huge wriggling fleshily in her hand
her expression becomes even more distraught but she cannot muster forth a shout
the sound of insects fills the air
another bug lands on her another
she looks down in growing horror and sees blood
at her feet rising filling the field rising above the wheat a sea of blood now dark thick
the girl tries again to scream raises her arms
she is completely covered in insects a skittering black shroud of them and when she finally does scream they flood into her mouth
instruments show a jolt in heart rate blood pressure
scientists note it down look over at the thing in aspic
we can tell that time has passed because it is much bigger nearly the size of a man and in a new case
the camera moves in on the cardiograph then moves down to show a second one
tracking a smaller much faster heartbeat
dark and we are moving through it at impossible speed turning into another without slowing up into an air vent still moving moving until we reach a chamber some place
where all we can see is a mass of dark moving inhuman fle it welcomes us in envelops us
angle ripley lying somewhere maybe the dark chamber in the dream it keeps shifting
she opens her eyes but they are dark whiteless
she reaches for her chest and begins scratching
tearing at it as blood wells up spilling over her sides
and the cause of this dream becomes apparant being cut open with a lasersaw
we see her body still has a layer of the aspic slime clinging to it
and her skin is unnaturally blue
but as we pan from her chest to her face her identity is unmistakable
around her are several men in operating masks
cutting her gediman a young and enthusiastic scientist
one man seemingly in charge stands a bit off watching
this by tag on his coat is dr wren
ready with the amnio
gediman finishes cutting
another man steps in with a clamp
pulls apart the chest
there she is
he says it like hes found a lost kitten
he reaches in an pulls out a sleeping fetal but nearly ready to burst alien
others work at severing umbilical threads that tie it to ripleys chest
here we go
he holds it up and others step in with the amnio a sort of incubator filled with amniotic fluid
the alien screams its tiny mouth full with teeth and wriggles out of his grasp
everybody panics but before the thing can get completely away from him gediman grabs it and sticks it in the amnio
someone shuts the top rapidly
everybody looks at each other for a moment
a surgeon looks at ripleys readings
gediman looks at wren hopefully
sew her back up
gediman and the surgeon get to work as the others carefully remove the alien
well that went as well as could be expected ripleys hand lashes out grabs the surgeons forearm
he yells in pain as her fingers dig into him the others scramble knocking things over and we hear his bone cracking
ripley crouches in the middle of a small dark chamber
shes wide eyed staring straight ahead in a state of near catatonia
hair tangled and wild
but at least shes not so blue as before
the only light on her comes from directly above from a thick pane of glass in the center of the ceiling
a guard stands on the floor above looking into the cell through the square of glass in the floor directly above ripley
we see other panes of glass lining the floor indicating more cells below
she is still for a long while
then she lifts her hands looking at them
touches her face her skin
she fingers her tunic pulls down the neck
there is a scar running along her chest
she fingers it thoughtfully
she looks at her forearm
tattooed near the crook of her elbow is the number
she looks up her face unreadable
ripley is sitting on a table as gediman draws blood from her
he deposits it in a test beaker studies her eyes
wren enters looking at a chart
hows our number eight today
appears to be in good health
noticing his tone how good
as in completely off our projected charts
shows him some photos look at the scar tissue
see the recession
this is from yesterday
this is good
this is very good
id like to run some tests strength coordination
were not looking at a normal cloning arc
wren goes up to ripley studies her face with satisfaction
well it looks like youre going to make us all very proud
she grabs his throat with dazzling speed applying deadly pressure as she brings his face to hers
her eyes are burn but lost
oh my god
he is as wide eyed as wren and he isnt having his windpipe crushed
after a moment the shock wears off and he slams his hand into the alarm
klaxons red light fire up
a guard rushes in levels his weapon at ripley
after a moment of staring him down she opens her hand
wren falls to his knees gasping
the guard fires his rifle at her a powerful electrical charge lashes out and sends her flying back into the corner
im all right
the guards keep their weapons burners these shockrifles are called leveled at ripley
she has recovered from the shock quickly sits crumpled in the corner looking at nothing in particular
ripley wearily why
wren and gediman watch through a one way mirror as a scientist tests ripley
with them is general perez the man in charge this boat
ramrod straight and about as gruff as you would expect he stares at ripley suspiciously
the scientist is holding up cards with pictures on them house dog boat
ripley gives answers we cant hear through the glass looking pissed off and bored
shes operating at a completely adult capacity
and her memories
there are gaps
and theres some degree of cognitive dissonance
wren shoots gediman a stern look at his unscientific parlance
it has some connective difficulties
a kind of low level emotional autism
perez looks at ripley through the glass then exits into the hall
the two scientists follow pace him as he strides down towards a second observation room
but the thing is we cant terminate her
you havent told me what you think has caused this
cloned genes dont contain memory cells not even when theyre brought to adult term
theres been cases
not like this
well we dont have nearly enough data
but in some cases there is a collective memory passed down generationally
at a genetic level
like instinct only more complex structurally
in some cases
youre talking about the alien
you promised me there wasnt going to be any crossing
its not like the other ones
perez punches code puts his hand on the scanner and the second observation room door opens
he steps in the other two right behind him
darker than the first one and with two of the heavily armoured guards by the door
apart from that identical
perez turns to the others
but there is some genetic mix
will there be further mutation
mutation isnt exactly
i dont think so
thats one of the things we need to study
you can keep it
but secure under obsorvation and for gods sake keep it away from here
i dont want any more surprises
and as he speaks the alien rises right behind him its big the ridges on its head indicating a young queen it hisses and lunges at the back of his
the reinforced plastic window between them which we couldnt see stops it
as it hits a thin laser grid buzzes to life sparks crackling on the aliens face
its bile trails darkly on the glass as it backs off
perez turns to look at it with the others
it took a hell of a lot to get us here
wren shoots him another look
how soon before this ones ovulating
is that normal
no way of knowing for sure but id say its accelerated
after a moment were going to need the supplies
ripley sits across from gediman
he is eating at a good pace ripley however has stopped
she is staring at her fork her brows furrowed
turns it over in her hand in her mind
the memory comes and she shakes her head wearily
ripley softly fuck
gediman pretending to correct her fork
ever so slightly she smiles
the smile fades and after a moment how did you
how did we get you
blood samples from fiori
do you remember that place
does it grow
its a queen
how did you know that
everyone in the
searches for the word then spits it out
he has entered behind her comes up to the table
our ripleys former employers
terran growth conglom had some defense contracts under the military
before your time gediman they went under decades ago bought out by walmart
fortunes of war
to ripley youll find things have changed a good deal since your time
were not flying blind here you know
this is united systems military not some greedy corporation
the potential benefits of this race go way beyond urban pacification
new alloys new vaccines
theres nothing like this in any world weve seen
you should be very proud
she laughs bitterly
oh i am
and the animal itself is wonderous
theyll be invaluable once weve harnessed them
its a cancer
you cant teach it tricks
this stops wren and he retreats silently
ripley repeats word to herself thinking
as wren is leaving the mess he is accosted by an ensign
doctor general perez is asking for you
weve been hailed
we see the auriga far in the distance suddenly a ship roars into frame heading for it
a small vessel it is every bit dirty and jerry rigged as the auriga is pristine
to accentuate the difference the sudden roar of its engines is accompanied by the music is coming from nearby
piloting the ship toward the auriga is hillard a roughskinned woman in her forties along with rane a slight and quiet fellow
behind them stands elgyn the leader of the group
has the kind of authority that doesnt need to flaunt itself
maybe fifty by the silver in his hair
he speaks into the vidcom good naturedly my authorization code is fuck you son
now open the goddamn bay or general perez is gonna do a wichita stomp on your virgin ass
he switches off
i guarantee that boys
never seen the inside of a woman
to hillard bring us in on three oh descent ride the parallel
darlin its done
dont cut thrust till six hundred meters
give em a little fright
he puts his hand on her shoulder runs it up along her cheek as he exits
theyre more than friends
he moves through a hallway sticks his head in a cubicle
rise and shine
he proceeds into its the largest space in this boat two stories high
taking up most of the space are two harvesters big rusty hovering threshers roughly the size of winnebagos
as elgyn enters we crane up to reveal annalee call working atop one of them
shes young tough at home with this motley bunch despite her youth and prettiness
the music is louder here its blasting from a box in the corner
elgyn switches it off
are the cargo trucks secured
i checked em an hour ago
i dont want em so much as rattled
any leakage i take it out of your hide
trust me boss
elgyn laughs not my style
he leans down looks under the thresher
lying on a gurneylike steel dolly working under the machine is vriess chie mechanic
late forties in pretty good shape considering hes got no legs
hows it looking
vriess its never gonna be pretty
but shell fly
the other ones a total fucking write off
youll make it good
dont be so sure
calls out call
adjust the generator plugs
elgyn straightening up they just gotta run vriess
they dont gotta run far
christie is up and mostly dressed
he is black very large and has distinctly military bearing
he speaks with quiet dont fuck with me authority
whats our status
were coming in
time to enjoy a little of the generals hospitality
st just san jhoost is slim asian and the epitome of cool
moves quickly and silently a sly grin playing about lips
he is strapping a contraption to his forearm
it resembles a deringer holder but a very complex one
elgyn we could use a rest till the heats off and vriess can get those harvesters on their feet
thisll keep us for a couple of days assuming the natives are friendly
we expecting any trouble
i doubt it
still lets be ever vigilant
angle vriess working intently the extremely nasty blades of the thresher inches above his head
im patched in
check the sequence timer
no answer call
a hand reaches in toward the on switch
the thresher grinds to life a hundred blades and claws spinning at vriesss head
vriess wheels out from under the machine in a second flat
the second hes out he hits a lever and the back of the dolly flies up transforming it into a wheelchair
you son of a whore
johner jumps down from the machine laughing
hes thickset mean and ugly with ugly scars crisscrossing his ugly bald head
thought id give you a little haircut there
call who has been over on the other side of the thresher ably climbs up on it and switches it off
you should see your face
vriess you must have soiled yourself
vriess one of these days im gonna kill you
my hand to god
well you already gave him your feet
call jumping down youre a limp fucking scrotum you know that
either of you want a piece of me im less than busy
hes been sucking down too much homebrew
dont push me little annalee
you hang with us a while youll learn im not the man with whom to fuck
he exits full of annoying bravado
that inbred cocksucker
he feels his forehead comes up with a bit of blood
realizes how close it was
call looks up at the thresher
well now we know it works
as it opens to admit the proportionally tiny ship
the bay on the bottom of the auriga the doors are actually over the ship which rises into the airlock
the outer doors close under the ship
pressurized air shoot into the airlock for a few seconds and then the inner door opens
the ship rising into the bay
the ship moves slowly along the huge dock to land gently at far end
the top of the ship is nearly level with a grated platform that runs the length of the bay
three soldiers in full armour stand rigid on the platform
the hatch atop the ship slowly opens
one by one the crew files out
seeing them en masse we get a clearer view of what separates them from this environment
theyre not wearing uniforms
theyre an eclectic fiercely indivualist group their look varied spots of bright color showing through militarian space gear
johners bright tuorquise bowling shirt
elgys and st justs floorlength leather dusters
even vriesss chair stands out as he wheels down the platform
what they have in common is the toughness the wary eyes leathery skin
the cool readiness to kill
these guys are smugglers
a long while ago youd have called them pirates all eight of them emerge one by one looking around them
they file past the silent uniformed soldiers
the last one suddenly puts a hand on johners jacket stops him
there is a bulge under it
a green sensor light on the back of the soldiers glove turns red when he touches the bulge
no projectile weaponry is allowed on board the vessel sir
johner opens his jacket shows what hes packing a large thermos
much more dangerous
elgyn to perez what do you think were going to hijack the vessel
all eight of us
no i think one of your asshole crew is going to get drunk and put a bullet through the hull
we are in space elgyn
he enters from the antechamber motions for the crew to follow him
vriess comes abreast of the soldier
wanna check the chair
the soldier makes no response simply falls in behind call the last of them
the long neck that connects the bay to the body of the ship
the group proceeds down it the crew looking about them at the sterile grandeur
this place is really clean
johner to a guard hey
you got any whores on this vessel
the guard remains stonefaced any loose women with bad eyesight
i think youll find our accomodations somewhat spartan
although the cook sets a good table
johner that aint what im hungry for
vriess to call whats the matter
she is looking around her somewhat tensely
i dont like army
yeah join the fucking club
a stack of bills dropped down on a desk then another
theyre green and identifiably money
but theyre square about the size of cocktail napkins
the face on them is unfamiliar
thousand dollar bills
a good sized suite decorated in a sparse military fashion
perez is behind his desk the money sitting between him and elgyn
this wasnt easy to come by
neither was our cargo
youre not pleading poverty are you
were well funded
i mean the bills
theres not many that still deal in coin
just the ones that dont like their every transaction recorded
the fringe element
i guess that would include you though wouldnt it
im guessing whatever youve got going here wasnt exactly approved by congress
perez pours two whiskeys
perez changing the subject so where do you go from here
out by the handle
weve got a couple of harvesters we can unload em on one of the collectives if vriess and call get em working
whered you find her
she is severely fuckable isnt she
and the very devil with a socket wrench
i think vriess somewhat pines
he takes a stack of bill smells it
he likes the smell
she is curious about this little transaction
you can hardly blame her awfully cloak and dagger
perez hands a drink to elgyn
this is an army operation
most army research labs dont have to operate outside regulated space
and they dont call for the kind of cargo we brought
do you want something elgyn
just bed and board couple of days worth
if were not imposing
not at all
keep out of the restricted areas dont start any fights and mi casa is yours too
elgyn drinks to that
i trust of course that you can mind your own business
elgyn smiles im famous for it
the cargo is rolled down the corridor armed guards flank it
it is wheeled into where wren and a few others are waiting
gediman looks a little nervous not sure this is a good idea
the cargo is locked into place on the floor and and a guard works the electric lock
it springs open and the guard slides off a side panel
they are stacked one on the other five of them in all cryotubes
people sleeping inside
one by one the tubes are hauled to one side of the room as the second unit is wheeled in
by the end there are ten people sleeping side by side in their tubes in the dark chamber
the scientists meanwhile retire to int
an adjoining chamber with a long glass window looking at the chamber
the last of the guards leaves the chamber and we see the door lock behind them
wren starts pushing buttons
the glass tops of the cryotubes slide open
we see temperature and lifesign gauges begin to change
there is a thick whirring as a part of the ceiling above the tubes lowers lowers and rotates slowly
stuck to the other side of it are ten alien eggs
the ceiling rotates just enough so that they are aimed at the heads of the sleepers
for a moment nothing happens
one of the sleepers eyes flutter slightly
all ten eggs open simultaneously
a huge room used for assemblies and events
it has a chain basketball net set up at one end crude court lines taped to the floor
ripley stands beneath the net with a ball dribbling absently
at the other end are set up tables and folding chairs
the crew of the betty sans elgyn are filing in to eat here
johner spies ripley smiles
johner comes up to ripley
her expression makes it clear how much she enjoys having him in her face
how about a little one on one
she keeps dribbling says nothing
what do you say
get away from me
why should i
because pain hurts
he falters a moment at her quiet threat then johner are you gonna hurt me then
think i might enjoy that
he smiles his ugly smile
she smiles back
she hits him solidly in the chest and he flies back ten feet landing badly on a group of chairs
his mates fly into action christie grabs a standing ashtray
hillard jumps ripley from behind
she throws her off with e chucks the basketball at her hard enough to pop the air out of it
christie swings at her and smashes her right in the face
she arcs back
and right back up at christies throat before he has a chance to react squeezing batting away the ashtray just a trickle of blood coming down her nose johner cames
at her again and she leaps on him throws him to the ground snarling ripley
ripley looks up and four guards are pointing burners at her
wren and gediman behind them
call standing to one side with vriess reacts visibly to the name
everybody is slowly backing off
st just stands with his hands behind his back as if concealing something
call watches in rapt silence
dont lets have a scene
ripley lets go of johner stands
smells i imagine he does
johner barely breathing what the fuck are you
she looks down on him in both senses of the phrase
look around at everyone staring at her
she wipes the bit of blood from under her nose flicks it away
wren to gediman amused social skills less than a hundred percent
the few drops she flicked away sizzle on the floor not eating through but melting a small patch
a large metal box is being wheeled next to an observation pen
soldiers surround it weapons at the ready
not one of them at ease
wren and gediman watch intently
whats the status on the queen
we still havent detected the origin of the reproductive anomalies
but the egg laying stage appears to be over
did we do something wrong
i dont know
i think we covered everything
but these redundancies
a soldier lifts a panel in the pen and then doors to the cage come open automatically
a fullgrown alien suddenly bolts into the pen
the soldier shut it as quickly as humanly possible
father check security status observation pen six
father the voice of the ship replies after a moment in a dulcet comforting tone
pen six secure security systems functional at
now the others
we see various angles of people at night rane in a chamber on the auriga
hillard and elgyn in a slightly more lush one
perez in his quarters
vriess rolling about the aurigals engine room looking it over
christie st just call and johner all playing poker in the mess hall
a sleep cycle is indicated here by the low lighting and the near emptiness of the room
gediman alone is in here writing observations down in a notebook as he watches the pen
inside are three aliens
two of them seem to be hibernating curled up in the corner but the third faces the glass tilting its head and hissing at it
gediman sits right up close to it his face just inches away from the beasts
it draws back its lips opens its mouth
the metallic tongue issues slowly forth dripping with slime
gediman softly fascinated is that a distended externus lingua
or are you just happy to see me
the creature hisses
retracts the tongue
gediman scribbles few notes
something moves in the dark behind him
before he can notice a hand closes on his shoulder
she steps forward eyes locked on the cage
gediman seems only mildly surprised
how did you get in here
beautiful arent they
yes they are
ive been monitoring their interaction
he points at a audiograph by the wall blips and waves interrupting the vibrating line indicating sound
he notices that her hand is still on her shoulder
through ultrasonic soundwaves
sort of like bats
she looks at him
i can hear them
gediman smiling amazing
she runs her hand through the back of his hair gently urging him up off his chair
she pulls him close kisses him
lightly at first then deeply holding his head with both hands
he responds with surprising warmth the kiss drawing out pulling slowly apart
she looks at him smiles
an alien tongue shoots out of her mouth burying itself in his face
as she suddenly awakes eyes wide breathing hard
she has been sleeping we see in the same position she was before squatting in the middle of the room
she looks about her recovering from the nightmare
her breathing slows
with a somewhat fatalistic look she settles back to sleep
christie call st just and johner are still at their all night poker game stacks of bills peanuts and liquor scattered the table
they are in a tense hand the pot impressively high
raise you two hundred
oh fuck you
she throws down her cards takes a swig of johners patented moonshine
it tastes horrible
that takes me down too
uh uh fuck it
to st just what do you got
st just calmly shuffles his cards back into the deck
youll always wonder
johner your deal
deal me out
its not my night
she tries to stand up takes a spill over her chair
the others laugh
jesus johner what do you put in that shit battery acid
just for coloring
st just producing a small vial i got something thatll take the edge off that
call thanks ill walk it off
she stumbles out of the room
johner shuffles the deck
bitches should not play with the boys they will get cleaned out
dealing eight card throwback fuck your sister and the sevens are wild
as soon as she is out of sight call straightens up completely sober
she looks around her and takes off toward the restricted areas
she comes to the door and making sure no one is around star punching in code on the keypad
as call pads silently down it looking for one cell
the cell door opens silently
call hesitates a moment then slips in shutting the door behind her
ripley is sleeping still in the squatting position in the middle of the room
she stares down at ripley a moment
a shadow passes as a guard walks above them call tenses till he is gone
looks back down at ripley still sleeping
call extends her hand flexes her wrist
the meanest lookin stilletto youve ever seen extends from out her sleeve
it gotta be a foot long and sharp enough to shave with
she lifts back her arm the better to punch it through ripleys heart
ripley shifts slightly
her shirt is open enough to show a good portion of the scar
call hesitates staring realization flooding her face
call starts moving back a pace
you gonna kill me or what
theres no point is there
a flick of her wrist and the stilletto whips back up her sleeve
ripley sits up
its already out of you
is it here
is it on board
ripley smiling you mean my baby
call i dont understand
if theyve got it why are they keeping you alive
im the latest thing
those sick fucks
she raises her arm the stilletto gliding out again
i can make it stop
thats all i can offer you
ripley holds her palm up presses it against the point of the blade
what makes you think i would let you do that
ripley pushes her hand out the blade goes right through her palm
she keeps pushing her hand out slowly a good five inches of the blade sticking out the back of her hand before she stops
call stares at her
what are you
ripley ellen lieutenant first class number
ellen ripley died two hundred years ago
ripley pulls her hand back suddenly grimacing at the pain
what do you know about it
ive read morse ive read all the banned histories
she gave her life to protect us from the beast
youre not her
if im not her
what am i
youre a thing
they grew you in a fucking lab
but only god can make a tree
and now theyve brought the beast out of you
ripley smiling not all the way out
its in my head
behind my eyes
i can hear it moving
the smile is gone some real vulnerability showing through
call softens trying a different tack
if theres anything human in you at all help me stop them before this thing gets loose
its already loose
calls expression changes
those words terrify her but shes not sure if ripley means what she thinks
ripley raises her hand at calls head call flinches but ripley stops a few inches away
then touches her forehead gently almost sensually
once the thought
the hope for it
it has found its way
it will come because
man will bring it
bring it forth
you want that
ive come to terms with the fact of it
not so long as theres breath in me
ripley lashes out and grabs calls throat
call swings wit the blade but ripley has her arm pinned before she can connect
ripley squeezes the girls neck
ripley looks at the girl with a world of sadness
calls eyes are pleading terrified
ripley finally lets go and she drops to the ground gasping for air
theyre coming for you
as soon as she can move call scrambles up and heads out
call comes out and before she can move a rifle but hits her the head
she goes down but not out as two guards grab her
wren is with them and three more
i think youre gonna find that this was ill advised
to the men where are her friends
mess hall most of them
sound the alarm
i want them rounded up
being kicked over
elgyn hillard and rane are pushed into the room sleepy and confused
christie st just and johner are all being herded in by soldiers
call is thrown into the group as well
what the fuck is going on here
looks like a doublecross boss
wheres the other one
with the chair
johner to a soldier get your fucking hands off me
do you mind telling me what the fuck youre up to
to a guard get the general
wake him up
look if theres a problem tell me what it is
we can work this out there is no need to get emotional
st just is silent standing in the same position he was when ripley attacked johner
hands behind his back
as elgyn speaks two guns
slip out of his sleeves and fill his hands
they got nothing to do with this wren
elgyn to call to do with what
wren i dont give a fuck
its way too late for that
youre all looking at a firing squad
you hear me
with lighting precision st just raises his hands and blows of the guards away
he takes out a third to his left without even looking that way
one guard gets off a shot with his burner frying rane before hillards elbow knocks his teeth well into his throat
christie tackles the next as johner presses a latch on the bottom of his thermos the top half flies off revealing handle of a gun inside
he grabs it and another guard runs
johner doesnt have time to pull the gun out of the the so he shoots right through it sending the guard flying
alarms flashing red lights
gediman looking in a video monitor
what the fuck
all but one of the guards rush out to investigate
gediman works the surveilliance screen trying to see whats happening when the smoke clears there are two guards still standing
they point their weapons inneffectually
st just a has gun to wrens head and a gun on the guards who are also covered by johner
nice and easy boys
call starts to take off
im gonna finish this
elgyn grabs her by the hair roughly pulls her back
youre going nowhere annalee
the three aliens have picked up the energy
are stalking back and forth like tigers in the dim light of their pen
we see gediman and the guard their backs to us
the aliens stop pacing
one of them to the right looks at the one on the left
something passes between them
they look back at the humans
at each other
they set on the middle alien tearing it apart
it lets out piercing insectile shrieks as they tear it limb from limb
gediman spins in terror the guard bringing up his weapon
gediman hits the lights inside the pen and as they blink to shocking brightness we see the remains of the third alien on the ground as a giant pool its
blood oh god he bolts for the failsafe but its too late as the blood eats all the way through the two aliens dive through the hole
just as gediman hits the button freezing gas fills the chamber but theres nothing to freeze
no no no
he hits another sequence and the door slides open
he rushes in kneels by the hole and looks down
their blood has already eaten through two levels
they could be anywhere
he looks up at the guard and an alien flies up at him through the hole
it was hanging on the ceiling below and it pulls him through before he can breathe a decent scream
the guard just stares shaking
the mexican standoff is getting even more heated
who gives a shit
we have to get out of here
if calls got something going here i want to know what it is
you brought her here
two more guards rush in
johner shoves his gun in wrens mouth
im not fucking with you
christie indicating the dead soldiers boss we got bodies here
it doesnt matter what calls up to were all fucked now
i have to stop him
if i dont well all die
wren pulls his mouth away elgyn tell me what you know
if shes alone in this
johner puts his gun to calls temple now
does anyone want me to make this simple
far away a scream
wren turns slowly in the direction it came from
a technican runs screaming just as an alien leaps on him from behind
the camera rushes away frenzied as the scene to pick up a guard in the next hall firing wildly at the ceiling as an alien dissappears up an airvent
there are three bodies lying dead before us
we see that the aliens have been freed
smoke dead bodies the plexiglass partition to one cage is cracked and open
ripley sits in the dark the noise of chaos just beginning filter in
and she just cant help herself
she is laughing
he is mostly dressed still shaking off sleep
he stands at the command console bringing up visual
everything on the screens is smoke and noise
on one of the screens an alien is briefly visible
perez stiffens at the sight of it
he punches up a different sector
the labs and here is a badly wounded lieutenant
containment is impossible sir
i think they swept the barracks
perez to himself a military strike
after a beat he starts punching in the emergency override codes
its worst here the aliens have taken out a dozen men in their sleep and everyone awake is screaming
one soldier runs for the weapons cabinet an alien hits him from behind and smashes him into it falling in a tumble of guns
over the chaos the emergency lighting comes on floor light like an airplanes indicating the nearest exit
fathers voice is excruciatingly calm emergency
initiate evacuation procedures immediately
this is not a drill
one soldier gets a bead on an alien with his burner fries italong with two of his friends
theyre out of commission but the alien is hurt only momentarily
it bounds forward takes out his face
initiate evacuation procedures
the noise is too far above to be heard down here but fathers droning voice and the emergency lighting are on
vriess wheels slowly into the hall concerned
he spins slowly checking out his surroundings
there is nothing
just the floor lights pulsing in succession towards the exit
vriess follows their lead wheeling out
nothing here either
but vriesss fur is up he moves slowly carefully
and was that a noise
he looks around up at the ceiling
a drop of alien blood is eating through right above him
it drips down and he rolls out of the way just in time back up as the blood plops to the floor eating casually through
men are rushing into one of the lifeboats
they sit facing each other in the tiny vessel and strap themselves in
pere is here hurrying the soldiers in pushing back the few who try to crowd in after
the late soldiers make for the next boat as perez seals the hatch
he hits the eject button and steps back
as the lifeboat fires out of the side of the giant craft
men crowd into this one too its nearly full and an alien suddenly leaps into it
starts feeding on the men strapped down they are screaming
perez runs in as a soldier outside the lifeboat fires his burner hitting the alien the men the controls a shower of sparks as the alien turns about to spring
on the soldier as he rolls in a grenade
the doors shut and and a soldier hits the eject button
the second lifeboat comes shooting out and moments later
the noise of the explosion and of a few inside as well is all around the group
fathers voice still urges evacuaticion to call what have you done
not a goddanm thing
you thought you could control it
we make for the betty
can he walk
he is pointing at rane who nods standing
hillard bettys all the way across the ship
who knows whats in between
call indicating wren he does
one of the soldiers steps forward
distephano to wren sir we have to go
to elgyn let him go
you can have him when were off
they start out dragging wren along
guns still on call and the soldiers
what about vriess
vries enters looking around
he is getting seriously wigged
the lights on the floor still pulse
urging him forward
something stirs in the rafters
coiled about the pipes
vriess stops still a good thirty feet from the beast
strains to see
it starts moving climbing at him upside down on the pipes
vriess starts wheeling himself back away but slowly agonizingly slowly compared to the beast
he turns the corner spins around
the hall is fifty feet long
at the far end a few soldiers running through
seal off that sector
a soldier runs to obey working the door controls
the soldier sees him but the fear on the boys face telegraphs his decision
vreiess starts pumping toward the door
hes strong picking up speed but the alien rounds the corner and bolts after him
vriess cant even look back as the thing gains on him
the door begins to come down the soldier finishing the sequence and running off
vriess rolls face set the alien a few feet behind reaching for him an explosion far away rocks the ship the hall tilted momentarily vriess gets a boost as he
rockets downhill the beast still on him the door closing too low for him to clear
he gets there and slams a lever his chair flattens out to a dolly position his head just clears the closing door as the alien slams into it vriess spinning
out and flying off the chair it tilts landing in a heap next to him
lying still on the ground he listens as the beast slams against the door a few more times then fades off
he reaches up for the chair and from the back of it he pulls out a shotgun
perez is trying to maintain order
he is failing
grabs a corporal
muster a squad to search for survivors
perez slams him to the ground with his fist
an alien leaps out at him from the ceiling
the soldiers scatter perez just leaping out of the way shoot it
a couple of men fire their burners to little effect
one soldier runs up to the action
his head is bloodied his expression vengefully grim
the soldier whips out a pistol private
issue he takes a bead on the thing and the soldier fires pumps three bullets into the beast sends it flying back toward the window
perez is riveted by the sight of angle drops of blood big ones hitting the window
everything seems to move slowly now the alien struggling as the soldier pumps two more bullets into it the other soldiers perez the monster falls and the blood eats through
soldiers are beginning to get it
the window cracks begins to shake as the blood is almost through it
even the soldier who shot the alien has stopped his face frozen in horror at what hes about to accomplish
perez shoves him herds the rest out looking back clear the sector
at the window the blood is almost through men are pouring out of the hall some move down a side hall and slam the door shut behind them but most
are making for the main exit anyway
the blood eats a hole in the window the nearest soldier is sucked back against the window he screams as he is sucked through a hole no bigger than his
still men are falling over each other perez herding them out
a huge cracking sound and perez shuts his eyes
the window explodes outward the air blowing everything int space
debris vehicles men all tangled and dead as they blown out into the black
slam shut instantly one cutting right through a soldier halfway out
gates slam down here as well
foam shoots into them hardening instantly sealing the breached sector
sector five nonfunctional
as the crew moves quickly through
they come to a shut door red lights along it indicating its locked
elgyn to distephano open it
johner puts his gun to the soldiers head
the sectors closed
the hulls been breached
okay which way
well have to go through the holding cells
they turn left entering that leads to the holding cells
the room is big a railing at one end looking over another chamber two flights down
a shut door separates the chamber from the cells
can you get that one open
it comes from the rafters dropping down on elgyn in a heartbeat
he barely has time to scream before it shoots its tongue through the back of his skull
hillard has time
she screams as her lovers brains come out his mouth
the beast leaps at the group scattering them like bowling pins as it claws into one of the guards
everybody else is scrambling for cover
st just tries to escape by running past the beast its tail lashes out tangling his feet and tripping him up his head smashing against a pipe
another guard hits it with the burner it shrieks and lands on him
johner shoots at it but is far too panicked to hit it
call has backed to the far wall she desperately works the controls to open the door
it starts to rise
the door rises fully
ripley stands behind it
call starts back not sure what the woman will do
ripley surveys the scene
the alien burrowing its head into the belly of the guard stops
everyone watches as the two creatures sense each other
the alien hisses
ripley looks away contemplative we see a gamut of emotions cross her face but her posture passive sacrificial
she does not move
everyone watches too afraid to breathe
the alien lunges at her leaping across the room in two bounds
its on her and she spins gpabbing it and hurls it away
it lands in a tangle but is up again in a microsecond jumps at her knocks her back into the room on her its claws digging into her skin piston
tongue at her face inches away
she locks an arm around its slick long head and pulls back we hear its tendons strain snap
call to a guard shoot it
shoot them both
she grabs his gun and burns them both
two less than human screams fill the room as they briefly disentangle thrown apart
the beast recovers first dodging the next blast and going for ripley again
ripley on her back reaches behind her grabs a table leg and with inhuman strength brings the table down on the monsters head
she dives at it as it comes out from under
call shoots as ripley hits the alien theyre both fried as ripleys momentum sends them over a railing and they fall twenty feet the alien lands with a spine snapping
crunch ripley only slightly better
a few crew members rush to look over the railing
christie starts down the spiral staircase to that level
where are you going
the creature rolls back onto ripley grabbing her with its dying strength
her face is rigid with pain and anger as she holds it off
its jaws open dripping shaking
the tongue shoots out and ripley grabs it
a scream wells up in her throat
a totally animal killshriek that she screams victorious as she rips the aliens tongue out of its face
she stands bellows another warrior cry
the crew has gathered near
they watch her awed wary
ripley walks slowly up to them up to call
ripley looks a tad pissed
call tenses maybe wishing she hadnt shot ripley as well
ripley takes calls hand puts the tongue in it
call looks at the dripping souvenier
the pincers at the end still twitching
what the fuck is going on here
what was that thing
are there more of that thing
johner to call make a hell of a necklace
on the upper level kneeling by elgyns body
no tears but terribly quiet
what do we do
same thing we were doing
we get the fuck
what if theres more
lets stay here and let the army guys deal
someone will come
i mean where are the fucking army guys
st just is very calmly looking up at the rafters guns drawn doctor
you know what that thing is
and theres others
the doctor looks around almost guiltily
we are fucked in our pink bottoms if theres thirty of those things
therell be more
everyone looks around at her
she is squatting in the corner facing away from them
in a few hours therell be twice that number
she stands approaches them so who do i have to fuck to get off this boat
you bought your ticket when you killed that thing
are you fucking crazy
she doesnt care if we
christie fiercely you got no authority here call
now secure it
its the first time christie has raised his voice and it has the desired effect
after a silent moment call starts again softly
christie shes not human
wren cloned her because she was carrying an alien in her
she could turn nobody cares about your opinion you bitch you fucking mole shell turn on us
just like that
i dont give a syphallitic fuck whether you people can get along or not
if weve got a wish to live then we work together and that includes bug lady
you cant trust her
i dont trust anyone
cut to int
chamber cellblock a bit later the group is still in the adjoining chamber but looking here into the cellblock where ripley had been
distephano and st just come first guns ready looking about them
they are followed by christie and wren
theres a console in the guards station
we can punch up a diagnostic of the ship and plan a route
to your ship
that likes me fine
he signals for the others to follow everyone moving cautiously
gently lays her coat over elgyns face
johner looks down a moment
via con dios man
call puts ahand on her shoulder but hillard moves away a distrustful look on her face
ripley bringing up the rear watches the whole group with a sort of fascinated detatchment
call looks back at her
ripley smiles coldly
the group makes their way slowly quietly
they approach a bank of elevators but wren points down an adjoining doorway
they are about to go there when the elevator door lights up indicating arrival
the group backs up spreads out
those who can find cover take it
the elevator doors open
it is too dark inside to see suddenly sparks fly from the broken overhead in the elevator and a figure appears in the light
everyone jolts about to fire
before they realize it is who sits in his chair a shotgun in each hand eyes wide
twitchier than they
vriess mock casual hey whatchyou guys doing
thought you were toast for certain
youve seen that fucking thing
wren suspiciously where were you
i was down by what do you mean
i was in maintenance checking out your oxidation systems
docs got a bug up his ass cause calls a mole and he thinks were a conspiracy
vriess looking at call shes a what
a fucking spy
vriess looks hit harder by that information than anyone
we gota mission here people
lets keep moving
a hologram of the ship appears above the screen
it looks a solid as the ship itself except that parts of it occasional break themselves down to show interiors
the group looks it over
parts of the ship are simply not there the sections around those holes red
wren points them out
weve had hull breach by the lifeboats here on level five and down jesus right by the engine room
were very lucky
st just sarcastically lucky we
what about the betty
the dock seems to be intact
then we head for it
can we track those fucking things
we could get to the betty and they could be all over it
are you toting a better fucking idea
all of the activity seemsto have been in the aft sector by the barracks
theres no reason to suppose theyd move they wont
everybody looks at her
theyve got new bodies to work on
theyll stay close
if they send anybody out itll be here
how long does that take
the process has accelerated something to do with the cloned cells
faster we get from here to there the better
with all the devils of hell in between
well if we want to make decent time i say we ditch the cripple
to vriess no offense
vriess giving him the finger none taken
nobodys left behind johner
not even you
her voice is quiet mourning still thick in it
nobody backtalks her
so whats our route
im trying to figure it
we can cut through the labs but were blocked on both sides here im not sure sir
there is the lift
distephano works the console and the hologram splits the route hes indicating revealed
they run straight from the top of the ship down to engineering
no stops but if we can get in the shaft theres a maintenece access tunnel here points to the center of the shaft that runs above level one deck
take us right to the dock
i dont have the code for the access tunnel door
i can override
indicating the route then we head through the labs then down to the kitchen
to the bottom of the shaft
up through the tunnel and onto the ship
is unloading additional ammo from inside his chair
he toss one of his shotguns to hillard
they never check the chair
he pulls out a grenade launcher
its so compact its almost cute cradled one handed like an uzi
she looks around and he tosses it to her
the gesture is not acconmpanied by any show of warmth
try not to shoot your foot off
you people should know we
wont shoot at the windows doc
the aliens they bleed molecular acid
thats right i saw that
so did i
we cant shoot them
fuck that im shooting them
this is a big vessel and for the most part we should be okay
but if we get anywhere near the outer hull and start strafing them
he indicates the hologram the sections of the ship missing
everyone gets it
if were clear then lets get on it
well go by twos were moving
the ship is moving
can feel it
i dont feel shit what do you mean theyre piloting this fucking thing
this ship has stealthrun even if we were moving theres no way she could feel it
call shes right
call is working the computer now
the ships been going since the attack
its uh its standard i think
if the ship takes on any serious damage it autopilots back to homebase
call to wren pissed you were planning to let us know this
what is homebase
oh you bastard
im not going to that fucking slum
if those things get to earth itll be
ripley not very concerned
thats not our problem
weve got to blow the ship
we dont have to do anything till we get off it
how long till we get there
then thats what we got
dont you understand what this means
i understand my hide
and i like it on me
to ripley what are you called ripley
you mind taking point
she moves to the head of the line and they start
as they progress
everyone with a gun has it at the ready
ripley is a few yards in front
she stops sniffs
johner moves up next to her
youve come up against these things before
so what did you do
he lags behind a bit thrown
that wasnt really what i wanted to hear
distephano points to a door
and ripley leads them in
as ripley enters we can see that this lab has been trashed
ripley surveys the wreckage calmly keeps moving
as the others file in their horrified expressions lend contrast to her lack of one
among the debris are three bodies chests exploded outward
lets keep moving
the door to the next chamber is ajar
christie and vriess in then st just then ripley
something leaps at ripley from out of the shadows a metal bar slams into her side throwing her off balance
st just and christie spin weapons up and almost shoot the figure cowering in the corner
everyone else rushes in as he swings the bar before him eyes wild with terror
get away from me
drop the rod man
but the energy is out of him
the rod falls with a hollow clatter
he looks weakly from face to face
whats going on
st just looks at his name stitched in his coveralls
whats going on is that were getting the fuck off this ghost ship
where am i
was in cryo on the way to xarem work crew for the nickel refinery
i wake up i dont understand
i saw something
look you come with us
its dangerous here
cocks her head
were not leaving anyone on this boat
hes got one
i can smell it
shit i dont want one of those things birthing anywhere near my ass
its a bad risk
we cant just leave him
i thought you came here to stop them from spreading
call to wren torn isnt there a process cant you stop it
weve got no time for that
i couldnt do it here
the labs torn apart
st just quietly i could do him
painless back of the head
might be the best way
theres gotta be another way
if we freeze him they all look at him a bit sheepishly
a foreign element that
ripley steps in front of the doctor
theres a monster in your stomach
they indicating the smugglers hijacked your cryotube and sold you to him indicatingwren and he put an alien in you
in a few hours it will punch its way through your chest and youll die
purvis is wide eyed stunned
after a moment he stammers who are you
im the monsters mother
she starts heading out of the chamber
call turns to the others
he comes with us
we can freeze him on the betty and get the doctor to remove it later
since when are you in fucking charge
since you were born without balls
ease off people
christie to purvis herding him along come with us
you might even live
get twitchy on me and you will be shot
they move out
still in the same general area still looking around every corner
its been too quiet too long and the group senses that they move into its in bad shape so we might not recognize it as the chamber the queen was
he is loooking into the room
the queen was kept in
a residue of slime is all thats left here
beyond the queens chamber is another observation room
wren indicates that they have to go through
suddenly a burner blast fires at them just missing them as they duck
they hear more blasts not aimed at them and screams
its on me
ripley looks up and can just see two aliens making short work of a group of soldiers
call instantly moves to attack and ripley grabs her holds tight
weve got to help them
you bitch let go of me
she does and call rises
the noise is gone
what she can see of the soldiers is parts
she is shaking at the vision when an alien rises in front on the soldiers
call ducks back down terrified
christie hisses at her
you want to get yourself killed then you run solo
at least two
think they heard us
fine by me
yeah let em come
any other way around
wren shakes his head
we cant just walk in there
wren thinking no
no but they can
the cages all have failsafes
get em to come to us and i can freeze em
wren goes over to the failsafe button
the others look out at the aliens
calls out hey
the aliens react start for the cage
four of them
they reach the edge of it and stop
look around at each other
but go nowhere
theyre not coming
fresh meat here
they know its a trap
what do we do
shoot the fucking things
theres too many and we dont have the angle
give em a reason to go in there
throw somebody in
do we want to live
give em her
she indicates call who looks around nervous at the lack of protest about this idea
ripley points at rane
or the skinny one it doesnt matter
we cant resist the smell of meat
fuck im with her
give em annalee
now hold on you people are insane
now youre not exactly in the club either soldier
people start pointing guns at each other
fuck you all im not dying for you
ripley grabs her
looks at the others
do you want to live or not
to call it wont hurt long
call terrified noo
ripley to wren wren hits the button just as three aliens are bounding across the cage theyre almost to the posse people screaming scrambling when the freezing gas hits turning
the beasts to statues
the forth one sees this and flees but st just stands and put four bullets in it from forty yards
it slumps over
everyone is silent stunned
vriess realizes fear
thats how they knew it was a trap
they couldnt smell the fear
ripley looking at call so i gave them some
johner gleefully son of a bitch
he pops up and fires at the frozen aliens they explode into fragments
gildihg through space passing jupiters moons with dazzling speed
ripley and call are on point
ripley looks down the hall
call is staring at her and ripley can feel the girls eyes on her back
ripley without looking around did you think i was going to
feed you to them
i think you still might
she may be right
i want to live
and you dont care about anything else
call bitterly i guess youre more human than i thought
why did you come here
to kill you remember
after a beat because somebody has to
well its not me
i did my time
now i just want to
she stops dead staring at a door
cloning storage facility is written on it
stencilled beneath that is numbers
tries the door which opens
thats not the way
ripley we got no time for sightseeing
ripley is looking down at her arm at the tattooed on it
she looks at call
looks back at wren
she stands a moment staring before proceeding through it
call stands in the doorway others crowding behind her
every face registers the horror of what they are seeing but none more so than ripleys numbers one through seven
the first failed efforts to clone ripley
they are lined up like museum exhibits or side show freaks
here is the fetal ripley the fetal alien visible through its translucent chest
in a jar
here is a prematurely old diseased ripley withered blue skin cling to collapsed bones
here is an attempt to separate the alien and grow it without the host boneless bubbling tissue weak and useless mouth rigored in midmew
each one more horrifying than the last and the last the worst of all
ripley approaches and stares at number seven
a complete mixture of alien and human dna
a tortured disgusting hybrid half ripley half nightmare
hooked up wires and machines it lies on the tilted table its head nearly level with ripleys as she finally approaches it
when it opens its eyes they are hers
it tuns its head ever so slightly to look at her
ripley cannot even speak
she begins to shake slightly looking at number seven
ripleys eyes go saucered as it speaks speaks out of nothing resembling a mouth
ripley staggers back a step shaking now
this is too much to bear
ripley turns slowly still in a fever dream
call cocks the grenade launcher with a loud crack
her eyes meet ripleys
call tosses it to ripley as the crew steps back and even a catches it ripley fires a grenade chugging to the end of room and bursting in fire and
noise she fires another tissue and steel exploding into flame she turns to number seven hand shakes momentarily
and she fires the poor creature dissolving in a cloud of flame
freezing gas jets fill the room extinguishing potential spread but the heart of the firestorm continues to rage in the chamber
she backs out the crew waiting for her outside
the launcher falls loudly to the ground
ripley turns to wren her face rigid with pain
wren backs up a step looking around him for protection that the others have no thought of providing
dont do it
weariness suffusing her expression
dont do what
the tension pases
wren breathes a little sigh of relief
call punches him across the jaw his head whipping around as collapses to the ground
call starts down the hall not even looking at him
dont do that
feeling his jaw wren actually smiles at the absurdity of all this
its kind of winning
christie helps him up
had it coming doc
johner looks in at the burning lab
whats the big deal
fucking waste of ammo
lets move before anything comes to check out the noise
we go down from here
christie to vriess we got to lose the chair
kawlang maneuver all right
vriess is pulling a coil of cords from the chair
just like old times
a hatch opens
ripley drops down surveys the scene
quiet dark empty
ripley comes up call behind her
ripley sniffs listens
closes her eyes
after a beat she starts further in and call motions for others to follow
slowly they make their way down the corridor
ripley cal hillard guns drawn
bringing up the rear is christie toting a shotgun
he turn slowly alert and we see that vriess is strapped to his back facing the other way also with a shotgun
call to ripley that lab
cant imagine how that must feel
ripley looks down
the floor here is covered with a foot or so of dark water
ripley steps into it moves up a few paces
the others gingerly follow
vriess is facing the back
he looks up
the cooling tanks
they must have blown during the trouble
we see the round underbelly of two huge tanks
there are gaping twisted holes in them
the nasties couldnt have done it could they
he is at the front with ripley and call where the water is waste deep
he looks down at a stairwell just the top of the railing visible above the murky water
theres no other way
were at the bottom of the ship
some of the worst damage is down here
most of the sections are sealed off
theres the noncoms entrance back there but its flooded too and its a longer run
were gonna have to do it this way
its just through the kitchen then up maybe seventy feet
i dont like it
whats to like
christie to vriess you ready to get wet partner
you sure about the distance
no locked doors
its an open hall
just keep left when you hit the bottom of the staircase
he flips caps over the barrel of the gun slides a panel over the digital readout
the burner is ready to go watertight
distephmo to st just you should secureyour weapons
st just holds up his two guns
these are disposables
they can take it
i heard about those
how many rounds
split points give you a good hole even at the smaller caliber
theyre big with hitters
cause you throw em away after the job
nobody likes throwing away a weapon theyre attached to
he smiles at di stephano who looks a little uneasy about the turn the conversation has taken
he joins the others who are getting ready to dive
do i have to tell everyone to take a deep breath
a couple of the guys smile
christie do me a favor
when we hit the surface on the other side
christie laughing youll be forever blowing bubbles
he counts down the two suck in enormous breaths and dive right behind call and ripley
one by one the entire crew slips down into the black water
its all underwater
visiblity is poor
the crew move swiftly and gracefully down the stairs and into the kitchen
in here its a tad labyrinthian and the size of the room it darker
wren heads straight for the other end
safety is a good fifty feet away
they are tense concentrated
swimming past dark spaces
anything could be hiding here
johner looks about him very nervous
he looks behind
three aliens are right behind him
panic blows half the air out of his mouth as he swings around and fires at them tags one as the other two swim off into shadows with horrible ease
ripley all the way to the stairs sees
she hurries the others past her
they swim frantically for safety hillard wren christie and vriess
rane is coming along and alien hands grab at him from the darkness pull him into it
hillard fires in that direction johner bringing up the rear still firing at the third one wounding it but not scoring killshot
call is swimming up ther staircase the growing light above indicating the surface
she is almost to it when she is in the web
a net of translucent alien goo it is spread just six inche below the surface
call struggles the goo sticking to her shes running out of air as wren and christie enconter the same thing they all try to tear through it but they are
ripley looks back as the last of the crew is passing her aliens close behind
she looks up to see the situation ab and quickly makes for the surface but an alien grabs her foot holding her down
now she is running out of air kicks at it it lets go
the others are fighting call pops her stilletto and cuts through but its tough she still cant get her head up di stephano off to the side is drowning
takes in a huge mouthful of water and begins thrashing
ripley swims past everyone and grabs the hole call cut pulls it apart with a mighty heave she glides up through just breaks the surface she takes in a huge
gasp of air facehugger ripley goes back under pulling at the thing as others break the surface
wren comes up and a hugger leaps right at him but call nails it in four shots
christie and vriess break surface and both begin firing back to back in a circular sweep
they decimate a number of eggs ripley pulls the face hugger with all her might it comes off its fingers singeing the sides of her face leaving marks like warpaint
worse its probing fleshy member pulls last of her throat thrashing horribly
in utmost disgust ripley pulls it apart
and the three aliens are most of the crew has gotten up out of the water
christie holding a facehugger inches from his face others screaming taking a bead on it
the bloodll burn you
he does and johner nails it in midflight
hillard and johner pull di stephano out of the water but he is not breathing
ripley is grabbed by an alien and st just comes up behind her and shoots it
they swim up and away from the spreading lethal bloodpool
they come up out of the water and an alien rises right behind them
everyone who can shoots it
it falls back into the water
they set a goddamn ambush
give me that
he pulls the burner off di stephanos body even as call is giving him mouth to mouth
johner flips the gun open and fires at the water the whole thing smoking and sizzling with the electrical charge
we hear an alien wail bubble from below the surface
johner grinning feverishly okay
everybody out of the pool
lets get the fuck
di stephano sputters back to life
ripley picks him up with one hand hillard to wren which way
he takes off the others following
up through the lift shaft
he stops at a pair of sliding doors starts working the panel
ripley come up to the doors and pulls them apart with a grunt
hes refering to the noise and shadow of approaching aliens
she herds them into the shaft
it goes down about four stories and up seemingly forever
enough room for or three elevators one of which is two stories below
he starts climbing
its not that hard there are ladders in each shaft section
call comes up behind him
ripley and others pair off on other ladders
they climb fast theyre three stories up before the aliens begin pounding on the metal door it buckles under their might
still pounding one alien gets its head in looks up hisses pulls it out
wren comes to a cralwspace ledge
he climbs on
set back a few feet from the shaft is a small maintenance access door
works the keypad beside it as call climbs up behind him
the aliens smash through the door one of them sailing across the shaft to grab a pipe on the other side
instantly four of them are swarming up the walls moving much faster on pipes and ridges than the humans on ladders
on one of the aliens a facehugger crawls constantly moving about on the adult aliens head like a frightened spider
she hands him her gun and without hesitation he shoots her through the she flies back and down the shaft lands hard on an elevator six stories below
eyes wide and empty
he fires up at wren but wren has punched in the code and slipped through the opening door
ripley leaps through the air and grabs the ledge hauling herself up just in time to see the door shut
the lock lights turn red
she slams against the door but to no avail
the aliens are getting closer
st just the closest to the bottom suddenly lets go of the ladder
his knees hooked over a rung he drops hangs up side down his guns filling his hands
he blows several holes in the nearest alien
ripley is furious maybe surprised just how so
suddenly an alien rises over the ledge its not three feet away from her and she screams hurls herself at it and they both go flying off into space they
hit the wall on the other side they fall
ripley grabs a pole it practically tears her arm out of her socket but she holds on the alien isnt so lucky it plummets unable to find puchase
we see it fall past the unmoving body of call
as the facehugger clamps onto it
pushes off a bit two digits probing calls nostrils
sensing no breath the thing scurries away to find a better host
another alien is fast approching christie and vriess
vriess frantically tries to reload
its on us
christie turns aims vriess grabs the ladder as christie fires but the alien is too close it grabs christie spurting blood all over him
he screams lets go of the ladder vriess takes the weight of both as christie fires again the alien flying off and down the shaft
we gotta go
the last alien suddenly starts scurrying back down after his brothers
were locked in
how far to the next door
all the way
then we climb
they start moving as fast as they can
vriesss to christie you just hang on man
ill get us there
he starts climbing up impressively fast considering the burden hanging from his back
johner to ripley are they going for reinforcements
fucked if i know
and climb the minutes stretching out still no door
ripley easily ahead of the rest
finally i think i see the door
purvis exhausted great
vriess is having increasing trouble
hillard notices him lagging behind and why
vriess is moving very quickly considering
but the effort is becoming too much
johner scrambles down next to vriess
he checks the pulse in christies neck
refusing to hear it vriess struggles to climb further
well get him to medlab
just a little while
johner looks over at hillard
without saying a word she pull out a good sized hunting knife flicks it open
she slices through the cord holding them together and christies body falls free
vriess shuts his eyes feeling it
angle down the shaft there is silence as christies body drops down the black abyss until from up the shaft next to where he fell we see two aliens fuck
hillard looks up the shaft
how much further
too fucking far
they start to climb but the aliens are making much better time
a loud clacking sounds from the bottom of the shaft
a few of them look down
the aliens are still coming but suddenly the lift passes them heading up at high speed
they can work the elevators
is there anything fucking else we should know about them
hes addressing this at ripley but shes as puzzled as the rest of them
the lift comes up to them stops suddenly as emergency brake is flipped
they wait guns ready
out of the hatch pops call not especially dead
a moment of stunned silence then they all jump on top of the lift
call drops back down inside
an alien comes up level with the lift prepares to jump
st just shoots the shit out of it
where are the others
call flips the brake off and the lift shoots up
she is holding her jacket closed around her chest wound but it doesnt seem to bother her particularly much
everybody holds on as the lift flies up the shaft
call waits for the signal to stop and an alien punches through the bottom of the lift
call yells as it gets its head and an arm through clawing for her
we see the other half of the alien clinging to the lift
ripley sees the door approaching stop
call hits the emergency button and the lift stops halfway in front of the door giving both ripley and call access
bu the alien is still grabbing for her ripley pries open the doors again the crew pouring out into the hall
ripley follows jumps down and opens the lift doors the alien hisses at ripley as she pulls call out the alien grabs calls ankle but ripley wrenches her free
they roll out but the alien is still fighting pulling itself inside the lift
ripley grabs hillardls shotgun
levels it at the cables holding the lift
the lift plummiets the alien still halfway in
it shoots down the shaft picking up the second alien on its way down neither beast able to get its bearing and get out of the way as the lift
smashes into the bottom of the shaft crushing both the aliens to jelly
johner triumphantly sticks his head in the shaft
eat that fuckneck
they all breathe hard exhausted before they can muster for the next stretch
call stands with her back to them
baby am i glad to see you
i thought dickbag took you out for sure
are you hurt
you got body armour on
ripley isnt buying
you were gunshot
ripley spins her around
call stares at ripley sullenly a small trickle of milky white fluid comes from her nostril
ripley looks down
wren has indeed made a messy hole here but where blood and bone should be there is a tangle of synthorganic wiring
to state the obvious a robot
calls a goddam sythetic
son of a bitch
little annalees just full of surprises
ripley quietly i should have known
couldnt smell this one out
no i mean
all that crap about being human theres no one so zealous as a born again
vriess to call youre an lm arent you
is that it
leave me alone
her voice shocks her more than anyone her vocal track slip affected by the wounds
the voice is a shade slow and echoes strangely
call bitterly yes
that explains a lot
yriess to ripley the latest and best
they were supposed to revitalize the synthetic industy
instead they buried it
ripley looks at the girl
they were too good
overrode their own behavioral inhibitors
didnt feel like being told what to do
the government ordered a recall
always heard there were a few that got out alive but man
i never thought id see one
johner starts laughing
doing fucking nickel and dime border runs selling second hand junk to the farm belt
and were carrying the most expensive piece of contraband in the system
purvis getting anxious its great shes a toaster oven
can we leave now
vriess tries to touch calls wound
let me see
call pulls away
yeah get your socket wrench vriess
maybe she just needs an oil change
they start off again johner and st just bringing up the rear cant believe i almost fucked the thing
yeah like youve never fucked a robot
letting distephano lead
where are we
the chapells up here not much else
can we get to the ship
well were a ways out of the way but i think we can get through to the garden
from there its down a few levels its do able
what if the fucking doctor gets there first
its a good point
they have reached an access door
debris blocks the way
through the wall
well have to get one of these panels off
itll take a while
to vriess you got tools
yeah but no torch
fucking blow the door
assface were on the top of this thing
pointing to the ceiling thats hull
what about wren
if he gets in the computer he can really fuck us around
we have to get in too
theres no access console on this level
wed have to backtrack
and i dont have the security access that wren does anyway
ripley turns to call
shes a damn well talking machine
theres another way
just tell her to access it on remote
shit thats right
any of the new model droids can access the mainframe
just by blinking
no time to get coy annalee
i burned my modem drive
we all did
you can still patch in manually
you know that
call looks over at the group staring at her
she knows she doesnt have a choice
theres ports in the chapel
to the others you get started on that wall
ripley and call enter the small room
ripley sits in one of the pews pulls out a bible
it somewhat resembles a newton under the leather flap is a screen reading
ripley pulls out the cord from the bibles port holds it up dont make me do this
dont make me make you
i dont want to go in there
get over it
your insides are liquid
its not real
you can blow the ship
before it reaches earth
kill them all
just give us time to get out first
that convinces call
she pulls up her sleeve and begins
pushes a part of her forearm just below the crook of her elbow
it has a spring release catch and a small panel rises up with two computer ports on it
she takes the cable from ripley and plugs it in
it looks almost like shes mainlining heroin
she cocks her head
she reaches in her chest reconnects some tubes
she twitches then shuts her eyes
she begins speaking very rapidly eyes still shut
breach in sector seven sector three sector nine unstable engines operating at eighty six percent forty six minutes until earthdock
her voice has a slight mechanical quality as she rattles this off
her eyes open
we burned too much energy i cant make critical mass
i cant blow it
then crash it
as the crew works at getting the wall panel off
ground level recalibrated
forty one minutes until impact
try to clear us a path to the ship
tracking movement in sublevels six through nine
video is down
attempted rerouting nonfunctional wait partial visual in waste tank unauthorized presence
emergency override on
console v level one
like herself its wren
hes almost at the betty
and how do you feel about that
wren is holding his hand to the scanner just as call described
the red light turns green and we hear the locks the door crack open
emergency override validated
the door begins to rise
looking around him wren waits to through
the door grinds to a halt still too low to climb under
the lights go out only the faintest glow coming from various instrument panels
wrens expression drains
father reboot systems on v authorization starling
wren looks about him beginning to sweat
did the aliens do this
father locate power drain report
call on the system fathers dead asshole
wren spins in shock at the sound of calls voice
it s everywhere around him
she has downloaded her vocal matrix place of fathers
shes not just speaking over a pa she is the pa
the door slams back down locks clack into place
the doors behind him open up emergency lighting pulsing along toward him
intruder on level one
all aliens please proceed to level one
wren is freaking
he turns back down the corridor looking about him wildly
call pulls the cord out of her port
you got a mean strak
that should hold the fuck
this as her voice track slips even more
she works the wires in her cheest trying to fix it
let me see dont touch me
ripley backs off
you must think this is pretty funny
but im finding a lot of things funny lately
and im not sure they are
why do you go on living
how can you stand it
how can you stand
not so hard
not much choice
at least theres part of you thats human
look at me
she looks at the hole in her chest the white and sticky fibers
her voice is at its slowest here low and eerie
its a mechanical problem but it sounds just like despair
do you dream
we have neural processors that run through
when i sleep i dream about it
all around me
i used to be afraid to dream but im not anymore
because no matter how bad the dreams get
when i wake up its always worse
i guess were almost there
he exits again
call finishes fiddling with her internal wiring
we hear her voice slip back to normal as she says lets get going
as they come one by one through the wall
not far now
god im so tired
yeah well well sleep when were dead
ripley follows him through
dont count on it
the rest of them come through and walk into the garden runs nearly half a mile straight across and then down on a terraced slope
everywhere are different kinds of plants trees vegetable plants exotic and experimental hybrids
access paths crisscross the beds
its huge the single biggest space on the ship
yet the low ceiling laticed with grow lamps now dim in nightcycle and prodigeous undergrowth make it labyrinthian almost claustrophobic
from where the crew is they can barely see where it slopes down
whats this fucking deal
this supplies most of the food for the unit
vriess holding a lucious ripe pear you guys got something against spam
and theres some lab work here too
at the other end
runs down to the by the waste tanks
we can get to the dock from there
ripley is holding her head
she shuts her eyes
what is it
ripley shakes it off
she looks out at the jungle they have to cross
we should get moving
check it out
he has come upon a small loading truck a sort of platform jeep
vriess checks it out takes a huge bite of his pear
he hauls himself up into it
everybody piles onto the back flatbed just a foot or so off the ground and just big enough to hold everyone but vriess call and ripley who pushes into the
quickly and quietly people
ripley stares unconprehendingly at the controls for a momen till call flips on the ignition
the jeep pulls out
its electric so it emits just a low hum as she takes it at a good clip toward the other side
the access paths are just a bit wider than the jeep itself plants rising tall all around them
ripley concentrates on driving
the pass through as section of wheat then of corn
as they come to another section the crews expressions change to one of pleased disbelief
you gotta be fucking me
is this real
so this is what heaven looks like
we see they have driven into a healthy section of cannabis plants growing ten feet high
the car screeches to a halt
ripleys at a crossroads of sorts
hillard looking at the plants i always wondered where the military got its funding
an alien shoots out of the brush and lands on hillard everyone screams ripley slams her foot on the pedal the jeep peels out as more emerge from the brush
get it off meeeaaaaaagghre
it bores into her head before st just can blow it away
its head exploding in fragments of bone and sizzling blood as it falls away from the jeep hillards body still clutched in arms
another leaps out at them but the jeep is going a good clip and it misses
the crew peppering it with bullets
they look about them guns ready
something runs parallel to them in the plants
two more run on top of the grow lamps pacing them as well
one drops down ripley swerves out of the way driving in the plants
they are varied exotic and there are aliens behind half of them
the crew blasts away all around them ripley drives a drunkards path through the brush avoiding trees that dot the scape
an alien drops onto the hood another grabs the side vries takes out the first blowing it off but the second grabs johner he goes flying over the side
dropping his gun
st just is too preoccupied with his own problems on the othe to see that johner is being dragged the alien still clutching onto him
shots bang out ripping into the alien which lets go
johner looks up to see purvis holding johners gun
johner drags himself back on
one jumps down onto st just tears a good chunk out of his midsection before he dusts it
another alien jumps on the hood just as the jeep sails over first ledge of the terraced slope comes down hard enough knock it off sails over the next the
crew can barely hang on as the jeep crashes down slope after slope
ripley swerves back onto the road the jeep sliding over onto the steps beside it rocking violently as they shoot down the remainder of slope the aliens close on their
still blasting away at the beasts the crew is able to put little distance between them as they come to the end of the garden
here it divides into three sections all open halls with access for the jeep
disteprmo looking over left
she swerves left the jeep bouncing into the hall where windows running along either side look out onto black space
ripley drives as far as she can till a staircase going fills her vision too steep for the jeep
she slams on brakes
the jeep spinning out and coming to a halt
the crew piles out di stephano grabbing vriess
at the other end of the hall the aliens can be seen approaching
the crew blasts at them the aliens blood splattering the narrow hall
eating into the walls
call ship warning
distephano indicating the steps down here
they start down all but st just
he gets out of the jeep with difficulty
looks down at his wound
johner looks around to see him still standing atop the steps st just
come on man
st just looks down at the wound
back at johner
he walks calmly away towards the aliens
he looks at the appraching aliens
a moment then the crew takes off
st just takes a handful of pills pops them into his mouth
only the slightest grin suffuses his face as he waits for the aliens
they close on him and he raises his guns
the crew runs full out
we have to get out of the sector
he points at a door thats down two flights and across the hall
the aliens close and st just fires blasting away with bot guns
aliens writhe on the floor before him still they cover the bodies of their brothers still he fires call ship monotones of warning in sharp contrast to the chaos st
just fires until both guns are empty
in one smooth motion he drops them both and jerks his wrists and two more disposable guns fly into his palms and he blasts away eating through the hull
desperately racing for the door
firing with quiet glee
the first of them are through the door
angle st just the aliens are getting closer but still he mows them down both his guns click spent
warning and boom
the hall bursts open everything explodes into space the wind rushes out as boom
the whole garden sector rips open sucked out as is the last to get out but the pressure change sucks her she flies backwards the section door coming down just
in time as she slams into it the door closing fully as she falls lack of pressure sucks at the door itself it creaks and be inward slightly but it holds
the others have exited into the next hall
theyve been tossed about but not as badly
call stops runs back to ripley helps her up
ripley is dazed the door hit the back of her head solidly
can you walk
ripley i think i
im not fucking carrying you ripley doesnt even hear her something else drowns call out
ripley puts her hands over her ears
i can hear them in the hive
were on the hive
i can hear them
shes in pain
they crash up through the floor panels six of them surrounding the two women
call can barely spin before ripley grabs her and hurls her fifteen feet down the corridor out of harms way
the aliens close on ripley
she struggles but shes still weak
one slams her onto the ground call recovers looks back at ripley as the aliens drag her unconscious body back down under the floor
dark cramped and already covered with a hardening layer of resin
skittering insectile motion at one end heralds the aliens as two of them crawl rapidly along
the third craw upside down the semiconscious ripley draped over its chest if she were awake and out
vf her mind she could be kissin the beast
her eyes flutter open but she is obviously still groggy
alien head dark tunnel passing beneath
scuttling through a small maze the aliens come out into a vast dark chamber entirely encrusted with alien goo
air vent opens about three quarters of the way up the chamber
the aliens pour out and imediately scuttle up carrying ripley to the top of the chamber
they circle her and begin secreting resin spinning a web around her
the resin comes out of ther backs in spits and globs
it isnt pleasant and ripley struggles feebly as they begin to cocoon her
the crew piles through it on their way to the loading dock
call brings up the rear still looking back regretfully
she hesitates and purvis takes hold of her arm
we got to be moving miss
best gift you can give her right now is a quick death
its not right
ive been saying that all day we need your help
a moment more and she heads out with him
the aliens have finished webbing ripley and climb away
when it is done she finds herself basically hung from the ceiling her legs encased and glued with glistening strands to the roof
she hangs therefore at an angle looking down on the chamber
and so it is with her as she swims to full consciousness we get our first real look at where we are
there are no less than ten people strung up exactly as ripley is encircling the chamber and all looking some forty feet down at the queen
lying on her back at the bottom of the chamber belly swollen and distended
she is herself partially cocooned strapped down to the at the edge of a black pool of blood and ichor
her head moves slowly back and forth in delierium of pain
there are a four or five aliens tending her spinning goo around her vomiting blood onto her belly
they might be serving her or imprisoning her
both in fact
there is one thing missing from this tableau
ripley softly no eggs
multiple reproductive systems
ripley turns slowly to see the person next to her
its gediman looking wane and haggard
he may be speaking to her but he stares straight ahead his eyes glowing with near insanity
complete asexual reproductive cycle self impregnating we found six different sets of ovaries in her
egg laying is the first cycle immature
redundancies redundancies shell bring forth legion
they didnt impregnate you
now he looks at her regret and glee at what has happened battling for his expression
theyve just been draining me
she looks down to see as blood from various wounds seeps slowly past his toes dripping into the pool
a keening shriek comes out of the queen as her limbs begin thrashing
the aliens around her back off slightly
the bulge in her belly starts moving
ripley starts struggling with her bonds terror and determination in her
im getting out of here
goddamnit im getting the fuck out of here
he looks at her the last glimmerof his sanity sinking beyond the horizon
dont you want to see what happens next
the crew rushes in heads for the betty
how long till we can get airborn
ill need call to patch in to the ship again open the hatch
we hit atmo in a few minutes only gonna make it harder
they all run on board and head for the cockpit
distephano deposits vriess in a wheelchair
johner take purvis to the freezer
nap time buddy
a gunshot and purvis goes flying blood spurting out of his shoulder johner draws but wren emerges from the shadows too fast
wren grabs call and very carefully holds his gun to her back right below her shoulderblades
fuck with me and i put a bullet where her brain is
johner stands uncertain
take their weapons
begging your pardon sir but eat my fuck
distephano aims at wren
wren backs up a step
drop it or we all die together
heaped in the corner purvis suddenly jerks forward
his eyes go wide
ripley is frantically trying to pull at her bonds
its just beginning to work
but the noise in here is getting worse the aliens franitcally agitated as the queens belly begins moving more violently
shrieks and ripley does as well from effort or sympathy it is hard to tell as the queens belly pops open
blood shoots everywhere burning into the walls
and all the screaming stops
the movement stops
even ripley stops
something emerges from the wound
an alien to be sure but nothing weve seen so far its forelegs arch out of its back like spiders legs its back legs set on enormous haunches thick and
its head is long eyeless like the others but along its white expanse red veins coming out of the skin and running like thick black hairs to the back
it has retracted pincers at the side of head that come out when its tongue does
its much bigger the the others nearly the size of the queen herself
and its bone white
he is crying with revelatory joy
ripley is not
grimacing the sight and smell of the new beast she begins pulling again at her bonds
one of the soldiers at the other end of the room from ripley wakes up
dangling uselessly at his side is a rifle the real deal not a burner
he screams in uncomprehending horror
the newborn stops tilting its head it leaps up to the ceiling in a second quick and effortless as a monstrous flea
leaps again and lands on the screaming soldier gripping his sides with its four forelegs as he screams lustily
pincers swing out and pin either side of his head
his eyes go wide as its tongue shoots into his throat
stays there and we watch it drain the blood from his body
we can see it see its stomach swell red tinged as his body goes blue and slack
his rifle drops into the black pool
gediman stares transfixed and it lands on him
johners gun drops to the floor
everyone backs off
the fucking robot is going to plug back into the auriga and land it according to standard operational procedure
no shes not
youre fucking nuts
you still want to bring those things back to earth
have you been paying any attention today
i can handle the animals
fucking shoot me
and purvis launches from the corner screaming jumps on wren wren gets off a couple of shots nails distephano in the face
the soldier drops like a sack
the other shots hit the ship call dives for cover as purvis slams his fist across wrens face wren fires again and jo is on the ground rolling grabbing his
gun purvis is a man possessed
he grabs wrens gunhand and smas it against an instrument panel bone cracking audibly as wren drops the gun
blood blooms in his chest
everybody stops mesmerized
wren drops to his knees going for the gun and purvis grabs him from behind pulls him so that the back of wrens head is against his chest
purvis jerks again
it takes wren a moment to understand whats happening
they both scream
then alien bursts out of purviss chest straight into wrens skull
everyone else is still frozen
then the little critter bursts out of wrens face flying straight at vriess
cut to int
waste tank ripley tears one of her arms free as the newborn feeds beside her
gediman is already a shell
having drained the scientist it leaps blindingly fast onto the ceiling
it has no eyes but she can feel them on her anyway
she rips at her bonds with a terrible effort the newborn leaps at her and she pulls free with a scream plunging the thirty feet to the pool as the
alien flies over her missing landing on the far wall instead
ripley disappears beneath the surface of the water
the newborn turns its head trying to locate its lost prey
other aliens scutter closer to the pool
ripley stands up out of the pool covered in blood hoisting the killshriek rising from her throat as she fires taking out a host of aliens in a single sweep
just tagging the newborn as it leaps out of the way
aliens jump at her trying to kill and trying to protect the newborns but she blows them out of the air
it feels pretty good
a few shots go wild and punch big holes in the side of the tank
light streams in through them
ripley sees and continues firing in that direction
she makes a big enough hole that she can run and smash through to rolling and coming up in an instant
she looks around her
exit this way but there is a vent above her
the newborns head lunges at her the small hole making it impossible for the creature to get all the way through
but it wriggles pushing
ripley jumps up grabbing a pipe and kicks open the vent grate throwing herself up the vertical shaft with astonishing ease
vriess is scrambling away knocking over things to avoid the baby alien
johner shoots at the creature as it speeds towards vriess
dont shoot it
bettys hull is too thin
it knocks over cannisters as it speeds across the table and behind some instruments
vriess whered it go
dont shoot it
it leaps out of the darkness and heads straight for call she stumbles back trips it comes at her leaps right at her face she pulls her hand back and
flicks her wrist the stilletto pops out as the creatu flies at it the blade slides right into its mouth ramming eight inches through its innards before it pokes out the other end
blood spurts on call on the floor
the creature wriggles and finally falls free as the stilletto melts inside it
get behind the fucking wheel
ripley is climbing up the cramped vent with the speed and agility of an alien
unfortunately so are the aliens twenty feet below her
two drones in front with the newborn sqeezing close behind
ripley grabs a pole and her hand begins to steam its so hot
she cries out lets go
then looks down
grabs the pole again and ignoring the searing agony pulls pulls
rips out of the wall burning steam gushing out below her slowing down the aliens
she continues climbing then kicks through a grate
the auriga races toward earth
but not as weve seen it
the planet is still blue but almost two thirds of it is obscured by a giant orbitting latticework of metal a part shell that rotates sligtly faster than the planet
the auriga heads for a section of exposed earth
not long now
ripley drops to the ground and heads for the dock
airlock doors closing
she doesnt bother to try the door she hurls herself through the window landing in a hail of glass
she is on the platform that
runs the length of the dock
is barely visible past the far end sinking into the airlock as the massive airlock doors
slide slowly shut
a slam against the metal door behind her tells her the aliens are here
she picks herself up and runs and she can run fast
speeds across the platform faster faster the betty sinks of sight as the airlock doors move closer together fifteen feet apart ten
ripley reaches the edge of the platform and leaps just hurls herself off of the platform sails through the air thirty forty feet and down the airlock doors thirty feet
below almost closed she drops right through just before they close falls another fifteen feet and lands wham
on top of the auriga hard rolls lies there in extremes of pain
the crew look up at the sound
somethings on us
well shake it off on descent
outer doors opening
cut to ripley tries to pick herself up is momentarily too wiped
breathes heavily gets to her knees
we see ripley crawling toward the hatch and the huge outer airlock door opening beneath the ship
blue sky and wind the screen below
struggling to get to the hatch
and above her through a window into the docking bay we see the newborn appear
we got about forty seconds till we kiss the ground
go full thrust on the downdraft
its gonna be fucking close
ship not leveling for vertical drop
braking system nonfunctional
the airlock doors are almost
ripley has reached the hatch but cannot get it open
she pounds on it frustration and the newborn smashes through the window jumps down onto the ship
vriess punches it and the betty shoots down out of the airlock ripley and the newborn just barely hold on ripleys body thrown straight up as she grips the hatch
door for dear life
the newborn has a better grip it has more things to grip with but it too struggles with the sudden drop
speeding toward the earth
the betty shoots out the airlock and nearly smashes into the bottom of the ship as it passes like trash thrown out of a speeding car
the akiriga passes huge above them look out
the ship swerves as call expertly avoids the auriga and see ripley and the newborn on top still fighting for purchase the betty gets clear leveling out the auriga still
heads straight for earth as the terrain below becomes clear deserted snow covered mountains hanging on fighting to control the betty deserted halls passageways bodies and aliens milling here and there collision in six seconds
softly here we go
smashes into the ground a deafening exposion eating the massive ship in seconds utter cacophony
flying away the thundering firestorm behind it
an instrument panel suddenly sparks beside her warning lights flash the ship shaking as if under massive turbulence johner
vector controls fucked
we gotta put down
find me a path
johner sprays foam on the fire
there is a loud banging heard far overhead
what the fuck is that
is slamming her fist on the hatch doors hanging on with her other arm
the ship continues to tremble and buck shes nearly thrown off
she looks around at the alien
its almost on her
working its way painfully toward her gripping with its legs and tendrils
it slams a tentacle down at ripley but she rolls just holding on above the cockpit looking at a fuzzy external monitor
ripleys on the fucking hatch
in the cockpit call nearly goes white
let her in
theres something else out there with her
one of them
johner looks at the image realizes how masive the newborn is
awed fear creeps into his voice no
its something else
frustrated call jumps out of her seat
vriess fights to control the ship as she climbs up toward the hatch
johner grabs her practically throws her at the monitor
look at that fucking thing
we cant open up
they both tumble as the ship jerks is bucked off the ship before she grabs the newborns tentacle holds on to it the newborn smashes it against he ship trying
to shake her again she grabs an external grate and starts climbing painfully away
pushes johner aside as she makes for the hatch release sequence
desperately pulling up as wooded snowy mountains zoom dangerously close below
turns as the hatch opens nearby the door sliding slowly beast is torn between ripley and this new distraction ripley sees it too starts climbing for it frantically one on
the beast makes for the doorway and call pops halfway out pointing a grenade launcher at the thing
she blasts it once the beast roaring and starting back hurt but not nearly enough
call fires again but the ships rocking sends the shot wild
she flies back for all of a second the beast rears to attack but ripley is at the hatch call drags her in and closes the hatch the beast just
slamming in it as it closes
ripley is hanging on call exhausted
another bang on the hatch and they can see the door starting to give
call and ripley head into the cockpit
johner continues looking at the vidscreen at the beast
we cant to do a vertical setdown
braking systems are shot
find me a patch of land
ill put her down
call jumps back into the pilots seat by vriess
he pulls up hard on the wheel but the ship is still dangerously close to the ground
that thing isnt going anywhere
johner strap in
were coming down hard
angle betty approaches the rough wooded terrain just above the trees
hits a relatively clear patch touches down bounces back up and then down again fighting the wheel she cant pull it up hard enough
the ship blasts through trees
the newborn moves to the back of the ship to avoid debris
that things gone back behind the thrusters
call and ripley look at each other
call throws on the thrusters the ship rockets forward angle the engulfed in flame losing its grip going too fast call cant control it kill thrust
skids skids throwing up enormous debris
it hits another wooded area is thrown bodily into the windshield mows down a half acre of trees before finally grinding to a halt
as soon as theyve recovered call throws off her seatbelt
call is everbody all right
wherere you going
call opens the hatch
to make sure that thing is really dead its giant face lunges down at her piston tongue shooting out
it has charred black skin in some places that skin has fallen off and wet pink flesh shows through
call drops to the floor the tongue just missing her
johner scrambles for his gun as ripley drags her out of the way
as quickly as it came the head lurches back out
i think its gone
no its waiting for us to come out
can we fly
we cant fucking crawl
call looks at her
are you sure
call grabs a grenade launcher
ive got to stop it
call that thing is thirty minutes old
in a few hours itll grow up
if it reaches a place with people
she heads for the door but ripley is on her way
they exchange a look
youll never catch it
call tosses her the grenade launcher
the ship sits silent in the woods the trees around heavy with snow
ripley comes out the top
she looks around her sees the tracks in the snow
down off the ship
through the blur of trees she moves with the grace and speed of an animal leaping from boulders racing through the powdered brush this is ripley at peak speed and
it is something to see
she starts going up the way getting steeper and rockier til she reaches a cliff face and looks out on sprawling huge a million tiny lights cutting through the darknes
its just before the horizon
the newborn rises in front of ripley strikes her before she has a chance to aim her weapon
its tentacle cuts deeply into her sends her flying
the beast is on her in a second its enormous jaws missing her head by an inch as she rolls grabs the grenade launcher fire the beast is thrown but
just grazed back on her as she tries to get off another shot it slams a foot down right on her she screams the launcher rolls free the beast coming in for the kill and over the ridge flies the harvester call at the controls
aiming right for the newborn
it rears up to see it just as the girl rams it into the creatures head it knocks it on its ass the harvester shaking but not quite spinning out
as call comes around for another shot
ripley scrambles to safety as the newborn prepares for the oncoming harvester it whips its tentacles at it but call swerves at the last second the monster spins with it
screaming sees ripley and slashes at her
knocks her off the cliff she falls grabs brush it snaps she starts slinding down rockface and she takes her hand slams her fingers into the smooth rock face like
a pick axe it rips her nails bloody but she digs out purchase
slams into the newborn from behind the girl nearly thrown out of the harvester the newborn spins and grabs it call throws it into reverse but the newborn is too
strong holds on bringing its head up to face call herself
bloody and torn it smashes into the rockface as she climbs back to the top swings the harvester into a tree call nearly knocked loose again
the monster is jolted as well lets go call pilots the machine back through the trees the alien watching it growling call flies deftly through the trees away away then
spins out heads back for the beast at top speed the wind roars as she closes the newborn spins and she slams into it it goes flying screaming in pain the harvester bouncing off it flipping over crashing against the trees and landing tilted upside down call unconscious between it and the ground
the newborn shudders rises makes for the harvester it clearly pissed
ripley pulls herself over the ridge sees the situation rushes toward them
call awakens to see the monster approaching the machine
terrified but determined she reaches for a lever no
calling out to distract it she runs waving her arms
let it come
let it come
tears run through her voice as she strains for the lever
the beast is torn and for a moment doesnt move
ripley looks over to where call is and understanding blooms on her face
she looks around and spots halfway between her and the newborn
for a moment neither of them moves
then ripley runs the newborn comes at her with equal speed like theyre playing chicken ripley dives at the ground rolls comes up holdin the grenade launcher and she fipes
the newborn is hit up close and dead center this time and it rears back screaming ripley fires and fires driving it back toward the upended harvester
the alien rears up to its full height and ripley pulls
there is a hollow click
furious ripley stares a moment at the beast
a sscream wells up in her throat and she throws herself at it leaping impossibly high smashing into it and sending both of them tumbling onto the harvester
call pulls the lever
in an instant the machine roars to life a thousand blades grinding to top speed pulverizing the beast consuming it sucking it down as layer upon layer of alien flesh
is chopped into messes
and it shrieks a noise unheard before as it thrashes frantically
ripley tries to pull herself off it before the blades get too close but the beast grabs her holds her
the blades ever closer as she struggles with it
still trapped below she sees the aliens blood seeping through the machine all around her
she squirms trying to get away but shes stuck
a stream of blood lands on her shoulder eating it away
another on her leg and panic blooms bright in her
galvanized by the cry ripley tears herself out of the beasts dying grasp flips backwards off the harvester as it begins to smoke and spark blood eating through the controls
call writhes blood everywhere now
she is lost in primal terror
ripley wriggles her way under and regardless of the streams of blood splattering her wrenchs call free
she drags her out
a section of the harvester explodes raining fire and debris or the dying alien
call lies on the ground ripley behind her arms wrapped tight around her
covered in blood and grime the two watch the alien go up in flames breathing hard holding each other as if their lives depended on it still
burning hollowed out by the licks of flame that caress it
collapsing gently on itself
the four of them sit by the huge camp fire watching the flames
vriess tosses christie a bottle of whiskey
the bitch takes her time in burning
well it looks like shes finally giving it up
troopers should be finding our ship any time now
dont much love the idea of being around when they do
ripley gets up looks out over the cliffs edge at the lights the city
christie offers the bottle to call
she takes it and drinks
vriess to call i guess you wont want to be answering any official questions either
i guess not
she is grateful for the suggestion that they are in it together
well were on earth for chrissake
plenty of places to get lost here
so ive heard
after a moment she gets up as well goes over to ripley
she hands her the bottle
ripley looks at it
its a drink
you drink it
ripley smiling i remember
so what do you think
what should we do now
i dont know
she looks out in the distance
ripley im a stranger here myself the two of them stand side by side staring out at the unfamiliar horizon as the newborn dwindles in the dancing flame
