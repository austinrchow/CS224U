screenplay by jonathan lemkin and tony gilroy based on the novel by andrew neiderman january devils advocate rev
northern florida in the midst of a heat wave
air conditioners fighting a losing battle
the gallery is full
the judge a stern old hand
the prosecutor an efficient man with a good case
the witness is barbara
she is maybe
she is a witness in a criminal trial
her testimony has been carefully rehearsed
we go back to our homeroom for dismissal unless you have a pass for sports or something
and is that what you did on the day in question
gettys asked me to stay after class
what happened next barbara
gettys closed the door
everyone else had gone
he told me to sit in the chair beside his desk
gettys the defendant is
the very picture of respectability
his perfect wife and son staunchly enduring this testimony
in your own words barbara can you tell us exactly what happened during the next few minutes
taking it all in
i told him i was afraid i would miss my bus
he promised i would get to the bus on time if i would help him to do something
kevin his eyes drifting around the courtroom taking inventory assessing damage then he put before i could say anything he placed his hand inside my blouse
kevin checking the jury and i was so frightened i didnt move
i thought if i was just quiet it would be okay
kevin checking gettys seeing something that stops him cold then his other hand went up under inside my skirt
gettys hand down below the table down where no one but kevin could possibly see it gettys fingers subtly feeling their way along the leg of his chair his hand
then it started he started moving back and forth farther and farther inside my skirt
kevin glancing around nobody else can see it he said he was testing to see if i had any special feelings that he wanted to find out what kind of
feelings i had
gettys hand excited now stroking the chair leg absently involuntarily unmistakably sexual i didnt know what to say i was trying to think of something to say but i was
confused and he just kept on with his hand moving it under my dress higher and higher
kevin is rocked
trying not to show it
then i i was asking him to stop but it was like he couldnt hear me he just kept on suddenly gettys hand stops moving and then i screamed
kevin looks up to find gettys eyes waiting for him
gettys quickly returns his hand into his lap
hes been caught watching as kevin turns away and then he he got mad and said we would have to try again sometime
and did he try again
not with me
with friends of yours
and when you told them what he had done to you they told you what he had done to them isnt that true
i have nothing further
finding kevin your witness mr
any chance your honor for a short recess
kevin heading quickly away from the courtroom
gettys right on his heels
lloyd as your attorney im advising you to get the fuck away from me
what are you talking about
you definitely had me fooled
youre my lawyer
youre here to defend me
you know what im thinking
why dont we put you on the stand and you can jerk off for the judge
you know shes lying
get the hell out of my way
gettys standing aside as we an ancient upstairs facility
kevin standing at the mirror
he takes off his wedding ring
letting cold water run in the sink
his eyes never leaving the mirror
behind him the door opens
a local reporter enters moves to the urinal
well hell there you are
rumor was you were out wandering in traffic
not now larry
whats the game plan kevin
i got a four thirty deadline
i need a quote
gimme a quote
lomax had no comment on todays events
speculation however was widespread that the young lawyers unblemished string of victories would come to an end in this courtroom
kevin pulls some cold water to his face
startled as thunder explodes overhead then just as suddenly becomes nothing more than the urinal flushing
it was a nice run kev
had to close out someday
nobody wins em all
the reporter exits
kevin alone with the mirror
and then its over
hes made his decision
replacing his wedding ring
reaching for his jacket as we kevin walking through
his game face
a court officer opening the doors and devils advocate rev
barbara on the stand
everyone in place
math hasnt exactly been your subject this year has it
any theories on why youve done so poorly in math this year
its not my fault
would you say mr
gettys is the problem
as she shrugs youre not sure
have you had any discipline problems in math class this year
isnt it true mr
gettys has had to talk to you repeatedly about your behavior
isnt that why he asked you to stay after class
have other teachers ever asked you to stay after class
once or twice
did they want to talk about your behavior
goes to motive
devils advocate rev
you may answer the question
i dont know what the other teachers wanted
youd have to talk to them
you ever pass notes in class barbara
maybe a note that made fun of mr
never called him a disgusting pig monster
kevin handing out paperwork
your honor ive pre marked this defense exhibit a
objection your honor weve had plenty of time for discovery here
the judge quickly studying his copy of the note
im gonna let this in mr
lomax im also gonna suggest that if you have any other exhibits you present in a timely fashion or not at all
right to the note im sorry barbara i was wrong its huge hog beast
this is your handwriting isnt it
yes but devils advocate rev
you wrote this in his class
its a joke
hes a huge hog beast
he probably eats a thousand pancakes for breakfast
youre writing here about mr
gettys arent you
it was meant to be a joke
have you ever had a party at your house when your parents were away
waiting yes or no
this is way out of
credibility and bias
answer the question
the word special came up in your testimony earlier
you claimed that mr
gettys asked you whether you had special feelings if you felt special
beat have you ever heard of a game called special places
waiting youre under oath barbara
a mans career his reputation his life is on the line
this is not a joke
have you ever played the game special places
devils advocate rev
is this game sexual in nature
waiting is this game sexual in nature
we only played it once
this special party barbara this was the first time you told the story about mr
ive spoken to the other children who were there that day
can you think of anything else barbara they might have told me about that party
your honor if he has other witnesses let him call them
right at barbara if i need to call those other children i will
im gonna sustain that mr
rephrase your question
you threatened those children didnt you
thats not the way it happened you told them to falsely claim that mr
gettys had hurt them didnt you
these things did happen
devils advocate rev
because if they didnt go along you were going to tell everyone about this special party
they happened to me
so you made up a story
a special story about a math teacher a disgusting pig monster you didnt like
thats what really happened isnt it
i didnt want to be the only one
barbaras father can take it no longer suddenly on his feet charging you son of a bitch
the bailiff making a diving grab i have no further questions your honor
chaos court officers struggling with barbaras father and people yelling and gettys hugging his wife and son and the gavel banging like mad and kevin just sitting there staring at
the floor completely drained emotionally morally physically and in the back of the room a man
amused by the scene
his name is leamon heath
mary ann lomax leans in behind her husband
she is a doll
we love her
pack it up baby
you need a drink
its a rock and roll joint
but its early and empty
kevin at the bar with mary ann two lawyer friends the reporter and someones girl friend
shot glasses two rows of six
a perfect tequila pour and in the event we all get drunk and forget i suggest we frontload the ceremonial bullshit
a toast to the best damn trial lawyer in alachua county
kevin subdued watches the rest of them drink
so kev off the record hows it feel to squeeze a man like gettys through the door of reasonable doubt
waving him off i told you already were not gonna discuss that damn case anymore
to kevin am i right
ill drink to that
as he does no shop talk
as the night goes on
drunk frat boys laughing as they exit
a bar band in the distance
kevin done pissing
moving for the sink when he suddenly stops
a mirror above the sink
there he is
the guy that set gettys free
kevin turns leamon heath standing beside him
helluva job today
quickly presenting his card i didnt want to disturb your party
milton chadwick waters
never heard of it
looking up whatre you gonna do
actually we were hoping to retain your services
weve been following your progress
from new york
youve never lost a case
ive had some sympathetic juries
thats exactly what were looking for
we want you to come to new york
help us pick a jury
amused now ill tell you man
youre pretty damn good
and the card is great
and the black thing you being black whose idea was that
cause thats just brilliant
as hes walking im just not drunk enough yet to fall for it
youd have to start next week
waiting as kevin stops there all expenses
first class travel and lodging
you and your wife
a lump sum payment regardless of verdict in the amount of well
in his hand here
take a look
kevin takes the check
still looking at it as we two dozen cars parked
music and singing from inside
a sign reads inside the church
plain and functional
poor but faithful
a trio electric guitar accordion tambourine playing a hymn
forty five voices raised in song
the tempo is ragged and the pitch shaky but the feeling is strong
they mean it
the camera finds mrs
singing her heart out
a woman with faith in the presence of her lord
the camera finds kevin
in the very back
standing in the doorway
lomax and kevin walking to her car
its two weeks at most
youve never been to new york
every dog gets a day
pick a jury
ridiculous i feel the hand of mary ann on this adventure
new york is not a good idea
look how you fixed for cash
i have my bad feeling
an envelope i put a couple hundred in here
sounds like more than two weeks
mary ann typed out the numbers for you phone the flights its all in there
let me tell you about new york
with a smile babylon
forewarned is forearmed
half serious fallen fallen is babylon the great
it has become a dwelling place of demons
wouldnt hurt you to look it over
rolls with it couldnt forget it if i tried
and what happened to babylon
thou mighty city
in one hour hast thou mighty judgement come
and the light of a single lamp shall shine in thee no more
kevin gathers her in
kissing her good bye as we darkness
where are we
a door opens in another room voices kevin and mary ann
coming in from a big night out
for an instant light we glimpse a great hotel suite and then wait leave em off what are you
i cant close your eyes do it more laughter
stumbling shadows moving past us and okay
kevin behind mary ann with his hands over her eyes
he takes his hands away but her eyes stay closed
open your eyes
as she does wow
the definitive new york skyline
in her ear
bite the big apple
rats on the west side bed bugs uptown i cant give it away on seventh avenue
this town dont look good in tatters
i dont know
looks to me like that dress is in your way
shocked stops why counselor
her best drawl surely you dont think a small town girl changes overnight just because a man buys her dinner in the big city
in fact i hardly ever think at all
well thats different then
youre my kind of guy
shes taking off the dress
six huge courthouses
all those courtrooms
potential jurors fill the benches
a bored judge
meisel defense counsel is a sour new york veteran
the juror being questioned a pie faced man with bad vision
devils advocate rev
do you think as a juror youd be able to set aside any prior opinions you might hold about the savings and loan industry
long pause that was a question sir
do i like bankers
heath catches meisels eye
waves him over
your honor may i have a minute to speak with my colleagues
kevin and heath
and the defendant a well tailored reptilian banker
meisel joins them
while youre at it lets get rid of number six eight and id say lose number twelve except the prosecutors gonna fuck up and do it for us
youre kidding right
shes my first choice
shes my first pass
with the dreadlocks
hes a defendant juror if i ever saw one
you see his shoes
look kid maybe down in florida youre the next big thing but this is new york
were not squeezing oranges here
he polishes those shoes every night
he makes his own clothes
he may look like a brother with an attitude to you but i see a man whos got a shotgun under his bed and woe betide the creature who steps
into his garden
beat and number six
shes damaged goods
shes a catholic schoolteacher
to heath she believes in human frailty
theres something missing from her
eyes to the pool she wants on this jury
somebody hurt her and she wants revenge
how the hell do you know that
honestly i dont know
to heath look either you put a stop to this happy horseshit or i walk
a pause all right
heres the deal
to kevin i lose with your jury
you do the explaining
the defendant staring a hole into kevin as we kevin leaving court
in no hurry to get home
he likes it here
across the street a man one of many passing on the sidewalk
except this man turns as kevin passes
seeing something that pleases him
this is john milton
and now as kevin disappears milton joins the flow of people heading down into a subway station down and gone as we pull back to as day becomes night
mary ann watching tv alone
remnants of a room service dinner
theyve been living here for weeks now
the maids have started to give up
kevin enters looking beat
grabs a cold french fry
into her show your mother called
she has her bad feeling
every now and then she gets one right
looks over you okay
they deliberated for thirty eight minutes
devils advocate rev
turns off the tv comforting him oh kevin
im sorry honey
what the hell did they expect
the man is guilty as can be
wasnt a jury anywhere gonna let him off
a big ole smile not fucking guilty
thirty eight minutes
you did it
put on something thats gonna be easy to take off later
we are going out girl
milton chadwick waters
those words written in stone on the wall
the decor is stark dramatic awesome
the receptionist is simply stunning
kevin wearing his best suit walking with heath
sorry to keep you waiting but mr
milton got pinned down in indonesia a little longer than expected
quietly as they hit the view not bad huh
you can play it cool if you want but the first time i walked in here my jaw was on the floor
the firm offices
a large central atrium
offices rim this space
lawyers come in all shapes and sizes
assistants male and female are uniformly attractive
the hum of serious business in the background
as they walk weve got forty partners vested at the moment
close to six hundred associates
this is the home office but weve got quite a few international arrangements so mr
milton spends a good deal of his time in the air
in addition to our corporate clients were currently representing about twenty five foreign countries
mid east balkans central america west africa
interesting work but travel intensive
kevin slowing as they pass an open doorway hes got you scheduled for fifteen minutes which is a good sign so make the most of it
through a large window we see a woman pacing her office
shes wearing a headset and arguing in machine gun italian
she is a goddess
her name is christabella
she is beautiful beyond propriety
she will also turn out to be a brilliant euc lawyer
sees us staring like that venetian blinds close tightly
heath is now far ahead
kevin rushing to catch up kevin about six steps into it when suddenly he looks down
smiles man i just love that
the floor is nothing but glass
sixty stories above the world
a bridge between two skyscrapers
i watched a senator piss his pants right where youre standing
hes waiting for you
kevin sucks it up
up ahead nothing but an open door
first of all its round
the walls are made of stone
there are dramatic shafts of natural light from above
stark and clean to the extreme
no paper anywhere
kevin standing there
taking in the space
there he is
didnt mean to
his hand kevin lomax
they shake john milton
nice to meet you
have we been treating you well
your wife shes had a good time
she sure has
its been great
the whole things been great
thats our secret
we kill you with kindness
walking the room circling whats your secret
i couldnt say
you were a prosecutor
out of law school
five years in the jacksonville d
sixty four straight convictions
what a number
i like to be in court
i didnt plea out a lot
whats that like
one day youre putting them away and the next youre setting them free
takes a little getting used to
pays better though doesnt it
yes it does
the math teacher
the gettys case
i hear you were brilliant
prosecutor dropped the ball
devils advocate rev
so you think your guy was guilty
i didnt say that
what did you say
i began the case with a clear conscience
quiet a moment i was sure you had a secret
the mens room
beat upstairs mens room in the duval county courthouse
theres a hole in the wall
straight through to the next room
smiles i spent five years listening to juries deliberate
i love it
love it all you want just dont repeat it
im not sure the florida bar association would appreciate it
you dont really want to go back to florida do you
walk with me
with that milton pushes a button
huge panel screens open out to a reflecting pool
water right to the edge
a narrow walkway straight through the middle
and were fifty stories above the city
the effect is staggering
devils advocate rev
what do you think
some people cant handle it
pleased fill in the resume
tell me about your family
what does your father do
i never got to know my father
he passed away before i was born
my mom raised me
just the two of us
she never remarried
she wasnt married the first time
that cant be easy in gainesville
i dont think its easy anywhere
re the view holy shit
little different when youre looking down isnt it
beat tell me about her
whats she like
shes a preachers daughter
shes worked in the same poultry plant for as long as i can remember
i think shes up to eight fifty an hour
shes got a church she really likes so shes usually either there or they go out they do a lot of volunteer work
devils advocate rev
many are in high places and of great renown but mysteries are revealed unto the meek
so they say
didnt rub off on you
im on parole
early release for time served
suddenly theyre quiet
silenced by the view
lotta potential clients down there
sooner or later it all flows through the streets
you dont have to sell me on new york
you like it here dont you
are we negotiating
why do you need a criminal department
because our clients break the law just like everyone else and im tired of sending their business across the street
are you offering me a job
im thinking about it
you have the talent
i knew that before you got here
its the other thing i wonder about
devils advocate rev
what thing is that
some people you squeeze them they focus
some people fold
can you summon your talent at will
can you deliver on deadline
can you sleep at night
when do we talk about money
moneys the easy part
high off central park
a mercedes stretch pulls to the curb
sinai hospital right up the street
some excellent schools
the driver rushing to open the door
heath kevin and mary ann getting out of the car just as a group of uniformed school children come charging out of the building to meet their bus
i doubt it was at the top of his list when mr
milton bought the building but its a great neighborhood for children
a stately pre war apartment house
one unique touch the penthouse rises in a sort of wedding cake design
turn of the century
two apartments per floor
jackie heath waiting here
she is black early thirties and very very attractive
the elevator doors open
mary ann steps out followed by kevin and heath
you must be mary ann welcome
im jackie heath
its so sweet of you to come by
we live across the hall
so its just two apartments per floor
to her husband you didnt tell them about the apartment
i thought id let it speak for itself
opening the door and we enter a dream
twelve foot ceilings
huge oversized rooms
a huge central hallway
kevin and mary ann walking through
its what they call a classic eight
we had them paint everything white
let you see it naked before you pick your palette
what am i picking
i need to warn you about one thing
as they turn back there are going to be some very envious people at the firm
these apartments there arent many of them its really a partners perk
you mustve made quite an impression
took us six years to get in here
french doors opening
kevin walks out
mary ann just behind him
they stand there staring at the park
are you really this good
devils advocate rev
i sure as hell hope so
they must want you pretty bad
look mare im only getting behind this if youre on board
you want to go home im with you
lets go back to gainesville
you can keep scrounging for clients and pumping out the basement and ill keep repossessing cars for akamian
maybe if we kill ourselves in about five years we can afford a baby and a weekend shack at gulf shores
beat are you shitting me
she smiles first
kevin pulling her toward him as we incredible and extreme
forty people senior partners and department heads seated at the table
theyve been going around the table introducing themselves to kevin
nearing the end now krasna
i run the islamic sub group
mergers and acquisitions
christabella and another woman running in
taking seats quickly
christabella beside kevin
devils advocate rev
primarily g and e
there you go kevin
the whole team
im trying to think how long its been since we were all together
all of us
im looking around i know some of you came from very far away to be with us here today
pacing the window this room were in was built architecturally designed to promote healthy group dynamics
a psychic centrifuge
makes you want to reach out doesnt it
all that good shit
thats what im looking for today
because when i hear stories the kind of stories ive been hearing about backbiting about partners not working together departments cutting each others throats over clients or worse
i feel drained
it drains me
i feel empty
i feel as though ive let you all down
off dead silence we need something
across the table what do i need eddie
how about a public flogging
wait a minute
i got it
doesnt cost a thing
theres a power to it
what is it
beat lets hold hands
all of us
milton is first
reluctance begins to fold
devils advocate rev
every person at this table take the hand of the person on either side
kevin finds christabellas hand at his side
you want out of this eddie
youve made your point john
you wont hold hands
stare down its important to me eddie
kevin watching barzoon fold
watching the circle form
see i feel better already
stripped down at the moment but theres a desk and phone
what do you think
kidding i guess itll do
until something better comes along
in the doorway pam garrety
two pack a day habit
tough as dirt
as they shake pam was with the brooklyn d
s office for fourteen years so she knows her way around the local scene
shell be your guide
to pam youre gonna be expediting his new york bar application right
in the pipeline
for now well just have you work pro hac vice
weve petitioned florida for a letter of good conduct
a folder i prepared at mr
miltons request an overview of the moyez case
the moyez case
deep ghetto side street
one of those blocks that have been completely lost
one whole side of the street has nothing but boarded up row houses
a black town car pulling through
slowing now kevin and his driver peering across the street
i gotta stick with the vehicle
a storefront botanica
rusted iron grates covering two tiny cataract windows
a steel door is open
theres a sick looking dog tied to the doorknob he begins barking wildly as he sees kevin walking from the car
suit and tie
turning as he hears devils advocate rev
you get em
go get em man
three junkies camped on the stoop of a burned out brownstone across the street
dull wasted faces aroused by the dogs barking tell her turn that shit down
i know what shes doin
tell em take that noise back tafrica fore i stopping instantly because a woman is standing in the botanica doorway
her skin is jet black
her eyes are pale blue
her hair is white
she holds a live chicken by its feet
the dog is still barking so she slaps it
now there is silence
im looking for phillipe moyez
she moves aside
kevin enters its dark
oil lamps and candles for light
the air thick with incense
jars and bags and boxes are stacked on shelves everywhere
i called this morning im not sure who i spoke with
awkward silence im his lawyer
i have a card
finding it they said he would meet me here
into the back bhalla
kevin taking a very deep breath as we darkness
a door opening above us
a boy maybe ten standing there
kevin behind him
look im not sure im making myself clear here
a french accent you need him
speak wid him
the boy hits the lights
a naked bulb on the landing below
beyond that darkness
youre saying hes down here
incredulous in the basement
in the dark
where you think
where you think me taking you
the boy still laughing starts down the stairs into the darkness
sucks it up
crouching not to hit his head as he goes down into around the landing the boy still in front of him and down as another light comes up and the
boy moves quickly through the space turning on lamps here and there
mounds of bones
the walls painted a deep black red
kevin waiting as the last light goes on i thought i would recognize you but i do not
kevin spooked wheels around
phillipe moyez squatting in the corner
skinny and intense
his eyes opaque and piercing at the same time
at once unassuming and terrifying
a plastic bag of fresh green roots in his lap
his teeth black from chewing it
as he nods weve never met
im a lawyer
im here about the animals
as you wish
ill be arguing your case with the city
i need to ask you some questions
gets folder ive done a little preliminary research precedent cases in the past that dealt with santeria and vou no
this is not santeria
we are not voodoo
none of that
we are much older
before all of it
is there a name
we have papers
at your firm
we have the tax exemption
ill get right into that
scribbling away the animals
lets start with that then
we have an investment in blood
think of it as spiritual currency
starts slowly across the room
moyez im going to need your help with this
thats very clear
perhaps we could start at the beginning
moyez ignoring him moves to an old refrigerator beside the stairs
for an instant the door is open just a glimpse
bags of entrails
jars of blood
moyez goes to a workbench near the wall mr
what is the name of the man who will prosecute us
scanning file merto
assistant district attorney arnold merto
la chemise noire
the boy already running up the stairs
the sound of nails falling onto the workbench what are you doing mr
moyez stands aside wiping his hands on his trousers
a huge beef tongue sits on the bench
the nails are scattered around it
you can go now
you will have all the help i can give you
moyez now with a hammer
and the nail
driving it into the tongue
kevin backing away as we video monitor full frame
devils advocate rev
hand held footage of a police raid
were running through a building new york cops an animal control officer through a door voices yelling down some steps into a back yard people standing here a scuffle starting
voices rising the camera shaking we see bhalla and the woman and there in the middle is a goat on its knees its throat has just been cut blood pouring into a pan and moyez holding its head with one hand a knife in the other and this positively orgiastic expression on his face and on that image we freeze frame
with the remote control
pam there with him
a long sour silence
what do you think
its a health code case
and its a loser
so whats the point
watching her its a test right
the smart thing to do is make a deal
plea him out and suppress the tape
im sure the d
s waiting for your call
yeah well let him wait
beat and you can tell milton too
beat i didnt come to new york to plea bargain
devils advocate rev
jackie rejecting mary anns color choices
law books stacked around
an associate wheels in a trolley with more books
mary ann eating fried chicken
she doesnt like the wallpaper
shes tearing it off as we kevin working late
across the hall pam is going home
its only a health code case
judge theo sklar and staff
merto at his seat
pam sits with moyez
other than that its empty
a rump roast slaps down onto a table
thats a veal roast your honor
approved and stamped
eight days ago in kansas city two men pushed a calf into a steel frame as a third man fired a high voltage staple gun into the animals skull
men kill animals and eat their flesh
phillipe moyez killed a goat
he killed a goat
and he did it at home in a manner consistent with his religious beliefs
now some people may find it bizarre
devils advocate rev
its certainly not a religious practice performed by everyone
its not as common as say circumcision
its certainly not as common as the belief that wine is transformed into blood
its not even as common as the handling of poisonous snakes to prove ones faith
but phillipe moyez isnt two thousand miles away in a stockyard
he doesnt use electricity to kill
and worst of all
holding up the roast phillipe moyez is not shrink wrapped
merto begins to cough
quietly at first but
your honor the city timed this police action to catch my client exercising his constitutionally protected right to religious freedom
mertos coughing getting worse as he tries to stop
this is a law protecting kosher butchering
exactly your honor
and id like to move at this time for an immediate directed verdict for dismissal
moyez staring a hole in merto and the man cannot stop coughing
i happen to know a little bit about kashrut law mr
devils advocate rev
im aware of that your honor which is why i feel confident in requesting a dismissal
merto cant speak wheezing and coughing as we empty and dark
kevin moyez and pam leaving the courtroom
moyez shaking his hand and thanking him and then from behind them the sound of one person clapping coming toward them bravo kevin
as he arrives pamela youre looking lovely
to moyez satisfied phillipe
kevin what can i say
kevin trying to look modest and failing as we a street food stall
milton paying for kevins eggroll
and theyre walking
best street food in the world
tell me it isnt great
as kevin eats new york
what a scene right
devils advocate rev
guy like moyez living in that subterranean shithole all the time hes running around with fifteen million dollars in the bank
you gotta be kidding
what do you think
were giving you away
hes paying us in goats blood
im billing you out at four hundred an hour my friend
i dont see a whole lot of pro bono work in your immediate future
buzzing here seriously what i like you got in there with him
inside the cage
cant be taught
you gotta hear that on your own
its gotta be in your blood
i bet ive got five thousand lawyers working around the planet
i couldnt name ten couldnt name three id trust with moyez
so what the hell are they doing
what are they doing
theyre corporate lawyers what do you think theyre doing
theyre busy reducing life and death to the proper position of a semi colon
theyre doing needlepoint
push button battles
push button wars
armies that get so fucking far away from each other they need satellites to tell them who won
one big multinational circle jerk
you on the other hand youre on the slaughterhouse floor
you cant help but smell your clients
i figure you came to court to make sure i didnt fuck this up
devils advocate rev
maybe i did
but dont get too cocky
no matter how good you are
dont let them see you coming
thats the gaff my friend make yourself small
be the hick
the shit kicking surfer
look at me ive been underestimated from day one
do i look like a master of the universe
thats your only weakness as far as i can tell
the florida stud thing
scuse me maam did i leave my boots under your bed
never worked a jury didnt have a woman
you know what youre missing
what i have
this beautiful girl shes just fucked me every way she knows how were done shes walking to the bathroom she turns back and there i am
and she smiles its like a veil coming down across her face and that smile thats a question mark because shes looking at me shes wondering how did that happen
and see right there from that moment on shes got a secret
im the hand up mona lisas skirt
im the whisper in nefertittis ear
im a surprise
they never see me coming
thats what youre missing
milton escaping across the street
so why did you come down today
devils advocate rev
because i knew it was gonna be good
because i knew i was gonna like it
that you would shine that we would take this walk that wed really talk
why i came down

he never loses
catching himself look im rambling because im excited
youre in the part of the game i like best
the realm of the true believers
you are a believer arent you
i believe in the presumption of innocence
better a hundred guilty men go free than a single innocent be executed
devils advocate rev
something like that
exactly like that
youre either in or out
you cant believe a little bit
i was kidding
youre not here to amuse me
see thats why people hate lawyers
so many of us have lost our faith
dont let that happen to you
milton offering a token
behind him the entrance to the canal street station learn the subways kevin
stay in the trenches
kevin taking the token as we kevin just coming in from work
the apartment is starting to come together
still not enough furniture but the sparseness reads as elegance
walking through mare
from the bedroom youre late
devils advocate rev
in the hallway a wall is missing sheetrock stacked on the floor tools piled around a renovation project halted for the night
whats all this
mary ann up the hall in the bedroom door
finishing her makeup for a night out
smiles it was gonna be a nursery but then i remembered youd have to be home long enough to knock me up so now im thinking of building a law
drops his briefcase
drops his pants
save the thought
we were due up there fifteen minutes ago
she blows him a kiss
ducking back into bedroom
kevin and mary ann in their go to meeting clothes
tell me i can handle this
you can handle this
say something nice
promise me you wont leave me alone in there
devils advocate rev
how the hell did we get here
the door opens
diana barzoon tonights hostess standing there
there you are
to kevin diana barzoon eddies wife
an air kiss for mary ann come on you two
everyone cant wait to meet you
twice the size of kevins place
decorated and furnished to the max
seventy five guests and ten in staff
the crowd is very smart sleek and experienced at these sort of things
mary anns hand squeezing kevins just a bit more tightly as diana leads them into the throng and we begin faces some of them strangers
some of them familiar from the conference room scene
huddled with jackie and mary ann as heath brings them drinks from the bar
and two lawyers near the terrace doors the smoking section talking with nicotine driven intensity
devils advocate rev
simply walking through the room
theyve found kevin and mary ann
i love the eights
the entire a line such a great shell
manic and perhaps a bit insane i do
i envy you
starting from scratch
do you have your fabrics yet
tell me you dont
i dont think so

to kevin im borrowing your wife
be gentle honey
these are normal people
mary ann giving kevin a help me look as shes dragged into the party your first

front door abuzz milton has just arrived
devils advocate rev
across the room mary ann with jackie and diana and another wife who is that
looking over my god girl

milton across the room looks over hes found them already coming toward them smiling i swear he can hear us
hell he can smell us
his hand and eyes i was hoping wed meet tonight
and here you are already swimming with the sharks
even as he says this hes kissing their smiling cheeks
mary ann looking a little lost as we kevin talking with another lawyer
looking over as christabella glides through the room
milton and mary ann sitting together
devils advocate rev
i mean thats what it comes down to
you can call yourself a finance trainee or a financial resources adviser or whatever youre still spending most of your day trying to hammer car payments out of deadbeats
looking around no deadbeats here tonight
youd be surprised
theres a lot more fear in this room than youd think
what do these people have to be afraid of
what scares you
not knowing who the deadbeats are
youll figure that out
theres only one thing worth being frightened of anyway and thats being alone
truly and finally alone
i think youre right
you know what terrifies me
lets be honest ive changed your life
changed it forever
theres been a seismic shift in your existence and im responsible
and youve never even met me
were talking for the very first time
how insane is that
devils advocate rev
its a wonderful opportunity for kevin
im not worried about kevin
he buys a few new suits
learns a few new tricks
i dont worry about kevin
what about you
im not leaving a lot behind
you must have family
i havent spoken to my folks in a long time
my sister ran all the way to germany
i gotta think about that
i had you down as daddys little girl you know
sugar plum snapshots

so youve got a lot at stake here
youve made a real commitment
i guess i have
its not gonna be like gainesville but then you know that already

devils advocate rev

you mean you want me to pull my hair back
if i do it everyone in this room thats pretending not to watch us will assume were fucking or something
pull back your hair
theres the mirror take a look
isnt that incredible
you need to cut your hair
a womans shoulders are the frontlines of her mystique
and her neck if shes alive has the very mystery of a border town
its the no mans land in the battle between mind and body
beat you know your natural color would really bring out your eyes
mary ann frozen there as we devils advocate rev
kevin standing at the rail
he looks over
christabella not ten feet away

devils advocate rev
laughing oh dear im going to scare you away

milton in the doorway

thru thru devils advocate rev
getting louder and wilder
mary ann looking lost
searching for kevin
hes not here
have you seen kevin
jackie heath shaking her head no as mary ann continues on through the party
kevin heath and barzoon
mary ann still looking for kevin
stopping as she reaches a door
opening it and just enough light to make out two men standing across the room
silhouettes against the window
in doorway im looking for my husband
the men two vaguely familiar faces from the firm
dont think hes here
suddenly a womans head rises into frame its just us
but feel free to join in
and suddenly its clear shes walked in on an impromptu menage a trois
the woman is kneeling on a table dress hiked up ass in the air
man fucking her from behind
man is getting blown and mary ann in shot as the woman begins to laugh and the door wipes the frame
devils advocate rev
one enormous room
grand scale everything
of special special interest a huge bas relief dominates an entire wall
carved into the marble are human forms young naked bodies swimming in a hypnotic chaos of clouds
milton is on the phone
two lines going
the dialogue is unimportant well not understand it anyway hes going back and forth between korean and russian brokering some emergency deal
heath is at the bar mixing drinks
barzoon has a cigar
kevin just standing there gaping at the space
is there more to it
just this room
and a bedroom
where does he sleep
who said he sleeps
where does he fuck
behind them everywhere
whats up john

devils advocate rev

with that the phone starts ringing thats pam calling
to kevin are we fighting for this or not
kevin tiptoeing through the apartment turning the corner and you left me there
i had a fucking panic attack until jackie told me where you were
raw three hours
you dont even call
im upstairs im with milton and barzoon and there is a very good possibility that im about to catch a triple homicide defendant who also happens to be the largest
real estate developer in the city
i had to bail on the party
you bailed on me
did you hear me
i was all by myself
for three whole hours
as shes walking you gotta be kidding right
no shes leaving
kevin left there alone devils advocate rev
a news van whipping up the block
tires screeching as it pulls up beside a construction site where two other news vans are already unloading
the smell of headlines and two photographers sprinting toward the shell of a high rise building
a sign blankets the scaffolding
huge ego size lettering reads
the next great address looking down from fifty stories high as the media vehicles converge like toys below
look at this im not out twenty minutes were running from the goddamn press
look at those insects down there
alexander cullen turns back from the edge
tan grief stricken and sleep deprived
the space is huge and bare
wide open views
kevin milton and barzoon standing there
you may be right but look at it from my point of view
im sure hes a whiz kid
i believe you
but this is my ass were talking
to barzoon jesus eddie
alex you know how this town works
youve got enemies you never heard of
now youre down
id prepare for a class a new york pig fuck
youre going to have to ask yourself who you really trust
who do you trust alex
devils advocate rev
i dont know
i gotta look around
you dont have time to shop mr
the newspaper jury selection started this morning at every breakfast table in the city
you lost round one
this is what people know
they know you and your wife were living separately
they see this maid elucinda a sixty eight year old grandmother supporting seven children
and then theres your stepson a ten year old with a bullet in his brain
those are already powerful images in the mind of the public
i didnt kill anybody
im telling you how it looks
you discover the crime
you call it in
youve got blood on your person and clothes and before cullen can cut him off and your prints are on the murder weapon
how do you know that
theres a second print in blood its a partial of a hand on the wall next to th i have keys
i called the cops from the house
i touched the goddamn wall
to barzoon i was panicked
we need twelve people who can see past all that
id get out in front of this fast
devils advocate rev
is that a crime
i touched the wall
hes right alex
people need to hear these things
youre not happy tomorrow
the next day
well move over
but right now this moment you need immediate representation
ive got a fourteen year old stepdaughter who i care more about than anything in the world
they wont let me call her from downtown
they wont let me talk to her after im out
i gotta go deal with that first
we need to issue a statement
cullen looks to milton
hes a winner alex
and theyll never see him coming
im gonna make some very tough phone calls
then im gonna take a pill and try to get some sleep
beat and you better be every fucking inch as good as you think you are
a woman with short dark hair her back to us looking in a shop window
her reflection in the glass its mary ann
shes cut and colored her hair
jackie and diana already going in and devils advocate rev
white wine and couture
mary ann holding a blouse
whispering this is three thousand dollars
know what you need to do
wear it once
and then throw it away
thatll loosen you up
i say spend it all
if youre never gonna see your husband you might as well have a relationship with his money
as she strips i swear if he wasnt afraid of me shooting my mouth off eddie wouldve put a cellulite clause in the pre nup
robert im telling you hes the miracle man
youve seen my new tits i mean who does it better than that
its not my tits im worried about
mary ann turns
jackie beside her
real or not
her breasts they look real
she shimmies they move real
trapped there must be real
thats the ultimate test
before mary ann can stop her jackie is taking her hand guiding it to her breast and holding it there
devils advocate rev
smiling feel real
pulling away absolutely
backing away dr
when youre ready
mary ann looking away as jackie walks off
everything is as it was and yet different
and then she turns and sees efx jackie pulling a dress down over her head
shes taking her time because its a delicate clingy
complicated outfit turning and for one brief moment we see a serpents head disappearing now into the dress as she struggles inside the material her body the body inside the
dress transforming ribs and spikes and huge moving muscles strain the limits of the material and then suddenly its over
jackies face appears
she straightens the seams
turning now what do you think
but mary ann is gone
thru thru devils advocate rev
kevin coming out a door with heath and an associate
first thing i need this asap i want articles clippings tv interviews i want everything you can get on alex cullen
walking off you better get a semi truck
christabella climbing the stairs
halfway up she stops to fix her stockings
congratulations on cullen
what an incredible situation even if you lose you become a star
what if i win
if you win
smiles if you win its everything
cullen is a pig
hes a pig beyond reasonable doubt
i suggest you keep him as far away from the jury as possible
ill keep it in mind
leans in whispering you can look all you want but i dont fuck married men
what a relief
i was starting to think you were perfect
devils advocate rev
he turns instantly pamela standing behind him
your wife is on the phone
she sounds upset
christabella smiling as kevin rushes off
mary ann very upset
kevin has just come home
i dont care if they can hear me

and these women my god
i mean im seeing things for crissake
you just left them in the store
look calm down all right
listen to me
first you do this radical thing with your hair

i think its fine
but i also think its traumatic
youve got the pressure of fitting in with new friends a new place
add three bottles of wine and no
it wasnt the wine
it wasnt the wine or my hair or talking to kathy because i know thats what youre gonna say devils advocate rev
what about kathy
what about her
shes pregnant again

kevin i never see you anymore

i dont know anybody here
these women scare the living shit out of me
if you can believe it im actually looking forward to having your mother come and visit
what about the apartment
you just go out you buy a few new suits and youre fine
ive got this whole place to fill up and i know we have all this money and its supposed to be fun but it isnt
its like a test
the whole thing is like one big test
lets make a baby
dont tease me
i wouldnt do that
unless you asked
you hate my hair dont you
his hand moves against her cheek and then down the back of her neck
she moves into his body and devils advocate rev
efx suddenly shes christabella right there in his arms before he can react before he can speak she finds his mouth and they are kissing and suddenly shes mary ann
and hes pulling up her dress and shes helping him and his hand is moving over bare thigh and devils advocate rev
efx suddenly shes christabella unbuttoning her blouse and she cant do it fast enough still with her mouth on his and his hand between her legs and suddenly shes mary
ann flattening against the wall and her blouse is open and efx suddenly shes christabella pulling off her bra as his mouth moves over her breasts and his hands are everywhere and the bra is gone and shes tearing at his shirt and hes helping her and her dress is on the floor and theres no rug or anything but this is where they will fuck because they cant stop themselves and shes on her back on the bare floor and hes kicking away his shoes and shes feeling herself and staring into his eyes and suddenly stop
kevin looks like hes been shot
in the balls
where are you
mary ann doesnt look so sure
kevin and pamela have been taking notes
cullen is exhausted frustrated
because it needs to be clear mr
cullen because i need to understand exactly what happened youre standing there you look down theres the gun devils advocate rev

its not something you plan for
two prints by the gun
its a strange move you mustve made to pick it up
the blood i dont know maybe i was trying to avoid the blood
im trying to picture it
contorting your hand came from inside and underneath
cullen reaches into his jacket and pulls out a gun
you want to see
dropping to his knees ill fucking show you
kevin watching cullen quickly retrieve the gun from the floor with this weird little motion
whose gun is that alex
devils advocate rev

cullen hands him the gun
lets wrap it up
so whats next
we need to talk to your assistant
you feel confident shell back you on the time
shes a real straight arrow
so were going to talk to her and youre not going to talk to anybody
with a smile no comment
devils advocate rev
a large ugly cube
daylight through dirty windows
on the table a large grey envelope
printed on it kevin going through a stack of crime scene photographs
one after another
we can see their horror in his face
panning along wall street
the whole downtown skyline
settling finally on the th floor of the law firm building
hovering at a distance
lights on here and there and one window
he and pamela are talking to a young woman
this is melissa block cullens assistant and alibi
we cant hear what theyre saying but it looks to be a collegial meeting
kevin and pam walking melissa out through the empty reception area
would my babysitter have to testify
we need her to establish the time you returned home
she doesnt have her green card is why i ask
i dont want her to get in trouble
devils advocate rev
tell you what melissa lets talk to her first
see where she stands and take it from there
ill make sure melissa gets down to the car
cullen didnt kill those people
thats why were all working so hard
as melissa exits with pam kevin notices two associates carrying boxes far up the hall and we paper shredders
half a dozen of them cranking full tilt
stacks of files left to go
barzoon and six associates working late
shirtsleeves and coffee
directing traffic okay excelsior insurance whos handling that
a hand goes up all this has to go
guatemala sudan cyprus

barzoon stops as he sees kevin in the doorway
i thought i was the only one working late

devils advocate rev
we just wrapped up with cullens assistant
she looks like a great alibi

kevin and milton standing near the door
right behind them three guys in the midst of an intense conversation in spanish

the subway rattling into the fourteenth street station

the doors open
big guy stumbling back his friends catching him helping him off the train looking back as the doors close and
its like it never happened
milton straightening his cuffs as the train pulls away
what did you say to him
i told him if he didnt leave us alone you were going to kick all three of their asses
devils advocate rev
right into it
red trunks with a huge right hand and blue trunks drops and the garden goes wild five thousand people yelling for blood
and milton at ringside breathing deeply of the vibe and on his feet get up

blue trunks rises on shaky legs as the bell rings the round over and the crowd groans back into its seats
milton turning as don king collars him
look at this sorry shit you got better seats than me

hang on a second
presenting kevin meet my new heavyweight
kevin shaking hands with don king as we serious flamenco
music is loud
the dancer is fantastic
milton sitting beside some blonde hes discovered hes got his jacket off clapping perfectly to the beat

he looks at the cigarette
takes a hit
and then his eyes find the dressing room across the hall
an open door
inside a woman one of the dancers all but nude stepping into her dress
a simply perfect body
and then she turns toward us and its christabella clearly for a single moment before she slams shut the door
kevin crosses to the door
the door opens
a dancer standing there
its not christabella

kevin already backing toward kevin moving toward the milton table
sitting down and just realizing that cullen has joined the party
devils advocate rev
milton catching kevins eye smiling as the blonde slips below the table
as if nothing were going on
thru thru dark
mary ann asleep in a chair
a breeze through the open terrace windows
suddenly she wakes
and then the sound of a baby crying
mary ann rushing through the dark toward the nursery and the sound of the crying stopping suddenly at the nursery door how
what are you
a one year old child sits naked on the floor amidst the tools and material

mary ann easing slowly forward

barzoon sitting alone at the defense table
federal prosecutor mitchell weaver on his feet
there is nothing vague or exploratory about this subpoena request your honor

its taken six months and seventeen separate motions and we still dont know whos responsible here
weve got a paper trail here that seems to stretch into eternity
cant turn over what you dont have your honor
weve been conducting a comprehensive search of our records and im sorry to say its a great deal less than mr
weaver would suggest
your honor this is outrageous
we need to get in there and seize these documents before theres nothing left
your honor its exactly these types of insulting accusations enough
both of you
put it on paper
ill read it
devils advocate rev
but the gavel comes down
barzoon packing up looks to the back of the room
kevin sitting there
lots of traffic
barzoon and kevin walking

kevin turns to see two more reporters jogging over
kevin just a statement and a photographer kevin under siege and backing away gotta go
barzoon escaping as reporters begin to materialize from all sides and we dark
mary ann in her chair

devils advocate rev

quietly conducting business as mary ann falls apart
kevin on a cell phone walking with milton
and she can take that during the day
beat no she wont be driving
beat im gonna have the pharmacy call you right back
hangs up sags against the car he thinks hes not sure he thinks it could be some kind of hormonal imbalance

devils advocate rev
kevin shes sick

its your wife man
and shes very sick
and thats gotta come first
beat are you telling me the possibility of leaving the case has never crossed your mind

ive got a winner here
i gotta nail this fucker down do it fast and put it behind me

i guess you have thought about it
i stand corrected
devils advocate rev
judge armand poe presiding
cullen seated with kevin and pam
the jury in their box
and prosecutor frank broygo on his feet just wrapping up his opening statement and when all that evidence is laid before you when all these pieces weave together you will
conclude you will know that alexander cullen is guilty of murdering three people in cold blood with malice aforethought
the courtroom is silent
the jury liked him
checking his watch we can break for lunch now or you can do a stop and start
if its a choice ill go now
i wont be as long as mr
we just spent our morning listening to mr
broygo talk about his evidence
what he neglected to tell you is what this case is really about
he left out the most important fact of all alex cullen was somewhere else when these murders took place
now alex cullen has done a lot of things i dont like
hes been a terrible husband to all three of his wives
hes been a destructive force in the lives of his step children
hes cheated the city
hes paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in penalties and fines over the years
i dont like those things
i dont expect you to like them
there will be other things during the course of this trial that you will hear about and like even less
but this isnt a popularity contest
its a murder trial and alex cullen hasnt killed anybody
devils advocate rev
the state is going all out here
theyve got a whole team over there
theyre throwing everything but the kitchen sink at this case
i need one thing from you
i need you to ask yourself is not liking this man reason enough to convict him of murder
beat enjoy your lunch
well talk again
stunned silence and then kevin thrown back against a wall what the fuck was that
are you out of your fucking mind
murderous they fucking hate me
kevin one push cullen sent flying
listen to me like youve never listened to anybody before
im going to bust my ass to make sure they hate you
because as long as youre out boning melissa youre not home killing your wife
pause as he warms to the idea why didnt you tell me before
then it doesnt look spontaneous
devils advocate rev
a forensic technician on the stand
a display chart beside him
blowups of the bloody hand prints
let me put it this way then can you tell from a blood sample if the person were alive or dead
of course not
and theres a two hour window in which to place these murders
so youve got absolutely no way to determine the condition of the victims when alexander cullen put his hand on that wall
kevin into the evening air carrying a bag of stuff
barzoon standing there in a jogging suit
saw you go in
devils advocate rev
its not over yet
im not talking about the trial
what are you talking about
how the fuck does your name get on the firms charter
looks like its been there for years
now youre a partner
when did that happen
i am still the managing director of this firm
you want my job
take me head on
backdoor me one more time and ill take your partnership papers and stuff em down your throat
i dont know what youre talking about but i sure as hell dont like your tone of voice
you got a problem with documents i suggest you put together one of your late night shredding sessions
you think youre tough enough to run this firm
backing away you tell milton next time weaver calls maybe i pick up the phone
kevin standing there watching him jog away as we kevin sitting there with his bag of groceries
milton looking sadly perplexed was he drunk
i doubt it
he was going running
what the hell was he talking about
eddies gotten himself into trouble again
and he wants me to save him
and i cant
why does he think im after his job
do you have any experience with manic depression
not directly no

milton already on the phone
punching a number
yes its me
beat get eddie barzoon
he may be out running so page him if you have to
its an emergency
hangs up turns back to kevin looks like you could use a drink
mary ann coming through the living room
she looks stoned
but moving with purpose
as if she were hearing something
opening the terrace doors and staring out over the park as we the reservoir entrance
its a nice night and busy with runners and bikes and barzoon comes jogging past
kevin has a vodka in his hand
wearily ive nursed him through two divorces a cocaine rehab and a pregnant receptionist
beat gods creature right
no leaves on the trees
breaking a sweat now
leaving the heavy traffic behind
ill tell you kevin because i know youre into theology
when youve seen when youve represented when youve dealt with as many people as i have over the years finally you say to yourself god mustve been awfully bored
devils advocate rev
the opportunity to fuck up
talk about entertainment value
into his pace
glancing down and on the horsepath below
three running shadows
side by side
just passing beneath an iron bridge
you take a look at eddie barzoon you gotta wonder if maybe god overplayed his hand
maybe he made the game a little too interesting
barzoon turns back stumbles catches himself sprinting now to the pump house
he pulls up here
resting as several other runners pass by
glancing back almost an afterthought and those three running shadows are now crossing the bridge which is completely impossible considering where they just were a moment ago and barzoon starts
running again instinctively faster than before glancing back and efx the three shadows
the sun setting behind them
transforming as they run animal shapes mixing with the harsh silhouettes of bare trees and devils advocate rev
barzoon freaked what the fuck was that
the park suddenly looking very empty and dark the three shadows and theyre closer and weirder and barzoon suddenly turning changing course leaving the path into the woods quickly ducking
down beside a huge sycamore tree
staring back out at the path three women runners clear as day pass beneath a streetlight
machine like strides
and then gone
barzoon stands from behind the sycamore tree
smiling at his own stupidity
what a jerk
heading back toward the path when suddenly theres an arm around his neck throwing him to the ground standing there above him a crazed looking homeless man hes white and
old and hungry gimme your watch
standing now you want the watch old man
come and get it
devils advocate rev
barzoon moving toward the old guy when crack
a tree branch swings out of nowhere catching his elbow snapping it back and a second homeless man
hes black and older than the first guy but just as wild and dangerous and hes winding up to swing the branch again and barzoon on his knees dazed blood
pouring from his head uncomprehending eyes watching these park creatures tear at his clothes efx watching them grow more feral and less human by the moment and mary ann staring out at the park
covering her ears against some horrible sound that she alone can hear
barzoon on his belly in the dirt trying to move crawl anything the two men beating barzoon to death with stones transforming with every blow efx as their hands descend
they become terrifying demonic creatures and as they rise we see them as men and over and over as we hear devils advocate rev
you take a look at eddie barzoon you gotta wonder if maybe god overplayed his hand
maybe he made the game a little too interesting
milton turns to find kevin staring at him
im gonna im gonna go downstairs now
put this stuff away
backing away with his bag of groceries ice creams already melting
milton watching him walk away as we pam exits the room
melissa sitting at the head of the table
kevin pacing around her
they are alone
practicing her testimony over early morning coffee
you testified that the defendant called you at four thirty to ask you to come to his office gym for the purposes of sex
cullen though hes not just your lover is he
hes the boss
so two hours go by before you act on his request
yes i went up at six ten
i knew it was six ten they had weather coming on the news
i remember cut off by okay
breaking character this prosecutor is no fool
hes gonna change tempo attitude tone of voice hes gonna come out with questions you never thought of just to screw you up
coaching so what do we do
yes and no answers
back into it is it your testimony ms
block that between the hours of six ten and nine forty you were engaged in sexual congress with the defendant
at any point during this three hour marathon ms
block did you lose sight of the defendant
did he use the bathroom
is he circumcised
silence you understand the question
so is he cut or not
which is it
melissa looks away
youve been polishing his knob three times a week for six months and you dont know whether or not hes got foreskin
total transformation ive had it up to here with this fucking game
why dont you take your questions and shove em up your ass
kevin staring at her
moving quickly for the door and into three steps out and he stops
people are out of their offices standing in the doorways
some of them crying
christabella rushes toward him into his arms oh kevin whats happened
what about him
he was killed
devils advocate rev
heath nearby has more answers last night in the park
he was running if you can believe it
kevin standing there holding christabella
feeling heat on the back of his neck and turning to find milton at the far end of the hall
their eyes lock what is wrong with people
at least they got the scumbags who did it
turning on this who
two old homeless crazies
pam coming through the hallway like steel kevin
kevin im sorry but youre due in court in thirty minutes

milton beside him
talking him down

alongside milton as theyre pushed along pam waving a cell phone fighting her way to kevin and kevin

an excess of flowers
organ music as foreplay
milton up front seating diana and children
kevin seated on the aisle
beside him jack heath
what do they say
they dont know
shes falling apart
do you have room for one more
kevin turns to see christabella standing beside him
jackies concerned expression blossoms into a private knowing smile now that kevin has turned away
christabella squeezes in as the music swells and the priest walks solemnly to the altar
kevin caught in a high intensity sexual cross fire between jackie and christabella
hes flipping out
milton passes on his way to the back
devils advocate rev
on one side the therapist on the other allesandra except she looks different than last we saw her
she could be all of seventeen

kevin staring at cullen and the girl
father husband partner friend colleague
efx cullens hand stroking at the back of the pew nothing outrageous except it does call to mind the hand of mr
gettys back in florida taken from us so suddenly
cullens hand moving with purpose stopping waiting as allesandra sits back and now his fingers find her skin stroking ever so subtly to contemplate evil
how it robs how it steals everything of value from us
cullen turns except its not cullen its gettys yes gettys whispering in allesandras ear and farther from gods purpose
kevin out of his seat
pushing past christabella rushing up the aisle and the greater that distance the greater evils pleasure
milton watching kevin flee the church
kevin hustling away behind him mr

wings begin to beat
expressions come alive
expressions of panic and fear and kevin really striding

kevin standing there across the street weaver smiles thinking hell talk now for sure stepping off the curb and tires screeching and weaver turning and a car trying to stop
and kevin watching as whamm
weaver ploughed onto the hood and a mother at the wheel her daughter beside her both screaming and the cars windshield as it crumples and kevin watching as the car
stops and weaver is dazed but alive his face buried in the windshield pulling himself up and weavers face through the shattered glass as he looks down to see mother and child efx transforming for an instant into monsters and weaver more terrified than hurt scrambling off the hood of the car staring back in horror and mother and child completely freaked out both of them hysterical and weaver holding his arm nose bloodied but moving backing away turning to find kevin still across the street and its gonna be okay
and then a big flat nose truck out of nowhere air brakes blasting as it just wipes weaver off the screen and kevin falling back flat against a wall staying
on kevin as the street comes alive with the sounds of emergency and he starts moving away and we devils advocate rev
kevin walking through stopping finally at an open door mary ann in a chair

and then the mirror shifts to find pam a monster efx her features horribly transformed in the glass and mary ann rears back her head smashing into pams face so
hard that the mirror shatters pam blind for a moment staggering back mary ann on her feet and fighting and pam suddenly pushed and pam standing there holding her face in pain as the glass door slams shut and whats going on
mary ann through the glass jamming a chair up under the doorknob kevin
kevin jogging down the hall trying the door devils advocate rev

kevin holding her but shes gone as we thru thru but someplace completely different
a fluorescent bulb sputtering out
and we know instantly that mary ann is dead
theres blood on his shirt
his eyes are raw
at his side a small suitcase containing her personal effects
more than grief more than shock what we notice most is his frighteningly grim determination
up ahead a bench
lomax huddled here
holding herself more tightly as he sets down the suitcase
i couldve packed that up for you
if he loses his steel hell drown
devils advocate rev
i wish youda let me help you
finish the story
off silence nineteen sixty four
youre in new york
theres a waiter in a restaurant
waiting finish the story
he talked to me
nobodyd ever really talked to me before
sixteen years old a thousand miles away from home somebody takes an interest
working so hard putting himself through school id never met anybody like that
knew the bible every word just knew it by heart
every meal there he was at my ear and i just
i didnt want that week to ever end
but it did
he came to say goodbye it was late and i started to cry and he said not to worry behold i send you out as sheep amidst the wolves
and that just stopped me cold because wed spent that whole day at bible study reading matthew ten and there was just no way for him to know about that
so i was
i took it as a sign
i let him in
and then everything was different
he was cruel
he was so cruel and i was so ashamed i thought id die
kevins eyes settle on the suitcase
i promised right there if god would let me back into his grace i would never leave again
i prayed there was a reason this terrible thing had happened
there had to be a reason
and there was
it was you
you were my blessing
you were reason enough to endure anything
how much i love you
i want to hear you say it
devils advocate rev
his face that night i knew it was him and the same time i was confused and you were so proud youd come to new york and done all this
on your own i didnt have the heart to tell you say it
desperate to finish you wondered yourself the apartment the money all this attention everything out of nowhere
hes your father
there it is out loud somehow he found us
tracked you down

we dont ever have to see him again
devils advocate rev
i cant do that

kevin disappearing down the stairs
lomax dropping to her knees as his footsteps echo away and we as kevin explodes through a fire door
pam standing there having a smoke
there you are
all smiles look at you
not to worry
hell take that fear away
you dont ever have to be frightened again
go on hes waiting
kevin turning and something is very wrong fifty seventh street is empty
just the building and the silence
turning back and pam is gone and then and then a wider angle it goes on and on
just now realizing the scale of miltons power
starting to walk as we the rooms only light coming from the huge bas relief
kevin steps off the elevator into the room
devils advocate rev
youre right about one thing
i have been watching
couldnt help myself
watching waiting holding my breath
but im no puppeteer kevin
milton appears out of nowhere
walking past kevin
i dont make things happen

i only set the stage
you pull your own strings
kevin has a gun cullens gun in his hand what did you do to mary ann
what did you do to my wife
on a scale of one to ten ten being the most depraved acts of sexual theater one being an average friday night run through at the lomax household id say
kevin fires the gun bang
bullets pass right through him into the wall whoa

what the hell do you know about love
devils advocate rev
bio chemically no different than eating large quantities of chocolate

theres only one real sickness in all of creation and that is self delusion
i told you to take care of your wife that the world would understand
and you made a choice
you know what scares me john
i leave the case she gets better and i hate her for it
you set me up
who told you to pull out the stops for mr
and moyez the direction you took snake handlers popes and swamis all feeding at the same trough whose ideas were those
and then cullen knowing hes guilty seeing those pictures putting that lying bitch on the stand
what did i say kevin
maybe it was time to lose right
you didnt think so

thats what i do
gotcha vanity is definitely my favorite sin
its so basic

its the goof of all time
look but dont touch
touch but dont taste
taste but dont swallow
and while youre jumping from one foot to the other hes laughing his sick fucking ass off
hes a tight ass
hes a sadist
hes an absentee landlord
incredulous worship that
efx the bas relief getting stranger and more seductive by the moment bodies spinning and spawning im here on the ground my nose in it since the whole damn thing
because i worship man himself
and its my time now
anybody want a drink
im having a drink

christabella begins to strip

that first line of cocaine
that walk into a strange girls bedroom
the jury coming back in thirty eight minutes

christabella passing kevin handing him her bra

christabella lingering and kevin leaning in
just a moment before she pulls away devils advocate rev
i wanted to fuck her from the minute we met
like thats wrong
like theres anything wrong with that
that there could be laws preventing something so natural
thats our ticket in
excited now did you know there were more students in law school right now than lawyers walking the earth
efx the bas relief has become an orgy bodies coming to life in a swirling narcotic haze and were coming out guns blazing
the two of you all of us acquittal after acquittal until the stench of it reaches so high into heaven it chokes the whole fucking lot of them
what we cannot legislate we will buy
what we cannot buy we will degrade
we will blow every fuse of enlightenment until it looks like a vandalized neon sign
and while god is busy at his peephole as he deigns us with his disapproval as he lumbers around his empty kingdom like some overfed colonial governor as god sleeps
late we will win
weve got a winner here kids
in the bible you lose
youre destined to lose
consider the source
christabella her hands moving over her body stop talking
both of you
reaching out kevin please
devils advocate rev
efx the bodies craning to watch as they roll by
urgently now kevin really please
shes right my son
its time to step up and take whats yours
kevin raises the gun to his temple quick and simple snap
hes blown his brains out milton stunned disbelieving for a moment and then an aura of fire and heat explodes around him nooooooo
efx kevin starting to fall in super slow motion and efx the room consumed with fire as the heat explodes around miltons body and efx kevin still falling and efx
christabella beating at the flames that now cover her body and efx kevin still falling and efx the bas relief
the clouds are now fire the bodies now burning and efx kevin still falling and efx milton as his clothes burn away as the heat eats away his features
efx as he becomes younger and younger and younger until suddenly efx for a moment
he is an angel
an instant of exquisite perfection amidst the flames
and then just as efx suddenly he explodes
and we efx the bas relief freezing instantly back into stone trapped in tortured agonizing finality
efx and then the whole thing just crumbling
stone raining down in tiny pieces and efx kevin in super slow motion as he falls the final few inches to the floor and at the moment of impact we
hear the sound of thunder and we the mirror
and kevins face
as thunder echoes away and becomes nothing more than a flushing urinal
were back in florida
where we started
kevin touches his face
he touches the mirror
water running in the sink
behind him it was a nice run
had to close out someday
nobody wins em all
the reporter exits
kevin alone with the mirror and his reflection
and then its over
hes made his decision
replacing his wedding ring
reaching for his jacket as we kevin walking through
his game face
a court officer opening the doors and kevin entering
standing there a moment
searching for heath in the back of the courtroom
hes not there
a single empty seat
kevin moving quickly down the aisle
mary ann standing there completely unprepared as kevin comes in behind her
holding her tightly to him with a fervor that we alone will understand
honey what are you doing
quietly are you okay
into his seat
gettys there beside him
kevin will not look at him
all rise for the honorable justice garson deeds
the judge enters
takes his seat
to barbara youre still under oath young lady
to kevin your witness mr
your honor im terribly sorry but i can no longer represent my client
i need to be replaced as counsel
but this one isnt very long
there will be chaos in the courtroom
gettys will freak out and the press will start running for the phones and the judge will be banging that gavel as we as the doors open and the chaos
begins to spill into the hallway
kevin trying to rush away with mary ann but right behind them kevin
catching up listen this story this is the one pal this is the one you dream about there is no story
a lawyer with a crisis of conscience

holding mary anns hand as they escape
the reporter watching them go for a moment
then turning back
efx and as he does his features change transforming like that into milton
and he smiles
and we freeze frame
