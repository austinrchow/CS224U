gothika by sebastian gutierrez december the woodward forensic institute wfi is a bed intermediate security treatment facility for male and female psychiatric patients
its primary clientele are those who have histories of committing criminal offenses and are either committed to the department of mental health by the circuit courts of the state or
who are admitted under authority of an appointed guardian
push in on a sleeping couple in the dark
the alarm clock reads am
the womans eyes open a second before the alarm beeps and turns it off
she grabs a glass of water on her bedside table and drinks it
climbs out of bed past typical bedside photographs wedding vacation etc
this is miranda grey sharp and prettier than she knows
miranda slides through the water
swimming cap on goggles
her steady breathing takes us in and out of the water
something unsettling about this sound
something slightly unsettling too about her detached manner
a person on autopilot recognizing only the water and the perfectly aligned lap stripes leading her path
like graphic metaphors for her own conscience flat
she emerges from the pool and self consciously wraps herself in a towel
miranda pays for a pair of coffees and a newspaper
mirandas husband douglas grey older a superficial analysis would suggest a father figure serves breakfast
miranda smiles thank you and goes back to studying a case file
he sips from his takeout coffee and reads the newspaper
a pleasant domestic scene
mirandas volvo pulls in as students amble up the steps
doug kisses his wife and hops out
students are already chatting him up as miranda drives off
mirandas car at some sort of guard gate
a buzzer lets her in
as the car drives past we read the plate on the wall
the gate shuts behind her with a certain finality as we
bookshelves packed with the according psychiatric tomes and diplomas
miranda faces a troubled young mess of a woman chloe charismatic deranged and forever trying to provoke
mid session this is your stepfather who came to visit you
beat i killed him
miranda tries not to act surprised at this breakthrough
responds with the even keel of a trained psychiatrist
thats the first time you admit it
theres a first time for everything
jotting this down it means youre finally past the denial stage
this is good chloe
i never killed anyone who didnt deserve it
you only killed your stepfather as far as i know
i shouldve taken care of my mother
she knew all along
you remind me of her
i remind you of your mother
always so put together
like you iron your underwear
like your pussy is the apricot of the promised land and the bread of the getting her back on track lets get back to your visitor last night
alright the devil
why would the devil visit you
its already hell in here what would he have to gain
he came to fuck an angel
giggles at that im his dirty angel
before miranda can analyze that one the room lights flicker and die
mirandas breathing speeds up
he grabbed me by the hair while i sucked him and usually i love that i just do maybe you can tell me why i love it so much but
not this time he was just too rough as suddenly as it went out now the power returns
a visibly uncomfortable miranda checks the clock
thats it until monday
try and get some sleep tonight okay
leans in crazy people hear messages from god
not the devil
you know that right
i didnt say you were crazy
you dont have to say it
she almost doesnt seem crazy when she says this
two orderlies appear at the door
miranda nods for them to escort chloe
chloe shakes their hands away from her strides off dramatically
the princess of the asylum
miranda locks her office armed with paperwork
the end of another workweek
pete graham a good ten years older and mirandas best friend on the job approaches
they walk along with the easy confidence of colleagues who not only respect each other but enjoy each other
power went out again in our wing
knows whats coming same here
its not shrink appropriate to be afraid of the dark you know
youre not shrink appropriate and youre about to get promoted
everybodys afraid of something
what am i afraid of
at least you should be
what are you up to this weekend
write a little country music decline invites to grand social events drink myself to sleep the usual
doug wants to look at some real estate up at willows creek
he thinks its fun
so is golfing im told
who was your six oclock
chloe mcgrath talk about trying to empty the ocean with a tea cup
shes a mess
i hear manhattans full of them
dont start with that
i already turned down the job
they have reached an office marked dr
phillip parsons director and peer in to see parsons s distinguished commands respect from everyone on the phone
he gestures for pete to sit
miranda is about to exit when he covers the mouthpiece miranda my wife keeps wanting to set that dinner with you and doug
are you free tonight
hes stuck at a school board meeting
parsons looks through his appointment book
youve been here a year already dorothys starting to take this personal
hows next wednesday
next wednesday it is phil
he nods at her with a smile and returns to his phone call
miranda drives off leaving the majestic grounds behind
a guard waves her off
miranda slows down at the sight of colored lights up ahead
a knocked down telephone post blocks the road
emergency vehicles at the scene
a patrolman waves her down
sheriff ryan s recognizes her and ambles over
anybody hurt sheriff
nah telephone post just decided to fall
itll take us a while to clear this up so im afraid youre gonna have to take the long way home miranda
if you say so
and tell your husband he owes me a phone call
wouldnt want him in trouble with the authorities
that a girl
the law never sleeps and all that
you take care now
he taps on her hood and heads back to the site
she shifts into reverse and makes a u turn
miranda drives down the curvy road toward an old bridge
something definitely creepy about this deserted place miranda dials a number on her cell phone gets the machine
into phone hi its me
are you there
pick up pick up
im on my way but i just got detoured so im
a bump on the road makes her drop the phone on the passenger seat
she reaches for it and when she looks up we see a teenage girl stands smack in front of us
about to get pummelled by us
miranda swerves to avoid her and slams into the railing
metal screeches as she struggles to regain control of the car and finally brakes to a halt she looks in her rearview mirror the girl is standing back there
drunk or high or in any case completely out of it
into phone stay on the line
dont go anywhere
the weirdest thing just the phone cuts out hello
she stares at the dead phone
punches the buttons on it
she tosses the phone on the seat and hops out of the car
miranda cautiously approaches the girl who is now not moving
just standing there
her back to us
are you hurt
as we get closer we see she is covered in bruises
clearly something horrible has happened to her
were you in an accident
were you attacked
its okay im a doctor
beat my name is miranda grey
and now she turns
young seventeen tops
busted lip black eye
miranda pulls off her coat wraps it around the girl youre in shock right now thats perfectly natural
im going to get you to the hospital
the girl suddenly grips mirandas arm
dont be scared
its going to be fine
now the girl is touching mirandas face
her movements desperate smothering
like the movements of a drowning person
miranda tries to push the girls hands back down
hands off me okay
tell me your name do you remember your name
the girl tries to speak but no words come out
instead she produces a strained wettish sound
creepy as hell
and now she is prying mirandas mouth open and shes much stronger than expected and miranda is panicking
what are you doing
im trying to help you
the girl opens her own mouth wide like a snake
and as miranda muffles a scream blood starts leaking out of the girls eye sockets and from wounds all over her body
miranda wakes up in a cold sweat
just a bad dream
faint at first but growing louder we hear a repetitive sound outside
like an echo of some sort but vaguely familiar thwip thwip thwip
miranda takes a deep breath reaches for the glass of water on her bedside table
its not there
she turns to her husband but hes not in the bed
and now she glances around the room and realizes this is not her bedroom
she climbs off the bed and walks in the dark
trips over something
a tray that clangs loudly
her heartbeat goes haywire
she feels her way along the wall to a small opening in the door
a glass pane
she peers through the glass at the empty corridor outside realizing what this must mean realizing shes inside a cell
she jiggles the handle and pounds on the door frantic hello
somebody help me
camera soars through the tall iron gates past the guard
now we spot the source of our continuing thwip thwip sound sprinklers watering the impressively kept gardens
the expansive complex is more victorian campus than drab prison with separate wings male and female research units libraries gym and volunteer outpatient center
a bored group of female patients listen to a social worker lecturing them
a janitor mops a long corridor
patients study at the library under the watchful eye of orderlies
a doctor and two orderlies hold down a patient having an epileptic fit well soon know her as shelley
they force a biting block in her mouth to avoid her swallowing her tongue prepare a syringe
institute director phil parsons at a meeting with other doctors discussing a patients progress on a chart
now we are moving up the main buildings wall and through large windows into pete rushes up two steps at a time passing by a nurse with a cart of
meds who nods respectfully as he goes an orderly unlocks the door for pete
through the glass pane he can see a visibly upset miranda arguing with the head nurse a tough as nails woman in her s irene
sleeping beauty is awake
peter forces a smile enters peter what the hell is going on
pete nods at irene its okay hell take it from here
how do you feel
how do you think i feel
is this a joke
peter is half listening to her half signaling to the nurse with the meds to come in
miranda catches all of this growing more agitated
she wears the uniform all patients wear a white t shirt and sweats
her wedding ring is gone
what are you doing
giving you something to calm down
i dont need to calm down
what i need is an explanation pete grabs the meds from the nurse
irene and the attendant step closer to help
miranda feels them closing in on her
peters tone is infuriatingly gentle just take this and we can sit down and chat
why here why not in my office
she looks at the silent faces around her
or maybe too much sympathy
either way its unnerving
i dont want an anticonvulsant at least give me valium
nods at nurse fifty milligrams
jesus christ youre gonna knock me out
final offer twenty
the nurse complies
miranda stares at the meds trying desperately to put this into some kind of perspective
how would you feel if you woke up in a goddamn cell dressed like this
we can discuss it at length after you take your meds
awkward nods from irene the nurse and the attendant
pete holds mirandas gaze
miranda takes her meds
this better be good
pete motions for the others to leave them alone
one by one they file out and lock the door behind them
alone with pete she is even more upset
miranda this is very awkward
technically i shouldnt even be treating you but the court has granted us a waiver until youre transferred
so whatever is said here wont leave this room
i wont tell parsons i wont tell anyone
i want to talk to my husband
you cant to that
sit down please
try to relax
why would i pretend to be in any way relaxed
i understand youre upset
but we need to put some things in order
two massive understatements
he hesitates unsure where to begin
how long have you been here
laughs what is this
why are you doing this to me
just answer the question
hi my name is miranda grey
im a psychiatrist
i transferred here to the woodward forensic institute a little over a year ago
my job entails dealing with a ward of schizophrenic women between the ages of eighteen and fifty fife i dont mean how long youve worked here i mean how long
youve been staying here
this stops her
wanting desperately to whip out a comeback but realizing she doesnt know the answer
im a doctor yes
or was medical school just an elaborate dream
of course youre a doctor
a great doctor in fact
the hint of sadness in his voice alarms her
pete how long have i been here
barely audible what
you were admitted to the neurosurgical unit seizing violently
that lasted three days
scans revealed left sided weakness numbness and severe fontal lobe deficits
miranda shakes her head in disbelief but we miranda seizing violently from her pov doctors struggling to contain her
arms thrashing legs
flashes of the wall the floor
head crashing against a cart out of control
you came out of it and tested negative for pcp underwent extensive hypnosis and received amytal injections
flash miranda being tied down
a nurse with a syringe she looks down at her wrists with the reddish marks
you were tied down for a day and a half so you wouldnt hurt yourself and then you went into a state of well how to put this
youve been pretty much catatonic
beat this is the first time you speak
reality sinking in
doug must be worried sick
i need to call him pete shakes his head emphatically
youre the most logical person i know bar none
plus you have a photographic memory unconfirmed but you do remember events and phrases more accurately than anyone around
why am i telling you this
youre establishing my personality as fairly intellectual you dont consider me impulsive or emotional
and thats a fair assessment no
yes thats fair
and following this pattern of analysis were about to discuss a traumatic event that rendered this psychological profile useless correct
two hundred percent
a pause here
hes waiting for her to continue
shes not used to being on the other side of the therapists table
you think im in denial
that im putting on a brave show that this is a cover for some unbearable emotion im hiding
dont analyze yourself just focus on remembering
i remember friday night after work if you say that was five days ago pushing on anyway i asked you what you were doing for the weekend and you said
the usual and you made a joke about writing country songs and drinking yourself to sleep and i told you i was going to look at some real estate in willows creek with doug
and then what
then i drove home
and then what
i got home i guess and had dinner by myself because pauses struggling because doug had an alumni meeting at his school and he was going to get a ride
hes the principal now as you well know
she stops here
the silence is deafening
she pushes on but her hands shake a little
but wait there was an accident before that wasnt there
a girl she had been beaten
i took her to the hospital right
there was indeed an accident you were detoured by the cops
but theres no report of any girl
no the cops werent there
they were back on main road
a knocked down telephone post correct
miranda is all foggy on the details i saw the girl after that
she was bleeding
sway in the night breeze with their gentle tinkling sound more menacing than joyful a breathless miranda wipes her face leaving a thick streak of blood on it
we scour her every blood vessel iris pupil
filling the screen and now we distinctly make out an eerie shape reflected inside of it
but just for a sec the teenage girl
what about your husband what can you tell me about him
miranda shakes the puzzling images out of her head excuse me
whats the last memory you have of him that night
frowns tell me nothing happened to doug
lets backtrack a second
you left your office you were driving home you got detoured by the police did you call someone on the phone that night
i dont know
i might have
who would you call
i might have called doug to tell him something
or checked my answering service
were you seeing someone else that night
i beg your pardon
there was some trouble in your marriage wasnt there
of course not
she shakes her head emphatically as we camera pans across the large space to find miranda and a man whose face we dont see kissing heatedly
miranda chases the disconcerting image out of her head
there was no trouble in my marriage i dont know what stops herself there is no trouble in my marriage
you just used the past tense why
his face says he doesnt know how to tell her
did something happen to doug
you dont remember anything else
anything at all
frustrated she snatches his cell phone and starts to dial this is preposterous
whats wrong with doug
this stops her cold
time stands eerily still
she stares at pete as if by looking at him long enough he will contradict his statement
no hes not
dont tell me that
dont tell me that
sickened are you sure
painful beat you killed him
irene and two nurse rush to mirandas cell
we hear her hysterical cries from inside
pete struggles to contain miranda who howls disparagingly
its going to be alright miranda
you just need to sleep
its going to be alright off petes nod a nurse injects the syringe into mirandas arm
they hold her down with great effort as she continues to cry and we
a blur of images and scrambled snippets of memories come at us rapid fire like a drug induced dream mirandas car screeches to a stop and she jumps out glances
school principal douglas grey shakes hands with proud parents and clumsily formal students
miranda grabs a drink from a nearby tray bored
re her drink is that number three
special occasion im celebrating how proud i am of my husband tonight
he smiles weakly at the compliment
moves his hand towards her in an affectionate gesture or so miranda thinks but instead fixes her bra strap
miranda and a man exit the theater
doug laying on the floor covered with bloodstains
bloodstained axe on floor in f
walls covered with bloodstains
a flustered miranda fumbles with her purse and keys heads for the door
she tries to fix her smeared lipstick and messed up hair
turns to camera im sorry
the fact is im married and i this is not me this is a mistake
first we hear our mystery mans voice then we see him pete
yes the same person she kissed and went to the movies with
he places his hand on the door blocking her
your marriage is the mistake and you know it
that was out of line
i feel like a school kid hiding from the principal
we are hiding from the principal
touches her face tenderly
a person used to doing the right thing but not liking that at the moment
i would just like to spend some time together
we spend time together every day
i meant minus the schizophrenic women
i have to go
i need time to think
opens the door for her
she starts to walk away
dont be too hard on yourself dr
you havent done anything wrong
but i want to
push into a quiet house on a quiet suburban street
two volvos parked in the driveway
perfectly kept front lawn
another near subliminal glimpse of doug laying on the floor covered with bloodstains
bloodstained axe on floor in f
walls covered with bloodstains
miranda and doug laugh at their wedding
its clearly hot because she wipes sweat off his brow with a handkerchief
a breathless miranda wipes her face leaving a thick streak of blood on it
she looks down at her hand noticing the blood and now we are back in miranda wakes up with a start
the darkness renders the room almost void of any color
it takes her a moment to orient herself
her eyes wander across the unfamiliar room feeling like shes being watched
we become aware of a ragged breathing sound
like somebody is standing over her bed
but we dont see anything
miranda gingerly crosses to the door and peeks through the glass partition into the empty corridor
she glances back at the room stills seeing nothing and bangs on the door
can i get some assistance here
bangs on the door again
and now finally we hear footsteps approaching
a light is switched on down the corridor
the footsteps get closer
miranda tries to appear composed
wipes sweat off her forehead
fixes her hair
the footsteps now stop right out side the door
a key goes into the lock and jiggles it
miranda waits for the door to open but nothing happens
confused she steps up to the glass partition and peeks the second her face touches the glass she is met by a pair of piercing eyes
the eerie teenage girl
miranda jumps back screams
and when she looks up again the image is gone
rational thought kicking in to self wake up wake up
beat youre dreaming
its not real
an anxiety dream thats all
this is dream logic
if it was real they would have heard you scream
there are twenty employees on the night shift
at least twenty
she props herself with her back against the wall
with a view of the whole cell
just in case
staring at the door
im just dreaming
and now faintly at first but growing louder footsteps can be heard approaching outside
just like before
im dreaming im dreaming im dreaming im dreaming
like her life depends on that mantra
the footsteps get closer
and her voice begins to falter voice rising im dreaming im dreaming and now the footsteps pause outside her door like before and she holds her breath horrified when suddenly
we are hit with the sudden glare of returning light
everything flashes white and then color returns rise and shine ladies
irene tries to shake miranda awake
an orderly and nurse stand by
shaking her that means you honey
rise and shine now
she shakes her harder
and now mirandas eyes shoot open and she grips irenes arm
like the teenage girl did
easy now its okay
miranda stares at her coming back to
starts to speak but has no voice
clears her throat i need to see peter graham
and you have a session scheduled this afternoon right now
hes not even in yet now let go my arm honey
doctor grey if you dont mind
actually i do mind
i start calling you doctor and everybody else wants to be called doctor please
its a bit different wouldnt you say
irene reaches out her hand and the nurse places a cup with meds on it
what do you think youre doing
i want to speak to my lawyer wait what are you doing
irene shoves the meds into mirandas mouth cmon irene dont do this
im calm now look im calm
she struggles as they hold her down and irene sedates her
drifting past the female patients at their usual activities
some watch tv play dominoes some pretend to read some stare out blankly
heres chloe at a table engaged in some sort of trivia game with a tattooed southern redhead named jenna mallorol matzine megaphen meallaril s meleretten meleril mellaril mellaril s mesoridazine
methotrimaprazine mixidol moban modalina
isnt that a band
trade name for triflupoerazine
look it up
chloe shrugs if you say so
jenna resumes moditen molindone moltipress motival
thats it for the ms
high potency neuroleptics starting with j
theres only jatroneural
what do you wanna bet
bet you a soda
chloe checks a reference book
right on the money cowgirl
twenty points and a soda
camera follows her intent gaze to another patient shelley the same patient we saw earlier mid fit moseying across the room
nervously takes a seat beside miranda
hi there doc
it takes a moment for the heavily drugged miranda to react
she looks up slowly eyes glazed painfully out of it
i never got shrinked by you but all i hear is nothing gets past you i mean thats just hearsay and i dont pay much attention to hearsay because now
they say you hacked your husband with an axe but i say maybe it just slipped right
miranda notices shelley is toying with a wrinkled newspaper clipping
shelley catches this look and slides it over to her
without malice like a child
they put your picture in the paper
it reads school principal slaughtered
wife under arrest
photos of miranda douglas their house
miranda stares at it in disbelief
how did you get this
who knows how
around here im on a need to know basis about stuff and most stuff i dont need to know
my point is about people talking behind other peoples backs
like before i was here everything i did i thought thisll get them wanting their approval wanting them to say good things behind my back
but now im more anonymous more myself
miranda slides the clipping back to shelley clueless as to how to get out of this conversation but shelley has no problem holding a conversation all by herself youre not
like undercover here are you
they pulled that at spring grove had a bunch of doctors pretend they were patients see if they could handle it
most quit after day one
youre not are you
im not undercover
because if you were im like the fort knox of secrets
thats good to know
but im not
say no more
sotto i understand perfectly
she hands miranda paper and some crayons whispers drawing is a great cover
good luck to you
with a wink shes gone
miranda looks at the room around her chloe spying on her in the corner irene and the nurse sharing a laugh other patients ambling about arguing life among the insane
patients undress in the bare bones locker area
an uneasy miranda is handed a bar of soap and towel by irene
i dont i think im alright
you go in last because youre special
off mirandas look its not a mexican prison toots
everybody here minds their own business
if its all the same id rather state law says we keep you ladies clean
and im a stickler for the law
beat now come on
if you go downtown you gotta dance
miranda studies the patients already under the spray of the shower
something vaguely concentration camp like about institutional bathing
the shower like everything else in this place is regulated by shifts so that various groupings of patients each get their turn
miranda feels chloes gaze on her across the room
she is stripping off her clothes for mirandas benefit gleefully mangling the last refrain from the stones start me up
checking watch thats five minutes group one
to chloes group alright ladies nice and easy
the first group of bathers file out dripping wet past miranda in all shapes and sizes
she registers their many scars and tattoos like maps of troubled souls names of men places religious quotes
burn scars cuts needle marks
they begin to towel off as miranda slowly and painfully self conscious begins to undress in the corner
a moment later irene nods for her to go in
miranda hangs her head under the spray and closes her eyes trying to shut it all out
the sounds slowly fade out until all we have is miranda and her ragged breathing
chloe and shelley the last two out from the previous group grab towels
chloe winks at miranda when she catches her staring but miranda is not staring at her
she is staring past her at the tile wall
more specifically at a hole in the tile where a busted water pipe pokes out
clearly at some point there was a handle there but now it is just a hole with a busted pipe
push into the hole to see a perfectly formed globule of blood emerge following by a gurgling sound which seems to come from deep in the bowels of the plumbing
the blood lingers tentatively as if unfamiliar with the laws of gravity before tracing an upward line along the tile
the gurgling grows louder closer and now more blood flows from the hole and spreads up the wall
miranda looks away disturbed and now realizes she is the only one left in the showers
shuts her eyes
to self it isnt real
it isnt real
opens her eyes
five letters are written in blood
n o t a l
shaking nauseous she looks down at her feet and the drain too scared to look back up
to self it isnt real
but now blood drips by her ankle drip drip drip
and the shooting pain she feels is coming from her arm
what the hell
we see sharp slashes appearing on her skin like some invisible knife is slicing her
hallucination or not she bolts out of the showers miranda wraps a towel around her bloody arm too freaked out to process anything
fumbles for her clothes and heads straight to shelley tying her shoelaces muttering
and pick up those damn cigarette butts
jesus tv is dumb shelley can you do me a favor
shelley fixes her with an intense conspiratorial look
the housewives will find something better to do
can you go in the shower and tell me if you see anything on the wall
shelley doesnt respond
simply crosses over and heads for the showers
miranda gets dressed when a hand on her shoulder makes her jump
enough privacy for you
thank you irene
but now irene notices the blood seeping through the towel
what did you do
its nothing what the hell did you do to yourself
and now the other patients are curiously watching as orderlies rush in to haul her away
through a glass pane we see a nurse bandaging mirandas arm
parsons and irene confer just outside the room
i looked away for a second
its unacceptable wont happen again
not your fault
patients always find a way to hurt themselves if thats what they want
i just didnt peg her for a cutter thats all
parsons watches miranda through the glass
she cant look him in the eye
miranda with her fresh new bandage ignores the looks from the other patients as she rejoins them
spots shelley by the window furthest from the wardens
oh my god
oh my god
you saw it
some people they have a gift
and in here because they categorize us as a bunch of schizos they refuse to acknowledge that
its like that hubble telescope that sees things a trillion miles away but what its seeing is just reflected light of a star that died a thousand years ago
its like that
doesnt mean youre crazy
it only means your eyes open in a different way
miranda tries to follow the convoluted explanation but has a sinking feeling
what did it say
on the telescope
did you see anything shelley
shelley glances around to make sure no one can hear
thats not tile that wall is made out of
its a holographic screen
all part of your mission isnt it
miranda shakes her head feeling foolish
taps her forehead this is all we have
the rest is dust
pete and miranda stare at each other
a tense beat
it was you i called that night
did you mention that to the cops
i didnt think it would help you
what does that mean
it means they wouldnt have let me treat you if they thought i had any kind of involvement in what happened
and did you
did i what
did i make it to your place
did i see you that night
we got disconnected and i couldnt get through to you
i sat there waiting all night
figured youd changed your mind
why didnt you tell me this before
because the only way youll be able to accept these events is if you remember them on your own
my job is to assist you in processing that information because youre not in a frame of mind to do it by yourself
she stares at him
youre changing the subject
the subject is you dont trust me
right now i dont trust anyone
she tries to read his face
reminds herself of who pete is and what he means to her
he points at her bandaged arm
you want to talk about today
she takes a resigned breath slowly shakes her head
wishing she could wake up from this nightmare i want to talk to my lawyer
i think thats premature
i cant help what you think
sprinkler systems doing their thing thwip thwip thwip
the female patients are out in the gardens for their freshly dose of air
boom down to miranda alone at a bench
a cigarette appears before her being offered to her you a marlboro girl
miranda sees jenna looming above her shielding the sun
i dont smoke thanks
all we have is our health cupcake
sits beside her what i do is quit constantly start again
drives them all crazy
one day i quit three times
jenna lights her smoke blows out the match slowly
miranda turns and checks the building entrance as jenna rambles on
they allow me one match at a time and pretend theyre not watching
check it out salivating goon number one at three oclock oh so inconspicuous goon number two at five oclock
miranda follows jennas gaze
sure enough shes being closely watched by two orderlies
what did you set on fire to wind up here
very perceptive doc
i burnt down the building where i worked
i found a baby at the doorstep called the cops of course the bottom feeding pricks never showed
its beside the point really
god knows what jenna is talking about but who is she to say
once again miranda checks the building entrance and now sees parsons emerge
she rises phil
he keeps walking
headed to the parking lot beyond
his first instinct is to smile
but he checks himself reminding himself of her new status
slips into his best professional face hello miranda
i wonder if i could talk to you
checks his watch well actually im about to
your staff meetings done and thursdays you dont schedule sessions until the afternoon
this will just take one minute
she remembers his schedule perfectly
points but the sheriff wants to ask me some questions
she follows his look to the parking lot where sheriff ryan emerges from his patrol car
its about pete
what about him
perhaps hes not the most qualified person to be treating me
his tone is fatherly yet direct
are you complaining about his methods or are you referring to the nature of your past relationship with him
this surprises her
what did he tell you
he explained there might be a conflict of interest because he has feelings for you
you two engaged in a kiss at one point
am i right
i told him were all grownups here and the fact is hes the best doctor on my staff
as such and given the severity of the charges you face i consider him the most qualified person to assist your recovery
now if youll excuse me sheriff ryan is not a patient man
stonewalled in the simplest of ways shes left feeling like an idiot
watches parsons join the sheriff by his car
the two men shake hands when suddenly irene runs past her yelling hey
now two orderlies race past
miranda looks over to see what the fuss is all about
chloe is on top of an institute staff member we havent seen before a round black woman named consuelo
punching her other patients have crowded around the scuffle
you fucking cow giving me the evil eye huh
fuck you you fuckin voodoo witch
irene and the orderlies yank chloe off consuelo
chloe kicks and screams like an animal
consuelo meekly stands up
heavy cuban accent is okay shes okay she dont mean nothing
you bet your goddamn fat ass i mean it youre a witch
mcgrath thats enough
the orderlies start pulling chloe away
chloe spits at consuelo full of venom
take your voodoo shit back to cuba i said thats enough
irene shes okay
pobrecita la infeliz
its a misunderstanding
i was only trying to help her you wanna help me
you pity me
grabbing her crotch suck me
the orderlies haul chloe off
irene disperses the crowd
consuelo sighs embarrassed wipes a bloody lip
her manner says she just wants to get back to her duties
excitement over the patients resume whatever it is they were doing
miranda stares at her bleak surroundings when something catches her eye pete watching her from his office window
he quickly slides the curtain shut
a sunny sky grows dark as night envelops us with a swoosh slow push down empty corridors
the air thick with dread miranda cries softly unable to sleep
voices trickle in from the corridor outside wardens on their rounds a soft moan from another cell a random scream
she shuts her eyes repositions herself on her stomach
as before somebody seems to be watching her
irene escorts miranda into the library
a warden follows
how are we feeling today
sorry i asked
doesnt seem like the best choice of words when treating schizophrenics
fitting right in arent you
the library is pretty much empty at this hour except for the librarian and the odd janitor tidying up
an efficient looking man rises from a desk briefcase in place glass of water this is attorney theodore miranda
irene checks her watch
the warden hangs back keeping watch
shes due back in the rec room in twenty counselor
thank you kindly
waits until irene is out of hearing range
teddy i know you knew doug well and this is an extremely im here as your lawyer
so whatever my relationship was with doug is no longer of consequence
first things first how are they treating you
like im crazy
you know this place better than anyone
anything out of the ordinary
other than me being crazy
the da is pushing for a hearing as soon as next week
theyre eager to resolve this situation because well crimes like this dont happen that often around here
doug was a hometown boy whod done good beloved high school principal a role model
our best shot scratch that our only shot is to claim temporary insanity
as he speaks she starts fidgeting with her itchy bandage
wait wait wait teddy you know me
i wouldnt raise a hand at my husband for the life of me
not even in self defense
isnt it remotely possible a burglar broke in or some crazed high school student attacked doug and i went into shock
teddy shakes his head
youre telling me theres no other suspects in anyones mind
neighbors heard screams
they have you at the scene they have the murder weapon and they have your prints everywhere
the only thing they dont have is motive
she keeps absently playing with the bandage
the adhesive is giving
the bandage starting to peel off
because there is no motive
and thats whats confusing them
the fact that youre a brilliant psychiatrist doesnt help either
it fills their heads with ideas
they figure if you were to plan a murder you might know how to fake insanity to get out of it
she pulls off half the bandage back and forth
but we see the beginning of a pattern in her scarred skin im not faking anything
i pass no judgment either way
the point is the point is im the only person who doesnt believe i killed my husband
i never thought id say this but i feel like im in the middle of a conspiracy
beat do you believe im crazy
an uncomfortable teddy takes too long before answering
miranda looks down humiliated and now she sees it
perfectly carved into her arm her scar reads petrified miranda jumps back knocks down teddys glass of water all over his papers her chair topples over
the warden and janitor look up teddy tries for delicate
it doesnt matter what i believe
forget i asked
push into her face as involuntary tears roll down and we miranda
pete trying hard to get through
we get a good look at the writing on her arm
the right arm
i cant help you if you dont talk to me
silence from miranda
he is firm but not unkind i can stand here all day
youre the one running out of time
he goes to touch her arm
she jerks it away
what does it mean
she shakes her head at a loss
torn between her suspicion and the need to confide in someone
finally i didnt write this
they stare each other down
theres definitely chemistry between these two
but the moment is far from romantic
youre going to have to trust me
because no matter whats going through your mind right now i havent done anything wrong
then you know exactly how i feel
he starts to speak stops himself
their banter escalates in speed as their terms get more clinical you admit youre having a hard time differentiating whats reality from whats hallucination right
so isnt it at least possible that as a doctor i agree with you
maybe and this is a big maybe all of this is just a deep epilepsy that extends to the limbic structures but im telling you how about this moment right
what about it
is this a hallucination
you tell me
but i do know what i sound like
paranoia is the ultimate awareness right
which is why i suggest we simply increase your dose until venom no
he steps back at her blowout
she catches the look on his face and forces herself to sit down
is there any way we can pretend that didnt just happen
beat struggling i want to believe you
so ill take your word for it youre not involved in this but you take mine i didnt write this and i didnt kill my husband
he studies her
new tactic alright
lets say you didnt write this number one im right handed
number two i would have had to bring an x acto knife into the shower to do this wouldnt i
pete tries to reserve judgment
her argument has a certain loopy logic to it
he hesitates then pulls a series of photographs from a manila envelope
i think its time you look at these
miranda looks at the crime scene photos
heres part of dougs body
heres the axe
and now she sees a closeup picture of the wall with words on it
in blood a la manson family
and it says miranda immediately tosses it away from her
repulsed miranda furiously writes on the wall with blood
wipes her face breathlessly leaving a thick red streak on it
you wrote that
any idea why
panic rising no i didnt
no i didnt
pete retrieves the photograph off the floor and holds it up for her to study again
youre the only person who can figure out what this means
try to remember
stop holding back
she nods meekly
staring at the picture
begins to shake as all of it finally comes flooding in a breathless miranda wipes her face leaving a thick streak of blood on it
she looks down at doug crawling on hands and knees
he moans horribly in shock
she grabs the heavy axe from the floor and follows him
he reaches for the coffee table with the telephone on it and makes a move to grab it
he has all the speed of a dying turtle and thats pretty much what he resembles
miranda bites her lip lifts the heavy axe with both hands
dougs hand grabs the phone
miranda swings the axe over her head and it comes down straight at camera
miranda wipes her face again catches her reflection in the mirror over the mantel and stares we hear that sound
the wettish gurgling sound
miranda stares at the mirror looking for the source of it
for an instant we see the teenage girls reflection there beckoning
but now shes gone and miranda is left studying her own demented expression and now flames rise around her
she looks down at her feet no fire
blood on her clothes axe still in her hands
looks back up at shows a serene expression on her face
fire enveloping her
she slowly lifts her hands over her head
in place of the axe there are chains attached to shackles on her wrists
she is completely naked as if purified like an extreme version of anima sola
a biblical icon in which a woman in fiery purgatory awaits her fate
time stands still for a mesmerizing moment when the mirror shatters to pieces and were back to reality
miranda stares at the axe shes flung at it
miranda tries to wash off the blood in the sink
this is a daunting task seeing as how shes covered in it
she stares at her bloody footprints all over the floor at the marks on the door handle towels and wall
gasping for breath almost crying she turns on the shower at full blast and climbs into the tub
she watches the blood wash off her
as if finally coming back to her body and realizing what shes done she slowly slides down the shower wall and curls up in the tub
she shuts her eyes as hard as she can to make it all go away and we silence
and now faintly at first but growing progressively louder we hear the sound of buzzing flies
miranda wakes up still in the tub
how long has she been there hours
impossible to know
but at some point she must have turned off the water
she sits up every muscle of her body aching hair caked with blood
the first thing that hits her is the stench
and its foul the putrid smell of decaying flesh
she steps gingerly out of the tub onto the flooded floor and follows the trail of blood mortified at what she will find
soon enough the press will make the manson family reference but for now only miranda is here to witness the fruit of her labor
she gasps for air
instead she is hit by a wave of nausea
she doubles over to throw up when there is a frantic rapping at the front door
voices and yells trickle in
the hinges on the door rattle under repeated pounding and she still stands there as the first fireman breaks in
sheriff ryan and his deputies right behind
a concerned pete graham behind them
the cops take one look at the place and raise their guns at her but we cant hear what theyre saying because mirandas ragged breathing has taken over the soundtrack
suffice to say that at the sight of the guns something clicks inside her and she turns on her heel and flees she slips on blood nearly falls as she
scrambles to the bedroom she locks the door behind her hyperventilating in terror
instantly there are men pounding on it
orders barked at her
she spots two officers through the window in her backyard
about to smash the window
a caged animal completely surrounded she covers her face with her hands
the doorknob jiggles violently about to give
and when she brings her hands down she is staring straight into the teenage girls face
and she opens her mouth wide and now we are back in miranda gasps for air drowning in sensory overload
oh god oh god oh god
she rocks back and forth
finally aware of what shes done
she is the killer
no more doubts
and now that she knows everything is much worse
a long harrowing beat
we push in on her devastated face
night turns to day
the locks are unlocked
pete appears at the door
miranda glances up at him
she looks like a different person
he crouches beside her
she shakes her head slowly
he sets his hand on her shoulder
she turns to him and hugs him tight holding on for dear life
breaks down in sobs
parsons leafs through mirandas file
pete stands by the window lost in thought
how much does she remember
it all came flooding back last night
more like an uncontrollable reminiscence
intense over cathected
shes not feeling guilty of her actions not exactly
sounds to me like last night she actually re lived them in great detail
hypermnesis following amnesia
could a specific epileptic element be involved
thats exactly what she suggested
even in her present state her instincts remain impeccable
id like to talk to her
pete escorts a fragile miranda down the corridor
the two orderlies walking ominously behind them
i didnt say a word
parsons on the phone gestures for them to enter
into phone dorothy i cant discuss this now motions for them to sit im not taking it lightly no
we will talk about it at home
miranda and pete sit across from him
miranda trying hard to appear composed acutely aware of her every gesture and of how different her last visit to this office was
nothing casual about it now
she stares at the picture frames on phils desk all facing away from us the diplomas on the wall the books by noted fathers of neurology works by hughlings jackson
kurt goldstein henry head a
a framed quote reads if you do know that here is one hand well grant you all the rest
wittgenstein into phone yes dear
he hangs up
takes a moment to look at miranda
tries a smile but to her it comes off condescending
fact is theres nothing to smile about
im so sorry about this miranda
she nods dazed
angles her head to look at a framed picture on his desk
parsons looks to pete
has pete told you about the hearing
teddy already filled her in
teddy howard is top notch
hes going to do everything in his power and hes quite resourceful to prove youre not fit to stand trial
miranda i know you have no family left so were your family now and were all going down to the wire to protect you and help you in any way
push in on miranda who stares intently at something on the desk
not listening to a word hes saying who is that
parsons pauses here
exchanges glances with pete
the girl in the picture
we see what she is talking about a framed photograph on the desk is now facing us
it shows parsons his wife dorothy and a young girl
our teenage girl
miranda looks up at this perplexed
shes the girl i saw
youre obviously mistaken
she was hurt bleeding
is she all right
pete and parsons trade uneasy looks
miranda youve seen that photograph at least a dozen times every time youve been in this office
youre just confused not about this
is she all right
no shes not
beat rachel committed suicide six years ago
this shuts miranda right up
miranda thats none of your thats okay
to miranda rachel was a very troubled girl
handicapped since birth
she was born mute
my wife and i tried everything to help her fit in but
but she ran away from home more than once wanting to end her life
beat and she finally succeeded
jumped off ashley bridge
she was only seventeen years old
miranda hesitates here
she is not the type to believe in ghosts and knows full well what even her suggestion of it will sound like
im im terribly sorry phil
parsons doesnt want to talk about it anymore
peter can i speak to you
the men step outside
push in on mirandas face as she stares at the picture of rachel
we catch snippets of the doctors discussion outside increasing her paranoia textbook psychotic pattern
manifestation of guilt
much she knows about rachel
im telling you she doesnt
concocted alternate reality
im trusting you
crawling with cops
a dark shadow envelops mirandas confused face as we
mirandas pale skin is visible in the dim monochromatic light
we are moving towards her seeing her as if from the pov of someone approaching her
we become aware of the ragged breathing sound
miranda opens her eyes looks this way and that then closes them again
she is nearly asleep when she hears a sound weve heard before
the strained wet sound
mirandas eyes snap open
she slowly sits up back against the wall
squinting to cover every inch of the room
and now she sees it a shadow crouched in the corner
roughly the size of a person
miranda climbs off the bed and slowly walks towards it
scared but determined
she wrinkles her nose at the putrid smell coming from it
she gets closer
the ragged breathing growing louder as she reaches the shadow she stretches out her hand and finally touches
she swipes her hand through the air feeling stupid
this is not going to work
im sick of being watched and i know this place well and it doesnt smell this bad
she paces around the room feels the wall taps her head
im awake im not dreaming
im alive this is not some afterlife mumbo jumbo
so called paranormal activity can be debunked a million different ways
so whatever you are whatever it is im making up here im letting you go im setting you free
im the wrong person
and i need to sleep
im not afraid and i dont believe and im fully aware that this is all in my mind fiction a concocted alternate reality and i acknowledge it
and now im done with it
im going to sleep now
the moment is as brave as it is ridiculous
she has psyched herself into verbally defeating the ghost
and now she climbs back in bed
sleepy besides if you really were the ghost of rachel parsons you would let me out of this cell
and now we hear the sound of the deadbolt slide open
the door opens quietly
push into mirandas face
properly scared now
if proof is what she wanted proof is what she got
from now on well refer to the teenage girl as rachel
miranda takes a tentative step outside her cell feeling the door with her fingers feeling along the wall still making sure she isnt dreaming this
she looks down the long empty corridor the glare of neon lights making her readjust her eyes momentarily
but when she looks down the other way she sees a pair of bare feet disappear behind the wall
so quick were not sure we saw it for sure
miranda deliberately walks in the opposite direction
at night the clinical corridor takes on an unsettling quality
she silently strolls down the hall tilting her head at the various sounds from patients in their cells
she turns to make sure rachel isnt behind her and when miranda faces forward again she realizes she is standing right across from where two nurses are watching television
miranda tiptoes past them ducking at the window to remain unseen
this one is wider
miranda is startled by the sudden sound of laughter behind her
the nurses laughing at their late night show
momentarily distracted she almost knocks over a mop and bucket resting by the wall
she holds the mop in place and now opens the door to a
she looks for something a tool
discards a pair of brushes and finds a small screwdriver
miranda hurries up the stairs hugging the wall to stay clear from the surveillance camera sweeping the area
she waits at the landing times it just right and scurries to the next floor
knowing her way around here miranda keeps a steady pace as she heads towards her old office
she turns a corner and stops in her tracks another janitor making his rounds
she waits until hes out of sight and rushes to her office
she pulls out the stolen screwdriver and brings it to the lock
starts unscrewing the screws
she does this as fast as she can but shes no professional so it takes a few tries
she loosens one screw then another and clumsily drops the screwdriver
the metal echoes against the floor
miranda sucks her breath in waits
she bends down retrieves it and holds onto the knob for balance
it easily turns in her hand
it was open all along
she simply forgot to check
miranda shuts the door behind her and slips behind her computer
shrouded in darkness
hits a switch and a surveillance monitor comes to life
now she has a view of the corridors two guards here a nurse going for a smoke a janitor at the coffee machine and so on
she switches on her computer and taps her fingers as she waits for it to boot up
the janitor with his coffee cup now heading back towards mirandas office corridor
miranda glances at the door can see the glare of the computer screen reflecting against the glass pane
she tries opening drawers but theyre all locked
she remembers something and digs a sweatshirt from beneath the couch uses it to block the light
computer powered up she runs an online search for rachel parsons
waits as the info appears to self alright
what happened to you
various listings the archive news of her funeral something about her search and a local news article about teen suicide
thats the one she chooses
she checks the surveillance monitor again the janitor now mops right outside her door
the heading says what drives our teenagers to suicide
a quick glimpse gives us ages and names of three local girls who have died
rachels name and photograph appears with two others jenny dixon and andrea white
miranda pockets it looks back at the surveillance monitor the janitor is walking away
she watches him disappear down the hall
slowly but surely
and now the screen is empty
but just for a second
because suddenly rachel is there
staring straight at her
makes us jump
retracing her steps miranda shuts her door and hits the stairs
playing off the sweep of the surveillance camera
as she reaches the landing she hears voices coming her way
she detours down another corridor and hides from view
waits for consuelo and a nurse to exit down the staircase
and now she turns at another sound
coming from inside the room immediately behind her
she steps to the small glass pane on the door and peers inside
it takes a moment to adjust our eyes to the darkness but now we make out two figures in the room involved in some sort of struggle
miranda presses her face against the glass and now sees a flash of metal
not a knife but a needle
and now a blur of hair yanked up by a strong arm
in the dim light we can make out chloe eyes glazed drooling
just for a beat because now she is slapped down on the bed like a rag doll and the man with the needle enters miranda flinches confused
glances down the corridor to ensure she remains undiscovered
then peers back in
chloe on her stomach on the bed
her pale naked skin marked with scratches and bruises
the needle is stuck in her arm which hangs off the side
her mouth is open but it is impossible to tell whether she is laughing or sobbing
abruptly the man climbs on her pulling off his t shirt
as he discards it we see that it is yellow
disturbed miranda turns away
except now the corridor isnt empty
there is a janitor at the end
coffee cup in hand
staring at her disconcerted
miranda turns and runs
miranda bolts down the stairs
thundering footsteps and yells can be heard right behind her
miranda races down the empty floor towards an emergency exit door all the way at the end
two orderlies emerge from the staircase and give chase shouting for her to stop
patients holler from their cells awakened by the commotion
mirandas heart is nearly bursting through her chest as she gets closer and closer to the emergency door
twenty feet fifteen ten when a side door opens and a man in a yellow shirt appears blocking her path
miranda tries to avoid crashing into him but carries too much momentum
veers left against the wall but the man easily tackles her and pins her down
the orderlies and an nurse arrive at the scene to find her screaming hysterical
they hold her down its him
jesus christ its him
the man in the yellow shirt acts as if he has no idea what shes talking about
ho hum just another psychotic woman trying to escape
a nurse prepares a needle and we tracking along a long desk where the staff finish their morning meeting
parsons pete and irene among others
weve transferred her to a higher security room on the fifth floor
thats my final concession to any type of special treatment
and the night staff
they insist her room was properly locked what else could they say
could there be any truth to her claim
peter we have one hundred and forty employees
thirty five work maintenance
they all wear yellow shirts its their uniform
im holding a very discreet inquiry sure but i dont want a news van parked outside day and night
it makes much more sense that she tried to escape and got caught doesnt it
pete ponders this
it certainly seems that way
i perused mirandas files on chloe mcgrath theyre damn comprehensive
maybe she was a bit obsessed with her
irene and parsons share a look
he wraps it up the scariest gift god gave us is our minds
and a bright person like miranda shes grasping at straws here who knows what her brain is telling her now that its snapped
a better room in fact
this one has a view
heavy bars on the windows but still
pete is seated observing her deteriorating state
did you live here when rachel killed herself
as a matter of fact i was part of the search party that found the body
phil must have been a wreck
you can imagine
actually phil was in houston undergoing triple bypass surgery when it happened
what was that
miranda reacts to this
and this is confirmed
there are hospital records and so forth
im sure there are
can we get back on track now
miranda pulls out the folded printout from her pocket
what about these other dates was phil here when the other girls went missing and found dead
a disconcerted pete looks at the article with the pictures of rachel and the others andrea white and jenny dixon
where are you going with this
first im a suspect in dougs death now what phil parsons murdered his own daughter
rachel parsons disappeared six years ago
a week later shes a suicide
andrew white four years ago same m
and jenny dixon two years ago
dont you find that unusual
he regards her
maybe parsons is right shes desperately grasping at straws now
skims the article what same m
one jumped off a bridge one hung herself and one crashed her car
who gave you this
not one left a suicide note
in fact how is anybody sure these were suicides
you heard phil his daughter had tried several times before thats his story
i need to talk to the reporter who wrote that
well you cant
i beg to differ
i know my visitation rights
you cant because
miranda snaps to attention here
youre telling me the one local investigative reporter who connected three highly suspicious deaths just happens to have conveniently died
frank albright was an eighty year old retired sociology professor
re the article this is a fluff piece about teenage depression and the breakdown of the nuclear family
you can find one in any local paper anywhere any other week
dont be smug pete
thats one thing youve never been
rachel is somehow connected to what im going through
i dont know how like you said im not in a frame of mind to process the information without assistance
so im asking you for assistance
listen to me
you are not well
i had hoped once you remembered the murder we could deal with your feelings about it but these fixations
rachel parsons chloe mcgrath are self created distractions to avoid looking into yourself
and the longer you i know this lecture like the back of my hand
saves me the trouble
he raps on the door
triple locks come unlocked and an orderly is there
peter hurries down the corridor passing by a nurse
the same one who bandaged miranda earlier so lets give her a proper name claire
she pushes her cart into the elevator
claire and her cart emerge from the elevator and she heads down the long corridor reaches a door and unlocks it
tight on a row of drug filled shelves
claire parks her cart and kicks off her shoes
digs a pack of smokes out of her stashed purse when a pair of hands grab her
claire squeaks until she sees her attacker a stoner type named simon
deftly unbuttoning her uniform hands all over her
she means to resist but hes got such boyish charm
get off me you dog hell dont go all bubbly with joy or anything
you cant be in here and you know it
nap in your car
she finally twists herself out of his grasp
points an accusing finger but shes grinning
now get out before we get busted
properly reprimanded simon picks up his folded uniform and prepares to leave head hung low
you slay me claire
sure i do boy scout
she shakes her head slips her uniform back on
simon presses the button waits
he checks inside his folded uniform where we see several stolen vials of sedatives
the doors begin to close when hold it simon
he hides the loot behind his back busted
she holds the door open and tosses him his yellow shirt
what do you think i am laundry service
relieved wont happen again maam
she turns and exits
the doors slide shut
meet our rapist
bustling with activity
the room is divided into two a large main area where the patients eat plus a second smaller upstairs area for the staff
boom down to find miranda eating at a long table
shelley beside her playing with her plastic fork
jenna taps an unlit cigarette
as usual irene keeps watch nearby
shed get high on glue and make me help her try on my bras
is that the strangest shit youve heard
but shes a case
and she always put on a happy face
man what an optometrist
miranda starts to correct her but lets it go
you narced her out didnt you
bet you were a little buzzed yourself
mirandas gaze strays from this um most compelling of conversations and comes to rest on chloe
alone at another table
miranda rises and walks over
shelley waits until shes out of hearing range leans in to jenna all work that woman
work work work
what are you talking about
shes like an alcoholic
but with work
not safe to tell you
wish i could
jenna rolls her eyes returns to her food
parsons watches intrigued as miranda sits beside chloe and starts talking
from parsons pov up above we can see pretty much the entire dining area
trying to get chloes attention
but chloe just stares at her untouched food glassy eyed
i saw what happened
have you told anyone
look chloe the person who did this to you is not the devil
and if you can identify him ill make sure the motherfucker is arrested
now chloe looks at her like something finally registers
doctor did you just say motherfucker
do you know his name
maybe you saw a nametag on his uniform
chloe simply stares
finally shakes her head
man you must really hate me
i dont hate you
you hate me because now youre just the same as me
you must feel so embarrassed
i dont hate you
and i dont feel embarrassed
thats just a pat answer you have because youre new at this
trust me i know what im talking about
rising forget it alright
forget we had this conversation
chloe abruptly grabs her arm
you know what happens next
i get the distinct feeling youre going to tell me
the shock wears off and the guilt kicks in
and that guilt is the real motherfucker
youll be watched seven because theyre afraid youll kill yourself
graham will question every harmless gesture every innocent comment ever twitch you make and eventually and its a fucking tedious eventually youll stop hating yourself for what you did
but what replaces that hatred is this unbearable sadness
and you dont lose that as long as you live
push in on miranda
deeply affected by chloes words as we a miranda and the other patients line up for meds in the rec room
b irene keeps watch in the garden as the women get their daily fresh air
c wardens watch as each patient enters their cell at night and the lights go off
echoing an earlier scene we are moving towards her her pale skin visible in the dim monochromatic light
miranda flicks a look this way and that alert
leave me alone
just like a crazy person
she listens for any further noise hears none and shuts her eyes
ive lost my fucking mind
but now the bedsprings creak behind her and she whips around and starts to scream as a big hand covers her mouth
her eyes open wide at the sight of simon in his yellow shirt
he shoves her against the mattress and presses his full weight against her
she lets out a muffled scream as he uncaps a syringe with his teeth and brings the plunger to her throat
straight into her jugular
sotto this is gonna hurt you more than it hurts me
she flails and kicks desperately but he pins her down
the bedsprings strain violently and now hes straddling her squeezing the plunger into her throat
her eyes welling up sotto ive always wanted to do a doctor
she manages to free one hand and yanks the syringe from her throat
it flies to the floor
he grins enjoying this sotto the more you fight me the harder i get pussycat so pretty please with sugar on top keep still
simon paws at her clothes as she struggles to defend herself
he finally slaps her free arm down
presses his knee against it immobilizing her once more
now he produces another syringe from his pocket
miranda shakes her head pleading
a scream stuck in her throat
but nobody can hear her
simon brings the syringe towards her when suddenly we hear a loud clanging at the door
shaking it off its hinges
simon looks up confused
nobody is there
the split second distraction is all miranda needs to shove him off the bed
she fumbles for the discarded syringe and stabs his chest with it squeezes the plunger sotto take that son of a bitch
simon moans as the full dose hits his system and his body goes limp
miranda exhales coming back to herself
miranda grabs his keys begins to undress him
shows a uniformed janitor calmly walking down the corridor
pull back to see we are in a bank of monitors keep watch on the premises after dark
two guards play cards uno bored to tears
a cursory glance at the monitors produces no reaction
certainly a janitor walking down the corridor is no cause for alarm
crickets chirp or whatever it is crickets do
miranda steadies her breathing perusing rows of unfamiliar cars
she clicks simons key ring button repeatedly until a set of headlights blink on and off
miranda slips behind the wheel starts the car
the radio kicks in at ear deafening volume
she nearly drops dead
the gate guard reads a magazine as mirandas stolen car approaches
the guard barely registers the driver in the booth mirror immersed in his article
hits a button to open the gate for him
it opens slowly
s l o w l y
miranda sweating watches the receding image of the institute behind her
turns on the main road
thank you thank you thank you
she glances back makes sure no one is following her
catches her own reflection in the rearview mirror the scared eyes the haunted face
the new version of herself
she flips the radio dial bad new age muzak
more bad new age muzak
she finds iggy pops entirely appropriate the passenger and lets it play
now we are seeing her as if from the pov of someone traveling alongside the car
peering through the passenger window
miranda becomes aware of this slowly glances over
sees nothing but her own reflection
turns back forward
we notice the blue cigarette lighter key chain dangling off the dashboard
nothing but a long stretch of road ahead
the neighborhood perfectly quiet late at night
miranda parks in the driveway and stares at the empty house
steels herself climbs out of the car and heads around back
she finds her spare key behind a potted plant takes a deep breath and lets herself in through the back door
police crime scene tape everywhere
she turns on the kitchen light only and scurries to her bedroom without even looking in the direction of the living room avoiding the scene of the gruesome crime altogether
eerie as hell miranda stuffs clothes into a suitcase finds her passport digs out some cash from a box
quick change of clothes to get rid of the rapists uniform
fast fast fast
miranda watches her house fade from view in the rearview mirror as she drives down the block
flips the radio dial with shaky hands
weather forecasters predict heavy winds tonight as a major thunderstorm rolls in tomorrow
youre listening to klpg
on your dial
this next honky tonk heartbreak classic is
she looks in the rearview mirror once more
only this time she is met by a piercing pair of eyes
inside the car
rachels mouth opens unnaturally wide revealing a gaping abyss of rotted teeth and flesh and lets out the wet sound
a threatening howl this time pure venom
miranda covers her face jerks the car
it does a and slides to a halt in the middle of the street facing the direction of her house again
miranda jumps out panicked
looks inside the car no rachel
a beat to catch her breath making up her mind
slides behind the wheel and makes a u turn
miranda flips the rearview mirror so it faces the ceiling and turns up the radio
guns the pedal
shes driven maybe feet when suddenly her engine dies no
the car sputters to a stop
miranda goes to turn the key but suddenly freezes
looks at the ignition oddly and notices the key is gone
why are you doing this to me
a dead still beat
glancing around she is even more startled to see the blue lighter key chain lying in the middle of the street
miranda opens her car door and walks down the empty street to retrieve her suddenly magical keys
we watch her reach the keys all alone out here
the moment she bends down to pick it up she is blinded by the glare of headlight and the roar of an engine
miranda jumps out of the way narrowly avoiding being flattened by a road sweeper spraying water as it goes
she watches the truck disappear down the block
heart in her throat
calms her nerves and now walks over to the pesky keys again
smack in the middle of a puddle now
boom up the posts harnessing power lines which surround the area until we stop on a pair of industrial bolts fastened around the insulators of a thick power line
from here we see miranda bend down and pick up her keys
and now the bolts suddenly shake off their hinges coming loose right in front of our eyes moved by some invisible force miranda tilts her head at the sound of
a metallic snap and turns
the bolts pop out of their sockets
the live wire uncoils like some gigantic serpent and swings straight towards the paralyzed miranda she looks down at her feet ankle deep in the puddle back up at the
volts of power about to fry her to a crisp and jumps out of the way at the last second
the wire hits the water and the monumental charge sends sparks flying in every direction
it looks like lightning
a silent sudden beat
that was as close as close gets
fighting tears what do you want from me
no sign of rachel
miranda yells at the air glancing over her shoulder seemingly demented what is it you want me to do
the stolen car in the middle of the road
and now the squeak of a gate opening abruptly
miranda whips her head in the direction of the sound
its the front gate to her house
and now the front door swings open
and now the living room lights switch on
clearly rachel wants her back in the house
softly please please dont make me go back in there
but even as shes saying this her feet are moving towards it
she pauses looks at the car in the middle of the road
looks at the fizzling puddle where she was almost electrocuted
no neighbors have come out to investigate yet but how long can that last
she walks to the car
miranda climbs in not sure whether to laugh or cry here
shes never asked a ghost for permission before bear with me im just parking it out of the way so it wont look suspicious in the middle of the road
she starts the engine and pulls over to the sidewalk
miranda stands in her living room staring at her handiwork
frozen with dread
the blood has been cleaned up some but the mess remains
the upturned furniture covered in plastic the chalk outline of the body the yellow crime scene tape the shattered mirror above the fireplace the muddied footprints of dozens of cops
the faded writing on the wall not alone
miranda takes it all in not entirely sure what shes supposed to be looking for
piecing it together not alone
what happened to you happened to other girls
beat i understand
and im sorry
but there is nothing i can do about it now
it has nothing to do with me
not knowing what else to do she turns to exit when the television set suddenly comes to life making her jump
the unmistakable music from some old wb cartoon at full she stares at the tv screen
is there some sign here she should be able to follow
she crosses to turn it off and immediately doubles over in pain shit
she looks at her foot
a big shard of glass is stuck right through the flimsy hospital slipper into her skin
blood already seeping from the nasty cut miranda seated on the edge of the tub slowly pulls out the piece of glass drops it in the wastebasket
she grabs a cotton ball and alcohol and starts cleaning the cut
and now faint at first but growing louder she hears the hollow wet sound weve come to associate with rachel
inside the room with her miranda stares at the medicine cabinet
did the mirror move
we watch her from the mirror pov as she holds perfectly still listening
the sound now seems to have stopped
a silent beat
she turns her attention back to cleaning her cut grimacing as the alcohol burns her skin
it looks painful
and now the slow squeak of the medicine cabinet door makes her look up again
and she sees herself in the mirror like the night of the slaughter flames all around her
naked arms raised
the sound of flames growing no
miranda walks slowly to the mirror
incredibly the image reflecting back at her also grows bigger
as if the two versions of her are literally walking towards each other
from a side angle we see both their faces mere inches apart
miranda brings her fingertips to the mirror and touches it
immediately pulls her hand back
miranda stares at her fingertips
the tips are burnt
the skin sizzles softly
percent scientifically impossible
and when she looks up at the mirror again the image is gone
it is now deathly quiet
and what she finds herself staring at in the mirror is the reflection of something just behind her
a folded newspaper discarded in the far corner of the room
she turns to look at it now
its opened to the realty listings page
doug must have left it there
she picks it up and looks closer focusing on a picture of a bank repossessed property
the address is in willows creek
her brain wires start clicking
this must be what rachel wanted her to see
she stares at it
push in on the picture as we a for sale sign still flapping in the wind
the first few rays of light break through the dawn sky
mirandas simons car approaches up the road until it fills the frame and parks
miranda steps out
she studies the house before walking up the drive
we watch her peek through windows and walk around back looking for something
what exactly we dont know
neither does she
she makes her way back to the starting point and fixes her stare now on the barn
the one place he hasnt looked
the wind outside causes the aluminum siding to flap noisily
its slightly unnerving but hey its just the wind
miranda covers the distance of the large room perplexed
there is something about this place
something she cant quite put her finger on
with a last fruitless look she heads towards the front door when a glint of mental in the opposite corner stops her
she moves to it
and here where the walls should meet there is a narrow gap leading to a passage maybe five inches wide
a padlocked chain has been threaded through a hole in both walls holding them together
miranda inspects the heavy padlock the source of the glint
she tugs on the wall and opens it to the limits of the chain but thats only a few inches more
miranda peers into the darkness beyond but cant see a thing
hesitating only a moment she turns sideways and slides herself into the claustrophobic slot
she moves forward cautiously a few feet until her face brushes against something hanging in the air
she stops startled
its a pull string hanging from a naked light bulb
she tugs on it
and now she has watts of reddish glow to see the hatch on the floor immediately in front of her
she pulls on the latch and it opens with a rusty creak
she peers into the pitch black basement below
feels around for the beginning of a stepladder and climbs down
miranda emerges from the ladder into total darkness
whatever dim reddish light was provided by the bulb upstairs does not reach here
she feels around the wall for a switch
to self its not shrink appropriate to be afraid of the dark right
abruptly theres a sharp click as she lights simons key chain lighter and the wavery light illuminates the vast space
rats scurry for cover
it takes a second to orient ourselves
something metallic catches the lighters reflection way in back
miranda walks towards it
she takes a few more steps until her foot hits a bulk on the floor
kneels down and in the dim half light we make out a backpack
she unzips it and rifles through it t shirts underwear walkman until she finds a wallet
opens the billfold and brings the lighter next to the id the picture belongs to a teenager named
is there anybody here
the lighter in her hand is getting hot so she lets it click off
when it comes back on we see she has wrapped a ragged t shirt around it for insulation
miranda steps deeper into the room
up ahead she can make out the metallic thing that reflected light before
it is a hook in the ceiling
and suspended from it are several heavy chains
like a meat rack
and now she catches a whiff of the terrible smell and sees the body of the teenage girl hanging upside down tied around the hands and ankles
medical training kicking in miranda quickly lowers the girl to the ground causing the angry rats to skitter away
we see the following in between flicks of the lighter so that we go from midnight black to wavery light in an almost strobe light effect she checks for vital
signs pulse heartbeat mirandas adrenaline at full tilt cmon cmon cmon she strikes the flint and brings the lighter to the girls pupils
slaps her repeatedly clinically
the strobe effect also allows us glimpses of the immediate surroundings household tools strewn about wire cutters pliers a pool of dried blood
wake up tracy wake up nothing
she unties the wires around the girls ankles
the skin swollen grotesquely around them
she shakes the girl
slowly coming to the realization that its too late
miranda comes crashing out of the barn doubles over and throws up
the bright light outside blinding her momentarily
her bloodshot eyes taking a moment to register parked in front of the house
a police officer cautiously peering inside her stolen car
he looks up and notices her
nowhere to run
the officer waves
his name is turlington
he says this while already strolling over
mirandas mind races a mile a minute everything okay
that your vehicle maam
she stares at the young friendly cop
his left hand resting on his belt
right next to his gun
but it seems as if he has no idea who she is
at least not yet
yes i i just pulled over
i was looking for a bathroom
morning sickness you know
but im afraid this is private property you cant just waltz on in
you understand that
she nods nerves shot to hell
ill be on my merry way now
my husband will never forgive me if i get a ticket for trespassing
the cop nods at that seeming to have a fair grasp of marital dynamics
he flashes a smile but suddenly stops whips out his gun and trains it on her holy shit
clicks the safety off lady stay right where you are
miranda shuts her eyes busted
hands up where i can see them
miranda awkwardly raises her shaky hands
nice and slow start talking to me
and make it good
tell me just exactly who that is
a confused miranda slowly turns in the direction hes looking to see tracy seaver at the barn door
dragging herself in agony clearly in a severe state of shock
battered yet somehow incredibly still alive
but just barely
a car pulls up to the chaotic er area
phil parsons and pete step out rush inside
sheriff ryan is busy at the urinal
but even here he cant find any peace because teddy howard is on his case mr
howard let me simply list the events your client was involved in last night
first she drugs a janitor steals his car and escapes a mental institution hold on there isnt even any substantial evidence
sheriff ryan zips up his pants flushes and runs the sink to wash his hands mr
howard there isnt evidence because the overdosed janitor hasnt woken up thats why and when your client was questioned on the matter she admitted to injecting a full syringe of
handing him a paper towel you had no right to question my client without my presence mr
howard this is not a courtroom
your client was read her rights and she still insisted let me ask you this sheriff what exactly was a janitor doing with several vials of sedatives inside my clients
and is it not possible he had taken some drugs himself before my client sheriff ryan discards the paper towel and walks out to the waiting room teddy following closely
paramedics and nurses doing their thing
the young officer who arrested miranda hands the sheriff a cup of coffee
im not a drug expert
im simply stating the frigging facts
sheriff ryan burns his tongue on the coffee notices parsons and pete approaching
relief crosses his face
phil thank god this guys driving me nuts
an incident for lack of a better frigging word involving miss grey and a teenage girl whos been tortured and is in critical condition and chances are slim shell even
utter another word
whos the girl
a runaway from portland tracy marie seaver
reported missing a couple weeks ago
we found miss grey in some barn off willows creek with the girl all messed up
im just now waiting for the surgeon to give me an update
to teddy notice counselor how im not even mentioning her trespassing or lying to a police officer
teddy waves him off in frustration
goes to talk to turlington
christ the womans got the entire hospital busy sheriff ryan notices teddy talking to turlington why are you harassing my deputies
im only asking him where he got the coffee
hes not at liberty to answer that
youve had enough goddamn coffee already
the sheriff leaves pete and parsons
they walk over to the water cooler where they can talk more privately
we need to get miranda back to the institute
she needs psychiatric care not a prison cell
parsons nods lost in thought
sheriff ryan returns
phil how well does your wife know the suspect
why do you ask
because shes at the station right now demanding to speak with her
parsons frowns at this concerned
pete studies him
a desk and two chairs
glass window panes to insure no privacy
dorothy parsons s waits seated
the door opens and a deputy escorts miranda in
she sits across from dorothy looking as lost as can be
a long beat
how are you
miranda doesnt answer
her mind elsewhere
namely back at the barn and how it connects to rachel
i needed to see you but im not sure where to begin
i dont know you well i certainly have nothing but fond feelings for you
phil always keeps me posted on his colleagues and his work and in any case i have always thought of you as a very bright very perceptive doctor
even though i dont know you well
she pauses here
miranda looks up now
her face hollow and exhausted
bags under her eyes
a person who has seen too much
wondering where the hell this is going
my point is my point being when rachel died i had um i suffered through these spells these recurring dreams
and eventually once i came to terms with her death they went away
losing a child is the hardest most inconceivable event a mother can she drifts off
takes a beat to collect herself and resume the past few days i have been having the same dream
miranda cant help but smile to herself at that
welcome to my life
this nightmare involves rachel but it also involves you
in the nightmare rachel holds a box in her left hand
a small box
and she repeats a series of numbers
now rachel never spoke from the time she was born she had a condition i often asked god why he punished this child in such a way she couldnt speak
but she was extremely bright
she wasnt autistic as the doctors claimed dorothy parsons starts to cry
a moment passes like this
it seems she wont recover enough to continue her tale
parsons you need a therapist
normally i would encourage you to schedule a session with me but as you can see dorothy shakes her head determined to finish
she pulls out a folded piece of paper
every night the same box in her hand and the same numbers
i wrote them down
she slides the paper over
miranda watches her carefully then looks at the piece of paper
the numbers are
a long beat
its a message
its a code for something
i dont know what
but she wants you to have it
miranda studies it
studies this woman who quite frankly seems to have completely lost her mind
then she looks back at the numbers and is slowly hit with a realization
its my wedding date
she stares at dorothy stunned
brain click click clicking
her wildest fears confirmed doug is behind this somehow
that code belongs to a safety deposit box my husband kept in a bank up in newcastle thats where his parents live
beat dorothy i need you to drive up there and open it
dorothy stares at her scared
and finally nods
pete hurries down the front steps of the main building as two police cruisers pull up
miranda is brought out of one of the cruisers by two officers
we can take those off now
sheriff ryan leans out of the other cruiser
dont push it doctor
shes cuffed until your people secure her in a cell
pete sighs gestures for the officers to bring her in
irene and two heavy duty orderlies will also be part of the escort
miranda locks eyes with pete as she approaches
are you alright
quietly i was wrong
it wasnt phil parsons
it was doug
can we talk about this later
to sheriff thanks sheriff
tomorrow morning first thing my deputies are here
i know i know
well see you then
and my offer still stands if you need added security
she wont go anywhere
i guarantee it
the sheriff waves whatever
knocks twice on the hood and the officer behind the wheel shifts into drive
thats why rachel picked me
it was doug
im so stupid
pete regards her now has no idea what shes going on about this time
tries to remain professional
lunch time for the female wing
an excited shelley rushes over to a table where chloe and jenna are whispers something to them
they glance at the door
a moment later miranda walks in with her police escort
taking her across the cafeteria towards the back door
an uneasy pete leads
irene and the wardens at the rear
miranda glances at the women staring at her like a specimen
like somehow shes even more dangerous than them
top dog as it were of the crazies
and then halfway across the room one of the women stands up
she claps her hands together
miranda watches her confused
and slowly shelly jenna and others rise as well
all of them joining chloe in clapping
what is this
shes a hero
little red riding hood put the big bad wolf in a coma
just what he needed
the officers trade looks
theyre not gonna start something are they
irene shakes her head amused
you aint scared of a bunch of women now are you officer
the entire cafeteria is on their feet showing their solidarity for miranda
chloe locks eyes with her mouths the words thank you
and miranda is hauled out the side door
surveillance cameras in every corner
two separate doors with elaborate locks
high security all around
the officers undo mirandas cuffs and excuse themselves
pete gestures for irene and the orderlies to leave as well
well be right outside doctor
once the doors are locked and theyre alone the conversation jumps straight into frustrated high gear i pulled a lot of strings to get you transferred back
the best case scenario youre looking at right now is five years here
under my interrupting peter i didnt believe in ghosts before this
and neither do you
pete is at the end of his rope
cant hide his sadness when he looks at her
still he tries to get her back on track but you know that the brain is fully capable of tricking you into seeing all sorts of things
the simplest chemical deficiencies can chemical deficiencies cant get inside of you and make you do terrible things you dont remember doing
im a very open minded person but as a doctor no youre not
youre a close minded academic just like me
you told me once that i was the most logical person you knew remember
well everything thats happened has an explanation but it has nothing to do with psychiatry or science
rachel parsons was abducted and she was murdered six years ago tossed off the ashley bridge by my husband
my harmless righteous community leader husband thats how pathetically blind ive been
andrea white and jenny dixon were also abducted and murdered now this was before i met doug but i bet you anything that they both went to his school
then he obviously stopped for a while fear guilt distractions namely me delayed him from reverting to his sickness
thats why i didnt notice anything
i believe he really tried to lead a normal life for me
then along comes tracy seaver and he cant resist
locks her up and tortures her in some abandoned property she shows him the crumpled newspaper listing
heres dougs interest in real estate pete
pete stares at the realty listing for willows creek
rachel parsons is a pissed off ghost with an agenda furious at her parents for giving up on her shes been trying to communicate with them for years but theyre
too goddamn logical to pay attention and she picked me she sought me out that night and sent me home to fix her problem
made sure i killed doug because he was going to do the same thing to tracy seaver as he did to her
and she will get rid of anyone who stands in her way
pete takes all of this in
is that a threat
im telling you she nearly electrocuted me when i tried to leave town and she led me to that barn and if i dont do what she wants shes going
to kill me
pete can see that shes petrified
he starts to speak but she hushes him by gently placing her finger on his lips
the gesture is tender almost romantic
a reminder of their very real connection
i need you to at least consider the possibility that im not insane
beat pleading not as a doctor
as the only person i trust in this world
a tense phil and dorothy parsons in their parked car
im not doing it for miranda im doing this for rachel
youre making a complete fool of yourself
do you realize what you sound like
she sighs climbs out of the car leaving him there
takes three steps
turns back around and lets him have it what do i sound like phil
like one of your patients
well its probably because thats exactly how you treat me
and ive had enough of this deafening silence between us this exemplary mourning in front of the community tiptoeing around our lives with you pretending rachel never existed
bank customers walk around the argument pretending not to hear
phil is mortified
but dorothy doesnt care
im losing my mind
our daughter is gone and i miss her and im angry
she turns and storms off
phil takes it all in for the first time
a moment later he climbs out of the car
a solemn guard places the safety deposit box on the table in the middle of the room
steps back through the gate and waits
dorothy and phil stare at the box for a moment
finally phil punches in the code written out by his wife and opens it
he sorts through some paperwork that means nothing to him until his hands feel a thick envelope
he opens it and spills the contents on the table
it is a stack of polaroids
dorothy leans in and immediately her face darkens
she grabs onto the table shakily and is forced to sit down
a horrified sob rises from deep inside her comes out like the howl of a dying animal
her husband pales all blood draining from his face
the sky darkens fast
the storm moving in
thunder rumbles outside making a tray of meds rattle
pan up to see consuelo the round black woman we might remember chloe beating up earlier
she shakes her head
its gonna be an interesting night
miranda looks up at the sound of the bolt being drawn and the handle unfastened
through the door comes consuelo carrying a tray
sets it down by the bed
she is on her way out when she pauses stares at miranda
how are we doing today
that term again we
miranda doesnt have the energy for it just fine thank you
the spirit is not fine
shes very unhappy
what was that
normally miranda would look at this woman as if she were crazy but things have changed
how how do you know
shuts her eyes but shes only a girl
do you know her name
have you talked to her
yes i you could say that
consuelo holds mirandas hands firmly reading her
shes very very angry
and shes not finished with you yet
im sure thats meant to sound comforting but she wants to show you something
that may be so but i want her to go away
then you need to protect yourself
and how exactly would i do that
mira first im gonna bring you some cascarilla its a powder you get it anyplace it comes from eggs you pour it all over you indicates like this look reading
nametag consuelo i appreciate what youre trying to do but i honestly dont think this ghost will go away if i pour some egg powder on myself consuelo holds up a finger hushing miranda
shes receiving something here
she made you do things
bad things didnt she
and you carried this out for her
she used you as a vessel
consuelos grip tightens on miranda as we were back at the bridge
rachel pries open mirandas mouth
miranda panics what are you doing
im trying to help you
rachel opens her mouth wide like a snake
and as miranda screams blood starts leaking out of rachels wounds
and now we see it
rachels lips touch mirandas and breathe her spirit into miranda with a whoosh
consuelo lets go of mirandas hand
like recoiling from fire
speaks in the simplest of ways
the truth you were possessed by her
youre both in terrible danger
shes scared too but she cant step back into the light until she finishes what she started here
and now youre the only person who can help her find the way back
i dont know how to do that im not qualified for it
you do it
consuelo crosses herself
a sign of respect for the situation
but it has a chilling effect on miranda
despair is the only unforgivable sin
youll be in my prayers miranda
what good is that going to do
two police cruisers parked outside
a glassy eyed phil parsons serves himself another scotch devastated
the shot is framed so that we see the bedroom door is open dorothy lying in bed heavily tranquilized
sheriff ryan inspects the photographs
postcards from hell scared teenage girls in forced poses gagged tortured andrea white jenny dixon tracy seaver
and young rachel parsons
this proves that her story is true my daughter appeared to her in some form and guided her through all this putting things right
come on phil you of all people i of all people hold logic reason and facts above everything else
and seek the truth through proof and proof only
re pictures and what do you call that
has it occurred to you that maybe she knew what her husband was doing to those girls
frankly it hasnt
maybe she couldnt stand the guilt and cooked up this far fetched tale to tug at everybodys heartstrings
the fact remains she hacked her husband to pieces
the fact remains my daughter was murdered and miranda stopped the killer
a killer who was loose under your incompetent nose for over six years
we dont know how many future victims were spared but we do know she saved that girl in the barns life
and thats more than you or i can say
for the record that girl is on a ventilator
the doctors dont think shell make it through tonight
now you want to stand up in a courtroom and tell a judge that a ghost is behind all this thats your prerogative but i have to abide by the
and the law says miranda grey faces criminal chargers
so heres what were going to do
im going to leave a cruiser outside to make sure you dont go anywhere tonight and two of my deputies will go guard ms
grey until tomorrow morning
parsons doesnt respond
his eyes far away
there will be no breakouts no aiding and abetting no taking the law into your own hands
itll take an act of god for miranda grey not to show up in that courtroom tomorrow
are we clear
and now the sheriff can see that parsons is crying
and its a disparaging sight
sheriff ryan exits
two deputies follow radios parsons remains still for a moment then digs a photograph out of a drawer
a picture of rachel in happier times
i will never forgive myself for what happened to you
not as long as i live
breaking down i miss you so much
he sits there staring at his dead daughter
we pull back to see he is not alone
rachel is watching him
the wind has really picked up now
a massive lightning bolt streaks the sky officially announcing the storms onset
a police cruiser pulls up to the guard gate
pan off the bank of monitors to the same two guards weve seen before
playing yet another bored card game
the light rapping on their glass door makes them look up
two officers stand there
we recognize one of them were here on miranda grey detail
the guards shake their heads chuckle
you can get a couple chairs from the nurses up there
a pretty decent cup of joe too
the guard points at the bank of monitors
although why the sheriff is making you fellas waste your time is beside me
we got her right here
she aint going no place
miranda inside her pristine white cell
looks perfectly harmless doesnt she
dont they all officer dont they all
the men share a chuckle over that one when suddenly thunder crackles and the power goes out
no monitors no radio no nothing
there goes the card game
abruptly theres a series of sharp clicks as four flashlights come alive
the thunder outside rattles the window pane
the only light source being the intermittent lightning as the she paces in the dark
the two cops use their flashlights to hustle up the stairs
miranda holds her breath listens
and sure enough somebody else is in the room
she looks around
what do you want
and now lightning streaks the room and we see rachel in the corner
staring with her dead eyes
moving towards her
ive done everything youve asked me to
my life is ruined
i cant take this anymore
faintly you have to step into the light rachel
you dont belong here you dont belong
but it doesnt work
rachel keeps walking towards her
miranda backs up against the wall
fighting tears into the light loudly can somebody come in here
i need help
the cops reach the landing where we see other flashlights down the corridor
they walk towards them
and who are you
officer turlington maam
were supposed to sit outside miranda greys cell all night
knock yourself out
next floor up
loudly its only a power outage ladies lets call it an early night
the cops head down the corridor
rachel stretches out her arm to mirandas face please dont
why are you doing this
over and done
rachel slowly shakes her head places her hands on mirandas eyes and shuts them in her school uniform
staring straight ahead
now the image is bathed in a red and blue light and we see her half naked bruised
staring at us in her school uniform
now abruptly she is a hellish vision opening her mouth in agony also bathed in the strange red and blue light miranda screams at the visions
rachel holds her steady
i dont want to see this
i cant help you anymore
now a heavy rattling makes her turn to the door
one of the hinges has shattered and the latch itself is half pulled from the doorframe
relentless pounding on the other side
let me out of here
let me out
theres a deafening sound like a thousand bells ringing at once and miranda covers her ears outside we hear murmurs yells instructions the cops arrive to find every door in
the corridor flung open
confused patients spill out as guards and nurses try to restore order
radios squawk flashlights beam and footsteps fill the dark corridor as patients try to escape
fire engines and patrol cars arrive at the scene sirens blazing
sheriff ryan and additional deputies rush from their cars to contain the breakout
a large spotlight comes to life
we spot jenna making a run for the garden wall when the spotlight hits her
two officers rush after her
sheriff ryan makes his way through the mayhem past irene helping a patient past nurse claire cowering in a corner christ almighty
sheriff ryan hits the stairs
officer turlington runs down the corridor searching frantically with his flashlight a car pulls up at the scene
pete and parsons step out
pete rushes up the steps officer turlington looks inside mirandas cell
and as he is about to speak into his walkie he spots her seated by the elevator
holding a biting block in shelleys mouth as her seizing subsides
into radio sheriff
i have miss grey right here
he flashes his light at her
miranda looks back blankly
sorry we thought you might have made a run for it
page irene asap
this patient needs her meds
miranda looks down at a grateful shelley whose head is cradled in her lap
brushes the matted hair off her face
carefully removes the biting block making sure shelley is alright
after a beat youre gonna get that pulitzer after all
shh shh just rest
sotto smiling i told you i could keep a secret
the patients are all assembled here
irene and consuelo do head counts
guards officers janitors everybody
irene points a finger at jenna
you have really disappointed me tonight jenna give me a break
you wouldnt respect me if i hadnt tried parsons breaks away from turlington heads over to pete and miranda everybody accounted for
were doing the final count
now they cant find the sheriff
miranda scans the near dark room looking for someone
watches turlington step aside to take a call on his radio
parsons regards her with newfound respect are you alright miranda
thanks for asking
suddenly all the policemen in the room begin to exit whats going on officer
one of your patients is holding the sheriff at gunpoint
shes in the cafeteria
pete glances at miranda
she knows exactly who it is chloe
turlington is about to exit when parsons stops him i think doctor grey should be the one to talk to her
the door crashes open and chloe shoves the sheriff inside
she has a gun pressed hard against his ear
young lady i dont know how you think you can get out of here but youre very polite for a piggy
now take off your uniform
sheriff ryan hesitates
chloe presses the gun against him
do it quick
i wont make fun of you
the sound of the upstairs door being thrown open makes her glance up
she trains her flashlight at the second level stepping behind the sheriff to use him as cover
nobody better fucking move up there or ill blow this piggys head off
her flashlight beam searches the section
catches the reflection of a police shield hiding behind a table
that means you fucko
up on your feet or ill start by shooting his ear off
officer turlington rises
slow and deliberate
to sheriff sotto tell junior the grownups are talking now and hes not allowed in here
turlington its alright
i can im just going to the grownups are talking
dont paraphrase me
the grownups are are talking now
a voice startles chloe from behind at floor level
can i talk to you
chloe flicks the flashlight to see miranda by the door
dreadful timing im real busy
you have to let him go
chloe flinches at that
like all this multitasking is affecting her
she digs the gun deeper into the sheriffs neck making him cower to his knees execution style look lets not confuse things
i like you
but this is my only chance
to sheriff now take off that goddamn uniform before i get really pissed
the sheriff glances at miranda
the sheriff begins unbuttoning his shirt what are you going to do
put on his uniform and walk out of here
think about it chloe
they know you have him
the place is crawling with cops
what are my options
to grow old in this place
its clear they will never let me go
thats not true
you have less than a year left here
thats a lie
ill never stop being sick theyll just find something new thats wrong with me
no wonder you doctors cant help anyone all you have are deficit columns and stupid tests designed to point out what part of the puzzle you think were missing
she starts sobbing
letting everything go youre right doctors never concentrate on the things patients are actually capable of
but i know you chloe youve been through things that most people dont survive
and you have a wonderful future in front of you if you choose it
its up to you
this gets through to chloe
her grip loosens on the gun
no more guilt no more hatred no more unbearable sadness
you have no use for any of that anymore
your life begins this very second
im so tired
so goddamn tired miranda walks over and embraces her
chloe hands her the gun
and thats when the power returns
miranda and chloe frozen in their embrace
sheriff ryan on his knees
in the sudden shocking glare of returning light color abruptly re enters the world and every radio phone fan and machine that were left on hum to miranda finds herself
staring at sheriff ryan bathed in the glow of the flashing red and blue lights from the cruisers outside
the image a replica of the andrea white and jenny dixon visions
peeking from his half unbuttoned shirt is the beginning of a chest tattoo
miranda slowly trains the gun on the sheriff finally struck with the realization it was you wasnt it
what are you talking about
she opens his shirt to reveal the tattoo a s pinup style woman surrounded by flames arms raised shackled
mirandas recurring vision from the night of the slaughter
thats what rachel has been trying to tell me all along
doug was not alone
you were with him
this whole time its been you
you covered up their deaths to look like suicides
the sheriff throws his jacket on starts walking youve lost your mind
dont fucking move
of a safety being released makes him pause
he turns to look at her
a tense beat
miranda dont do it
she glances at petes pleading face and the room around her cops everywhere
all guns trained on her
sheriff ryan speaks low so only she can hear the following and just exactly who would believe you
no proof no living witness
everybody knows youre crazy
mirandas finger itches on the trigger as they face off
her hand starts to shake
sheriff ryan turns and strides off
but as much as she wants to she cant bring herself to do it
finally brings the gun down
the armed policemen rush over and disarm her shove her to the floor and cuff her
i want that woman in custody
she has a judge to face in the morning
turlington escorts a cuffed miranda to a waiting cruiser
he jumps behind the wheel and starts to pull out when pete suddenly taps on mirandas window startling her
ill call your lawyer and
sir not now ill meet you at the station
she shakes her head
mouths something pete cant make out
sir please what
turlington hits the gas
miranda presses her face against the window so only pete can see her say the following the girl in the hospital
pete locks eyes with her nods as the cruiser leaves
tracy seaver lies unconscious hooked up to a series of machines
pull back to find pete with a young doctor
her condition remains the same
basically that ventilator is keeping her alive
we have no reason to think shell ever wake up
pete nods disconcerted
stares at the girl
you mind if i stay here tonight
hey its a big place
the more the merrier
if i can just ask you to wait outside
the doctor gestures for pete to make himself comfortable
brooks to er
brooks thats me
the doctor rushes off
like tracy seaver simon reynolds is hooked up to a bunch of machines and cables
suddenly his eyes shoot open and the cardiac alarm squeals two nurses rush in
the young doctor right behind
the ekg whipsaws
the doctor feels for a pulse then slaps on the defibrillator pads places the paddles on the chest clear
he begins chest compressions on simons heart
he spasms violently once twice and then it stops
the doctor and nurses stare at the monitor
unseen by them rachel steps out of the room
we see turlington and two other cops climb in a patrol car and drive off
we move inside the empty station
sheriff ryan takes a healthy chug from a fifth of scotch slips it back in a drawer
stares at his hands
steady as a rock
takes a deep breath
knows what he must do next
a religious man despite everything he brings his thumb to his forehead and crosses himself
mirandas eyes snap open at the sound of deadbolts sliding unlocked
could this be rachel
a looming figure appears at the door
doesnt bother to shut it
stares at her silently for a long while
and so begins a claustrophobic cat and mouse game how did you know
you tell me
this isnt one of your word association games doctor
did douglas tell you that night
why wait this long if he had
maybe its your amnesia
maybe you blocked it out
but it seems to me that its vital you know for sure
he studies her
takes a step towards her
miranda responds by stepping back
a slow motion semicircle if you will
she eyes the open door
you think me and doug are monsters
that this was all a carefully laid out plan with those girls
but it wasnt that at all
you do things sometimes and youre not sure why you did them
then you realize you can live with them and so can everyone else
life goes on
if youre looking for forgiveness you came to the wrong place
shes stalling trying to keep him talking and he knows it
one thing about fear is it makes people say the dumbest things
be that as it may youre afraid too because you know killing me wont solve your problems
my only problem is you
what about parsons
and that girl in the hospital will never forget your face
you miscalculated now you pay
patience tested he suddenly whacks her across the face
i hate a bad bluffer
she makes a big effort to hide how much that stung
i sure hope that felt good because you cant afford too many more signs of struggle
go ahead hit me back
its what you want
no thats what you want me to do
back to profiling huh
your thought process is completely transparent
and now miranda briefly takes the reins of the conversation
analyst and patient in session
echoing her opening scene with chloe
so were even
you left that door open so id try and run its what you get off on isnt it
i guess well find out
and yet you have to make me look like a suicide
with what your belt
off his shrug how would i get access to a belt
trust me prisoners hang themselves with just about anything
i dont think thats going to satisfy you
you wont be able to do this clean
you have too much guilt inside
another slap across the face
mirandas knees buckle
but she remains standing
her lip trembles
youre losing grasp of the situation
it was different with those girls
i bet all they did was cry and scream
dont worry youll scream
after a beat take off your shirt
this throws her off
she shoots a quick glance at the door
arent i a little old for you
take it off
he draws his gun tired
removes the safety
thats for show
you know you cant shoot me
but i can smash your teeth out and make it look like you bashed your head against the wall
now shut up take off your goddamn shirt and pull off your bra
miranda is petrified now
running out of ways to hide it
in a sudden move miranda shoves the chair at him and bolts out the door
the sheriff doesnt move to stop her
miranda dashes down the hallway trying to escape
takes quick inventory of the space two more holding cells like her own a row of filing cabinets and a storage area with barred windows
she makes a turn up ahead and reaches another gate down the corridor
a sliding gate that closes off the cell area from the main station
she tries the gate
she shakes and bangs on it desperate
and no way to disguise the sheer panic in her voice
she fell for his trap
theyre all alone here
ryan smiles at that
re holsters his weapon and walks towards her taking his time
relishing the hunt
doug mentioned you were painfully modest
but enough about you lets discuss rachel
now miranda searches for a place to hide
his footsteps she was no crippled saint
wasnt the first time she turned up at dougs house all messed up
sheriff ryan peeks down the corridor where we last saw miranda
the gate still locked
shes not there
he traces her steps clearly enjoying this sure she was a minor but she wasnt going to let that get in her way
miranda is cramped underneath an upturned desk
the shot is framed so we can see the doorway
she prays silently sotto rachel where are you when i need you
clearly not here
sheriff ryans voice getting closer those other girls make no mistake they knew what they were getting into
he appears at the doorway now peeks inside the room
sensing her in there
miranda holds her breath
im not saying they knew they were going to die but truth is doug and i didnt know it was going to end that way
it was just the natural extension of that moment
so yeah we fucked them and we killed them
and we knew it was wrong
sure we did
he reaches the upturned desk and flips it over with a clanging sound
miranda wasnt underneath that one
she scrambles to the door behind him as he turns she slams the door shut on his fingers and fumbles to slide the deadbolt behind her when the door suddenly
smashes open against her knocking her backwards onto the floor he looms over her
she reaches around for anything to defend herself
it wasnt some satanic pact society didnt make us do it
but i believe given the proper circumstances a person is capable of anything certainly in my line of work you see it day in day out
beat tell you what keep the shirt
the bra will do
miranda stares helpless
the sheriff gestures for her to begin
like he has all the time in the world
miranda slides up the wall and starts to unclasp her bra under her shirt
petrified chin up doctor
you wanted to get to the bottom of this and you did
you followed it all the way through
this is how it ends
his demeanor and voice are eerily calm as if in a trance
he takes the bra from her hand and hangs it around her neck as if helping somebody with their tie
she takes a step back and finds herself pinned against the wall doug settled down once you two got married
new start and all that
wanted nothing to do with this runaway id found tracy seaver he squeezes the bra tightly around her throat choking her
she stares straight into his eyes her whole body simultaneously frozen in place and shaking uncontrollably or so he claimed
because the truth doc is people never change
the son of a bitch couldnt resist
i asked him to dump the body and instead he went found some barn to work her out of his system some more
go fucking figure
and now we pan down to see mirandas left hand ever so slowly reach for his holster
you cant count on anyone even friends youve had your whole life
theyre so close together their noses nearly touch
he gazes into her eyes watching life drain out of her
he applies one final burst of pressure stretching her skin to the point of no return the only soul you can ever count on is yourself blam
a gunshot rings out and half his ear explodes in a gush of blood
he stumbles back still on his feet dazed
he looks up at miranda with the gun trained on him
struggling to catch her breath
a faint smile forms on his lips somehow appreciative of this turn of events
that was unexpected
he steps forward almost playfully
she slowly shakes her head
wraps her fingers tightly around the trigger you sure about this
he stares at her
blood flowing from the side of his head
hes now standing directly in front of mirandas open cell weighing his options at triple speed you need me alive for your story to stick
be logical now
you know you cant kill me
he takes exactly half a step forward when miranda drills a bullet through his forehead
sheriff ryan splays backwards and lands with a crash
logic is overrated
the door to tracys room is closed
we find pete where we left him by the soda machine fighting to stay awake
moving toward him we come to rest on the back of his neck
so tight we can actually see the hairs on the back of his neck
and as he feels the swoosh of a cold whisper they stand up on their ends
pete turns to tracys room to notice that the door is now open
he stands up and walks to the door
pete looks oddly around the room
anybody in here
as he turns we reveal rachel slipping out of the room
unseen by him of course
pete starts to exit when tracy opens her eyes
groggily waking as if from a dream
turlington comes out of his cruiser carrying a bag of take out food
chatting with his colleagues
turlington raps on the sheriffs door and opens it
no sight of the man
maybe hes in the bathroom
turlington heads in that direction
turlington peeks in
checks the stalls
he notices the back window is open because raindrops are blown in by the wind
he looks out to the parking lot for a moment before shutting it
the front desk officer is trying to hold back a grim pete parsons and teddy howard from heading to the back area
im sorry but nobody is allowed to visit at this hour is the sheriff here or isnt he
reaching the scene help you gentlemen
were here to see miranda grey
you know full well youre not allowed to see teddy howard slaps an official looking document on him
thats straight from judge wilkinson
take us to her cell
better get the sheriff out here
turlington looks over the paperwork confused
sheriff ryan isnt here
his car is gone too
officer unlock the goddamn door to mirandas cell or ill break it down myself
turlington is not used to being spoken to this way certainly not by upstanding directors of psychiatric institutes
he leads the men down the corridor and unlocks the cell
the men wait as all three locks are dutifully undone and then the heavy door is slid open
the men look inside and instantly stop in their tracks
sheriff ryan splayed
teddy howard has to look away
pete places his hand on parsons shoulder
parsons simply glares at the dead man eyes filled with hatred
no sign of miranda anywhere
camera soars through the tall gates past the guard past the sprinklers watering the impressive gardens
a taxicab pulls up
a healthier much happier looking chloe shakes petes hand at the front steps
small suitcase by her side
thank you for everything dr
ill never forget all youve done for me
its been my pleasure miss mcgrath
good luck out there
her first day out in the real world
well i guess this is it
i hope not to see you again unless its for coffee or something
hey you never know
its a small world unless you have to clean it
chloe picks up her bag climbs down the steps to her cab
stops midway turns you dont have to tell me if you dont want to but have you ever heard anything from
pete shakes his head
chloe nods climbs inside the cab
pete waves as it drives off
then he pulls out a postcard from his pocket
it has a new york city postmark
hope this finds you on both feet preferably having been promoted to director after phils retirement
not that you had much competition but a big hug to you anyway
i was as surprised as anyone to read about sheriff ryans suicide and the startling discovery that it was he who murdered my late husband
i wish i could personally thank certain people for their convincing testimonies in the case
fly at us under her v
a female doctor still at large wanted for questioning with a picture of miranda underneath
b guilt ridden serial killer killed accomplice then killed self female doctor cleared on charges
pictures of sheriff ryan and douglas grey side by side
c authorities close case on dual serial killers community mourns murdered daughters
a picture of officer turlington pete and phil parsons at a press conference
as for myself i have a new name now and a job working with teenage girls at a runaway shelter trying to keep an open mind at the horrors they
boom down to a young woman kneeling down to set flowers on a grave and we recognize her as tracy seaver
shockingly cleaned up and properly attired shes even cute
which reminds me consuelo the cuban witch is a keeper dont fire her
she knows things about the world you and i dont
pull back to see the gave is rachels and it is positively overflowing with flowers
shes become something of a cause celeb in these parts
tracy walks back to the retired couple holding hands phil and dorothy parsons
well gotta run now i have some country songs to write and lots of social invites to decline
still pulling back through the lush cemetery past several trees until we find rachel watching the serene scene
she turns to camera now and we push into her eyes finally at peace until it fills the screen and in it we see
miranda walking among the throng of pedestrians
she looks confident relaxed down to earth
no longer the tightly wound professional at the beginning of our story
and in case youre wondering what the chances are of me buying you a beer and maybe finishing something we almost started the answer is its just not going to
especially not at mcsorleys next friday night
say around nine
so you probably shouldnt bother showing up
all my love m
she turns at the light and gets lost in the crowd
