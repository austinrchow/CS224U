over darkness a womans voice speaks to us
italo calvino once said that myth is the hidden part of every story the buried part the region that is still unexplored because there are as yet no words to
enable us to get there
beat but i was there for the end
i took part in it
and i think my words can help shed light on what happened
my name is abigail
this is our story
harsh sunlight beats down over a bleak unforgiving stretch of rocky desert
amidst this desolation rise the ruins of an ancient sumerian ziggurat a massive stepped pyramid of mud brick that was once the center of the city known as ur
kneels by the ziggurat tending to a ragged band of sheep
he is conducting the first of his daily prayers listening to a religious broadcast from baghdad on a tinny radio
presently we hear helicopters
the sheepherder looks up approach from the east
they touch down near the base of the ziggurat rotors stirring up clouds of dust
disembark their bodies covered in desert camo gear
they wear helmets with polarized face plates and are armed to the teeth
to the sheepherder they might as well be aliens
one of the figures turns to the east
we can see the rising sun reflected in the face plate of his helmet and a hint of a skull like under mask respirator beneath the face plate
he raises a gloved hand gives the finger to the new day
another figure a woman waves a hand urging them onward
they mount the central steps of the ziggurat
the shrine is empty
the woman activates a wearable computing device calling up a schematic of the ziggurat
she kneels studying the floor
in the corner of the room she identifies a particular brick and presses it
we hear hidden counter weights shifting and the floor opens up revealing a stone stairway leading down
the figures descend into an empty room with an earthen floor
the sunlight from above barely penetrates down here
one of the figures takes out a battery powered lantern turning it on illuminating walls covered with cuneiform writing
the male figure who flipped off the sun speaks via radio headset
weve got dick
turning to the others is there any reason we had to embark on this cluster fuck during the day
the woman removes her helmet
this is danica talos
intense appearing to be in her s
possessing a regal air
she wears a silver crucifix around her neck
night times too tricky grimwood
you know that
one by one the others remove their helmets
all vampires grimwood s a hulking vampire with an imposing physique and an even more imposing set of surgical steel teeth fangs
asher os a natural born leader with easygoing charisma
wolfe s quiet and deliberative
right now hes readying a portable ground penetrating radar unit
grimwood studies the writing on the walls
what is this chicken scratch
dates back about four thousand years
so why here
because this was the cradle of civilization
he wouldve been comfortable here
i dont know dan
seems like another dead end
im not so sure wolfe looks at his unit excited
the others gather round
theres something beneath us
we see a cross section image of the soil and subsurface features beneath them
something has been buried down there
is that a body
wolfe makes a few adjustments on the unit
the image resolves further
its definitely a body
then we hear the low rumbling of more hidden counter weights and slides down from above the stairs sealing off the vault
what the fuck
grimwood pounds his fist against the stone
he tries to find a hand hold tries to shoulder it open in some way but the barrier is unmovable
radio back up
see if they can open it from the other guys
wolfe points at the ground
a tiny depression has formed with sand funneling into it
wolfe sets his radar unit down and kneels before the hole
the grains of sand are falling faster now the depression gradually widening
curious wolfe leans closer suddenly explodes upward from the ground
it latches onto wolfes neck
dragging him down head first
wolfe thrashes his head still buried beneath the sand
he knocks over the lantern which flickers shorting out
asher rushes to wolfes side
they grab wolfe by the shoulders screaming trying to pull him back
asher is kicked by wolfes thrashing legs
he flies upward hits the ceiling falls back onto the ground stunned danica joins grimwood
abruptly they wrest wolfe free headless
blood erupts from the sand
then unearths itself roaring
its difficult to make out in the flickering light
but what we do see is terrifying
spiked demonic armor clutching a sword
an elongated helmeted face with a blood splattered set of hinged fangs hinting at an inhuman physiognomy within
the hinged jaws open coming at us
and just as the lantern goes out for good we danica moves down a modern architectural corridor lined in glass and steel
vampire soldiers stand ready nearby outfitted in body armor clutching automatic rifles
asher grirnwood and another vampire hendrix are gathered by a titanium door outfitted with a biometric security system
danica joins them studying a video monitor which offers a darkened view of the interior of the vault
we can just make out a figure sitting there in the shadows
whats he been doing
just sitting there since we brought him here
nervously do you think weve got enough security
hendrix if he wanted to out of there there isnt an army in the world that could keep us safe
we didnt capture him
he allowed us to take him in
nodding to the door now open up
the others look at her like shes insane
nevertheless danica places her hand on the biometric scanner
hendrix keys in a series of commands on a nearby computer console
the vault doors open with a hum allowing danica into she steps inside
the vault closes behind her
we hear blowers as the air is cycled
a second set of doors open danica steps into a nearly pitch black clean room
we hear breathing
despite her calm demeanor shes frightened
from the darkness someone speaks a voice low and rumbling laced with an ominous gravity
why have you woken me
your people need you sire
she kneels bowing her head
mocking my people
you think im your messiah
we hear movement
a pair of red eyes pierce the gloom and god help us even though he remains partially shadowed this guy has to be the scariest mother fucker weve ever seen
what makes you think i wanted to be brought back
a hand emerges from the darkness armored
danica wants to bolt
instead she fights to keep herself from flinching as a taloned finger brushes her throat
times have changed
science has made great strides
your blood the sacrament you provide it can set us free now
and the one i killed earlier
he was vampire
off her nod you must forgive me
it had been centuries since i last fed
then offer yourself to me child lifting her chin and let me quench my thirst again
the vault doors open and danica stumbles out all but falling into ashers arms
shes bone white and there are fresh bite marks on her throat blood staining her shirt
are you alright
she nods shaking struggling to recompose herself
let him out he wants to see whats become of his world
larry king launching into the intro of his show
edgar vance forensic psychiatrist and author of the new york times best seller human health the whole being breakthrough
also with us is martin vreede chief of police
theyre here for an hour and theyll take your calls
next on larry king live
taping is underway
larry king sits at his desk opposite edgar vance s a smooth talking pundit with a magnetic demeanor and movie star good looks
chief martin vreede s square jawed joins via remote feed
vance youre a psychiatrist and a biochemist isnt that right
ive long believed that in order to achieve true health we have to reconcile the body and the mind
of course that also requires letting go of a lot of our old notions and superstitions which is what my work is all about
lets talk about that
how do you account for the fascination with things that go bump in the night
movies books videogames seems like we cant get enough of our boogeymen
vance leans forward skillfully playing to the cameras
monsters provide a means for us to transfer our more primal and darker urges into something external
in the case of vampires youre dealing with taboo issues like predatory rage and sexual sadism
these are scary subjects for people to own up to
so we pass the buck to someone else
historically people suffering from medical conditions have always been our psychological scapegoats
in the middle ages schizophrenia was often attributed to demonic possession
well theres a hereditary blood disease known as porphyria that has symptoms remarkably similar to the classic vampiric traits
people suffering from this disease are anemic they become sensitive to sunlight they cant tolerate garlic which is too bad since my doctor tells me thats good for the heart
turning to chief vreede chief vreede
whats your take on all the recent rumors weve been hearing about vampires
the only vampires im worried about are the ones passing the bar exam
laughing seriously if vampires existed dont you think wed be on to them by now
the truth is our streets have never been safer
homicides assaults violent crime is down across the board
if people want to be concerned they should focus on criminals like blade
now whos this
tell me about him
hes a sociopath weve been pursuing
blade is a very disturbed individual
even the name hes chosen for himself is troubling
according to witnesses he operates under the belief that a vast conspiracy of vampires live amongst us
you have to look at the psychiatric underpinnings here
what does a person like blade really want
odds are hes really trying to work out some kind of inner trauma
he thinks hes slaying monsters but hes really trying to murder aspects of himself
the sound of gunfire pre laps over from the next scene as we a massive explosion ripping through an industrial building
banks of windows blow outwards fire rolls brick walls crumble raining debris everywhere
goes tumbling into the night air
buoyed by the explosion his body flies upward trailing fire like a human comet
more men vampires race out some of them on fire
as a formidable figure resolves out of the swirling flames
its blade striding towards us in slow motion body bristling with weapons the exaggerated sounds of his footfalls ringing out like drums of doom
he looks like the god of war
we ramp back up to real time
then faster as a trio of vampire low lifes stone gedge and campbell run for their lives towards their vehicles
two modified street racing cars are pulling out a mustang and an eagle talon
gedge is climbing into the talon even as it starts to move pulling the door shut
at the same time stone and campbell climb atop two stretched and lowered hardtail chopper cycles
blade starts forward drawing two of his custom mach pistols but the mustang comes screaming in reverse towards him
blade makes a super human leap over the speeding car
momentarily upside down he fires through the windshield and engine block as he flips
within the car the vampires ash
the mustang explodes
flipping over and blade now facing frontward again continues to fire as he lands aiming at which haul ass out of the parking lot swerving into the traffic on the
blade keeps firing until hes out of bullets
then no more bullets blade
guess its time for you to fall down and go boom
from the conflagration their clothes still smoking surround blade
call them emond doh denlinger and ellingson
blade holsters his mach pistols
then reaches for a wicked looking chain knife strapped to his thigh
the knife has a button on either side of the hilt
as ellingson rushes him blade triggers the first button
the knife blade ejects from the hilt trailing outward six feet on a razored chain
the blade penetrates ellingsons chest
he gasps as he starts to ash
but before his disintegration is complete blade hits the second button
the knife blade retracts the razored chain whirring back into the knife hilt
blade spins triggers the first button again the knife blade flies out the razored chain whipping around denlingers throat
the razor chain cuts through denlinoers neck decapitates him
as he ashes blade triggers the knife again
as it ejects he whirls it over his head making a sound like a bull roarer
blade drops low swinging the razored chain
the chain slices through emonds legs
emonds amputated legs ash the rest of him tumbling onto the asphalt
blade retracts the knife blade whirls thrusts it through dohs abdomen
who was coming up from behind
as doh ashes blade returns to emond finishing him off and blade is on the move again rushing after the vampires who escaped
the bike riding vamps cut across traffic then scream down an on ramp to a busy street below
sprinting from the parking lot to the sidewalk
he touches a hand to his ear
we see a tiny receiver tucked within
im on the stonebridge overpass at clemons got it
heading eastbound im just beneath you blade dodges past a honking car stepping onto and over the trunk then leaps atop the safety rail of the overpass as hauling a
semi trailer thunders beneath the overpass sounding its air horn
it has safety cables running along the perimeter of the trailer roof like an aircraft carrier
blade launches himself into the air
he lands atop the semi then tumbles nearly slipping off the edge as he snags one of the safety cables atop the trailer
he dangles above the asphalt then swings himself into the open back of the trailer
we hold for a beat then hear the thunderclap of a high performance engine turning over as rockets out of the back of the trailer sailing right over a car
that was tail gating the semi heading into three lanes of on coming traffic at fifty miles an hour
blade hits the brakes sending the battle scarred muscle car into a spin clipping other vehicles in the process
as cars continue to brake and collide around him blade puts the pedal to the metal once again
the charger accelerates tachometer red lining as blade pulls alongside the cab of the big rig catching a glimpse of whistler grins gives blade a little salute and blade reaches
between the seats activating the newly installed nitrous oxide fuel injection system
the charger jets forward as the nos nitrous system boosts the cars speed by another hp leaving any and everything in its dust
in seconds it has caught up to they draw tec s firing back at blade
the bullet proof windshield holds as do the kevlar body panels protecting the engine but the rounds chew the shit out of the bodywork
blade gives his car another jolt of nitrous
the charger surges forward as stone and campbell fall back veering to either side
now blade is ahead of them
he checks their position in his rear view mirror then stands on the brakes the charger drops from a hundred to fifty in a heart beat causing stone and campbell
to rear end blade
the vamps are ejected over the handle bars of their bikes like crash test dummies
stone smashes through blades back windshield continuing into the front seat while campbell tumbles over blades roof and across his hood somehow managing to cling to one of the windshield
wipers at the last minute
blade clutches the wheel
hes got a howling vampire in the front seat upside down covered in windshield fragments and another perched on his hood obscuring his vision
stone tries to right himself clawing at blade
blade struggles keeping one hand on the wheel while he reaches for a shotgun secured between the seats
as the vampire ashes blade hits a button on the dash
the passenger door opens spills stone onto the road right into the path of an oncoming bus
stone is ground to paste and tourists mostly elderly
the passengers are jolted in their seats as the wheels of the bus ka thump over stones remains i hope that wasnt a dog
and were back in blades charger as campbell continues to hammer away at the windshield
the windshield spiderwebs
campbell manages to get a clawed hand through blade swings his shotgun over shoving it in campbells snarling mouth
he pulls the trigger boom
campbells cinder remains blow over the cracked windshield
blade hits the wipers spritzes window cleaner but the mess turns to ashen sludge
making the view worse
the talor is up ahead weaving in and out of traffic
fighting to see blade accelerates gaining ground the vampire driver leans out of his own wihdow looking back at blade firing an automatic pistol blades windshield already weakened by campbell
shatters blowing glass fragments all over him
undaunted blade calmly reaches for his dash hitting a button labeled uv
roof mounted uv daylights come on bathing the car ahead and more importantly the vampire driver with uv light
the vampire at the wheel shrieks ashes leaving the car driverless
gedge tries to lean over and take the wheel burning remains blow back at us
then the view clears and blade slams his charger into the talon
the cars briefly lock grinding sparks
then they disengage
blade jerks his steering wheel gives the talon another slam
the talon hits the curb riding halfway up onto a sidewalk plowing down newspaper vending machines and table top displays piled with cheap wares then a phone booth a food
pedestrians duck for cover and the talon gets some serious air rolling onto its side as it comes back to earth
wk krunch the wreck skids to a stop against a streetlight
the streetlight creaks crashes down on the wreck
bystanders gather murmuring amongst themselves gedge drags his bleeding body from the wrecked talon
he staggers to his feet clutching a pistol limps away pulls up
blade climbs out shotgun in hand
the shotgun has an under mounted stake launcher
blade fires at gedge
the stake hits him in the back
knocking him onto the street
bystanders scream falling back taking cover blade approaches puzzled
gedge is still alive laughing
he looks at blade eyes crazed flashing his fangs
staked you with silver
why arent you ash
gedge coughs blood struggles to speak why arent you smarter
not a vampire dumbshit set your sorry ass up gedge tugs at his fangs
theyre fake prosthetic
gedge is looking past blade
blade turns looking up danica is perched there
she backs into the shadows
but blade doesnt have time to investigate because police sirens are drawing near
blade retreats to his charger
he guns it speeding away as we blades charger pulls up to a boat house at the waters edge
blade climbs out disappears inside
what the fuck happened tonight
built into the decaying boat house retrofitted for blades combat needs
blade is taking off his body armor tossing weapons onto a work table
how should i know
he was human
whistler reaches for a bottle of whiskey takes a sip
youve been getting careless blade
you kill a vampire they ash dont leave any proof of their existence
but something like this a human corpse its messy shaking his head you better hope nobody ided you
close on a digital video tape being slipped into a player
pull back to reveal danica sitting before a monitor
footage of blade confronting gedge filmed from a high angle
danica smiles and we establishing
it was horrible
the one car crashed and then the guy in the coat was shooting the other guy close on a tv screen
we are watching a news feed
a reporter interviews a woman at the intersection where blade executed gedge
now the reporter turns to the camera
on screen that was just a taste of the mayhem that occurred during tonights brazen shoot out that left at least four people dead
now apparently an anonymous citizen captured the whole event on video the image freezes
we hear the clatter of keyboard keys as we pan over to an adjacent computer monitor where a series of video captures of the event flash by us in slide
agent ray cumblerland studies the screen
ray is a career agent
dedicated and dogged to the point of annoyance utterly humorless
his office is cramped and institutional devoid of any personal touches
its also overflowing with files photographs and charts concerning blade and whistler
features numerous surveillance photos of blade and whistler in action along with various news clippings and two wanted aggravated kidnapping armed violence
most of the photos are blurry and indistinct akin to snaps taken of bigfoot
heard weve got a lead
wilson hale s rays subordinate rushes in excited
ray stands ripping down a photo of blade and whistler
book us a flight hale
time to take these cowboys down
pack of reds and some matches
whistler is buying a pack of cigarettes when he notices on display nearby
the cover story features a blurry photo of blades recent melee with the vampires
whistler picks up the tabloid studying it
next to the photo is an artists sketch of blade
the headline reads gun whistler nods to the cashier hands over some more cash
ill take this too
whistler exits the store perusing the tabloid as he walks
we hear the whir of a cameras high speed motor drive and capture whistler as he moves down the sidewalk
perched on a nearby roof taking surveillance photos
subject is heading west
whip pan to a parked car cumberland and hale seated within
cumberland starts the car starts following whistler
just what we needed
close on the tabloid as whistler slaps it down on a workbench
widen to include whistler and blade
somebody screwed us
your face is all over the papers the television
medias eating it up
like i care
something like this gesturing to the tabloid taking out a human even one working for the vampires far as the rest of the worlds concerned youre public enemy number one
didnt realize this was a popularity contest
whistler shakes his head frustrated
damnit blade dont you see whats happening
the fuckers are finally getting smart
theyre waging a goddamn pr campaign
now its not just vampires we have to worry about were gonna have to take on the rest of the world too
beat adamant theyve got us on the run
these last few months weve barely been staying ahead of the curve
you worry too much old man
ive been doing this since before you were born blade
the moment you stop worrying youre dead
then whistlers face softens for a moment
since the day i found you youve been like a son to me
i taught you everything i know
beat but im tired
its rush hour and the streets are choked with traffic
people mill past on the crowded sidewalk
we move from face to face capturing brief portraits of working class desperation an overweight guy a pair of homeless teenagers an asian vendor a streetwalker
how about that one
they taste like cheetos
what about that shrunken apple head beeyatch a saurus over there
fucking blow me man
we hear laughter and we whip pan over to a grimy office building zipping up the face of it to a skate punk squid gets some air flipping his board
up into a nice ollie backside grab then scoots over to three more punks perched on a concrete ledge watching the people below them
they are proof flick and dingo
all in their teens sporting copious piercings and tattoos
flick wears a ratty t shirt from the lost boys movie
cmon just pick one
once you buy a prize its yours and yours to keep
they keep looking
then flick suddenly points excited got it got it
baby on board
moving below her figure camouflaged beneath layers of clothing
shes in her s lugging a newborn in a babybjorn carrier thats strapped to her chest clutching a bag of groceries in either hand
she looks a little haggard
as we watch she reaches an elevated rail station entrance
dingo nods and smiles approvingly
looks like we got ourselves a combo meal
a series of shots as abigail makes her way into the station passing a few other people here and there
a depressing dimly lit partially open air station
abigail moves out onto the platform which is now deserted
she glances around a bit nervous and finally sits on a bench
just the wind moaning in the tunnels across the platform
then we hear a rustling sound abigail looks right sees nothing
we hear another sound this time from the left abigail looks up briefly glimpsing a figure ducking behind a concrete pillar
unnerved she stands moving a protective hand over her baby
she backs up a few steps trying to look around the pillar but no one is there
then a shadow moves behind her
she senses it spinning but again she seems to be alone
thoroughly frightened now abigail scoops up her grocery bags turns to exit and slams right into dingo and proof
hey pretty lady
dingo and proof reveal their fangs
abigail screams runs right into the arms of flick and squid
they grab her ripping the babybjorn carrier from her chest shoving her back at dingo and proof
in seconds dingo and proof have abigail on the floor
theyre tearing away at her clothing laughing
scream if this hurts chica
removing the baby from its carrier
he holds the baby up only its not a baby
its a doll with the words fuck you
written on its chest
flick is briefly confused and then the baby doll explodes covering flicks face with a cloud of garlic gas
flick recoils retching wiping at his burning face aghhk its fucking garlic
looking back alarmed
then abigail pulls her knee to her chest
a silver spike springs out from the toe of her boot
she kicks up imbedding the spike up through the underside of proofs chin
before dingo has a chance to act abigail gets him in a leglock flipping him back onto his ass
jumps to her feet shedding her coat and hat
long tresses of hair spill around her shoulders
shes not mousy at all
in fact shes beautiful
and cut like an olympic athlete
and equipped with a walking arsenal of weapons
dingo snarls crunch
abigail plants her heel in his face smashing in his nose
she does a cartwheel kicks him again
follows that with flurry of punches
he goes down as flick and squid come charging
squid gets her in a choke hold
she flips him over her shoulder kicking him in the nuts as he lands
he curls up groaning abigail turns back to flick elbowing him in the throat then returns to squid ejecting a silver throwing knife from a spring loaded automated dispenser strapped
to her wrist
she pops the knife through squids chest
he ashes as she reaches behind her removing a crescent shaped device secured to her back
she holds the crescent in the center the curve pointing away from her gives it a twist and chinkt
the device extends from either end telescoping outward into a three foot long metal arc
connecting the two ends of the arc is a powerful buzzing uv laser
abigail lashes out lopping off flicks arm
his arm falls ashing
abigail swings the arc around pushing it forward through flicks mid section like a cheese cutter flick literally falls apart his upper torso sliding from his trunk ashing in the
foreground his burning particles falling away to reveal abigail in the background dingo scrambles to his feet running for his life
abigail gives her uv arc a twist
she secures it behind her back once again unholsters a strange looking bloop gun with a large barrel
she fires a rapidly expanding spherule of anti personnel foam splatters against dingos legs hardening instantly tripping him up dingo goes down again
he panics trying to scrape the gunk off his legs manages to get one of his hands stuck to the hardening mess in the process like a mouse in a
abigail calmly approaches
she stands over dingo staring down at him with a look of cruel indifference
she holsters her bloop gun withdraws another silver stake scream if this hurts chica
and slams the stake into his chest
abigail turns surveying her work
the ashen remains of the vampires are popping and crackling like campfire embers
in thirty seven seconds shes managed to eliminate them all
a train approaches pulls into the station
passengers disembark flood the platform
they tramp all over the ashes of the vampires completely unaware of the recent slaughter
abigail walks against the stream of traffic boards the train
she is the sole passenger as the train pulls away
whistler sits on a cot contemplating the tarnished wedding ring on his hand
he slowly spins it around his finger
blade sits before a small buddhist shrine meditating
his sword rests in a ceremonial holder
near silence punctuated by the intermittent ocean swell outside
we hear the sounds of violence echoing screams gunshots
these are blades thoughts
the inner demons he is constantly trying to tame
the sounds crescendo and blade opens his eyes
something is wrong
blade creeps into the outer room sword drawn
noise behind him turns to see standing in the shadows clutching a handgun
what is it
what youve been worrying about
just the sound of the ocean swell
then two armored swat agents lower in on rappelling lines
crash through a bank of windows on either side swinging in
they fire cannisters of tear gas
as blade moves to engage them whistler rushes into the heart of the armory a reinforced door explodes inward
more agents storm inside
a military zodiac inflatable boat roars up one of the wooden boat ramps laden with gun toting agents
they jump out fanning all over the boat house
he hears a on the floor
on the floor
whistler fires at them then makes a run for it
the agents return fire but whistler ducks behind a concrete pillar cop cruisers unmarked cars and swat trucks sweep in sirens blaring disgorging a small army of police and fbi
police boats are pulling up to the dock
emerge from an unmarked wearing bullet proof vests brandishing firearms
cumberland barks orders into a radio
lock it down
keep them contained
on the rooftops above various swat snipers take position
blade brawls with a half dozen agents sending them flying in all directions
he grabs one agent head butts him throws him into the path of two others then he reaches for another throwing him through a window at the rear out into
the river which runs below as he moves with increased urgency
the armory is filling up with tear gas
coughing and half blind he hurries to a bank of computers types in a series of commands around him synch up showing the same protocol message data protection routine enabled
server protection enabled
server protection enabled
in response a rack of network storage equipment and removable hard drives explodes
then a second rack of equipment explodes as well
from their vantage point below cumberland and the others can hear the explosions
cumberland is on his radio shouting whats going on in there
over radio some kind of self destruct program
theyre fragging their hard drives
whistler keeps moving
an agent gets a clear shot at him fires whistler is hit in the chest
blade sees whistler take the hit but hes cut off from the old man being swarmed by agents whistler staggers keeps moving
he makes it to another bank of computers launches the same protocol
erasing information purging themselves
we see commands workstation protection enabled workstation protection enabled with each successive command the workstations themselves begin self destructing exploding one after another
another agent gets a bead on whistler firing a round into whistlers thigh
whistler screams in anguish as he sees his mentor being slaughtered
then two agents are rushing him tackling blade
as one they fall backwards into another bank of windows crash
the three of them come flying down in a spray of glass landing atop one of the police cruisers below
the roof buckles under their weight windows shattering take him down
an fbi agent raises a coda net gun atop his shoulder taking aim
four projectiles expand out from the barrel carrying a steel net which has been strung between them
the netting hits blade wrapping around him restricting his movements
immediately a small army of agents dive on top of him pummeling away trying to beat him into submission on the verge of losing consciousness whistler props himself against a
piece of machinery
hes bleeding been shot to hell
one of his hands is closed clutching something
agents warily close in around him guns raised
move a finger and youre dead
flipping them off how bout this one
whistler lets his other hand uncurl
hes got a remote in his palm with a tiny digital timer counting down
hes got something in his
the timer reaches zero
rock the workshop knocking the agents back
clouds of fire and flaming debris mushroom outward catching all unawares sweeping them up off their feet with a hurricane force
in the midst of the conflagration blade briefly manages to tear free of his captors but the wall of fire and light is rushing onward sweeping up everything in its
path turning the world to white
we are close on blades perspiration beaded face
his eyelids flutter as he slowly regains consciousness
rise and shine sleepyhead
we are in a room with a one way mirrored window
blade sits hands cuffed behind him bright lights shining down on him
he looks disoriented battered
cumberland and hale are sitting across from blade
special agents ray cumberland and wilson hale fbi
weve been tracking you for a long time
just like all of your victims
blade shuts his eyes as if he could just wish them away
how many people have you killed
those were familiars people who worked for them and by them you mean vampires right
i suppose next youll be telling us that bigfoots in on the conspiracy too
so what kills these bloodsu kers tough guy
maybe you can give us some pointers
counting on his ringers you can stake em right
then theres sunlight what about crosses wilson
do those still work
i dont know ray
what if a vampires jewish
thats a good point
and does garlic work on a hindu vampire
or do you need saffron or something
cumberland shakes his head his smile fading
you can keep doing your song and dance as long as you want blade but its not going to play
youre a stone cold killer
and youre sick as fuck
lets leave the diagnosis to the professionals
standing in the doorway
hes the man we saw on larry king
he takes a seat by blade sets a leather case on a table
my name is doctor vance
im with the department of mental health
ive been charged with conducting a psychiatric evaluation of you
to cumberland and hale gentleman would you mind giving us a few moments alone
they rise exiting the room
vance smiles trying to project a sympathetic air
i imagine this must be very frightening for you
but i want you to know that im here to help
in order to do that however i need to ask you some questions
can you tell me what day it is
blade just stares daggers at vance
what about the president
do you know whos in the white house at the moment
an ass hole
sighing alright then lets talk about vampires what can you tell me about that
on the other side of the mirror cumberland and hale have joined chief vreede
we hear blade and vance via speakers theres nothing to tell
and are you one of them
vance sits forward drawing closer
what about blood
when you drink it do you find yourself sexually aroused
blade just glares at vance
you see it strikes me that this business of vampirism has strong connotations of sexual confusion
bodily fluids being exchanged that sort of thing
you have to ask where that comes from
im wondering for instance what your relationship was like with your mother
were the two of you close
if he escapes hes going to kill this guy
vance steps into the observation room joining chief vreede cumberland and hale
whats your assessment doctor
hes psychotic with paranoid features possessing dangerous levels of sociopathy
hes exhibiting disorganized behavior
he obviously doesnt have a properly formed conscience spreading his hands for his safety and the publics im recommending that he be transferred to county psychiatric for further treatment
this mans wanted in connection with a laundry list of federal crimes
i need him on a plane to the detention center in washington tonight
agent cumberland that man is in no condition to undergo prosecution
cumberland and hale look to vreede with disbelief
chief weve got a federal arrest warrant here that clearly supersedes i dont care about your warrant
were in my jurisdiction now
youve got an issue with that you take it up with the local magistrate
vance shrugs as if to say hes sorry
im sorry gentlemen but the call has already been made
a team from the hospital should be here momentarily to oversee the transfer
asher danica and grimwood enter followed by four vampires dressed as orderlies
the orderlies carry a straightjacket various restraints and a collapsible transport gurney
danica approaches the desk sergeant flashing a hospital id
were here to transfer a patient to county general
vance enters once more
he opens the leather case on the table removing a syringe and an ampule of fluid
speaking softly now just a little something to keep you compliant
the normal dose is two maybe three hundred milligrams
but for a strapping young hybrid like yourself vance pokes the needle of the syringe into the ampule
i think well kick it up to a couple thousand
vance reaches for blades arm
blade struggles tries to pull back but vance manages to inject him nonetheless
that wasnt so bad was it
smiling youre weak arent you
in need of your serum
who wouldve guessed a mere human like myself could overpower you
realizing youre with them a familiar going on five years now
vance extends his arm pulling back his shirt cuff a little to reveal a vampire glyph tattooed on the underside of his wrist
then he pulls his cuff back down smiles at blade
its the end game blade
all their plans are finally coming to fruition
so just sit back and enjoy the show
blade looks to the one way mirror screams
hes one of them
damnit hes working for them
vance looks to the one way mirror as well and shrugs as if to say the mans deranged
what can i do
on the other side of the glass blade looks like a raging lunatic
he extends his hand to vreede
as they do so we see a vampire glyph on the inside of vreedes wrist as well
blade stares at his own reflection in the mirror
he blinks trying to focus but the drug is starting to kick in
an elevator door opens
asher danica and grimwood exit followed by the orderlies who are now wheeling the gurney
as they move down the corridor they pass cumberland and hale who are chasing down chief vreede
just hold it right there danica shoves cumberland aside hard keeps moving past him
cumberland looks to hale
something isnt right about this
blade struggles in the full throes of the drug now
his vision is blurring various objects in the room leaving trails as he shifts his head from side to side and enter followed by two of the orderlies
despite his incapacitation blade attempts to rise
danica plants her heel in his chest shoving him back down
youre not going anywhere
she draws closer enjoying herself
we moved the humans around like pawns blade
used them to flush you out
blade tries to lunge from his chair at her and whack
grimwood punches blade across the jaw
a brutal blow
dont worry captain sunshine
soon as we get you out of here youll get a chance to play
danica motions to the two vampire orderlies
they step forward with the straight jacket start to put it on blade
blade thrashes madly
asher laughs enjoying this
dont make this any harder than it has to be
youre all alone blade
no one can help you now
the one way mirror shatters exploding outward in a shower of slow motion glass fragments carrying with it a body one of the vampire mental health flunkies ashing in mid
air as he sails into the room
seconds later vaults through the blown out window simultaneously drawing two high tech electronic pistols
meet hannibal king s an audacious vampire hunter with an irrepressible grin
slapped to his chest is a hello my name is sticker with the words fuck you written where the name should be
whyd the polish vampire starve to death
danica spins enraged recognizing king instantly he kept biting his own lip
the lights go out
immediately backup lights come on followed by fire alarms
in the ensuing confusion both pistols at asher who drops allowing one of the vampire orderlies behind him to take the hit
but unlike blades victims he disintegrates from the inside out
the reason is kings signature bullets sun dogs explosive rounds that give off concentrated uv light
king whips around firing at danica who leaps behind the table
she quickly upends it using it as a shield flinging it at king
he shifts his weight throwing himself and the chair hes sitting on to the floor
then he kicks out and up connecting with grimwoods mid section sending him flying backwards straight through the wall into the next room
king holsters one of his pistols and hauls blade up
at the same time he fires on asher again missing him lets fly kemosabe
king drags blade to the door into the neighboring corridor
cumberland and hale see them
they reach for their weapons hes getting away
king fires into the room behind him then pulls a grenade secured to a bandolier and tosses it through the doorway an explosion rocks the interrogation room filling the corridor
with smoke knocking cumberland and hale back
king turns his attention to blades handcuffs firing between them freeing blades hands
blade collapses against the wall
hes shaking close to passing out
dont die on me you undead motherfucker
king drags blade up
they continue down the corridor to we met earlier
shes engaged in hand to hand combat with a half dozen uniformed officers
three of them are already down
in seconds she finishes off the other three
we need that serum now
abigail spins dispatching the last officer with a kick to the mid section while tossing a pneumatic injector at king
he snatches it places it in blades hands
blade injects himself in the neck
moments later hes reenergized
he looks to king clear eyed
hey blacula you ready to shake and bake
blade responds by punching king across the jaw
call me that again and ill give you fucking brain damage
king massages his jaw tossing blade a pistol even as grimwood rounds the corner hungry for blood two more vampire orderlies behind him
blade fires round after round of explosive bullets causing grimwood and the others to fall back
blade and king move joining abigail
more smoke darkness only the emergency lights to illuminate the station
a group of policemen spill from a stairwell armed with bullet proof vests
they open fire blade king and abigail retreat into an alcove
theyre pinned down between the vampires and a group of policemen
were pinned down
to blade cant you do something
i cant shoot around corners
as king and blade lay down cover fire abigail reaches behind her withdrawing a device thats been secured there
she gives it a snap and it springs open taking the shape of a crafted from aluminum its limbs imbedded in key positions with vibration dampening modules this bow is
capable of firing an arrow upwards of feet per second
abigail withdraws a silver arrow with a time delay explosive tip from her quiver nocks it in her bow and takes aim at mounted at the end of the corridor
she lets her arrow fly as it banks off the side of the fire extinguisher continuing down the side corridor where it embeds itself in the shoulder of one of
the vampire screams grabbing the shaft ripping it out
then we a tiny egg timer dial on the arrowhead spins
it clicks in place a red led comes on and the arrowhead explodes catching all three vampires with the full force of a uv blast
grimwood ducks away from the blast as the other two vampires ash come racing out of the alcove
they reach a stairwell
blade rips a steel door clear off its hinges tossing it down the stairwell at a phalanx of cop reinforcements who are charging up the stairs
the cops go down like ten pins
blade and company have an opening
but as they charge downward as king and abigail freeze my sword
they still have it
apoplectic are you insane
were practically home free
we cant go hunting for your fucking butter knife now
but blade is already heading back the way they came and hey
come back here
this is supposed to be a rescue
abigail grabs kings shoulder pulling him to the stairs
forget it king
king and abigail rush outside
the station is gated
flashing police cars are surging through the mouth of the gate
then a window on the third floor of the station explodes outward
blade drops three stories landing before king and abigail in a cat like crouch
with his sword in his hand
he looks at king grins flips him off
now we can go
nudging abigail is he epic or what
the police close in around them pinning the trio down with firepower
yet king and abigail seem unconcerned because are washing over them
a beefed up s land cruiser is screaming up the street
the cruiser jumps onto the sidewalk smashes right through the gated wall
screeches to a stop between our trio and the police cars
leans out his window gives a little wave as the rear doors pop open
gruff and compact he looks like a prize fighter
my name is dex
and ill be saving your ass this evening
blade king and abigail scramble into the back of the land cruiser
dex reverses backing out the way he came
the police from the squad cars are firing but the land cruiser is armored and the bullets harmlessly spark off
in the backseat abigail looks through the rear windshield grimwood is running after them actually gaining on the land cruiser
chewing up the asphalt like a cheetah
abigail leans out the rear window nocking a non uv arrow in her bow
she takes aim at grimwood lets the arrow fly shunkt
the arrow sinks into grimwoods eye
he goes down his somersaulting figure quickly receding into the background as the land cruiser speeds away
safe for the moment king basks in the adrenaline rush of a battle well fought
meanwhile dex is on a cell phone
we have him
well be there soon
to blade so my entrance back there what do you think
right on the money
king unhuckles his combat harness revealing a bullet proof vest bereath it thats been riddled with imbedded slugs
who are you people
my names hannibal king
im a hunter like you
re abigail and this little hellion is abigail whistler
abigail just stares back at blade silently appraising him
thats right blade
youre not hearing things
shes whistlers daughter
you see abby dex myself were all part of whistlers contingency plan
king reaches into an inner pocket pulls out a pack of gum
he selects a stick offers one to blade
the land cruiser rockets away disappearing into the night
the land cruiser moves across an abandoned lot towards the weed choked ruins of an old amusement park
we pass by the skeletal remains of a roller coaster a tilt a whirl the vandalized and wood rotted remnants of a carousel
finally the land cruiser turns towards a motorized loading door in the side of a large warehouse and disappears inside
as the door grinds closed the land cruiser stops
king and abigail lead blade through the darkness
in the gloom we see a half dozen vehicles in various stages of being retrofitted with armored panels and weaponry etc
surveillance cameras mounted above track their progress
i thought the vampires murdered whistlers family
im the product of an earlier fling of my dads born out of wedlock
after the murders happened he kept me hidden
he wanted me safe
away from all of this gesturing around them but i guess hunting just runs in our blood
as king and abigail lead blade towards a stairway blade catches sight of peering down at him from atop one of the rafters
as soon as he spots her she ducks into the shadows
they reach the stairway
automated guns mounted on swivel arms lock on them with infra red targeting beams
when i came of age i tracked my dad down told him i wanted in
beat shrugging been doing it ever since
we enter a sprawling industrial facility that is equal parts mechanics shop firing range and laboratory
we glimpse a virtual arsenal of new weaponry and medical equipment including dna sequencers microfuges and electroporaters
the new equipment fights for space alongside the old mountains of mothballed parts from the parks broken thrill rides
here and there we see the oversized fiberglass head of a grinning fun house creature or the mildewed torso of a fortune telling mannequin frozen in its upended booth
welcome to the honeycomb hideout
looking around how do you bankroll this place
see were using cock suckers to pay for the blood suckers
off blades look joke
come on man
this isnt some piddly little hoopty ass operation blade
we take our jobs very seriously
two others pause in their work as king approaches
dex falls in behind them
hedges s is an engineer always lost in his own world
sommerfield s is a frail looking geneticist
shes also blind operating her computers via a voice synthesis program and braille keyboard
you met dex
this is hedges sommerfield king gestures to them in turn
theyre all refugees in one way or another sharing a common guardedness their lives having been shattered by the vampires
nodding back the runt you saw earlier is sommerfields daughter zoe
we call ourselves the nightstalkers
you sound like rejects from a saturday morning cartoon
we were gonna call ourselves the super friends but that was taken
abigail rids herself of her weapons bow arrows silver stakes and knives
she hands her compound bow to hedges
tiller needs adjustment
ill run it through the bow press
blade examines some of the equipment being developed
how many of you are there total
we operate in sleeper cells
when one goes down a new cell activates to pick up the slack
consider us your reinforcements
never been much of a team player
i dont think you understand blade
whistler meant for us to help you
when he died he activated an emergency protocol
all his knowledge she gestures to the computer equipment around her
was transferred to our servers here
and what makes you think you know so much about killing vampires
king reaches for his collar pulling it down to reveal a telltale mass of scar tissue in the shape of a bite mark
well for starters i used to be one
in a sinister tone do i pass the audition
we soar through the night sky diving down towards a cluster of gleaming high tech spires
as we isolate a penthouse apartment atop one of them we hear an angry scream
fucking hannibal king
an impressively decorated loft bespeaking of money power and a certain perverse esthetic
danica slams her fist straight through the wall then spins around enraged
asher and grimwood are there too their wounds being treated by hendrix and a vampire technician
at tie moment theyre trying to remove the arrow protruding from grimwoods eye
an enormous rottweiler sits nearby attentively watching
a trio of guards flinch with every act of violence
danica is strong
clearly no one wants to get in her way
i shouldve ripped his ripped his bleeding heart out when i had the chance
pointing at asher and dont you dare tell me i told you so
asher raises his hands as if to say no harm no foul
danica continues her tantrum smashing a statue apart shattering a heavy glass tabletop
finally she gives it a rest collapsing into a chair shoulders sagging
you through remodeling
face it dan
we got caught with our pants down
we underestimated the nightstalkers
they practically fucking ass raped us
grimwood grunts in pain as the arrow is removed
asher broaches a more serious subject
has he been told yet
about your failure
a man s enters the room
the same being we glimpsed in the vault
he has a haunting gaze and a commanding presence
we will learn who he is momentarily
but for now its enough to know that everyone in the room pays him deference
yes ive been told
he places a hand on danicas shoulder
perhaps its time i entered the fray
close on king buttoning his collar back up
blade abigail and sommerfield are gathered around him
you know the kind of woman that just screams trouble
you see her and every warning bell in your brain starts going off but you still ask for her number
well thats all i ever hook up with
but this betty blew em all away in the shitstorm sweepstakes
king reaches out to a keyboard calling up a piece of surveillance footage on a nearby monitor
the footage features asher and danica and grimwood
its been slowed to a near standstill and now advances frame by frame
her names danica talos
you met her earlier
the man on her left is asher her brother
king types a command
the image zooms in tracking grimwood
the neanderthal behind them is jarko grimwood
king freezes the footage on danicas grainy pixelated face
i picked danica up in a bar had a one night stand with her then spent the next five years playing step and fetch it as her little vampire cabana
beat eventually abigail found me
sommerfield here managed to treat me with a cure
now i kill them
beat thats called turning a frown upside down
we need to pool our resources blade
because hes come back
king tosses a tomb of dracula comic book over to blade
blade glances at the cover then looks at them incredulous
you gotta be kidding me
hes real blade
dig beneath all the movies and myths
all the layers of bullshit thatve cluttered our culture for the last five hundred years and eventually youll strike the truth
incredulous so the movies are true
shaking his head the movies are just a comforting fairytale compared to the real deal
theres no happy ending with this guy
peter cushing isnt going to run in at the last second and save the day with a cross and some holy water
re the comicbook see good old brain stoker he wrote a nice yarn
but the events he described in were only a tiny piece of the mosaic
the rea draculas origin goes back much earlier than that
try six or seven thousand years
off blades astonished look we flash
we see the man we met earlier dracula drake on the banks of the river euphrates striding towards us engaged in fierce battle with ubaidian soldiers
hes clutching the same sword we saw in the ziggurat clad in the same armor
draculas only one of the names hes gone by
now they call him drake
if you believe the legends he was born in ancient sumeria
as drake slashes his sword downward we cut back to king continuing his story
as the hunters monologue progresses we will intercut with drakes own progression through history
brief violent flashbacks
note the backgrounds surrounding drake will be expressionistic digital composites constantly shifting
the focus of the flashes is drake himself fighting a shadowy horde his attire continually evolving through time
nobody really knows the specifics of his origin
but we do know this he was the first of his kind
the patriarch of the hominus nocturna
we are in egypt now circa bc
drake wages war against the hyksos
he is closer to the camera
and will continue to move closer with each successive flashback
every single vampire every single monster thats walked the earth since then owes their existence to him
back to king holding court before blade and abigail
hes like the patient zero of evil
the original serpent in the garden of eden
and just like the great white shark hes never had to evolve
this guy was born perfect
scour the history books flash
the peloponnesian war southern thrace circa bc
we see dracula battling athenians
even closer now his face spattered with blood
at the same time the soundtrack is gradually swelling expanding in complexity and volume
read between the lines flash
th century ad battling the goths
with every swipe of his sword we wipe forward into the future
youll find countless references to him
always mentioned never named
th century ad the reign of charlemagne
battling the vikings
the flashbacks come faster now assaulting us with ever increasing rapidity
drake continues striding forward while the rest of the world evolves around him centuries whizzing by via computer generated time lapse photography
hes been there flash
th century ad the time of the crusades
the violence intensifies
moving behind the scenes flash
th century france the time of louis the xiv
the pace becomes breathless
cutting a bloody path through the ages until suddenly flash
th century russia the time of peter the great
the soundtrack is thunderous
drake has become a bloody blur of bestial rage and unfettered horror and just like that king snaps his fingers
we are back in the present
he up and disappeared
about a century ago the trail went cold
then we heard a rumor
the vampires were searching for him trying to find the place where hed retreated
according to our information they found him in iraq about six months ago
beat and he was pissed
near silence as the cacophonous soundtrack recedes into the background replaced by the steady drone of inner city traffic
viewed through a long lens clad in modern casual attire striding in slow motion down a pedestrian choked sidewalk
the pulse of the people
and over this intruding the doppler effect wailing of an approaching car as it rushes past us in a screen wipe until we are drake studies a window display
costumes and monster masks and vampire novelties
we see vampire lunchboxes dracula plush dolls plastic fangs key chains
even dracula bobbleheads
drake stands in stark contrast to the mass marketed caricature on display before him
the store is crowded with low end junky goods that might appeal to tourists visiting hollywood boulevard
a pallid goth guy cashier sits behind a counter eating from a takeout container
hes wafer thin with a detached attitude
further back is a sultry goth vixen
behind them on a tv a cartoon is playing
an animated vampire cavorts little bit like the hot stuff devil from ritchie rich comicbooks in the window you sell vampire merchandise
goth guy looks up wiping his mouth with a napkin
doesnt want to engage with drake at all
uh yeah look around we might have a few things
he and the goth vixen have a snicker at drakes expense
then she tries to be a little more helpful
weve got dracula lunchboxes
did you see those
and therere bobbleheads pez dispensers
weve got just about anything selecting a vampire shaped vibrator playful even vampire vibrators
as drake looks around what he sees matches his ascending rage
costumes candles vampire christmas ornaments
posters from different films nosferatu lugosi lee then love at first bite and the little vampire
here check this out she reaches into a case pulling out a soft drink
the label reads dra cola and has a stylized vampire on it
makes you want to cry doesnt it
drake just stares at the can
his mind seems to have retreated elsewhere
back through the ages
was there something special you needed
drake doesnt respond
a kind of melancholy has settled over him
hes an outsider now
the world has moved on
hey guy shes talking to you
drake looks up as goth guy pours a bowl of count chocula
goth guy comes flying through the display window his trajectory taking his body clear across the street and into the display window of the store opposite us
goth vixen screams
drake lashes out
hauling her over the counter
he sinks his teeth into her throat drinking her blood with wild abandon
he consumes it so quickly that his skin flushes bright red
then drake tears his head away lifting his face upward as he flings the girl aside unleashing an ear splitting roar
and for a brief moment the bones of his face seem to shift once again hinting at another shape drake might take
drakes roar echoes through the canyons of downtown
the sun rises over the decrepit amusement park
sunlight slices down through skylights bathing blade king abigail and sommerfield in its warmth
zoe has joined them
shes still cautious and shy but shes also curious
why wake up drake now
thats what weve been trying to figure out
when i was under the fang there used to be talk about some kind of vampire final solution
but i could never figure out why theyd want to destroy their food source
i mean seems stupid right
theyve always had plans for the human race
seems likely that whatever theyre cooking up drakes return is a part of it
blade nods pensive
lets face it blade were fighting a losing battle
so we kill a few hundred of them a year
there are thousands of them out there
maybe tens of thusands
we need a new tactic
a biological weapon
sommerfield moves to her braille keyboard types
we see a real time magnified view of a virus replicating
for the last year ive been working with synthesized dna in order to create an artificial virus targeted specifically at vampires
were calling it daystar
think about it blade
we could wipe them all out in a single move
so whats been holding you back
sighing weve tried it on a number of captive subjects
weve got the disease vector worked out fine its easily transmittable
but the lethality in vampires is still spotty
bottom line is we need a better dna sample to work with
beat we need draculas blood
vampire dna is a hodge podge of different genes mixed in with all sorts of useless junk dna
because draculas the progenitor of the vampire race his dna is still pure
it hasnt been diluted by a hundred generations of selective mutation
it still has all the necessary cellular compounds for the virus to code to
we get his blood we can boost daystars viral efficacy to a hundred percent
you want to join our club
can we sign you up for a nightstalkers secret decoder ring
the sun at its zenith a darkened room relatively austere
the only source of light are a series of small slitted skylights in the ceiling above
from these skylights narrow blinding white shafts of sunlight knife downward to penetrate the gloom
sits in a chair his body partially illuminated by one of the sunlight shafts his face turned upward into its brilliance
drake opens his eyes sees danica hovering in the darkness just on the edge of a shaft of light
this world sickens me
the humans have soiled it with their filth
we can raze their cities to the ground
we can bring the old world back
drake just stares at her not convinced
re light i cant
and do you know why
off danicas silence once all of my kind could brave the day
we were true predators
the world was ours
and then somewhere along the way the purity of our bloodline became diluted
polluted with human dna
thats impossible is it
drake stands drawing close to danica
he grips her wrist you are bastard children
no longer as pure as you pride yourselves on being
and pulls her hand towards one of the sunlight shafts
to her credit danica keeps staring at drake
shell be damned if she will give him the satisfaction of seeing her break
drake pulls her hand closer to the light to the very edge
and the tips of danicas fingers begin to burn
she winces clearly in agony and drake releases her hand
she cradles it against her chest blinking away tears that have welled up in her eyes
how far you have fallen
drake reaches out brushes a tear from danicas cheek then turns and walks away through the alternating shafts of sunlight and darkness
blade king and abigail stand before a table where an assortment of weaponry and ammunition has been laid out on display
hedges is there too assisting them
weve got a wide assortment of ass kickery for your viewing pleasure hefting a pistol electronic pistol
comes with a built in fingerprint security system
fires a three shot burst in th of a second
bullets can also be triggered remotely
king tosses blade a bullet
he studies it its more complex than a standard round
but with a concentrated burst of uv light instead of your standard hollow points
i call em sun dogs
to hedges hedges super size me baby
hedges tosses king one of the four barreled firearms
on the stock is an irreverent decal of the mud flap girl silhouette
this little mamacita a modified version of the armys objective individual combat weapon
pick your poison stakes sun dogs heat seeking mini rockets
whatever gets you hard this puppy will pump out
gesturing to blades sword sarcastic of course it doesnt have the range of a sword but next hedges shows blade the crescent shaped device that abigail used
he gives the device a twist and we call this the uv arc chinkt
the device extends from either end telescoping outward
connecting the tips is a concentrated uv laser
you hold the arc in the center curved away from you
connecting the tips is a powerful uv laser beam
because of its high focus the laser cuts through vampire flesh like a knife through butter
were still trying to sort out fact from fiction when it comes to dracula
turning into mist
kinda doubt it
but general shape shifting
off blades look not into a bat or a wolf or anything like that
but another human someone with the same approximate body mass given enough practice it might be possible
he wouldnt have a traditional skeletal structure
probably something more like a snake with thousands of tiny bones in the place of a normal array
commensurate with this would be an exquisite control of electrical potential across his tissues resulting in an ability to effectively change shape at will raising his hand question
have you ever been laid hedges
blade king and abigail newly suited up for war moving towards the land cruiser
time to apply some pressure
the weak link in the vampire chain of command has always been their familiars
vampires cant go out in the day so they get humans to do their dirty work for them blood running safe house maintenance whatever climbing in the cruiser we bleed
the wanna be vampires theyll lead us to the real thing
blade starts the engine
blade looks to abigail who sits in the back
she has a laptop on her knees and is assembling an mp playlist
shes making playlists
likes to listen to mp s when she hunts
her own internal soundtrack you know
dark core trip hop whatever kids these days are listening to
im more of a kenny g fan
finished abigail slips her earbuds into her ears turns on her portable mp player
the smoking bassline of jurassic s a day at the races kicks in as blade king and abigail cruise the streets in a jagged fast forward montage
the land cruiser jumps the curb screeching to a stop in front of a scuzzy bar
amidst a wall covered with graffiti and flyers we see a vampire glyph
blade kicks open the door
a couple of low lifes take notice
blade moves around the bar opening a refrigerator we see packs of refrigerated blood inside
one of the low lifes takes off running back past the bathroom shouldering a door at the rear stumbling right into abigails arms
she trips him up swinging him around pinning an arm behind him
she pulls the back of his collar down sees a vampire glyph we cant hear what the familiar is saying but hes squealing raising his hands in a please dont
hit me anymore manner
the land cruiser rockets down the streets
in quick succession we see a half dozen underworld dives a pool hall an internet cafe an electronics repair shop all are fronts for vampire operations featuring back rooms with
refrigerated blood and high tech coffin like beds where the vampires can safely sleep through the day unmolested
in each new location blade king and abigail resort to oldfashioned strong arm tactics blade head butts a familiar
king punches a familiar across the jaw
abigail kicks a familiar in the stomach
cut to a flurry of extreme close ups of vampire glyphs being exposed on the backs of familiars necks one after another as familiars have their heads cainfully smashed against
walls car hoods pool tables into windows and doors and garbage cans
the bullying moves come faster the shots becoming more and more abstract until wham
blade tosses hoop a skinny familiar off a roof
its a four story drop
hoop falls screaming but then jerks to a stop about twenty feet down dangling upside down
we see now that hoop has rope tied around one of hoops ankles
and blade is clutching the other end of the rope
blade hauls hoop back up but still keeps him dangling upside down
king and abigail look on
want another spin ass hole
eventually your heads gonna pop off
oh jesus please please whos your handler
i dont know his name i swear i blade prepares to drop hoop again but a cell phone in hoops jacket rings
blade fishes it out
the screen reads edgar vance
vance the psychiatrist who gave blade the mental evaluation is cruising in his pacific blue xkb convertible jaguar
hes wearing sunglasses talking on his cell phone
this is dr
did someone page me
blade ends the call then looks to hoop smiling cruelly
blade lets hoop drop
the familiar plunges four stories screaming
lands dead center in a goodwill box below
a high tech office complex surrounded by meticulously groomed grounds
a sign with a swanky vance institute logo zooms
blade king and abigail approach taking note of vances jaguar complete with vanity plate parked in front
hey blade why didnt the vampire bite mick jagger
off blades look cause you cant get blood from a stone
as blade walks off hey they cant all be gems
the trio enter drawing stares from a number of patients gathered in a reception area
nearby is a large display with vances grinning face
beneath it text reads nearby is a bank of monitors showing a snazzy video featuring a beautiful young couple marvelling at a sunrise
on monitors regain control of your life
wake to a new dawn
at the vance institute for whole being we believe in an integrated approach to human health
the image cuts to vance himself poised on the edge of his desk smiling
as blade and company move through the institute the video plays counterpoint to their progress
welcome to our facility
as a member of the medical profession i want to assure you that i will do everything in my power ro provide you with the care and compassion that you
past the reception desk are the elevators with more monitors showing the video greeting
as blade king and abigail approach two security guards move to intercept them
excuse me can i help y crack
blade effortlessly tosses the guards aside sending them crashing into the nearest monitors
the trio continue
a doctor steps out of a doorway
king punches him in the face
we see another video monitor
what does it mean to be human
since the dawn of creation our ancestors have asked ourselves that question
they round the corner nearly colliding with two more security guards
blade takes them both out
theres another video monitor
the modern world today is filled with countless challenges
in every direction we look toxic stressors are impacting upon our happiness
we think were healthy but the truth is our immune systems are engaged in a life or death struggle to maintain our well being
blade king and abigail storm in
an executive assistant is moving to stop them
im sorry but you cant abigail kicks out the mans knee then slices her hand into his windpipe silencing him
now id like to take a moment to exolain how a series of remarkable new breakthroughs can immeasurably improve the quality of your life blade aims his shotgun at the
door leading to vances office
he fires at the keycard lock kicks down the door startling dr
vance himself who is rising up from behind his desk
vance is wiping his mouth not dressed like a doctor would normally be
but we hardly notice this as what
blade aims his shotgun at vances head
vance just smiles seemingly unconcerned as abigail circles around the other side getting a view behind vances desk where lies on the floor
his throat has been ripped out
and this body is dressed like a doctor
king puts it together first reaching for a silver stake even as we hear the sound of popping cartilage coming from beneath the vance doubles flesh jesus its him
the vance double jumps atop the desk and swats the muzzle of blades shotgun aside re directing the blast which shatters a glass window
then he kicks blade in the chest knocking him clear across the office as king advances
the vance doubles face warps the bones in his head shifting around
he reaches for king slams him onto the desk twists the stake from kings hand and brutally shoving it into kings rib cage pinning him to the desk top
then the vance double whirls around to engage abigail only we see that its drake now having taken vances shape
back hands abigail across the face a teeth jarring blow
she spins falling and drake is moving like a hurricane leaping through the window that was shattered by blades shotgun blast
he looks out the window sees drake landing on the ground some three stories below
drake runs with inhuman speed
he effortlessly scales a chain link fence then barrels straight through a wooden barricade sailing over a trash dumpster
seconds later blade follows catching sight of drake rushing out into a crowded urban market
what unfolds is a foot chase at super human velocity
vampire and hunter are moving at least twenty miles an hour battering aside various pedestrians smashing through and over stalls of merchandise
drake emerges onto the sidewalk of a busy street four lanes of rush hour traffic whizzing past
abruptly drake cuts into the traffic leaping atop the hood of an oncoming car
the cars horn sounds brakes squeal
jumping onto the hood of another car
more horns sound
in this manner
drake and blade race across the flowing traffic itself
using the hoods and roofs of the cars like moving stepping stones
drake mounts the steps of an older apartment building thunders his way through the main entrance blade is on drake like a shadow
were internal now the sound of blades labored breath moving to the foreground of the soundscape
a barking dog darting from a doorway
up ahead an old man has been knocked over
an insane dash up two flights of stairs then down a corridor passing more tenants
somewhere a woman screams
we hear glass breaking and my baby theres another open door blade tears into an apartment passing a hysterical woman an upended crib
he sees a broken window by a fire escape cut onto the fire escape
a glimpse of drake overhead
blade clambers up the fire escape moving in a near blur
one story of steps up the rickety metal ladder smash
a large planter comes down from above nearly striking blade
he lets go with one hand swings outward then hes climbing again
a cloud of pigeons take wing flapping frenetically about him momentarily blinding him
another story a third a fourth
as he reaches the top blade jumps catching the edge of the roof above him flipping himself over and onto the roof
he lands in a cat stance drawing his sword quickly scanning the area
so youre the hunter they all fear
blade spins stands on the ledge of the roof cradling an infant in his arms
in the full glare of the afternoon sun
re infant just so we understand each other daywalker
with his free hand he massages his jaw
we hear a few more pieces of popping cartkage as the very last of drakes cermanent features seem to settee into clace
why did you kill vance
hed outlived his purpose
hed become a liabi ity
drake nods at blades sword your sword ive seen that hilt before
eight or nine centuries ago
the hunter who carried it was an accomplished fighter
drake in his armor head to head with a th century vampire hunter
the hunter has blades sword
drake tears the sword from the hunters grasp turns it around thrusts it back through the mans chest
and as the man gasps we are back to here and now
he was honorable in his own way
he died a good death
i wouldnt know about that
youre part of a grand tradition blade
you hunters have plagued my people since the day we first walked the earth
and i have vanquished them
one by one
blade pauses looking for some kind of opening
how can you exist in the daylight
ive always been able to
havent you read mr
i was the first of the vampires
i am unique
realizing thats why they brought you back
my children seek to isolate the properties in my blood that make me immune to sunlight
through me they believe they can all become daywalkers
drake glances down at the street people
throngs of people are massing there pointing up at him
the worlds changed much since i went to sleep
how crowded its become
look at them down there
lives brief as fireflies
do you think they can ever grasp what it means to be immortal like us
youre not immortal
i mustve heard a hundred of you people make the same claim
and every one of thems seen the end of my sword
drake smiles intrigued by an obviously worthy opponent
perhaps i will as well then
but i think its more likely that you will fall before mine
drake tosses the infant at blade
blade twists around to catch it scooping it safely up
but when he looks back drake is gone
close on king being propped up against the wall by abigail
blade has joined them
king is in terrible pain
jesus it hurts
i wanna be a vampire again fuck
did you see that guy
were gonna lose man
were gonna fucking lose
abigail ignores king cuts open his shirt
she removes a small aerosol cannister from her belt
fibrin sealant foam its an elastic protein
help me spread the wound open
the foam should seal the hemorrhaging in his body cavity from within together they spread the wound apart
king is really hurting breathing hard as he tries to fight back the pain
hey hey whatd the one lesbian vampire say to the other
shut up king
see you in twenty eight days kings voice trails off as he passes out
abigail triggers the dispenser spraying a jet of compressed foam into it
the foam condenses sealing the wound up
blade and abigail enter the hq hauling king between them
dex and hedges rush to meet them relieving them of king
exhausted and covered in blood abigail retires to her quarters stripping off her clothes
abigail stands beneath he showerhead turning her face up into the scalding spray rinsing the blood from her body
close on the drain by her feet blood swirling down it
king drowses on a cot
his shirt is off and his chest has been bandaged
he opens his eyes sees blade above him
hey blade say were successful
say we wipe the vampires out
what happens then
you ever ask yourself that
weakly somehow i dont picture you parked on a porch with a jigsaw puzzle
king drifts back into unconsciousness again leaving blade left to ponder his words
later sommerfield and hedges consult with blade and abigail
so basically were in an arms race
theyre using drakes dna to build themselves a better vampire noddin and we need his blood to kill them
to sommerfield hows this weapon of yours coming along
were almost there she gestures to a series of ampule like prototypes
well see the completed version of this device later on
the virus is harmless to humans
so we decided to go after the vampires food source
the one thing we know for sure about vampires is that they have to drink blood
if we manage to pull this off well be able to contaminate every blood source on the planet
they wont have anyone left to feed on
doesnt do us any good if we dont have time to finish it
we cant just sit here
we need to take the battle to them
sommerfield lowers her head thinking
if the vampires are trying to isolate the hereditary factor in drake that makes him immune to sunlight theyll require certain kinds of laboratory equipment and provisions
for instance theres an enzyme called taq polymerase
and there are only a limited number of suppliers
beat give me a few hours
ill see if i cant hunt us up some leads
moving towards the mirrored windows we hear labored breathing
close on hands clasped together a man and a womans
close on danica s face covered in sweat in the throes of passion
she looks up eyes glazed pull back to reveal drake propped above her thrusting away
danica has her limbs wrapped around drake holding on for dear life
both are awash in moonlight
the two of them climax
drake withdraws studying danica
shes naked but for the tiny silver crucifix she wears around her neck
drake nudges the crucifix with his finger
why do you wear that symbol
defensive old habits she sits up draping a sheet over her
i was a good catholic school girl once
drake nods his thoughts distant
i was there when they crucified him
he died for their sins not mine
playful y and what are your sins
would you care to confess them
shaking his head too numerous to remember
nodding at the crucifix take it off
ill make you a better one
drake draws her in biting her gently on the neck sinking his fangs into her flesh
he pulls his head back
two rivulets of blood trickle from the fresh wounds
theres an old saying drake reaches for the sheet pulling it away from danicas chest
then he dips his fingertips into her flowing blood painting a long streak of it down between her breasts
kill one man youre a murderer
kill a million a king
smiling kill them all a god
close on a pneumatic injector
pull back to reveal blade injecting himself with his serum
no violent spasms like before
blades body now accepts the serum
crouched on an old piece of carny equipment watching him
why do you do that
theres something bad inside of me
this keeps it from getting out
zee considers this
why cant you just be nice
i think ive got a lead
sommerfield stands at her computers reading a tactile braille display
blade and abigail are nearby
theyve been buying up all sorts of supplies taq polymerase bone marrow growth supplement genetic sequencing enzymes
well check it out
a high tech research park
hendrix the vampire doctor we saw earlier sits at a computer workstation
chief vreede confers with him
we hear a knock at the door
hendrix looks to vreede
they obviously werent expecting anyone
hendrix moves to the door checking a surveillance monitor
he cant see anyone outside
he shrugs turns to leave and crunch
the door is smashed inward taking much of the door frame with it flattening hendrix
blade and abigail step inside
as blade hauls hendrix up from the ground abigail points her already drawn gun at he was reaching into his jacket for his own piece now thinks better of it
doing a little moonlighting chief
blade nods to abigail
she reaches onto vreedes jacket to disarm him
blade grips hendrix by the shirt collar
we need to talk
blade punches hendrix in the face
hendrix sags for a moment stunned
now spill it bite boy
wiping a bloody nose you know what were doing
drake has come back to us
soon well all be daywalkers
and when that day comes the world will truly be ours
blade nods towards the back of the lab where another door a very secure one is located
whats back there
hendrix shoots a quick look to vreede
then he turns on blade all fangs and claws trying to tear blades eyes out abigail fires her uv gun with blinding speed and hendrix is dead before he knows
ashing all over blade
blade brushes hendrix s remains from coat collar shoots abigail a look did you really have to do that
blade looks to the floor
aside from some cinders all that remains of hendrix are his glasses and a singed keycard
blade picks up the keycard looks to vreede
whats behind door number one
theyll kill me an evil grin so will i
but ill enjoy it more
they move towards the door
blade slides the security card
an inset light changes from red to green
vreede punches in a numeric code
the doors slide open blade abigail and vreede emerge into a cavernous room
god in heaven hang from gantries preserved in fluid filled pods suspended by wires like nightmarish marionettes
the bodies are hooked up to an elaborate system of biosensor feeds and ivs which are designed to replenish vital nutrients
what was this place
vreede pauses before answering looking uncomfortable
its a blood farming facility
elaborating they decided that hunting humans on a piece meal basis was too inefficient
why kill your prey when you can keep them alive
under optimal conditions a donor can generate anywhere from fifty to a hundred pints of blood a year
sickened but where did you get all these people
in any given year youve got two to three million homeless people wandering around america shrugging no one cares about them
were doing the country a service really
blade shakes his head admiring the horrible efficiency
the vampire final solution
abigail moves towards one of the pods touching her hand to the glass studyihg the comatose person within
are they aware
do they feel anything
shaking his head theyre in a chemical induced coma
theyre brain dead vegetables
blade angrily slams vreedes face against one of the pods
look at this
is this the future you want
you think theres a place for you in their world
vreede starts crying blubbering
we dont have a choice
theyre going to win dont you see that
hes come back
theres nothing stopping them now
blade pulls vreede back so theyre nose to nose theres me
and blade releases vreede
youve got thirty seconds
vreede turns and runs stumbling towards the door
despite his promise blade lifts his mach
without even looking in vreedes direction blade fires
we hear vreede drop
blade turns to abigail
she can hardly contain herself
nearby is a control console
blade unloads his mach pistol into it damaging the interlinked life support systems
one by one the vital signs and ekgs on the pods flat line their warning tones rising into a collective piercing wail
feeling a heavy weight lets go
blade and abigail leave turning the lights out as they go
a basketball hoop has been set up in the back area and dex and hedges are engaged in a wicked game of one on one
scm erfield works refining the virus
because she is blind she doesnt need light
h er computers voice synthesis program has been activated and its currently reading the various statistics that appear on her main monitor
beat at the same time sommerfield is reading aloud to zoe who sits nearby
the book is the emerald city of oz and its in braille
sommerfield scans with her fingers
the reason most people are bad is because they do not try to be good
now the nome king had never tried to be good so he was very bad indeed
having decided to conquer the land of oz and to destroy the emerald city and enslave all its people king roquat the red kept planning ways to do this dreadful
thing and the more he planned the more he believed he would be able to accomplish it we see whistler approaching through the garage
the steel door slides open and whistler enters
king drowses on a cot
he hears a noise opens his eyes
whistler stands in the doorway
you get me those fruit roll ups like i asked surprised dude
arent you dead
whistler doesnt respond
king tries to sit up but whistler places his hand on kings mouth shoving him down starting to smother him
king struggles confused
dex manages to steal the ball from hedges makes a shot
behind them whistler enters the makeshift court
abruptly the sounds of the one on one game stop
we hear a thud from the back of the warehouse like someone falling
sommerfield looks to the storage area
the silence is unnerving
she turns off her voice synthesis program
then closes the book
the basketball comes bouncing out
it rolls coming to rest against a workbench
there are blood spatters on the ball
sommefrield reaches for her cane
she tap taps her way to the ball feels the blood
knows what it is
zoe go find some place to hide sweety
sommerfield senses it and lashes out with her cane banging a rack of equipment startling the girl
get out of here zoe
the girl scurries away
sommerfield tap taps with her cane moving towards the storage area
she finds a gun cabinet feels around with her hands locates an electronic pistol
dex and hedges are sprawled on the floor before her having been slaughtered
blood is everywnere
she doesnt see them of course
but we do
revealing whistler crouched right behind her
shes unaware of his presence
and as we watch his facial features shift
we hear the sickening sounds of cartilage popping and we realize that its drake not whistler
with mounting dread sommerfield turns towards the sound
and then drake is upon her rushing forward with a growl
as sommerfields agonized screams echo through the warehouse zoe rushes into the bathroom looking for a place to hide
she considers the lockers discounts them
then settles on near the floor
its about fourteen inches wide just barely big enough for her to squeeze into
zoe kneels prying the grate off
inside a heating duct extends four feet before making a ninety degree turn upward
zoe climbs into the duct feet first scooting her body backwards
then she reaches for the grate securing it back on sealing herself inside
its cramped and claustrophobic inside the duct
shes managed to force herself all the way back to the ninety degree turn by curling up into a near fetal position
mostly tile floor and a small portion of the open doorway leading to the hallway outside
she listens trying to hear past the sound of her own breathing which has been magnified because of the ducting
the screams from the outer rooms have stopped
then a pair of boots appear in the doorway drake
zoe holds her breath
we hear drake searching the bathroom opening the lockers and bathroom stalls
drakes boot clad feet pass by the grate again closer tn s time
they pause for an interminable moment zoe shuts her eyes
she cant stand it
finally we hear drakes footsteps receding away
relieved zoe takes in a breath and opens her eyes drakes face is right there
pressed up against the other side of the grate staring at her
with a roar drake rips the grate off
he tries to climb inside but the width of the duct is too narrow to accommodate the size of his upper body
instead he reaches his right arm in extending his clawed hand as far as he possibly can
zoe whimpers trying to compress her mass into an even tighter ball having reached the limits of its extension his fingertips only a few scant inches from zoes face
zoes been allowed a moments reprieve
he cant reach her
but then we hear the sound of popping cartilage
of tiny bones shifting beneath drakes flesh
drakes fingers are elongating snake like reaching for zoes face rapidly closing the space whici separates them the real blade and abigail are returning
the sliding garage door opens and the land cruiser glides inside
blade and abigail enter
the place is dark
they know instinctively that somethong is wrong
blade tries a nearby light
the power is out
they both draw their weapons
blade turns on a flashlight
they move onto the darkness shadows loom everywhere
its like a tornado touched down inside
equipment lies smashed tables and chairs have been overturned
sommerfields lab area has been destroyed
king blade and abigail rush to the infirmary area but king is gone and the place has been trashed
they move into the back area
they find dex and hedges on the floor their bodies bled desecrated
realizing zoe wheres zoe
with increased urgency blade and abigail search the headquarters the bathroom the garage every nook and cranny
with each moment abigail becomes more panicked
where is she
they cant find her anywhere
blade and abigail enter
a thin stream of blood snakes its way across the shower tiles
taey follow it discovering her body propped up mock crucifixion style in the showers
on the wall nearby someone has written a message in blood he knows damn well who left him the message
as tears streak down abigails cheeks she rushes to sommmerfields body
together she and blade get her down
abigail clutches sommerfield slowly rocking the body in her arms
blade puts a hand on her shoulder
abigail doesnt respond
her whole body is shaking
more firmly use it
abigail raises her head her eyes filled with hatred
blade doesnt let up
hes like a drill instructor galvanizing her with his words
abigail lifts her head toward the heavens letting loose a tortured scream that erupts from the very pit of her soul
abigails scream echoes over the moonlit cityscape
close on kings bloody face
a dog is licking it
king stirs his eyes fluttering open the rottweiler we saw earlier is slobbering all over him
pull back to reveal king on his knees shirtless both wrists secured behind him in a high tech pillory
king tries to twist his head away from the dog
the rottweiler growls
back off pooch the rottweilers jaws open revealing more teeth than any dog should probably have
its muzzle splits in two as both sides of the rottweiler mandible fold back on either side of its head disgorging a hellish and barbed tongue stalk
the mutant dog roars ready to bite kings face off and jesus christ
grimwood appears from off screen laughing pulling the animal back
we see danica and asher now as well
what the fuck
what the fuck
his names beau
weve been experimenting with porting the vampire gene over into other species
as asher pets the rottweiler its muzzle closes back up again
it looks up at him panting happily tongue lolling
you made a goddamn vampire dog
poor little king
you look so distraught
danica wipes a little blood from the corner of kings mouth
she touches her fingertips to her tongue tasting his blood
youre tasting a little bland lover
not getting enough fatty acids in your diet
have you tried mackerel
how about you take a sugar frosted fuck off the end of my dick
oh therell be time to play doctor later believe me
but for now we need to have a little talk
beat tell us about this bio weapon youve been building
i can tell you two things
and diddly just left the building
grimwood steps forward throttling king for a moment
spit it out you fucking fruitcake
okay heres the deal with the weapon coughing its a new flavor crystal formula
twice the chocolaty goodness half the calories
plus it helps prevent tooth decay grimwood moves in to choke him again but danica intervenes
youre brave king ill give you that
but underneath all your swagger she leans closer caressing his face
i know what you really fear
what would hurt you more than anything else
kings smile falters for a moment
maybe she does know
she rubs her cheek against his
you dont want to go back to being one of us her lips grazing his do you
king tries to turn his head away but danica grips his chin turning his head back
hes sweating now
im going to bite you again king
and then im going to leave you here while you turn
im going to watch you day after day while the thirst keeps building and building
and then when you cant stand it anymore she nods
drake appears holding zoe
held firm in drakes arms
im going to bring the little girl for you to feed on
would you like that king
would you enjoy taking her life
king shuts his eyes sickened at the thought
now were getting somewhere my pet
abigail sits in her workshop area restringing one of her bows
nearby is a table with an assortment of equipment a bow press vise stand string jig bow scales and wrench sets
across the way is a shooting range with a variety of targets set up a wall of netting behind them to catch stray arrows
theres also a chronograph outfitted with a ballistic computer to measure arrow speed
close on abigails hands as she works with a quiet precsion re setting the arrow rest making minor adjustments to the center shot position and wheel timing etc
appears in the doorway watching her
brusque ill be fine
hes going to leave her alone but then he hesitates wrestling to say something
dont let it turn inward
abigail takes a deep breath pausing in her work
it already has
since i can remember ive had this knife of sadness in my heart
as long as it stays there im strong
but the moment i pull it out turning back to him ill die
he understands all too well
she stands moving to the shooting range
she straps on a quiver takes aim at about a hundred feet away
just in front of the target is the chronograph which looks like a miniature set of goal posts
abigail fires an arrow
it flies through the arms of the chronograph sinking into the targets s chest
on the screen of the ballistic computer the arrows speed is clocked at feet per second
we move closer to her now as whoosh
abicail fires again
the speed is fps
now the speed is fps
even closer whoosh
the arrow speed creeps up and up as we move closer and closer to abigail until we pull back
abigail has fired every arrow in her quiver
the arrows have formed a cross in the targets chest
one vertical grouping running up another horizontal grouping bisecting it
blade stands at the open entrance
abigail steps out
looks like shes made peace with herself for the moment
im ready to go
headlights appear in the distance
another land cruiser approaches weaving through the amusement park
it pulls to a stop in front of them
the drivers side window rolls down
sits behind the wheel
he raises a hand in greeting
my name is caulder
and ill be your driver this evening
caulders land cruiser glides through the streets
where are you taking us
we told you blade
we operate in sleeper cells
when one goes down a new cell activates to pick up the slack
caulder pulls up in front of a fish supply store
caulder unlocks an accordion security gate opens the door
he leads blade and abigail through the darkened aisles
there are fish tanks on either side aerators bubbling aquatic animals of every kind swimming about
is another arsenal lab area
this one is smaller than the nightstalkers main headquarters
caulder moves to a computer calls up a file
a dialogue box for a media player opens
caulder activates a video file
sommerfield left a video message for you
the video plays
we see sommerfields face on the screen
she looks grave as if she might have been crying
on video if youre watching this im already dead
if zoes still alive i want you to promise youll take care of her
ive been reading her the oz books every night
we just started the emerald city of oz the one with the nome king her voice cracks and she pauses wiping away a tear
i think ive managed to cultivate a workable strain of the daystar virus
as a precaution i transmitted the genetic sequence to caulder in case our main stock was destroyed
in order for it to achieve maximum lethality youll need to interfuse it with drakes blood
if it works any vampires in the immediate vicinity should die almost instantly
after that it should take only a few weeks for the virus to spread throughout the rest of the world
zoe hesitates deciding how to broach the next subject
theres one other thing blade
you need to know that theres a chance the virus could destroy you too
because youre a hybrid im not sure whether your immune system will be able tolerate it
beat im sorry
we didnt have enough time to properly test it
the video cuts to static
abigail turns off the monitor looking to blade
god only knows what hes thinking
take a look at the plague arrow
caulder reaches for a refrigerated aluminum case snapping it open
inside resting on a bed of form fitting foam is a glass ampule thats been fitted into a stake like contraption
it looks like the head of a high tech harpoon
i only had time to fabricate a small batch of daystar
i outfitted it with a compressed gas projectile so you should be able to fire it from one of the fourbarrel rifles or a bow
beat just make sure the shot counts cause we dont have enough for a second try
abigail sits before a laptop creating another custom mp playlist
we watch as she hi lights songs with her mouse moves them over to her portable device with a few clicks
abigail unhooks her mp device slips her earbud headphones into her ears
the sounds of flukes track atom bomb fade up gradually shifting from tinny source music to soundtrack
blade and abigail suit up arming themselves
we see blade loading rounds into his pistols
abigail selecting arrows checking the range dials
blade sliding silver stakes into his bandoliers
abigail working with caulder affixing the plague capsule to one of her arrowheads
blade polishes his sword
finished he sights down the length of it takes a practice swing then secures it in his back scabbard with a flourish
we hear the rumble of two motorcycles
blade emerges from the alley astride his signature ducati st crotch rocket
abigail appears a moment later on her own customized bike
blade revs his engine
then the two bikes take off
drake sits before zoe who has been shackled to the wall his right arm encased in one of the armored gauntlets from his burial armor
the rest of the armor has been propped up on a stand nearby
do you know who i am
youre the nome king
drake smiles at this
the nome king
i like that
leaning closer tell me child
do you want to die
zoe is terrified but tries to remain defiant
im not afraid ill go to heaven
there is no heaven
no happy ending for good little girls
the only thing you have to look forward to is nothingness
as drake talks his pupils seem to widen until the darkness nearly occludes the whites of his eyes
zoe stares at him
cant tear her gaze away
his eyes are hypnotic
but what if you could change that
what if you could remain a child forever
he reaches out running a sharp fingernail over her cheek
what if you could keep this little doll like face of yours until the sun itself cooled to a cold hard rock
beat wouldnt you like that
wouldnt you accept that gift
zoe reaches out calmly touches drakes cheek
my friends are coming to kill you
grimwood punches king whose body sags weakened from the beatings he has undergone
asher and danica look on
gonna be sorry you did that nobodys coming for you king
sure they are
left a trail of digital bread crumbs excuse me
one thing you need to know about us nightstalkers
when you join our club you get this nifty little tracking node surgically implanted in your body bullshit
one of us gets lost the others just dial up the satellite and presto instant cavalry
grimwood looks to asher and danica unsure
smiling playing along okay king where did they put this tracking node of yours
he motions for her to draw closer whispering
its in my left ass cheek whack
danica slaps kings face making him see stars
alright its in my right ass cheek whack
danica slaps king again this time knocking his head the other way
he spits out blood no seriously gasping its in the meat of my butt right below my bart simpson tattoo danica punches kings mid section
he sucks air
despite his attempts at humor hes hurting now
his body sags pull down my tighty whities see for yourself
its not funny anymore
behind danica grimwood and asher both cough
king lifts his bruised face staring up at danica through blood shrouded eyes
for the first time we get a sense of his true hatred for her
no its not you horse humping bitch wincing as he breathes but it will be a few seconds from now
coughing and what happens then lover
beat see that tickle in your throat youre feeling right now
danica coughs again blinks repeatedly as if her eyes were irritated
she rubs them looks to the others
theyre feeling the effects too
and grimwoods face is smoking
thats atomized colloidal silver
danica keys into the rumble of the air conditioning system and a hissing sound beneath that
she looks up its being pumped into the buildings air conditioning system
we go macro shrinking down until we see a cloud of tiny silver particles blowing into the room
the particles are dusting the vampires being unwittingly inhaled by them and as the vampires react en mass suddenly gagging their throats and faces on fire
which means that the fat lady should be singing right about has caught the worst of it
a whole lung full
he shrieks as he coughs up blue tinged flames the flesh on his face simultaneously burning away and shatters as blade crashes down
he lands in a cat like stance then flips over into a cartwheel kicking grimwood in the face
as grimwood goes down asher and danica scatter blade tackles grimwood sending both of them over the railing into the lower level of the penthouse
alarms are ringing
asher and danica rush down the hall trying not to breathe the silver contaminated air
we see other vampires staggering from doorways coughing gagging
drake hears the alarms
he reaches for his sword which rests in a nearby stand
as he heads out he strides past zoe still chained to the wall
on the lower level blade and grimwood are going at it
flood in from multiple entry ways
its an all out melee
blade is seriously overwhelmed but the sheer number of vampires and humans is actually slowing them down
blade takes on a half dozen of them at once stunning one of the familiars using him as a human shield tossing him aside to trip up another on rushing
then he pauses instantly calculating the geography of the room the relative positions of the other combatants assessing decorations and furniture as possible weapons
his battle plan ready blade engages his enemies once again
abigail appears at the lip of the smashed in skylight
she lowers herself down on a rope rushes to kings side you alright
nothing a hot tub full of bactine wont fix
abigail hits the release switch on the high tech pillory and the cuffs around his wrists open
as abigail helps king out zoe drakes got her
abigail nods handing king her pistol
then shes out the door
seconds later king follows abigail pauses slipping her earbuds in turning on her mp player
the bumping strains of flukes absurd track kick in
abigail uncilps her uv arc telescopes it outward and suddenly its like were in a first person shooter video game
she moves through the corridors with mathematical precision feeling the music in her bones slicing through every vampire she encounters with deadly efficiency
are coming out from every doorway
abigail punches one in the solar plexus decapitates another finishes off the first
then shes moving on taking down a third fourth and fifth vampire with her rapid fire stake dispenser
throwing stakes with blinding speed
after a half dozen stakes her dispenser is empty
without missing a beat she presses a tab on the dispenser ejects the clip then reaches to her belt where a back up is secured and slaps it in place
the mayhem continues
blade unsheathes his sword
he parries two combatants with clubs then whirls around deflecting a gunshot from a third with the flat of his sword
grimwood is furious
his men are tripping all over themselves
he grabs an antique battle axe thats secured to the wall
he sees an opening swings at blades head blade drops and the axe slices through one of grimwoods own men
in an eye blink blade is up again advancing
he cuts down another familiar pushes forward cuts oown a second now blade and grimwood are face to face
grimwood swings his axe again
blade hooks his sword beneath it flipping it from grimwoods hands
blade sweeps his sword around in a wide arc cutting straight through grimwoods mid section
the upper half of grimwoods body topples away then he rights himself
a half vampire
hes still alive running forward on his hands trailing viscera
he springs up at blade all claws and gnashing teeth
blade catches grimwood by the throat whirls him around and manages to impale whats left of grimwood with his sword point
grimwood ashes in blades arms
the only thing left are his steel teeth which clatter to the floor at blades feet
abigail enters sees zoe
two vampires guards stand nearby
in a flash abigail flings two silver stakes at them
both stakes hit their mark and the vamps crumple to ash
abigail hurries over shoots apart the lock on zoes shackle
zoe wraps her arms around abigail hugging her tight
abigail takes zoe by the hand pulling her towards the door
come on hon
lets get you out of here
king stumbles out into the hallway pulling his shirt back on
as he limps down the corridor a growl makes him pause beau the vampire rottweiler lopes around the corner
then emerge behind beau
theyre all growling now
under his breath fuck
the three of them break barking like crazy snouts splitting open as their jaws flower apart
blade moves into the upper gallery of a vast atrium
stands before him waiting sword in hand
he extends it touching the tip to the floor
are you ready to die blade
been ready since the day i was born mother fucker
with a smile then allow me to accommodate you
drake does a back flip over the balcony
forty feet down
blade follows drawing his sword as he leaps and lands
now the two warriors face each other swords raised eyes locked their stances frozen
like classic samurai
whoever moves first loses
moving in on both men circling around them
slow the heart
slow the breath
find the opening
breaks first bringing his sword over in less time than it takes to blink an eye
no one could possibly deflect the blow
and yet manages a counter stroke with super human grace
he advances parries his sword clanging and singing like a blacksmiths hammer on sheet metal
cut thrust block diagonal downward slashes
the moves come faster
drake ducks barely avoiding being decapitated
blades sword cuts right through a column instead
blade locks swords with him
for a moment the two warriors are nose to nose
then blade twists his sword free cutting open drakes cheek drake growls back flipping up onto a ledge
he touches his fingertips to the cut tastes his own blood
then we hear the telltale sounds of cartilage popping
for a brief moment his facial features shift giving us yet another glimpse of his true form
as his anger increases drake begins to devolve
he dives at blade howling raking his claws at blades face
he strikes out knocking blade across the atrium
he springs forward dragging blade up by his throat sinking his fangs into blades shoulder
blide screams and we as king runs
he hazards a look back
the vampire dogs are quickly gaining on him
its a dead end
just plate glass windows and a whole lot of nothing beyond
the dogs are almost on king when suddenly king jumps snagging an overhead pipe
as he swings his body upward skid on the floor unable to stop their momentum and crash straight through the plate glass window
an explosion of glass as two of the vampire rottweilers tumble into the night
they fall like stones twenty stories down into the traffic clogged intersection below
king drops back to the floor cackling pleased with himself
it takes him a second to realize that didnt take a swan dive out the window
hes right behind king
and now hes springing forward wham
king is hit in the chest by the snarling beast
he drops the pistol as hes knocked back onto the floor
the dog lunges again with one arm king struggles to keep his face from being bit off while searching blindly for the discarded pistol
king locates it firing into the beasts chest ashes disintegrating all over kings face
king gets a mouthful of the charcoal remains tries to spit them out
making a face bad dog
abigail emerges onto the gallery with zoe
she spots an alcove indicates that zoe should hide
then she slips a silver stake into zoes hand
just in case
abigail rushes to the handrail looking down at blade and drake
her view is obscured
she cant get a good shot
drake digs his fangs into blades shoulder
blade struggles manages to slip a stake from his bandolier wham
blade slams the stake into drakes ear canal
the beast shrieks in pain dropping blade
but all the gambit has done is drive drake into a berserker rage
drake swings his fist
drakes fist goes through the wall puncturing a steam pipe
steam vents drake reaches in rips an eight foot section of the pipe from the wall bringing a sparking nest of electrical cables along with it
he swings the pipe section around whacking blade
drake swings the makeshift club again
hes a one man demolition crew decimating everything in his path
hes smashing holes in the floor the walls plowing through partitions of glass and steel
abigail moves down the gallery looks up span the length of the atrium ceiling
abigail balances on the handrail then jumps out into space catching hold of one of the crosspieces
like an acrobat she monkey swings her way beneath the gantry
if she loses her grip shell fall more than fifty feet
a bullet strikes just in front of abigail showering her with sparks
more bullets follow
firing from below trying to pick her off
suddenly uv bullets strike each of the vampires
as they ash we having dragged his battered body out onto the upper gallery
hes playing guardian angel to abigail laying down cover fire so she can continue
but then appears behind king
she tackles him wrestling him to the floor pummeling his face with her fist
king tries to ward of f the blows but hes sorely outmatched
he swings his electronic pistol up danica twists it from his grip ejecting the clip from the stock
kings sun dog bullets spill out all over the floor
she tosses the gun aside reaches for king again back to abigail
shes breathing heavily trying to call up new reserves of strength
she glances down big mistake
she forces herself to look back up
she swings herself pendulum style manages to snag yet another crosspiece
a down below armed with a rifle
he fires again grazing abigails shoulder with the bullet
abigail cries out nearly losing her grip
king rolls on his side spits out a bloody tooth
no offense danica gasping in pain but ive wanted to kill you since the moment we slept together
i was that bad huh
king reaches a palsied hand for his discarded pistol points it vaguely in danicas direction
no bullets in your gun king
yeah but heres the beauty wiping his bloody mouth these babies can be triggered remotely
king pulls the trigger
the scattered sun dog bullets erupt with uv light
danica shrieks trying to shield her already burning face from the glare
she runs horribly wounded
drake pummels blade flinging his body about like a ragdoll
he grabs blade by his ankle swings him upwards some thirty feet smash
blade collides with the underside of a massive hanging glass chandelier lighting fixture
blade falls back to the ground stunned dropping his sword
drake pounces on him
blade can barely fend off drakes blows anymore
in desperation he digs his fingers into drakes eyes
drake swings both fists downward hulk style shattering an entire section of the limestone flooring
a shock wave ripples out from the point of impact sending waves of two foot stone tiles flipping up into the air knocking blade off his feet
king loads a sun dog into his pistol steadies his aim on the railing and fires at asher screams across the atrium striking dead center in ashers open mouth
the bullet explodes
uv light causes ashers skull to burn up from the inside out
his headless corpse falls forward over the gallery railing
then it too carbonizes and burns up
relieved king sinks to his knees
we see zoe slip from the alcove
she makes for the stairs
king has bought abigail more time
she swings her body forward hooking her legs over the next crosspiece
then she lets go with her hands
now she is hanging upside down secured only by the tension in her calves
abigail reaches behind her removes her bow
blood from her wounded shoulder drips down over her collar bone reaching her cheek briefly obscuring her vision
she wipes it away
then she reaches back once more and because her quiver is pointed downward a number of arrows slide out
abigail panics twisting her body managing to lust barely snag the la ue arrow as it tumbles past her
abigail shuts her eyes trying to find her center
with her eyes closed she nocks the arrow and draws the bow back
then she opens her eyes
shes only going to get one shot and shes going to have to take it while hanging upside down
a abigails pov a on drake and blade below locked in combat
she tracks their progress waits for drake to move into a better position drake shoulders a support column snapping it in two
an entire section of the gallery walkway above comes crashing down burying blade in debris but its not enough for drake
he leaps forward fishing blade out hauling him up drake head butts blade once twice
blades eyes roll to whites
drake looks down sees blades discarded sword
drake scoops it up strikes at blade blade manages to roll to the side avoiding the blow
drake strikes again dealing blade a glancing blow on abigail
more blood has trickled down her neck into her eyes
but she cant wipe them anymore
shes already got her bow drawn
shes committed to the shot
we can hear abigails heartbeat as she settles
she takes a final breath holds it and lets the plague arrow fly
as it streaks downward hurtling towards drake at more than feet per second
then at the last possible instant chingg
drake deflects the arrow with his sword
it harmlessly falls to the floor rolling a few yards away
stunned her expression melting into despair
swinging blades sword around
plunging it into blades side
as he pulls it back out again gasps sinking downward
hes on his knees now in shock
drake roars again shifting conjuring up seventy centuries of violence and predation
and the nightmare shape that was only hinted at before finally takes center stage
blood suffuses drakes flesh turning his skin crimson
his canines elongate his lower jaw distends
jagged bone spurs erupt all over his body like hes growing a suit of razor sharp thorns
he doesnt need a sword anymore
hes become a living weapon
drake is gone
now he is drake swings the sword overhead
hes going to decapitate blade
and just as the sword reaches the top of its arc emerges from the shadows behind drake clutching a silver stake
she shoves it into drakes back pushing with all the strength her little body can muster
the blow wasnt lethal but it hurt all the same
he turns on zoe enraged his attention distracted for one crucial second summoning the last of his reserves
he pitches his body forward managing to snag the end of the plague arrow
and before drake even realizes what is happening wham
blade sinks the plague arrow deep into drakes chest
drake drops the sword turning back to face blade exhausted beyond measure blade sags
as the arrowhead dispense the bio weapon
we see the virus flooding drakes internal organs causing them to blacken as his circulatory system carries it throughout his body
letting loose an inhuman scream vomiting up a spray of blood mist
his monstrous features begin to melt reshaping into his more familiar face
at the same time we shrinking until we are amidst the spray of blood drake expelled
we continue shrinking until we are moving with the individual molecules of drakes breath as the plague virions latch onto them causing them to blacken and become necrotic
moving with the twirling molecules until they are inhaled by having retreated from her defeat by king
she clutches her throat
we can see the virus infiltrating her system as tiny black threads expand across her face
she sways falling onto the floor
she reaches a beseeching hand towards king then dies a final still born curse on her lips
are feeling the effects now too
one by one they drop choking going into convulsions
as they writhe on the floor we watch the daystar virus ravaging their bodies
drake slumps against the wall
hero and villain are now separated by only a few feet
both at deaths door
well done hunter
blade stares back
at this point hes just trying to remain conscious
hes lost a ton of blood
you fought with honor drake shudders his breathing becoming increasingly shallow
as i knew you would
the humans are coming for you you know
in their eyes you and i are the same
allow me one last indulgence then gasping a parting gift drake grows still his eyes locked on blades
rush to blades side
zoe joins them
blade is dying fading fast
abigail shakes blade blade
her voice sounds distant and muted overridden by blades own heartbeat which is fading up dominating the soundtrack
blades eyes cant focus anymore
theyre clouding over
we drop away from abigail and king like were falling down a dark tunnel
then the world fades to white
fade in from white
we see the sky the burning orb of the rising sun
a trio of fbi helicopters ride out from the dawn swooping down over the stirring city
it didnt take long for the authorities to arrive
cumberland sits in the front passenger seat hale behind him
as the helicopters touch down in the plaza we see a small convoy of police and fbi vehicles converging around them
cumberland and hale are among the first out
they rush towards the phoenix towers entrance guns drawn dozens of agents and officers behind them
the first rays of sun penetrate through the atrium windows setting the scattered vampire corpses ablaze
danica asher and the others all ignite
when they got there all of drakes people were dead
by the time cumberland and his men have entered fanning out through the atrium all they find are a series of corpse shaped piles of ash and singe marks
in the weeks that followed the rest of the worlds vampires also perished
beat wed finally won
surveying the scene frustrated by what hes found
then we hear shouts coming from the back of the atrium
they find blade
hes dead slumped against a wall
theres no sign of drake
the vampire king is gone
close on blades face his body being wheeled on an autopsy gurney
pull back to reveal that we are in an fbi morgue
cumberland and hale stand nearby overseeing everything as lift blades body onto an autopsy table
they turn on a bank of overhead uv lights
the lead examiner reaches for a scalpel
but as he touches the scalpel to blades chest and blade
cumberland and hale finally got their body changes
we hear a series of pops and cracks as subdermal cartilage begins to loosen and shift
at the same time the skin begins to lighten as melanin is gradually leached away
but it wasnt the one they were banking on
as they react with varying degrees of shock
we realize that its not blade lying before them
somehow even in death the vampire king managed to take blades shape and temporarily retain it
the virus didnt kill blade
but the authorities very well could have
so in the end realizing that own his people were doomed drake decided to give blade a gift
beat abigail cont aad by taking blades shape he bought blade enough time to escape
offering blade a second chance at life a bright summer day
blade stands at the edge of a cliff looking out over a sun struck ocean
for the first time since weve seen him hes not wearing armor or sunglasses or handguns or rifles
and were it not for the sword he holds we might even mistake him for an ordinary man
and so blade took it
blade flings his sword over the cliff into the ocean below
we never saw him again
we see the sword sinking reflecting the refracted sunlight from above as it twirls end over end
at peace with himself at last
after a moments reflection he turns and walks away
he disappeared completely
beat but thats what heroes do
they simply fade out
and in this way as blade moves further and further away from us dwindling into the horizon until he disappears entirely
they become legends
over darkness we hear the sound of traffic
we are moving towards a local punk dive wedged into a crowded block in the meat packing district
a doorman lucius stands outside checking customers ids
we hear hillbilly thrash music coming from within
king holds his four barreled rifle
abigail peels away disappearing into an alley as king nears the front door
the doorman recognizes king knows hes trouble
king what the hell are you doing here
just a little sport hunting
a band belts out a cover of sam and the shams little red riding hood
the band members look a little lupine
as king weaves his way through the crowd lucius hurries alongside
aint no vampires left king
so who do you have to hunt
thats an interesting question my friend
and ive got a question for you in return
as king pushes his way through to the bathrooms we hear an unearthly roar coming from the mens room
what do you get when you cross a vampire with a werewolf
the door to the mens room explodes open
abigail comes flying out
she hits the far wall of the hallway slides to th floor
but shes up in an instant pulling a knife on raising his four barrel a fur coat that sticks to your neck
wearing a blood soaked stray cats style suit
the ephedrine nightmare creature looks at king opening his elongated snout to flash a set of razor sharp canid teeth
dont you know fur is murder
