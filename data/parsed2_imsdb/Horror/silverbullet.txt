b if window
href b b silver bullet by stephen king based on his story cycle of the werewolf it nearly fills the screen swimming mysteriously in the warm late summer air
a rail rider comes chugging along the tracks
aboard is arnie westrum a big man in a strappy t shirt and chino pants
he is drinking beer
arnie sings my beer is rheingold the dry beer
think of rheingold whenever you buy beer
he drains the rest of his own bottle of rheingold and tosses it to one side
up ahead we see a switching point
arnie throws the rail rider into neutral opens the toolbox on the back and brings out a big five cell flashlight
he shines it on the switch
he gets a crowbar from the toolbox plus a big wrench a pair of pliers a hammer and a pair of work gloves
he also gets another bottle of beer and sticks it into his back pocket
arnie jumps down and approaches the switch
he drops his tools pulls on his work gloves and trains the light on the switch for a moment
during this arnie sings its not bitter not sweet its a real frosty treat wont you try wont you buy rheingold beer
he tries the switch
stuck tightern dogshit in a deep freeze
he takes the bottle of beer from his back pocket and fishes a churchkey from one of the front ones
he pops the cap and drinks deeply
then he screws the half empty bottle of beer into the cinders so it wont fall over
then he picks up his crowbar
theres a sound of bushes shaking
something comes out something huge
it leaps limberly onto the rail rider
it is a werewolf with greenish yellow eyes
tatters of clothes still hang from it
what kind of monster exactly
it is humanoid as well as wolfish
and when we learn who it is in its human form we should be able to spot the resemblance at once
and kick ourselves for not knowing earlier
it crouches there huge and bushy and fanged and deadly on the whole rail rider
hes working the crowbar into the junction point just as hard as he can
swearing at it under his breath
suddenly both the tracks and the switch move
a little oil
he turns back toward the rail rider
its not bitter not sweet
its a big fuckin treat
a noise bushes rattling cinders clinking and rattling
arnie looks around
his bottle of beer stands by the litter of his tools
hes rooting around in the toolbox back to the switching point
a hairy hand paw closes around it we see huge curved claws on that hand
glaring green yellow eyes a savage beastial face which is still half human
thats all we see
the rest is in shadow
it opens its mouth and upends the bottle of beer
foamy rheingold begins gurgling down the werewolfs throat
he comes up with an old fashioned oilcan the kind with the long spout
he starts back to the switching point waving the can
arnie sings my beer is rheingold the dry beer
think of rheingold whenever you fry beer
he arrives looks down
and stops singing
his eyes widen
we can see the hole where arnie put his beer but it is of course empty
beside it are two huge prints in the cinders half wolf half human
hes beginning to be afraid
beginning to look around to see what might be out here with him
beginning to realize he is in extremely deep shit
it rises up on its hind legs eyes glaring an ugly yellow green
its snout wrinkles back revealing those teeth
hes craning back to look at the thing his face a grue of horror
oh n a huge clawed hand paw comes sweeping down
arnies head is granted an immediate reno style divorce from the rest of his body
sound of the beast approaching
a hairy arm and taloned hand reaches into the toolbox bolted to the back and rummages
the hand is dripping blood
it comes up with a bottle of rheingold
the werewolf begins to sing
it is a bizarre funny horrible grunting the words hellishly recognizable
werewolf gutteral subhuman my beer is rheingold the dry beer
no bottle opener for this thing it brings the neck of the bottle down sharply on the edge of the toolbox
beer foams out
he it rams the jagged neck of the bottle deep into its mouth and drinks
foam drizzles down its pelt
werewolf snarling voice think of rheingold whenever you buy beer
the bottle is empty
there are crunching sounds as it begins to eat the bottle
blood begins to run out of its mouth its face wrinkles in pain and fury
it spits out broken bloody jags of glass
were looking at main street of a small country town might be new england might be mid south
might be might be
this is tarkers mills and in places like this time moves more slowly
cars not too many move back and forth
no one is in a hurry
we see the methodist church and the parsonage next door andys sporting goods owens pub with its narragansett neon sign
we see a barber shop with a striped pole we see the holy family catholic church and the rectory next door
we see the gem theater which is showing a revival of sophia loren in two women
its our town u
jane voice over this place is tarkers mills where i grew up
and this is how it was when i was fourteen a place where people cared about each other as much as they cared about themselves
this is how my town looked as all unknowing it approached the rim of the nightmare
the killing had begun
sound the howl of the werewolf distant a bit dreamy
virgil cutts owner of virgils texaco is filling up a car
we hear the howl
and virgil looks up uneasily
in the barber shop billy mcclaren the barber is just taking the apron off the methodist minister rev
they both look around
folks are coming out of the gem theater
they pause at the sound of that howl and look toward the edge of town
as jane speaks we see the moon sink below the horizon
jane v o the killing had begun but at first no one knew it
arnie westrum was a chronic drunk and what happened seemed like an accident
slowly the view improves grows lighter as we time lapse to sound a train is approaching
we hear its horn
camera moves in
here is a shattered rheingold bottle
there is a litter of arnies tools
and here on the cheek of arnies severed head a few ants are checking things out
sound the trains horn much closer
jane v o the county coroner concluded that arnie passed out on the tracks
there wasnt enough evidence to conclude anything else
and suddenly the train comes smashing into the frame horn blaring
the rail rider goes flying
arnies body disappears underneath
we see something flopping and moving under there
it could be a bundle of rags
the common is more or less in the center of town either surrounded by main street commerce or backed by it
the camera moves slowly in on a big tent thats been erected on the common looks like a revival meeting tent almost but the banner draped over the entrance reads
support the behind or to the side on the grass picnic tables have been set out end to end
women are putting salads and home baked breads on these just about the whole town is going to sit down to a meal when the meetings over
further off men are tending barbecues roasting corn etc
joe haller amplified voice id like to give you father lester lowe of holy family catholic church
enthusiastic applause greets this
most of the town is here seated on folding chairs
were looking particularly at three people nan coslaw her husband bob and their fourteen year old daughter jane
it is jane a slightly older jane who we have heard speaking
she is now a bit bored with the meeting which has been going on for some time
as the applause continues she leans toward her mother
im going out for a while kay
and make sure your brothers all right
as jane gets up the applause starts to fade a bit
note jane is wearing a silver crucifix and will continue to wear it through the whole movie
to one side is a big black and white photograph on an easel
it shows a van which has been customized into an emergency medical unit
behind the podium are four chairs
tom obanion sits in one of them
andy fairton sits in another red faced and beaming
joe haller the town constable is just returning to his lester lowe is just approaching the mike as the applause dies
lowes face shines with love and goodwill
for the last ten years
he taps the mike
she is making her way down the row to the aisle the people should be seated in folding chairs
she passes a girl of about her own age who has overheard nans parting shot
girl mocking make sure your brothers all right
jane low martys a booger
she reaches the aisle and starts out
he taps the mike again
bob good natured just pretend youre in your own church askin for money father
itll work fine
good natured laughter greets this
a bit flustered he taps the mike and is rewarded by a brief for the last ten years i have had a dream
a dream of a time when modern medical care would come to this small community which sometimes seems so far from durham with her lifesaving hospitals
i hope that this meeting at which i see so many of my friends gathered will be the start of making my dream come true
sound enthusiastic applause
its a blacksnake
harmless but big
it goes wriggling through the grass toward a stream
in the b
sound of marty voice holy
brady are you sure theyre not poisonous
brady voice little old blacksnake
hands the rather grimy hands of a boy bent on mischief grab the blacksnake
brady holds the snake up
both boys gaze at it with respectful wonder
note marty is wearing a silver st
cristophers medallion and will through the whole movie
lemme hold him
brady hands it over
as marty looks at the snake brady sees jane v o i was almost fifteen that summer
my brother marty was eleven
marty and his friend brady kincaid were the crosses i had to bear
brady was actually the worse of the two but i was rarely disposed to see that
not when my younger brother was so constantly thrown in my face by my parents
lowe v o from the tent is a lot of money
but when you think of the lives this unit might save it seems very inexpensive indeed
applause greets this
again we are fairly tight on the boys we see them from waist or chest height
brady snatches back the snake
i got an idea
brady looks toward jane
marty follows his gaze
his eyes widen
marty assesses the grin
an endeavor like this seems to me to be the very definition of community all of us pulling together as one farmers and merchants
protestants and catholics
she is walking slowly toward the picnic area and is passing under a tree
theres more applause from the tent
brady teasing voice jane
she looks up
the blacksnake dangles down toward her almost touching her upturned face
jane shrieks and bolts
she gets a little way trips over her own feet and falls down hard
shes wearing what was a nice jumper and nylons
now the jumper is torn and the hose shredded at the knees
hes lying over a limb with the snake in his hand laughing wildly
she gets up looks at her clothes her bloody knees
shes near tears
the shots from the chest up
he looks sorry he was a part of this little stunt as he ought to be
it was just a blacksnake jane she looks around at him in a fury of embarrassment and something very close to hate
look at my knees
look at my dress
i hate you
did wittle janie make wee wee in her teddies
stop it brady
he throws the snake
she dodges the snake with a little scream
shes beginning to cry but she flips brady the bird just the same
he moves toward jane there is something queerly unnatural in this movement and in a moment well understand but for the time being we must be puzzled
jane im sorry
it was just a joke
we didnt mean hes reached her
jane is sobbing now hysterical
you never mean to
i hate you you booger
she runs away
he swings down and comes over to marty
brady with satisfaction really got her goat that time
hes in a wheelchair looking glumly after jane
oh shut up brady
shes walking slowly along still crying a little
now she steps behind some bushes looks around hikes up the skirt of her jumper and wriggles out of the wrecked panty hose
stella randolph voice wait
startled jane looks around instinctively yanking her dress down
no one in sight
man voice rough just leave me alone
now she looks toward a man who looks like he might be a traveling salesman who has just stepped whole and breathing from a dirty joke about the farmers daughter
comes striding down from the bandstand
stella randolph a plump but sweetly pretty girl comes to the stairs but does not descend them
she is also crying but these are real tears folks
stella is a human niagara falls
stella calls please
you have to help me
deceiver keeps walking its your oven but it aint my bun youre baking in there
sounds more applause
we can hear stella sobbing as jane walks slowly toward the bandstand with her panty hose still balled up in one hand
jane looks suddenly aware that shes not the only one in this sad world who has troubles
she reaches the foot of the stairs going up to the bandstand and tosses the hose absently in a litter can
jane mounts the steps timidly
is that you
stella has retreated to one of the benches where she is bawling into a handful of kleenex
pudgy and twenty two she is both funny and terribly sad
she looks around at the sound of janes voice
stella alarmed who
jane approaching closer its jane stella
stella sees it is and turns away from her still weeping
jane stands uncertain what to do next
after a moment she approaches closer and touches stellas turned back timidly
jane tenderly whats wrong
stella weeping hes going away
i know he is
whos going away
stella turns to her weeping still and distracted
what am i going to tell my mother
if he wont marry me what am i going to tell my mother
jane bewildered stella i dont know what oh leave me alone
just leave me alone you stupid thing
stella lumbers across the bandstand and down the steps
jane stares after her bewildered and perhaps even a little frightened
let us pray
most of them bow their heads
may the grace of god shine upon those gathered here
and lift them up
and grant success to the endeavor to which they have so openheartedly declared their support
they raise their heads
some echo the amen
others cross themselves
people are coming out and getting ready to chow down
traveling along a country road
bob and nan coslaw are sitting up front
marty and jane are in the backseat
jane is as far from marty as she can get
shes still mad as hell
band aids crisscross her knees
martys wheelchair is collapsed in the cargo area of the wagon
nan turns around to look at the kids and its really jane shes mad at
i want you two to bury the hatchet
youre being very silly jane
jane hot did you see my knees
jane i i think youre being mean as well as silly
your brother has never had a scraped knee in his whole life
well here it is the chief source of janes animus against her brother and the source of most of the tension in the coslaw family
marty winces and turns away a little embarrassed this always happens
he doesnt like it but he doesnt know how to make his parents his mother in particular quit it
you always take his side because hes a cripple
well its not my fault that hes a cripple
come on jane it was bradys idea
i couldnt stop him
bradys a booger and so are you
bob roars stop it or ill throw the whole bunch of you out
in this traditional family unit bob is the voice of authority
they all heed although the atmosphere remains thundery
train tracks run near the road
bob points thats where poor old arnie westrum pitched his last drunk
he crosses himself and they all look toward they had to pick up what was left of him in a peach basket
did he really get his head cut off dad
thats what brady said
if you dont stop it im going to vomit
i mean it
nan no sympathy youre not going to vomit jane
and i think weve all had quite enough of this horror movie talk
craning back to look at the spot where arnie bit the dust
his face is thoughtful solemn
jane is lying in bed her face to the wall
dim light falls on her unhappy face as the door is opened
marty v o janey
are you awake
jane says nothing
he is in his house wheelchair not the silver bullet he was in the bullet during the common scene but we didnt get a very good look at it
he has some stuff on his lap
a box for sure
can i come in
her eyes are open but she says nothing
just looks at the wall
he rolls across to her bed and puts something on her night table
sound of change and a rattle of paper
she rolls over and sees hes put about three bucks on the table
plus a can of mixed nuts
whats the money for
a new pair of panty hose
is it enough
i dont want your money
youre a booger
it was bradys idea jane
honest to god
please take the money
i want to make up
she looks at him and sees hes sincere honestly contrite
theres hope for these two kids yet maybe
i can get a pair of leggs down at the pharmacy for a dollar forty nine
she pushes the rest back to him then looks at the can
she picks it up curious
thats for you too
uncle al gave it to me jane scorn that drunk
but i want you to have it
he gives her a warm melting smile
when your little brother is being good to you its time to watch out but jane has been lulled
she starts to open it then looks questioningly at him
yeah go ahead
she opens it
a long paper snake the kind with a spring inside it leaps out
marty backs up the wheelchair so hes out of her reach
marty grinning it really is for your birthday though try it on brady
hell wet his pants
go to hell
marty smiling i love you janey
she tries to be angry with him
and cannot this is a response well find that both marty and his uncle al evoke
she smiles at him a little
he reverses his wheelchair also smiling a little and leaves
were looking down at a brave little nestle of lights
theres one light on upstairs and another downstairs
also downstairs is the bluish flicker of tv light
an ivy trellis climbs one side of the house
sounds canned laughter tv dialogue
stellas mother asleep in front of the tv
a whole bunch of capsules are dumped into it
the camera draws back to show us stella sitting by her vanity mirror
the rest of the room is reflected in the mirror including the window we are upstairs
note it would be nice to see that fat moon floating in the window
theres a framed picture of stellas ex boyfriend on the vanity beside the dish of pills
stella sets down the empty prescription bottle the pills came from beside this picture
we can clearly read the word nembutol on it
there is also a large glass of water on the vanity table
stella turns the picture facedown
she might be crying but probably shes not
she takes about five of the pills starts to lift them to her mouth a howl outside
stella looks around for a moment then takes the pills with some water
she pauses looking at herself
suicides go to hell
especially if theyre pregnant
and i dont even care
she takes another five pills
and another five
sounds rattling foliage
claw hands are seizing it and climbing
sounds of hoarse guttural breathing
she takes another handful of pills
and the window behind her shatters inward
there is a bellowing roar as the werewolf throws itself through
she sits up startled awake
from upstairs another shattering roar
followed by a she runs
and a huge claw hand rips through the back of her nightgown
oh my dear god
she runs for the doorway and the hall
from upstairs comes a confusion of sounds roars breaking furniture shattering glass
one of those deadly claw hands sweeps down the bed ripping through the sheets
the spring itself
hairy muddy feet with protruding talons leap onto it
the werewolf leaps out its graceful savage animal
shes found an ancient pistol somewhere and is lugging it gamely along
she reaches the closed door of stellas room vacillates there for a moment
and then pushes it open and goes in
a long beat of silence as we hold on the door
she shrieks again
its a total shambles blood is splattered everywhere the mirror is broken the picture of dan the gay deceiver is broken the bed is torn in two
there are big muddy wolfprints on the remnants of the bed
stella lies propped in the corner with nembutols all around her
suicide may have been what she planned but it sure isnt what happened
peltzer puts out his paper rack just the press herald this morning
he looks shocked and grim
the scare headline brutal murder rocks western maine
we can see stellas photograph
through the window of robertsons luncheonette we see the proprietor bobby robertson talking earnestly with a bunch of men
among them milt sturmfuller alfie knopfler virgil cutts billy mcclaren and elmer zinneman a farmer well meet later
at andys sporting goods andy fairton is putting a big hand lettered sign in the window
it reads remington d
at the methodist parsonage a dodge pulls slowly out and mother randolph gets out weeping
as she approaches the parsonage door lester lowe comes out and embraces her
the sign reads tarkers mills town office
neatly lettered on the panel tarkers mills constabulary
and below this joseph haller
joe haller voice okay
oh fuck off
haller slams the phone down with an angry bang
he looks like a guy who has been up all night
pete his pudgy deputy looks like a high school athlete who has suddenly found himself batting in the world series
whatd they say joe
they said theyd be here by noon
pete nervous maybe it wasnt such a good idea telling that smokey bear from the detective division to fuck off joe
haller morosely i waited until he hung up
jesus what a mess
i wish id stayed in the army
lets go on out there
he gets slowly up
its a comfortable red brick building on a side street
ivy climbs up the sides
two or three rows of bikes stand along one side of the building
sound the bell rings
a beat or two then the doors bang wide and a billion kids spill out
its the end of the first day of school and they are excited
they range from grade to grade
most kids book it for home as fast as they can getting on their bikes and riding or just running
everyone has a pink report card
brady and tammy are riding bikes
now there is the sound of a gasoline engine and marty catches up
hes got the silver bullets motor running for the first time in the movie
later on it will sound extremely powerful like a racing car but now it just sounds like a big lawnmower engine with a muffler on it
its pretty cool though a bright metallic silver with flame decals on the motor housing
looks sort of like something big daddy roth might have thought up
on the back is a license plate which says silver look out
its madman marty and the silver bullet
you glad to be back in jail marty
sure i like school
thats what my sister says too
pretty soon im going to start checking the mirror to see if im turning green
i gotta split see ya marty
tammy and marty watch as brady zooms off toward home on his bike
marty pushes in a hand clutch and moves a small lever
he bumps down over the curb and they cross the street side by side tammy on her bike marty in his wheelchair
he pops up over the curbing with a bounce
he shoves in the little hand clutch and revs the engine
not bad huh
my uncle al took off the regular muffler and put on a cherry bomb
he said hed come over sometime this summer and wed soup up the engine
but now i dunno
hes getting a divorce and hes in the doghouse with my mother
for getting a divorce
it is his third
the other kids are gone they are alone
the sidewalk has ended and they roll slowly along the dirt verge of the road
they look toward the driveway is blocked off with a sawhorse bearing the stenciled words police investigation
the yard is filled with cop cars hallers constable car plus a number of state police vehicles
uniformed men come and go
we can see a large black wreath on the door
thanks for coming with me marty i was scared to go past her house by myself
marty matter of fact yeah
it is a little scary
i mean i saw her
all the time
tammy stops her bike
shes on the verge of tears
i used to see her every day and she never knew what was going to happen to her and neither did i
i mean i know how stupid that sounds but
hey take it easy
i know how you feel
he gets the silver bullet moving again and she has to pedal along to catch up
they stop at the end
theres something else scary
tammy points that
it stands a bit behind the house itself
a creepy place
many of the glass panes are broken some of these not many have been blocked with cardboard
the inside is a jungle of plants that have run to riot
in the f
is a mucky looking garden patch where nothing much is growing
she is quite deeply troubled
ive been hearing noises in there
what kind of noises
and my dad says its kids
but its not rats and its not kids
its oh my suds and body here is the great american alcoholic for sure the rural version
milt is wearing a suit of pee stained thermal underwear
hes wearing a baseball cap with the word caterpillar on the front and has a bottle of beer in one hand im pretty sure that his beer is rheingold the
with his other hand he is busily scratching his crotch
tammy you get on in here and do some dishes
tammy voice ive got to go
id go out and take a look myself but i think the bulletd get stuck in the garden
it looks sorta greasy
she smiles at him bends over and kisses him on the mouth
marty is stunned
you would wouldnt you
marty joe cool sure
well its probably nothing
im just spooked since
but if you hear any more noises tell your father
have you got enough gas to get home marty
marty startled jeez
theres a gas gauge here and the needle is almost on e
im always doing this
i gotta go tammy
milt voice tammy calls coming daddy
to marty bye
thanks again for coming home with me
she waves and goes biking down the driveway as marty motors back onto the street and turns toward town
she brings her bike to a stop by her father
why you want to hang around that cripple
i like him
goddamn cripples always end up on welfare
ought to electrocute all of em
balance the fucking budget
having delivered this pearl of wisdom milt goes inside now scratching his ass
tammy pauses a moment and looks toward the camera her face troubled and scared
hes buzzing along toward downtown which is still some distance away but at least hes made it back to the sidewalk again
marty prayerfully come on baby he looks down at now the needle is lying all the way over on e
marty pulls in
the wheelchair motor starts to pop and lug and misfire
the chair makes it to the first pump on the island closest to the street and then stalls as virgil cutts comes over
i see you lucked out again
would you fill it up please mr
want me to check the oil
wipe the windshield an check the drivers bullshit level
marty laughs virgil starts carefully pumping gas into the silver bullets small tank
overhead is the moon three days past the full
uncle al voice ill see your carlton fiske and raise you a george brett
a dave kingman
and a rod carew
shes wiping her hands with a dishtowel and looks like she just bit into a lemon
uncle al is the familys sheep of a darker color
hes thirty good looking raffish
hes also drunk
hes got both whiskey and beer
an ashtray beside him overflows with butts
he and marty are playing draw poker for martys baseball cards
each has a pile in front of him
marty really loves uncle al
his eyes just glow when he looks at him
he tosses in three baseball cards
wait a minute wait a minute
he grabs one of martys cards looks at it and tosses it back
you cant bet a manager
stone the crows
piss on him
piss on all the red sox
he swallows whiskey and chases it with beer
nan comes briskly over
shes seen and heard enough
she favors uncle al with a glare and then looks protectively at come on marty bedtime
she starts to wheel him away
let the boy finish the game nan
he means it drunk or not
she reluctantly rolls marty back to the table
make it quick
uncle al lays down his hand
marty delighted i got a straight to the queen
nan outraged thats enough
marty as his mother wheels him away aww mom
marty is sitting in a stair chair that rises slowly to the second floor
he looks dejected and glum
sound of nan hectoring her brother al
i dont think we can make out all of whats going on but weve all known women like nan and i think we can fill in the blanks
you come here drunk and expect
cant even bother to call ahead
a wheelchair stands on the second floor landing
this one is no silver bullet only the more humble sort that moves by arm power
when the stair chair clicks to a stop marty hoists himself from it into the wheelchair and rolls down the hall toward the bathroom
below nans rant is still going on
uncle al is clearing up in a kind of drunken stupor and i mean he is really drunk
hes smoking one cigarette another is smoldering away in the heaping ashtray
he drops a pile of baseball cards on the floor and bonks his head on the table bending down to pick them up
i dont want you drinking around marty
thats too much
if you cant stop it you better stay away
al straightens up
there is a sort of command force in this man and here he is partly able to rise above his abysmal drunkenness so we can see it
i come here because marty needs a friend
youve always been that to him
but if you cant leave your booze in whatever dump you call home you better just stay away
she leaves the room almost crying
uncle al looks after her and then his attention is drawn to the smoldering ashtray
he pours beer over the mess putting out the fire but creating something that looks even worse
he begins drunkenly picking up again
uncle al to himself another wonderful time at sister nans house
marty now in pjs is brushing his teeth
jane comes in shes wearing a nightie
mom was really mad at him this time wasnt she
what do you expect when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed
he lunges at her but jane steps back easily
marty overbalances and falls out of the wheelchair
his toothbrush clatters across the tile
bob coslaw sleepy voice hey
that you marty
hes okay dad
she looks around swiftly then bends down
one of martys cheeks is pressed against the floor
his eyes are shut
jane low marty are you all right
let me help you up
nan voice marty
sound of her climbing the stairs
jane throws a quick look back over her shoulder and then helps marty up in his chair
he helps by pulling on the sink counter
jane has time to give marty one quick look please dont tell on me it says
nan comes in
jane have you been teasing your brother again
she wasnt mom i dropped my toothbrush and fell over when i tried to get it
jane helped pick me up
he bats his eyes at her
marty syrupy voice janes wunnnderful
jane picks up his toothbrush
jane hands it to him here
brush them good marty
some of that shit in your head might leak down into your mouth and poison you
but jane stalks off
marty is grinning
it was a good put down
we can see the moon in the sky beyond the ruined greenhouse
the camera moves slowly toward the greenhouse
we begin to pick up sounds rattling
and low animal grunts
shes deeply asleep
big time wrestling on the tv
sound of a refrigerator door closing
milt sturmfuller comes into the living room from the kitchen
hes wearing his long johns with the designer pee stains and has a quart bottle of rheingold the dry beer in each hand
he sits down looking at the tv
milt drunk give him the airplane
wring his neck
there is a beat of silence and then something one of those earthen plant pots i think falls over and he looks up briefly hes heard something but the crowd
on the tv is loud and the match is reaching its climax
milt all eyes again give him the sleeper you fuckin bugwit
a low snarl
plants shake and shiver
another crash louder
looks toward the window
he gets up goes over and looks out
sound of another crash
he takes a shotgun from the wall breaks it and looks inside
lets see if you want to come back and break my pots all to shit after i put some rock salt in your asses
the door at the end screeches open and milt still holding the shotgun at port arms comes cautiously in
this place is really overgrown
milt advances slowly into the jungle of plants and the director will shoot it as he likes to build the suspense
im sure that plants brush his face and a bug or two maybe even a big plump spider will land on him
he hears a scuttering sound and whirls
milt shouts whos there
a mouse goes running across the warped boards which have pulled apart from each other showing deep cracks between
he relaxes and starts forward again
we keep expecting it to happen but it keeps not happening
then as milt is starting back toward the door two big hairy arms come up through the floor bursting through two of those cracks and shoving the splintered boards upward
and grab milts legs at the knees
milt screams and triggers off the shotgun unfortunately it is pointing straight up
glass showers down on him
he is pulled down into the shattered hole now we can see him only from the knees up
she sits up in bed
sounds of roars and milt screaming from the greenhouse
sturmfuller in a nightgown with her hair done up in rollers comes into tammys room
tammy wheres your father
sound another scream from the greenhouse
hes now waist deep in the hole in the floor surrounded by broken splintered boards
he is abruptly jerked downward again
he is being eaten from the feet up
as hes jerked down one of the leaning splintered boards rams into his chest
milt collapses over it like an old roman collapsing on his sword
a hairy arm reaches up and grabs his neck
milt is jerked all the way into the hole board and all
sounds of snarls growls grunts
they are hugging each other terrified by the window
the police cars are now here
theres also a meat wagon
as we watch a number of cops joe haller and pete sylvester are among them approach the wagon
many are carrying canvas bags
he drops the blood stained bag hes carrying runs to the bushes and noisily blows his groceries
on oak street mrs
thayer is hurrying toward home obviously spooked
she keeps looking behind herself and nearly flies up the steps to her house
then there is the endless business of fumbling with her keys
finally she lurches inside and slams the door
on main street at the holy family rectory father obanion is closing the shutters
and locking them
on a residential street a kid is playing with some plastic trucks outside of a picket fence
except for him the street is deserted
his mother comes out and hauls him in
andy fairton in the sporting goods store checks an automatic pistol and then holsters it on his hip
he has a pugnacious unpleasant look
billy mcclaren turns the sign on the door of his barber shop from open to closed looks out warily at the street to make sure there are no psycho killers
out there for trims i guess then leaves and locks the door behind him
the camera follows him down a couple of store fronts to owens where he also goes in
the paper rack in front of peltzers drug the press herald headline is a sixteen pointer maniac claims theyre flying kites on the common
some distance in the b
is the bandstand
marty is of course flying his kite as he sits in the silver bullet
the boys are having a blast
the camera slowly moves away from the boys centers on owens pub across the street and zooms in
in the window is a poster
it reads reward for who killed stella randolph and milton sturmfuller
and at the bottom tarkers mills citizens committee
along comes andy fairton
he goes into the pub
at a f
table virgil cutts bobby robertson elmer zinneman and his brother porter zinneman
behind them at the bar we see pete sylvester having a beer with billy mcclaren
as we look around the bar we will also see father lester lowe sitting at an unobtrusive corner table nursing a beer and listening closely to the conversation
elmer to virgil dont tell me an animal cant rip a man up the way milt sturmfuller was ripped up
but the womans bed was ripped right down the middle elmer its take a chainsaw to do something like that
shut up porter
to virgil what about the tracks
andy fairton has joined the group
he sits down uninvited
that could be something to throw off the cops
and it aint animals that try to confues the law its people do that
law around here dont need much confusing
pete looks around at this
being the deputy constable and ineffectual by nature hes pretty sensitive
andy deep disgust joe haller couldnt find his own ass if someone rammed it full of radium and gave him a geiger counter
pete sylvester comes over could be i know a fella whos still pod over getting fined two hundred bucks for that little fender bender out on the ridge road last
could be i know a fat old fella who ought to take care of his mouth before someone comes along and turns it inside out
i pay joe hallers salary to keep the people in this town safe and he aint doing it
billy mcclaren at the bar hes looking toward the table where the fairton group sits
billy mildly last town report said you was in arrears your taxes andy
guess you must have paid up huh
what are you trying to be smart
owen knopfler comes over
you guys turn down the thermostat or im gonna turn you all out
now whos drinking
andy sulks bring me a schlitz
sound of panting
marty comes into the frame pulling himself up by the arms
his arms are very strong although his legs trail limply behind him like the tail of a kite
he sits on a branch untangles the kite and the string and looks down
marty calls here it comes
as the kite flutters down jane comes biking up
marty coslaw you get down out of that tree
he descends then hangs from the lowest branch
push the bullet over jane okay
jane makes no immediate move to do so supper was an hour ago dumbo
marty hanging oh jeez
is she mad
they both are
at me for not getting you sooner
i ought to let you fall
but she pushes the chair over and marty drops into it
he pushes the starter and the silver bullet fires up
marty voice hey brady
brady looking into the sky in a while
brady could give a shit if martys in trouble
he just waves vaguely
hes into the kite flying experience as the folks in marin county might say
hes looking toward the common frowning and uncertain
come on marty
she starts biking away
marty starts after her pauses and looks at camera pans slowly up to the yellow smile kite in the bluish purple sky
the former patrons are still here with the exceptions of lowe billy mcclaren and bobby robertson
many others have appeared this is happy hour
among them we see mr
aspinall the principal and peltzer the druggist
a barmaid norma circulates with drinks and beers
speaking of beer andy fairton has gotten through a fair amount of schlitz
it hasnt mellowed him however hes more belligerent than ever
andy holding forth this whole investigation has been as efficient as a polish fire drill
it pete bravely ive heard enough out of you andy
if you dont shut your mouth im going to shut it for you
it opens and a man in a business suit herb kincaid comes in
he is carrying a briefcase and he looks worried
andy astounded what did you say
he reaches under the bar and comes out with a baseball bat
burned into the side of the bat so it reads vertically toward the handle is the word peacemaker
owen hurries around the bar with it
pete is standing in front of andy fists balled up fat face trembling with determination
you heard what i said motormouth
andy gets up infuriated
theres apparently going to be a brawl
behind them herb kincaid has approached the table
herb hasnt even noticed whats going on hes got problems of his own
he clears his throat
this is a mild timid man he doesnt like to speak in public particularly not in a bar but the imperatives of the situation demand it right now
herb quite loudly has anyone in here seen my son brady
everyone looks at herb
andy and pete freeze with their fists balled up like little kids playing statues tag
owen is caught a little distance from andy and pete with the peacemaker still in his hands
now it is almost completely dark and a large reddish summer moon is rising over the horizon
all conversation has stopped
all have turned toward the door and the windows all hear the howl
deep fright overlies each face
norma drops her tray
glasses and bottles shatter
joe haller comes out of the constables office in a hurry letting the door bang the wall
hes buckling on his gun belt
bradys kite torn in a couple of places flutters on the steps leading up to the bandstand
the yellow smile face grins eerily in the darkness
it is streaked with blood
he breaks for the door
andy fairton grabs him
get out of my way
he pushes andy aside
herb is out the door chased by pete and several of the others
joe haller low voice hail mary full of grace the lord is with thee
blessed art thou among women
he comes out of the shadows his drawn gun dangling by his side
this man has had an extremely bad shock
the legs of his uniform pants are splashed with blood
he makes it down two steps and then sits heavily by the remains of bradys smiling bloody kite
he looks straight ahead
he looks at nothing
haller low and blessed is the fruit of thy womb
holy mary mother of god pray for us sinners now
he looks at the kite then looks away
he puts a hand over his face and starts to cry
a number of men not all that were in owens but quite a few of them are running toward the bandstand
herb kincaid is in the lead screaming his sons name over and over
sound a long howl now at some distance
as herb kincaid approaches
stay off the bandstand herb
is it my boy
is it brady
dont go up herb lunges past him brady
disappears into the dark
haller looks down at his lap
br cuts off the other men arrive pete in the lead
haller doesnt look up
joe is it haller not looking up shhh
is it the kicaid b haller not looking up shhh i said
the men look uneasily at haller at each other
andy fairton shoves forward
what the fuck is going on h sound herb screams
herb screams again
the men flinch back
haller doesnt look up
now from the darkness on the bandstand herb begins to laugh
the men shrink back further looking more uneasy than ever
herb voice laughing well bury his shoes
now haller gets up and joins the other men
herb voice laughing thats what well have to do well bury his shoes
maybe in a couple of roi tan cigar boxes
herb kincaid appears
he is laughing
he is smeared with his sons blood
in each hand he holds one of his sons shoes
well bury his shoes because his feet are still in them and theyre the only part of him that makes sense anymore
herb laughs harder
its gonna be the cheapest funeral this town ever saw
sound an organ is playing that sweet old hymn bringing in the sheaves
there are lots of cars parked in front of the church but theres a space left just big enough for uncle als mg
martys silver bullet is strapped to the back
jane v o my mother and father my mother in particular did not much care for uncle al
martys chair is at the back of the church
most of the mourners are crying
bowie is playing the organ
bradys coffin is on a bier at the front closed of course
there are lots of flowers
jane v o continues but when it came to such unpleasant duties as taking marty to the funeral of his best friend
as we look at them from left to right uncle al marty uncle al unobtrusively takes a small silver flask from his hip pocket
engraved on it in old english letters is the word rotgut
he spins the cap and takes a quick knock
he pauses and glances at marty who looks deeply stunned
jane v o continues they didnt at all mind drafting him
as to the sort of comfort uncle al may have been able to offer him
uncle al hands the flask to marty
marty looks at him questioningly for a moment and then drinks
marty looks at tammy who looks frankly terrible
her mother is looking away
marty nudges her
she looks around at him
he offers her the flask
her eyes widen
jane v o continues i now believe that was best kept between the two of them
after a brief moments consideration tammy takes the flask and has a deep swallow
she hands the flask back to marty who hands it quickly back to uncle al as tammy coughs
her mother looks at her
then at marty and uncle al
uncle al smiles sympathetically hiding the flask with one hand as if to say isnt it a terrible thing
sturmfuller looks distractedly back toward the service
jane v o concludes or among the three of them
uncle al pockets the flask just as the organ stops playing
kincaid have asked that there be no mass said here this afternoon
there will be a requiem mass for brady kincaid this sunday
they did ask me to say a word of comfort to you if i could
he looks out at them
they look back at lowe hoping for some help in understanding this awful thing
if there is any word of comfort i can give you its just this the face of the beast always becomes known the time of the beast always passes
he is struggling with this trying dreadfully hard
if there are times when we feel alone and afraid only small creatures in the dark then these are the times when we must turn to one another for our
comfort and our hope
to our neighbors
to our community
to our love for each other
i alone cannot ease the pain for herb and naomi kincaid nor can i ease your pain nor you ease mine
but if i believe anything its this we can comfort each other
we can heal each other
we can go on together
the kids are crying
marty puts an arm around tammy and she puts her head on his shoulder
the bible tells us not to fear the terror that creepeth by night or that which flieth by noonday and yet we do
because there is much we dont know and we feel very small
but we must not be alone
we must not allow ourselves to be alone for there is the wide gate to the hell of terror
turn to each other
join hands in your sorrow and try to remember that the face of the beast always becomes known
pause the time of the beast always passes
pause let us pray
marty and tammy look at each other miserably
tammy begins to cry for her father as much as for brady one would think and she and marty embrace
he looks at the kids with deep sympathy and deep love
uncle als sports car passes the camera
hes taking marty home
you all right marty
theres a saying so and so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick
you ever hear that one
well im not sure that was
they better get the guy
uncle al what if its not a guy
what if its some kind of monster
uncle al laughs jesus marty
come off it
it cruises past owens pub
there are cars parked out front but there are also lots of pickup trucks
whats going on at owens uncle al
a bunch of men getting ready to pretend theyre clint eastwood
marty didnt anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive in movies
uncle als car turns in and parks
tammy said shed been hearing noises in that greenhouse
growling noises like a big animal
her father was killed that night
uncle al looks at him doubtfully for a moment as if almost believing
then he shakes his head
marty you have to get this idea out of your head
psychotics are more active when the moon is full and this guy is a psycho
hes going to turn out to be as human as you or me
pause in a manner of speaking
now lets get you inside
he opens his door and gets out
he would like to believe uncle al
but he doesnt
okay you all know what group youre in and what area youll be covering right
shut up porter
the men are all dressed in hunting clothes red and black checked shirts orange caps etc
they all have guns
among their number are a few women as well looking tough and determined
we see almost everyone weve met up to this point
lowe is there looking deeply troubled
andy fairton is standing on the bar
these are his vigilantes he has organized them
andy radiates male macho football coach confidence
hes mesmerized the crowd they really believe they are going to go out and shoot one for the gipper
groups one through four are in the woods north of the sturmfuller place
five and six west of carson creek
the door at the back opens haller and pete come in
joe haller is in extremely bad shape
he hasnt come back much from the murder of brady
i believe he is having some sort of spiritual crisis and while it is not our purpose to explore what it might be this is after all a horror movie
and not a john cassavetes film we can see that it has seriously weakened his authority
andy continuing moonrise at p
some nervous laughter greets this
meanwhile haller and pete are working their way to the front where they end up next to a grim faced herb kincaid
andy continuing if he comes out to stroll in the moonlight tonight were going to get the sorry sucker
porter happily damn straight
shut up porter
just remember its the psycho we want not each other
so look before you i want all of you folks to go home
a disgruntled murmur meets this
haller moves forward a bit and turns to face them
i cant remember deputizing a single one of you
thats right joe the only deputy you got is that fat shitbag beside you and neither one of you has done a damn thing about solving this case
there is a mutter of agreement
andy hops off the bar to face haller directly
in the b
we see herb kincaid kincaid by the way should be wearing a black armband hes come directly from his sons funeral
haller without much force well catch him
you couldnt catch a cold
haller looks at him for a moment then turns to look at the crowd
they look rather like a lynch mob on their faces we see an uneasy mix of shame and eager determination
haller speaks with a kind of haggard fading desperation
the law has a name for what you men are planning
its private justice and private justice is about a step and a half away from lynch mobs and hang ropes
im no j
edgar hoover but i am the law in tarkers mills and i want you men to go home
they shuffle their feet uneasily many look down
he is getting to them
dont let this guy scare you
whats he done since this thing started but hang his face out
its not working
many of the men look disgusted with both andy and themselves
andy louder he aint got so much as a fingerprint
ah shut up andy
dont tell me to herb kincaid steps forward
andy surprised and bewildered does
herb turns and looks grimly at joe haller who can barely meet his gaze
herb quietly i just came from my boys funeral
i know how upset how grief stricken you must be
but herb quietly he was torn apart
utter silence in owens place now
the others are staring rapt
yes but herb still quiet upset you say
grief stricken you say
constable you dont know what those words mean
my son was torn to pieces
herb turns to the others in the pub
tears stream down his face
my son was torn to pieces
turning back to haller you come in here and talk to these men about private justice
you dare to do that
constable haller why dont you go out to harmony hill and dig up whats left of brady and explain to him about private justice
would you want to do that
haller makes no reply
he looks down at his feet
i thought not
to the others you folks stay here if you want
i wouldnt ask anyone to do anything that runs counter to his conscience
as for me
im going out and hunt up a little private justice
andy fairton has swelled up again
he grins poisonously at the slumped haller
he pushes off after herb kincaid
other men start to follow
men are streaming out getting into station wagons and pickup trucks
engines roar into life
they begin backing out even as more men come out of the pub
we even hear some high spirited yells they are on their way and their blood is up
lester lowe looking more distressed than ever pushes his way through the men toward the door and the camera follows
he grabs billy mcclaren
billy this is a bad idea
billy not looking at lowe joes had his chance father
leave me be
he pushes outside
lowe looks around wildly his face says he cant believe this is happening
he grabs porter zinneman then as porter shoves by him at a couple of others with mounting desperation
haller makes his way to lowe through the thinning crowd and draws him aside
let them go
but this is that spirit of community you were talking about
grand aint it
maybe theyll shoot a hitchhiker or something and andy can mount the head and raffle it off
to benefit the medcu van of course
but cant we do anything
owen knopfler hurries past them he has a rifle over one shoulder in a sling
in his left hand he carries the peacemaker bat
we can pray to christ that none of them get killed
more cars and trucks pull away
theres a big old ford woody wagon still there with andy fairton standing impatiently by the drivers side door
billy mcclaren and bobby robertson are with him and a big solid looking woman named maggie andrews
owen comes out and crosses to the woody
well its about frigging time
theyll have his hide tacked to somebodys barn door before we get out there
they pile into the car andy behind the wheel
he throws it into gear and backs out onto main street
we see a parade of cars and pickup trucks headed out of town
hes standing on the curb and watching them leave town in procession some honking their horns others yelling cheerfully
the expression on his face is dark and brooding
elmer is lying on his belly stuck halfway under a barbed wire fence
the seat of his pants is badly snagged
the brothers are on the verge of a wooded area
we can see ground mist creeping around the bottoms of the trees
help me porter goddammit
porter grabs elmers right arm and pulls
theres a ripping sound
dont pull me
you want to rip the right cheek of my ass right off
well elmer there are folks thatd say youve been half assed most of your are you going to unhook me or be a wise guy
porter begins to pick the barbed wire out of elmers pants
obanion looks rather amusing in his hunting gear like that priest from the exorcist on safari
jesus that was close
uh pardon me revrunt
they move slowly ahead obanion still a bit in the lead
the camera follows as the reverend pushes into some knee high brush
sound a rusty metallic clang followed by a fleshy chomp
obanion begins to scream and struggle
what is it
obanion screaming my foot
virgil lunges to him and looks down
a medium sized trap something in which one might reasonably catch a wild cat or a coydog let us say has its rusty teeth sunk deeply into the reverends ankle
get it off me
get it off me
virgil flustered sure
he kneels down
he muscles the trap open a little at a time
startled and unnerved by the howl the trap slips out of his hands and snaps shut on obanions mangled ankle again
it slides behind a cloud
andy billy mcclaren bobby robertson owen knopfler and maggie andrews have been joined by two other men mr
aspinall and edgar rounds
they have drawn close together listening as the howl fades
we can tell by their uneasy faces that some of the joy has gone out of the evening
they are standing on one side of a ravine
the bottom is filled with a still ground mist
a few bushes poke out of it
there are woods on the far side
andy pointing across it came from over there
as far as i could tell it could have come from anywhere
well spread out in a skirmish line
if the bastard tries to go around us well hear him
i dunno i think bobby robertson heres making lemonade in his pants
that lemonade got ice cubes in it bobby
andy fairton and edgar rounds laugh
aspinall and billy mcclaren smile a little
owen quietly let off him maggie
im scared too
bobby stoutly i aint scared
spread out on me
five feet apart
reading from right to left owen knopfler his gun is still over his shoulder it is the peacemaker baseball bat he is holding bobby robertson aspinall andy fairton billy mcclaren
edgar rounds and maggie andrews
they come slowly down toward the camera alert and ready for anything at least they think so
they reach the bottom of the ravine and begin to make their way across it
the mist is waist to chest deep
they push toward the other side
now they are about halfway
they all stop scared
billy mcclaren wheres it coming from
no its behind us
i told you you couldnt trust it isnt on either side
what are you aspinall is looking around his eyes widening with fear
its under the fog
its right in with us
the growling stops
theres a beat of silence
then sound snarling
and a ripping chomp as dinner is served
hes the one screaming and if he reminds us of obanion thats okay because rounds has also been caught in a trap
he tries to run stumbles falls into the ground fog
he goes on screaming
we can see his back for a moment and then it disappears
his hand and arm come up like the hand of a drowning man
then its gone
rounds is gone
they stand there chest deep in mist a conspicuous hole in the ranks where edgar was
bobby moaning i cant move
christ jesus i cant move
the growling starts again
the camera pans slowly up the line
the mist swirls hiding whatevers beneath
aspinall low i think we better start backing up andy
real the low growl rises to a snarl
and from below the mist snarling and bestial but understandable mocking aspinalls voice werewolf voice real slow
aspinall shrieks and tries to run
he falls into the mist
there is another chomp
when he flounders up half his face is gone
werewolf voice real slow
a hairy arm rises from the mist and yanks aspinall down
they panic and break for it maggie billy and andy for one side bobby and owen for the other
the camera is rushing through the ground mist this is like being in an airplane thats skimming the top of a cloud
werewolf voice laughing real slow
hes hit as an unlucky swimmer might be hit by a shark
he whirls around raising the peacemaker bat
come on then
you want to rock and roll with me
for a moment theres nothing and then the werewolf rises out of it eyes glaring green muzzle and pelt slimed with gore
maggie shrieking look at it
holy god andy look at that thing
andy groaning with fear i dont want to look at it
he runs while maggie stares mesmerized at the werewolf closes in on owen who belts it a good one with the peacemaker
the werewolf swipes at him
owen ducks and slams it again
the werewolf roars with anger
come on come on
you want to do the bop
ill bop you motherfucker
the werewolf dives under the ground mist
uncertain owen begins to back up holding the bat in his hands
owen is jerked down into the mist
the peacemaker rises out of the ground mist and comes down
the werewolf roars in pain
owen voice come on you bastard
the peacemaker rises out of the mist again
the hands holding it are bloody
blood runs down the bat
the werewolf roars again
there is a gurgling scream from owen
and then a curious splintering sound as the werewolf sinks its fangs into the bat
the camera moves above as the werewolf moves below escaping down the draw
sound in the b
low but slowly getting louder a congregation singing bringing in the sheaves to the accompaniment of a pipe organ
werewolf sing songy voice bringing in the sheaves
bringing in the sheaves
we shall come rejoicing
bringing in the sheaves
the werewolf fades out human voices singing the same hymn overwhelm it and we its an almost exact reprise of
most of the mourners are crying mrs
bowie playing the organ martys chair parked at the back
we can see uncle al marty tammy and mrs
sturmfuller exactly as they were at brady kincaids funeral in fact this seems to be an instant reply of that event
one difference we cant see bradys coffin
its below us
the hymn ends
kincaid have asked that there be no mass said here this afternoon
they did ask me to say a word of comfort to you if i could
he sits in the first pew
in his grief he looks dead
there is no comfort father
only private justice
hes thrown off his stride
beginning to sweat
hes like an actor trying to remember his lines
uh if theres any word of comfort i can give you its just this the face of the beast always becomes known the time he looks down
his eyes widen in fear
yes thats coffins plural
where bradys coffin was formerly there are now six coffins smothered with flowers
he is badly scared now sweat is dripping off him
the time of the beast always passes
there are answers
if we turn to each other
herb bestial voice father lowe looks toward hes looking down at something in his hands
now he looks up and we see his face has become bestial
his eyes are green
as we look at him the transformation cotinues
hes turning into a werewolf
herb snarling it tore out his heart
and sure enough herb kincaid holds bradys dripping heart up in what were hands but which are now rapidly becoming paws
he staggers back in terror
lowe shrieks no
bowie begins bringing in a few more sheaves on the church organ and the congregation begins to sing
sowing in the morning sowing seeds of kindness sowing in the noontide and the dewy eve
we pan their faces stopping on joe haller
now something is happening to joes face
it is bulging changing
he looks up from his hymnal and his eyes glare green
the pupils are split
he grins showing big teeth
they are all changing
among the things we see are pete sylvester who is a church deacon rushing down the aisle changing snarling
he grabs andy fairton and the two of them grapple in the aisle
a young woman with a baby in her arms turns back the blanket covering the babys face and we see its a wolfling already the young womans own hands are
turning into claws
tammy sturmfuller changing peltzer the druggist changing the zinneman brothers changing
at the organ mrs
bowie is now a werewolf clad in tatters of a silk bombazine dress she it is still wearing a veiled hat on her head and she is beating the shit
out of the organ keys with her clawed hands
she sounds like jerry lee lewis after swallowing about a dozen bennies
and now the tune changes from the remnants of bringing in the sheaves
it changes into the rheingold jingle
congregation snarling chorus my beer is rheingold the dry beer
think of rheingold whenever you buy beer
father lowe goes stumbling backward dropping his hymnal
the man is in an extremity of terror
some are tearing their hymnals apart and throwing them at each other
one guy billy mcclaren maybe wings one of them through a stained glass window
some of the werewolves for they are all werewolves now fight or make love in the aisles
the rest sway back and forth grinning ferociously singing
congregation snarling it out its not bitter not sweet its a real frosty treat
he looks toward she grins ferociously up at him playing the rheingold jingle on the pipe organ with her claws
now blood begins to bubble up between the keys
wont you try wont you buy
the church is a wild shambles of lurching fighting singing werewolves
its like a new years eve party in hell
congregation big finish rheiinngold beer
suddenly a clawed hand burts up through one of the coffins
and andy fairton who now looks as wolflike as any of them bites the hands claw off
hes seen all he can stand
he whirls for the back where there is a small door
he pulls it open
and a brady kincaid werewolf half torn apart but still somehow alive a zombie werewolf if you can dig it george romero would like it i think leaps out and
brady buries his muzzle in lowes neck
he sits up into the camera and screams
sweat is running down his face
he stares at us for a moment his eyes buggy and crazed
and then he closes them
there is an expression of huge relief on his face as he does so
lowe praying let it end dear lord
let it end
please let it end
an old sedan cruises slowly down the street
anne and tammy sturmfuller are in the front seat
its piled high with possessions and is towing a jackleg trailer with more stuff in it
haller indifferently anne sturmfuller and her little girl
but what are they doing
putting on my sherlock holmes deerstalker cap i deduce that they are leaving
they are headed out of town all right but the thing which perhaps strikes us the most forcibly is how empty this place is now
main street looks like a ghost town
shes not the only one
lot of people leaving town
and i guess if we want a beer well have to drink it at home
he nods toward a closed sign hangs in the door above it is a big black wreath
joe whats wrong with you
i aint never seen you like this
haller thoughtful i lost my guts
pete startled bullshit
it was the kincaid boy
i looked at him
and i felt it happen
it was no big deal
no worse than pissing down your own leg
you ever do that
maybe when you were real scared
pete distressed does not respond
one minute i had me some guts as much as the next man anyhow and then poof
petes looking at him in a kind of terror
you are going to feel better than this
this feeling of yours
its gonna pass
he walks away back toward the municipal building the sign out front reminds folks to support the medcu van
while pete looks after him very deeply troubled
rides stand still
the midway is deserted
the camera pans slowly to a sign which reads tarkers mills fairgrounds gala fair october fireworks at dusk c on a cheerful enough sign except for the strip of paper
glued diagonally across it fireworks canceled
marty voice its not fair
its parked across the road from the sign
jane voice look out world
marty the great didnt get something he wanted
they are distributed just as they were when they arrived at this same fairgrounds earlier
all of them have ice cream cones they are coming home from a family outing
stop it jane
well i dont see why everybody just about breaks down and cries whenever he stop it your mother said
theyve just paused for a quick look at the sign now bob pulls out onto the road again and heads toward home
jane sticks her tongue out at him
marty looks away
uncle als sports car is parked in the driveway
we hear the clang of a wrench on the cement inside
uncle al and marty are working on the engine of the silver bullet
uncle al has a six pack of beer that hes working through
he and marty sit on the floor
as they talk uncle al unscrews the last bolt holding the bullets carburetor and pulls it off
it isnt enough that the monster killed all those people that he killed brady
now hes got them to cancel the fair
and the fireworks
hand me that box marty
marty hands him a medium sized carton with the words speed shop printed on it
yeah okay the fireworks
jane thinks thats all im mad about but its not
them doing that is just a
its just an outward symbol of everything thats inwardly wrong in this town
not bad huh
i read sherwood anderson in college
i can jive that shit all day
i like it that you always know how to say things uncle al
ill give you the telephone numbers of my ex wives dear boy theyll be interested to hear that
dont call me dear boy
but you are you know you are my dear boy
he gives marty a kiss and smiles at him
marty smiles back
look at this
he pulls out a brand new carburetor its a chrome plated four barrel
uncle al gleeful this is gonna turn your wheelchair into a fucking f marty he looks around quickly guiltily
your moms not around is she
she and dad are out back lighting the barbecue
janes walking around like shes king shit of turd mountain
only in her case i guess it would be queen shit of turd mountain
hand me that adjustable
uncle al slides the carb onto the gasket and starts attaching bolts
the guy killed your best friend drove your girl out of town and stole the second best holiday in the year
have i got it right
marty glum you got it right uncle al
yeah winesburg ohio was never like that
but i got something that just might cheer you up
wait dear boy
hand me those pliars
he peeks into the backyard
bob and nan are fussing over the barbecue
jane is hitting a badminton birdie
marty is sitting in the silver bullet
uncle al comes hurrying back from his look see
all is cool marty boy
go for it
marty pushes the starter
the engine starts at once but the tone is entirely different
before martys wheelchair was a poppety popping pussycat
now the engine rumbles like a hoods street rod idling at a traffic light
marty looks startled
uncle al grinning gun it
marty guns it
the engine roars
not too much
marty awed wow
you got a pilots license marty
do i need one
were gonna find out
take it down the road a ways and back
marty puts the bullet in gear and pulls away
camera tracks him up the road
he goes slowly at first but he lets it out a little after a while
hes really moving along thirty maybe forty miles an hour
the wind blows the hair off his forehead
he begins to grin
hes enjoying this
he drinks some beer
hes grinning happy for marty
he slows down turns stops
he revs the engine
a lot of changes back here
it looks almost like a motorcyle engine now
that chromed silver carb predominates
looking at its about a quarter of a mile away
he winds the engine up and pops the clutch
the silver bullet doesnt so much accelerate as blast off
it tilts back on its wheels
marty swivels into a position like that of an astronaut on lift off
the silver bullet looks like a motorcycle popping a wheelie
marty has a great big grin on his face
roaring down the highway at fifty or better blue smoke jetting from the exhaust
marty is plastered back in the seat with the footrest pointing up at an angle
hes laughing like a lunatic
uncle al to himself the kids dead meat
what have i done
shouts put a rock in it marty
he uses the hand brakes
sound of braking and squealing rubber
the silver bullet comes to a screeching sluing stop near uncle al
blue smoke drifts up from the wheels
marty guns the engine once and then lets it idle
you gave me a heart attack marty
i hope youre happy because you are looking at a dying man
it really goes fast
thanks uncle al
it goes fast all right and if your mother finds out just how fast marty i will have a new job
singing soprano with the vienna boys choir
i dont get you
i know you dont
but i want this to be our secret
you get that dont you
the last bit of daylight is just filtering away
the barbecue is over
bob and jane are putting lawn chairs on the back porch
marty nan and uncle al are all in the f
ive got to go nan i had a wonderful time
he kisses her cheek affectionately and she smiles at him
so have i actually
i wish it could always be like this
see me around to my car marty and make sure i stay out of trouble at least that long
he and uncle al go around to the driveway
nan looks at them with troubled love
now i said i had something for you as i believe you will recall
what is it
al unlocks the trunk of his car and brings out a paper shopping bag
he places the bag in martys lap
marty opens the bag but its really too dark to see inside
he reaches in and brings out a handful of assorted fireworks crackers roman candles twizzers smoke bombs etc
an expression of sublime delight fills martys face as he inventories these goodies
youre gonna have the fourth of july in october marty
just dont blow your head off
pause and remember that it isnt just the fireworks
its because no crazy shithead should be able to stop the good guys if you can dig that
marty respectfully i can dig it thank you uncle al
stay near the house for christs sake someones killing people
i have to be out of my mind to be doing this you know
yeah i know
one of the reasons i love you marty is that youre almost as crazy as i am
please dont set off anything that goes bang tonight okay
just bright colors
can you tell the difference
save this one for last
he brings out a short rocket with stubby vanes on the end
a fat fuse sticks out behind the head
what is it
youll like it
thanks a million uncle al
youre welcome a million marty
stick em in the bushes for now
marty motors over to the side of the garage where theres a line of bushes and conceals the bag in them
uncle al gets in his car and starts it up
marty comes back
uncle al grinning have a good time dear boy
and watch out for the werewolves
marty sits in his wheelchair waving
theres a downspout outside one of the upstairs windows
now the window goes up and marty leans out
he grasps the downspout and begins working his way down
this should not be too hard for us to believe weve already seen how strong martys arms are
his legs dangle limply but hes doing just fine
when he reaches the bottom of the drainpipe they simply crumple under him and he uses his arms to pull himself over to the back porch
marty hoists himself over the porch rail
here under a tarp is the silver bullet
marty pushes the tarp aside and gets in
he uses his hands on the wheels to get over the porch ramp and rolls silently down it
at the bottom he looks up at still a light on up there
marty whispers shit
thinks a bit then starts to hand roll the bullet toward marty comes slowly up the path
we hear soft grunts of exertion hes still hand turning the wheels for the sake of silence and its hard work
he stops at the line of bushes and gets the bag of fireworks
he puts it on his lap and starts moving again
the driveway has a slight downslant and marty coasts easily out to the road
he turns right and begins to roll slowly along the verge of the highway still using his hands
we can see that the light is still on upstairs
marty turns back once to verify this himself then keeps on going
hes not going to be deprived of his treat
he decides hes far enough away to be safe
he pushes the starter button
the engine cranks coughs and cranks some more
marty frowns and pulls out a wire a rudimentary choke i suppose
he pushes the starter button again
it cranks but doesnt start
marty pushes in the wire looking concerned now and tries again
this time after the engine has cranked over a few times it starts
marty softly all right
he puts it in gear and starts off
what we see is a tiny boy in a tiny wheelchair moving along a dark empty ribbon of road under a vast dome of stars
distant sound the bullets engine
sound fast rushing water
the turnout is packed dirt
theres a grove of trees with picnic tables spotted among them at the back
the sign in the extreme f
reads roadside rest area at the top auger falls in the middle township of tarkers mills at the bottom
sound the silver bullet approaching
marty turns in and rolls to the back of the rest area
he stops by one of the picnic tables and dumps the bag of fireworks out onto the picnic table and takes his time selecting the first hes like a wine
fancier with a whole cellar of rare bottles to choose from
at last he chooses a twizzer
he takes matches from the pocket of his pajama top and lights the fuse
when it starts to fizz marty tosses it high into the air
marty soft heres one for the good guys
it flies in an arc over the drop
the camera tracks its fall onto some rocks at the edge of the waterfalls catch pool
it has been drinking from the creek
it looks more than half human now we would be able to recognize it for sure but its face is in shadow
it turns from the creek and gets up on its hind legs
its guttering out
a hand paw touches it and draws back quickly
sound hurt angry growl
hes getting ready to light one of the fountains
he pauses and looks toward the cut
hes heard something but the waterfall muffles it
he lights the fountains fuse sets it on the ground and rolls the bullet back a few feet
the fountain bursts into a shower of light
marty delighted all right
the waterfall is in the b
the werewolf is climbing the rocky slope
it goes out
he rolls over to the picnic table and gets a roman candle
he plants the stick in the ground and lights the fuse
the roman candle shoots into the sky
bursts into colored light
and shakes its fists at the fading light in the sky
hes holding another fountain in one hand and his matches in the other
hes looking toward the cut and the waterfall
is someone there
it freezes growling faintly
with a little shrug he lights the fuse on the fountain and sets it on the ground as before
claw hands settle over the top
it throws off fiery swirls of sparks then begins to die down
hes checking out the stuff on the table for his next choice when he hears a clear sound a snapping splintering branch
its run into a low hanging branch
instead of pushing it aside or ducking under it it simply rips it off the tree
although the branch is pretty big the werewolf does this as easily as a hungry man might rip a drumstick off a thanksgiving turkey
it throws the branch aside and advances hunched over on two legs
marty terrified whos there
the grove is a darkened shadowland
he punches the bullets starter
the motor cranks and cranks
no go though
marty pulls out the choke wire alternating terrified stares at the grove of trees with terrified stares at his rudimentary dashboard
here it comes out of the shadows closing in
working that starter for all its worth
but the motor only cranks
still no start
he gives up on the motor
he looks toward the picnic table where the fireworks are
he grabs up the tracer
he gets the matches out of the breast pocket of his p
s and promptly drops them in his lap
he scrabbles for them
we cant see its face in the dark but its closer
he tries to hold the tracer and strike a match at the same time
he cant to do that hed need at least one more hand
he puts the tube of the tracer between his teeth and tries again
he strikes the match
it bends the neck broken
marty voice moaning oh please
he is in an extremity of terror
he pulls a fresh match from the book and strikes it
it recoils we still cant see its face except for a vague shadow
note i keep emphasizing the shadowed face because this is not a full moon period
ive been going on the assumption that the guy kind of works his way up to full wolfiness toothiness hairiness etc
starting with a partial change at about the second quarter
its a process like the tide coming in
thus if we saw martys attacker clearly at this point i think we would recognize him
he takes the tracer from his mouth and applies the match to the fuse
it splutters alight
the werewolf is less than twenty feet away
the tracer flares alight and shoots out of martys hand leaving a pink orange trail of smoke behind it
the missile flies at the werewolfs head
the tracer strikes it in the face and we see a flash of fire
the werewolf screams and blunders away
he punches the starter again
the motor cranks
the motor coughs and fires a big blue flame jumps from the fancy carb
and the engine starts to run
its staggering away roaring and howling
the tube of the tracer is sticking out of its face from its left eye in fact like an indians arrow
the werewolf smashes branches out of its way
he wheels the bullet around and heads for the road gasping and weeping with fear
its blundering through the trees
it pulls the tube from its face with an animal scream and drops it
it lies smoldering on the ground
the end is slick with blood
the bullet is really wheeling
marty is panting out of breath still deeply frightened
we see it blundering along holding its face blood bubbles through its fingers
werewolf snarling voice bastard marty
he powers up it and along the path to the back
perhaps he has enough speed to cut the engine and coast
his bed is by the window
his hands appear on the windowsill and marty pulls himself in
he falls over onto his bed and lies there spent and exhausted and trembling
hes sitting in the house wheelchair in the living room holding the phone tensely to his ear as the ringing sound goes on
a click as the phone is picked up
uncle al muzzy voice lo
its a werewolf
i saw it
last night not a really spiffy place the decor is early american alcoholic
theres a mostly unclad lady asleep on one side of the bed
uncle al is sitting on the other in his skivvies phone to his ear
there are a lot of bottles and heaped ashtrays around and uncle al has a big old hangover
you dreamed it marty
marty voice no
i went out late last night and there are no such things as werewolves
please dear boy have some pity
he hangs up and falls back into bed
girl muzzy voice whowuzzit
obscene phone caller
go back to sleep
hes sitting on the silver bullet just looking at the yard
jane comes out
youve just been sitting here all morning
jane i have to talk to you
jane mistrustfully about what
marty looks at her earnestly
i need you to help me
uncle al wont believe me and if you wont help me i
marty has to stop
hes almost crying
jane concerned marty what is it
jane is pushing a supermarket shopping cart with a lot of beer and soda bottles in it
on the side is a sign reading medcu bottle and can drive plus an outline drawing of the medcu unit
jane voice over he told me something that was clearly unbelievable
and yet somehow i believed most of it
and i understood one thing with total clarity marty himself believed it all
she turns into a yard and pulls her cart up the walk to the door
she mounts the steps and rings the bell
a sheer curtain at one side of the door is pulled aside and a fearful face that of mrs
thayer looks out
then we hear bolts being pulled and locks at least three of them being unlocked
the lady is taking no chances
jane politely im collecting returnable bottles and cans for the medcu drive missus thayer i just wondered if you had any
her husband comes up the hall
who is it
what we see mostly are her eyes bright inquiring
what we see mostly are his brown eyes
bring your cart around to the back jane well look in the garage
she starts down the steps and we amazing how deserted tarkers mills looks
jane is pushing her cart
even more bottles in it now
jane voice over uncle al hadnt believed him but uncle al was thirty five that summer and i was fourteen
at fourteen you can still believe the unbelievable although even then that ability is growing rusty is preparing to squeal to a stop
she is passing the holy family rectory
lester lowe is out front digging in his flower garden
he is shirtless back to jane and to us his black shirt with the turned around collar hangs informally on a bush
jane calls hi father lowe
lowe without turning top of the morning to you jane coslaw
im going to bring in a monster load of bottles in an hour or so
lowe still digging thats great jane
ill be waiting
she stops at robertsons luncheonette leaves her cart outside and goes in
the camera floats to the window we see jane explaining about the bottle campaign to bobby while a few men seated at the counter listen
wide eyes mostly
as she turns away her eyes sweep the men at the counter
some of them peltzer virgil cutts are familiar
others are not
the camera pans their faces closely featuring she grabs the handle of the cart again and proceeds down main street
she goes into the barber shop
jane v o marty had seen where the tracer had struck home he said and i went out that day doing more than just looking for returnable cans and bottles
i was looking for a man or woman with only one eye
as jane enters billy mcclaren is giving one man a trim
another man is tipped back with his face wrapped in a towel
two or three other townies are waiting on tonsorial beautification reading magazines
none of course has only one eye
jane checks them all out carefully
i know what youre after jane and youre out of luck
little toby whittislaw was in yesterday and i gave em all to him
but her eyes have fixed on the towel over the face of the man in the other barber chair
she walks over to him
that you mr
andy fairton muffled no its ronald mcdonald
i came in for a shave and a burger
the men laugh
jane smiles politely
and pulls the hot towel away from his eyes
his two eyes
jane sweetly got any bottles mr
jane just as sweet oh
she puts the towel back and the camera follows as she returns to the door
billy amused bye jane
andy muffled jesus
jane goes out
she pushes the shopping cart up to the gate opens it and goes up the walk to the foot of lowes porch steps
she leaves it there and climbs to the porch
the screen door is shut the inner wooden door open
dark and empty
sounds in the kitchen
eating sounds maybe or maybe we cant tell
she knocks on the screen door
im ready to turn in my bottles and cans
lowe is standing by the refrigerator door
hes holding a raw leg of lamb and tearing at it with his teeth
lamb blood smears his face and runs down his arms
he is as human as you or me in a manner of speaking as uncle al would say but when jane speaks his head snaps up and his eye flares
his one eye
the other is covered by a patch
jane voice father
take your cart around to the garage and unload jane
then bring me your tally sheet
she goes down the steps and starts to push the cart around the house
he crosses to the window over the kitchen sink the bloody chunk of meat still in his hands and looks out
she pushes the cart along a path toward a combination garage and utility shed at the back
still watching jane he begins to gnaw ravenously at the meat again
she opens the door and slowly pushes her cart inside
this is a creepy little place now filled with bottles and cans that have been crammed in helter skelter every which way
jane obviously doesnt like it
she begins to unload her cart rapidly mumbling numbers to herself
jane looks down
a good sized mouse comes out from between a pile of stacked bottles and runs across janes shoe
she utters a litle scream and shrinks back against the wall bumping it quite hard
hard enough to knock something off an overhead shelf
it falls into the bottles shattering several
jane screams again not terribly loud and then slowly bends toward the object and picks it up
jane holds it both puzzled and scared
jane approaches it holding a piece of paper in her hand her tally sheet
there is no answer
she knocks again
she tries the door
after a moment of interior debate jane enters the kitchen
she looks around
no one here
but there is a bloody spot on the counter lowe must have set his grisly luncheon down here for a moment
she walks slowly across the kitchen and into the dark hall
ive got my tally sheet
farther into the hall
a hand drops onto her shoulder
lowe voice very good jane
she jumps and so do we
she turns around and looks up at featuring his eyes his eye rather
the left is covered with a black eye patch
lowe grins good jane
he holds his hand out and jane puts the tally sheet in it like one in a dream
she cant take her eyes off that black patch which tells her everything
lowe concerned jane
i dont feel so well i guess maybe i got too much sun
would you like to come in the parlor and lie down for a bit
or have a cold drink
i have some soda no
softer that is i have to get home and help my mom with lunch
ill give you a ride
jane is retreating down the hall toward the front door
she was going to meet me at the market
ill be fine
how much does he know
how much has he guessed
hard to tell from his face which now seems sinister with its eye patch
give my best to your brother jane
camera holds on him standing silent and enigmatic
lowe soft real slow
his eyes are wide
hes leaning forward in his wheelchair
marty almost moaning oh jeez
what did you do then
shes changed into shorts and a blouse
i ran faster than i ever ran in my life what do you think dummox
by the time i got back here i really thought i was going to faint
pause what are we going to do marty
if we tried to tell anybody grown ups i mean theyd laugh
what are we going to do
marty thoughtfully i think i know
a hand martys comes into the frame and prints i know who hes sitting at his desk a pool of light from the lamp focused on the sheet of paper
he thinks a moment then begins to write again
he is adding why dont you kill yourself
he studies this for a second and seems satisfied
he opens a drawer brings out an envelope and folds his letter into it
she has the letter in her hand
she approaches the mailbox opens the mailbox door and then glances at the envelope again
addressed in pencil it says father lester lowe holy family she drops the letter in with the air of a girl lighting the fuse on a packet of high explosives
she turns away toward home
hes standing at the window and looking out
the torn open envelope is on an end table beside him
hes holding the lined sheet of paper in his hand
an expression of bitter hate twists his features and he slowly crumples the paper in his fist
she drops in another letter and walks away
jane v o i mailed another letter for marty the next day
a third the day after that
then on saturday
parked at the curb is uncle als sports car
jane v o we told uncle al what wed been up to
pause his reaction was less than serene
holy jumped up baldheaded jesus christ
uncle al uncle al to jane from him id expect it
i sometimes think his common sense got paralyzed along with his legs
but you jane
little polly practical
jane quiet you dont understand
uncle al wildly oh i understand plenty
i understand that my niece and nephew are sending the local catholic priest little love notes suggesting that he gargle with a broken light bulb or eat a rat poison
it came for me
i shot it in the eye
now hes wearing an eye patch
i called peltzer on my way over here marty
father lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution
thats a fancy way of saying eyewash
hes got a corneal inflammation
was it a prescription
what the hell does that matter
it wasnt ill bet you it wasnt
because to get a prescription hed have to see a doctor
marty marty you should hear yourself
was it a prescription
i dont know
but i know you didnt see any werewolf the other night marty
you had a dream thats all
an extremely realistic nightmare brought on by whats been happening in this town
what about the baseball bat jane saw in his shed
you know who used to have a baseball bat like that
he was so proud of it he used to carry it in the fourth of july parade
jane said it looked like the green giant used it for a toothpick
you want to know what i think
no we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face
watch it dear boy
i think it was a hallucination
probably a broomstick or something
jane indignant it was not
you want me to show you
im not afraid
ill show you right now
no thank you jane
im a little old for palying the hardy boys meet the catholic werewolf
jane stamps her foot furious with uncle al
never mind jane
hell have gotten rid of it by now anyway
the silver bullet stands outside
the door opens and uncle al jane and marty come out
uncle al is carrying marty piggyback
marty has an ice cream cone
jane is holding two
uncle al squats depositing marty in the bullet
marty starts the engine as jane hands uncle al his ice cream cone
the three of them start up the street and the camera tracks if father lowe is an innocent little lamb why hasnt he picked up the telephone and called constable
haller to tell him martys sending poison pen letters
i dont accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is jane
because i dont accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw marty in his wheelchair
why hasnt he picked up the phone and told constable haller that someone is sending him poison pen letters
uncle al stops
he hasnt thought of this
he looks toward lester lowe is mowing the lawn eye patch and all
uncle al a bit perplexed well
he probably did
i mean he could make a complaint without taking an ad out in the paper couldnt he
ill bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription
and ill bet you another quarter he hasnt said anything to mr
marty do you see your suspect
keeps on moving
aspinall drives by and waves
lowe waves back
marty grim yes i see him
do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn
hed either be in the hospital
i didnt shoot him when he was a man
i shot him when he was when he was a werewolf
jane you dont really believe this madness do you
i dont know exactly what i believe
but i know that what i saw was a baseball bat and not a broomstick
i know there was something strange about the way the house smelled that day
it smelled like an animals den
and i believe in marty
i mean there are times when he makes me so mad i could kill him but i still believe in him
pause you used to believe in him too uncle al
uncle al looks momentarily ashamed of himself
then he throws his hands up in disgust
he walks ahead of them
marty bats his eyes sweetly at jane
she walks on miffed
marty gooses the silver bullet to catch up
a bunch of kids are playing baseball
in the extreme f
we see one small boy marty sitting back to us in his wheelchair watching
it draws slowly along a tree lined lane and stops
lester lowe is behind the wheel
lowe quietly little bastard
the field team heads in
kids start streaming back toward town
the outfielder who caught the fly trots past and glances his way
you comin down to robertsons for a soda marty
no i guess ill go home
i think that here we are seeing a rare moment of depression in marty they can run and play ball
he fires up the bullet and starts away alone
he starts it up
he bumps up a grassy slope to a tarred road
the last of the other kids are headed back the other way
marty is alone
it turns out of the lane where it was parked and onto the road
martys back is to us
the wheelchair draws rapidly closer to the camera as lowe bears down on it
he leans over the wheel grinning sadistically
lowe whispers bastard
hes daydreaming his way along maybe inside his head hes playing center field for the dodgers
sound winding roar of a car engine
marty turns around
marty opens the throttle wide and the bullet swerves across the road
the coupes bumper actually clips it on the way by jolting marty and almost overturning the bullet
lowes coupe veers over the embankment and partway down into the ditch
oh you bastard
he floors the engine
spinning helplessly in the dirt
he speeds past the coupe and thumbs his nose
hes in a teeth grinding fury
he jams the gear shift lever into reverse and floors the gas pedal again
it roars backward in a cloud of ditch dust and bounces onto the road
then it screams out after the rapidly disappearing silver bullet
he hears the growling sound of lester lowes coupe
he looks behind
roars toward the camera
he twists the throttle and the silver bullet responds
the director will shoot it as he likes the basis is simple lowe is chasing martys hopped up wheelchair along a country road at speeds approaching fifty mph
marty should have a couple of near misses and perhaps we could actually have him pass one car
at one point we should have a reverse angle on lester lowes coupe featuring two bumper stickers attend and support your local church and honk if you love as the
chase goes on it becomes apparent that lowe is gaining
marty looks increasingly desperate
and now he looks down at the needle is all the way over on e
sound of the coupes engine grows louder
lowe charges rapidly closing the distance
marty swerves from one side of the road to the other escaping lowe for the moment but almost overturning in the process
they are now running beside a river the auger river in fact
now the needle is actually past e
come on baby
his face registers hope as he sees he twists the throttle as far as it will turn hes going for broke
the coupe chases him and now the silver bullets motor coughs
its pretty ramshackle
a big orange sign beside it reads marty brakes hits the shoulder of the road and somehow makes the turn
we see him holding on for dear life as the silver bullet bounces and jounces down the dirt road to the mouth of the covered bridge
it overshoots the right turn marty just took screeches to a halt backs up and turns onto the lane
it bounces up the incline to the bridge motor coughing and it comes to a sliding dirt digging stop
his face is so full of frustrated hate that it has become the face of a gargoyle
its dim and spooky in here
cracks between the boards of the side walls allow dusty fingers of daylight to shine through
more light rays up from the cracks in the floor
the floorboards are warped and uneven martys wheelchair sways drunkenly from side to side
the total inside passage is about seventy feet
about halfway across the silver bullet coughs its last cough and splutters its last splutter
it rolls along silently going on its dying momentum
we hear the sounds of boards rumbling under the silver bullets tires and the auger river beneath
rolling ever more slowly the silver bullet approaches the camera
marty is covered with sweat
his hair is in a wild tangle
he looks at this is an extremely rustic lane
pretty but hardly the sort of place in which one would want to find oneself when one has a part time werewolf and a full time homicidal maniac close behind
lowe soft voice marty
martys head whips around
we see a brilliant square of light
in it stands lowes silhouette
the silhouette begins to move
sound of footfalls on the loose floorboards of the covered bridge
sensible black oxfords
im very sorry about this
i dont know if you believe that or not but its true
i would never willingly hurt a child
you should have left me alone marty
sound of footfalls resumes
hes nearly paralyzed with terror even if he wasnt he wouldnt get far in a powerless silver bullet
lowe soft soothing i cant kill myself marty
you see our religion teaches that suicide is the greatest sin a man or a woman can commit
stella randolph was going to commit suicide if she had done so she would be burning in hell right now
by killing her i took her physical life but saved her life eternal
you see marty
you see how all things serve the will and the mind of god
you see you meddling little shit
he begins to walk forward again
hes halfway across the bridge now walking slowly not hurrying
youre going to have a terrible accident marty
youre going to fall into the river
sound tractor engine
lowe stops alert to possible danger
martys face fills with hope
he looks from lowe toward the tractor sound gets louder still and here comes elmer zinneman on a john deere
the tractor is hauling a manure spreader which is mostly empty
marty waving madly mr
he draws back a little and his face is sharp with animal cunning inside his head hes running a four minute mile
stay and try to bluff it out or beat it
elmer draws the tractor up close to marty and swings it around
marty looks back at empty
marty looks back at elmer
i ran out of gas
spooky in there ennit
marty with feeling it sure is
he looks back once more toward brooding shadowy
camera holds and we marty is talking to uncle al
jane is behind them knocking croquet balls through the wickets on the back lawn
marty is looking at his uncle anxiously as jane strolls over
its a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws
also i checked on the otic solution
it was counter brand
no prescription needed
i told you
shut up dear boy no gloating allowed
jane sits down did you talk to the constable
after marty called me with his latest thrilling tale of wonder i did
pause hes had no poison pen complaints lodged at all
i told you
shut up marty
uncle al reluctantly theres something else
what is it
what other thing
i probably shouldnt tell you youre both hysterical on the subject
im starting to feel like a guy handing out free arthur murray coupons to victims of the dancing sickness
uncle al if you dont tell me he makes strangling gestures
uncle al reluctant i went out to that rest area
marty triumph you found the tracer
but i found some blood smeared on a tree trunk in that grove
it could have been anything marty
what about father lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down
you dont think that was a dream do you
uncle al comes over to janes side of the silver bullet
he looks down at theres a scrape and a dent where lowes coupe dented it
there is also a fleck of paint
three quarters full
the camera pans down to the tarkers mills town hall
uncle als sports car is parked out front
haller is behind his desk rocked back in his chair hands laced together behind his head
hes looking at uncle al
theres a silence that draws out for quite some time
in it uncle al becomes steadily more uncomfortable
thats just about the craziest damn story ive ever heard al
i could have edited out all of the completely crazy stuff but i thought you deserved to hear it with the bark on
i appreciate that
now the next question do you believe any of this
you do dont you
lets just say i believe lester lowe should be checked out
that can be arranged
they shake hands
a chevrolet with tarkers mills constable painted on the side in gold leaf pulls up
joe haller gets out and as he does theres a business of pulling his pants legs down over his boots nice stitched cowboy boots not black cops shoes
we want the audience to notice these boots remember them probably haller should wear them all through the picture
he goes up the walk
haller rings the doorbell
no one comes
haller rings the bell again
no one comes
he leans down and looks through a side window
no one there
he goes down the steps stands on the path for a moment and then goes over to the shed garage
he opens the door and looks in
lowes coupe is in there
theres just room for it amid the shadowy piles of bottles and cans
he goes around to the front of lowes coupe and squats down
in the b
a heaped mountain of aluminum beer and soda cans
haller feels in his breast pocket and brings out a zippo
he lights it and looks at one of the turn signal lamps is broken
theres a scratch in the paint and a dent in the bumper
hallers fingers come into the frame and touch the scratch
they stop and the camera zooms in to a small streak of silvery paint
as marty has a scrape of blue car paint on his wheelchair so does lowe have a scrape of silver wheelchair paint on his car
his eyes widen
sound shattering roar and the clink and tumble of about nine thousand cans as lowe erupts from under the aluminum scrap heap behind haller
he is a mixture of man and werewolf and quite clearly a beastial version of lowe
in one hand he holds the remains of owen knopflers peacemaker
haller starts to turn lowe strikes him with the bat
camera closes in on lowe as the bat rises and falls
rises and falls
we cant see haller and that is probably a mercy but we can hear the thud of the bat as it strikes again and again and again
uncle al has taken the coslaw family station wagon today
the three of them are sitting in the grove of trees
haller said hed check him out and guess what
no one sees him again
and what do you suggest i do about it dear boy
marty slips off his st
christophers medallion and hands it to uncle al
i want you to turn this into a silver bullet
youre not going to let it go are you
i saw what i saw
marty the moon wasnt even full
jane quietly in the made up stories the guy whos the werewolf only changes when the moon is full
but maybe hes really that way almost all the time only as the moon gets fuller
marty finishes the guy gets wolfier
jane hands al her crucifix here
take mine too
you dont have to do that
dont tell me what i have to do and what i dont booger brains
will you marry me jane
would you kids mind telling me how this guy lowe became a werewolf to begin with
i dont know
maybe he doesnt know either
no one knows how cancer begins either or exactly what it is but people still believe in it
the kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a jesuit
a french jesuit
i think hes going to come for me
not just because i know who he is but because i hurt him
only i dont think hell try again as lowe
dear boy you have gone right out of your mind
will you do it
uncle al only looks at him confused and unsure
uncle al is taking the kids home the camera tracks the wagon for a moment and then we are looking up the short lane and into a gravel pit
the camera zooms in fast on the sandy rear wall
we can see one cowboy boot sticking out of a wall of sand
its bloody and chewed
the wagon pulls in
please uncle al
cristophers medal and the crucifix are hanging from the rearview on a fine silver chain
uncle al takes down the medal and looks at it
i give up
thank you uncle al
if either of you ever tells anyone i even bought a piece of this story werewolves will be the least of your problems
uncle al pulls up to a city store front with a sign reading macs guns and ammo
he takes out the st
cristophers medal looks at it and shakes his head as if still ruing his own credulity and stupidity
he goes inside
jane voice over uncle als friend mac was more than a gunsmith he was uncle al said an old world craftsman a sort of wizard of weapons
in the gun shop interior we see uncle al talking to mac who really should look like an elderly white wizard a kind of gandalf figure
in the b
window we see a paper skeleton and paper jack o lanterns our first clue that all hallows eve is nearing
uncle al is speaking animatedly using his hands a lot we dont know exactly what the tale is but it must be a whopper
in the course of it he hands the medal and the crucifix to mac who tents the silver chains over his fingers and looks at them
jane v o continues god knows what sort of story my uncle told him but i think that for men who have been married as often as uncle al invention
on short notice becomes something of a specialty
in his workroom we see mac spilling boron over the medal and looking closely at the stain
jane v o continues the gunsmith confirmed the high grade silver content of my crucifix and martys medallion
in a dim shot which makes mac look more like a sorcerer than ever we see him light an acetylene torch and begin melting the medal and the crucifix in
the camera moves slowly in as janes contribution and martys melt together they are becoming on and indissoluble
jane v o continues melted them down
we see mac pouring molten silver into a bullet mold
jane v o concludes and molded them into a silver bullet
mac comes out of the back with a small inlaid wooden box
he puts it down on the glass counter top
here it is
macs hands open it disclosing a single bullet resting on dark velvet plush
it is a
short round and it gleams a pure silver
it would be great to hype this bullet optically not much just a little to make it look absolutely magical
uncle al picks up the bullet almost reverently holds it to the light
nicest piece of work i ever did i think
its got a low grain load so it wont tumble
should be pretty accurate
its just a gag thats all
what would you shoot a silver
bullet at anyway
mac joking how about a werewolf
pause happy halloween al
it nearly fills the screen swimming mysteriously in the warm summer air
jane voice over by the time martys silver bullet was done it was halloween
and the full moon had come around again
earlier that afternoon my grandfather who had been dying of cancer for over seven years finally finished the job
the camera pans down to the coslaw house
theres a carved jack in the window and a corsage of indian corn on the door
uncle als mg is in the driveway
the coslaw station wagon is just backing out
uncle al and jane stand in the doorway marty is slightly behind them in the silver bullet
nan leans out of the car
shes wearing black and she has obviously been crying
well be at the ritz carlton in boston tomorrow night
or at the funeral parlor
its stickney and and babcock i remember
now go on
the station wagon backs farther and nan leans out again
and dont open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come
the station wagon backs out into the road and nan pops out again
you kids go to bed on time
youve got school tomorrow
if you keep doing that youre going to bump your head sissy
give my love to mama tell her ill see her thursday
i will be good kids
the station wagon accelerates away
can i tell you kids something
sure uncle al
when me and sissy were kids we were just like you two
the bitch of it is we still are
learn from your elders dearies
he ushers them inside and closes the door
i cant believe that youd agree to leave the kids with him
a year ago i would have laughed at the idea
you used to almost breathe fire when al came in the house
just this summer
or somethings changed him
and the drinking i think its almost stopped
whatever it is its wonderful
and theyll be safe with him
im sure of it
i know theyll be safe with him
but will he get them both into bed by nine thirty
nan firmly if i told him to he will
sound the national anthem
the anthem finishes up
we go to a station id card
this concludes wdmls broadcast day
the tv goes to snow
shes mostly asleep in one corner
hes also dozing
he is also dozing
there are three or four empty beer cans in front of him and a cigarette with a long ash is smoldering between his fingers
pistol in his lap
the werewolf breaks from the woods and runs across the side yard to a line of high bushes that runs along the side of the house this is the opposite
side from martys bedroom
there is a space in here between the house and the bushes its like an animals run
the werewolf creeps along this its one eye flaring
uncle al jumps up and cries out as the cigarette burns up to his fingers
falls onto the rug
marty and jane also wake up startled
it recoils eyes gleaming
foam begins to drip from its jaws
it creeps slowly along toward a window
tv snow sounds uncle al is shaking his burned hand he picks the cigarette out of his lap and puts it out
jane sleepy youll burn yourself up sometime doing that uncle al
i suppose so
you kids ought to go up to bed
but uncle al
you said i know what i said marty but its ten past one
hes not coming
the moons not down yet
now ill sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because i promised but you two are going to bed
go on now scoot
jane gets up and starts toward the stairs
what if i say no
then id have to kick your ass dear boy
more kindly go on now
marty begins to roll the silver bullet toward the stairs where the stair chair awaits
jane is waiting for him at the living room doorway
marty sees the gun on the floor and stops
if thatd gone off it would have been the end of our silver bullet
he prickles a bit at the unstated criticism
he bends down and picks up the pistol
he opens the cylinder
five chambers are empty in one theres a bright silver circle
he pushes the cylinder plunger dropping the silver bullet into his hand
see dear boy
behind him the werewolfs head appears in the window its green eye flaring
marty looking toward uncle al sees nothing
jane is looking toward the window and she screams
jane shrieking its him
its the werewolf
i see him
shes pointing at the window
he jumps up and looks around at the window at this point al has the
with its cylinder open in one hand and the silver bullet loosely held in the other
nothing in the window but darkness
uncle al turns back to the kids
uncle al sharply you see it marty
marty shakes his head i was looking at you
his shoulders slump a little with relief now that the scare is over his relief is tempered with irritation
theyre just a couple of hysterical kids after all and jane is actually worse than marty
polly practical indeed
a very familiar feeling is beginning to creep over me
jane is crying
whats that uncle al
i feel like a horses ass
jane weeping i saw it uncle al
marty rolls a little closer to her and attempts to put a comforting arm around her shoulder
dont you touch me snotbrains
jane would you kids go to bed
my heads starting to ache
we see a clawed hairy hand reach into the frame and close around a thick wire
werewolf voice reeeal slow
the lights go out
jane its just a power fai hes starting toward her
at that moment most of the wall not just the window it was looking through before but the whole wall crashes inward as the werewolf bulls its way through roaring
uncle al whirls raising the pistol automatically to fire but the cylinder is rolled out and all the chambers are empty
he has time to register surprise before the werewolf smashes him aside
he goes flying backward
the pistol goes one way the silver bullet another
it spins into a living room corner
we see it rise in the air turning over and over
it comes down hits the floor and rolls
in the extreme f
is a heating vent
the bullet is rolling toward it
get the gun
he uses his hands to propel the ungainly silver bullet into the hall
the silver bullet rolls slowly toward the heating vent
in the b
we see a frantic marty in his wheelchair
he heaves himself out of it and falls full length grabbing
his fingers touch the bullet but thats all
it falls in the heating vent
its roaring furious its one eye flaring
uncle al lies senseless against one wall the front of his shirt bloody
jane runs into the corner and grabs the pistol
the werewolf picks up the easy chair and throws it through the hole it made coming in
it picks up an end table and hurls it through the tv
then it sees jane and starts toward her
comes toward her
she makes as if to run one way
its only a couple of feet from her now but again it is toying with her its making this reeeal slow
a bloodstained hand grabs a poker
as it tenses down to leap at her uncle al leaps at it and strikes it across the back
it turns roaring
uncle al hits it between the legs
it bellows and grabs the poker
it bends it and tosses it aside
the glaring savage expression on its face says that now it will bend uncle al and toss him aside
she breaks out of the corner and runs across the room toward the door
most of the way there she trips and falls
its head whips around
hes lying full length
hes got the heater vents grille off
one arm is down inside
marty scream janey
she tosses it awkwardly
it slides down the hall floor to marty like some strange awkward shuffleboard disc its cylinder still open
werewolf snarls maa aaa rty
it begins walking slowly across the living room smashing things out of its way
the gun slides into his hand
now he reaches into the heating duct again
theres an elbow bend just below martys twisting grasping fingers the silver bullet lies here
its less than half an inch out of reach
werewolf foaming maaa aaa rty
jane sobbing dont you hurt him
dont you hurt my brother
she bites one of the werewolfs hairy ankles as it passes
it roars with pain and kicks her aside
then it looks back into the hall
it is grinning
i believe it is thinking this is going to be better than a thanksgiving dinner you dont have to pay for
reeeal slow maa aaarty hes reaching desperately into the duct and staring at the approaching werewolf
martys fingers brush the bullet once
he rolls over on his back and sticks the silver bullet blindly into one chamber of the cylinder and slams the cylinder closed
he points the gun and pulls the trigger
theres only a click
an expression of dismay on his face
he drags himself so hes half propped against the hall wall
he pulls the trigger again
dismay becomes fear
its reached the silver bullet
it smashes it aside
the bullet hits the wall
holding the gun in both hands now he pulls the trigger a third time
the werewolfs shadow falls over him
it bends down reaching
craning back as if to drive himself into the wall he pulls the trigger again
the bullet flies from the barrel gleaming silver
the silver bullet strikes him in his one remaining eye
he flies backward hands clapped to his gushing face
and crashes into martys silver bullet wheelchair
it sits there roaring
and then it begins to change
she lies there sobbing
uncle al voice you okay janey
uncle al is bloody and staggering but on his feet
he helps jane up
im all right
ma its hands drop from its face
it is now blind in both eyes it is half werewolf and half lowe
it bellows again convulses
marty calls im all right
heres a creature that is mostly father lowe collapsed in the remains of martys wheelchair beyond it marty is lying on the floor
uncle al goes by the corpse
jane starts by
and lowe sits bolt upright for a moment grasping blindly at her
she shrieks and darts aside
lowe falls back now really dead
until the sequel
uncle al puts a comforting arm around jane who is sobbing again hell id be sobbing after that last one myself and draws her down beside himself and marty
uncle al to marty there
i told you there werent any such things as werewolves
they smile at each other with love
jane nervous are you sure its dead
or whatever it is
if it isnt now it will be after i pound one of your mothers silver candlesticks through its heart
jane grimaces oh uncle al no
uncle al grim oh yes janey
when i believe something i believe it all the way
he gets up and leaves
are you all right marty
all except my legs
i dont think i can walk
youre a real booger you know it
marty smiles i love you jane
jane voice over it wasnt always easy for me to answer that
but i could answer it that night and i find i can say it now that the terrible events of that fall have receded to memories which seem little more
than dreams in my mind
jane hugging him i love you marty
jane voice over no more than a whisper i love you marty
the camera pans up to the full moon
