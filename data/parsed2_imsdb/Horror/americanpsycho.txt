href b b american psycho by mary harron and guinevere turner by mary harron and guinevere turner based on the novel by bret easton ellis fourth draft november an insanely
expensive restaurant on the upper east side
the decor is a mixture of chi chi and rustic with swagged silk curtains handwritten menus and pale pink tablecloths decorated with arrangements of moss twigs and hideous exotic flowers
the clientele is young wealthy and confident dressed in the height of late eighties style pouffy lacroix dresses slinky alaia armani power suits
close up on a waiter reading out the specials
with goat cheese profiteroles and i also have an arugula caesar salad
for entrees tonight i have a swordfish meatloaf with onion marmalade a rare roasted partridge breast in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale
huge white porcelain plates descend on very pale pink linen table cloths
each of the entrees is a rectangle about four inches square and look exactly alike
close up on various diners as we hear fragments of conversation
is that charlie sheen over there
i ordered cactus pear sorbet
and grilled free range rabbit with herbed french fries
our pasta tonight is a squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth
close up on porcelain plates containing elaborate perpendicular desserts descending on another table
patrick bateman timothy price craig mcdermott and david van patten are at a table set for four
they are all wearing expensively cut suits and suspenders and have slicked back hair
van patten wears horn rimmed glasses
the camera moves in on bateman as his narration begins were sitting in pastels this nouvelle northern california place on the upper east side
the waiter sets down plates containing tiny elaborately decorated starters
as he does so we hear batemans description of each of the men at the table
youll notice that my friends and i all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion but there are subtle differences between us
mcdermott is the biggest asshole
van patten is the yes man
price is the most wired
im the best looking
we all have light tans
right now im in a bad mood because this is not a good table and van patten keeps asking dumb obvious questions about how to dress
what are the rules for a sweater vest
mcdermott what do you mean
mcdermott well is it strictly informal or can it be worn with a suit
mcdermott smiling exactly with discreet pinstripes you should wear a subdued blue or charcoal gray vest
a plaid suit would cal i for a bolder vest
mcdermott but avoid matching the vests pattern with your socks or tie
wearing argyle socks with an argyle vest will look too studied
you think so
youll look like you consciously worked for the look
excuse me gentlemen
van patten leaves the table
as he does so a busboy discreetly removes their largely untouched plates
van patten looks puffy
has he stopped working out
it looks that way doesnt it
mcdermott staring at retreating waiter did he just take our plates away
he took them away because the portions are so small he probably thought we were finished
god i hate this place
this is a chicks restaurant
why arent we at dorsia
mcdermott because bateman wont give the maitre d head
he guffaws bateman throws a swizzle stick at him
mcdermott scans the room settling on a handsome young man with slicked back hair and horn rimmed glasses
mcdermott is that reed robinson over there
are you freebasing or what
thats not robinson
mcdermott who is it then
thats paul owen
thats not paul owen
paul owens on the other side of the room
he points to another handsome young man with slicked back hair and horn rimmed glasses
mcdermott who is he with
distracted by the waitresss cleavage as she bends over to uncork a bottle of wine the waitress glares at him some weasel from kicker peabody
van patten returns
they dont have a good bathroom to do coke in
mcdermott are you sure thats paul owen over there
mcdufus i am
mcdermott hes handling the fisher account
mcdermott lucky jew bastard
oh jesus mcdermott what does that have to do with anything
ive seen the bastard sitting in his office on the phone with ceos spinning a fucking menorah
the bastard brought a hanukkah bush into the office last december
you spin a dreidel mcdermott not a menorah
you spin a dreidel
mcdermott oh my god
bateman do you want me to fry you up some fucking potato pancakes
just cool it with the anti semitic remarks
mcdermott oh i forgot
batemans dating someone from the price leans over and pats bateman on the back
the voice of reason
the boy next door
and speaking of reasonable
he shows mcdermott the bill for the meal
without irony not bad
the others murmur agreement
four platinum amex cards slap down on the table
bateman is pouring vintage champagne into flutes
price is lighting up a cigar
mcdermott last week i picked up this vassar chick oh god i was there
i dont need to hear this story again
mcdermott but i never told you what happened afterwards
so okay i pick up this vassar chick at tunnel hot number big tits great legs this chick was a little hardbody and so i buy her a couple of
champagne kirs and shes in the city on spring break and shes practically blowing me in the chandelier room and so i take her back to my place whoa wait

price throws a cigar at mcdermott who catches it
mcdermott anyway so were back at my place and listen to this
shes had enough champagne by now to get a fucking rhino tipsy and get this she let you fuck her without a condom
mcdermott this is a vassar girl
shes not from queens
she would only are you ready
dramatic pause she would only give me a handjob and get this
she kept her glove on
the men sit in shocked horrified silence
all in unison never date a vassar girl
the limo pulls up to the sidewalk outside the tunnel
mcdermott holds the door open for a passing homeless man who looks confused
mcdermott i suppose he doesnt want the car
price ask him if he takes american express
offering card you take amex dude
the man stumbles away
the club doorman seeing the limousine unhooks the velvet rope and welcomes them inside
brilliant white light a bemused elderly female attendant in a black and white maids uniform trying to give out paper towels
music thuds through an open doorway
trashed looking girls stare into mirrors repairing their eye make up or sit on the counter chatting to friends
there are almost as many men as women in the room
couples stand in line twitching as they wait to do coke
as soon as one bathroom door opens a couple lurches out rubbing their noses while another couple rushes past them and slams the door
theres this theory out now that if you can catch the aids virus through having sex with someone who is infected then you can also catch anything alzheimers muscular dystrophy
hemophilia leukemia diabetes dyslexia for christs sake you can get dyslexia from pussy im not sure guy but i dont think dyslexia is a virus
oh who knows
they dont know that
price and bateman finally get a stall and rush in
price is sweating
you open it
bateman opens a tiny packet of coke
thats not a helluva lot is it
maybe its just the light
is he fucking selling it by the milligram
he dips the corner of his amex card in the packet and takes a snort oh my god
its a fucking milligram of sweetn low
bateman dips his amex in the envelope and snorts
its definitely weak but i have a feeling if we do enough of it well be okay
i want to get high off this bateman not sprinkle it on my fucking all bran
the guy in stall next door yells at them in an effeminate voice could you keep it down im trying to do drugs
price pounds his fist against the stall
screaming calm down
lets do it anyway i guess youre right
raising his voice fuck you
trying to climb up against the aluminum divider no fuck you
he collapses panting against the stall door sorry dude
okay lets do it
thats the spirit
they both dig their platinum amex cards into the envelope of white powder shoveling it up their noses then sticking their fingers in to catch the residue and rubbing it
into their gums
bateman saunters toward the bar as pump up the volume plays in the background
bateman to bargirl two stoli on the rocks
he hands her two drink tickets
its after eleven
those arent good anymore
its a cash bar
thatll be twenty five dollars
bateman pulls out an expensive looking wallet and hands her a
she turns her back and searches the cash register for change
bateman you are a fucking ugly bitch i want to stab to death and then play around with your blood
the music muffles his voice
she turns around
he is smiling at her
she gives him his change impassively
tableaux of batemans apartment in the early morning light
a huge white living room with floor to ceiling windows looking out over manhattan decorated in expensive minimalist high style bleached oak floors a huge white sofa a large baselitz
painting hung upside down and much expensive electronic equipment
the room is impeccably neat and oddly impersonal as if it had sprung straight from the pages of a design magazine
my name is patrick bateman
i am twenty six years old
i live in the american garden buildings on west eighty first street on the eleventh floor tom cruise lives in the penthouse
bateman walks into his bathroom urinates while trying to see his reflection in a poster for les miserables above his toilet
i believe in taking care of myself in a balanced diet in a rigorous exercise routine
in the morning if my face is a little puffy ill put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches
i can do a thousand now
bateman ties a plastic ice pack around his face
bateman does his morning stretching exercises in the living room wearing the ice pack
a mirror lined bathroom
bateman is luxuriating in the shower steam scrubbing his body admiring his muscles
after i remove the icepack i use a deep pore cleanser lotion
in the shower i use a water activated gel cleanser then a honey almond body scrub and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub
bateman stands in front of a massive marble sink applying a gel facial masque
then i apply an herb mint facial masque which i leave on for ten minutes while i prepare the rest of my routine
bateman opens the door of a mirrored cabinet which is stocked with immaculate rows of skin care products
he begins selecting bottles jars and brushes laying them in readiness on the marble counter
i always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older
then moisturizer then an anti aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion
bateman stares into the mirror
the masque has dried giving his face a strange distorted look as if it has been wrapped in plastic
he begins slowly peeling the gel masque off his face
there is an idea of a patrick bateman some kind of abstraction hut there is no real me only an entity something illusory and though i can hide my cold
gaze and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping you and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable i simply am not there
another huge white room equally minimal a futon rumpled white sheets a bedside lamp with a halogen bulb and a large expensive painting eric fischl or david salle chosen by
batemans interior decorator
dressed in silk boxer shorts bateman stands in front of a huge walk in closet filled with rows of expensive shirts shoes and designer suits organized according to color and
it is hard for me to make sense on any given level
my self is fabricated an aberration
my personality is sketchy and unformed my heartlessness goes deep and is persistent
fully dressed in armani bateman stands in front of a full length mirror in the middle of his vast bedroom adjusting his cuff links
my conscience my pity my hopes disappeared a long time ago if they ever did exist
he gives a last look at the mirror and likes what he sees
he gives his reflection a smile
as bateman walks down the corridor he passes another man who looks just like him
bateman walks past the desk of jean his secretary pulling his walkman from around his neck
jean is attractive wholesome earnest
she smiles shyly
she loves him
ricky hendricks has to cancel today
he didnt say what he was canceling or why
i occasionally box with ricky at the harvard club
spencer wants to meet you for a drink at fluties pier
jean follows him into his office
and what should i say
just say no
jean stands at his desk waiting for instructions
i need reservations for three at camols at twelve thirty and if not there try crayons
playfully yes sir
she turns to leave
and i need reservations for two at arcadia at eight tonight
jean turns around
ill make them
ill do it
be a doll and just get me a perrier okay
you look nice today
bateman straightens some magazines in his office lifts a painting off the wall and puts it back at a slightly different angle
he fiddles with some pencils in a beer stein
he puts on some music and flips through a sports illustrated
he buzzes jean
she comes in a moment later with the perrier and a file
is that the ransom file
dont wear that outfit again
i didnt hear you
i said do not wear that outfit again
wear a dress
a skirt or something
jean stands there then looks down at herself
smiling bravely you dont like this i take it
come on youre prettier than that
sarcastically thanks patrick
the phone rings and jean turns to leave
im not here
and high heels
i like high heels
as jean leaves bateman clicks on the tv set in one corner of the room and starts watching jeopardy
evelyn williams patrick batemans fiancee is making notes with a gold cross pen and sipping a bottle of mineral water
evelyn is blonde classically beautiful expensively educated and utterly pleased with herself
she usually addresses patrick as if he were a small child
id want a zydeco band patrick
thats what id want a zydeco band
something ethnic to shock daddy oh i cant decide
and lots of chocolate truffles
and oysters on the halfshell
close up on bateman who is wearing a walkman and staring out the window
im trying to listen to the new george michael tape but evelyn my supposed fiancee keeps buzzing in my ear
evelyn continues to make notes
hundreds thousands of roses
well get annie leibovitz
and well hire someone to videotape
patrick we should do it
removing his walkman do
have a wedding
is your evian spiked
we should do it
no i cant take the time off work
your father practically owns the company
you can do anything you like silly
i dont want to talk about it
well you hate that job anyway
why dont you just quit
you dont have to work
the taxi bumps to a halt
a cavernous garage harshly spot lit decorated in self conscious brutalist chic
iron girders walls of waxed plaster featuring exposed rusted pipes a huge schnabel smashed plate painting on one wall
the tables and chairs are made of extremely uncomfortable bolted steel
im on the verge of tears by the time we arrive at espace since im positive we wont have a decent table but we do and relief washes over me
in an awesome wave
tm price and two downtown types stash and vanden are already seated
vanden is about twenty pretty and sullen with green streaks in her black hair
stash is pale with ragged black hair and bad skin
they are all trying to read large stainless steel menus that look like minimalist art
the menus in braille
he gets up to greet them giving evelyn a suspiciously long kiss
i have to talk to you
he drags her away half giggling and protesting
over her shoulder pat this is my cousin vanden and her boyfriend stash
hes an artist
after smiling at his own reflection in the mirror and checking his hair hi
vanden takes his hand reluctantly says nothing
let me guess you live in the east village
courtney rawlinson and luis carruthers arrive at the table
courtney is blonde classically beautiful and from precisely the same social background as evelyn but she is considerably more fragile and neurotic
luis is half english half argentinean slightly overweight a rarity in this crowd puppyish and eager to please
he wears the same type of designer clothes as price and bateman but with foppish tendencies velvet jackets bow ties boldly patterned vests
they exchange air kisses
as soon as luis turns his back bateman sneaks a kiss on courtneys neck
whispering stop it
stash and vanden watch them in silence
price is whispering in evelyns ear
everyone else is quietly eating except bateman who is drinking and watching evelyn and price
i am fairly sure that timothy and evelyn are having an affair
timothy is the only interesting person i know
courtney is almost perfect looking
she s usually operating on one or more psychiatric drugs
tonight i believe its xanax
more disturbing than her drug use though is the fact that shes engaged to luis carruthers the biggest dufus in the business
courtney rouses herself from her drug haze
do you think soho is becoming to
yes i read that
oh who gives a rats ass
that affects us
wired on coke oh ho ho
that affects us
what about the massacres in sri lanka honey
doesnt that affect us too
i mean dont you know anything about sri lanka
about how the sikhs are killing like tons of israelis there
doesnt that affect us
oh come on
there are a lot more important problems than sri lanka to worry about
sure our foreign policy is important but there are more pressing problems at hand
well we have to end apartheid for one
and slow down the nuclear arms race stop terrorism and world hunger
but we cant ignore our social needs
either we have to stop people from abusing the welfare system
we have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws
to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain womens freedom of choice
the table stares at bateman uncomfortably
we also have to control the influx of illegal immigrants
we have to encourage a return to traditional moral values and curb graphic sex and violence on tv in movies in pop music everywhere
most importantly we have to promote general social concern and less materialism in young people
price chokes on his drink
everyone is silent and mystified
patrick how thought provoking
bateman and evelyn are lying on her bed watching television
why don t you just go for price
oh god patrick
hes good looking
everybodys good looking patrick
he has a great body everybody has a great body now
bateman unbuttons his shirt and makes advances to get evelyn to have sex with him
she ignores him watching the home shopping channel with the remote in her hand
finally he straddles her penis close to her face
she tries to look around him at the tv then takes notice
what do you want to do with that floss with it
bateman flops back down beside her and stares at the television
are you using minoxidil
why should i
your hairline looks like its receding
it is a
bateman is standing at an atm listening to the comforting sound of fresh bills thudding out of the machine
bateman turns around and watches a solitary young woman walk past him
he collects his money placing it carefully in his wallet and then walks toward her whistling
he catches up to her as she pauses at a red light
the woman looks suspicious for a moment and then seeing his smile smiles back
bateman dressed in an armani suit with an unlit cigar between his teeth is standing in a dry cleaners arguing with the chinese woman behind the counter
youre not giving me valid reasons
the woman continues to speak to him in another language grabbing at the sleeve of the jacket
what are you trying to say to me
her husband has taken batemans horribly bloodstained sheets out of the bag and is staring at them
are you trying to say bleach ee
oh my god
she keeps pointing to the jacket and talking
talking over her two things
you cant bleach a soprani
out of the question
i can only get these sheets in santa fe
these are very expensive sheets and i really need them clean
she keeps talking and bateman leans into her
if you dont shut your fucking mouth i will kill you are you understanding me
she talks faster
now listen i have a very important lunch meeting checks rolex at huberts in thirty minutes and i need those no wait twenty minutes
i have a lunch meeting at huberts in twenty minutes with ronald harrison and i need those sheets cleaned by this afternoon
she keeps talking
i cannot understand you
bateman starts laughing slaps his hand down on the counter
this is crazy
youre a fool
i cant cope with this
bateman is on the verge of tears
someone enters the store behind him
its victoria late twenties attractive but a little overweight wearing a tailored business suit with white sneakers and sports socks
she takes off her sunglasses
i thought that was you
hello mumbles un incomprehensible name awkward pause
isnt it ridiculous
coming all the way up here but you know
they really are the best
then why cant they get these stains out
i mean can you talk to these people or something
im not getting anywhere
victoria moves toward the sheet that the old man is holding up
she touches it and the woman behind the counter begins talking again
oh my i see
what are those

victoria skeptically really
well i mean um it s really
you know like

its a dove bar
as if sharing a secret joke oh yeah
oh i get it

listen if you could talk to them he yanks the sheet out of the mans hand i would really appreciate it

bateman turns to leave

oh cant im afraid

listen ive really got to go

bateman glares at the woman behind the counter and rushes out the door
victoria stares after him as we hear the sound of the bell on the closing door
bateman is sitting on the sofa watching a video talking to courtney on a portable phone
hes holding a video box in one hand perusing the title inside lydias ass
offscreen we hear the sounds of the porn movie as he talks
listen what are you doing tonight
listen youre dating luis hes in arizona
youre fucking me and we havent made plans
what could you possibly be up to tonight
on a lot of lithium
waiting for luis to call me
he said hed call tonight
oh dont be difficult patrick

pumpkin youre dating an asshole

pumpkin youre dating a tumbling tumbling dickweed
patrick dont call me pumpkin anymore okay

the question is do you like it courtney
and will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight
pick me up
sounds like ill have to
dont fall asleep okay
wear something fabulous
bateman hangs up opens up the zagats guide and dials the number for dorsia with trembling fingers
its busy and so he puts it on speakerphone constant redial
he waits with his head in his hands sweating with anxiety until there is finally an answer
he is on hold for a long time getting very tense
both of his eyes are closed umm
i know its a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight thirty perhaps
the maitre d starts giggling quietly and then more loudly until the laughter is almost hysterical and he hangs up the phone
bateman and courtney are in the back of a cab
courtney is heavily medicated
a facial at elizabeth arden which was really relaxing then to the pottery bam where i bought this silver muffin dish
she starts to pass out is that donald trumps car
thickly oh god patrick
you know courtney you should take some more lithium
or have a diet coke
some caffeine might get you out of this slump
i just want to have a child
her voice trails as she descends back into a drug haze the cab draws up outside a restaurant
the awning reads barcadia
an insanely expensive nouvelle italian restaurant all polished natural brick spotless white tablecloths minimalist flower arrangements discreet lighting
a waiter has come to take their drink orders
champagne on the rocks
oh could i have that with a twist
she starts to sink back in her chair and bateman leans over and pulls her back up
are we here
this is dorsia
examining a menu that says barcadia in large script yes dear
courtney almost falls asleep while looking at her menu and starts to slide off of her chair
bateman grabs her by both shoulders and props her up
courtney youre going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash
new york magazine called it a playful but mysterious little dish
youll love it
the red snapper with violets and pine nuts
i think thatll follow nicely
she falls asleep at the table
bateman and courtney are in courtneys bed
bateman is on top of her reaching for a condom in the ashtray
he tears it open with his teeth puts it on
dazed on lithium i want you to fuck me
bateman gets on top of her starts to fuck her
luis is a despicable twit
yes luis is a despicable twit
i hate him
he keeps fucking her
no you idiot
i said is it a receptacle tip
not is luis a despicable twit
is it a receptacle tip
get off me
is it a what
im ignoring you
screaming pull out goddamnit
slowing down but not stopping what do you want courtney
she pushes him away from her
its a plain end
turn the light on
she tries to sit up
im going home
turn on the light
he turns on the light
its a plain end see
take it off
because you have to leave half an inch at the tip she covers herself with her comforter to catch the force of the ejaculate
im getting out of here
wheres your lithium
courtney throws a pillow over her head and starts crying
screaming do you think youre turning me on by having unsafe sex
bateman pulls the pillow off her and slaps her face
oh christ this really isnt worth it
and see courtney its there for what
he slaps her again lightly why is it pulled down half an inch
so it can catch the force of the ejaculate
choking crying well its not a turn on for me
i have a promotion coming to me
i dont want to get aids
bateman grabs her head and makes her look at the condom
you dumb bitch
are you happy you dumb bitch
oh god just get it over with
he fucks her quickly until he has a mediocre orgasm and falls down next to her
they lie side by side with their bodies not touching eyes open staring at the ceiling
bateman and luis carruthers are seated at a long table in the conference room at pierce pierce which looks out onto a spectacular view of manhattan
patrick thanks so much for looking after courtney
dorsia how impressive
how on earth did you get a reservation there
lucky i guess
thats a wonderful jacket
let me guess valentino couture
reaching out to touch it it looks so soft
catching luis hand your compliment was sufficient luis
carruthers is distracted by a question from the colleague on his left
paul owen enters carrying the wall st
journal under his arm
he is handsome supremely confident and self satisfied he sees himself as a leader among men
to bateman hello halberstam
how the hell are you
ive been great
their conversation fades down as we hear batemans thoughts
owen has mistaken me for this dickhead marcus halberstam
it seems logical because marcus also works at p p and in fact does the same exact thing i do and he also has a penchant for valentino suits and
oliver peoples glasses
marcus and i even go to the same barber although i have a slightly better haircut
during this voiceover the camera wanders over to marcus halberstam who is conferring with a colleague in the opposite corner of the room
he bears a superficial resemblance to bateman
hows the ransom account going marcus
he stares at bateman smiling not great
oh well you know
and hows cecilia
shes a great girl
im very lucky
mcdermott and price enter
congratulations on the fisher account
thank you baxter
hands him a business card how about friday
no can do
got a res at eight thirty at dorsia
great sea urchin ceviche
there is a stunned silence as he walks away and sits in a corner of the room ostentatiously studying papers
close up on batemans face cold with hatred
on a friday night
howd he swing that
mcdermott whispering i think hes lying
bateman takes out his wallet and pulls out a card
suddenly enthused whats that a gram
what do you think
mcdermott lifts it up and examines the lettering carefully
take a look
he hands it to van patten
picked them up from the printers yesterday good coloring
and the lettering is something called silian rail
mcdermott envious silian rail
it is very cool bateman
but thats nothing
he pulls a card out of his wallet and slaps it on the table
look at this
they all lean forward to inspect it
thats really nice
bateman clenches his fists beneath the table trying to control his anxiety
eggshell with romalian type
turning to bateman what do you think
barely able to breath his voice a croak nice
holding the card up to the light jesus
this is really super
howd a nitwit like you get so tasteful
bateman stares at his own card and then enviously at mcdermotts
i cant believe that price prefers mcdermotts card to mine
you aint seen nothin yet
he holds up his own card
raised lettering pale nimbus white
choking with anxiety impressive
lets see paul owens card
price pulls a card from an inside coat pocket and holds it up for their inspection paul owen pierce pierce mergers and acquisitions
bateman swallows speechless
the sound in the room dies down and all we hear is a faint heartbeat as bateman stares at the magnificent card
look at that subtle off white coloring
the tasteful thickness of it
oh my god it even has a watermark
his hand shaking bateman lifts up the card and stares at it until it fills the screen
he lets it fall
the sound returns to normal
carruthers is something wrong
the financial district
the streets are eerily deserted
bateman stands at an atm enjoying the reassuring sound of in fresh bills thudding from the machine
as he turns to leave he notices someone across the street
a homeless man is lying in a doorway on top of an open grate surrounded by bags of garbage and a shopping cart
a cardboard sign is attached to the front of the cart i am homeless and hungry please help me
a small thin dog lies next to him
he is black dressed in a stained torn lime green polyester pants suit with jeans worn over the pants
offering his hand hello
the homeless man stares at bateman struggling to sit up
you want some money
the homeless man nods and starts to cry
bateman reaches into his pocket and pulls out a i bill then changes his mind and holds out a instead
is this what you need
the homeless man nods looks away wipes his nose
im so hungry
its cold out too isnt it
im so hungry
holding the bill just out of the mans reach why dont you get a job
if youre so hungry why dont you get a job
shivering and sobbing i lost my job
were you drinking
is that why you lost it
no really were you drinking on the job
homeless man i was fired
i was laid off
gee uh thats too bad
im so hungry
the dog starts to whimper
why dont you get another one
why dont you get another job
youre not what
qualified for anything else
im hungry i know that i know that
jeez youre like a broken record
im trying to help you
listen do you think its fair to take money from people who do have jobs
from people who do work

youve got to get your act together
ill help you

im so cold
stroking his face whispering do you know how bad you smell
the stench my god
i cant find a shelter you reek
you reek of
do you know that
shouting goddammit al look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot
bateman carefully puts the money back in his wallet
its just that
i dont know i dont have anything in common with you
he opens his briefcase and pulls out a long thin knife with a serrated edge
he pushes up the sleeve of his jacket to protect it
do you know what a fucking loser you are
homeless mans pov as bateman lunges at him with the knife
extreme wide shot of the street
batemans shadowed figure is hunched over the homeless man stabbing him in the stomach
the dog barks wildly and bateman stomps on it until it is silent
low angle shot of bateman as he throws a quarter on the ground
theres a quarter
go buy some gum
bateman walks calmly into the empty caverns of wall street
cars drift past their headlights momentarily illuminating the body left twitching on the ground
close up on batemans face and torso
his eyes are closed as a womans hands rub cream into his face
what beautiful skin you have mr bateman
so fine so smooth
his eyes open to look up at the facialist and then he closes them again
i have all the characteristics of a human being flesh blood skin hair but not a single clear identifiable emotion except for greed und disgust
something horrible is happening inside me and i dont know why
bateman sitting in a chair looking down at the manicurist who is giving him a pedicure
she is cutting his nails with tiny sharp scissors
he stares at them longingly
my nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my days
i feel lethal on the verge of frenzy
bateman lying irradiated by ultraviolet light on a tanning bed wearing goggles
i think my mask of sanity is about to slip
an insanely expensive nouvelle tex mex restaurant with an ironic southwestern decor santa fe colors navajo blankets naive cowboy art rawhide banquettes
bateman bursts in the door late and approaches the maitre d
for two at eight
your friend has already been seated
follow me mr
paul owen is seated at a table underneath an enormous pair of rams horns
he is arguing with the waiter
no i want to know
i came here for the cilantro crawfish gumbo which is after all the only excuse one could have for being in this restaurant which is by the way almost completely
am i to believe that all ten people in this restaurant have eaten your entire supply of cilantro crawfish gumbo
im very sorry sir
there was a fire in the kitchen earlier today and j b straight
and a dixie beer
would you like to hear double absolut martini
would you like to hear the specials
not if you want to keep your spleen
the waiter leaves
this is a real beehive of uh activity halberstam
this place is hot very hot
listen the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here
yeah well youre late
hey im a child of divorce
give me a break studying the menu hes in a surprisingly good mood hmmm i see theyve omitted the pork loin with lime jello
we shouldve gone to dorsia
i couldve gotten us a table
nobody goes there anymore
there is a long disgruntled silence
is that ivana trump over there
laughs jeez patrick i mean marcus what are you thinking
why would ivana be at texarkana
so wasnt rothschild originally handling the fisher account
how did you get it
i could tell you that halberstam but then id have to kill you
bateman laughs politely
paul owen is very drunk
bateman cold sober
i like to dissect girls
did you know im utterly insane
owen continues laughing and motions to the waiter for another drink
great tan marcus
where do you tan
ive got a tanning bed at home
you should look into it
bateman nods agitated
and cecelia how is she
where is she tonight
cecelia is well
you know cecelia
i think shes having dinner with
goes out with that loser patrick bateman
what a dork
another martini paul
owen nods drunkenly
the end of the meal
owen is squeezing a lime onto the table missing his beer incredibly drunk
the check is laid down
talking to owen like a child paul give me your amex card
bateman slaps the card down looks at the check
two hundred and fifty
lets leave a big tip shall we
my place hr a nightcap
im gonna bail
come on you dumb son of a bitch
helping him into his jacket ive got a preview of the barneys catalogue and a bottle of absolut waiting for us
the living room floor has been meticulously covered with newspaper
owen is slumped drunkenly in a white eames chair a glass in his hand
bateman is looking through his cds
you like huey lewis and the news
their early work was a little too new wave for my taste
but then sports came out in i think they really came into their own commercially and artistically
bateman walks to his bathroom taking a large ax out of the shower
he takes two valium
said partly from the bathroom the whole album has a clear crisp sound and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that gives the songs a big boost
bateman comes back out and leans the ax against the wall
he walks to the foyer and puts on a raincoat watching owen from behind ail the time
hes been compared to elvis costello but i think huey has a more bitter cynical sense of humor
owen is absent mindedly leafing through the barneys catalogue
why are there copies of the style section all over the place
do you have a dog
a chow or something
confused is that a raincoat
yes it is
bateman moves to the cd player
he takes a cd out of its case and slides it in the machine
in huey released this fore
their most accomplished album
i think i heir undisputed masterpiece is hip to be square a song so catchy that most people probably dont listen to the lyrics
but they should because its not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends
its al a personal statement about the band itself
bateman puts on hip to be square
bateman crosses the room and picks up the ax
we follow bateman from behind as he walks up to owen the ax raised over his head
as owen turns around from owens pov we see bateman swing the ax toward his face
blood sprays onto the white raincoat
from behind owen we see bateman as he yanks the ax out
owen drops to the floor
his body falls out of the frame
we stay on his legs twitching mechanically
blood pulses onto the newspaper covered floor
raising the ax and screaming try getting a reservation at dorsia now you fucking stupid bastard
low angle on bateman as he beats owen with the back of the ax
offscreen the sound of the ax hitting owen
panting fucking bastard
bateman takes his raincoat off still panting
he folds the coat carefully in half bloody side in and drapes it neatly over the back of a chair
he sits back on the white sofa and surveys the scene
he checks his rolex and lights a cigar
offscreen paul owens last faint sighs are heard
bateman drags a large blood soaked sleeping bag through the lobby past the bored doorman who looks up from the post for a moment
bateman is trying to hail a cab
owens body is at his feet
luis carruthers and a japanese girl walk up to him
is that you
its not me
this is gwendolyn ichiban
this is my very good friend patrick bateman
where are you going
were going to nells
gwendolyns fathers buying it
looking down at the body where did you get your overnight bag
commes des garcon
a cab stops
bateman opens the door and manages to get owens body into the backseat
bateman gets into the cab
call me please patrick
jesus lives luis
a bare room lit by one light bulb
the walls are blank except for a les miserables poster
there is one ratty chair
bateman pours lime over paul owens body which is lying in a bathtub
he plays huey lewis smokes a cigar watches the body dissolve
bateman is letting himself into the apartment
it is very similar to batemans but even more minimalist
the walls are white pigmented concrete with a large minimalist painting on the wall
one wall is covered in a trendy large scale scientific drawing above a long black leather couch
where to send the bastard
he throws some clothes into a suitcase randomly grabbing toiletries and shoving them in
ill send the asshole to london
he puts some music on to help muffle his voice then leans over the answering machine
he does a passable imitation of owens speech
hi this is paul
ive been called away to london for a few days
meredith ill call you when i get back
hasta la vista baby
bateman is sitting at his desk with the latest copy of sports illustrated in front of him and his walkman playing kenny g
we hear the music until jean enters and he takes the walkman off
faintly irritable what is it
condescendingly ye es je an
patrick a mr
donald kimball is here to see you
detective donald kimball
bateman stares out the window then down at the drawing of a headless woman hes been doodling on the back cover of sports illustrated
tell him im at lunch
whispering patrick i think he knows youre here
its only ten thirty
send him in i guess
as she exits he picks up the cordless phone and pretends to talk to someone at the other end
now john youve got to wear clothes in proportion to your physique
there are definite dos and donts good buddy of wearing a bold striped shirt
a hold striped shirt calls for solid colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties
the door to the office opens and he waves in detective donald kimball
kimball is surprisingly young about batemans age and good looking dressed in a crumpled linen armani suit of the type bateman and his friends might wear
kimball sits down and crosses his legs with a self assurance that makes bateman so nervous he forgets to carry on with his fake conversation
kimball looks up at him curiously noticing the silence
realizing that kimball is staring at him right
always tip the stylist fifteen percent
bateman shrugs at the detective rolling his eyes in exasperation
kimball nods understandingly
listen john ive got to go
t boone pickens just walked in
he laughs inanely just joking
pause no dont tip the owner of the salon
okay john right got it
he hangs up the phone and pushes the antenna in sorry about that
no im sorry
i shouldve made an appointment
gesturing toward the phone was that anything important
just mulling over business problems
they laugh politely
holding out his hand hi
im donald kimball shaking firmly hi
nice to meet you
im sorry to barge in on you like this
but i was supposed to talk to luis carruthers and he wasnt in and
well youre here so
i know how busy you guys can get
kimball stares at the three open copies of sports illustrated and the sony walkman lying on batemans desk
bateman sees the look and sweeps the magazines into the top drawer along with the walkman which is still running
forcing himself to sound friendly and relaxed so whats the topic of discussion
ive been hired by meredith powell to investigate the disappearance of paul owen
youre not with the fbi or anything are you
nothing like that
im just a private investigator
ah i see
so its nothing that official
i just have some basic questions
about paul owen
about yourself coffee
no im okay
kimball takes out a small black notepad and the same gold cross pen that bateman and his friends all use
bateman buzzes jean
can you bring mr
kimball a bottle of san pelle oh no im okay
its no problem bateman watches intently as kimball writes something down in his notebook then crosses something out
jean enters and places the bottle of san pellegrino and a steuben etched glass on the table shooting a concerned glance at bateman
he glares at her
kimball smiles and nods at jean as she leaves
well whats the topic of discussion
the disappearance of paul owen
well i havent heard anything about the disappearance or anything
trying to laugh not on page six at least
i think his family wants this kept quiet
staring at the untouched bottle of san pellegrino lime
i can always get you a lime
just some preliminary questions that i need for my own files okay
how old are you
ill be twenty seven in october
scribbling in his notebook where did you go to school
the harvard business school
fifty five west eighty first street
the american gardens building
looking up impressed nice
a pause as kimball studies his notebook
bateman closes his eyes as if in pain
pardon me but are you okay
who do you ask
bateman reaches into his desk drawer and brings out a bottle of aspirin
kimball takes out a pack of marlboros and lays it on the desk
a pause as bateman stares at the cigarettes
would you rather i not smoke
no i guess its okay
buzzing jean yes patrick
bring us an ashtray for mr
she whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence
what can you tell me about paul owen
he coughs shakes two nuprin into his hand and swallows them dry
how well did you know him
at a loss
he was part of that whole
yale thing you know
what do you mean
well i think for one that he was probably a closet homosexual
who did a lot of cocaine
that yale thing
a silence during which the sound of the air conditioner becomes deafening
theres nothing you can tell me about paul owen
he led what i suppose was an orderly life
ate a balanced diet
what kind of man was he
he hesitates tries to smile the information youve just given
i hope im not being cross examined here
do you feel that way
as he writes without looking up where did paul hang out
let me think
the new york yacht club
the regular places
he had a yacht
no he just hung out there
and where did he go to school
a slight pause
dont you know this
i just wanted to know if you know
if i remember correctly saint pauls
listen i just
i just want to help
he makes another note
anything else you can tell me about owen
we were both seven in
smiles so was i
do you have any witnesses or fingerprints
well theres a message on his answering machine saying he went to london
well maybe he did huh
his girlfriend doesnt think so
has anyone seen him in london
well ive had a hard time getting an actual verification
a stephen hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there but i checked it out and what happened is he mistook a hubert ainsworth for paul so
was he involved at all do you think in occultism or satan worship
i know it sounds like a lame question but in new jersey i know this sounds like a lame question but last month i dont know if youve heard about
this but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts yikes
paul wasnt into that
he followed a balanced diet and yeah i know and was into that whole yale thing
a pause the longest so far
have you consulted a psychic
had his apartment been burglarized
no it actually hadnt
toiletries were missing
a suit was gone
so was some luggage
i mean no ones dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything right
no not yet
as i said were not sure
basically no one has seen or heard anything
thats so typical isnt it
its just strange
he stares out the window lost in thought one day someones walking around going to work alive and then
the earth just opens up and swallows people
he checks his rolex eerie
standing up youll have to excuse me
i have a lunch meeting with cliff huxtable at four seasons in twenty minutes
isnt the four seasons a little far uptown
i mean arent you going to be late
i didnt know that
bateman leads him to the door
its very good
kimball turns to face him
listen if anything occurs to you any information at all
absolutely im with you
great and thanks for your uh time mr
bateman closes the door firmly on kimball
he closes his eyes and leans against the door sweating
a perfectly lit kitchen still life a bottle of evian a white porcelain plate on which sits a sliced kiwi some perfect green grapes a few berries
offscreen the sound of screams and a chainsaw can be heard from the living room
the living room bateman is maniacally doing abdominal crunches as the television plays a video of texas chainsaw massacre
there is a pile of horror videos on his coffee table next to a copy of gq
bateman is sitting in his armchair phone book in hand jerking off
he is squealing into the phone and breathing
you like that slut
the person on the other end clearly hangs up
close up on his fingers dialing the phone
you want to know what im wearing
sixty dollar boxer shorts by ralph lauren a hundred and fifty dollar white cotton t shirt by commes des garcons
he snorts like a pig my rolex cost another hang up
he dials again
whipering im a corporate raider
i orchestrate hostile takeovers
what do you think of that
makes disgusting sucking noises and grunts huh bitch
dad is that you
bateman hangs up frustrated
bateman cruises around in the limo
it pulls up alongside christie a pretty blonde hooker in shorts and leather jacket
bateman opens his window to speak to her
i havent seen you around here
you just havent been looking
would you like to see my apartment
bateman flips on the light inside the limo
hes wearing a tuxedo
looking away to some dark corner im not supposed to
bateman is holding out a bill which christie now notices then takes
do you want to come to my apartment or not
im not supposed to
she pockets the bill but i can make an exception
do you take american express
christie is still looking out behind her
do you take american express
christie looks at him like hes crazy
come on get in
as they drive uptown bateman dials the cell phone
he reads off a credit card number
id like a girl early twenties blonde who does couples
fifty five west eighty first the american gardens building
and i really cant stress blonde enough
he hangs up
bateman im paul
my name is paul wen have yougot that
you are christie
you are to respond only to christie
is that clear
christie is in the bathtub bateman is pouring in white milky bath oil
thats a very fine chardonnay youre drinking
long pause in which christie is luxuriating in the tub and bateman is casually touching her breast
i want you to clean your vagina
christie reaches for a washcloth
get on your knees
i want to watch
you have a very nice body
the doorman rings
send her up
christie get out and dry off choose a robe not the bijan and come and meet me and our guest in the living room for drinks
bateman answers the door
how lovely let me take your coat
how good of you to come
the escort girl looks somewhat bewildered
bateman takes her coat and inspects her body and face
not quite blonde are you
more dirty blonde
im going to call you sabrina
im paul owen
bateman escorts her into the living room and brings her a glass of wine
christie enters sitting next to sabrina on the couch and bateman sits across from them
there is a long silence
so dont you want to know what i do
the two girls look at each other with uncomfortable smiles
smiling no not really
bateman is visibly irritated recrosses his legs
well i work on wall street
at pierce pierce
long pause have you heard of it
another long pause
they shake their heads
christie stands up and goes over to the cd collection
you have a really nice place here
how much did you pay for it
actually thats none of your business christie hut i can assure you it certainly wasnt cheap
bateman leaves to refill his wine glass and sabrina takes a pack of cigarettes out of her purse
bateman returns carrying a tray of chocolates
no no smoking
not in here
he walks over to christie
christie stares at the plate and shakes her head
sabrina takes one
i dont want you to get drunk but thats a very fine chardonnay youre not drinking
bateman goes over to his cds and scans his vast collection
he takes one out and examines it
do you like phil collins
ive been a big genesis fan ever since the release of their album duke
before that i really didnt understand any of their work
it was too artsy too intellectual
it was on duke where phil collins presence became more apparent
he puts aside the cd and takes out another one
i think invisible touch is the groups undisputed masterpiece
he puts on the song and gestures for them to follow him into the bedroom
its an epic meditation on intangibility at the same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums
christie take off the robe
bateman puts out a lace teddy
he motions to christie to put it on
listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of banks collins and rutherford
you can practically hear every nuance of every instrument
sabrina remove your dress
bateman starts to undress
in terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer songwriting this album hits a new peak of professionalism
sabrina why dont you dance a little
sabrina dances awkwardly
christie sits on the bed
take the lyrics to land of confusion
in this song phil collins addresses the problem of abusive political authority
bateman knots a silk scarf around christies neck rather menacingly then helps her into some suede gloves
in too deep is the most moving pop song of the s about monogamy and commitment
the song is extremely uplifting
their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything ive heard in rock
he turns on the video camera
christie get down on your knees so sabrina can see your asshole
bateman looks through the viewfinder
phill collins solo efforts seem to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying in a narrower way especially songs like in the air tonight and against all odds
sabrina dont just stare at it
he walks over to the sound system in his bedroom and slides in the cd
but i also think that phill collins works better within the confines of the group than as a solo artist and i stress the word artist
this is sussudio a great great song a personal favorite
sex montage cut to sussudio
we see this in wide shot or through the lens of the video camera
bateman asleep in his bed with christie and sabrina on either side of him
sabrina accidentally touches his wrist
batemans eyes open
dont touch the rolex
bateman gets up from his bed and goes over to his armoire
he opens the drawer in which are a nail gun a coat hanger a rusty butter knife and a half smoked cigar
he turns around to see christie and sabrina both starting to get up and get dressed
he takes the coat hanger
were not through yet
bateman ushering them out the door impatiently
they are both sobbing badly bruised and bleeding
bateman has a deep scratch on his hand and one on his shoulder
in the b
phil collins in the air tonight is playing
mcdermott van patten and bateman are having drinks
price walks by with a gorgeous girl and gives them the finger
what an asshole
mcdermott why is laurie kennedy dating price
hes a fucking drug addict
no self control
but laurie kennedy is a total hardbody
what do you think bateman
i know her
i knew her
mcdermott why do you say it like that
why does he say it like that
because he dated her
how did you guess
girls dig bateman
youre total cq bateman
thanks guy but
shes got a lousy personality
mcdermott so what
its all looks
laurie kennedy is a babe
dont even pretend you were interested for any other reason
if they have a good personality then something is very wrong
mcdermott if they have a good personality and they are not great looking who fucking cares
well lets just say hypothetically okay
what if they have a good personality
he smiles giving up i know i know there are no girls with good personalities
they laugh and high five each other a good personality consists of a chick with a little hardbody who will satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things
and who will essentially keep her dumb fucking mouth shut
mcdermott listen the only girls with good personalities who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or even talented though god knows what the fuck that means are ugly
mcdermott and this is because they have to make up for how fucking unattractive they are
do you know what ed gein said about women
maitre d at canal bar
no serial killer wisconsin in the fifties
he was an interesting guy
mcdermott so what did ed say
he said when i see a pretty girl walking down the street i think two things
one part of me wants to take her out and talk to her and be real nice and sweet and treat her right
pauses finishes his drink
mcdermott what does the other part of him think
what her head would look like on a stick
mcdermott and van patten look at each other and then back at bateman
bateman starts to laugh and the other two uneasily join in
luis carruthers walks up to the table
shyly hi guys
i wanna get your opinion on something
mcdermott rolls his eyes at the rest of the table
mcdermott if its about the bow tie youre wearing you know how we feel about it
luis laughs good naturedly
yes i do
no its my business card i decided to get a new one too
he pulls out something incredibly tasteful
everyone compliments luis except bateman
the sound drops and all we hear is the beating of his heart as he stares at the card enviously
luis plucks it from his hand and walks away pleased with himself
listen what about dinner
suddenly angry is that all you ever have to contribute van patten
what about fucking dinner
mcdermott ah cheer up bateman
slaps him on the back massages his neck whats the matter
no shiatsu this morning
watching luis going into the mens room keep touching me like that and youll draw back a stump
mcdermott whoa hold on there little buddy
he gets up from the table
as bateman walks away van patten grabs a waiter
is this tap water
i dont drink tap water bring me an evian or something okay
bateman pulls on his gloves as he enters the mens room
carruthers is standing in a stall with his back to bateman
the sound of his urinating is heard until bateman approaches then abruptly stops
slowly bateman brings his hands up over the collar of carruthers cashmere jacket circling his neck until both thumbs and index fingers meet
all we can hear is the sound of batemans heavy breathing
slowly he starts to squeeze
almost in slow motion carruthers turns around
carruthers looks down at batemans wrists as if lost in thought
then he lowers his head and kisses batemans wrist
he looks back at bateman with a shy love struck expression then reaches up and tenderly touches the side of his face
he strokes batemans hair
ive seen you looking at me
ive noticed your hot body
carruthers tries to kiss him on the lips but bateman backs away
he drops his hands from carruthers neck
carruthers immediately takes them and places them back
bateman drops them again
dont be shy
bateman takes a deep breath closes his eyes and tries to lift his hands again but abandons the attempt
you dont know how long ive wanted it
ever since that christmas party at arizona
you know the one you were wearing that red striped paisley armani tie
bateman looks down and sees that carruthers pants are still unzipped
he moves past him out of the stall and stands by the sink and pretends to wash his hands until he realizes he still has his gloves on
carruthers comes up behind him
i want you
i want you
bateman storms out of the mens room bumping into a waiter and several customers and cursing
noticing the maitre d and another waiter conferring and looking at him strangely bateman straightens up and smiles and waves cheerfully at them
carruthers walks up behind him
where are you going
stumbling away from him ive gotta
return some videotapes
silently mouthing the words ill call you
bateman storms out of the restaurant
bateman is lying on top of courtney in her bed after sex
still panting he rolls off her onto his back
he feels something lumpy underneath him and pulls out a stuffed toy a black cat with blue jewel eyes
there is silence
will you call me before thanksgiving
courtney sighs and reaches for a bottle of pills on her nightstand swallowing several
bateman gets up and begins to dress admiring himself in the mirror
courtney watches the tv at low volume
what are you doing tonight
dinner at the river cafe
au bar afterwards maybe
lighting a cigarette we were supposed to have dinner at tad and mauras but you know how luis is
i never knew you smoked
smiling sadly you never noticed
bateman is making final adjustments to his tie
can we talk
you look marvelous
theres nothing to say
youre going to marry luis
next week no less
sarcastically isnt that special
a pause patrick
if i dont see you before thanksgiving have a nice one okay
flatly you too
courtney picks up the black cat and starts petting its head
bateman heads down the hallway to the front door
a big eighties nightclub with a mixed crowd hip hop kids visitors from jersey downtown art people yuppies
i bateman makes his way through the crowd to the bar and tries to attract the bartenders attention
he is wearing a suit and his tie is loosened
kimball approaches him
bateman gasps and recovers
extending his hand call me don
you hang out here a lot
hows the investigation going
taken anyone in for formal questioning
he makes quotation marks in the air and laughs a not so relaxed laugh h no
informal conversations mostly
whats that stoli
no finlandia as usual
looking at his glass too true
you know bateman people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when theyre in a relaxed setting dont you think
bateman is nodding nervously idiotically
some people just can t help themselves
bateman shakes his head
i mean they want to get caught
dan great to see you again
like i said you need anything at all im your man
i dont envy your job
i mean owen was a
bateman wanders away
he looks back uneasily at kimball who is watching him from the bar
a guy with dreadlocks walks by
holding up his hand to high five rasta man
the man stares at him
i mean mon
we be jammin
the man walks by shaking his head
bateman wanders into the next room which is filled with a more familiar crowd young men in designer suits girls in black designer dresses
across the room he spots mcdermott and price sitting with three models all wearing black mini dresses
price and mcdermott are having a whispered argument
i have to talk to these girls
mcdermott someone has to get the bolivian marching powder
you went last time
mcdermott waves gaily to the girls and disappears
bateman looks at the models
daisy and caron are staring into space smoking
libby is trying to work out how to unfold her napkin
price signals to bateman for help
clapping his hands together lets have a conversation
it was hot out today no
where did craig go
well gorbachev is downstairs
mcdermott is going to sign a peace treaty with him between the united states and russia
mcdermotts the one behind glasnost you know

i m into well murders and executions mostly
daisy unfazed do you like it
it depends why
well most guys i know who work in mergers and acquisitions dont really like it
so where do you work out
the club is half empty now
price is leaning over a balcony messed up on drugs
bateman comes up behind him in a menacing way that suggests he might push him over the railing
price turns around wild eyed just as bateman is reaching for him
shouting im leaving
im getting out
bateman is confused he thinks price is referring to his drink
dont ill drink it
screaming listen to me patrick
are you going to go get a gram
dont tell me
no you dumb son of a bitch
laughing where to
price looks away
mcdermott and daisy walk up to them
mcdermott hey dont worry be happy
price lifts his arms up as if greeting the crowd and is shouting something that cant be heard then goodbye
he climbs over the railing
daisy what is he doing
price leaps from the balcony
he disappears for a moment then resurfaces and runs off into the crowd
bateman and daisy are waiting for a cab
my ex boyfriend fiddler who was in there he plays in this band that just opened for u he couldnt understand what i was doing with a yuppie
she laughs he said you gave him bad vibes
thats too bad
you think im dumb dont you
you think im dumb
you think all models are dumb
i really dont
i dont mind
theres something sweet about you
she takes his hand as they get into a cab
bateman leaves daisys apartment carrying a suitcase
he pauses in the hallway and tucks some long blonde hair back inside the case
bateman sits at his desk wearing wayfarers doing the new york times crossword puzzle at dusk
jean knocks gently on the half open door and walks in with a folder in her hand
bateman ignores her
doin the crossword
bateman nods without looking up
bateman doesnt respond
we see that every space on the puzzle has been filled in with the words meat or bone
jean drops the folder on his desk and then walks out
re enters office yes patrick
would you like to accompany me to dinner
he erases one of the ms on the crossword puzzle
if youre not doing anything
i have no plans
lowering his wayfarers well isnt this a coincidence
listen where should we go
he leans back and pulls a zagats from the desk drawer
anywhere you want
lets not think about what i want
how about anywhere you want
oh patrick i cant make this decision
no come on
anywhere you want
oh i cant
sighs i dont know
where do you want to go
anywhere you want
just say it
i can get us in anywhere
a long pause
bateman stops looking through the zagats guide and smiles at her
dorsia is where jean wants to go
oh i dont know
no well go anywhere you want
he dials the number
yes can you take two tonight oh lets say at nine oclock
he checks his rolex and winks at jean
we are totally booked
i said we are totally booked
two at nine
there are no tables available tonight
the waiting list is also totally booked
see you then
he hangs up the phone
he walks over to the coat rack
he glances over at jean who is still standing in front of the desk confused
you didnt give them a name
they know me
why dont you meet me at my house at seven oclock for drinks okay
she turns to leave
youll want to change before we go out
jean stands by the floor to ceiling windows looking out
patrick its so
what a wonderful view
bateman opens up the freezer where daisys head is cleady visible
id love some
bateman walks in with a bottle of wine and a corkscrew in his hand and hands her the sorbet

silence as bateman walks around his apartment opens up his knife drawer looking at the knives

she puts the spoon in the carton jean

he points the nail gun at the back of jeans head
the phone rings
startled bateman hides the nail gun behind his back
the answering machine picks up
as bateman listens he discreetly places the nail gun behind the couch
he sits down opposite jean enjoying her discomfort as she listens to the message

i dont want to get bruised

she gets up to leave
and dont forget you have a breakfast meeting with frederick bennet and charles rust at
it slipped my mind completely
he sinks back on the sofa and shuts his eyes
bateman enters p p walks up the corridor and pauses outside the door to his office
he sees kimball in conversation with jean and jean looking through her date book
he watches for a moment frozen with anxiety
he then bursts in shutting the door behind him
kimball ive been wanting to talk with you come into my office
jean great jacket
jean looks flustered
kimball follows bateman into his office
i actually came to see timothy price but hes taken a leave of absence
yeah gone into rehab
hopefully is he a suspect
do you remember where you were on the night of pauls disappearance
he checks his notebook which was on the twentieth of december
i was probably returning videotapes
he opens his desk drawer and pretends to search through his diary
i had a date with a girl named veronica
thats not what ive got
thats not the information ive received
what information have you received
he flips through his notebook that you were with well i could he wrong
when was the last time you were with paul owen
clearly nervous and under pressure we had
gone to a new musical called
oh africa brave africa
a laugh riot
and thats about it
i think we had dinner at orsos
last time i physically saw him was
at an automated teller
i cant remember which
just one that was near um nells
kimball is clearly giving up on bateman for now
he opens his briefcase to put away his notebook
well thank you mr
i hope ive been informative
long day a bit scattered
listen im a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when ive sorted out all this information
great yes id like that
and if you could try and pin down where you were the night of owens disappearance it would make my job a lot easier
im with you on that one
kimball is rifling through his briefcase
he pulls out a new shrink wrapped cd and holds it up
huey lewis and the news
i just bought it on my way here
bateman stares at the cd stunned terrified
i dont really like
not a big music fan eh
no i like music
just theyre hueys too
well to each his own
so lunch thursday
ill call your secretary about reservations
ill be there
the same street corner where bateman found christie before
the limo is kept idling as he talks to her through a half opened window
im not so sure about this
i had to go to emergency after last time
oh this wont be anything like last time i promise
i dont think so
he hands her a bill
just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute
the drivers here youll be safe
christie gets in hesitantly
nothing like last time promise
he pours her a shot of vodka and makes her drink it
chatting as if they were at a cocktail party so youre looking great how have you been
a little confused well i actually might need a little surgery after last time
mock shock really
my friend told me i should maybe even get a lawyer
oh lawyers are so complicated dont do that
he writes her a check for i to cash and hands it to her
she snatches the check out of his hand and gets quickly out of the limo walking hurriedly down the street
he follows alongside her slowly in the limo waving a huge wad of cash at her
she hesitates he uses the money to lure her into the car
as she reluctantly gets into the limo she reaches for the money
he snatches it away
uh uh uh
half now half later
she takes the money and puts it inside her shirt
okay your name is christie
were meeting a friend of mine elizabeth
shell be joining us in my new apartment shortly
youll like her
shes a very nice girl
dont say anything about yourself
is that clear
the living room elizabeth has kicked off her shoes and flopped down on the couch underneath the baselitz
elizabeth is an attractive dark haired society girl who models occasionally
christie is sitting on the couch opposite her pretending to examine a cd
you look really familiar
did you you go to dalton
christie shakes her head
the kitchen bateman is grinding up tabs of ecstasy and putting them in a bottle of wine
in the living room elizabeth is still staring at christie as if she came from mars
i think i met you at au bar didnt i
christie looks blank
well maybe not with spicey but it was definitely at au bar
christie still blank
you know au bar
christie shakes her head
anyway au bar sucks now its terrible
i went to a birth day party there for malcolm forbes
oh my god please
bateman enters carrying the bottle of wine and two glasses
christie who seems frightened sips her wine and stares at the floor
there is an awkward silence
this is nicer than your other apartment
offended that she prefers owens apartment its not that nice
where did you two meet
i met him at oh god the kentucky derby in no and
turning to patrick you were hanging out with that bimbo allison poole
sarcastically hot number
what do you mean she was a hot number
if you had an american express card shed give you a blowjob
to christie listen this girl worked in a tanning salon need i say more
what do you do
a long silence
christie reddens and stares at the floor
skeptically uh huh
elizabeth looks at bateman dubiously
wheres your phone
ive got to call harley
bateman hands her a cordless phone
she dials and stares at christie while she waits for someone to answer
where do you summer
christie looks at bateman and then back at elizabeth
listening to the receiver oh god its his machine
elizabeth its three in the morning
hes a goddamn drug dealer
these are his peak hours
dont tell him youre here
why would i
bateman has poured her another glass of wine
she downs the whole glass making a face
this tastes weird
she examines the label and shrugs harley
i need your services
translate that anyway youd like
im at whispering youre at paul owen s
whispering paul owen
i want the number idiot
she waves him away and continues into the reciever anyway im at paul normans and ill try you later and if i dont see you at canal bar tomorrow night
im going to sic my hairdresser on you
she hangs up
did you know that guy who disappeared
didnt he work at pierce pierce too
was he a friend of yours
do you have any coke
id take a halcyon
bateman sits next to elizabeth on the couch and pours her another glass of the drugged wine
listen i would just like to see
the two of you
get it on
whats wrong with that
its totally disease free
laughing patrick you re a lunatic
dont you find christie attractive
lets not get lewd
flirty im in no mood to have a lewd conversation
i think it would be a turn on
to christie does he do this all the time
christie youre not drinking your wine
christie looks at her wine and gingerly takes a sip
to elizabeth are you telling me youve never gotten it on with a girl
im not a lesbian
why do you think id be into that
well you went to sarah lawrence for one thing
those are sarah lawrence guys patrick
youre making me feel weird
elizabeth is now writhing around on the couch and making out with christie
bateman holds up a whitney houston cd showing them the picture of whitney on the cover
did you know that whitney houstons debut lp called simply whitney houston had four number one singles on it
did you know that christie
whitneys voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile though shes mainly a jazz singer that its hard to take in the album on a first listening
you actually listen to whitney houston
you actually have a whitney houston cd
more than one
she giggles rolling off the sofa onto the floor
ignoring her its hard to choose a favorite track among so many great ones but the greatest love of all is one of the best most powerful songs ever written
about self preservation and dignity
its universal message crosses all boundaries and instills one with the hope that its not too late to better ourselves
to act kinder
since elizabeth its impossible in the world we live in to empathize with others we can always empathize with ourselves
as he speaks he opens the case and carefully places the cd in the player admiring its pristine silver surface and watches it slide into the machine
its an important message crucial really and its beautifully stated on the album
an out of focus home video shot of elizabeth christie and bateman in the throes of sex in the master bedroom
cut back to wide shot of the bedroom partially blocked by the video camera in the foreground
their bodies are an incoherent tangle of arms and legs
the only sounds are moans heavy breathing and the slapping of flesh against flesh
close on christies head and shoulders
her eyes are shut as she grimly concentrates on giving a good professional performance turning her head every so often to check the progress of her partners
offscreen we hear elizabeth panting in genuine pleasure moaning loudly
her voice gets louder and louder and then shifts to actual pain
bateman rises up off the bed suddenly appearing behind christie
there is blood on his face
christie turns her head and sees him
she screams and leaps off the bed running out of the room
she slams the mirrored door behind her and as it swings shut for a split second we see elizabeth writhing in pain on the bed
we follow christie out of the room panicking screaming
christie runs down a darkened hallway frantically opening doors looking for an escape
she hears the sound of a chainsaw coming from the bedroom
she opens a closet
the closet lights up as she opens the door and sees two dead women hanging inside
she screams then claps a hand over her mouth
she stops and listens
the she backs away slowly into another dark room lit only by the light from a television set
through the darkness she sees a head on the top of the tv and starts to whimper
she runs toward the nearest door
finding herself in the main hallway she begins to jog toward the front door then runs
bateman appears from nowhere holding the chainsaw spattered with blood
christie screams and changes direction
bateman leaps at her bellowing
they run through the bedroom and into the bathroom
christie trips over elizabeths body which is half in the bathtub
both are slipping on the floor which is slick with blood
christie falls tries to get up
bateman grabs her leg
he tries to bite it
she kicks him in the face and gets up running toward the front door
he runs after her
not the face you bitch
not the fucking face you piece of bitch trash
christie screaming makes it out the front door
bateman runs after her
she runs down the hall screaming and banging on doors
she moves to the elevator pounding hysterically on the buttons
she sees the stairwell and runs for it
bateman sees this and runs after her revving the chainsaw
she runs down the stairs bateman two flights behind her
he stops leans over the railing to look at her then aims the chainsaw at her and drops it
christie screams offscreen then is suddenly silent
from batemans pov we see christies body sprawled facedown at the bottom of the stairwell
the chainsaw sticks out of her back like a sword
an insanely expensive restaurant with a childhood motif paper tablecloths and jars of crayons for drawing lots of primary colors and a goldfish bowl on each table
bateman is at a table with evelyn
they are both drawing on the tablecloth
bateman is drawing christie with the chainsaw in her back
i want a firm commitment
i think evelyn that weve
evelyn waves to a couple across the room
speaking very carefully measuring each word my need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be um corrected but i have no other way to fulfill my
the woman across the room holds up her hand displaying a new bracelet
evelyn smiles and nods approvingly
we need to talk
talk about what patrick
what is there to talk about
its over evelyn
its all over motioning to the waiter for water touchy touchy
im sorry i brought the wedding up
lets just avoid the issue alright
now are we having coffee
im fucking serious
its fucking over
this is no joke
i dont think we should see each other anymore
but your friends are my friends
my friends are your friends
i dont think it would work
reaching over to dab his face with a napkin you have a little something on your upper lip
brushing her hand away i know that your friends are my friends
ive thought about that
you can have them
evelyn stares at him suspicious and bewildered a realization dawning
youre really serious arent you
yes i am
but what about the past
we never really shared one
in touch with humanity
evelyn im sorry
he pauses as if searching for the right words youre just not terribly important to me
evelyn begins to cry
no no no
i know my behavior is
she reaches desperately across the table and takes his hand
bateman pulls his hand away
sobbing what do you want me to do what is it you want
the occupants of nearby tables begin to stare
bateman is becoming increasingly agitated and embarrassed
looking uncomfortably around the room if you really want to do something for me you can stop making this scene right now
oh god i cant believe this
im leaving now
ive assessed the situation and im going
evelyn makes an effort to compose herself
she blots the tears so they will not affect her make up
surprisingly calm where are you going
im just leaving
i have to return some videotapes
he rushes out of the room
bateman wanders into misty tribeca streets sees a stray cat
here kitty kitty
the small mangy cat rubs against him
he picks it up and walks toward an atm holding the cat
he puts his card in the machine
the screen reads feed me a stray cat
bateman begins to attempt to shove the kitten into the deposit slot with some difficulty
the kitten squeals
he takes a gun from out of his pocket and points it at the kitten
he doesnt notice the woman waiting behind him
oh my god
what are you doing
bateman wheels around and shoots her
she falls screaming to the floor
responding to the gunshot a police car siren wails in the distance
bateman breaks into a run
the police car screeches after him
bateman ducks down an alley
a cop rushes toward him seemingly from out of nowhere and tackles him trying to get the gun away from him
bateman manages to shoot the cop in the face while both of them have their hands on the gun then shoots him again
he reloads the gun
the sound of more cop cars arriving
he runs out of the alley
as he reaches the street he finds a phalanx of police cars approaching
put down your weapon
the cops leap out and fire a warning shot in the air
bateman shoots at them
the police return fire
bateman ducks down behind a parked car and continues shooting wildly
a bullet hits the gas tank of one of the police cars
it catches fire and explodes
the flames light up the scene illuminating the bodies of policemen both living and dead
new angle bateman flees from the scene
the camera follows him as he runs along a row of porsches trying to open each one setting off a cacophony of car alarms
the sound of police sirens draws near
new angle he runs panting until he ends up in front of a tail brilliantly lit office building
as he approaches the lights in the building are going off floor by floor
he rushes into the lobby running for the elevator
burning the midnight oil mr
you forgot to sign in
bateman wheels around and shoots him
he runs toward the revolving doors
as he swings around in the doors he notices a janitor who has witnessed the shooting
he revolves back into the lobby and shoots the janitor
he runs out of the building and across the street to an identical office building the one that houses pierce pierce
bateman nods at the pierce pierce night watchman and signs in
he breathes a sigh of relief as the elevator doors close behind him
bateman stands looking out through the floor length windows at a panoramic night view of the city and the river
below him he sees a swat team swarming over the roof of the opposite building
there are ambulances standing by flares everywhere distant sirens
suddenly the sound of a helicopter draws near
frightened he drops to the floor behind his desk
helicopter searchlights scan the building illuminating batemans office for a few moments with a blaze of light
he is crouched in one corner half sobbing talking into the phone as the searchlight keeps circling
harold its bateman
youre my lawyer so i think you should know ive killed a lot of people
some escort girls in an apartment uptown some homeless people maybe five or ten an nyu girl i met in central park
i left her in a parking lot near dunkin donuts
i killed bethany my old girlfriend with a nail gun
and a man some old faggot with a dog
last week i killed another girl with a chainsaw i had to she almost got away there was someone else there maybe a model i cant remember but shes dead
and paul owen
i killed paul owen with an ax in the face
his body is dissolving in a bathtub in hells kitchen
i dont want to leave anything out here
i guess ive killed people maybe i have tapes of a lot of it
some of the girls have seen the tapes i even
well i ate some of their brains and i tried to cook a little
tonight i just well i had to kill a lot of people and im not sure i m going to get away with it this time i mean i guess
im a pretty sick guy
so if you get hack tomorrow i may show up at harrys bar so you know keep your eyes open
bateman hangs up the phone
the helicopter searchlight circles back briefly illuminating the room
the camera rises up over bateman huddled in the corner staring blankly at the sky
kimball and bateman are sitting at a corner table
very surprised no hash browns
not in the mood i guess
everyone orders the hash browns here
i mean its have you been here before
deliberately nonchalant yes of course
the hash browns are delicious
looking at him like hes nuts suit yourself i guess
so the night he disappeared
any new thoughts on what you did
im not really sure
i had a shower
and some sorbet
i think maybe youve got your dates mixed up
where do you place paul that night
according to his date book and this was verified by his secretary he had dinner with
ive questioned him
and he denies it
though at first he couldnt be sure
but marcus denied it
well does marcus have an alibi
smiling i checked it out
kimball now where were you
he laughs laughing with him where was marcus
he wasnt with paul owen
so who was he with
he was at atlantis with craig mcdermott frederick dibble harry newman george butner and he pauses then looks up you
a moment of stunned silence
we had wanted paul owen to come
but he said he had plans
i guess i had dinner with victoria
the following night
personally i think the guy went a little nutso
split town for a while
maybe he did go to london
anyway im pretty sure hell turn up sooner or later
a pause i mean to think that one of his friends killed him for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous
isnt that right patrick
mcdermott stops by the table
hows the investigation
talking to bateman
dont believe a word he says
laughs uproariously slapping him on the back bateman whats wrong with you
bateman looks at him in silence panicking
mcdermott you cant eat at smith and wollensky without ordering the hash browns
jesus bateman youre a raving maniac
been at pierce pierce too long
he wanders off muttering no fucking hash browns
bateman walks into the lobby of paul owens building
he has a surgical mask in one hand
what can i do for you sir
wolfe is up there right now
the real estate agent
you do have an appointment dont you
bateman steps out of the elevator and walks cautiously down the hallway
owens door is open
the apartment is freshly painted and has been immaculately redecorated in english country house style overstuffed sofas lots of chintz
there are flowers everywhere and a young yuppie couple stands admiring the place talkingto the realtor mrs
bateman wanders down the hallway looking for familiar signs
he stops at the closet where we last saw two dead girls hanging
he opens the door and the light switches on but it is empty
wolfe approaches smiling
are you my two oclock
wolfe eyes him strangely then looks down at the surgical mash clutched in his hand
her expression changes
can i help you
im looking for
she stares at him impassively
doesnt he live here
no he doesnt
are you sure
you saw the ad in the times
i mean yes i did
in the times
doesnt paul owen still live here
there was no ad in the times
bateman is shaking as they continue to stare at each other
i think you should go now
but i think
i want to know what happened here
dont make any trouble
i suggest you go
bateman backs away slowly
dont come back
wolfe glares at him as he walks down the hall rattled and gets into the elevator
bateman enters the revolving door of an office building panicking and breathing heavily
he is sweating his hair is wild and he looks deranged
he goes around the revolving door twice and comes out onto the street again where he bumps smack into a guy just like him
bateman looks up at him wild eyed
see you at fluties okay
the guy walks away utterly unfazed
bateman wanders down the street banging his briefcase against walls garbage cans etc
bateman searches his pockets for pills
he finds three different pills and swallows them
hes sweating and takes his jacket off to wipe his face dialing a number
patrick batemans office
is that you
jean i need help
where are you
jean im not craig mcdermott called
he wants to meet you and david van patten and tim price at harrys for drinks

where are you
patrick whats wrong
i dont think im gonna make it jean
to the office this afternoon
what is it patrick
are you alright
stop sounding so fucking sad
he hangs up
he throws the walkman which is around his neck into a nearby trash can and wipes his face with his jacket
jean sits at batemans desk
she looks around and then opens his desk drawer and tentatively begins to search through it
bateman comes into the bar a little cleaned up from the previous scene hes smoothed his hair but still panicking and disheveled
he spots his friends in a corner sits down still breathing heavily
price is on his cell phone trying to get reservations
mcdermott bateman youre looking a little wild eyed rough day at the office
they all laugh
mcdermott hey look price is back
and hes drinking perrier
he s a changed man
he still cant get a reservation to save his life
bateman sits down silently
mcdermott why dont you try i wooster
just fucking call them
on automatic im not going anywhere unless we have a reservation
van patten le cirque flamingo east oyster bar come on faggots just get a res
keep your shirt on
maybe lose the suspenders
bateman spots harold carnes at the bar tenses
he downs his drink excuse me gentlemen
he approaches carnes cautiously
face it the japanese will own most of this country by the end of the s
bateman approaches trying to act casual
shut up carnes they will not
carnes is surprised turns around looks vaguely confused
so harold did you get my message
carnes lights a cigarette stalling
that was hilarious
that was you wasnt it
waving smoke out of his face yes naturally
bateman killing owen and the escort girls
oh that s fabulous
pause it was a pretty long message wasnt it
what exactly do you mean
the message you left
carnes is distracted waving at people
by the way davis how is cynthia
youre still seeing her right
but wait harold what do you mean
carnes isnt really listening
good to see you
is that edward towers
he turns to go
im not one to bad mouth anyone your joke was amusing
but come on man you had one fatal flaw batemans such a dork such a boring spineless lightweight that i couldnt fully appreciate it
i wasnt fooled for a second
now if youd said price or mcdermott
otherwise it was amusing
now lets have lunch or dinner or something
what are you talking about
bateman is what
he can barely pick up an escort girl let alone
what was it you said he did to her
carnes looks around the club raises his glass to a passing couple
he laughs politely
now if youll excuse me i really must
desperate shouting wait
you dont seem to understand
youre not really comprehending any of this
i killed him
i did it carnes
im patrick bateman
i chopped owens fucking head off
i tortured dozens of girls
the whole message i left on your machine was true
i really must he going
listen dont you know who i am
im not davis im patrick bateman
i talk to you on the phone all the time
dont you recognize me
youre my lawyer
carnes stares at him in confusion and annoyance
now carnes listen to me
listen very very carefully
i killed paul owen and i liked it
i cant make myself any clearer but thats simply not possible
and i dont find this funny anymore
it never was supposed to he
why isnt it possible
eyeing bateman worriedly its just not
why not you stupid bastard
carnes stares at him
because i had dinner with paul owen twice in london
just ten days ago
now if youll excuse me
bateman returns back to his friends table in a daze
they are all looking at the television where ronald reagan is giving a speech about iran contra
they are halfheartedly arguing about whether or not hes lying
how can he lie like that
how can he pull that shit
now where do we have reservations at
i mean im not really hungry but i would like to have reservations somewhere
to bateman i dont believe it
he looks so
he seems so
out of it
mcdermott he is totally harmless you geek
was totally harmless
just like you are totally harmless
but he did do all that shit and you have failed lo get us into i so you know what can i say
i just dont see how someone anyone can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit
how can you be so fucking i dont know cool about it
some guys are just born cool i guess
bateman laughs at this
price shoots him a look
and bateman what are you so fucking zany about
im just a happy camper
rockin and a rollin
to price rehabs done wonders for you pal
working for unicef now
mcdermott do you want another perrier timothy
some seltzer water
oh brother look he presents himself as a harmless old codger
the sounds of the bar fade away and we hear batemans thoughts but inside doesnt matter
mcdermott bored inside
believe it or not price were actually listening to you
come on what do you think
bateman looks up and smiles at price
the conversation breaks up as van patten takes out his phone
whose moronic idea was it to drink dry beers
i need a scotch
the sounds of the bar fade down
the following voiceover runs over images of bateman and his friends ordering drinks talking on portable phones talking laughing combined with images of other very similar young men at other
tables drinking talking on portable phones talking laughing there are no more barriers to cross
all i have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane the vicious and the evil all the mayhem i have caused and my utter indifference toward it i have
jean is alone in batemans office looking through his diary
we see the pages that she is looking at
they are filled with doodles of mutilated women and their names
jean looks lost and frightened and begins to cry
my pain is constant and sharp and i do not hope for a better world for anyone
i fact i want my pain to be inflicted on others
i want no escape
as the film ends the camera moves close on bateman
he is leaning back in his leather armchair drinking a double scotch his eyes blank
but even after admitting this there is no catharsis
i gain no deeper knowledge about myself no new knowledge can be extracted from my telling
there has been no reason for me to tell you any of this
this confession has meant nothing
