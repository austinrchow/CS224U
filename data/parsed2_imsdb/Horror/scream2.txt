scream screenplay by kevin williamson an old preserved movie theatre
the kind only found in a small town
the marquee in front reads rated r a line has formed around the block guys and girls mostly college age
close on a girl maureen no more than
a friendly face with innocent eyes
she stands in line with her boyfriend phil same age
a handsome counterpart
i hate scary movies
itll be okay baby ill hold your hand
if we hurry we can still catch the sandra bullock movie
we got free tickets
he pulls her close snuggling with her
maureen and phil reach the box office presenting their tickets
they pass through the front doors where an usher stands randomly handing out ghost masks
a hollywood variation of a most familiar one
phil takes one
the studio sent them
the small theatre is nearly packed to capacity
maureen and phil enter moving down the aisle searching for two seats
a young girl screams whizzing by them as a ghost masked guy chases after her
the crowd laughs
everyone is having fun
maureen and phil find aisle seats down towards the screen just as the lights dim
people fake scream in terror
a very lively crowd
credits roll as the movie begins
the studio logo appears followed by
maureen turns to find a ghost mask in her face
phil has slipped it on
i dont think so
phil gets in her face playing with her
she swats him
take it off
maureen looks behind her toward the rest of the audience
a sea of white ghost faces fill the theatre
the publicity masks actually glow in the dark
a chilling sight that leaves maureen extremely spooked
the movie begins
a house in the middle of nowhere
lights burn from within
inside the house a young girl alicia silverstonish is taking a shower
the water cascades over her nubile body
suddenly a figure is glimpsed through the curtain
its all very psycho
now why does she have to be naked
how does that serve the plot
the phone rings
the young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook
she grabs it running from the bathroom into the living room grabbing the phone
a menacing voice responds
who is this
you tell me
maureen is not having a good time
shes already spooked
i hate this shit
the phone rings again
why did you hang up on me
who is this
maureen shifts in her seat
why doesnt she just hang up and call the police
im gonna pee
you want anything
maureen stands and moves up the aisle
maureen emerges from the theatre and into the small lobby
it is dark and shadowed
she moves down a long hallway to a staircase
a bathroom sign with an arrow points downstairs
maureen hits the stairs to
a small lounge leads to two bathroom doors
very low lighting
maureen descends the stairs heading for the
a large bathroom
five stalls line one wall
the door creaks open
maureen enters and shoots for a stall
maureen finishes up fastening her pants
suddenly the bathroom door creaks open
footsteps are heard
loud and heavy
maureen eyes the crack in the stall door
not much is visible
suddenly a shadow sweeps by
the footsteps stop
maureen finishes up quickly
she flushes throws the stall door open and rushes out to find
the stall doors are all closed
maureen shoots for the door
she rips the door open as a figure rushes her
a young girl followed by her friend both perky and loud
they hurl past maureen laughing and carrying on
girl l i got so scared my bladder rolled
you chicken shit
its just a movie
girl l no it really happened
its a true story
maureen is out the door
now thoroughly spooked
alone maureen moves for the stairs when a figure emerges from the shadows
a ghost masked shape appearing behind her
lunging for her grabbing her spinning her around
she screams madly as the ghost starts laughing
the mask comes off
im sorry im sorry but i had to
it was too easy
you are so not funny
phil takes her in his arms
come on baby
lighten up a little will ya
i get scared really easy okay
you gotta go with it
scary movies are great foreplay
he leans down and plants a kiss on her
she caves kissing him back
sweet and sensual
i just have a hard time with insipid sexist violence
nibbling her neck we can still sandra bullock it
nibbling back sandra started without us
we can stay
he kisses her again then breaks away
i gotta whizz
meet me upstairs
want some popcorn
maureen moves up the stairs out of sight
phil turns reaching for the bathroom door just as a
ghost masked figure appears in his path
phil steps back surprised
suddenly a flash of silver shoots forth as phil is pierced with a long sharp knife
quick and silent
he bellies over just as the ghost shape strikes again
phil goes down without a scream
maureen is at the concession
a girl at the counter hands her change and maureen is off with soda and a tub of popcorn
screams and gasps from the audience as the movie plays on
a patio chair comes flying through a glass door
the young girl in the movie tears off running screaming flying through the room
the crowd is really with the movie
some even talk to the screen
you dumb bitch
get out of the house
maureen makes her way back to her aisle seat
she sits down next to
who sits with the mask on
the reflection from the movie bouncing against it in the darkness
give it up
she sits down with the popcorn
how many stabs did i miss
the young girl slips out a side door completely terrified
in her hand she holds a portable phone
maureen offers phil popcorn
why doesnt she run
phil turns to her bringing his finger to his masked lips ssshhing her
the young girl runs by a window
she looks in
a ghost masked killer stares back
the figure crashes through the window attacking her
she fights him off getting away running
everyone in the theater is screaming
maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie
she eats her popcorn
this is so tired
she turns her attention to phil
phil ignores her
she reaches over in the darkness putting her hand on his knee
she inches it up
the ghost masked phil just stares ahead
whatsa the matter
cant i get your ghost
the young girl is running through the yard
the ghost killer is right behind her chasing her
she maureen pretends to watch the movie while her hand continues to move between phils legs
she stares ahead wincing at whats about to happen to the girl on screen
she doesnt notice as phil pulls a long sharp hunting knife from inside his coat jacket
maureens hand moves up phils jacket
something stops her
she feels something on her fingers
she pulls her hand back the reflected movie illuminating bloody fingers
maureen stares at her hand
the ghost advances on the young girl grabbing her pulling her to him raising high a long hunting knife
the young girl is helpless
maureen looks at phil confused
as if seeing for the first time
its not phil
she pulls away when the ghost masked figure grabs her with one hand the other one clutching the hunting knife
maureen sees it her mouth billowing forth a loud scream that is matched by the entire audience as they scream at the screen
the young girl is stabbed in the heart
maureen is helpless
the knife comes fast and furious striking her in the stomach
she falls forward into the aisle as
the young girl clutching her bloody chest
drags herself crawling across wet grass
the killer behind her
raising his knife again
popcorn flies as maureen falls forward into the aisle clutching her bloody stomach
shes speechless unable to scream
she holds her bloody hand out for all to see begging for help
she stumbles down the aisle
someone yells sit down
maureen turns to several people who begin to react
she turns behind her to see the ghost face coming at her again
the young girl is slashed again
the knife slices into maureen again
the theatre audience is starting to take note as the ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife
a horrifying sickening sight
maureen stumbles forward her bloody body moving down to the front of the theater
suddenly the entire audience begins
maureen swaying from side to side turns to the crowd and emits a horrendous blood curdling scream as
the young girl lets out an enormous ear screeching scream that mirrors maureens as the killer attacks one last time stabbing her silencing her forever
the ghost slashes out one last time direct and fierce
maureen falls back against the movie screen
very much dead
her arms flail across the screen
smearing blood over the wide screen image of the ghost mask
a typical college dorm room
industrial strength furniture
theres two of everything
a ringing phone stirs a young girl in bed asleep under a mound of blankets and pillows
the girl starts to rise as the phone is answered
a voice is heard
brass and sassy
who is this
well we identify ourselves around here
no you cant
the girl rolls out of bed her hair falls away to reveal her face its sidney prescott
two years older has brought a maturity to this beautiful young woman
her face posses a survivors edge
stronger and more determined she appears to have weathered the storm
i got it
she stands and moves to
her roommate and friend
an attractive young black woman
twenty at most
full of life
she hands the phone to sidney
knock yourself out
a voice spits out of the phone
deep and haunting
sidney doesnt flinch
whats your favorite scary movie
who is this
you tell me
sidney grabs a small device hooked to the phone
she takes a look at its display
hot flash cory prank phone calls are a criminal offense prosecuted under penal code m
the phone goes dead
enjoy the movie
she hangs the phone up turning to hallie
time to change numbers again
i think itll die off
its opening weekend
lets see how it goes
sidney grabs her robe and shower bucket as hallie channel surfs
various morning news programs are on their small tv
snippets are heard
the two victims maureen evans and phil stevens
the channel switches
a young man is being interviewed
from tv please i just wanna be left alone
his voice stops sidney cold
she turns to the television
he sure gives a lot of interviews for someone who wants to be left alone
hallie hits the remote
the mans image disappears as the tv goes off
hallie turns all smiles
get your ass in gear
dont forget weve got rush at the deltas tonight
dont wear anything you dont want trashed
sidney turns from the television
recovery is immediate
i cant believe i let you talk me into going greek
sid moves to the door and throws it open
a ghost figure leaps at her
she screams but then stops herself
its just a costume hung from her doorframe
preset to scare
sidney rips it down turns to hallie throwing the costume at her
sid is surprisingly cool
she exits out the door leaving hallie staring at the ghost mask in her hands
sid steps outside of her dorm
the morning sun shines down as sid breathes in taking in the day just as sidney did you know the victims
do you feel responsible for the murders
microphones are shoved in her face as sidney is seiged upon by journalists and tv cameras
she starts to panic
do you think there will be more murders
sidney is mortified
she pushes and shoves but there is no escape
the questions come at her like lightning
she sees a whole in the crowd and goes for it as a reporter a flashy woman all hair and teeth thick sunglasses moves in her way
did you kill them last night sid
has it gotten to you
have you finally snapped
sidneys eyes flare
her fist starts to clench when
someone beats her to it
a fist flies out from the crowd connecting with the flashy womans face
sid spins around to find
standing tight fisted
their eyes meet
a quick moment
sidney is happy to see her
the onslaught continues
cameras flash reporters shove
gale moves in front of sid holding the crowd at bay
the reporters begin to throw questions at gale
to sid quick get outta here
whats going on
lll find you later
sid wastes no time
she takes off running around the side of the building
she stops takes a breath but the reporters are on her tail
she looks up to see a
appear moving towards her
it slows down
from the vehicle hop on sid
sid goes for it as two hands reach out to help her
one smooth move and sidney is in the arms of
she looks at him
her face a book of questions
whats going on dewey
he smiles at her
a safe warm smile
his face as cute as ever
itll be alright
the security cart trots along passing students coming and going
dressed smartly in a campus security outfit dewey maneuvers the cart across the campus grounds
sidney rides beside him horrified as she listens to him
three hundred people watched
nobody did anything
they thought it was a publicity stunt
oh my god
how could it happen
they dont know
it was carefully planned
earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie
its a copycat killer i knew this would happen
that fucking movie
the cart comes to a stop in front of a building
as of now they dont see any relation
but theyre checking it out
the state special task force fbi theyre all here
theyll find the guy
look sid why dont you take off
disappear for a few days
ill come with you
i will not crawl under a rock
this is a fucked up world and people kill people all the time
ill just get used to it
dewey steps down off the security cart and helps sid off
nothing will happen to you
sids tough demeanor is cracking
she takes a deep breath
thats why im here right
we take care of each other
cmon ill walk you to class
he starts off for the first time a severe limp is visible as his left leg drags behind him
you go its all stairs i can take it from here
dewey im completely equipped with mace alarm whistle keyring knife a degree in defensive combat
just in case
this is nothing dewey
ill be okay
go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo happy existence
sidney reaches up and gives her pseudo brother a kiss then takes off for the building
dewey watches until she disappears inside then limps back to his security cart
a newsvan pulls up and parks next to a trough of other newsvans and reporters
some are doing live remotes others ready themselves for the next onslaught
gale gets out of the newsvan her cellular affixed to her ear
i dont know
no ones talking
whats the studios position
theyd be stupid to pull the movie
with all this free press theyre gonna have huge numbers this weekend
itll break box office records
of course i have bumps
gales cameraman can be seen behind her in the van fussing with equipment
i need two minutes at six oclock
i wanna do a piece on the slain kids no sympathy shit lets stick with the movie angle
i wanna pull a clip from an old film
gale turns to her cameraman snapping her fingers
hey what was the name of that movie
the guy looks up at her
two years older but still the charming jokester
tom hanks first film
into phone he knows youre alone
yeah find it
dont worry ive got it covered
i have a plan
yeah ill get it
give it a rest i said ill get it
she hangs up turning to randy
you ready for this
im there man
i got ya covered
im so there
thats why im here because im there
randy holds up his camera stoked
sidney moves down a hallway
not your typical school building
through open doorways film equipment is glimpsed
editing bays and the like
shes in the film department
she comes upon an open door and peers in
a large room a class is in progress
she slips in quietly
sidney takes a seat at the back of the room
a handful of film students sit around on torn couches heavy in discussion
sid goes unnoticed as she watches a whirlwind debate
a snotty guy is pontificating a point
sequels are too handicapped
by definition alone theyre inferior films
hallie sits on a couch next to mickey s atheletic cool and rowdy
many sequels have surpassed their original
aliens far better than the original
i much prefer ridley scott
the conversation overlaps everyone arguing
making their point about aliens vs
stay away from her you bitch
ill give you that one
youve got a hard on for cameron
a bigger budget does not make a better movie
terminator one is historical
someone screams out you sarah connor
as the teacher a young artsy type speaks up
how about the godfather part ii
the whole room goes worship silent
all in agreement
the almighty exception
a young man handsome and smooth jumps into the conversation
his name is derek
empire strikes back
from the back of the room sidney watches him
i liked jedi
with the furry things
lucas and his romper room stage
i got it
friday the th case in point
the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels
and why do you think that is
it becomes about money and no ones interested in quality
its more than that
horror films are only as good as their villains
how can freddie and jason possibly be scary after theyve been diluted through five or six sequels
whats the solution
if you were making a sequel today what would you do differently
the class stews on this
derek turns spotting sidney in the back of the room
she gives a half wave
he starts for her excusing himself
the point is i made my point
derek and sidney move out into the hallway
derek throws his arms around her protectively
how are you
you werent in class
i called as soon as i heard
too many thats her looks
im sorry baby
what can i do
dont ask what you can do
life rolls on status quo
he looks at her with bedroom eyes
i can do that
and i can also do this
he moves on her wrapping her in his arms and kissing her passionately
she breaks away laughing
but its a failed objection
he kisses her again and theyre soon devouring each other like two people in love
right in the middle of the hallway
the place is a circus
the front steps of the student center have been roped off to form a platform
a podium and mike have been placed center
crowds have gathered for the press conference that is being held by the university
reporters and cameras have been roped off to the side
on stage dean fisher a sharp looking woman in her forties is talking to spectators
reading from a prepared statement
and we feel this unfortunate isolated tragedy in no way reflects upon our fine school and we should trust that the authorities and fbi are acting quickly to bring us
beside her stand uniformed cops the local sheriff fbi agents
she continues on
gale walks through the crowd listening to the dean
can i have a second
gale spins around to find debbie salt the flashy reporter who she decked earlier standing in front of her
look im sorry about the face
debbie salt stringer newsweek
answer a few questions
what are you doing here
i thought you had retired from field reporting
the woman has immediately put gale on the defensive
two other reporters have taken notice
suddenly cameras are on gale
well you know im dear to the subject matter
and much richer as a result
do i know you
you look familiar
i took your vulture seminar seminar at berkeley last year
good for you
and in seconds the vultures are upon her as gale weathers is beseiged by reporters
the questions spew forth
why are you here
is this the work of a copycat killer
have you talked to sidney
ever smooth guys youre missing the show
and with that gale wanders off into the crowd
the local sheriff a smart looking guy in his s is fielding questions
no we have no evidence of a serial killer
we think the killer acted deliberately and not at random
students and concerned faculty stand
among them are sidney derek hallie and mickey
next to them stand joel s black sensible and friendly
a very intelligent face
but what are they doing
hes talking but hes not saying anything
sounds like they dont know anything
do you think theyll cancel hell week
youre getting nailed youre not getting out of it
from across the way two gorgeous sorority type girls lois and murphy stand with their fraternity jock boyfriends
all looks and attitude
their eyes are on sidney as they huddle in a conspiratory stance
have they questioned you yet sid
this has nothing to do with me joel
theres an estimated serial killers currently active in the us at any given time
i cant control that
i have rehearsal
i have to watch rehearsal
hallie kicks him
joel moves to sid
i gotta hit the library
some of us have real majors
you gonna be okay sid
youre not allowed to ask that
ill stop by the deltas tonight
joel smiles heading out as the two sorority girls lois and murphy saunter over
instantly hallie stands at attention
sidney joins begrudgingly
yes sister lois
very much so
thank you for asking
we need your help pledges
are you familiar with the deltas tp fundraiser
the pledges shake their heads
lois withdraws two rolls of toilet paper from her book bag and passes them out
in our efforts to raise money for our favorite cause
this weeks tke kegger
ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece
weve set you each at a five dollar quota
come on guys
am i getting fraternity interference mickey
i can peddle toilet paper
sid you dont have to
sidney takes her toilet paper
no special treatment
i can do this
she throws him a comforting glance
shes okay with this
she heads off with hallie
how do you put up with this greek shit
hey its cool
hallies into it im into hallie
gale moves through the crowd as the press conference rally continues
she runs dead smack into
their eyes meet
a long moment
the silence between them is revealing
ive been trying to reach you but you havent returned
im on crowd patrol miss weathers excuse me
he tips his hat curtly then starts off
she stops him
the names gale remember
he turns on her
his eyes on fire
yes miss weathers your name is embedded clearly between my ears
i see you read the book
yes i do retain reading skills
and an explanation is of course out of the question
deputy dewey filled the room with his dim witted barney fifish presence
i think youve explained yourself
oh dewey im sorry
no what you are is a money hungry fame seeking liar and forgive me for saying mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be
this stings gale
you have every right to be upset
deputy dewey oozed with inexperience
i never meant to imply
how do you know my dim witted inexperience isnt merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower peoples expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given
gale is at a loss
i dont know what else to say except im sorry
no im the one whos sorry
i misjudged you
now if youll excuse me i have some oozing to do
dewey turns and limps away leaving gale staring after him
her face smashed fiat
the sheriff continues fielding questions from reporters
no there has been no evidence that more than one killer is responsible
sidney and hallie have split up
they move through the crowd selling toilet paper
several students make their purchase
sidney pockets her change looks up to see gale standing alone
she goes to her
how are you
people magazine wont stop calling but other than that
you are the definition of mixed emotions
i really should hate you
i see your movies getting good reviews
it seems to be causing a stir
whats with the toilet paper
its hell week
im pledging the deltas
its good to see you involved
my morn was a delta
people have begun to notice the two of them talking
reporters and spectators have slowly circled them
gale looks around
she spots randy who appears behind sid with his camera
gale gives him the nod
he throws the camera up hits the light
sid spins around surprised to see him
what are you doing here
but then she sees someone else standing off to the side
a man she recognizes immediately
he looks at her his face sullen broken
sidney loses her breath
he moves to her
gale motions to randy
he maneuvers getting the two of them in frame
a long moment sidney just stares at him
completely off guard
she looks to randy who aims the camera directly at her
what are you doing
she turns back to gale staring holes through her realizing shes been set up
she looks back to cotton
she doesnt know what to say
she turns back to gale
sidney storms off disappearing in the crowd
cotton turns to gale
his face pained
this was a mistake
i shouldnt be here
he takes off pushing through the crowd
randy stops filming
can you say backfire
did you get it
yeah i got it
randy is clearly not happy about his part in this
its in his voice
you need to check your conscience at the door
were not here to be loved
randys face reveals otherwise
the sheriff continues
no we dont anticipate another murder but we are taking every precaution possible
a small street that dead ends in a cul de sac
large old homes populate it
greek signs adorn the place
welcome to sorority row
a huge living room
divided sensibly in several sections
et is empty except for one girl who lies on the couch watching television
this is cici pretty with a lively energy about her
she channel surfs while talking on the phone

a wooden porch with a bulb glowing overhead
she stands on the porch steps looking back through the open door into the house
the phone starts to crackle
youre breaking up

cici looks up and down the street
a young guy walks along the sidewalk
calling out to him hey you
the guy wears a headset his head bobbing to the beat
he doesnt see her
cici looks up the street to a sorority house down the block
lights burn from within

the phone begins to crack severely

she tries the phone again

dawnie hangs up the phone turning to cici

she moves back to the foyer where an alarm panel is positioned in the wail
she hits a coupla digits and a beep is heard as she activates the alarm
she checks the door making sure its locked then she turns and moves into the
cici finds the light switch
the room is illuminated
two long dining tables run the length of the room
void of the figure
a large dark kitchen
cici moves to the frig and opens it she gives it the once over
the frig light reflects against her face
she closes the refrigerator not seeing the shadow that bounces across her back
cici moves to a sliding glass door that overlooks the backyard
she checks the lock
then the phone she turns to the phone thats attached to a nearby wall
it rings again
she reaches for it answering it
one finds her neck the other grabs her by the hair wrenching her head backwards and spinning her around shoving her pushing her into the
glass explodes everywhere shattering to bits as cicis body crashes through it setting off the alarm
a loud shrill ring resonants through the house as cicis body lands on the deck outside
note wes does two doors down from chi omega
a big old gothic home serves as the delta zeta sorority
music plays from inside
it sounds like a party
the room is filled with fifteen to twenty people
sorority girls and frat boys who scream and cheer as they watch four girls who sit on their knees hands behind their back in front of a coffee table devouring
plates of macaroni and cheese topped with whipped cream
sidney hallie and two other girls teri and luce tear into the macaroni with all their might
gobbling it up making a mess of themselves
mickey is next to hallie coaching her on
on sid as she finishes her plate
a whistle blows
looks like we have a winner
sid sits up
macaroni and whipped cream is all over her face
she smiles the victor
sidney gets to skip the next round of bulimia bingo
hallie a face full of grime eyes sid
they crack up
someone passes her a towel
she stands wiping her face looking across the room as derek enters through the front door
she waves at him
he hurries over
where have you been
you missed my shining moment
i won the macaroni sundae binge
im sorry honey

mickey is cleaning off hallies face
i dont want you to choke or anything but youre trailing

she swats him
sid and derek stand arm in arm watching the next round
complete throw away any news
the forbidden subject
he shakes his head
suddenly a frat boy pops into the room
yo guys outside
somethings up at the chi omega
police are everywhere
people begin to stand moving to the windows and front door
sidney looks to derek
everyone comes flying out of the front door and into the yard as police cars whip by
two doors down sits the chi omega house crawling with police ambulances reporters
yo lets check it out
the entire crowd takes off in droves down the street
all except for
they stand on the porch watching as the street becomes a circus
captain tyler the sheriff police fbi
the house is crawling
dewey sifts around on his own checking things out
captain tyler and the sheriff stand at the shattered glass door
lots of blood
but no body
have you checked the
attic garage basement nothing
take the neighborhood
the sheriff turns to his men
alright men listen up
dewey is all ears
derek and sid stand on the porch his arms around her
her face is numb
its starting all over again
lemme take you home
ill get my jacket
sidney indifferent moves through the open front door back inside the house
her face and mind detached from whats going on
derek remains on the porch watching the spectacle
slowly the door behind him closes
sid moves through the living room she grabs her coat when the phone rings
she looks at it suspiciously
she reaches for it
low and haunting
sidney closes her eyes
when she opens them tears are immediate but still she refuses to crack
who are you
soon sidney soon
what do you want
to see every ounce of blood drain from your body
the voice has never sounded more evil
sidney doesnt flinch
she holds steady
then come and get me
and with that sidney hangs up the phone slamming it down
the voice comes from inside the room
sidney spins around and finds herself staring at the
but not the one from the movie theater
the one from sidneys nightmare long ago
it stands in the foyer archway staring at her
a sustained moment
a stand off
sidney doesnt move
but then the killer withdraws his trademark
a long steel hunting knife
as the ghost leaps at her
she screams dodging him derek hears her scream
he turns to the front door
he finds it locked
he starts to beat on it
sid just dodges the ghost just missing the knifes blade
she bolts through the living room to the front door
derek beats on it from outside
hes in the house
she struggles with the door there are too many locks the ghost is already upon her
she looks to the stairs thinks better of it
flies through the dining room
derek is going nuts trying to get into the house
he moves along the porch to the windows looking through
he watches as the ghost figure chases her into the kitchen
derek looks about the porch
he rears his foot back and kicks in the window
sid moves through the kitchen to the back door
she struggles with the lock as the ghost is right behind her
she barely makes it out the back door
a large fenced in yard
lots of big oak trees
sid flies down the back porch and into the yard
she moves across it passed trees and shrubs
she spots a closed fence door in the back of the yard
she looks behind her to find
she scans the yard the ghost figure has completely disappeared
she moves behind a big tree hiding behind it
sid stops catches her breath then peers from behind the tree
the yard is completely empty
she goes for the fence door slowly moving around the tree
a noise in the darkness
she spins around still making her way around the tree moving backwards walking right into a figure
she screams spinning around finding herself face to face with
hanging dangling hung from the tree her stomach a ripped bloody mess
sidney screams in unforgettable horror
she steps back falling right into the arms of
she turns screaming
its just me
he takes her into his arms comforting her as she holds on for dear life
the early sun casts light upon an otherwise dark and joyless morning as the blood stained campus slowly comes to life
the local campus security office has been converted into a media event
news trucks cameras and reporters stand guard outside while inside
the place is packed
no longer just a campus security office
the place has been converted to the local police station as well as fbi headquarters
uniforms and suits swarm the place
in a back section of the room sheriff hartley and captain tyler are in a huge discussion with dean fisher
tempers are heated
its been a sleepless night for all
we dont know if its random
we havent been able to connect the victims
the first two were stabbed without thought
the sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision
just do something
i will not have a repeat of gainesville
not on my campus
dewey listens to this exchange slowly stepping forward
sidney prescott sir
they both turn to him
shes the connection
we know that son
the killer was trying to get to her
that sorority girl was a distraction
were aware of that
sheriff hartley steps forward
the killer is obviously repeating woodsboro
i can fill you in on what i know
dewey is not a welcome participant
captain tyler pulls dewey aside
i know youve lived through this but we got it under control
why dont you have some coffee
just then gale weathers appears being ushered in by two uniforms
dean fisher greets her with smiles the fbi and local police fawn over her
thank you miss weathers for coming in
of course what can i do
captain tyler gives dewey a patronizing pat on the back sending him off
we were hoping you could help with the killers profile
deweys face couldnt be more burned
a chalk board in front of them
three names are written on it under the label victims maureen evans phil gale is at the chalk board maureen evans maureen prescott
sidney prescotts mother
the first victim in the woodsboro murders
phil stevens stephen orth the first kid to be murdered
ten to one cici is not the third victims real name
nickname cassie or casey
the third victim in woodsboro
she was hung from a tree and gutted
the room goes quiet
dewey watches from the back of the room
his eyes burning holes into gale
this is a complete copycat
your killer is even going in sequence
captain tyler sits up
who was the next victim in woodsboro
in the book or in the movie
lets try reality
himbry the principal was the next victim
however in the movie version tatum riley was killed next
captain tyler flies out of his seat and into action
to his men find me every variation of himbry and what was the other name
dewey speaks up
his voice soft but heard
the entire room stares at him knowingly
gales eyes find his
he looks away
both on campus and the surrounding community
i want names asap
ill get you full access
the room breaks into a fury as they jump into action
gale stops captain tyler
what about sidney
is she safe
shes completely insulated
ive got my top men on her
sid derek hallie mickey and joel lounge among pillows and blankets
the remains of a sleepover
joel parts the blinds
two plains clothed policemen are in view milling about outside standing guard
how many guys they have on you
i counted four
hallie reads from a notebook in her hand
okay youre sure about skipping calculas
please i have the perfect excuse
what about rehearsal
ill cover you through rehearsal
derek when do you get outta docu drama
so youll relieve me at
and watch her til ive got to edit
ill be outta micro bio and we can grab a bite
guys guys im sorry but no way
mickey you and i can take her late evening
sig eps gotta band tonight
this is exactly what i dont want
i think its out of your control
derek puts his arms around her pulling her close
mickey and hallie argue about this evening
joel moves out the door
sid ill seeya tonight
derek kisses her sweetly
my screwed up life shouldnt have to bleed onto my friends
let us decide that
what about your film
isnt it due next week
have you even started it
its under control
he kisses her again
a huge one stop for students
comprised of several open floors it looks like a mini mall
a cafeteria book store movie theatre arcade etc
fill the place
gale moves through the lobby area when she sees debbie salt heading her off
she tries to bolt but shes not fast enough
hi gale any leads
tons and tons
where is sidneys father
home where he lives
and are the police sure about that
why dont you ask them
hes the perfect suspect dont you think
no i dont
parents are always responsible
it all starts in the home
look i know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win
im not interested in the scoop anymore
gale charges off moving to a nearby newsstand
the tabloid papers exploit whats going on
crazy headlines about the murders dominate the newsrack
gale is clearly bothered by this
just then a phone rings
she pulls it from her pocket
its the killer
his voice is unmistakable
who is this
ill give you one guess
gale knows immediately
she looks around for help
a campus cop is across the lobby
who are you
thats not the way we play the game
i dont play games
what if your life depended on it
gale gets testy with him
what do you want
youre pretty when youre angry
gale stops cold
she looks around
the place is alive with people
he could be anywhere
where are you
she continues moving to the campus cop
oh a god complex stay away from the cop
a deadly warning
she plays it cool
she looks above her to the upper floor
students hang over a balcony
what do you want from me
its what you want from me
what do you mean
you are writing another book arent you
thats why youre here
the storys not over
youre getting obvious
no gale im just getting started
watch your back
the phone goes dead
gale spins around doing quick circle to make sure no ones around her
she turns and heads off right into
they both gasp
a large tiered theatre
seats five hundred
old but preserved and updated
a rehearsal is in progress
several actors stand stage center running lines as stagehands work on the set around them
sidney is one of them
she moves around the stage very animated
more alive than ever
she dons a russian accent
a promising actress
in character pain yah such pain
an awkward silence
everyone looks at each other
finally lois the bitchy sorority girl speaks up
thats not the line
about a page
off stage cut
lets take five
the actors break up as sidney frustrated walks across a make shift bridge that takes her across the orchestra pit and down the stairs into the house where hallie sits
sids bodyguards can be seen sitting scattered about
that was good
the director mid s intelligent friendly
sid why dont you get outta here
well pick this up tomorrow
sid nods in agreement
the director smiles at her
work on the accent
she grabs her things and heads off with hallie when
sid turns to find randy moving through an aisle
he had been watching rehearsal
sids face tenses
who is that guy
look hallie ill meet you outside
no girletta i dont leave your side
ive got my entourage
take a break
sid is definite
hallie backs off heading up the aisle against her better wishes
what do you want
im sorry sid please
i never should have gone along with gale
i know im stupid
i wish i had some good reason to give you but im just stupid
please sid dont be mad at me
do you work for her now
she gave me a job
it got me outta woodsboro
im sorry about cotton and yesterday
it was a bad idea
i knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea
ah shit sid im fucked up
sidney looks at him long and hard a smile slowly appearing
he nods knowingly
wanna get outta here
gale and dewey are with captain tyler and sheriff evans
if he calls again find help
dont engage him in conversation
im gonna put a man on you to cover you
i can do it captain
thanks dewey but i was thinking id pull jesse off
id prefer dewey captain
tyler doesnt argue
hes too crazed
dewey avoids gales stare
hows the name search going
usages of himbry located in the registars office
and thats just on campus
a movie is in progress
a young girl looking a lot like tori spelling runs down a school corridor
she runs smack into a young handsome boy
he could very well be johnny depp
in movie oh god billy you scared me
what are you doing here
in movie they let me go sid i didnt do it
sid and randy sit in the small cineplex mall type theatre
behind them sit sids trusting police guards
sidney shifts in her seat
you okay sid
tori spelling and johnny depp continue their dramatic discussion
when my mom left my dad i accepted it
thats just the way the cookie crumbles
yeah but your mom left town
shes not dead
my moms dead
do you hear me
and shes never coming back
sidney grows increasingly uneasy
mickey joel and derek are crowded around a table in the student union cafeteria
my documentary is due on tuesday
whats your subject
you should of done it on sidney
that would have been a cool
she wouldnt let me
not with primetime live and coming at her
id save my shit too
hallie comes waltzing up
damned if i know
she ditched me
you werent supposed to leave her alone
i didnt say she was alone
that guy from her home town showed up
they went off together
hallie plops down giving mickey a big kiss
ive been waiting for you baby
is that cool
just to leave her like that
shes got guards with her
he was with sid that night in woodsboro
her old boyfriend
no she killed her boyfriend
randy was a friend
watch out derek
he tried to kill her first
is sid in therapy
she was for a while
gave it up
how do you know so much about her
i read the book
i could use some therapy
should we be worried about this guy
isnt it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying
he seemed harmless
arent most serial killers seemingly harmless
easy black boy
most serial killers are attractive slightly off white males in their twenties
thats you honey
hallie kisses mickey again
i got a surprise for you
suddenly he leaps up on the cafeteria table and begins to sing at the top of his lungs
if i should stay
i would only be in your way
so ill go
and yet i know ill think of you each step of the way
dont do this
and iiiiiiiiiyeiiiii will always love you oooooowuoooooooo will always love you
everyone has taken notice
they begin to cheer and sing with him
to derek whitney
i think hes doing dolly
and i hope life treats you kind and i hope you have all you dreamed of offffff
i wish you joyyy
hallie cant help but be touched
he finishes up ending on a last final note
as he does he pulls a necklace from around his neck
his greek letters dangle from it
he places them around her neck kissing her
isnt that a big no no
i think so
hallie breaks away
she swats him
youre going to get it
you know what happens
but i love you
and i want the whole world to know it
hallie smiles her eyes misty
derek and joel eye each other
sid and randy continue watching the movie
the guards behind them are way engrossed
its the end of the movie
tori spelling is running for her life from two killers johnny depp and his sidekick
she finds herself trapped in the kitchen
johnny depp holds the knife up to toris face
why did you kill my mother
because she was sleeping with my dad
shes the reason my mom left
she was a whore just like you
these words sting sid
randy notices her flinching
my mom was no whore
dont you say that
tori starts to cry
tears find their way down sidneys cheeks
johnny depp and his murderous sidekick start stabbing each other
its the perfect alibi sidney
just like in the movies
sidney cant take it anymore
she gets up and races out of the theatre
sid emerges from the theatre and into the lobby
she moves into a curtained section where the water fountain is
she looks up and sees randy flying out of the theatre
he exits outside looking for her
the cops are right behind him
sidney spins around
cotton weary stands before her
shoulders slumped his face pained
can we talk
i dont think thats a good idea
look yesterday wasnt my idea
that was all gale and dollar signs and ratings
what do you want from me cotton
you could start with an apology
i did that
you wrote me a letter
what could i say that would make a difference
i took away a year of your life how do i apologize for that
i wish it was just a year
i lost everything because of you
i have nothing now
look at me this is what ive become
a long silence
sidney is hanging on by threads
cotton there isnt one day one hour one minute when im not reminded of what ive done
i have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what i feel in every vein of my being
and i wish i had in me what you need to hear but i dont think the words exist
i just thought if i saw you face to face maybe it would help
it helped me realize one thing
youre a self obsessed little cunt like your mother
and with that cotton flips on a dime
his face turns evil
sidney races by him as he throws out his arm stopping her just as
appear grabbing him from behind
they throw him against the wall retaining him
randy appears at sids side
sid nods as she watches the officers arrest him
they do a body search pulling from his coat a large revolver
cotton just smiles
sid and randy walk up the steps to the school library
the ever helping guards behind them
i dont know
i dont think cotton did it
its too predictable
if hes innocent hell have an alibi
i guess gales going to be pissed she missed her exclusive
ill relay it
you sure you dont wanna go home
i have this button i press
it insulates me
she mimes an air lock valve
i gotta coupla of those buttons myself
theres something sad about this exchange
these two people understand each other thanks for the movie randy
sorry it sucked
it just had that been there done that feeling
sidney watches as randy shoves off disappearing across campus
sid turns to find derek leaning against a pole
i had the four oclock shift
you werent there
you had us worried
is everything okay
no its not
i dont really know what happened in woodsboro sid
but i know you dont trust me
its not you derek
i dont trust myself
i tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men
then ill make this easy for you
i like you
im crazy about you sid
but im gonna stay away
until you say otherwise
a long moment
he looks at her hoping shell say otherwise
im sorry derek
so thats how its going to be
he turns and wanders off not looking back once
the newsvan is parked at a curb
it sits out of the way overlooking the student commons area
a grassy area where students sit and conjugate
gale walks back and forth with the cellular attached to her ear
dewey sits leans against the van watching her
he still has a crush but hides it as best he can
on phone the interviews not going to happen
changed my mind
ive harassed the girl enough
its in poor taste and a bad idea
your entire career is in poor taste
gotta go call me when you have something nice to say
gale hangs up she looks to dewey
so what made you change your mind about sidney
im manic depressive
youre a hard one to figure out
its that complex yet shallow quality
i think youre all an act
and deep down im a good person
make no mistake dewey im a shit
i know that
i also know that youre an aging tv reporter slash writer who despite huge tabloid success has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional
life in a non positive manner
a coupla failed relationships with im guessing balding older men have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone
but i bet sometimes late at night when youre all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want
is to be touched and held and fondled
gale stares at him stunned
a moment as the tension swirls about them
and where did you gain all of your gale weathers insight
dewey approaches her
gale has never been more taken with him
they stand incredibly close
after my spinal cord was damaged i was laid up for over a year
a lot can happen when youre on your back
theyre nearly touching now
just then randy approaches
whatd i miss
gale backs away from dewey breathless
her cellular phone rings
she eyes dewey then hands it to randy
im not here
randy takes the phone
shes not here right now
but shes standing right next to you
randy motions to gale and dewey
he points around campus mouthing hes watching
gale grabs dewey
to randy keep him talking
gale and dewey race off across the grassy area where students come and go
he holds the phone scared not knowing what to say
whats your favorite scary movie
theyll never find me
randy eyes dewey and gale they move through students searching
what do you care
let em have their fun
so whats up
whats your favorite scary movie
wait let me guess
am i close
closer than you think
they move through passing students
he has to be nearby
he likes the game
dewey is on the his walkie
i need back up
he has a hard time keeping up with gale
he hobbles along
he goes on a tirade pacing back and forth
so whats your deal
can we talk openly for a second
how does one become a serial killer
are you psychopathic or merely psychotic
and what is the distinguishing feature
were you slapped around as a child
is it hereditary
did your mom take test drugs
you know have you tried getting laid
its done wonders for my homicidal tendencies
do you want to die
gee let me think
do you want to
is that the best you can do
some tired hand me down rehash
hey pal no ones gonna write a book about you
no movie rights
ive been through this before and much better i might add
gale spots a young man sitting with some other kids
hes talking on a cellular phone
she races to him and rips it from his hands
he leaps up ready to pounce on her
randy wont let up
he continues dissing
and if youre such a brilliant smart killer why copycat
why not be original
wheres the innovation
lets pioneer some new ground
make a statement
go down in history
now youll always be the woodsboro copycat killer
its like a bad sequel
and why woodsboro
what about manson bundy son of sam
why imitate two high school loser ass dickheads knew the guys
stu was a wussy ass wet rag and billy jesus what a rat looking homo repressed mamas boy
suddenly the newsvan door rips open a ghost masked figure lunges out grabbing randy by the neck
the move is quick and precise
a hard yank and randy is wrenched back into the newsvan
the door slams shut
as they run back to the newsvan
sirens are heard in the distant
gale races up to find randy nowhere
where did he go
dewey circles the van as gale moves to the sliding side door
she tears it open as
randys body falls out
his throat slit
gales scream is heard all over campus
yellow tape has been placed around the newsvan
people have gathered as randys body is taken out on a stretcher
captain tyler and sheriff hartley share frustrated faces
hes broken his pattern
theyve broken their pattern
youre sure about this two person thing
broad daylight a crowded movie theatre
this is too much fun for one person
different uniforms whirl by
i would say we are now officially baffled
on national television
sheriff hartley looks up as reporters flock them surrounding them in questions
a room of the library sectioned off exclusively for computer use
it consists of thirty to forty cubicles that house computer terminals
every cubicle is full
the place is packed
sid sits at a terminal busy at work
her two police guards wander up and down the cubicles keeping an eye out
her face appears concentrated focused
she scans the computer screen in front of her
sid is typing feverishly
suddenly her screen starts flashing and beeping freezing her words
confused she tries to make it stop but it wont
she leans back turning to the guy next to her
a handsome young man
did your computer just freeze
the guy leans over and takes a look at sids monitor
you have an instant message thats all
just hit alt m
im not signed on
someone here in the room
all the terminals are connected
the guy returns to his own computer
sidney eyes the screen suspiciously
she hits alt m
a message pops up on the screen
a muffled cry
she shoots up looking about the crowded room
he could be anywhere
the two guards take notice rushing over to her
hes in the room right now
she points to the screen
the men instantly break up and cover the room
they start pulling people from their terminals to check their screens
sidney backs away from her screen her terror growing
suddenly it starts flashing and beeping again
she looks around
she slowly moves toward it drawn uncontrollably
she hits alt m
another message pops up its stone pale
she takes a deep breath and begins to type
the words fuck you appear
sid hits send
captain tyler and sheriff hartley are drilling a very subdued and cool cotton
what better alibi could i have
i was here in custody
maybe you dont work alone
yeah thats it
why did you attack sidney prescott
there was no attack we were talking
miss prescott and i have a very complicated past
thats no crime
and the gun
i have a permit
i have a legal right to carry it
why do you need a gun
gentlemen your growing hysteria is not reason enough to hold me here
ive been down this road before
and unless youre going to charge me with a crime id like to walk outta here
i have an interview at
gale sits at a table
he places a hand on her shoulder
theyre both at a loss
how you doin
how you doin
just then the sheriff and captain emerge from their office
cotton is escorted out behind them
gale moves to him
cant we hold him
no we got pressure from california state
the man practically has clemency
we cant run the risk of falsely accusing him
he has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move
he stands at a counter signing forms
whats going on cotton
you know the story gale
man falsely accused sent to prison proved innocent released back into the real world and never trusted again
want the exclusive
did you do it
she looks him dead in the eyes
now gale you were so instrumental in my freedom
youre not having character doubts now are you
you have a right to be angry
no gale i dont have any rights
you made sure of that
cotton ive done nothing but help you
youve done nothing but get rich off of me
how many books have you sold gale
you think i dont understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights
just then the officer behind the counter brings him his gun in a plastic bag
cotton takes it out and checks it over
gale is surprised to see the gun
dont do anything stupid cotton
youve come to far
gale i dont know what im doing from one moment to the next
im just taking it as it comes
cotton pockets the gun and heads out
gale rejoins dewey and the others
i think its time to beef up security on the prescott girl
where is she
she was just escorted to her dorm room
is she safe there
were going to bring her in
hide her out for a coupla days
and were issuing a campus lock in this evening
no one is allowed out after dark
that doesnt work sir
youre just isolating people
youre giving the killer a blank canvas
day turns to night and college life comes to a deadly stand still as everyone observes the imposed campus restrictions
the fraternity house sits dark and quiet
a young man walks up the walk to the front door
he taps on it three times and it quietly opens as hes ushered in
the young man makes his way down a long hallway down a spiral staircase through a thick basement door and into
music peels paint as young college students rock to deafening tunes
a row of kegs line one wall as a the party gears up for a drunken night ahead
derek is seen with his video camera
hes filming lois and murphy
they talk into the camera
both tipsy chatty
its all about sisterhood
everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but
we only promote safe rubbered sex
its really about family and tradition
harmonica style is okay
i just love being a sister
mickey approaches as derek finishes up
they take off to the kegs
are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of greek life
not one bit
she dumped me
hes clearly upset by it when from out of nowhere several frat boys appear picking mickey up lifting him over their heads
everyone starts cheering and clapping
they carry him around the room chanting
the frat boys abduct mickey taking him up the stairs and out sight
others lookie loos follow
derek grabs his camera and bolts
sidney is trying to focus on homework while hallie channel surfs
she finds a channel
on screen siskel a ebert are reviewing a movie
from tv i enjoyed its clever execution
were missing the sig ep party
no hallie not tonight
parties and mass murderers dont go together
no no i hadnt planned on going its just mickey will be pissed
hallie clearly wishes she were there
from tv it was just an excuse to kill young big breasted girls
i didnt like it
theyre reviewing stab
hallie switches channels
theres a knock on the door
sid answers its dewey and gale
from the look on their faces
someone else has been killed
gobs of gooey food goes flying through the air exploding perfectly all over
who stands buck naked tied
chained to a tree in the back yard
the yard is crowded with frat boys and sorority girls who delight in torching him
mounds of syrup eggs and other wet and slimy food is plunged upon him
who do you love
did you say my tke brothers
no i said hallie
more food and slime come barreling at him
a drunk lois and murphy pull the police tape down from the previous nights crime scene and begin to mayflower him
the crowd goes crazy
hallie consoles sidney
dewey and gale nearby
sidney is a stone rock
its frightening to watch her hold it together
i wish people would stop treating me like glass
im not gonna break
its okay to break girl
you shatter if you have to
id really just like to be alone
the police are waiting outside
theyre going to take you somewhere safe
dewey theres no such place
humor me sid
sidney starts packing an overnight bag
can i come with her
no hallie im not gonna take you down too
ill be alright
sid ill come with you
but who would operate your camera
it comes out of nowhere
gale goes silent
a knock at the door
dewey opens to find a police guard standing with joel
hes cool remy
joel is ushered in
he says his hellos moving to hallie
gale and dewey move out into the hall with the guards
sid continues to pack
her face rigid
they got mickey
hes being toasted at the deltas
i knew it
i gotta get over there
were under quarantine
he points to dewey who talks to gale in the hallway
im the only one who can cut him down
its not a good idea hallie
ill go with her
be safe girl
she gives sidney a hug before she can object then she and joel race out into the hallway as dewey sticks his head in
sid you should get going
he looks at joel and hallie
where are you two headed
instant cover hallie forgot her footage at the film dept
im gonna walk her over before its gets too late you really
i gotta have it dewey
gale steps in
hallie and joel race outta there before any more objections
dewey turns to gale
if you were truly a copycat wouldnt you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could
hes already gotta be a part of sids life
what do you know about this derek
he was with sidney when she was attacked
billy had alibis too
dewey turns to sid who now stands ready in the doorway
hey i got stuff to do
but ill find you later okay
sidneys exterior keeps hardening
mickey is still tied to the tree
hes so completely covered in hardened gook it looks like hes wearing clothes
the last of the crowd has left
theyve gone back to the party
he stands shivering in the cold
he checks the chain that holds him secure
its composed of several bike locks and steel twine
hes not going anywhere
he hears a noise
he looks to the nearby shrubs and beyond
just a noise of the night
whispering come on hallie baby
a dark room
a slight disturbance at the door and it comes popping open
light from the hall floods the room as dewey and gale slip in and close the door behind them
checking door you broke the lock
you broke my heart
what are we looking for
a bloody knife
a ghost mask
something like that
can we turn the light on
thats not the way its done
dewey pulls out his flashlight and begins to search the room
he sifts through drawers and a closet
and its sexier in the dark
dewey you and i would never make it
but think about the sex
as frustrated as i am
and as lonely as i am
wed break some furniture
gale laughs at this
she reaches over and pats his buttock
tell you what
we get through this one
and well take out a hotel room
over here with the light
dewey points the light to a framed picture
its of joel and derek a buddy pose
she sifts through some text books on the desk
and joels pre med
the sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision
its both of them
the first murders were to throw us using the same names as woodsboro
but theyve moved on theyre getting closer to sidney
theyre not looking for a himbry or a tatum to kill
theyre looking for the new tatum
then in a splash theyre outta there
a squad car makes its way down the quiet campus street
sidney sits in the backseat
the two police officers ride in front
where are you taking me
actually i dont know
were meeting another car that will transport you the rest of the way
i feel like eddie murphy
the car comes to a halt in front of a stop light
we feel like kevin costner
sidney smiles at this just as the car door rips open on the passengers side
two hands reach in and yank police guard from the car
he starts to cry out but its cut short
sid screams as the police guard behind the wheel struggles with his seat belt
he looks up to see a ghost masked figure move around the side of the car towards his door
he reaches for his gun but its too late
the ghost has the door open
a flash of silver and the police guards throat is slit
sidney screams and screams beating on the door of the car
it wont open
shes trapped like a caged animal
the ghost pulls the police guard from the car then gets in behind the drivers seat
the ghost puts the car in drive and takes off down the road
sidney looks behind her as the guards dead bodies lay sprawled in the middle of the road
she turns to the door beating and clawing at it
she leans back manic and kicks at the window with her feet
the car makes its way down the deserted street sidney is beyond frantic
she eyes the ghost through the gate
she turns and twists looking for an escape
through the window she sees approaching headlights
she screams through the closed window as a car passes by
sidney takes notice as the car turns onto another campus street
big stone school buildings line each side of a thin road
she eyes the ghost through the rearview window
the white masks turns as hidden eyes bore through her
the ghost hits the gas picking up speed
sidney looks to the book bag on the seat beside her
she rips it open rustling through it frantically
she pulls books pencils paper
sid grabs a long yellow no
she grips it hard looking to the metal grate just behind the drivers seat
the ghosts neck is right up against it
sid takes the pencil and positions it right behind the ghosts head ready to attack
without pause sid rams the pencil through the grate into the ghosts neck
it lodges there as the ghost falls forward in pain losing control of the wheel for a moment
the car jumps the curb and slams against a building
the ghost yanks the wheel over correcting
he tries to bring it back to the road but doesnt see the lamp post that stands directly in the cars path
the squad car makes direct contact with the lamp post slamming into it bringing the car to a crashing halt lodging it agaisnt the buildings stone exterior
smoke rises from a bashed engine as it emits a fatal rumbling
all is still
in the backseat sidney rises from the floorboards
she looks up to see the ghost masked figure slumped over the steering wheel
sid quickly pulls herself together looking about sizing up her options
she tugs on the door handle
it wont budge
she looks to the passengers side of the car
its flush against the building
then she notices the metal grate
the edge has been pried apart in the crash
sidney reaches for it pulling on it bending it backwards
sid tries to stifle the noise it makes all the while eyeing the ghost who remains unconscious
she creates an opening large enough for her to crawl through
she lifts herself up and pulls herself through to the
sid falls down into the seat her eyes never leaving the ghost
she lay crumpled up against the smashed passengers door the only sound is her own terrified breathing
she watches the ghost masked figure
his body doesnt move
she contemplates her next move
the only way out is through the drivers door
after what seems an eternity she slowly reaches over with her foot and nudges the ghost
she slides across the seat towards the ghost moving to his side
she reaches with her hand and pushes on the ghosts shoulder
his body moves slumping back against the back of the seat
it clears space for her to pass through
she sits up on her feet facing the ghost
with her leg she reaches over him straddling him
she leans against the steering wheel her arm quickly reaching for the door knob
her back brushes against the horn
sid tenses her face a little more than a foot from the ghost mask
he doesnt move
hes completely out cold
sid pushes the car door open and starts to slide completely over the ghost when she stops
she looks to the ghost
as she fights with a decision
then with a fierce determination sid reaches for the ghost mask
she finds the edge and begins to peels the mask away when
sidney screams leaping falling out the car door
sid hits the pavement hard
she lifts herself up when her entire body is yanked violently backwards
the ghost has hold of her foot pulling her back into the car
sidney kicks and writhes breaking free
she hops to her feet as the ghost emerges from the car
sidney slams the car door shut
it catches the ghost knocking him backwards
sid tears off down the street running burning up the pavement
the film school sits in the still darkness
dewey and gale move down a dark and shadowed hallway
they stop cold
what was that
lets find out
dewey keeps moving
this is all too familiar
dewey has lead her to a door marked lecture hall
the same room seen earlier
a large rounded room with three levels of seats that shoot straight up to the ceiling
a podium stands center
video monitors hang from the ceiling in different places around the room
dewey and gale enter
if not for the red exit signs that hang over the exit doors the room would be completely dark
they move down the first level of chairs to the lecturn
maybe they never got here
he could have taken her anywhere
a noise from above takes their attention
they looks up as a video monitor comes to life
home made video footage fills the screen
a movie theatre people standing in line
the home camera zooms in to a young couple
maureen and phil come into view
gale watches the screen as dewey looks around the room searching for its source
another monitor comes to life
more home shot video footage
this time of a big house
a closer look reveals it to be the chi omega sorority house
a young girl stands on the front porch talking on a portable phone
he filmed his victims
its randy standing outside the newsvan with the cellular phone to his ear
another monitor turns on
its of a man and woman back to the camera
the couple move in frame
it becomes apparent quick
its gale and dewey
as they stand in the room live
theyre being taped
dewey spins around
he reaches for the gun he no longer carries
he looks around the room up to the two levels above them
he spots a small light on the second level
he squints his eyes and sees a figure standing behind it
no wait here
dewey hands her his flashlight and takes off for the stair rise that leads to the upper level
no dewey lets call for backup
but dewey is gone leaving gale alone
she turns to the monitor to see her face in fear stricken closeup
dewey moves fast limping his way to the levels edge
he approaches the railing and makes his way around to the shining light
he reaches it finding nothing but a camera and tripod
it sits alone against the railing
dewey surveys the second level
empty seats everywhere
dewey looks down to the main floor
to gale who looks up to him
im coming down
dewey turns to leave his eye catching a monitor that hangs level with the railing
on the monitor gale is in frame looking up at dewey her face fear stained
she takes a step forward moving out of frame revealing who stands right behind her
dewey looks down to see the ghost standing directly behind gale
gale turns just in time to see the gleam of a killers knife as it darts out of the darkness
gale catapults just dodging it
she moves like lightning up the aisle of seats
dewey races for the stairs going as fast as his handicapped leg will allow
gale tears out the exit door the killer right behind her
dewey arrives searching looking for gale
he eyes the exit door as it slowly closes
he moves for it
gale races down the hallway eyeing the nearest door
she tears it open disappearing into
gale finds herself in the student studios
she stands in a huge control booth that overlooks a dubbing stage
lots of glass walls and doors
it has a maze quality
gale moves out a side door and into a dubbing room
darkness everywhere gale stops for a second listening as she main door creaks open
and then footsteps are heard making their way towards her
gale proceeds deeper into the studio
she moves into a sound proof room and closes the door
not seeing the
that stands behind her
she turns around and screams
she starts out but then realizes hes standing in the control booth
shes protected by a clear large plexiglass window that wraps around the room
the ghost moves out the side door heading her way
he disappears out of view
she races to the door trying to secure it
theres no lock
dewey slips through quietly trying his best to be quick on his toes
through the control booth window he immediately spots gale
gale looks for objects to block the door with
she drags a shelf of sound equipment towards the door
dewey moves to the window
she doesnt hear him
the room is sound proof
he beats against the glass
still she doesnt turn to him
gale shoves everything she can find against the door not seeing or hearing dewey as he pounds against the sound proof barrier behind her
she also doesnt see the killer that appears behind dewey
he moves on him swift and focused
gale cant take her eyes off the door
her face is terrified
if shed only turn around she would see dewey his face terror stricken as a knife is hurled into him repeatedely
with each thrust blood is splattered against the glass
dewey screams for his life caught completely off guard
he falls forward onto the control panels
suddenly microphone feedback tears through the studios as deweys cries are heard throughout the stage
deweys death scream rips through the room
gale turns to the window to see dewey his face smashed against it blood smeared across the glass
she moves to the window her face only inches from his
a moment as their eyes meet
deweys life is near gone
his eyes reveal it
gale beats against the glass window
through tears deweys body slides down out of view
gale is mortified
she looks to the killer who has already made his way through the control booth
hes coming for her
she races to the door throws the things away
she manages to pull the door open just enough to slide through
and shes off and running
gale finds a door and plows through it stopping only long enough to lock it
the ghost rams it from the other side but it holds
gale surveys her surroundings
shes in a storage room
she eyes another door
she moves through it and out into
gale shoots down it
sidney races down the deserted street
not a soul in sight
she reaches a corner moves off the road and passes through a series of trees and shrubs coming out onto
the houses have long since gone to sleep
the delta zeta house stares at sidney
lights burn from within
sid goes for it
sid makes her way up the front porch
she pounds on the front door screaming her lungs out
sid wastes no time she moves along the wraparound porch beating at the windows
everybody is off partying
suddenly sid hears something
she turns to find murphy and lois laying strewn across the end of the porch
sid runs to them
oh god help me
we have to call the police
sid kneels over murphy shaking her
murphys eyes open and she giggles
the girl is completely wasted
she has no comprehension skills at all
do you have keys
i need to get inside
sid looks to lois
shes in worse shape
sid contemplates not knowing what to do
she leaves them moving down off the porch and around to the back of the house
she gets to the back door tries it
its locked too
sidney checks out the yard
off to the side she spots a big tree with a
body lying next to it in a heap on the ground she moves toward it
as sid approaches she sees clearly that its mickey
he lay on his side curled knees to chest his arm still chained to the tree
a look of dread creeps across her face
he lay there very much dead
oh god no mickey
she kneels over his body just as it stirs lifting up rising
mickeys face comes into view coated in dried funk his eyes wide
jesus wheres hallie
ive been here all night
listen to me
weve got to get help
the killers here
what are you talking about
hes after me
mickey pulls on his chained arm
youve got to cut me down sid
sid inspects the chain
its meant to hold
ill be right back
where you going
sidney moves to the shed thats attached to the garage
leaning against the side are a row of garden tools
sid settles on a shovel
sid returns to mickey who has risen to his feet
hes pulling and twisting the bike chain that binds him
sid lifts the shovel up and brings it down directly on the lock
it bends somewhat but stays in tact
do it again
a noise behind them
they both spin around peering into the night
what was that
sidney determined raises the shovel high and brings it down with great force
it cracks the lock loosening it
mickey pulls on it
it wont quite give
sid raises the shovel again unfaltering
she doesnt see the ghost masked figure that slides down from the tree branch behind her
the figure moves quickly and gracefully coming to a stance directly behind sid
mickey looks up just in time
sid turns just as the killer strikes
but sid is ready
without thought she swings the shovel at the ghost catching his mid section sending him flying
mickey goes ballistic chained to the tree
he pulls twists squirms
anything to free himself
the ghost rises moving on mickey
sidney sees this
sidney distracts the ghost
she takes off the ghost following her
she moves around the tree sprinting across the yard running smack into
but sidney spins around as two ghosts appear on each side of her
she stands thunderstruck as the two killers descend on her
she dives between the two but they counter keeping her surrounded
sid watches as one of the ghosts withdraws his knife
she turns to the other
his knife is already poised
they close in on her ready to strike
she looks for an escape
theres not one
suddenly mickey appears barreling into one of the ghosts
they go sprawling across the grass
sidney makes her break she runs passed them towards the front of the yard
mickey leaps to his feat
the killer right behind him
he now finds himself in sids predicament
he doesnt know where to run
the two killers close in on him
sidney gets to the corner of the house
she doesnt want to leave mickey
she turns back around just in time to see
mickey sandwiched in between the two ghosts
theyre knives strike at the same time
one through the stomach the other through the back
they withdraw their knives
mickeys body suspends momentarily hanging in the air
then collapses to a heap on the ground
both ghosts turn to sid at the same time
she takes off running along the side of the house through a row of shrub that take her to
sid is back on the campus street running down the middle of it
she spots a car stopped at a red light half a block up
kids are inside rock music blares
sid screams and screams but they dont hear her
she runs feet pounding toward them but the light turns green and the car takes off
its taillights fading in the night
she turns finding herself alone in a parking lot
the theatre sits in the distance
she spots someone entering the theatre
it looks like hallie
but hallie doesnt hear her
sid races forward
gale races down the empty campus street
she eyes an emergency phone thats attached to a street lamp
she goes for it
gale rips the phone from its cradle presses the call button
from phone what is your emergency please
someones trying to kill me
i need the police
are you in danger now
where is your attacker
i dont know
stay under the safety light
help is on its way
the safety what
just then gale hears a noise
a door opening
she looks up to see sidney disappear through the side theatre door
but sidney has already disappeared inside
gale yells into the phone
gale throws the phone down and tears off for sidney
the theatre is big and old
plush chairs balcony huge proscenium stage
sidney enters through a side house door
she pulls on it releasing the emeregency lock
she makes her way down the aisle toward the orchestra section
the stage is dark and bare with the exceptions of the furniture from the deathtrap set
a noise from the stage wings
sidney moves down front to the little bridge that extends out over the orchestra pit
she crosses it and moves to stage center peering into the wings on either side of her
something drips down from above and onto sidney
she wipes it from her face when
a spot light turns on from the back of the house illuminating sid center stage
she jumps at this unnerved
she looks to her hand covered in crimson
then out to the house
the light is blinding
a noise from above
ropes pulleys moving
sid looks up as a set wall comes plowing down at her
she leaps out of the way falling to the floor
the wall falls into place on the stage
it is the back wall of the set thats dressed with framed pictures and antique weapons and
who hangs from it pinned up against the wall very much deadk arms outstretched crucified
his body a bloody mess
sidney stops stunned
she stands frozen in unspeakable horror
her entire being ripped apart
she breaks into tears
sid backs up moving racing toward the wings when another wall flies in sealing the backstage area off trapping her
she looks in shock at
strung up her body hanging lifeless
sid screams turning running to the other side of the stage when a third wall comes flying in creating the three walled set of deathtrap
attached to it is the body of joel
and then sid hears
a single pair of hands from somewhere in the house
she turns around and spots a figure moving down the aisle
she cant make out who it is
she spots the set door up center near deweys body
she goes for it ripping it open to find
but then sees his face he looks scared
and then cottons body falls forward to the floor his arms and legs bound by electric tape
sid turns back to the front of the stage
the figure is now walking across the bridge holding something
a light attached to a video camera
shes being filmed
sid looks back to cotton who looks up to her with pleading eyes
quick untie me
sid is paniced
she doesnt know what to do
she leans down to untie him but stops
from behind video camera youve seen this movie before havent you
sidney looks to the voice
the camera is pulled away to reveal
he smiles at her
smile for the camera
sidney remains silent
side backs away from cotton
she doesnt trust either one of them
derek watches her amused
go on untie him
this is a set up
please sidney hes going to kill us
derek begins filming again
you must be dealing with some serious trust issues right about now
sidney says nothing
she egdes away moving to the wall where hallie hangs
sidney you cant keep your back to the audience like that
could you cheat a little forward for me
youre really stumped arent you
you know theres two killers but you dont know who they are
im a given
but now youre torn
everyone else appears to be dead
except for cotton
suddenly hallie comes to life behind sid reaching out grabbing her
she spins around to find hallie breaking out in a torrent of giggles
very much alive
yah such pain
the story of your life sid
sidney stares in mortal shock as hallie cuts herself down from the wall with a big hunting knife
need some help honey
i got it
sidneys eyes go back and forth between the two
you should really see your face right now sid
its doing some freaky shit
sids face appears completely tortured
yeah you look quizzical yet pensive
yeah how can we help
do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life
sidney stares them down
shes been here before
you took the bait
ever see natural born killers
well derek and i have this whole mickey mallory woody harrelson juliette lewis thing going on
i really dont like that comparison honey
to sid he hates oliver stone
i find his work overwrought
sid is waning
cmon sid dont fade on us
weve been planning this baby for a year
sid turns to cotton
she kneels down and begins to untie him
you had your chance
derek dummy lunges at her with the knife
sid backs off
gale approaches the side theatre door
she pulls on it
she moves down along the theatre to another door
hallie and derek move around sid taking turns filming her with the camera
we met on the internet
he sent me the cutest e mail
i read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly
we have our own website now
we dedicated a whole page to you
youd me amazed at how many of us there are out there
its a whole world sid
youre really popular amongst the demented
youre the one who got away
you guys are fucked
actually cotton and i think critics would agree its the other way around
poor cotton could life be a little more cruel
youre not going to get away with this
of course not
who wants to
whats the point if we dont get caught
wheres the glamour in that
the way i see it
well be arrested
go to prison
cash in on the home footage
secure a book deal
if all goes as planned our trial should coincide with the release of stab ii
a verdict and premiere all on the same day
i love it
were hoping for the death penalty
i have this whole dead man walking swan song exit planned
and now drum roll please
hope youre ready sid
we got one last surprise for you
cotton pull and twists on his bound wrists
sid had loosened them somewhat
he tries to finish undoing them
a twist ending if you will
yeah we really had our work cut out for us
it really is the curse of the sequel
the billy stu things been done
so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience
and we didnt want to do that sid
we wanted to give you your moneys worth
so we found a compromise
or it found us
we have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings
just for you sid
wait a sec derek
we forgot to flip
derek reaches in his pocket for a coin
to sid we figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press
its been an ongoing discussion
to hallie heads or tails
he flips the coin
gale emerges from the lobby
she found a way in
she eyes the proceedings on stage
she sees sidney standing over cotton
and then hallie and derek on either side
knives in hand
she races down the aisle
they all turn spotting gale
sid moves forward happy to see her
gale moves down the aisle not sure whats going on
sidney moves down center
derek cuts her off just as
gale glimpsed the terror on sidneys face just as the curtain separates them
derek grabs sidney holding her the knife at her throat
its about time she showed up
gale moves to the exit door and into the
gale eyes a door thats marked stage door
she opens it and steps in coming face to face with a
gales eyes move down the end of the gun to find
standing lips pursed
hello gale weve been waiting for you
gales face is a mass of confusion
derek releases sidney shoving her she falls to her knees next to cotton
okay look you guys i applaud your methodical expertise but i have a question
whats going to happen after i die
i thought the heroine is supposed to live
not this time
hallie moves in on her
yeah were trying to send a message to hollywood
im really getting tired of all the happy endings
its just not reality
in the real world the good guys die the innocent are punished and the murderers inherit the earth
but nobody wants to see that
itll never go
theyll rewrite you
you dont want that
oh sid youre sounding desparate
i guess fearing death makes one anxious
you fucking freaked out movie nut psychos
off camera dont blame the movies sid
movies dont create pyschos
sid stops dead in her tracks as these words still her very soul
the voice comes from the wings
they all turn as gale weathers appears
behind her with gun in hand is debbie salt
derek grabs the camera
he doesnt want to miss a second
dont you know that by now
its about family
it all starts at home
it starts with the father
and the mother
sidney mouth drops her face aghast as she looks to debbie salt
she recognizes her immediately
gale stops cold
oh my god
gale turns to debbie salt
it cant be
told you we had a guest star
didnt see that coming did you
everythings taken on a hyper reality hasnt it
youre billys mother
i couldnt believe you didnt recognize me
you even interviewed me for your book
youre all in this together
we had to have financing
where should we start
your mother ruined my marriage by sleeping with my husband
you ruined my family by killing my son
gale aired it to the world
should i go on
isnt that enough
jesus youre just as whacked as your son
where do you think he got it
mental illness is heriditary
who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother
he was a smart kid but children need parental guidance
sidney is completely horror stricken
she stands in total disbelief
yeah shes been great sid
we never would have been able to it without her
debbie salt mrs
loomis looks to both derek and hallie smiling
and i couldnt have done it without you two
now who won the coin toss
hallie raises her hand
debbie points the gun at her quickly simply
sid and gale scream as a bullet through the forehead sends hallie flying back against the flat wall
her body drops to the floor
derek drops the camera completely taken back
he looks to debbie
what are you
debbie turns the gun on him
derek moves the bullet catches him in the stomach
he drops to his knees
debbie fires again
derek takes another bullet
this time dropping
his body falls near cotton who has remained suspiciously quiet through this ordeal
he eyes dereks knife that now lay near his wrists
turn to debbie in complete horror
nice kids but a little out there
what are you going to do
finish what my son started
but youll never get away with it
enter cotton weary
cotton looks up
think about it
an innocent man wrongly accused
spends time in prison where he justs sits with his righteous anger waiting planning his revenge
his life so incomprehensively ruined hes forced to take revenge on the people responsible
i guess you were just meant to be a killer
youll never get away with this
debbie moves to cotton shrugging
who would you like to shoot first cotton
just then cotton leans up freed from his bindings
with the knife in hand he lunges for debbie salt
it strikes her lodging into her chest
she goes back
cotton doesnt stop he stabs her again and again
she goes down
gale rushes to cotton as he jumps to his feet
she helps him with the last of his bindings
sid looks about at the body count on stage
she takes a deep breath
god cotton what a nightmare
im so sorry
gale gives him a hug
he hugs her back
she doesnt see as he rises the knife behind her bringing it down in one swift maniacal move
gales body jerks a moment of shock and then she goes limp as the knife lodges in her back
sidney turns just in time to see cotton toss gales body down into the orchestra pit
he turns facing sidney
the bloody knife in hand
cotton moves to dereks body where the video camera lay he pulls the tape from it
its perfect sidney
no one will ever suspect me
i have proof
im the victim
please cotton dont do this
he holds up the video cassette
murder in his eye
i get my revenge and make some fast cash
its over cotton
not until youre dead
cotton lunges for her
sid tears off slipping through the set door to
sid runs to the rear of the stage
she moves in the narrow space that exists between the scrim and the back wail
she races down it
she almost reaches the end when cotton rips through the sidney ducks bypassing him
she comes to the stage door
she turns seeing the metal ladder thats attached to the wall
it leads to the catwalk above
sid goes for it
she climbs up the ladder with lightning speed
cotton up and running is close behind
the catwalk sits above the open fly space where flats and a large chandelier are stored in the air
sid reaches the top and takes off running down to the ending
